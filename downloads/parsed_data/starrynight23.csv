"event","Enlightenment, nirvana, they say that the way to live, the way to live and be happy in life is to be completely involved but not attached to the outcome. To give it your all, but not to care. Complete involvement with no attachment. Because if you are attached to life, then death will be hell. If you are attached to a person the way you think they are and they change, the change will be hell. And so live life and put in all your effort, but do not be attached to the outcome. Ram Dass learned this on his trip to India where he converted to Hinduism. And his guru asked of him ""can't you see that everything is perfect?"" and he was angered by this question because people were dying all around them and there was poverty and disease and hatred, and his guru was telling him that everything was perfect. But you see, it is perfect, for the world could not, at this moment in time, be any other way. In Hinduism they believe that our lives are scripts, like Shakespeare wrote ""all the world's a stage and we are merely players"" well, I don't know the exact quote, but it is something like that. We are just actors in a script living out a specific task and then leaving. Do not be attached to the outcome. And at first it made sense to me, it was actually the perfect philosophy since I am so damn sentimental, until I realized, and maybe I'm wrong, but it's nice to feel, and it's nice to be attached, nice because that's living, if you don't care about the outcome just fucking kill yourself because it's all just pointless, and I agree with that, but if it's all just pointless and you don't care, well then it's even more pointless. 
And then there is this-who exactly are you? Science says that ever seven years your entire body is new again, that not one part of your body that was there seven years ago is still there which means you are completely new person then the person you were seven years ago. And if that is so, then who are you? 
I'm starting to believe in something, I think, I'm not sure what, but there has so be something, there has to be something, there just has to be.

Humans when born are helpless, comepletely at the mercy of their caretakers and not able in any way shape or form to fend for themselves. It is from that moment when we realize that we must put all our trust and dependence in the people (namely our parents) around us, that is when love is formed, that is when the idea of love is instilled in our minds, bodies and souls. And in that love forms the idea and need of love that fullfills more than just our necessities of life, but a love that fullfills us, that makes us ""whole."" And that love which we have self proclaimed and self projected into our heads, thoughts and ideas, we carry around with us, a love, as Freud might agree, turns into a searching to replace our parent (mostly the oppisite sex) in our love life, that is why so many women marry their ""fathers"" and men marry their ""mothers.""

"event","My problem with people who try to analyze poems is that they are wrong! You can never know what they mean, you can only understand a poem for how it affects you, not what you think the writer was writing about, because you'll never know, you'll just never know. On that note, poems can always heal a broken soul, or at least help to understand yourself better.
 
Jorge Luis Borges

Compass

every single thing becomes a word
in a language that someone or something, night and day
writes down in a never ending scribble,
which is the history of the world, embracing

Rome, Carthage, you, me, everyone
my life, which I do not understand, this anguish
of being enigma, accident and puzzle
and all the discordant languages of Babel

Behind each name lies that which has no name
Today I felt its nameless shadow tremble
in the blue clarity of the compass needle

whose rule extends as far as the far seas
something like a clock glimpsed in a dream
or a bird that stirs suddenly in its sleep.


Parting

Three hundred nights like three hundred walls
must rise between my love and me
and the sea will be a black art between us.

Nothing will be left but the memories
O afternoons earned with suffering
nights hoping for the sight of you
fields along my way, firmament
that I am seeing and losing...
final as marble
your absence will sadden other afternoons



William Carlos Williams

Election Day

warm sun, quiet air
an old man sits

in the doorway of
a broken house-

boards for windows
plaster falling

from between the stones
and strokes the head

of a spotted dog

This poem, oh man, this poem, wow...

20 Love Poems

I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. 

Write, for instance: ""The night is full of stars, 
and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance."" 

The night wind whirls in the sky and sings. 

I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. 
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too. 

On nights like this, I held her in my arms. 
I kissed her so many times under the infinite sky. 

She loved me, sometimes I loved her. 
How could I not have loved her large, still eyes? 

I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. 
To think I don't have her. To feel that I've lost her. 

To hear the immense night, more immense without her. 
And the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass. 

What does it matter that my love couldn't keep her. 
The night is full of stars and she is not with me. 

That's all. Far away, someone sings. Far away. 
My soul is lost without her. 

As if to bring her near, my eyes search for her. 
My heart searches for her and she is not with me. 

The same night that whitens the same trees. 
We, we who were, we are the same no longer. 

I no longer love her, true, but how much I loved her. 
My voice searched the wind to touch her ear. 

Someone else's. She will be someone else's. As she once 
belonged to my kisses. 
Her voice, her light body. Her infinite eyes. 

I no longer love her, true, but perhaps I love her. 
Love is so short and oblivion so long. 

Because on nights like this I held her in my arms, 
my soul is lost without her. 

Although this may be the last pain she causes me, 
and this may be the last poem I write for her.


Lorca

Pause of the Clock

I sat down
inside a pause in time
In a still pool
of silence;
a formidable ring
where bright stars
crashed into the twelve black
flowing numerals



Langston Hughes

Hope

Sometimes when I'm lonely
Don't know why
Keep thinking I won't be lonely
By and By


No Regrets

Out of love,
No regrets-
Though the goodness
Be wasted forever

Out of love,
No regrets-
Though the return
be never



Poems sometimes give more insight then your own thoughts on certain circumstances, because sometimes a different point of view will give you a point of view you could have never imagined. That is the thing about humans, we think that we are so high and mighty, but we have a certain preconcieved notion about things that we will never be able to see beyond. We understand the documentaion of history as what we percieve to be as writing-symbols which we named letters, and letters make up sentences and sentences make up paragraphs and so on. The thing is that we would never be able to concieve or identify other types of documentation. For example, maybe beavers set up the logs in their dam as a way of representing their history and liniage, because we would never think of that, we could never identify it. It is like showing a Kalahari Bushman a Coca-Cola bottle (watch the movie ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"") They would not even understand what the concept of Coca-Cola, but they could identify the bottle as different things-a musical instrument when blown in to, a bakers roller if turned on it's side, a spanking paddle, a seed crusher, and so on...but never once would they think ""oh, it's a Coca-Cola bottle."" As we see the beavers dam as a dam, but what other purposes may it serve that we just don't understand? Who knows? That's the problem with people, they think they are so much higher than animals, but we are animals, and how do we know who is at the top of the intelligence chain? 

Anyway, back to the poems, I was sitting in the book store attempting to read Thoreau's essays on Civil Disobendience and for the life of me my brain just kept wandering, so i plopped myself in the poetry section for some sprinkles of inspiration and these beautiful ornaments fell to me, and they are beautiful and insightful and I hope they give you the gratification they gave me.

We forget there is still so much more to know, but because we don't know it yet, we can't always realize that it's all still out there.

Love Strong

My English teacher said today, ""the beautiful thing about college is I've never met a person who walked out of college smarter then they wanted to be."" Knowledge really is about how much one applies themselves, I find it funny that people, even the smartest people I know, still somehow do not realize this. ""The whole world is teacher to the wise, the whole universe is enemy to the fool."" 

Alright, let us begin by trying to understand a table. Think of the essence of a table. You maybe thinking ""wow, what a freak, what is the purpose of trying to understand a table, as a matter of fact, what is there to even understand about a table?"" Well, consider this: We have a table, the table, let us imagine, is made of wood and metal. We understand through science (at least for those who are scientific realists) that the table is made up of molecules, and molecules are made up of atoms, so the table must them be made up of atoms. And atoms, as we understand them are made up of electrons, protons and neutrons, and therefore the table is also then made up of electrons protons and neutrons. And electrons, protons and neutrons are made up of quarks, and quarks are made up of sub-quarks and quarks are made up of superstrings, and we do not know if or what superstrings are made up of. Really after the quark scientists are not sure if they understand the subatomic particles and so on, and therefore do not understand the basic essence of the table, and therefore really we don't understand something as simple as a table when you break it down to its core. I just thought it was interesting that really we cannot know if anything exists and then on top of that we cannot even understand what we perceive to exist. Ahh, soo much to say, I wish I had the words but they escape me.

Here is a section from a wonderfully funny book, one of my favorites that I highly recommend.
The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy
By Douglas Adams

Now it is such a bizarrely impossible coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the nonexistence of God. The argument goes something like this:


""I refuse to prove that I exist,"" says God, ""for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.""

""But,"" say Man, ""the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.""

""Oh dear,"" says God, ""I hadn't though of that"" and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.



Here is the problem, everything besides the object itself that you are dealing with is representational, the word ""apple"" is not itself an apple, the sound of the word ""apple"" is not an apple, a sign for the word ""apple"" is not an apple. What is language but mere representation, as is thought. Thought, Plato believed, was an internal was of speaking to yourself. Noam Chomsky furthers this argument in ""Notion of Generative Grammar"" I believe is the title of the book, that explains that children before learning language must have a basic language of thought, or inner dialogue that images conjured up by the brain, and that this is an innate structure in human beings that enables us to then understand at a later time how to express our ideas. Another belief that a man named Anslem in the 11th Century believed was that everyone was born with the understanding of ""self"" and you cannot deny your own existence because in attempt to deny it you actually confirm it, as denying it would be contradicting yourself. This leads into the ontological argument for the existence of God which I cannot fully explain nor do I understand fully myself, so I will stop here with my blabbering. Anyway, it's nice to think and ponder your understanding of your won existence. 

As for now I have Marx to read and a very interesting short story: ""The Garden of Forking Paths"" by Borges. I do not know what it is about, but from what I understand of it, it is somewhat a story of how your life has a parallel universe. Let us break down life into a simplicity. For every decision you made you had two choices (I know most of the time you have more, but for arguments sake...) So here are your two choices, A and B. Let's say you have chosen ""A"" and then you come to your next set of choices C and D and you chose ""C"" and then the next E and F and you chose ""E"". Well if you start off at the beginning and chose ""B"" instead you would then be on a completely new path in life. A path that as you look back now, you can see not where it would have lead you, but the ability that you had to have a completely different existence. For example: when I was 11 my parents chose to move to Beverly Hills. Because of that I went to Horace Mann and then to Beverly Hills High School and in that time I met different people who shaped and formed my opinion of the world around me. But now looking back, had we not moved I would have gone to Walter Reed middle school in Studio City, and the to North Hollywood High School and who knows that would have happened to me. And therefore, what if there was a split, and for each decision you made your parallel universe took the other decision? I don't know, maybe I'll write a short story and try to figure it out. Anyway, these are my current musings. 

And I shall always leave you with words of the wise:
Oh Bob, it's incredible how even though you did not want to be an icon you formed a voice and an opinion for an entire generation, you changed the world with your songs, and even though you resented the fame, you will be immortal now, how you have changed the world, with your words, and I will never be the same...

Bob Dylan
You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go

I've seen love go by my door
It's never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow.
Been shooting in the dark too long
When somethin's not right it's wrong
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known careless love,
It's always hit me from below.
This time around it's more correct
Right on target, so direct,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Purple clover, Queen Anne lace,
Crimson hair across your face,
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of
You might be spoilin' me too much, love,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy,
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme,
Blue river runnin' slow and lazy,
I could stay with you forever
And never realize the time.

Situations have ended sad,
Relationships have all been bad.
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud.
But there's no way I can compare
All those scenes to this affair,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm doin',
Stayin' far behind without you.
Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm sayin',
Yer gonna make me give myself a good talkin' to.

I'll look for you in old Honolulu,
San Francisco, Ashtabula,
Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know.
But I'll see you in the sky above,
In the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Jennifer"

"event","Maybe I cus too much, but at least I feel. I realize now that the most important thing in the world is something that we as humans living in the 21st century have forgotten how to do because we have become so desensitized and jaded to the world around us. We have forgotten what it is like to feel. We now understand everything cerbrally, it is not that we are not compassionate or empathetic, but we process these through our minds and not our emotions. When you hear that someone has been killed most people, including me, think in their head ""wow, that is terrible"" and they are being completely sincere, but they do not feel it in their heart, their heart isn't being twisted and torn by the fact that someone has just died. Kids don't laugh at jokes anymore, they can understand that the joke is funny and aknowledge that, but they do not laugh and they do not smile, even if they think it is funny. I could not understand why there were not riots in the streets last week, I could not understand how I was so passionately enraged and people were all saying, 'yes, this is terrible' and not doing anything! Why don't we get up and scream ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" How did it come to this, how did we learn to turn off our emotions, they are what makes us alive. 
I was reading a fabulous essay by Bruno Bettelheim, a survivor of the Holocaust, the essay is entitled ""Joey: A 'Mechanical Boy'"" About a boy who was raised by dispassionate parents who did not love and care for him. He grew up believing that it was better to be a machine then a human because humans feel and machines do not. I believe that emotion is our fatal flaw, the flaw worthy of writing the great Greek tradegies about, and by eliminating that fatal flaw we will be perfect, because emotions are the greatest draw back, however, as Joey finds out at the end of this essay ""Feelings are more important than anything under the sun. Feelings, Joey had learned, are what make for humanity; their absence, for a mechanical existance."" For what is the point of being perfect? But the apathy of society has proven that we are becoming like machines, however, we still have emotion, I do not what to call it trivial emotion, but it seems to be that way, we tend to now just accept our larger circumstances, the ones we feel we cannot change or overcome, and it is those things that we should become emotional over and instead we just accept them.
And that leads me to my second topic, a topic which I cried about today so prefusely that my head is still spinning, and there is still nothing I can do about it. I had an orientation today for a wonderful organization called ""School on Wheels"" which I am now a tutor for. The organization provides tutors for homeless children and their headquarters and in the homeless capital of downtown which I experienced for the first time today. The streets were lined with homeless people, and I think about all the times someone on the street comes to ask me for change and I smile and just say ""sorry."" And as I saw these people, all these people I realized something that I think we have forgotten-they are human beings, they are flesh and bone and they breath and have eyes and can see and they are just like you and me except they have no where to live and their lives are full of so much pain and I cried like I am crying now because there is just nothing that I feel I can do about it. I read an incredibly moving peice by George Orwell that this experience reminded me of: ""But what is strange about these people is their invisibilty. For several weeks, always about the same time of day, the file of old women had hobbled past the house with their fire wood, and though they had registered themselves on my eyeballs I cannot truly say that I had seem them. Firewood was passing-that was how I saw it. It was only that one day I happened to be walking behind them, and the curious up-and-down motion of the load of wood drew my attention to the human underneath it. Then for the first time I noticed the poor old earth-colored bodies, bodies reduced to bones and leathery skin, bent double under the crushing weight. Yet I suppose I had not been five minutes of Moroccan soil before I noticed the overloading of the donkeys and was infuriated by it."" This was from his essay ""Marrakech"" when he was a police officer in Morocco. 
How is it that this has happened? How do we let the injustice continue? Homelessness, contrary to what many believe is not a choice, and yes there are people who took the wrong road which led to drugs and others are mentally challenged, but they deserve something other than the streets. God, they're humans, they're humans, why don't people see it, why aren't people enraged by it? Why aren't people enraged by the government, what is happening to this country, how it has formed our apathetic and careless view on society and for people. How have we come to this point? How are we just so blind and so willing to look it over because having to think about things would distrub our peace of mind. FUCK EVERYTHING, why can't it be differetnt, why is is so impossible for one person to change the world? Why is it so hard to make a significant difference in humanity, or maybe it just seems like it. We are too busy doing our school work or making money, and if we had to choose between sacrificing our comfort to help someone else we wouldn't, no, it is not until it effects us personally, not until our brothers and sisters and boyfriends and girlfriends come back in body bags that we will get up and fight, it is not until we get notices to go fight an unjust war that we will get up and fight, it is not until we are forced by uncontrolable circumstances to leave our homes and live on the street that we will get up and fight, it is not until it is cutting us, until it is making US bleed that we will get up and fight: And this quote explains why by Martin Niemoller:
""In Germany, they first came for the communists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Catholic. Then they came for me -- and by that time there was nobody left to speak up.""
This is why history repeats itself.

So who is going to stand up with me? The problem is that power is in the numbers, we need to unite to be heard, that is how it has to be, unfortunately, but we can make a difference, I know it and I can feel it, but we need to sacrifice that comfort, don't let history repeat itself, you are fighting for your life too, even if you don't know it yet.

Where shall I begin? It seems fit to discuss the next generation, our generation, the generation which will have to carry the burdens and ramifications of the downfalls of our corrupt and brainwashing government. We are the one's who will be almost inevitably sent to war-don't believe me? People usually don't, they should learn by now that they should, since so far all of my so-called ""conspiricy theories"" have been correct. Like in World War II, they kept saying that it won't happen to them. It won't happen to us. It won't happen to us. It won't happen to us. Fuck, it happened to us. What if you put a lobster in a pot of cold water and you keep turning the heat up very slowly? When does the lobster realize that it's time to get out? There is a very small window of oppertunity, we have just missed our window of oppertunity, the only other step now before it's all over is revolution, anarchy, or stay on the runaway train and dive into the depths of hell with the bushies and their evangelical masterbation. 
And FUCK Nader, I don't give a fuck what point he was trying to make, he's a fucking idiot who needs to be gotten rid of in the appropriate manner.
This is not going to be good, 249 to 211, or is it 269 to 207 why does every channel have a different reading, why is it that I KNOW that the system was corrupted somewhere, that this is a very twisted election with a lot of underground arm twisting going on, I don't even know what to say except that 1984 is only 20 years late and this is the end of democracy as we know it and it is the end of the American dominance, let's all move to Japan or China, they will be the next world super powers, but America, it's been run into the ground just like the rest of Bush's companies.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. We are FUCKED.

"event","That movie was a fucking trip, you're going to have to see it at least five times before it permiates your skull and even begins to osmosize into your brain. 
Before I go on (and in the spirit of High Fidelity)
Top Ten Movies I Recommend at this point in time:
1) Network
2) Eternal Sunshine
3) Truman Show
4) 1000 Clowns
5) High Fidelity
6) Motorcycle Diaries
7) I heart Huckabees
8) Rushmore
9) Citizen Kane ( I know it's cliche, but it's cliche for a reason)
10) Annie Hall (crap, and Manhattan, Woody Allen should go higher but I don't feel like renumbering, so these aren't in order or preference)

Okay, so I Heart Huckabees, well, it made me think, which is definately a first step with the film industry these days who are not trying to fullfill any sort of higher intelectual capacity. 
It's funny, you don't know what's going to happen until it happens, but you don't know if it happened because you were waiting or because it was supposed to happen. Like Shrodingers you won't know if it's dead until you open the box.

Funny how we always thought that science could answer ""Why?"" When really all it can answer is ""How?"" If you look at it this way, as explained so well by my new favorite W.T. Stace who has inspired me to be a scienfitic instrumentalist. Stace explains that if a child witnesses water freeze for the first time and asks what happened? You would explain that the temperture dropped causing the molecules in the water to slow and that caused the water to turn to ice. And if the child asks why? You answer the same way. But you cannot answer the same response to both the question ""how"" and ""why?"" For human happenings there is an answer:
What is that?
It is a table.
Why is it a table?
Beacuse someone built it because they needed a device to put their things on.
Aristotle was the first to have recorded this why and how theory saying that science needed to answer four basic questions: the material cause-what it is composed of. the formal cause-what it is. the efficient cause-how it came to be. and the final cuase-why it came to be. However the final cause was rejected because you cannot answer why in science.
I Heart Huckabees dealt with the question why? Why did this happen? We spend our time dwelling, dwelling on the inevitable of what has already passed. I have been holding on to these coincidences, these strange synchronicities in my life that I have been trying to figure out. And I scream to what ever power may be if there is and I ask what it is trying to tell me? What are these signs all about? Until I realized that it does not matter, because it may all just be random acts of living in life on this planet in the universe, these things happen not because of some greater reason, but rather as a reason specifically now that they have happened to you, and they are significant not because they were supposed to happen, but because they did happen. So the ""Why?"" shouldn't concern us, should it?
Another thing it deals with is unity, where do I stop and you start? In science they say that no matter how close you get to something, you can always get closer-like in the wonderful movie ""I.Q."" when Tim Robbins Meg Ryan are on the dance floor and she says she cannot ever come to him because no matter how many steps she takes she has to take another step of half the distance and keep covering halfs (sorry this is not a very good description) and there are infinite halfs and therefore she'll never reach him. But if we could put on glasses that enabled us only to see atoms, and not full forms, the entire world would be one, the entire universe would be one, nothing would be decipherable from each other, just a wall of atoms, and I am connected to this canvas, and to you, and to the people on the other side of the world and to the president and to the red ants in south America and to the tortoises of the Galapagos and you are me and I am you and we are one and we are one with the universe and that it what it means to be at one with everything and everyone pervading all time and space. And then we'd all be one. Hummmm....something to ponder. 

This is somewhat pertinent from the play ""Copenhagen"" by Michael Frayn:
Bohr: I always knew you'd be picking your way step by step down the slope behind me. digging all the capsized meanings and implications out of the snow.
Margrethe: The faster you ski the sooner you're across the cracks and crevasses.
Heisenberg: The faster you ski the better you think.
Bohr: Not to disagree, but that is most...most interesting.
Heisenberg: By which you mean it's nonsense. But ut's not nonsesnse. Decisions make themselves when you're coming downhill at seventy kilometers an hour. Suddenly there's the edge of nothing ness in front of you. Swerve left? Swerve right? Or think about it and die? In your head you swerve both ways...
It's a good play, read it.

Anyway, there is so much to think so much to know, half of me wants to be able to learn forever, the other part is already frazzeled with information and wants to party. What to do? What to do? Sit home and read Yanomamo, a tale about a warrior culture in South America. There is so much to do, swerve left? swerve right? let me think about it...

"event","I was talking to a friend about the tax issues on the bill and about everyone's fear of raising taxes. She said that someone she knew who had just become successful had something to the point of 'now that I'm making X amount of dollars I'm becoming a Republican.' 
My response to that goes something like-why don't we just abolish taxes, people don't like paying them anyway, it's our hard earned money. And if your house catches on fire, i'll just laugh as you try to put it out yourself because there won't be any firemen, and if you get mugged I'll just say' oh well sucks for you' because there won't be any policemen. And you'll have to replace your tires every couple of months because there won't be anyone to pave the roads because that's were your fucking taxes go, they go to educate your children and to pave the roads and to protect yourself and your family and your neighborhood. Yes, the money is somethings, and very often used inefficiently, but the solution is not to CUT taxes, it's to figure out how to put them to better use. People hate having their money taken away on April 15, but rarely do they think about where it's going, it's really just going right back to them. That is why I haven't stopped believing that selfishness is the inherent underlying motive of human kind, unfortunately.

Just a thought, prove me wrong and I will be forever obliged

If I believed in God I would say he was divinely inspired, but there are a lot of problems with the argument of scripture which I will not get in to but if you want to read my phil of religion midterm I will be more than happy to share. The Naturalists in the argument of scripture believe that the bible is as divinely inspired as any other incredible writing, like Plato or Shakespeare or yes, Dylan. Nothing helps more than sitting and listening to Dylan to answer all your questions, I can thank Josh for that.

They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones.
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.

They walked along by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright.
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate.

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walkin' by the arcade.
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up,
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.

He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere.
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in.
Maybe she'll pick him out again, how long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate.

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within.
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring.
She was born in spring, but I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.


Watch the Long Way Around about Ewan McGregors motocycle trip around the world, then you'll understand why I need to leave, then maybe you'll understand. I'm going skydiving next weekend for anyone with the interest to come, it's $179 for first jumpers. 

I forgot to believe, believe in what? Myself I guess, if that is all there is to believe in, there are times, times like now that I want to believe so much, that I scream to what ever may be out there, God are you there? Do you exist? I never get an answer, but of course not, but I want to believe, only without an answer it makes it difficult to believe, it's like sitting in an empty room in the middle on no where and yelling to the outside to see if there is soneone there, and no one answers, but you still believe someone is out there.

C.S. Lewis would disagree, for you will not find GOD on earth, just as you will not find Shakespeare in his plays. Shakespeare is his plays, he is the creator and so his entire play is him, he is the world of the play, as Lewis says God is to his creation, the Earth. Can I believe that? Lewis says that if you do not believe, no where you will look will make you believe, I suppose he's right. 

There is so much to think about, so many questions to answer that we will never have the capacity to answer. Yet still I sit here and think about you, when will all wandering eyes stop straying to you, all thoughts stop wandering to you, and suddenly nothing is without you, except me. It's torture you know, cruel and unusual punishment for a girl with a soul like mine.

Too much thinking is bad, you're right, because even with all the thinking in the world, nothing will happen until it is put into action. Everything is so interesting, so incredible and eye opening and the world is so incredible, I just can't get over how incredible. I don't believe in the teleological argument because I do not believe the universe displays a great deal of teleological order, but I still think it is beautiful.

"event","THE RED SOX WON!!!!!!! Wow, it's amazing how much you can learn about something with the motivation, too bad it was baseball and not my philosophy of religion. But that is slowly coming as well.

Anyway I believe, and please laugh at me, i don't care. But I think that tonight was very symbolic. People were talking about how it would have been ironic for Boston to play Houston since they represent Kerry and Bush respectively, but I think the fact the Houston didn't even MAKE IT into the world series is symbolic in itself. Also, the Red Sox won at the Cardinals studium which just so happens to be named Bush Stadium. Now, we had quite a dillema last presidential election year with the whole hanging chad swinging chad tid bit, literaly, and there was talk that we need a land slide if we want to prevent chaos in the streets this year. Well there was no doubt about it, the Red Sox swept the Cardinals when everyone said that they were going to lose, they SWEPT them, now i'm no conspiracy theorist, but i think that this could be an omen, a sign that maybe that the times are a'changin as Bob Dylan would so eloquently put it. Anyway, just a thought. Much LOVE and YAY RED SOX, you deserved it, and you earned it (because they're reading this right? haha) 

Let's hope that all this Boston momentum and winning streak will last a couple more days.
Love and love

"event","I look at a person like Che and I know that a revolution is due, is long over due, there is a revolution brewing. But I see him and I see his ideas and ideals and I see how they failed. So you throw over a government, but what do you put in its place? I've looked at writing from Socrates and Plato to Locke and Hobbes and Machiavelli and Rousseau and Mill to name a few not to mention of course good old Marx, and their governments in theory, well most of them, sound wonderful, ideal, would create justice and equality, maintain civic virtue, but they will not work. They will not work because of human nature, because there is no such thing as ""equality."" The equalizer in life that makes kings and peasants on the same level is that we all die. You shoot a king in the head and a peasant in the head and they will both come to their mortal end. But when we are living, humans do not like to think of themselves as equals, not really. There is no easy solution to the problem, not one that a revolution would fix, which is frustrating because change over time is a slow and grueling process in which people get restless when they can not witness the change. But what is the solution to poverty? What is the solution to the extremeness of the classes? How do we fix the corruption of big coorporations? Of the government? Do we create anarchy? Do we revolt? How do we change the system which has been so deeply rooted into the heart of our society? Human nature lies on survival of the fitest, relies on greed and selfishness, it is not a judgement that I pass on humans, more of a plain scientific obersvation. And because of that human drive to succeed, we will not let ourselves be equals, and therefore communism will never work, nor will Locke's or Hobbe's ideas. But there is injustice and the injustice should be served, it must be served, but how? I want to change the world, I want to be a revolutionary, but what is the answer? How do we right the wrongs that we have created? I guess I need to live a little more before I will know anything.

The Plan: Land in Peru with my bike, even though I love Harley's I'd get one a little more reliable for the dirt roads. Make my way across to Machu Picchu, down to Chile, across to Argentina and then across to Brazil. I'm aiming at a month and a half, I guess I'll just keep going until school has to start and stop where ever is most convenient. But I have to go, anyone who wants to come is invited, the more the merrier. But the road is calling me and the world is calling me and I've got to get out and see life, see how people live, sick of this city with all these fake ideas, what is the rest of the world like? There is so much that I am missing and I'm aching to see it, see it all and love it all and love human beings because they are human, it is okay to be fatally flawed, we all are aren't we? So I'm going because I have to, I have to if it's the last thing I do on this Earth I have to because the wind is calling and the road is calling and the Earth is calling and I'm out of here. Need to be a bird, need to fly like the wild wind that I am. Sometimes you need to let go of here to get to there, sometimes the only way to find your way home is to run away for a while, and see what it's like where you're a little less comfortable.

I'm mad and I'm burning, want to get up and scream like Howard Beale ""I'm Mad As Hell And I'm Not Going To Take It Anymore!!!"" So then what am I going to take? Maybe only the road can answer that question for me. I find that I mold myself to fit the interests of other people. It's something I have been critisized for quite a bit, but it's made me such a well rounded person and I certainly have not lost myself in the process. One introduced me to Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell, to Whitman and Kerouac and Thompson and Wes Anderson movies and 1000 Clowns to the Stones and The Band. Another gave me snowboarding and motorcycle riding, sailing and surfing and rugby. And another gave me baseball and Frazen and Hedberg and Wilco and the Shins and Judaism and a better understanding of myself. But I love painting and writing poetry and stories and I love dancing in the rain and photography and sky diving and being spontaneous and mad. It's okay to learn from other people it's okay to get into what they're into because the way you learn new things is by being introduced to them, and if you want to be able to talk to someone, learn about what they like, and even if they leave your life, you'll have that knowledge and when someone else comes around who likes baseball or Dylan or riding, you'll know how to talk to them and you might even find that you love it too, not for them, but for yourself. But the more people who rub off on me, the more interesting I get, so you know what, it's okay to take from other people to expand yourself, and that's what I'm doing, and so far it's worked out great. 

It's a beautiful world out there, I keep forgetting that, keep needing to remind myself that. I was terriby sick this week, but I got up and took my clothes off and run through the streets in the rain anyway, because God knows how often it rains here in Los Angeles, and I'm not going to let a silly little cold keep me from dancing in the rain. Oh it is so beautiful, so beautiful when you forget. What is next for us? We shall see, we shall see, but I hear my calling somewhere in the distance waiting for me.

For love of self and country

"event","When did everyone become a political expert? Can someone please tell me. Okay, I'm no political expert, but may I say that with a list of books out with titles such as these: ""Bushwhacked"" ""Bush on the Couch"" ""Bushisms"" ""Shrub"" ""The I Hate G.W.B Reader"" ""50 reasons not to vote for G.W.B"" ""Worse than Watergate"" and ""Misunderestimated"" something is obviously wrong with the administration. I mean presidents have been hated, but not to this violent and passionate extent. I looked and as much slander as there was going on during the Clinton/Lewinsky era, it was not nearly to the extent that the Bush books are coming out.
   Right now I have to say that both the dems and reps have been reduced to stupid little children who are poking each other and then when the mom comes in the both cry ""no he started it, no he started it."" It's like fuck, you're supposed to be running the country, grow up a little. And then there's fucking Ann Coulter, who fucking gave this woman permission to open her stupid blonde bimbo mouth? Who the hell is she anyway? Who write a book called ""How To Talk To A Liberal (If You Must)"" I mean could there be a more childish title? And who died and made Bill O'Reily and Sean Hannity the political experts? Not that all dems are great, I mean Michael Moore has his problems too, everyone has an opinion and these guys are not afraid to make sure the whole world knows it. I don't have any answers, but I promise you people like Couler and O'Reily are not going to be the guys to provide us with them. 
    It is two weeks before the election, if you are 18 and are not registered then you are an official asshole. I'm going to Vegas to work on the campaign the weekend before the election, exciting stuff. 

    Alright, enough with the politics because I'm sure everyone it tired of it. I'm planning my birthday party, i'll e-mail you all about it in a couple days. 

    And now I am going to post lyrics to ""We Didn't Light The Fire"" by Billy Joel because they're great and I need to ask:
Did you write the book of love
And do you believe in God about
If the bible tells you so?
And do you believe in Rock and Roll
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well I know that you're in love with him
Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man I dig those rythem and blues
I was a lonely teenage brockin' buck
with a pink carnation and a pick up truck
But i knew that I was out of luck the day the music died

(Before Billy Joel, can I please just say that I have THE BEST FUCKING TASTE IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!! Man I have such good taste, and there is nothing better than dancing in the rain and singing at the top of your lungs. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL)

"event","why was i so anti this? why am i still anti this?

strange is the fact that everything is changing

I couldn't control the time
like i couldn't control you
and the time passed
and you passed with the time

i wanted the time to pass, so quickly that it was like it never even happened. and they said it would pass, and now it has. am i sorry? and am I sad? those are questions that I have been telling myself I d not need to answer because it is pointeless to regret, it is pointless to mourn. IT IS IMPORTANT TO FEEL. I feel, I feel, I feel. I love feeling, anything, sadness, happiness, even lonliness. I love to know that I can feel, and I am feeling right now. The time has passed, and it is I who passed with the time. It will just keep going, is there use to mourn the death of the time gone by? What was I before I was born? Dead? And what will I be after I die? Alive? They say there's a heaven for those who will wait. Some say it's worth it, but I say it's ain't. I'd rather laugh with the sinner's than cry with the saints. The sinners are much more fun-you know that only the good die young. So what's the point of being good? I am so depressed. I am so depressed. Because everyone is finally getting to live their lives, and I am still stuck here in limbo. I am a walking body, where is my soul? Everything changes, everything changes, just keep telling yourself that everything changes, and maybe everything will stay the same.

"event","What I hated for so long is fnially ending, yet for some reason I mourn the death of my enemy. The struggle is finally coming to an end, the uphill battle will soon turn downhill, and I will be left in a new world that I do not know, and suddenly the old world doesn't seem as bad as I thought it was. 
I'm scared.
In fact, I'm terrified.
There is no path for me to follow anymore, the path is now mine to create and I can do with it what I please. I always thought I liked change, but now I don't know anymore. 
High School is ending. One more weekend and I will be a college student. Who thought this day would come? It seemed like high school was a purpetual prison. Now suddenly I've been granted my freedom, and maybe freedom isn't as wonderful as it had been preconcieved.
I didn't think I would be sad on this day. Maybe if I was going somewhere other then where I was going I wouldn't be, but I am.
I guess I should be excited, the world is at my fingertips, it is mine to grasp and put in my pocket and make it mine. 
I flipped through the yearbook, looked at all the faces that I never made the effort to meet. This was my yearbook, this is my graduating class, this is it. 
Time goes by so fast and so slow, and then when you open your eyes, it's over. 
I will not be sad to leave Beverly, but I will miss it.
I'm scared.
Life is not what I thought it would be, now that I have the reins in my hand. Life is not what I thought it would be at all, not my life.
This is going to be good right? Please tell me that everything is going to be okay."

"event","In these deep solitudes and awful cells, 
    Where heav'nly-pensive contemplation dwells,
    And ever-musing melancholy reigns;
    What means this tumult in a vestal's veins?
    Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat?
    Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat?
    Yet, yet I love!--From Abelard it came,
    And Eloisa yet must kiss the name.

        Dear fatal name! rest ever unreveal'd,
  Nor pass these lips in holy silence seal'd.
  Hide it, my heart, within that close disguise,
  Where mix'd with God's, his lov'd idea lies:
  O write it not, my hand--the name appears
  Already written--wash it out, my tears!
  In vain lost Eloisa weeps and prays,
  Her heart still dictates, and her hand obeys.

      Relentless walls! whose darksome round contains
  Repentant sighs, and voluntary pains:
  Ye rugged rocks! which holy knees have worn;
  Ye grots and caverns shagg'd with horrid thorn!
  Shrines! where their vigils pale-ey'd virgins keep,
  And pitying saints, whose statues learn to weep!
  Though cold like you, unmov'd, and silent grown,
  I have not yet forgot myself to stone.
  All is not Heav'n's while Abelard has part,
  Still rebel nature holds out half my heart;
  Nor pray'rs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain,
  Nor tears, for ages, taught to flow in vain.

      Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose,
  That well-known name awakens all my woes.
  Oh name for ever sad! for ever dear!
  Still breath'd in sighs, still usher'd with a tear.
  I tremble too, where'er my own I find,
  Some dire misfortune follows close behind.
  Line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow,
  Led through a sad variety of woe:
  Now warm in love, now with'ring in thy bloom,
  Lost in a convent's solitary gloom!
  There stern religion quench'd th' unwilling flame,
  There died the best of passions, love and fame.

      Yet write, oh write me all, that I may join
  Griefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to thine.
  Nor foes nor fortune take this pow'r away;
  And is my Abelard less kind than they?
  Tears still are mine, and those I need not spare,
  Love but demands what else were shed in pray'r;
  No happier task these faded eyes pursue;
  To read and weep is all they now can do.

      Then share thy pain, allow that sad relief;
  Ah, more than share it! give me all thy grief.
  Heav'n first taught letters for some wretch's aid,
  Some banish'd lover, or some captive maid;
  They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,
  Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires,
  The virgin's wish without her fears impart,
  Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart,
  Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,
  And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole.

      Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame,
    When Love approach'd me under Friendship's name;
  My fancy form'd thee of angelic kind,
  Some emanation of th' all-beauteous Mind.
  Those smiling eyes, attemp'ring ev'ry day,
  Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day.
  Guiltless I gaz'd; heav'n listen'd while you sung;
  And truths divine came mended from that tongue.
  From lips like those what precept fail'd to move?
  Too soon they taught me 'twas no sin to love.
  Back through the paths of pleasing sense I ran,
  Nor wish'd an Angel whom I lov'd a Man.
  Dim and remote the joys of saints I see;
  Nor envy them, that heav'n I lose for thee.

      How oft, when press'd to marriage, have I said,
  Curse on all laws but those which love has made!
  Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,
  Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies,
  Let wealth, let honour, wait the wedded dame,
  August her deed, and sacred be her fame;
  Before true passion all those views remove,
  Fame, wealth, and honour! what are you to Love?
  The jealous God, when we profane his fires,
  Those restless passions in revenge inspires;
  And bids them make mistaken mortals groan,
  Who seek in love for aught but love alone.
  Should at my feet the world's great master fall,
  Himself, his throne, his world, I'd scorn 'em all:
  Not Caesar's empress would I deign to prove;
  No, make me mistress to the man I love;
  If there be yet another name more free,
  More fond than mistress, make me that to thee!
  Oh happy state! when souls each other draw,
  When love is liberty, and nature, law:
  All then is full, possessing, and possess'd,
  No craving void left aching in the breast:
  Ev'n thought meets thought, ere from the lips it part,
  And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart.
  This sure is bliss (if bliss on earth there be)
  And once the lot of Abelard and me.

      Alas, how chang'd! what sudden horrors rise!
  A naked lover bound and bleeding lies!
  Where, where was Eloise? her voice, her hand,
  Her poniard, had oppos'd the dire command.
  Barbarian, stay! that bloody stroke restrain;
  The crime was common, common be the pain.
  I can no more; by shame, by rage suppress'd,
  Let tears, and burning blushes speak the rest.

    Canst thou forget that sad, that solemn day,
  When victims at yon altar's foot we lay?
  Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell,
  When, warm in youth, I bade the world farewell?
  As with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil,
  The shrines all trembl'd, and the lamps grew pale:
  Heav'n scarce believ'd the conquest it survey'd,
  And saints with wonder heard the vows I made.
  Yet then, to those dread altars as I drew,
  Not on the Cross my eyes were fix'd, but you:
  Not grace, or zeal, love only was my call,
  And if I lose thy love, I lose my all.
  Come! with thy looks, thy words, relieve my woe;
  Those still at least are left thee to bestow.
  Still on that breast enamour'd let me lie,
  Still drink delicious poison from thy eye,
  Pant on thy lip, and to thy heart be press'd;
  Give all thou canst--and let me dream the rest.
  Ah no! instruct me other joys to prize,
  With other beauties charm my partial eyes,
  Full in my view set all the bright abode,
  And make my soul quit Abelard for God.

    Ah, think at least thy flock deserves thy care,
  Plants of thy hand, and children of thy pray'r.
  From the false world in early youth they fled,
  By thee to mountains, wilds, and deserts led.
  You rais'd these hallow'd walls; the desert smil'd,
  And Paradise was open'd in the wild.
  No weeping orphan saw his father's stores
  Our shrines irradiate, or emblaze the floors;
  No silver saints, by dying misers giv'n,
  Here brib'd the rage of ill-requited heav'n:
  But such plain roofs as piety could raise,
  And only vocal with the Maker's praise.
  In these lone walls (their days eternal bound)
  These moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crown'd,
  Where awful arches make a noonday night,
  And the dim windows shed a solemn light;
  Thy eyes diffus'd a reconciling ray,
  And gleams of glory brighten'd all the day.
  But now no face divine contentment wears,
  'Tis all blank sadness, or continual tears.
  See how the force of others' pray'rs I try,
  (O pious fraud of am'rous charity!)
  But why should I on others' pray'rs depend?
  Come thou, my father, brother, husband, friend!
  Ah let thy handmaid, sister, daughter move,
  And all those tender names in one, thy love!
  The darksome pines that o'er yon rocks reclin'd
  Wave high, and murmur to the hollow wind,
  The wand'ring streams that shine between the hills,
  The grots that echo to the tinkling rills,
  The dying gales that pant upon the trees,
  The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze;
  No more these scenes my meditation aid,
  Or lull to rest the visionary maid.
  But o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves,
  Long-sounding aisles, and intermingled graves,
  Black Melancholy sits, and round her throws
  A death-like silence, and a dread repose:
  Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene,
  Shades ev'ry flow'r, and darkens ev'ry green,
  Deepens the murmur of the falling floods,
  And breathes a browner horror on the woods.

    Yet here for ever, ever must I stay;
  Sad proof how well a lover can obey!
  Death, only death, can break the lasting chain;
  And here, ev'n then, shall my cold dust remain,
  Here all its frailties, all its flames resign,
  And wait till 'tis no sin to mix with thine.

    Ah wretch! believ'd the spouse of God in vain,
  Confess'd within the slave of love and man.
  Assist me, Heav'n! but whence arose that pray'r?
  Sprung it from piety, or from despair?
  Ev'n here, where frozen chastity retires,
  Love finds an altar for forbidden fires.
  I ought to grieve, but cannot what I ought;
  I mourn the lover, not lament the fault;
  I view my crime, but kindle at the view,
  Repent old pleasures, and solicit new;
  Now turn'd to Heav'n, I weep my past offence,
  Now think of thee, and curse my innocence.
  Of all affliction taught a lover yet,
  'Tis sure the hardest science to forget!
  How shall I lose the sin, yet keep the sense,
  And love th' offender, yet detest th' offence?
  How the dear object from the crime remove,
  Or how distinguish penitence from love?
  Unequal task! a passion to resign,
  For hearts so touch'd, so pierc'd, so lost as mine.
  Ere such a soul regains its peaceful state,
  How often must it love, how often hate!
  How often hope, despair, resent, regret,
  Conceal, disdain--do all things but forget.
  But let Heav'n seize it, all at once 'tis fir'd;
  Not touch'd, but rapt; not waken'd, but inspir'd!
  Oh come! oh teach me nature to subdue,
  Renounce my love, my life, myself--and you.
  Fill my fond heart with God alone, for he
  Alone can rival, can succeed to thee.

    How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!
  The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
  Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!
  Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;
  Labour and rest, that equal periods keep;
  ""Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep;""
  Desires compos'd, affections ever ev'n,
  Tears that delight, and sighs that waft to Heav'n.
  Grace shines around her with serenest beams,
  And whisp'ring angels prompt her golden dreams.
  For her th' unfading rose of Eden blooms,
  And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes,
  For her the Spouse prepares the bridal ring,
  For her white virgins hymeneals sing,
  To sounds of heav'nly harps she dies away,
  And melts in visions of eternal day.

    Far other dreams my erring soul employ,
  Far other raptures, of unholy joy:
  When at the close of each sad, sorrowing day,
  Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away,
  Then conscience sleeps, and leaving nature free,
  All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee.
  Oh curs'd, dear horrors of all-conscious night!
  How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight!
  Provoking Daemons all restraint remove,
  And stir within me every source of love.
  I hear thee, view thee, gaze o'er all thy charms,
  And round thy phantom glue my clasping arms.
  I wake--no more I hear, no more I view,
  The phantom flies me, as unkind as you.
  I call aloud; it hears not what I say;
  I stretch my empty arms; it glides away.
  To dream once more I close my willing eyes;
  Ye soft illusions, dear deceits, arise!
  Alas, no more--methinks we wand'ring go
  Through dreary wastes, and weep each other's woe,
  Where round some mould'ring tower pale ivy creeps,
  And low-brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps.
  Sudden you mount, you beckon from the skies;
  Clouds interpose, waves roar, and winds arise.
  I shriek, start up, the same sad prospect find,
  And wake to all the griefs I left behind.

    For thee the fates, severely kind, ordain
  A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain;
  Thy life a long, dead calm of fix'd repose;
  No pulse that riots, and no blood that glows.
  Still as the sea, ere winds were taught to blow,
  Or moving spirit bade the waters flow;
  Soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiv'n,
  And mild as opening gleams of promis'd heav'n.

    Come, Abelard! for what hast thou to dread?
  The torch of Venus burns not for the dead.
  Nature stands check'd; Religion disapproves;
  Ev'n thou art cold--yet Eloisa loves.
  Ah hopeless, lasting flames! like those that burn
  To light the dead, and warm th' unfruitful urn.

    What scenes appear where'er I turn my view?
  The dear ideas, where I fly, pursue,
  Rise in the grove, before the altar rise,
  Stain all my soul, and wanton in my eyes.
  I waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee,
  Thy image steals between my God and me,
  Thy voice I seem in ev'ry hymn to hear,
  With ev'ry bead I drop too soft a tear.
  When from the censer clouds of fragrance roll,
  And swelling organs lift the rising soul,
  One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight,
  Priests, tapers, temples, swim before my sight:
  In seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd,
  While altars blaze, and angels tremble round.

    While prostrate here in humble grief I lie,
  Kind, virtuous drops just gath'ring in my eye,
  While praying, trembling, in the dust I roll,
  And dawning grace is op'ning on my soul:
  Come, if thou dar'st, all charming as thou art!
  Oppose thyself to Heav'n; dispute my heart;
  Come, with one glance of those deluding eyes
  Blot out each bright idea of the skies;
  Take back that grace, those sorrows, and those tears;
  Take back my fruitless penitence and pray'rs;
  Snatch me, just mounting, from the blest abode;
  Assist the fiends, and tear me from my God!

    No, fly me, fly me, far as pole from pole;
  Rise Alps between us! and whole oceans roll!
  Ah, come not, write not, think not once of me,
  Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee.
  Thy oaths I quit, thy memory resign;
  Forget, renounce me, hate whate'er was mine.
  Fair eyes, and tempting looks (which yet I view!)
  Long lov'd, ador'd ideas, all adieu!
  Oh Grace serene! oh virtue heav'nly fair!
  Divine oblivion of low-thoughted care!
  Fresh blooming hope, gay daughter of the sky!
  And faith, our early immortality!
  Enter, each mild, each amicable guest;
  Receive, and wrap me in eternal rest!

    See in her cell sad Eloisa spread,
  Propp'd on some tomb, a neighbour of the dead.
  In each low wind methinks a spirit calls,
  And more than echoes talk along the walls.
  Here, as I watch'd the dying lamps around,
  From yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound.
  ""Come, sister, come!"" (it said, or seem'd to say)
  ""Thy place is here, sad sister, come away!
  Once like thyself, I trembled, wept, and pray'd,
  Love's victim then, though now a sainted maid:
  But all is calm in this eternal sleep;
  Here grief forgets to groan, and love to weep,
  Ev'n superstition loses ev'ry fear:
  For God, not man, absolves our frailties here.""

    I come, I come! prepare your roseate bow'rs,
  Celestial palms, and ever-blooming flow'rs.
  Thither, where sinners may have rest, I go,
  Where flames refin'd in breasts seraphic glow:
  Thou, Abelard! the last sad office pay,
  And smooth my passage to the realms of day;
  See my lips tremble, and my eye-balls roll,
  Suck my last breath, and catch my flying soul!
  Ah no--in sacred vestments may'st thou stand,
  The hallow'd taper trembling in thy hand,
  Present the cross before my lifted eye,
  Teach me at once, and learn of me to die.
  Ah then, thy once-lov'd Eloisa see!
  It will be then no crime to gaze on me.
  See from my cheek the transient roses fly!
  See the last sparkle languish in my eye!
  Till ev'ry motion, pulse, and breath be o'er;
  And ev'n my Abelard be lov'd no more.
  O Death all-eloquent! you only prove
  What dust we dote on, when 'tis man we love.

    Then too, when fate shall thy fair frame destroy,
  (That cause of all my guilt, and all my joy)
  In trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drown'd,
  Bright clouds descend, and angels watch thee round,
  From op'ning skies may streaming glories shine,
  And saints embrace thee with a love like mine.

    May one kind grave unite each hapless name,
  And graft my love immortal on thy fame!
  Then, ages hence, when all my woes are o'er,
  When this rebellious heart shall beat no more;
  If ever chance two wand'ring lovers brings
  To Paraclete's white walls and silver springs,
  O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads,
  And drink the falling tears each other sheds;
  Then sadly say, with mutual pity mov'd,
  ""Oh may we never love as these have lov'd!""

  From the full choir when loud Hosannas rise,
  And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice,
  Amid that scene if some relenting eye
  Glance on the stone where our cold relics lie,
  Devotion's self shall steal a thought from Heav'n,
  One human tear shall drop and be forgiv'n.
  And sure, if fate some future bard shall join
  In sad similitude of griefs to mine,
  Condemn'd whole years in absence to deplore,
  And image charms he must behold no more;
  Such if there be, who loves so long, so well;
  Let him our sad, our tender story tell;
  The well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost;
  He best can paint 'em, who shall feel 'em most. 

~Alexander Pope

going to pop, going to burst, cannot breathe, not yet. Nothing goes as planned. 
Why would it? How could it? 
You don't get what you want-well sometimes you do but it ends up being different from what you thought.
I can't say, I've forgotten how to talk somewhere between the screaming silences.
I'm lost again.

i'm really sad right now, i just am. you know how sometimes you just get sad? that's how it is right now.
i wrote a great witty reparte for my editorial, it's hillarious, it was the first time i actually laughed out loud at my writing, i was quite proud. 
i talked to someone today that i haven't spoken to in many many years, it was wonderful, i realize how wonderful having old friends who knew you way back when are. it was wonderful, just wonderful. Even so, i'm still sad. I can't wait to go away again. sometimes i think i should go away for college, it's so nice to go away. i'd like to go away. 
i know my writing it juvinille right now, but that's just the way i'm feeling.
is it better to be sinned against then sinning? je ne sais pas. shakepseare was a fucking genius, amazing amazing.

"event","The world imposed upon her strength and courage, yet broke her down with doubt. There was no thin line for her between love and hate, they blended into eachother like colors on a pallet. Torn between right and wrong there was no black and white definition, all there was to comfort her was shades of gray. Millions and millions of shades of gray. 
She walked through the labryinth, sword in hand, contemplating who deserves to die more, herself, or the beast? No one would be there to save her, but what's more is that no one would come to save it. 
Humans are the definition of their enviroment-all they know is what they have experienced, and that is all they will die with. 
The world is an onion, unwrap it piece by piece, tear it apart at the seems, eat it whole. 
I don't care that people think i'm weird, I am weird, to them at least, but they are all weird to me. It really depends on the definition of weird. 
I'm trying to open my brain waves, they are stuck again and I am having trouble creating cohesive sentences. My fingers are typing the gibberish of the scrabmled code ripping through my brain to fast to decode. 
Passion lies in the gut and not in the heart. The heart has no eyes, is easily pursuaded, and always fooled. The gut knows better then to fall for those devious tricks. But the brain will always believe the heart over the gut. Which will you chose?

life is beautiful. the patterns it creates makes me think for a second that there is more than just this. i will never know i guess, never know until it's too late. that's the beauty and the irony of it. it is forever more than nothing to you.

"event","I've been feeling rather helpless lately, needing some sort of verification that my life and hard work are actually worth the effort, that someone is noticing that I am alive. I was just being an idiot, I got over it! 
I am having so much fun with this Wesley Clark campaign that I realized that I make a difference and I don't need anyone to tell me that I'm special or that I'm doing good, though it would be nice to hear every once in a while. 
The past is behind me, and as far as I'm concerned, completely forgotten, earased, and never to be congured up for any reason again. Book closed, sealed, locked and that story has ended (along with my book!) I guess that finishing my book sort of finally finishes that area in my life, seals it with a wax stamp and sends it on it's way to never never land.
And now I'm fresh, a new pallet, I'm doing a lot, I'm loving it all, and magically I'm okay so far. I'm the proud owner and head coordinator of TeensForClark.com and soon to be owner of StudentsForClarkLA.com 
I'm really a part of something, a part of something huge, that could potentially change the US if not the world (at least for four to eight years) I could help actually change the world, and that's such a great feelings! So empowering. On top of that, book sales look good, hopefully I'll get it sold before I'm 18, that would be ideal.
Other then that, still doing the normal ruitine. A new LA Youth came out, paste up for Highlights is Monday, Broadcast goes on air Tuesday, my paper in UCLA is due tomorrow, I've got Teen Line tomorrow, Copy for LA Youth is due in a month (yay for Addison and Hot Hot Heat!!!) Planning my 18th! It will be AMAZING! I've already got 120 people on the guest list! can start smoking legally (yay!)Doing the Presidentail classroom in march (yay!) Apps for college due throughout the next couple months (not so yay, but I'm not going to college anyway so it doesn't matter). 
Salsa dance is fun fun fun! Krav Maga has been neglected, must go back, must go back, body falling apart, oh no!
I feel balanced, at peace with the universe (even though Arnold is the govenator which vexes me)I feel good, self esteem has been raised to an all time high, things are good. love politics love journalism, love writing and actually know about all three. YOU SEE,I'M NOT THE FUCKING FAILURE THAT EVERYONE THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE OR AM, AM I? SO FUCK EVERYONE! yay, all better.

I Think it's really important to acknowledge how lucky one is for the people in their lives and the things that they have. And i know that i am a very lucky person.

Tonight was incredible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've met Thom Yorke, but he was piss drunk, it was infront of the Trubado (ya bad spelling) last year on valentines day waiting for Supergrass. They opened tonight. Music has gotten a hold of my soul. I've been bit by the bug, I have fallen in love. 

I have been very in touch with my emotions. I finally can feel myself growing up, it's a bizarre feeling. I feel like I'm older, like I'm not so needy, and not so scared, and I don't feel the need to particularly impress anyone, just to stand up for myself. It's a nice and terrifying feelings all at the same time. 

I was so moved by the stupid cell phone waving of the crowd yesterday, and today, the lighters, just the whole crowd. Not being anyone in particular, just there, i can't really explain, half because it's late, and half because really there is no way to explain.

I'd hate to say that I am confused. But I am. Because I like this grown up I can finally think for myself feeling, and then I think ""oh my god, this is it"" this is the first day of the rest of my life.

Well, I know tomorrow and the rest of the week will be fucking awsome! so I don't really care. I am seeing Radiohead tomorrow night, and I get to interview the lead singer of Hot Hot Heat next week (YAY!!!!!!!) 
So life is good. I happened upon a poem I wrote during the end of the year drama that louis knows about, you do know what I am talking about. Anyway, I happened upon a poem that just, wow, I was wowed. Also my book, unbelievable, page 100 and still going strong! This is good. Anyway, I am going to write my poem that I wrote down here, not, of course, expecting any comments because no one comments, but what ever, i don't need anyones acceptance or praise, i think I am beyond that.
What am I blabbing about? please tell me.


It fills my body
With the silence
Alone
There is no void deeper to fill
With despair we watch
In shame we fall
In deceit we finally break
I am a broken toy
Loved, used and discarded
Forever I am never more then nothing to you
Words cannot describe the pain
Its description will burn the paper bare
Do not document the raw reality of failure and regret
They are the scars across my wrists and neck
That will never heal in the screaming silences of the shame 
All alone
With just the screaming silence
Whispering to me about everything I want to forget

I think it's pretty deep, well the scars run deep yes? yes? I feel SO stupid right now, so stupid, because other people may not learn from their mistakes, but I should! because by saying other people don't I'm being a hypocrite, or maybe I just believe in other people too much. Have I learned? yes. Will I actually not repeat the mistake? probably not. But that's because I'm stupid, fucking fucking stupid.
Whatever, that's it

I am also volunteering for Westey Clark, who will hopefully anounce that he is running for president in the next couple days. Working on an presidency election will be fucking amazing!

I feel so free and so good and I'm onlydoing things that I WANT to be doing, and there's a good chance I won't get that luxury again in a long time if at all again in my life. 
I raelized today how bizarre everything. Since I was young everyone predicted I would be the flighty, floozy girl who was the social butterfly with tons of friends, never staying in one place, having a difficult time commiting and doing everything first, kiss and so on, but not having a focus in life, and not having a sense of myself and not having a path to follow. Looking back at my old old friends, I see that they have all lost their ways in life, goind from boy to boy, not caring about their lives much. Being nonchalant. And I'm thinking, wow, I really did it. I have goals, I know myself better then most 17 year olds, and I feel so good, and so whole. It's beautiful. The world is just sparkling, and I love complaining, but even the trivial things that I like complainging about are just too unimportant to complain about, so I'm just happy, i'm free and i'm happy. And I don't need anyone else and I don't need any drugs and I don't need anyones acceptance or applause, I'm grounded, I'm idealistic and yet realistic. And I'm not trying to make myself sound good, I just realized that I'm really the person that I wanted to become. Whether it will be that way in the future who knows? But right now, right now the SUN IS SHINGING AND EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL. As Oscar Wilde said, Life is too important to take seriously. If we only live one life, make it meaningful and wonderful and live it to the fullest, but for goodness sake, don't take it seriously! Seriously. It's easy to get mad, it's easier to just shrug and so 'okay, if that's what you think'. I'm so happy, so so so so so so so happy. WOW. I've never felt this before. Wow wow wow wow
WOW
okay I'm done.
Spread love and happiness, nothing else ACTUALLY matters, no matter what you think.

"event","I got back from Hong Kong today, funny how it's memory seems to have been only a dream. I loved being away and not needing to care about anyone or anything but myself for once, i guess. not in a selfish way, i brough everyone presents of course, but it was just me and the city and mommy of course but she was a bonus. i loved being with people, and not knowing what in hell they were saying (Loung is dragon in Kantonese if anyone reads this or cares...). I loved being curious and i loved not knowing and having to explore. 
it was cleansing, it was like running away but with strings attached. I didnt need to run away from anything, not really, it was like when i escaped to London two summers ago. I just needed to be away, clear my head, put life into perspective. I have decided to take a year off between high school and college. I really want to travel, the only way to really learn is to meet people, see other cultures, experince other places, other lifestyles. In Hong Kong 
I met a woman who had just gotten back from Lima Peru, she had gone through the Amazon and then went to machu pitchu, I decided that I want to do that. I am going to travel through central and south america, experience the richness of the mexican and arginitinan and chilian (um....) and brazilian cultures. I want to know how they live, what they eat, what they believe. I want to learn their passion and their art work and their dances. My friend Daniel just came back from a 2 month road trip around central america, he took a year off and he's a different person now. In Hong Kong I also met a woman who had spent the last 6 months wandering India. She told me about the people she met, how they wont make the cows move if they are standing in the middle of the road because they believe that the cows are their ancestors, how hospitable the people were. That they barely have anything and yet they are still willing to take a complete stranger into their home for as long as they need and feed them and give them a roof over their head. So i decided that the only way to be a good journalist and photojourlist, if indeed that is what i want to be, even if not, i need to culture myself. I want to go to Africa and work with the AIDS patients there, help them live and help people prevent the spread of the disease, and I want to travel through China, Hong Kong was just an appatizer to wet my desires. I just want to know everything and everyone. 
So i am going to go to Israel and work on a Kibutz (please excuse my hideous spelling) and after that I am going to go around europe and china. then hop over to india for a couple months and then to south america where i will make my way up to north america and back to college. i'm scared though. taking a year off seems so crazy and so shunned I guess. and I'm afraid i'll love it all too much to want to go back to"" reality"" what ever that may be. I dont know the future, 3 weeeks ago i didn't even know I was going to hong kong.
I have to say that after CSPA and Hong Kong, I am a changed person. I was blessed by a Buddhist monk, I ate shark fin and crab feet, and I learned so much about myself. About tolerance, about people, about life and feeling and living. And the real way to live and the real way to learn, at least in my perspective, is to travel, to know other people is to know yourself. How you react and interact in the unfamiliar and strange is the person who you are, not the comfortable person who has the same routine and goes to the same place everyday to do the same boring thing. I've been enlightened, not quite nirvana, but somewhere in that spectrum. I will be 18 in less then 6 months. I still say I am 13, conflict of understanding, conflict of interest. I want to go as much as i want to stay. I am as scared as i am brave. I want to grow up but I want to stay a kid forever. 
it was funny how i was the most corrupt person at CSPA, and i was proud of it, because even though I have done a shit load of crazy, irresponsible, immature, spontaneous (yes yes yes) things, I knew myself so much better becuase of it. I felt more complete, that I understood what and why and what lines to cross and which lines are too thin to dare try and cross over. 

And I know things now, many valuable things, that I hadn't known before, do not put your faith in a cape and a hood they will not protect you the way that they should, and take extra care with strangers even flowers have their dangers and though scary is exciting, nice is different then good.
Now I know don't be scared, granny is right just be prepared, isn't it nice to know alot???? and a little bit not. (to quote none other then little red, into the woods teaches so much more then any bible or study guide could ever try to emulate)."

"event","i'm in SLO at jourmalism camp. I'm having a lot of fun. Right now i feel a little pang right in my heart, it's starting to frustrate me. MAybe i shouldn't read into things so much. I don't know. In the long run does it matter? I guess it does and it doesn't. I have 8 more days here. it's weird because the time is going by both VERY slowly and very fast and i'm not sure which. I wish I was not so paraniod (everybodies coming to get me). I'm on page 45 of the book i'm writing--louis (even though I know you are not reading this) I think you'll actually like it this time, woohoo. Sometimes I just want to kill myself. I shouldn't be so melodramatic-depressed, it's not good for me. oh well, what the hell? right? right. i suppose.
good morning

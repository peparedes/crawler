And to that, I do not care.  But tell me anyway.  Because I do care.  One of the ones which helps me get past <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=11"">Black Blog Blogitty Blog</a> (AKA: The only show worse than cancer) is <a href=""http://pri.morefairgame.org/"">Fair Game</a>.  While, yes, the comedy writing is a bit heavy handed and Leno-esque at moments (it's true, Faith.  Deal.), it sometimes has some brilliant shining moments of brilliancy.  Such as this segment: <a href=""http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/fairgame/.jukebox?action=viewMedia&mediaId=698902"">THIS ONE</a>.  I'd give you a hint as to what it was in order to entice you to listen, but it is much better if you don't know.  So just listen.  What do you have to lose?

Damn, this pledge drive has been wearing on me.  I've decided to give to WNYC because they provide 90% of the podcasts I use to avoid Black Blog Blogitty Blog.  I can't support my local station as long as they continue to broadcast the most racist, shallow and pointless show ever to take to the air during the exact moment in time that I want to listen to the radio.  How bad is it?  Remember when Juan Williams hosted Talk of the Nation?  Those were the good times, my friends.  This show has Juan as a <i>senior news analyst</i>.  He does a superb job of taking a news story and adding nothing to it in any way.  Unfortunately for Juan, I can read headlines on my own, so I still have no use for him.  Oh, awful waste of time and money, if you didn't exist NPR may actually craft a good show that focuses on news from a minority perspective.  Instead, we get Black Blog Blogitty Blog.  The worst show ever."

Well, one of you
Ok, <b>me</b>. I remember.  Hmph.  <b>I</b> remember a few hundred years ago posting a link to an Amazon ad that used a not-thin guy to sell underwear.  Remember now?  He was kinda plump?  Anything?  No, well, anyway, I have found a female model who, while not not-thin, may be the perfect companion for that man.  Meet the <a href=""http://www.razor-gator.com/"">Razor Gator</a>!

Ah yes, the tool for people who, like me, don't like to change blades on their razors and, unlike me, are willing to try to sharpen their razors rather than, like me, run a dull razor over the same patch of irritated skin a billion times every morning (by which I mean, late afternoon).

I love this model.  Her eyes seem to scream ""please don't hit me again."" Her lips seem to say... wait, no lips.  Or hips.  Or knowledge that a camera is pointed at her.

But wait, there's more!  Don't let the section labeled ""Razor Gator Research"" pass you by.  A section that uses technical terms like ""Razor Gunk"" might overwhelm some pedestrian visitors to the site, but not I.  I soldier on!  Like one of those people!  The ones with the guns.  Who have to keep going on?  Lawyers?  Marching on like a, um, band leader? I looked at the data that seems to indicate that use of the Razor Gator can reduce the chance of getting a bacterial infection.  But I ask you this, imaginary opponent: Why would I want to sharpen something that, when able to directly enter my skin, can cause an infection?  Could this be what is afflicting your model?  And why does my keyboard not register every twentieth keystroke or so?  Can you answer me that?  And why is the Gator so damned manual?  Is this not the near future as promised during my parents' childhoods?  Maybe some sort of Razor Roomba that wanders the house looking for things to sharpen is in order.  Maybe it can dance to a song by Spoon.  Maybe it can check a twitter feed and remark to me, on occasion, how it, too, hates the entire notion of Twitter in a dry tone before commenting upon a story it heard on NPR earlier in the day.  Because that, my dear Razor Gator, that would be sweet."

Bringing the party together under one glorious, unified, multi-racial banner for WhuhHUNH?! You mean it isn't over?  You can't actually mean that the advance data and polling, which strongly suggested that Clinton would not be KO'd in Texas or Ohio, was correct?  But all the news media kept saying that this was the last stand!  Like standing at that car rental place that tries harder!  And we all know how that turned out for Johnny Appleseed and his Band of Married Men!!  And the media kept quoting, in dire tones, that even Mr. Former President Clinton acknowledged that this was do or die WHICH ALWAYS MEANS DIE!!

Speaking of Die, including the 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 20-sided varieties, along with the ""death"" type of die, nearly ironically, as well.  J. Jonah Peterson, the co-inventor (but totally the one who came up with all the good stuff) of Mongols and Maps died at the tender age of 53+2d20 years.  He will be with us in our hearts forever, unless someone should raise him from the dead, in which case he will lose a level and, soon after, reach ""venerable"" age-- considering the stat loss would be a total of 6 to Str, Dex and Con, perhaps he should consider remaining in the grave and just rolling up a new character.

Speaking of segways, I love this:

You've transgressed (or, rather, I'VE transgressed) and you don't know how to go about sticking your head back out and apologizing and starting again without seeming like a liar and a person who is full of himself and without trying to be the abuser who says, ""no, really, it won't ever happen again this time,"" and you want to mean it but you know you probably can't live up to it.  You can't really go back to the way things were and real life will take hold and you'll have to do some laundry and before you know it you'll be mowing the lawn again.  By which I mean I'll be mowing the lawn again.  It's an electric mower I got from amazon.  They should watch it with that free shipping crap.  Anyway, wishing you were still in touch with your online friends.  Wishing you knew where everyone was and what they were doing and not sure how to ask or if you even want to know.  I mean, in my head Leo and Shauna moved to Cali and have become fabulously happy and successful and yet Lil' Mussolini is only 2 and is still irrepressibly adorable.  Do I want to tamper with that?  How could I?  A few months back Whittlz messed with my image of her.  She left NYC for Cali?  Who would believe that?  Who would believe that my Lizzie and I are still together and still super happy with each other.  We own a home.  I added <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/aandyd/Kittens/photo#5085299262897140994"">my own beautiful kitten</a> to her collection of two cats.  My kitten's name is Boxcar Credenza.  You know, Boxcar to recognize the hobo side, Credenza 'cause she's fancy like that.  Who could believe that shit?  I own a Zune.  It's friggin' awesome!  Who knew?

I guess what finally brings me back.  What has finally forced my hand.  It's a job change.  The place I've been at for 6 years is making me sick.  I've fought the war for food quality and lost.  Wednesday night we did a meatloaf special and I nearly cried.  I came in an hour before the special was to kick off and everything was already cooked.  The meatloaf looked like someone took a dump on a tray.  It had been sitting off to the side for over an hour.  Most certainly not food safe.  The gravy was from a powder.  The mashed potato was from a bag, and amazingly gluey.  The green beans.  My god.  They were frozen, then boiled with bacon and ham.  My parents are from the South.  They don't quite get the difference between oil soluble and water soluble compounds, but they don't own a restaurant.  I can understand their bad taste.  I'm depressed with this shit.  The owner thinks it is top notch.  Yum!  I can't even begin to express myself to her.  Look, I know YOU like it, but this food is not worth eating.  Says the employee to the boss.  She loves it.  Sycophants love it.  Meanwhile...

I might be buying a used book store.  A profitable one at that.  $50k for an easy million in inventory.  The current owner didn't really want to be in the business.  A stamp guy, to be honest.  It's complicated.  The store pulls in tons of profit (Half.com, amazon and eBay.  Hooray technology!), but it is all a bit outside of my expertise.  We'll see.

I hope you have all been well.  And I hope El' Duce hasn't aged.

Yes, he decided what Cuban exiles should do should Castro die and have his government overthrown by the existing Cuban population.  They should wait until the new Cuban democracy settles in before taking any action, of course.  The exiles are not happy with Bush's imaginary potential future Cuban government's plans and have decided not to wait until this non-existent government settles in, declaring that they will seek to resolve their property rights claims with the as-yet-only-existing-on-bar-napkins government the instant it magically takes control of the current chock-full-of-Castro government.  Democrats considered taking the entirely speculative position of supporting the exiles' dreamlike stance, but were afraid of having to actually back that position sometime in the vast and indeterminate future.  Meanwhile, Ralph Nader has declared that he is working on a plan of action should Galactus attack."

What I need to say is this: This Bush imigration plan is fucked up. So, say you're Mexican, and the imigration policy isn't letting you in.  Your skills aren't what this country says it is looking for.  So you sneak in.  Now, under the Bush plan, all you have to do is pay a fine (okay), pay taxes (okay), prove that you've worked here a number of years (okay) and now you can get in line behind the other people who don't have the skills this country says it is looking for.  What?  Jump through hoops to wind up where you fucking started?!  That's craaaaazzzzz.... oh, wait, no... that's Bush.  

So let's back the fuck up.  All the way up.  All the way to my ancestors.  My folks (or, at least, most of my folks) came here as indentured servants.  Dig it?  Anybody see the connection?  They did manual labor for a few years to earn their place in society.  They worked to pay off their masters and that was that.  Here we are in 2006, long past the days of slavery, and we can't even live up to the barbaric practices of our ancestors?  Shame on us all."

I've got SAD!  No, Leo, wait... it's not seasonal affectation disability.  Put down the rifle and back up.  It's Severe Anxiety Disorder aka Social Anxiety Disorder aka Social Phobia aka Loner Frightenillus aka Nuts.  I wasn't told if I want to kill my mother and sleep with my father or anything, but I was given three prescriptions, so I think that means that I win.  I mean, three drugs?  In your face, drugless losers.  You think you can take me on?  I've got three lines of scrawl here that says you don't stand a chance.

Anyway, the long and short of it is that I'm not just shy, I'm abnormally shy.  Shyness leads to depression which leads to fear which slides over to hate and buys it a drink and the next thing you know you're holding the limbo stick with the dark side.  So, one pill is for the shyness and depression.  It's only too bad that it is in short supply and the pharmacist told me that they hope they can get some in tomorrow.  One pill is so I can get my sleep thingy back in whatsis.  I've only been able to sleep for 4 hours at a time for the last week.  I keep waking up way too early, feeling fully refreshed for all of, say, 3 hours, then needing more sleep.  Pill number three is my emergency ""the walls are closing in"" pill.  I think it's cyanide.  Or LSD.  Not really sure, but I know that it will keep me from disclosing the location of the microfilm to the Ruskies.

So, tonight I'll be able to sleep.  Tomorrow maybe I'll be able to decrease my level of general craziness.  By Friday I should be back to building a satellite system that will redirect subs out of International waters."

"event","And blind.  So very very blind.  No, my problems are still very real.  But, hey, so there is this thing called a psychotologist or something-- which is a person who fixes brainurisms?  Anyway, yeah, gonna go see one or more of them.  And a doctor doctor.

I'd thought of doing the psychologist thing earlier, but only long enough to go, ""not for me.""  See, I've got some problems with the mental health field.  I was raised in a family that is very rub-some-dirt-in-it-and-walk-it-off.  Also, they believe in the power of prayer.  Got a problem?  Get over it or pray.  While I've certainly dropped the latter, I still stick to the former like glue.  Also, I like science.  Ok, I love science.  And while the mental health pharmaceutical industry is chock full of good hard science, the mental health professionals I'd be dealing with do not operate on it themselves.  Finally, my brother gets therapy and whatnot and it is hard for me to do it and not feel like I'm infringing on his pain, somehow.  You know my brother, right?  He's the one who spent the first 3-4 months of his son's 6 month life trying to go through bootcamp on crutches (again and again).  He's the one who got his wife a job with the same company he worked for, got a promotion and they extended it to her as well because of the relocation involved, they both relocated and then she left him 2 months later for their new best friend, who also works with him.  Oh, and she dropped the bomb when my brother had just returned home from our grandmother's funeral.  So, yeah, it's hard for me to go ""Oh, I need a braintologist too!!""  Because, even though we are very much strangers to each other these days, I really respect my brother and wouldn't want to do anything that would... I don't know.  It's stupid, but I kinda feel like I'm an asshole for wanting a mindopractor as well, considering what he's been through.

So, the move is off for one year, at least.  It would be really really stupid for me to move while I have untreated mental problems.  Damned dangerous, too.  Now the problem is that I want New York.  I want that baby bad.  I got it so firmly set in my head that now I can't <i>not</i> go.  So, I will take my first actual vacation in 15 years this summer and hell or high water, I'm going to New York City."

This is mainly a note for Leo (and Jeff, if Jeff is still out here.  Hi Jeff!  I don't have your post-domain surrender email addy).  The LJ community <lj user=""ljrpg""> has kicked off a new campaign.  Of course, they picked a campaign that is doomed to completely fall apart.  That's right, the World's Largest Dungeon.  While rpgmp3.com has done very very well at sticking with this book, I doubt that this will go very far in the LJ universe.  ""Thuggo, I'll bait it, you jump it from behind."" ""Sounds like a plan"" (one week later) ""Thuggo?""  ""Thuggo deleted his account.""  ""Fuck!"".  Rpgmp3 has the benefit of having a limited number of players, and all of them are people that have played together for quite a long time.  Also, the gm made the decision to not draw out every room, whereas the gm of ljrpg must type out the room description of every room, and track, what, 8 characters?  Craxy.  But I'd still like to play.

Also, I keep seeing ljrpg as lrpg, and it makes me laugh to consider people trying to lrpg via text.  ""Lightning bolt! Lightning bolt! Lightning bolt!"" ""You only get one action this round!"" ""Round?  We have rounds?"" ""I jump over the table and drive my sword through the dragon's head."" ""Yes, we have rounds.  I don't know if you can do that, Ted.""  ""SIR DROMICULOUS!

"event","So, long story short, maybe this is part of the reason red states have higher abortion rates.

Short story long, I've been buying some pretty cool crap lately.  I guess I'm doing some mid-life-not-quite-a-crisis shopping, probably in the hope that I won't make it to 60, but then I look at the pretty cool crap and realize that my mlnqac shopping is pretty fucking nerdy.  I mean, come on Andy, I'm supposed to buy a sports car and develop a taste for hookers and blow, not buy the Sims 2 expansions, some computer upgrades and new tv antennas.  

Of course, now that I've got those expansions I can buy sports cars for all my Sims, which makes it a fact that tiny fake people who say, ""Mischa Na,"" before peeing on the carpet are living it up better than I am.  The new antennas, fairly nice set-top bunny ears, means that I can watch more shows about hookers and blow without adjusting the old antennas, which were bunny ears without a stand so I had them dangling from a hook.  The new crap for the PC -- Now we're talking.  I've got a tv-tuner card so I can watch and tape shows about hookers and blow on my tv OR my computer.  It's practically like having a robot butler!  AND, since my old totally awesome video card gave up the ghost, I got a new more totally awesomer video card and a new power supply because the old one wasn't pushing enough power to handle the new card.  YEAH!  AND it is so totally shiny!  FUCKYEAH!

So, after a night of medium-style drinking, I decide to install all this shit (except for the expansions, yo, I been playin' dem fo WEEKS!) and a wireless card I had laying around.  You may be saying to yourself, that there sounds like an idear that is nothing but trouble.  Shut up, cowboy, I don't go to where you ride horses and slap the dick out of your mouth and then suck that dick and leave my wife hanging with nary a dick to suck, now, do I?  It all came together without a hitch.  I mean, of course there was the requisite MOTHERFUCKERs yelled when I kept dropping those tiny damned screws over and over and over and the more exasperated MOTHER FUCK ERs cried out as I searched the ground for said screws, but these things are <u>required</u>.  That's why <u>they direct you to do so in the manual</u>!  It's the ability to curse properly that separates the Professor Frinks from the Doctor Nicks of the world.

So, it's all running.  It's all wonderful.  The tv tuner card is so cool.  I had it autoscan for channels a la your typical VCR, and it did it lightning fast and found all kinds of channels I didn't really realize I could get.  2 of these channels are very religious in nature.  One of these religious channels drew me in with a children's show that was so unfuckinbelievably bad.  And this is the story of that show.

It's Barney, only the dinosaurs are green (and some pink and blue ones).  No, it is not live-action Dragon Tales, it's just ripping off dragon tales and throwing ILOVEJESUS in at odd moments.  Rather than a big cast of kids to sing and dance with the people dressed up as scientifically and anatomically incorrect dinosaurs (or Jesusaurs or something), they just have two big-eyed waspy girls and a series of cameos by super-square adults who pop in to move the plot forward and/or remind us of God's love.  

So, here is the story in today's show.  One of the wasps, we'll call her Jizzim, just found out that mom is knocked up.  Jizzim is feeling pretty low.  ""I'm used to being the center of their love and now I won't be!""  So the dinos sing and dance for her (she immediately starts dancing with them, so it is debatable just how depressed she really was).  The song is, basically, ""BABIES ARE GREAT!""  Yes, the dinos cheer Jizzim out of her there-is-a-baby-on-the-way-depression by telling her how great babies are.  The song wasn't religious in any way, so they used a crowbar to wedge Jesus into it.  At two different parts the tempo changes, the key changes, the dancing stops and they sing ""AND JEEE EEEE SUS WILL SHOW THE WAAAAAY!"" even though there was no context for it.  Really, it went, like, ""Babies are great!  Babies are cute!  Babies are great!  Babies are fun!  AND JEEE EEEE SUS WILL SHOW THE WAAAAAY!""  SHOW THE WAY TOFUCKINGWHAT?!  Jesus will show us that babies are great?  Pardon me, but I don't think he spent much time telling us how to go about accepting how great babies are.  ""Peter, you will deny me three times..."" ""I won't, my Lord!"" ""...but you can not deny how great babies are."" ""True that."" ""Double true.""

So, bam, problem solved.  I'm sad about a baby coming.  Babies are great.  Wow, I'm not sad that a baby is coming anymore!  Then some stick-up-her-ass mother type drops by with a stroller full of 5-pound flour bags dressed up as babies and hands them out to everyone to take care of ""because the flour weighs the same as a baby.""  FEED YOUR FUCKING CHILDREN, LADY!!!  5 POUNDS!!!  CHRIST!  The lesson we learn from the flour experiment?  Even mildly retarded people in dinosaur costumes can take care of a baby.  And if you have a problem, just send out a little prayer to your old buddy Jesus.  My computer did not lock up at this point, but I sure did.

Happy Saturday everybody!"

"event","Ok, I'll give you birds, no need to argue it.  They have a 91% monogamy rate, and while I won't claim that this is a sign of them doing it, or even having the ability to do it, or that it exists in the first place, I will admit that this at least casts a fairly convincing image of them doing it and if I was to argue against this image it would be far too time consuming.  So I'll let you have birds, just know that I am still mocking you for it in my mind.  

Bees, most certainly, do not do it.  Insects simply do not do it.  Many bees do not even have sex at all and the queen, well, let's just say that the queen is a slut.  Hell, at birth the queen goes around killing her sisters before setting up for a life of screwing.  What does she think about her many lovers?  Well, they're her own children.  Her own children!  No, my friend, bees do not do it.  The sick bastards.

Fleas, no matter their level of education, do not do it.  They're insects.  Insects never do it.  Not even the ones who die due to having sex or die soon after.  Insects just lack emotion.  They are sociopaths.  Stop pretending that they can do it.

Yes, the Spaniards do it, and it isn't limited to the rich.  I mean, this is assuming anyone ever really does it.  Doing it may be a construct of the human imagination.  Do we have anything other than anecdotal evidence that it can be done?  But, if it can be done, the Spaniards can do it.  As can the Lithuanians.  But the Letts?  Who are you talking about here?  Letts is a common British surname, sure, but I don't think that it is proper to go throwing them in amongst the birds bees and fleas.  Yes, ok, the Dutch, the Finns and the Siamese do it too.  Ok, and Argentinians and people in Boston, too.  Christ.  Now, if you'll stop naming nationalities and get back to the premise of your argument.

Sponges?!  Are you out of your freaking mind?  First, there are no romantic sponges other than, say, the ones found in the bathtubs of people (or, say, the ones designed for insertion into people).  Those sponges are not alive!  Many of those sponges never were alive!  Sponges, alive or dead, do not do it.  They lack nerves, internal organs and muscles.  They don't even make contact with each other to reproduce sexually, and you think they do it?  You're clearly out of your mind.

Oysters do not do it.  You're being silly.  They don't make contact while reproducing.  They don't even get to know each other or their children.  They are loners who do not do it.  No, not clams, either, or jellyfish or electric eels or soles or goldfish.  You're just being childish."

"event","So, I watched the first few episodes of this show back in the day, but was like, ""Meh,"" because it failed to hold my attention, unlike my fat hard cock.  So, last night I taped an episode and am watching it now.  The difference is, this time I'm blown away by the fact that Dr. House is Hugh Laurie.  Last time I was watching the show I didn't make the connection between Dr. House being played by Hugh Laurie while looking exactly like Hugh Laurie and Hugh Laurie himself.  I'd like to say it was the medication I was on* or the accent Hugh uses or the fact that I am totally retarded but, really, I have no excuse for not realizing that Hugh Laurie was, in fact, Hugh Laurie.  Maybe I should talk to a fake doctor about this.

So, tonight's show.... fucking incredibly horrible does not begin to describe how bad the writing is.  Nearly as bad as Gilmore Girls?  Yeah, that's much closer to the mark.  It's bad.  Not one person has a single human line.  It's all, ""Platitude,"" ""Platitude,"" ""Platitude?"" ""Platitude!"" ""Joint platitude.""  Honestly, the dialogue is on par with your average AOL ad.  Spyware is bad.  How can I stop spyware?  AOL.  I will get AOL.  AOL is super nice.  Will it make me l33t?  D00d, yeah.  Nifty!  Also, I love that this hospital puts 7 doctors on every case.  Will I tape another episode?  Not likely.  Not unless I hear that the writers have been shot.  Out of cannons.  Into the writers of Gilmore Girls.

"event","So, after work tonight I decided to go out for a few drinks.  So, I'm plastered right now!  Or not.  Anyway, I'm doing my usual thing where I make eyes at some nice lady somewhere in the room and compose, in my head, a personals ad.  It would go along the lines of: SWM, 29, seeks woman who is smarter than him.  And then it would go on to identify my faults and strengths, focusing on my faults but with the occasional fault turned strength spin... like ""brutally honest""... sure, you want that until I tell you that that dress does, in fact, make you look fat and I start in on how your best friend should be the first to die when the revolution comes.  Eventually, the girl I was making eyes at leaves and sometime after that I move to a table near a hot chick that I am now making eyes at.  But she's talking to this feller and she's bringing up security clearances and contracts and how she can help this guy in the job that he's in because she has contacts that can get shit done.  

So, now I'm not making eyes at her but rather, I'm making ears at her.  Turns out, she works for Senator Jim ""FUCKING ASHCROFT JUNIOR"" Talent.  That's right, Satan hisself (next to, say, Kit Bond and Dubya).  She informs the guy that Talent isn't what the guy thinks he is.  That Talent is a stand-up guy, true-blue, a real 'merican and whatnot.  Oh really?  Then she goes on to say that ""Every Democrat out there was in favor of this war, and now they're using opposition for the war for political gain.""  Hot or not, this chick just bought herself a reaming.  So, I lean over and tear into her about how only the Senate Dems voted for it, and not ""all"" of them and how the vote wasn't to go to war, but to give the President power to go to war with Iraq should he need it.  How it was a vote designed to give Bush's non-stop saber-rattling some authority so that war could actually be prevented and how Bush misused that authority to stage a ""pre-emptive"" war that did not pre-empt anything because nothing was being planned against us.  And and and, well, I guess I should tell you that I'm usually a very quiet person.  Extremely quite and shy.  But there is a certain point, after just the right number of beers, where the mind and the mouth act in such accord that I could possibly cripple you with it... well, let's just say, she was announcing what a great guy Jim ""FUCKING ASHCROFT JUNIOR!!!"" Talent is when I hit this point, and I didn't stop where I stopped above.  I didn't even stop within five minutes of where I stopped above.   By the end I was leaning over her, nose to nose and, using every expletive at my disposal*, told her where she could shove her Nazi-ass hero Jim ""FUCKING ASHCROFT JUNIOR!!!!!"" Talent and his mom and apple pie belief system.  She grabbed her purse and ran out the door.

On my way home, I couldn't stop giggling.  How should I allude to this penchant for rare unrestrainable ranting in the personal ad?  ""May go nuts when confronted with the devil's agents""?  ""Will make your homo-hating mom cry""?  ""Prone to possession by Malcolm X's pissed off ghost""?

"event","Well, it's been a quiet day in Chanhassen.  It snowed.  The snow seems to go with the frigid weather.  Who'd have thunk it?  Went to the supermarket.  I'm a little disturbed by the fact that I can't seem to find any regional food.  Like, in Lewville we have so much regional food that it becomes a bit mock-worthy.  Yes, we fry ravioli.  Yes, we have a sandwich named after St. Paul that nobody in St. Paul has ever heard of or would ever eat, made of fried egg foo young.  Yes, we use parts of the pig best left on the pig.  Yes, we have brain sandwiches, slingers and square pizza that frightens non-natives.  But Chicago has its deep dish and hotdogs, New York has its cheesecake, grease pizza and dirty-water hotdogs, Philly has the Philly beef, Boston has beans, chowder and tea in the harbor, and California has Mexican food made by real illegals.  So, what about Minnesota?  Where is the moose pizza?  Where is the sweet and sour caribou?  Where are the... snow cones?  Not here.  And no, ""hot dish"" is not a regional thing.  There isn't a place in this country that doesn't have pot luck, the rest of the country just has better things to do than to celebrate it.

This town looks, from what I've seen, very new.  Like, suburb style newness.  I'm sure that there is a history to this town, somewhere, but it seems to have been replaced by strip malls, big box stores and billboards for crap that you can find in the absolutely horrifying Mall of America.  It's so new and clean that all regional food has been swept away in favor of Applebees and TGI Fridays, perhaps?  I don't know.  All I know is that I want to eat some moose and caribou and otter and rhino and whatever else they can grab, roast and throw onto a plate and I can't find any.  

Also, I can't quite understand how the Twin Cities managed to get so big.  What is it that draws people to this wasteland.  How can it bring in so much corporate cash?  It sits out here in the middle of nowhere, up near Canada's middle of nowhere, freezing cold and succeeding nicely.  How can this town be doing so well while St. Louis sits in the shitter?  My theory?  I'm gonna say liberal white flight-- white folks didn't want to look like racists when they decided to move out of the real urban cities, so they built themselves a little honky fake-urban mecca up here where black folks are too smart to come.  I say ""fake-urban"" because every street feels like it's in a suburb.  In fact, it's all very Chicago-suburb.  So suburban, in fact, that we drove through both of the twin cities to the suburbs without noticing a difference at all.  What's up with that?

Gotta go get some beer in me.  Where the women are strong, the women are hot and the children are forgotten.  I hope."

"event","So, here I am, writing from the confines of Minneapolis/St. Paul Corporo-poofter Inn.  My parents thought it would be a good idea to put me up here.  The place kinda has a warmed over Martha Stewart feel.  All of the rooms are named after towns.  Mine is called Deadwood, go figure.  Now, normally I'd be thrilled to be staying in the Deadwood suite, right?  But, get this, the Deadwood suite is nonsmoking.  Also, the bar is closed tonight and I can't find a whore or a game of Faro anywhere.  I'm going to have to call shenanigans.  Shenanigans!

Also, as one may expect from a place this close to Canada, it is cold here.  Which makes me wonder why I didn't bring a heavy coat.  Or any coat.  Or a jacket.  I've got a hoodie.  Granted, it is a Transom.org hoodie which, just last night, did not rip when I tripped up my own damn front steps -- something that can not be said for the jeans I was wearing, or the skin under those jeans, or the skin under the hoodie.  So, it would be reasonable to assume that this hoodie has some sort of public radio based super powers.  I mean, that's what I assumed, anyway.  Even though, as of yet, it has only demonstrated its abilities to be quite free and to avoid sustaining damage, while passing that damage along to its wearer.  Which would put it on the same level as, say, Henry Pym and Jubilee.

On the bright side, I did discover that my parents have found a new way to destroy turkey.  Usually, it's the old 6-8 hour baking followed by the now-dry meat being ripped from the carcass by hand.  This time the turkey was over-cooked the day before, refrigerated, sliced and re-heated.

So, I'm thankful for my new laptop, wireless access and ventilation fans in hotel bathrooms.  Smokefree Deadwood, my ass."

"event","I've done some checking into the French porn.  I believe I downloaded it because, while cruising around random blogs three weeks back, I found a director that listed this film as an inspiration.  I like film, so I did a ed2k search and started downloading it before forgetting all about it.  As I said, I've done some research on it.  I figured I might as well find out exactly what will be haunting my nightmares for years to come.

The movie is called ""The Anatomy of Hell"" (roughly translated, I suppose).  According to some trustworthy folks, Rhonda and Jed (real character names: <i>Woman</i> and <i>Man</i>... mine are better) are not a couple.  They had just met at the gay club.  Jed is gay.  Rhonda (slashed wrist is still a mystery) pays Jed to watch her for four nights.  Ok, let me step in to point out that, apparently, the woman who directed this movie doesn't exactly believe in sexual identifications.  From what I can tell, she thinks gay men, or at least Jed, are gay not because they want to fuck boys, but because they despise lady parts.  O.... kay.  I have never met a gay man who wasn't absolutely facinated by lady parts, that I know of, but maybe France is dif'rent.  Rhonda is like the director.  Rhonda wants Jed to confront lady parts in all their glory and bloody gory to see if he won't come to love the lady parts the way she loves lady parts.  The ocean is supposed to represent womanish womeness.  The blood is all that great stuff probably mentioned in the bagina monologues-- bleeding without a wound or violence... blood of life... beverage cart of destiny.  So, all of Rhonda's long assed nude monologues are just poetic pussy comments.  Watching it, I caught all kinds of art film mainstays (cuts to waves crashing, odd overhead shots of people moving through crowds, liquid running, dripping, garden implements in hoohas... really, the only thing it was missing was the <a href=""http://homestarrunner.com/expfilm.html"" target=""_blank"">swinging lightbulb</a>.), so, much of it makes sense in that ""Oh, I see what you were trying to do"" sort of way, but certainly followed by ""burn this and start over in a way that isn't totally creepy and gross and makes me not want to live, Lady Parts Girl.""

So, it is an art film, not porn.  Only, it contains boobies and dingles and hoohas and those things meeting up in various configurations and Jed is played by a PORN STAR.  So, it is porn.  High porn.  The type of porn that sends you to the bathroom to vomit rather than to stroke the dingle.  Like I said, never watch French porn.  I'll recap some American porn sometime in the future.  Nice, cleansing, American 70's porn."

"event","Never, and I mean Never, watch French porn.  I'm not even sure how I downloadered it.  Fake persona not withstanding, I'm not much of porn guy.  I don't go out looking for porn, that way I'm always surprised by, say, the presence of boobies or hoohas.  But this was porn.  In a way.  French porn.  Let me break it down for you.  (I don't speak French, so I will name the main guy ""Jed"" and we'll call the girl ""Rhonda"")

<lj-cut text=""Porn break down (no pictures (thank God))"">
1: Jed and Rhonda are at a gay club.  Techno.  Jed is dancing with a guy.  Jed kisses the guy and then goes over and kisses Rhonda.  Then he heads to the bathroom(?).  Rhonda goes upstairs and slashes her wrist.

2: Walgreens (not really, but some sort of pharmacy-type place).  A doctor finishes bandaging Rhonda's wrist.  Jed stands by the cash register looking pissed off.  They leave.  Rhonda starts into a long monologue.  Jed slaps her.  Rhonda runs down some stairs.  Jed walks down them.  They meet up at the bottom and continue walking.  They have some sort of exchange and Rhonda performs some oral sex on him.  He gets off in less than 20 seconds.

3: The next night.  Jed gets out of a cab and heads into Rhonda's house.  He looks so pissed off.  He comes in and Rhonda uses the toilet.  They talk a bit and then Rhonda goes into a really long monologue while taking off her clothes and getting onto her bed.  Jed is still looking all pissed off.  They talk and talk and then there is a flashback to Jed as a child.  He's all dirty.  He climbs a tree and opens a box of grubs.  Then he scoots up to a nest and feeds a grub to a baby bird.  Then he tries to feed a grub to another baby bird, but it doesn't seem to be interested.  He puts the bird in his shirt pocket and climbs out of the tree.  On reaching the ground he notices a bloody spot on his shirt.  He pulls out the bird.  Dead.  So he throws it on the ground and stomps it to pieces.  End flashback.  Jed, still looking pissed, goes out for a smoke.  We watch him smoke at the top of a cliff by the ocean for, like, 5 minutes.  Still all pissed off.  Then he goes inside to find Rhonda sleeping.  He gets some lipstick from the bathroom and comes back.  He draws all over her hooha and then puts some on her face-lips.  Then he strips down and has sex with her.  Another 20 seconds.  He still looks pissed off.  Then he cries.  She consoles him.

4: Rhonda is taking a pee.  Jed shows up, Rhonda answers the door in a nice dress.  Jed takes off Rhonda's dress and wanders down to the kitchen.  Flashback to Rhonda as a kid.  She is carving a walking stick and three boys run up and push her while laughing.  She lays down and scoots into a bush and pulls off her panties to give the boys a look.  One of them pulls off another boy's glasses and reaches into the bush.  The earpiece comes back wet.  End flashback.  Jed comes back with a bottle of whiskey and a glass.  Rhonda is sleeping on the bed.  He sits and drinks for a long time.  Then Jed comes over and fingers her.  Apparently she is menstruating.  Jed goes outside and fishes around in the dark for something.  He comes back to the bedroom with hoe in hand.  It looks like he is going to kill her.  He turns the hoe around and places its handle into her hooha and goes back to his drinkin' and glarin' chair.  Rhonda wakes to find hoe in hooha and Jed long gone.

5: Jed is sitting naked with Rhonda, who is, of course, naked again (still?).  They talk and then Rhonda pulls out her tampon and dunks it in a water glass.  They both drink the bloody water.  Rhonda goes into a long monologue as she opens and puts in a fresh tampon.

6: Rhonda is naked on the bed again.  Jed comes over and Rhonda grabs him and pulls him into the bed.  He tears off his clothes and has 40 seconds of sex with her.  On pulling out, he is covered with blood.  They cry for a few minutes.  Then Rhonda gets up and delivers a long monologue while blood runs down her leg.  Jed goes down to the pub to have a drink.

7: At the pub.  Jed has a long talk with an old guy.  Jed cries.  Jed gives the old guy all of his money.

8: At the pub.  Somebody is setting up chairs as Jed wakes up on the sidewalk outside by the window.  Jed walks away.  Jed walks along the rocky coastline.  He goes into Rhonda's house and finds that Rhonda and all of her stuff is gone.  On the bedframe rests the hoe and a blood-stained sheet.  Jed cradles the sheet and cries.  He walks outside to find Rhonda by the cliff.  He walks over and pushes her off the cliff.  Then he stands and watches the waves.  Roll credits.

Carville: Well, David, not all pundits are willing to roll over for the Republican agenda like you...
Broder: Fuck this fucking fucktown!!!
Ed Henry: What do you think about pasta?

Carville: Pasta is good...
[Broder pulls out a handgun and checks the safety]
Carville: I like it when it is slightly chewy...
[Broder puts the gun in his own mouth and fires]
Carville: and just smothered in sauce.
Ed Henry: We have some breaking news about David Broder...
Carville: I just talked to the guy today, he seemed fine?
Ed Henry: Apparently he has died.  Experts on the scene say it may have been a stroke.

"event","You didn't even know I was gone!?  Yeah, one of the benefits/drawbacks (circle one) of not updating often is that nobody notices when you lose your DSL for 4 days.  One of the benefits/drawbacks (circle one) of being me is that nobody would care if I never posted again.  Now wipe those damn circles off your screen before your boss walks by, slacker.

Also!  I had sex! (yay!) With a woman! (yay!) In a dream! (yay!)  And, actually, not even the dream happened! (yay!)  Because I'm a fibber! (huzzah!)

Shoot me! (yay!)"

This child was born during a massive heat lightening storm. Some of the sickest lightening I may have ever seen. On the way to the hospital I was clocking the larger episodes to try and further prove that this child will most likely be at least somewhat responsible for the apocalypse if Rob's genes have anything to do with it.

I have no photos yet, but I'm sure some will surface soon.

"event","Listen, kids.
Here is my rocker. I am 10 feet away.

I am hopped up of sleeping pills and insanity, I tell you!

And with this tip-a-tap typing I'm trying to find some calm release of some sort. I was in the middle of finishing filling out this application for this non-profit organization appreticeship Tamsyn showed me...and for some reason it just got so hard. As for the essay I'm supposed to write, that laptops been open for almost 4 hours ,and, technically, I started filling out the app. some time yesterday.
I hit a wall. Hard. With my head. There should be nothing hard about this. I'm actually really excited about every aspect of it. Even the essay. I haven't had the chance to write one in ...years. And really, there isn't hard. I think I just prob shouldn't have taken the sleeping pills till I was done. 
Anyways. Kids.
(SegWAAAY)
I thought you may all be interested in knowing:
<b>Riley Marie Angelico was born at 7:56AM on Weds. morning, May 30th at St. Rapheals Hospital in New Haven, CT. 
It's official. Brian is now a dad and Julia now a mom.</b>
And also, I can see you've noticed...after all the years we've known Brian Hopwood, man, I can remember us being like 14 and he was talking about changing his last name to his mothers...well, with the baby and all, he finally did it not long ago so the baby could be born with the name too.
Now, I....I was graced with the opportunity to actually experience child birth...from a spectators point obviously. The whole. Thing.
I told Brian that when it came time I would be at the hospital with him as support for such a huge, life changing staple in his exisitence. 
Julia was keeping me updated with everything. She had called me the night before to tell me to watch my phone because she was starting to have contractions.
The next afternoon while I was actually at Bridgeport hospital visiting Cristina's mom, I got a call from Brian that Julia's water done breakith. Cristina and her mom both assured me that there was no serious rush and that she had some time to go still considering all the details.
So soon after I made my way from Bridgeport Hospital to St. Rapheals Hospital in New Haven.
Now, I had always assumed that most of my time would be in the hospital waiting room because I know hospitals can get all restrictive with who can be in a room when someone may be having a baby or breeds of livestock.
Even if I was in the room, when she actually started going into full labor, I would be asked to leave...this was not the case. Brian said they're cool like that over at St. Rapheals (which I most likely have been spelling wrong this entire time. Not. Caring.)
I got in at about 9pm Tues. night. Niether of their parents could make it, so it ended up just being me then soon after 2 of Julia's sisters. 
I had no concept of how quickly or not a baby can happen. I knew nothing of nothing as far as timelines and contractions go. We all were just hanging out in the room while Julia had contraction after contraction. Pretending to watch tv, chatting with the midwife. And there's nothing you can really do. I couldn't really hold her hand because what I did not know previously is that you're not supposed to squeeze or tense up during a contraction. I know! You see it all the time on tv! Squeezing someones hand, throwing things. No, not supposed to happen. When you tense or squeeze during a contraction it will stop the contraction short and you don't want that to happen cause then you wouldn't make any progress. You're supposed to just breathe and relax and let it happen cause that slowly moves the baby down, that's what it's supposed to do. It was pretty obvious, but I guess I just never thought about that.
Anyways. I'll spare the details for the most part, but that baby was pushing at a turtle's pace it seemed. If labor technically counts when the contractions started, then Julia was in labor for like 30 something hours. The actual pushing didn't start till about 5am the next day.
At 7:56am all of us (especially Julia) with no sleep...that little (BIG) baby made her appearance. 8lbs 4 ons.
To say it was amazing would be an insult. There shouldn't even be words for moments like it.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a little dirt in my sleepy eyes.
One of the first things Brian said as they put Riley on the table was ""Oh my god, she has my feet!""...and shoves his hand in his mouth. Oh, and it's true. When we were younger I used to always tell Brian that he had tree-climbing toes. We all know Brian's feet. His toes end halfway down his foot and they're the size of my fingers. This baby, fresh out the womb has long, fat baby toes. It's crazy!
She has Julia's nose and mouth. 
This baby is most likely going to be tall, half-asian and gorgeous.
Brian will most likely have lost all his hair by the day she hits 15. Not due to his age, but hers.
The end.

Ok, so now I'm freaking out less and being tired more. Tis 6am and I got shit to do today.
Everything will be great. Everything will be grand. 
I will finish my application & essay tomorrow.
I will fax them.
I will further persue a bicycle in Branford.
I will finally put in the rest of the vegitables I bought in the garden.
I will make a screen for the sugar snap peas to climb.
I will not be upset if I find the weather will not permit for me to be in a kayak this weekend.
I will understand that if not this weekend, some time soon it will happen. I need a vacation. need a vacation.need a vacation.need a vacation.need a vacation.need a vacation.


I'm a driver, I'm a winner. Things are gonna change...I can feel it.

Well...this is the best I can do right now. I completely was going to put my all into this, but by the time I finished puttsing around on other sites, my sleeping pill has now kicked in.

Anyways, here's the skinny.

It's a been a while. I breathe, among other things.

Screw it, BABIES! EVERYONE! STOP HAVING THEM!! YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL OLD!! ER!!!

I had to get that out of my system in some way.

So....I'm breathing. Stuffs been...less than desirable past couple months, but really, I can't complain and I've got plenty of good news too.

Remember that oil drum I painted and mod podged that was supposed to be a trash can for Bridgeport like forever ago? The one from old comic books, skylines of 4 cities made from only the cut black ink sections of comic pages?
Well...this one:

Those are the 4 cities: I believe in goes in the order of: Bridgeport, Los Angeles, Boston, Austin.

More photos of it being made...here:
http://new.photos.yahoo.com/bandrelationsair/album/576460762387457754


So that oil drum. 
They had a little shindig finally at The Nest with a couple BPT City Council members, let em check em out, have some cheese and what have you.
Long story short, I walked it to photos being taken of people in suits standing behind my drum.
Apparently, one of the council members liked mine so much he decided it should never be a trash can and should be put and kept on display in Bridgeport City Hall with a plaque of my bio, artist statement and the bio of the guy who organized all the oil drum art.
No shittin. I got interviewed, people were taking my picture. Newspapers were there.
I've already been in two newspapers that I know of.
I'd seek out the links somewhere, but I don't have it in me. I was mentioned in a lil paragraph in the Connecticut Post sometime near end of January and the Bridgeport News on my birthday. That one actually has a picture of the council members in front of my drum. I actually don't even have a copy of that, I tried to find it online and I just couldn't find it. But it does exsist.
Then this one Bridgeport council member thinks I'm super crazy awsome. He has my phone number, I've talked to him a couple times already. I think he might want me to do further ""art like"" projects in the future...or maybe he just likes me swagger. I don't know.
But then I got asked to attend a City Council meeting with the mayor and all that along with the guy, Jack, who organizes all the oil drum projects and David Flynn, who runs The Nest Art Gallery where we had it.
Now, I've never been to a city council meeting. I may be exaggerating...just a little, but you know that part of Star Wars: Phantom-crap-Menace where theres like that universal/galaxial almost coucil meeting and each planet had it own little balcony and it was just like miles of little balconies with aliens and/or people in them stacked over on top of each other?!??
Well that's what I thought of as soon as I walked into the coucil room. Ha. 
That half circle of desks, each row higher than the other with the mayor at the top.
I basically just sat there and listened. The begininng portion is where the public is allowed to address the council. That's where Jack spoke. I also realized that you really don't have to have anything to say at all if you want to address the mayor and all the council members. You just say you want to speak and then you can just complain about a 2-inch gap in the railroad tracks that causes your car to make loud sounds if you hit it going, say, 40mph. Or you can just talk about how dumb you think all the blinking yellow traffic lights are and if you even wanted to, you can end your statement with ""...soo, uh, yeah, Mayor. I want you to consider. That. Yes.""
Amazing.
Then the rest is the public observing the council yay or nay pages of proposals and all kinds of stuff I don't fully understand.
The council member that likes me made me stand up and introduce myself as the artist of the drum before them. I completely ""super model"" waved the mayor (Fabrizi...mmhmm) and the entire public and council. I was unaware that he was going to do that. I think he just wanted to see me red faced.
It was interesting to say the least.

I cut and pasted things and made the papers. I still don't even completely understand it. Regardless of if I think it was a bigger deal than needed...I'll take it. It felt pretty swell.

Also with the swellness....my birthday.
Again, spoiled, HARD.
I've said it before, its times like this that almost make me feel bad for every time I was ever less than awsome to anyone I know.
I got taken out on my actual birthday. A surprise of location, which Rob handled and it ended up being Hooters (......). Which I cussed at a waitress when she asked me if it was my birthday so they could make me stand on the chairs while everyone stares and I get sung to by roughly 8 pairs of pairs of knockers, in which all my friends laughed into the early morning taking pictures that will resurface someday I'm sure. I had the mahi tuna sandwich. It was delish.
Then, I got taken to Medievil Times in Jersey that Saturday. Our knight was the red & yellow knight. He lost, but seeing as I got to watch him ""slain"", I win anyways. I ate food with my hands, got a huge stein with liqour in it and was allowed to yell whatever I wanted at any knight. 
This there is actually video of. You can hear my half drunken pleas for the blue knight to 'cut your hair hippie' or when aimed at the black & red knight 'black & red is German for a whales vagina!' because he killed my knight and as a loyal soul I must avenge his death with tasteless heckles.
THEN, seeing my birthday is always right near the superbowl, Cristina had a super bowl/birthday party for me in which I got Chris Thompson and  a Carvel Cookiepuss.
This evening I also got gifts.

He's the zinger.
Between Cristina, Rob & Jeanne along with a few others that helped make it happen...
I GOT A NINTENDO WII!!!!!!
Then B & Julia got me Zelda:Twilight Princess and Tamsyn, Kraig and Austin got me Trauma Center, this awsome surgery game.

IN YOUR FACE!!!

Oh god, it's so awsome. 

I wanted to write this post because today I just started playing the Zelda game because I knew its not one of those games you can play for just 15mins. Everyone who plays it plays in hour increments...and by the time I finished saving, my log was at 8 1/2 hours.
That's right, aside from a trip to the store for cigs and an hour break to watch House, that's what I did today. I think I had work earlier, but I can't even remember what else I did with my day. I felt I needed to touch base with planet earth again before I slept.
I don't even understand how I played that long in one evening. It was like, I didn't want to be in my room so I entered the Faron Forrest and I just didn't want to come home. The springs are so beautiful and I was far too busy collecting tear drops from parasites so I could free a giant light spirit to gain the ability to change from elfish creature to wolf anytime I want as opposed to remaining in my wolf form doing deeds from some twilight shadow fairy that thinks his world of perpetual twilight isn't as bad as they say it is.

Exactly.
Screw him.

I'm out."

"event","FIRST...
I've come to realize that I know that you know that I like cats. But when you think this, some of you picture different particular cats I am particularly known to like.
I'd think most on this here LJ would say...Key. Cause really, she is the belle of the ball when it comes to felines. I fancy her. And then there's Creep. Who I hate ever since she went all HELLO GOOD-BIPOLAR on our asses. I hate her because I once loved. I still love, but with the motivation of hate. To love, to hate, to love. But all is fair in love and bipolar cats.
Anyways, I realized I've never communicated my love for my cats. At my house. That I've grown up with.  My saucy home slices.

This is all going to lead into a great story, I swear. As much as I can.

Introduction:
-I've had a ton of cats through out my whole life since I was 1-year-old. They have all been primarily outdoor cats. They'd come in during inclement weather, but I have a yard and woods, so they stayed out there to kill things for me as gifts. 

Subject 1: Anthony.
Now 18-years-old. He is what he sounds like. A grumpy old Italian man who's hard of hearing and just doesn't give a fuck anymore.
He's grey with green eyes and he's beefy in a non-fat way. Like a ""little lion"" which I used to call him in his younger years. Now, I refer to him as ""Old Man"".
If you pet his head, you better plan on being there for a while because when you stop, he will find that hand and he will jump at it and bite if necessary to continue said petting, but if you try and pick him up, he will back hand your grandmother.

Subject 2: Buddy.
An estimated 15-years-old. Buddy is the cat I gave a major gender complex to. When I was young, around 9, I said ""I want a cat named Buddy. I've wanted one for a while, but we keep keeping girl cats. I don't care. Next cat we get, I'ma name it Buddy. That's it. That's what I'ma gonna do.""
So I did, and I feel like when I was gone for that 3 years, everyone had completely forgotten that Buddy was in fact a girl cat. To this day, no one in my family barely ever gets it right.
Buddy I always explain by saying ""such a good cat"". Buddy never attacks, never causes trouble, is shy but enjoys just enough affection. Always wants to be around you, but just simply by you, never ""all up onz"". Buddy, unlike our dog, respects personal space.

Anthony and Buddy are actually half brother and sister from different litters, same mom. Anthony is the aggressor and Buddy is completely submissive to him. Buddy does what Anthony does. Anthony eats first while Buddy waits.
Basically, if something were to happen to Buddy, Anthony couldn't really give a shit. And if he did, hell, he'd forget after a couple days anyways. But if something were to happen to Anthony, no matter how much of a dick he was to Buddy, Buddy would miss him sorely and be quite lonely I'm sure of it.

Now. THE STORY. Of Buddy. Titled ""Such a Good Cat.""

A few weeks ago, Buddy was out in the yard with me, per usual. I was fixing up what was left of my garden and Buddy would follow me to which ever area I was in and sit directly on the other side of my chicken wired garden fence to accompany my almost every move.
For some reason in my backyard Concord grapes have taken to grow ""wild"" in vines in the trees and you can tell when they're ripe and there because you can SMELL THEM EVERYWHERE back there and they smell delicious!
So I step out of my garden and I just stand there looking up in the trees trying to find they're exact location and if they're even reachable. Buddy then comes to my side and sits facing the trees as if she were looking too. Then my mind goes somewhere else, I probably started thinking about ice cream or dinosaurs or sex involving ice cream with chocolate cover dinosaurs, the usual, but I stood there completely still for a while and the whole time Buddy stood just as still as I.
Then all of a sudden out of nowhere I hear Buddy let out a ""MERRROOOW"" and quickly turned and limped over a couple feet then laid down. Buddy not being a very vocal cat, I tended to her requests of attention. She let out a little meow again then tried to get up, but couldn't then flopped back down.
Anthony, being the cat that he is, heard Buddy's cry and immediately came rushing over as I thought to see what was wrong. But it turns out Anthony was just in a hurry to run over and head butt Buddy in her times of pain. I waved him away and Buddy eventually got up and started walking, but with a limp on her rear left leg. Due to the situation, I figured Buddy had maybe just gotten bit by a bug or one of those spiders my yard has seemed to have 10 times as many this year. If not that, maybe she went to move and just moved the wrong way and pulled something.
Over 2 weeks went by and although the limp didn't appear as painful to her in any way, it was still there. So off to the vet I took her.
The car ride was less than fun for her. I believe it may have been the worst car ride of her life. When we get there the vet starts pushing and pulling on the legs. The left is especially sore to her. The vet says maybe it's a jarred knee or a fracture. We then move on to the X-rays.
After waiting in the X-ray showcase room, the vet comes and and smacks the x-ray onto the light box. ""Look at that! That's a bb. There's nothing wrong with your cats leg. No fractures, no damage. Someone shot her with a pellet gun!""
Son of a bitch! There was nothing the vet could do. No damage was done, it didn't hit bone. It was in the muscle and fat of her rear left leg, near the butt. She said the bb was going to stay in her and wouldn't cause her any pain or harm. I figured, hell, Rob's been living with a bb in the palm of his hand for years, I guess my cat could live with one in her ass. Since the wound was somewhat fresh, all she could do was give pain meds if needed. Eventually the wound will heal and she'll be fine.

Buddy. My cat. TOOK A BULLET FOR ME.

While I was standing there. Right next to me, she was shot. I'm not even going to get into how or why it happened cause we don't know. It could have been a lot of ways. Could have been a kid deep in the woods shooting targets and missed. It could have been from a car driving by. On purpose or not. Who knows. But, the asshole neighbor came to mind as years and years ago when the cats ventured further the asshole neighbor's old wife once told my mother that when our cats would pick through his garbage he would shoot at them with his bb gun. And I know he has guns cause when I was about 8 or 10, his step daughter showed them too me when he wasn't home. Little does he know I've shot that very bb gun before and we even considered shooting the revolver he just left on the floor underneath his bed. We were trying to decide if it had blanks or real bullets in it. We decided to just let it be. It was much scarier than the bb gun. (WTF!!!!)
And I said it before, if I knew for sure who did it and if it was on purpose, I'd have no problem with breaking a nose. Now I'm not one to resort to violence, but in such situations, who couldn't argue a broken nose as deserving? 

Anyways. That cat very well could have taken that bullet for me. Now, the way we were standing. Buddy was to my left. She was hit on her left leg. If she wasn't such a good cat and didn't want to be around me and wasn't there at all, there's a good chance that that bb would be in my ankle right now. Buddy knows me so well, she knew I didn't have insurance so she took that bullet FOR ME!
I can't complain about a $130 vet bill I paid, not only is that cheap for a vet(including rabies booster, visit, meds, x-rays, medical waste), but I bet you anything Bridgeport Hospitals bill would have been MUCH higher.

I wish I could say that Buddy understands how much I sympathize and appreciate her. She's currently not speaking to me. Every time I go in the basement to visit her the past couple days she hides, which she never does, because last time she came to me I shoved her in a cage. Even when I come down with food, she thinks I'm trying to poison her because of the first time I tried to give her a piece of a med in her food. She tasted it immediatly and wouldn't eat the rest.
I'm sure in a week or so she'll warm up to me again and next summer she'll be accompanying me every time I tend to my caribbean hebeneros and white eggplant, except this season she'll be sporting kevlar underneath her fur coat.

Buddy. Is SUCH a good cat."

I'm just waiting to be tired. Jeanne's past out on my bed so I can't run up and down the walls in there, so I'm in the living room. Actually, let's be honest, anyone whos knows Jeanne would know that I probably could indeed run up and down those walls and she would be none the wiser.

Anyways.

Music? Well, I am going to see Reggie and the Full Effect this weekend. Then the weekend after Tamsyn informed me of a free ticket she would like to offer for Ani Difranco in RI. I swear, if she's lacking again, I'm cutting the bitch free. Ani that is. I've prob seen her at minimul, 10 times. Really due to my older brother, which is weird. I never even heard of her and he took me to see her when I was like 14, so I went to a bunch of times with him after that. Anyways, I half love half hate Ani Difranco at this point. You know, I don't care how deep you think you are, eventually all the good metaphors are going to be taken up and then you just have to use the bad ones and I feel like she knows that, so she writes slower songs with less words and tries to be more ""experimental"". There's only so many times you can stetch out ""I'm happy"" or ""I'm sad"" which can be communicated in roughly 3 seconds, but then per her style, stretched out to 4 mins and 55 seconds. I'm just not havin it. But I guess that's what musics really is, huh? There used to be a day where I would see her live and be truly moved. Now, I can barely hear her becasue a)she's not singing  and b) I can't actually hear her because the thesbians in front of me are too busy kissing and telling each other how much they love,love, LOVE each other to even care to listen (true story). I don't know, maybe I can't really hear her because I'm not truly ""listening"". And I think really, I just use Ani as a scapegoat for reasons that have nothing to do with her at all. Maybe other people ruined it for me, which is half my fault. I just can't take her slow ""deep"" shit anymore and that's all she's been doing. 
(This is the part where I talk to Ani)
God damn it Ani, I don't want to think that hard to understand. I don't want to have to dig to find your sadness, I got that 5 albums ago. While you're inside you're NY apartment thinking of more beautiful and tragic ways to communicate ""This world and great and sad. My life is nothing and everything. I appreciate love and lies. I am strong. I am weak. This is how you stick it to someone. This is how we breathe."" during this period you could have been outside living life and enjoying the better things. Just FUCKING SAY IT! I AM STRONG. I AM WEAK. THIS IS HOW YOU STICK IT TO SOMEONE!!! See I did it! I got it out of the fucking way, now I can concentrate on living and living presently without forgetting the way I came.

I think that for just one show, I would love for Ani to just appear on stage, wait till everyone's quiet. Pause, turn to the mic and just say ""...fuck it.""  and leave. And you know what? I think people would get it. I would. 
That would be bottomless to me. I'd get it and I'd love it.

Ok, I'm done with that. In reality, I'll more likely than not have a great time seeing her. I'm just an asshole. Plus, I hear she's prego, so who knows when she'll go out on tour again.

I also got Joanna Newsom tickets. Talk about crazy lyrics, but at least this broad was a literature major and thats where the lyrics all stem from. Plus, she plays a mean harp and that's what I'm really psyched about seeing live.

Right now I'm just drawing a blank.(I did take something to make me sleep, but it's just making me loopy so far).
I've got my head in my hand watching the dog dream on the couch. I find that she runs and barks at things quite often. Seeing she's never left our house other than a vet visit, I tell my mom that when she's dreaming of running, she's actually just seeing the same 50 feet of yard over and over again. Like Roadrunner, with a repetitive background.

Thanks probably my que, huh?

I'm going go try to X-mas shop in a haze on ebay and then hit the sack.

And if I'm lucky, hopefully tonight I'll dream of something great with a repetitive background."

"event","So I had a small adventure this week, which was not uncommon, but this one was particularly awsome. Rob was present. 

To start, I know some of you are familiar with One Red Paperclip. If not, here's a link:
http://oneredpaperclip.blogspot.com/

The idea behind One Red Paperclip was this guy named Kyle from Canada who wanted a house. He didn't care where, just a house. Paid for, in full and completely his, but without paying for it. by trading.
He started with one, red paperclip. He traded it to someone for a fish pen. Which he then traded up for a hand made cabinet knob, which he then traded for a Colemen grill...so on and so. After 15 trades and a bit of time he got a house. When he would get offers he would pick which one would be most useful then he would drive to their house to make the trade regardless of location.
Anyways, this guy Kyle has a brother Scotty who is doing his own project. I found out about it through a Myspace bulletin that One Red Paperclip had posted.
This new project by his brother Scotty is called Hitch 50.
Scotty and his friend Fiddy are going to hitchhike 50 states and take a picture in front of each state capitol building including Alaska and Hawaii in 50 days or less. On the website there was a link to offer them rides.
They kicked off this Tues. from the middle of Times Square in NY. I figured, ""Hey, I don't have work for the later half of this week and I like adventures, I like driving"" so I sent them a ride offer for CT.
They got back to me figuring they would be around CT around Fri. and wanted to know if I might be interested in driving them to Trenton, NJ. I said sure, jsut let me know.
Seeing this is a crazy adventure and really unpredictable, I got an email and a text message about 1:45AM on Tues night (Weds morning) saying basically ""Hey Carla, how about Providence, RI...tomorrow?"" So I called Rob to see if he'd be down last minute.
The next day we drove to Hartford to pick them up from a Motel 6 (conveniently located next to a Motel 8) and drove them from Hartford, CT to Providence, RI.
It was fun. We all talked the whole car ride about bizarre things and asked them questions about their trip and what not. They've been getting a good amount of coverage. When I asked them how they slept cause they were texting me till almost 3am, they told us how they got woken up at like 5:30AM by radio stations wanting to do interviews. Like, plural radios stations, like 12, just that day. Then they told me how Scotty's brothers red paperclip deal got him a book deal and possibly a movie I believe. Crazy. When we got to Providence we found the capitol building (conveniently located right next to the huge shopping mall). We took pictures with them and they made us talk into a mic and be on video for a minute, then we went inside to check out the capitol building.
From there a guy met them to drive them into Boston and hopefully after that they'd at least get to NH.

While I was in Providence, I had to call my buddy Evan because I knew he only lived 5 mins from that mall and I love him and haven't seen him in a while. He had work, but he met up with us just to bullshit and say hi for a little before he had to be in. It was great. I miss him. He graduates school in a semester and I want to try and get him to move to CT. 

Anyways. That was my adventure. Pretty fuckin sweet. Can't say it's something I can do any day. Meeting those guys and helping them along in their adventure makes me want to do something great to. I mean, hell, I do great things all the time, but it makes me want to do REALLY great things. Actually, Rob and I may be doing a small project that involves lots and lots of bricks. More to come on that.

So, their website is: 
http://www.hitch50.com

The cell phone that Scotty has has GPS in it so on the website you can watch them moving wherever they go. It's pretty cool. And if you go back to the previous posts he made, the one titled something like ""Can't wait for Chow-Dah"" there's a part where he talks about me on my way to pick him up and that all I wear is a 12-year-old hat.
Ha. We were corresponding and he told me what they would be wearing when I picked them up so I told them I'd be driving a silver Civic and wearing that hat and I'd have a passenger named Rob with a face that looks like he eats children with lox.

An added bonus to all this is, when they had us sign papers saying it was ok for them to use footage and photos of us, the paper has our contact info and when they reach their final destination, which should be Honolulu, they'll pick one of those papers from someone who gave them a ride and they get flown down there and put up for free and get to celebrate with them. The chances are slim, but that's still pretty sweet.

Here's some photos from their website:

"event","Well, I wanted to first inform, the introduce.

Last week I lost a friend. My betta fish, Davis, had passed away. I found him gills up late one night, so I then went out in the dark fending against the more than usual amount of spiders outside this year (wtf) and grabbed my garden shovel and buried him next to my deck.
You may remember him from this classic photo:
<a href=""http://photobucket.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v59/vsvictrolavs/BLENDER.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

See you on the other side, amigo.

Ha. I got almost 2 years out of him. The average life span is 2-3 years I hear, so he had a fair run.

Now for introduce.
This weekend I was in Boston. While I was gone, my mother actually went out and bought me another fish. So I came home and there was water back in my blender with a fish swimming around that looks just like Davis. 
I actually just tried to grab my digital camera and snap a shot to show...but I couldn't find it in 3 seconds so I gave up. Cause I'm a quitter.
Anyways, my mom didn't name him so I could. 
His name is Jefferson.
He has to be broken in. He's pretty shy in the bowl. Davis would actually see me coming towards his bowl and frantically swam towards the top cause he knew that when I was that close, he was going to get food. Then he would eat it viciously. I sometimes think that when I fed Davis, he only ate the food because he was so angry that something was in his water.

Anyways. Jefferson. He's a new addition.

Now, so why I was in Boston....
...to see Evanescence!
Cristina was supposed to come cause she hasn't been forever and I knew she would heart going to the show...but alas, she really is such a busy bunny that should couldn't even fit it in. 
So I took the hippie with me. The hippie whose recklessly good looks got a bouncer to let me stand on the stairs, which was sweet.
The show was sold out. Sold out for the Avalon means NO ROOM FUCK ANYWHERE. Me, being of below average height, couldn't see well. I was up against a pole on my tip toes to get any kind of view (which in the long run I guess it's better that Cristina didn't make the show ;) ). There were steps to a higher area, but you're not allowed to stand on the steps. I tried a quick attempt, but almost immediately got kicked out by another bouncer, but this other one got Jeanne's attention and tried to help out and she said something along the lines of ""it would really make her night if you let her stand on the steps""...so he did. The evil bouncer later came back and told the good bouncer to get me down from there. SO I did, and then good bouncer got me back up a littler after and somehow it was cool and I got to stay for the rest of the songs.
I knew it was going to be a good show. I had seen them play one song live years ago, and jsut from that I knew they would always be so good live. With her great voice, I can't tell if it's good or amazing that seeing them live sounds just like the cd's. Her voice is always on. Always. And it's 100% not lip syncing, fact. Her vocals are just so incredible.

Anyways. That was that. Speaking of ""that"", Cristina and I DID go and see That 1 Guy at Toads place like 2 weeks ago. He was opening for Buckethead. Yeah.
And I can't even go into how awsome it is to see him live. To watch him play...that ""thing"" he plays. Not to mention, he plugged in a cowboy boot and played it. Yes, he took a cable and inserted it into the heel of an old cowboy boot, stuck the ankle part under his arm, sole facing outwards and played it like a small synthesized drum with his finger. If that wasn't enough, he then PLUGGED IN a saw. Tapped it around a bit, the put on this belt with two pipes on it, stuck the saw handle between the pipes so he no longer needed 2 hands to hold , then he took a violin bow and played Somewhere Over the Rainbow on it. True. Story.

Then...Buckethead. Listen, I don't know a whole lot about that guy, but...for the song we stayed for him (which he was accompanied by That 1 Guy, which was crazygonuts) aside from being uber weird, I couldn't even comprehend how he plays guitar like he does. He has long fingers and they basically look like a blurry, rhythmic wave moving up and down a guitar neck.
It's just not supposed to happen.

That's that. For once, it's actually kinda cold. I'm about to be all up in some covers.

With a quickness."

"event","So the other day I just watched Suicide Circle/Suicide Club/Jisatsu saakuru for the first time.

If anyones seen this, I'd appreciate your help to steer me away from thinking this movie was the second biggest theatrical waste of my time. The first would be Mulholland Drive by David Lynch in which immediately after seeing it I went straight for the internet to try and find some meaning and reason for it to even exist. I tried, I tried really hard. And I found enough proof to feel strong enough that my decision on it being the biggest theatrical waste of my time was justified.

Now, I need help with this one.

I'm trying really hard to not possibly be ignorant about this film. If there were many things that I didn't understand, that I thought were stupid, that I thought completely lacked relevance or lack of any hint of an actual thought process that must have gone into creating a scene....I would like to believe that I must be missing something.

I know that translated subtitles can make it difficult at times to wholly understand what it trying to be communicated, but even when I watch Ju-On, the original Japanese version of ""The Grudge"", the subtitles didn't always transfer well and it got confusing and I didn't understand everything, BUT, I was still able to get through the movie and understand it as a whole. And it definitely was not one of the worst films I've ever seen, even if it wasn't the best. I got it. 

Suicide Circle, however, just completely blew my mind on how much a film can be filled with crap suck. Hell, maybe I can just blame it all on the subtitles. In the credits it claimed that the movie was translated and subtitled by a person who goes by the name of Cannibal King. And well, if you can't trust Cannibal King for quality, who can ya trust?!

Here's an example of inquiry: When that kid keeps making the phone calls to the police or authority like figures, why does he cough or make the clearing of throat sound after almost every word or sentence? It's clear they're not trying to disguise their voice. What gives?

Also, the only place where I feel might actually hold some kind of significance to the human language and really, seems as it should be the bottom line to the whole film is the part where the kids in different areas almost explain to people why they should be killing themselves.
The shtick that goes something along the lines of:
How do you relate to you? How do you connect to you?
If you were to die, your connection to your family would still remain. It would live on.
If you were to die, your connection to your boyfriend would still remain. 
But what is your connection to you?

Somewhere in there that is supposed to rationalize the idea of everyone killing themselves. That if you understand that, you should just kill yourself. No questions asked. And it seems everyone was doing it. And that was the movie.

If I don't get a satisfactory response from anyone on here, I admit, I will look into it a little further, but I think I will still refer to this film as complete and utter crap suck and I'll urge people to prepare a tomato juice bath if they plan on watching it, only as a precautionary measure to help remove the stink once they're done.
The only difference will be that if the response is satisfactory, I may no longer consider it the second biggest theatrical waste of my time. I'll probably bump it down to maybe 4th or 5th.

Please advise."

"event","Speaking of lightning...
Ironically, I just came on to make this post which originally involved lightning, then I see Dave just posted on the matter. Lightning, all around!

Ok, so don't ask me why, but I was on ebay searching for fulgurite pieces. Sand fulgurite is whats left after lightning strikes sand, I believe there has to be quartz involved, but it melts the sand into basically a glass. Sand glass tubes made by lightning. Rock fulgurite is almost the same thing, but it's when lightning strikes rock.
Anyways, somewhat interesting, or at least I thought and I was thinking that for a small price I'd like to own some sand fulgurite so I could at least see it first hand. Because thats something I've never seen before...so I must see it.

So I'm searching ebay...and I ran upon this little gem from Shanghai, China. I'm not going to explain. You just need to see it. 
Unfortunatly, by the time you see this the auction will be over, but you should still be able to view the auction for at least 90 days.

"event","...and the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee.

and the meteorite's just what causes the light
and the meteor's how it's perceived
and the meteoroid's a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee. ""


ANYfuckWAYS.

There is something very important I need to broadcast. I would have done it sooner, but I was away helping to move Old Man Thompson to a new apt. and then when I got back I haven't really had internet since...and really. I don't even know if I have it now. In 5 minutes it could cut out again.

The big news. I HAVE OFFICIALLY BEATEN GUITAR HERO. 
That's probably my biggest gaming accomplishment ever. 
I know it doesn't seem like much and it may not be, but because I only really know 1 other person who plays it (Brian) and I beat it before him, that's something. Cause Brian always wins in video games.
I have faith that he will eventually beat it without a doubt, but that fact that not only did I do it first, but that I even did it at all. 
For all I know, most people who play it have beaten it. But I don't know that. So for now I'm proud.

The last two songs on Expert took me almost a month. Cowboys from Hell by Pantera and Bark at the Moon by Ozzy. It got to the point where I would turn it on, warm up on other songs which always started with Killer Queen by Queen cause I love that song and it's almost safe to say it's prob my favorite on all of Guitar Hero, and then I would make 1 attempt a day at Bark at the Moon. Any other time I beat all the songs on other difficulty levels, no one was ever there to see the little ending and my little celebratory dance. But when I beat the whole game on expert, Jeanne was there and I was quite jumpy and ecstatic. I think a little spit even fell out of my mouth too.
Anyways, when you beat every song (not including bonus songs) on every difficulty level....you get the Battle Axe.
It is what it sounds like. A guitar shaped like a big battle axe with blood on it. Unfortunately, my character of choice is the grim reaper and he can't play any other guitar than the scythe, which is cleverly made into a guitar. But I momentarily switched characters so I could see the axe in action...so don't worry. I bet you were.

<b> This is the part of the entry where I talk about real life (if you can call life with Guitar Hero real...pfffftt.) Just kidding. I like life sans Guitar Hero too. </b>

So same old. I've been out and about. Remember like a year ago or so when I would talk about not sitting still and I'm never home and I'm always doing something and I felt like I never stopped? Well...I still feel that way. And I don't know why. It actually almost stresses me out at times. And when I say I'm doing things. Yes, work, chores, shit I need to do...but thats not what I feel is really keeping me moving. It's fun things that I actually think I do too much of. And not recklessly. I'm not blowing tons of money or excessively drinking. In fact, I drink prob a MODEST half as much as I did when I lived in Boston. Really, more like a fourth now-a-days. I'm rarely hammered. Oh I still drink, but less hammered. 
And it really makes me think, was my life so dull for those 3 years in Boston that what I've been doing here for nearly 2 years now seems like a hurricane of fun? Cause I don't think my life was THAT dull there. (<b> This is the part that I cut out where I teeter between liking and hating Boston and whining about the cold girls and hot heartbreaks of a city divided. We've all heard it. I spare you. </b> )But my life really wasn't that dull there. So what gives? I mean, I am spoiled here. I mean, just this summer-ish alone I was in Austin, TX for a week and took a 12 day trip through the upper east and Canada. Both, barely on my dime. Not to mention all the frequent Boston trips to go to shows and hang out with Thompson $ friends. Poor hard working Cristina hasn't seen Boston, or really any other area outside her house, school or hospital...in maybe almost a year. Couple weeks ago Jeanne and I took a two day trip just through parts of CT doing fun things like nice retaurants and apple, peach and pear picking at the orchards in Branford. Then, after the leaves start to change, we're gonna go back to Ithaca, NY for a weekend cause I'm sure it's going to be absolutely gorgeous there (no pun intended). And in a couple weeks I'm going back to Boston to see Evanescense with NC7-tina. Plus, you better believe I'd like to go sky diving again before the snow starts. And with the bigger events aside, I'm always doing SOMETHING, cooking lovely dinners, renting the old seasons of Entourage, going to see friends bands at bars, eating TK's chicken wings, occasionally a round of frisbee golf, sitting at the cafe drinking decaf tea with friends that are drinking coffee, going to the 24 hour walmart with Rob at 2am to play video games, bon fires, almost mud pits, nice restaurants near the Maritime Center, buying feeder fish for a fat turtle, dropping off film, picking up film, movies, my laundry, my room, my room, my fucking room that is still not structurally where I want it to be....
bitches, I got plans and I'm too busy having good old fashioned fun to make much progress on them. And it's hard for me to feel like this is a bad thing because it seems like everything I do is in moderation. I don't do any one of these things that much. It's not how much I do, it's how many. And I can't decide if this is an extremely blessed lifestyle or a carefree and fancy one. And if that's even wrong. I'm enjoying life with my friends while at a tortoise like speed moving forward in it. There is movement, just not great. 
Part of me says I should get that more alone time I sometimes feel like I'm fighting to get and take care of just things I'd like to take more care of, but in the end it's me who picks up the phone and abandons the idea for an outing on the town or street. But the other part of me says ""I go to work. I pay my bills. I water my plants. I get by just fine and do what I need to do. Remember when you left home and all your friends for 3 years and you missed them terribly and then you came home and it was so great again? And now you realize how much harder it's going to be to do that a second time, but you will leave again. Be it six months from now or 6 years. You may never have it like this again after that. Enjoy it while you have it.""
I can't decide.

Oh whatever. I originally just started this entry to gloat about Guitar Hero. I get so carried away so easily. By the way, that kicking a kitten remark only would have been a dig towards Mike if I said it was a dead one, but I didn't. ;)
Seriously, I probably spend 25% of every day thinking/worrying about the future. Some days I wish I had never stopped smoking pot. Other days I wish I had slept less. 

And with that I don't think I'm any different than anyone else.
I just think I have a LiveJournal, a big mouth and an affinity for progress.




<b>Added Note of P.S.:</b> I just realized that I actually cut the part about kicking a kitten, so that was just out of context and must have been awsome to read. Ha. In the whiny boston part that I cut, I had said something along the lines of girls there ""...making me so miserable I could kick a kitten..."". Haha. But for the hell of it, I'll make it a dig at Mike anyways. Officially digging."

"event","Lets talk about a few things. Or I'll just write them. Let me express.
Movies.
Now, I don't know if anyone ever planned on ever seeing Final Destination 3. Most don't.
I happen to have for some reason or another seen the first 2. The first one was only good because of the feature where you can watch commentary over the entire movie and there was actually some pretty interesting stuff, but really, I don't even think the original director was involved at all in the third movie, or prob even second for that matter.
The premise of these movies is about cheating death and in each movie everyone basically dies in all kinds of at time elaborate but always majorly fucked up ways.
Now, what made me actually want to see the third and most likely would not have looked twice anyways without...is the ""awsome"" feature this movie on dvd had to offer.
Choose the fate of the characters. Just like those choose your own adventure books. ""If you want to go into the tunnel, turn to page 43. If you want to keep on the path, turn to page 78.""
On the dvd for Final Destination 3, at key points in the film a screen pops up and you get a choice of what the characters could do. Ex: There's a coin toss to see who rides the front of the rollercoaster (which in the movie, only the people in the front cart die, all the people in the back cart get off). You get to choose heads or tails. Ex: A giant sign is about to fall on someone, you choose if they step to the left or to the right.
And in supposedly choosing the fate of all these characters, you would change the entire outcome of the movie.
I thought this was revolutionary. Genius! Hours of fun!
WRONG. 

<b> WRONG WRONG WRONG</b>
Bottom line, your choices mean next to nothing. Out of every character that dies (which is a lot of them, maybe 10ish) you can only save ONE, and he's basically a non-significant character. By saving him, the story is no different. The only thing you get is a bonus feature really. This character at the beginning of the movie carried a video camera with him. By saving him, he just gets arrested 15 minutes later and you never see or hear of him again, but because he's arrested his camera goes into police evidence and you get to watch the footage that was on his camera. It's alright, but nothin that effects the story line at all.
As for the other characters. They all die the exact same way except for one. Original was two girls get burned to death in tanning beds. The ""alternate"" death is, one actually makes it out of the bed, but then gets electrocuted instead. The other girl still burns, but I guess catches a little electricity too. And like I said about the ""coin toss"", what you didn't notice the first time was when it's tossed all the guy says is ""call it in the air"" never specifying what heads or tails means. So whatever way the coin falls, the same damn kid is going ride front. And the sign falling. Nothing differnt. He steps left, he get nailed with it. He steps right, same thing. No different in any way.

Dag. I really had to get that out. I feel duped. Bamboozled. Flimflammed.

Anyways. On the same note, different key...I ended up seeing Clerks II twice. It's a nice flick. Thompson liked it, but was disappointed in the lack of ""fast-paced-intelligent-banter"". And I can basically agree, but it was still great. What I don't agree with was when Jeanne stated that if I enjoyed the ""fast-paced-intelligent-banter"" of Clerks so much, then there's no reason I shouldn't like Gilmore Girls.......(silence)....
I then told her that was like comparing a cat to a house. 
One of the most brilliant parts of that movie was the MOST GRATUITOUS breast bouncing I've ever seen in the scene where ""Becky"" (played by Rosario Dawson) is dancing on the roof. Like, that had to be intentional. I can't see how it couldn't be. If not, people on set must have been secreting laughing their asses off while making mental photo albums.
I hardcore crush on Rosario Dawson ever since Josie and the Pussycats. Not as much in Sin City, then totally on again in RENT, then all over again in Clerks II. But now that I know she was in the movie ""KIDS"", I don't dare see it again cause I don't want to ruin a good thing. 
Sidenote: Sin City 2 comes out in 2007. She we be in it again.

And on another key, different song. I also hardcore crush on Sarah Silverman. If in actuality she doesn't happen to be a cold bitch, I'd completely marry her.

And finally. Sweet shrimp dinner.
I had sushi this evening at a place in Trumbull. I had ordered a piece of sweet shrimp sashimi. On my plate along with it was a giant, partially fried shrimp head. 100% intact. Even with his one-exploded-deep-fried eye and one non-exploded-deep-fried eye. Both stared at me throughout my entire dinner even after I cover his face with my garnish. When I first got it, I took it upon myself to be an asshole and started talking to him and rubbed it in his face that the other half of him on my plate was going to go in my mouth and I turned him so he had to watch. Well, the karma for that was that was the most disgusting thing off the top of my head that I have ever tasted. I can eat some rank stuff. I've ordered plenty sushi that I knew I wouldn't like, but would just want to eat anyways for the experience and absurdity. No mater how gross these sushi pieces were, I could totally swallow them. No. Not this guy. Seeing it was a nice restaurant I excused myself, kept it in my mouth and threw it out in the LR (ladies room!).
I've actually had sweet shrimp before. This one time in NYC, but they were much different. It was 3 teeny tiny shrimp served cold (cause it's raw) on a paper thin fried disc of turnip with special sauce. It was pretty good.
This was nothing like that.
This is a shrimp.

"event","So...
I picked up a new cd today. DragonForce ""Inhuman Rampage"".

If you plan on sleeping that day, you have to stop listening to this album 6 hours before scheduled bedtime.

In-FUCK-sane.
This is what they sound like:

Take a few guys from Journey and a small handful of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.
Someone sits them all down in a room and stares at them in silence for nearly 23 minutes. Then all of a sudden walks over to Steve Perry and open hand slaps him across the face (in exchange they all feel it too because we all as humans feel Steve Perry's pain) then proceeding the slap, a stern and steady wag of the finger in their faces as to show authority. Then this person disappears.
This is on a very small, SMALL, scale of how metal is made.
So then these guys heavily bump speed while partaking in a 4-day bender of coke counting 15lbs per nostril per day per person. That is, all of them, except Steve Perry.
On day four they make music. They make music so hard it melts the soles of their shoes.
Then when they've played all they can play they fall over dying semi-quickly after a few paced heart thumps. They most likely will bleed out.
All of them perish...except for Steve Perry.
He walks out of the studio, out onto the street, waves to his fans, and even kisses a baby before reaching his car. 
Steve Perry is unscathed, but he does stay in bed for the next 3 days.


Ok, so that is what I think they sound like. Except no ones dead and it involves neither Trans-Siberian Orchestra nor Steve Perry....or does it?

And it sucks me in like I cannot believe. To the point where I can feel group therapy someday.

Yeah, I've wanted it for a while, but never have the money. Then they had it on display while, me, Brian, Rob, Julia and Jamie were at Best Buy and we were all playing it. Then the stores about to close. Then I silently convinced myself that buying it right then and there was the greatest thing I could do all year. I remembered I had a gift certificate from Xmas I hadn't used yet.

If you're not familiar, it's Guitar Hero for PS2. An interactive guitar video game with a mock guitar controller. You play guitar to real songs (sung by people who sound just like them for copyright purposes) from White Zombie to Cream to Franz Ferdinan to Boston to Bad Religion to Joan Jett to Hendrix and then some. It's crazy.

Right now I'm on my honeymoon with it. I can't get enough and I need to tell everyone all about it, but in 6 months or so I'll still love it, but I won't touch it as much. I'll only occasionally talk about it. I'll stop holding it when it crys. You know.

The night I got it we all went to Brian's and played it until I had to go home and sleep cause I had work the next day. Then after I got home Jeanne and I played it till about 230 in the morning.
The next day, all my waiting time between clients at work was spent in my room playing it. I beat it on easy then started halfway into medium. After I was done with work I came home and played it some more. Jeanne came by again for a bit and we played. I took breaks here and there, but I'd say in total, I played for a minimal of 6 hours that day. I made myself stop and read a book when it got late to calm me down a bit.

<b>ADDED FUN FACT:</b> I'm even bringing it with me when I go to Boston tomorrow so me and Thompson can sit at his place and drink and rock out during the late evenings. Also, I am seeing Kay Hanley tomorrow night. Such awsomeness can actually tear me away from Guitar Hero for a couple hours. Heart. Her. Platonically.

<b>ADDED FUN FACT TWO:</b> Since I am busy tonight and will be in Boston for the rest of the week, Brian is disappointed that I will not be able to bring the rock back over his house anytime soon. So he has informed me that he is going out to buy one hilself tonight. This. Is great. I was longing for some competition and he is the man who would give it to me. Platonically. We're gonna rip and tear untill he eventually gets better than me, cause he will, but then that will make me want to be even better. And that's fun.

It's kind of like the way I was with DDR, except you can't play that as long cause you'd get too tired after about 2 hours of it. But this only involves my hands...and well...

It's way worse than DDR. 

I am utterly fascinated. And I thought you should know. Cause I think you'd like it too. 

Unless you're Rob. And you play guitar like a quadriplegic."

"event","Time is something that can daunt me and my existence. Time passing. We get older.
Now I know, I'm only the ripe age of 24 now. Not even a quarter of my long life I will live. I'm a mere babe. But I worry when I have the time.
I'm no longer a teenager. Those years are the pinnacle of ""hip"". I think about things like ""When I was a child, I didn't have any WORLD WIDE WEB, we had Odell Lake and the Oregon Trail."" or ""We all had home phones. I still had a rotary. If you weren't home, no one could reach you. Pay phones were a dime and you could talk as long as you wanted though. Some people had these things called 'pagers', but really, they were only for doctors and drug dealers."" Kids now are growing up far different that I did. We did. I remember what it was like for parents to not understand their children's lifestyles and their technology. When you were young, you thought they were insane. How fun could their life had been without the things we have? You'd think. 
Lawn darts. Who the fuck would every let those things get out to the public now-a-days? I'm lucky I kept both eyes after the years of play we had.
I worry about not understanding whats ""cool"" ""hip"" anymore. Not saying that I agree, but totally not understanding. Like how adults didn't understand why kids my age sometimes wore pants that were 12 times the size of our torsos. Marilyn Manson. Not that I was a fan, but at least I understood. And I never thought that his music caused people to rob homes and shoot up schools. Just because it wasn't something I was into, didn't mean that I was appalled by it's existence and wanted it banned. I understood.
Some time last year, I was watching an episode of South Park where R. Kelly sang to John Travolta to please ""get out of the closet"". It was funny. And I understood it. Then I thought to myself ""If I hadn't happened to home that day bored and watched VH1 with the R.Kelly marathon of his ""Trapped in the Closet"" videos, I would not have understood that joke. It wouldn't have been funny. And that worried me.
So now that I'm older and have a job and a nightlife and don't watch MTV anymore, does that mean I'm loosing touch with the top selling market? Am I not as much in ""the know""? Is what I think interesting what teenagers would yawn at? I garden. Is that ""gay""? When did ""gay"" become such a term of disapproval? My twin cousins are now 15. If anything isn't cool, it's ""gay"". Does anyone even say ""lame"" anymore? I feel like the term ""snake in the grass"" is a thing of the past. 
It's times like these that I feel I have already lost a part of my younger years. I feel I don't know where this next generation is going. I heard that this next generation has a ""gay"" name like ""the millenions"", I don't know, something like that. Though my generation which can be classified as ""Generation Y, MTV Generation, or the Boomerang Generation (missed generation x by one year)"" this new generation is said to be very activity orientated and ""highly medicated"", not kidding. A friend I have who works for a college in Boston, actually described the new incoming students of this generation as ""highly medicated"" at the annual meeting. In result, this generation feels they are owed more than they deserve. Chris Thompson actually wants to write a dissertation of some sort on this as he's the RA of our old school (which is not the friend working at a school I just spoke of. Actually, it's Babson who said that. So there.)
Anyways, with this new line of thought they carry, I fear I will not understand them someday. 
And all this worry, all this second guessing has been brought to me by one, single, moment.
One single event that has left me speechless.

Promiscuous Girl by Nelly Furtado featuring Timberland.

I'll give you a minute to let that sink in.

.....
What a load of HORSE SHIT.
I was speaking to my good friend Jersey Dave, via Instant message, and he told me he was listening to Nelly Furtado. I said ""it could be worse"" he said ""No. It can't.""
A few days later I recieved the ""honor"" of hearing Nelly and Timber perform ""Promiscuous Girl"" live on Conan for the first time. After viewing and listening I immediately ""text messaged"" Jersey Dave with ""Remember that time you were listening to Nelly Furtado and I said it could be worse and you said no?"" ""yeah"". ""I was wrong.""
Since then I've actually be graced with seeing this song performed live 3 times and once the album version. Which if you haven't seen it live, I'd suggest it as long as you have a working electric egg beater was within arms reach so you could soon after ease the pain by sticking it down your throat while humming along.

It is this point in life where I think I know nothing. 
Everything I thought that was true and pure has been obliterated and shit on.

I would much sooner understand every lyric written by ""The Kids of Whidney High"", (http://www.kidsofwidneyhigh.com) which if you didn't know, in the unpolitically correct term are a bunch of highschool ""special"", retarded children that somehow managed to crank out an album of music which features songs like ""Life Without the Cow"" that later took to many college student made internet videos...
I would comprehend life ""without a cow"" before I could grasp how a song like that would ever sound like a brilliant idea and agreeable effort to expand the worlds everchanging but singular view of music by any artist, record producer and even hobo on the street with his pecker in his hand.

I'm sorry, I can't say much more. I think the point I'm trying to head for is clear and if I think about this any further my unborn grandchildren will get dumber.

If you happen to fancy this ""hip track"", that's fine. I hold no grudge. You must be a young spirit and have adapted better than I.

But on the other side with greener grass, I can take this. If this shows a hint of what the future will hold as ""hip and cool"", then I don't want to be the cat's pajamas.

I am just as awsome with my chocolate bell peppers and early girl tomatoes and always will be.

I am timeless.

Oh and by the way, my road trip through the upper east and Canada was phenomenal. And after I got home I couldn't wait to finish turning the soil and put up my new fence."

Between that and ""Any Way You Want it"" by Journey....any silent space in my head for the day is shot to hell.
Last time I was in Boston I saw Reggie and the Full Effect and they covered it. Rocked much. And since then I get it roughly once a week for different periods of time.
Anyways.
So I'm a traveling whore. Did I go through this in an earlier entry? Let me look. Ahh, I don't feel like reading my own entries. I wonder how YOU feel? Haha.
I'm a traveling whore. Whore, because I don't really pay. And it'd be a lie if I said I was sleeping with EVERYONE I know. Just the usual suspects. The butcher, the baker, candle stick maker...and the Denver Broncos. For good measure.
But seriously, to start, that day trip into Manhattan to see RENT in Jan. Fully covered by Jeanne for Xmas. That trip to Austin, plane fair covered by Thompson as a birthday and xmas gift from last year cause he was poor and couldn't really get me anything. I didn't even mind or think twice, then he pulls out the Texas business. RAD! Then (which doesn't actually follow the trend of travel, but follows me being taken out) the other week I saw Moving Out and Cristina paid for it as an Xmas gift.
Little tid bit about Moving Out. It's interpretive dance. All of it. No speaking. I didn't know that. I enjoyed it, I did, but if I hadn't read the short outlines in the play book for act's 1 & 2, I would have had no idea what the hell was going on.
So....my newest whore of a trip...I'll call it: 
""The Great Escape 06: Canadian Version 6.8""
Jeanne and Carla.
A roughly 12 day road trip. 
Begining in CT, lunch in Northampton, MA then resting in Burlington, VT. Burlington to Montreal, Quebec. Montreal to Ottawa, Ontario. Ottawa to Toronto, Ontario for a good 4-5 day stay. Then Toronto through Niagara to Buffalo, NY. Then Buffalo to Ithaca, NY then if we have any money left, spend one more night in the Catskills Mountains before back to CT.
Oh. Yeah.
This trip's accommodations are being covered some by Jeanne as a birthday gift and the other by Julia as a b-day gift. Julia has time share and said that she wasn't sure if Brian could take off anymore vacation this year so she gave some of it to Jeanne and me for 4 nights in Toronto at the Radisson. How. Fucking. Awsome. Is. That.
I mean, there's still other expenses I have to pay for obviously, but really...can't get much better than that and it still makes me quite a whore.
Seriously though, with friends like this maybe I really should be giving out complimentary hand jobs and oral treats. That could hard to argue.

I'm leaving soon and contrary to what this may sound like, I still am a decently poor monkey and I currently have a load of shit up on ebay in efforts to get money before the trip and still be able to pay my student loannnssssFUCKSALLIEMAE and my car insurance.
Plus, I've been doing an awsome job on booking sweet hotels for minimal money to save Jeanne some bucks. If there's anything I've learned, whenever you go somewhere, find their tourist headquarters (AKA.www.tourisme-montreal.org) and getting the phone number and calling. They will hook you up with travel needs, road maps, event calenders, activitie books...and they even offer to help you with accommodations offering prices on nice hotels that you can't find on hotels.com, expedia, anything. I looked. Ex. They got me a 3 star hotel in downtown Montreal, which I had seen on hotels.com, for about 50 bucks a night. Seriously. On hotels.com I believe it was about 100. And you can only get it through them cause they have a deal and/or in cahoots with that certain hotel.
Anygay.
That's my newest hoorah and it's going to be sick.
Other than that, things have been good. I was part of another opening at the art gallery. It was fun. Plus, there was this whole oil drum piece going on that I took part of. This fellow runs this oil drum art deal and he was doing a piece where people took 55 gallon oil drums and painted or whatever medium, did them up, put them on display here and there, then eventually they're gonna be garbage cans in Bridgeport. Since I'm not much of a painter, I used some paint and mostly comic books. I learned how great mod podge can be. Hard to explain, but I glued full pages of comics to it, then painted lightly over it with a sunset from a photo I took in Boston because for some reason I always think of that photo for sunsets for no particular reasons. Actually, let me find it....this photo..
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v59/vsvictrolavs/Copy_of_skyline_sunset_blurrrr.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>
...and then I painstakingly cut out only the black areas of comics for days. I used those pieces to make a continuous skyline across the barrel including 4 different cities. Bridgeport, Boston, Los Angeles and Austin. The only thing in color is the smoke stack in Bridgeport which is red and white. Short answer to why I chose those cities, either I lived there and they meant something to me or I have friends that moved there from CT. In fact, other than my ladies in Nashville, every one on here is currently in one of those cities.
(Obligatory) One of these days I'll post pictures.
The guy who was running it has done a lot of stuff with oil drums. For sometimes political and environmental causes. It was cool. He even said in the furture, maybe 3 years or so, he wants to do this international deal with them, giving grants to a certain city who comes up with the best installation of oil drum art idea and he wants Christo and Jean Claude as judges. That. Would be insane.
Apparently they're going to have a judging ceremony of the drums some time in June I think. My drum came out ok. Maybe I'll win 50 bucks to Best Buy or Penthouse. Either way. Ha. A good sign is that I think my oil drum may be at an art gallery in Waterbury right now cause I went back to the gallery and I noticed there were less drums on the main floor and I didn't see mine there anymore and I know there was something going on in Waterbury. Or...they may have moved it to storage. Who knows. But good news also is when it does become a trash can (after it is art which they made a point of saying. ""All drums are currently art."" But they will soon be trash, I like that irony for some reason) they will have a list of where each drum is so I'll know what corner mines on so I can drive by to watch the homeless urinate on it. Haha.
Honestly, I like that for some reason. I like that I put time into something so it can slowly become destroyed. Ok, maybe not pissed on, but, you know. 

Well, back out to work I go. I have to meet up with the same asshole who blew me off from 11am to 5pm(when I'm supposed to be back at the office) last time, then kept me there till 20 after 6 which after all the waiting he just pawned me off to a lot kid who was super nice, but really had no idea what he was doing.

Get that dollar.

Much."

I think the most effective way to tackle my Texas trip with Thompson in a lengthy/awkward way on here would be in the shotty, bullet type fashion.
For starters, extra rad, hold the pickles.
No bullets. Boldets.
<b>Plane Ride</b> So, I originally thought it to be 6 hrs, not true, only about 4. Our first layover was in St. Louis. I saw NO arch. In fact, I don't think it exisits. I think they print it on postcards, like, a really good idea. At the St. Louise airport, Chris and I were eating, with about 20 mins before the plane is to take off, and apparently that makes us late, so our names got called over the entire airports loud speakers ""Christopher Thompson and Carla Lia, please report to terminal C...Christopher Thompson and Carla Lia..."" Which in my mind, means we reigned over the entire city of St. Louis. Fin. The plane from St. Louis to Austin held roughly...3 1/2 people, one being the stewardist. Seriously, like 30. Tiniest. Plane. Ever. 
On the flight home our layover was in Houston. Yeah. ::crickets:: ::crickets::
<b> Mike/Spen's house/tent/Thompson likes to call it ""Commune"" </b> Apparently located in the ""ghetto"" of Austin, which really, did not seem bad at all. Just some excessive dog barking. A little one story ranch, with a front door that's usually open, a porch that was made solely for sitting and drinking, an old 1960 Jeep in the front yard, a palm tree and a number of stray cats that they've taken to feed. Each with their own character flaw name. ""Siamese If You Please"" ""Poofy/Poopy"" ""Hitler/Chapplin""....and so on. It amused me.
Anyways, regardless of what that sounds like, it was a chill place and enjoyed using that porch for a week.
<b>SXSW</b> Sick. We didn't actually have bracelets for anything. Just were there during it, but enjoyed what we did. Thompson and I saw and heard a bunch of bands, but I couldn't tell you the names of any of them. It's hard to guage what Austin is REALLY like cause while we were there, so was everyone else, but I think we got a good idea. Austin, apparently music capital, USA. Rad.
<b>6th St.</b> This street is bar central. Every door is basically a bar or club, mixed with the occasional convenient store or bad pizza stand. Awsome. Thompson and I bar hopped one night and took a cab home (a c-a-b). A drink at every bar. Sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less. I think we hit about 6 or 7, then we were both trashed and actually ate the bad pizza (what the hell is wrong with them Texans? that shit is HORR-I-BLE!!) Not that I have much say, but, I am declaring the best bar in Austin, TX. And it's this bar called Pete's which regualrly features dueling pianos. Two grand pianos facing each other and theres these two guys that sit there and play covers all night and take requests and they're hilarious. It's like group karaoke. Me and Chris walked in on the begining of Devil Went Down to Georgia and it went from there. We drank and we sang loudly with everyone and the painists (penis) (penis's) Piano Fellows, cracked jokes and played. ***** 5 Star.
~Note about bars/resturants in Austin. Being that it's Texas and the weather is usually warm, most places has some sort of outdoor patio. It's great.
<b>Food</b> Also, seeing that Austin is 3 maybe 4 hours from the Mexican boarder, it seems like about 80% of the eateries out there are mexican food. As I said before, on the other hand, these people could not make a slice of pizza to save their life. Also, going back, I always said that it wasn't till I moved to Boston did I realize that I had been spoiled my whole life with the best pizza, arguably, in the nation. If you ask, most will say NY has it. The only other area where pizza is infamous is Chicago, but they're famous for their deep dish, so that's really a different story. My edge of CT touches NY, my town roughly an hour or so to Grand Central, so basically all that good pizza just slowly ozzed over the boarder and settled in places here and there. New Haven, 15 mins from me, houses arguably two of the best, Pepe's & Sallie's. Whatever. I love pizza. Back to Texas.
The traditional mexican was good. And, of course, we ate at a Sonic's at one point because we had to. Their slushy type drinks are very pleasing on the palate.
When you are in Texas, they seem to serve Ranch with everything. Fries, burgers, jalapenos poppers, I even think thats what they gave me with my hot wings,  a side of ranch with your ranch? If not that, ranchero sauce, basically, the mexican ranch. I'm not complaining. I like it.
Fritos. I'm sure you've heard. They do weird things with em there. The most common I think, is on a burger. Couple places called them ""Bean Burgers"". I got one with chicken. The burger, a layer of refried beans, some salsa type sauce and a layer of Fritos. Good. Thompson had something of the sort for breakfast almost everyday at the Dairy Queen next to Mike & Spen's. Burger, nacho cheese, chili, and Fritos. 
<b>Disc Golf. AKA:Frisbee Golf</b> So we played those little versions Spen taught us at the Milford green. In Texas, it's considered a sport. Big time. We played on a ""professional"" course there. 18 holes. ""Professionally"" called ""Disc Golf"". They don't fuck around. They carry ""disc"" bags with 10 different frisbees, my bad, ""discs"". Ones for short range, mid-range,for long distance, putting discs. 6 of us played doubles. It was sweet. I even bought a couple ""professional"" discs while we were there so I could play back home after I found out that there were a couple actual courses in my area and that Dabrowski and a few others still played. I might go this week. I'm psyched.
<b>Music Stores </b> The guitars I saw were insane. Lots of old vintage stuff, that if you saw it in CT, they would be way more money, but music's so big there I guess they can spare the change. Slide, table guitars. String instruments. A sitar. I even saw a guitar with a small harp attached to it's body. No shit. Oddly, no music store we went to did I see drums.
<b>Banjo</b> I played a banjo.
<b>Austin Zoo and Wildlife</b> The zoo was awsome. Ring tailed Lemurs!! Lots of monkies of all kinds. Lions, tigers, and bears! Ok, no tiger actually, but lepards, a black panther. Galapagos tortoises. Small furry things with little human hands. Animals I've never seen before in my life! Some day soon I'll post all the pictures. 
Armadillos are native to the area. So are rattle snakes, black widows and brown recluse. Kinda freaked me out, do you know what happens if you get bit by a brown recluse? Or a fuckin black widow? ...but whatever. Geckos. One was hoppin around the house. And their bird of choice, the Grackle. Way cooler than a robin. Way cooler.
<b>San Antonio</b> We visited San Antonio for a day and went out to dinner with Dave and Melissa. There was a river inside of a mall. Then back to New Braunfels to their joint for a bit. I met a bunny that thumps when it's angry. It seemed to be very angry. It was a fun day.
<b>Contrary to Popular Belief...</b> It is NOT a dry heat in Austin. Not only does it get hot, but humid too. It's close to the Gulf of Mexico. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Also, from what I've heard, Austin is the only blue area of Texas. Anything liberal would be in Austin. This explains why it was awsome. They also have this guy: http://www.kinkyfriedman.com/ running for governor. With bumper stickers like ""My Governor is a Jewish Cowboy"" and ""May the God of Your Choice Bless You."" 
Funny. I also saw this trans maybe? Fella in drag with a rack who may also live on the streets...who sometimes runs for mayor? Hahaa. Awsome.

I think Chris and I really run Mike and Spen down a bit with all the drinkin and going out, Mike more so I think. I feel bad, but I don't. It was worth it. Good times. Great vacation.

We went other places. Saw pretty things. Walked around a whole bunch in different areas. I could go on and on...more than I have. I have a lot of pictures. I'll post them eventually. For real.

Other things. Life. Yahda. Yahda. Yahda.  (Yahda = hebrew for to ""have thorough knowledge of"" or ""to know"" in the sense ""had sexual relations with"" like ""Bobby KNOWS Whitney"". I learned that at a Bible workshop at a gay conference that I attended for free cause I was technically the photographer for the Housatonic newspaper. I'll talk about that next entry.)

"event","So, I think it's official that birthday season is almost over. Well, almost. 
I define birthday season starting right after Christmas ending right about mid/late March. The pinnacle, of course, being my birthday on the 1st of Feb. Bottom line, I've found that I know a lot of people with a winter birthday in this time frame, really if you think about it, for people to be born in this time frame they would have to be conceived from April, May to the begining-ish of June. Spring time, like when the little hibernating bunnies and squirrels rub their little bunny/squirrel eyes and then start humpin like it was makin them money. We as humans feel warm weather, rub our little human eyes, start going back outside into the world more then start fornicating all in sight. I don't know. Thats what I figure, but hey, this is just my theory. So I say, anyone with a birthday in this time frame is awsomer than all others, unless you suck. Then you just suck no matter when you were born. Or, if you happen to be awsome and not born in this time frame, that's ok too. Unless you suck.

So, Cristina's birthday was the 11th of Feb. I can't go into ALL the details, but let me say, that was the most difficult and aggravating surprise birthday planning ever. I really don't think she could have made things more difficult if she tried. Main focal points, there was gonna be lots of food for her. It's what she loves so thats what we got her. Rob got her two flank steak pinwheels, I got her a filet mignon, a phatty one from Stew Leonords. Tory bought all these smackerals of treats. There was oven cooked pizzas. The works. 
Late the night right before....the bitch breaks a tooth at the casino and can't eat anything. !!!! Whole party ""hey look at this lovely food we got you. Too bad you can't eat, so just sit and watch everyone else. Happy Birthday!!"" We were having trouble getting her out of the house. Also, not to mention that night was the night we got the blizzard.
In the end it got better where she could eat some. Got a good amount of people to still make it despite the blizzard. The End.

So, it's T-minus....less than a week before I depart for Texas. Oh yeah, Austin. It's barely sinkin in. I'm prob not gonna pack till the last minute. I think I'm ignoring the fact that I'm going to have to get on a plane. Not that I have some big fear, hell, I've jumped out of two before. It's just...uncomfortable. I don't enjoy it at all. Can't sit still for that long, can't fall asleep. Turbulence. Crap. Suck. Babies.

Oh, well. My time is up here. 
Here, as in, this entry.

"event","Oh dandy dandy. Well, I have a little internet breathing room so I figure an update may be something of interest...for me. 

Lets just start from last week-ish, shall I? Shall.

Last week or (lets pretend that since it's only Monday I mean two weeks ago, cause thats what I mean to mean) I attended concert. Which would be: Golgo Bordello, Tegan and Sara & Cake. Correct. That was the entire line up...to one show. I know. When I saw that, I bought tickets on presale cause it blew my fucking mind. Thompson attended with me cause I knew he'd be down. I drove early into Boston, we walked around during the day then drove to Worcester, cause that's where it was. Man. I couldn't imagine what kind of fans it would bring. Those three bands, I think, are really nothing alike and have nothing in common other than that I think they're all great. Mainly Cake fans of course, but each band had a few of their own, that's for sure. Even though all three were absurd and awsome, I felt kinda bad for Tegan and Sara. Golgo Bordello...is insane. Seriously. There is nothing calm, mild or mundane about them. They're considered ""Gypsy Punk"" for the love of god. Then, again, it was mainly Cake fans, so I think for most people there, Golgo and T&S were just merely what they seemed...openers for Cake. Golgo is so insane, so roudy live that even if you've never heard of or seen them before, it's near impossible to only half watch them and I'd take the liberty of saying they've most likely rocked every house they've ever been in. People loved them. Then...there was Tegan and Sara, at a completely opposite speed following. I think to some they were just two girls with guitars. I must admit, the sound there wasn't the best and I enjoyed them more last time I saw them at Toads place. Never the less, there were some fans for them there and I still totally dug it.
Then Cake. Some kid threw the green end of a pineapple and hit the singer in the face. Yeah. Bizarre. My favorite part of their set was, of course, the almost two minutes of audience participation for ""sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell, sheep go to heaven, goats, go to hell"" cause really, who can't love that.

Another highlight, that Saturday I got to reap the Christmas present given to me by Jeanne. We went into NY and saw RENT. Walked around the city all day towards no particular destination, and let me tell you, we lucked out on the weather hard. It was that Saturday where it felt like summer, I walked around with only half my jacket on, as in, one sleeve on, the other half hangin out the strap of my shoulder bag. It was supposed to rain that day too and never did. We found some joint and got some sushi then went over to see the show. Without saying, it was above super. As I was reading through the bill on all the thespians that would be playing each role, I learned two things this time. A) Apparently everyone can get a role on Law & Order cause like 5 of the thespos in that certain cast of RENT all had it noted in their bios. I guess when you think about it, for every episode they need a new killer and a new victim so... B) The actress playing this ""Mimi"" is actually also the voice of Virgin Mobile. I happen to have Virgin Mobile and have had for years. Everytime I call for whatever reason, they have this uppity pre-recorded chick who helps navigate you through their phone system in such a hip manner that only Virgin Mobile can supply for it's young, hippity hipster customers. I thought it was interesting and it was nice to finally put a face to that hippity voice.  You know, not as hippity when she sings though. Very nice.

I'm running out of internet breathing room...so for last...
this past Thursday I got a surprise birthday party. Yeah, was some surprise, especially since my birthday isn't till this Weds. Ha. I can't believe I had no idea of it coming. It was good timing on their part. Cristina and Rob's lease is up on the 1st of February (which is my birthday) so last Thurs. would be that last Thurs. for them in the apartment so Cristina said she wanted to have everyone over to watch The O.C. for the last time in the place, which is something completely normal for us all to do. So I kick about all day, then Jeanne and I went to Target before the venture over to Cris and Rob's. I knew something was up cause Jeanne would keep disappearing from me to use her phone, I suspected, while we were shopping. I thought it a little strange, but if anything, any part of me that did think it had to do with my birthday, I didn't think it was going to happen almost a week before it. Also, that fact that they made me think I was coming over to watch The O.C. was a good way to make sure that I'd be on time, cause well.....ha.
I walk in and bam....they have everyone squeezed into the kitchen all surprise like with the light switch flip and all. They was like, at least 15 people there. There was even a present table, like, people got me gifts and shit. Then, like moms do, they made me sit in a chair in front of everyone and open them. You'd think I was getting a double ended dildo or something. To everyone surprise, it was just some Prilosec, you know, acid reflux medication. Ha. Seriously, that was cool. I needed it and I think Cristina's one of the only people who would actually think to buy me that and put it in a bag with tissue paper and give it to me for my birthday. I got silly stringed. People gave me wine and I drank it. They also had a cake made for me. Some time last year someone took a picture of me bent over with my finger in my mouth as Rob pretended to be delivering me a ""shark bite"" or some know it as ""the shocker""...yeah, Cristina brought that picture to Stop & Shop and had them put it on a cake. Trust. Hahaa.
It was super rad. Mucho. This year I'm also getting to celebrate my birthday 3 times!!! It's incredible. 1st, the surprise party. Then, my actually birthday where friends and I will go to East to have sushi (aka: like when I take your mom out to a nice seafood dinner and never call her again...har) which anyone reading this may attend, then, Superbowl Sunday at my house will be a triple threat party. Since Johnny's birthday and mine are only like 10 days apart, my mom always combines are party cause it's easier, plus, the super bowl also falls around the same time, so its a ""Super Bowl XL, Happy Birthday Johnny, Happy Birthday Carla"" party. Small family gathering, few friends, lots of food. Fun.

Ok, so my time is up. 

Awsome go funk go crazy. RRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrRRRRRRRRRRR.

Christmas.
I gotta say, as far as gifts go, this year was incredibly ridiculous. I recieved some incredible stuff from my friends.
For starters, Jeanne got me tickets to see RENT in NY for January. She's covering all of it, the train and everything. I'm psyched. My favorite THING ever. It never gets old. And in case you were wondering if tickets would go up after they made a movie....boy did they ever.
I heard she was spending a couple bucks on me so I had to get something equally awsome, so I got her a turtle for Christmas. That hippie's wanted one for a while. His name is Beeker. He's a red-eared slider and has everything a turtle could want to be a happy turtle. He lives with fish too. But only till he eats them.
Then, speaking of plays, Cristina's also getting me tickets to see Moving Out when it comes around here some time in March.
Rob got me a beginners accordion. This may sound strange, but I actually wanted it. Some people (Cristina) hated Rob for getting me that gift during our special Christmas dinner we all had at their house. Then again, Cristina should hate me as well because she's the one who lives with him and I'm the one partially responsible for getting Rob a chainsaw for Christmas, but I take all the blame. ;) Anyways, I left some people a good Christmas voice mail this year. Awsome.
Thompson got me these two awsome ""books"" by Alan Martin, they guy who created Tank Girl (also is the guy who drew all the characters for the Gorillaz, the band, you know). I think it's funny, but not surprising that we each got each other comic books for Christmas. So about these ""books"", Chris knows  how much I like Tank Girl and that I've slowly but surely been trying to collect all the comics of every series, then he came across these. The first one is just 8.5X11 paper with a colored cover folded in half and stapled, but it's all the Tank Girl stories, ideas and drawings that Alan Martin wrote that never made it to print and was afraid would never see the light of day. So, he got them printed. It's signed and numbered by him in the back cover. The other ""book"" follows the same lines of the other book as it's on 8.5x11 paper with a color cover, except this one apparently he printed and made right at his house and this one is actually more of a Tank Girl short novel he wrote. This one though was personalized for me and came staight from his house in the UK right to mine (after hitting Chris's first). Chris had him sign ""To Carla. Meow. Alan Martin."" It's number 19 of only like 500 and something of them. Hahahaa. I'm pretty confident most understand that. It's gotten to the point Chris and I answer the phone like that and barely acknowledge it anymore.
Also, I know I haven't mentioned it publically on the internet in a while, but I still love the cats on more a of a less legal level, except for Creep, who I still secretly wish dead, but in a loving manner. So my favrite picture I took of them, black and white fighting in front of a window. Very ""art noir"", Cait got it put on a t-shirt and it says ""bitches get stitches"" above it and gave it to me for Christmas. HA. Oh man. Great.
Then, my moms got me a sweet photo printer. Epson Stylus. Mid-grade. Between other family and brother, I got a nice amount of gift cards to Best Buy and Circuit City which I'm sure I'll so great things with.
AND THEN, so last year Thompson was really poor and couldn't get me anything for my birthday or Christmas, which was fine by me, I didn't hold it against him. When such a frugal bastard like Thompson is broke, it ain't no joke. So he tells me that to make up for that and for my current birthday coming up real soon, he wants to pay for all my air fare to go to Austin, TX for 5 days in mid/late March.
I know! He asked me if that was something I'd be interested in doing with him and I said ""Hell, yeah."" Why Austin, TX? Well for starters, duh, now that Dave Novak, Melanson AND Spen are now all officially down there, we can hang with them homies. Also, just for the hell of it, we're going to plan the trip so we're there during South By Southwest ( http://2006.sxsw.com ) , not that we'll nessisarily get into anything during it or whatnot, but the city will be pretty hoppin at that time we figure so it should just be fun.

What an awsome Christmas. I am kinda glad all that hustle and bustle of the holiday season is done.  Like I can relax somewhat. Of course, I'm broke like no joke from it. I didn't even pay December's car insurance or student loans yet. Slowly but surely I know I'll get back on my feet, but I also know I'll be too busy having so much fun while I'm doing it. Radical.

<strike>Looks like</strike> New Years is at Thompson's.

Oh yeah, and today is Rob's birthday. I believe he's now 24 going on 13. I don't know, whatever age where you stop wetting the bed or if you still do you should be ashamed, that's the age he is.
So find him and tell him something nice today, tomorrow you can go back to tampon tagging his truck. 

(Yesterday we all went to TK's for his birthday dinner cause he has to work today on his birthday. Full of meat and beer.)

Back to work.

Annnnnnnd hooooooow."

So, I always say how I have to go through all the pictures I take. I go out somewhere, take a few pictures then I just load em onto my laptop and leave em there and then I fall behind. Well now, now...my laptop has run out of harddrive space. A few months ago I completely restored it. Wiped it clean, theres close to nothin on it, it hasn't even been connected to the internet once. And now it's full of pictures. I even have a disk I burned of pictures I didn't go through yet that I had to burn just so I could empty my camera on it. Insane.
So I'll put all these under the cut for the most part cause theres a lot of pictures. 

These pictures are from April I believe. It was when B and I went up to Boston to house sit for a friend for a few days.

<lj-cut text=""Moo"">
Now story time. These pictures of the burnt church. So when I worked at JP Licks in Boston, it was usually a pretty crowded place and when I would get a break I would prefer to leave the building and just sit somewhere quiet. I would go not even a block down and go down this side street between the post office and some unitarian church, I don't know, some weird church.
Almost every day I would go down a bit, sit on this curb facing the church, eat my free banana and smoke a couple cigarettes and look at the side of this building. The side of the church, it had a face in it. Not an intentional one, like a robot looking one in the structure. There's a picture. Anyways, this was my quiet alone time for each day. Good days, bad days, me and that side of the church went through some shit together. That was my church. It really could have been any building, whatever was there would have been ""my building"", it just happen to be some weird church.
So bout a year ago there was some electrical fire and it burnt down, taking part of the post office with it, so me and B went to go check it out.
They eventually completely redid the post office eliminating my curb and as far as I know the church is still there all burnt up. I assume they're going to completely take it down, but I haven't heard otherwise.

This was the face on the church I would look at. It was on all sides. I know, doesn't seem like a kind, warming character, but I think he was. This next picture is what I more saw him like. He reminds me of Edwardo from ""Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends"". Big and scary looking, but really, just a big pussy.

B knew that I had a soft spot for this particular church, so not till the car ride later did I find out that right before I took this very picture he had stuck his little arm through a  broken window to ""aquire"" me something to remember it by. We get in the car...""I got you a present.""

It was this clown made of shells and pipe cleaners. Listen, you bet is just as good as mine as to what that was doing in a church, but....whatever. I still have it. That was nice of him.

In front of the impromptu temporary post office, there was what looked like a random piece of brick wall on a stand on the sidewalk, which I later found out it was the begining of a new post office sign. So I took a bitchin picture of B in front of a random piece of brick wall. I later made alterations, which as I was making them only further proved that I crack myself up more than anyone else, as in, I'm stupid.

"event","I think it appropriate that I will make this update during a time when I am eager to jump and huddle into my fluffed bed. In other words, I'm kinda tired and hopefully this should work in your favor as I won't create a novel here.
So...hmmm. 
Starbucks.
There is a science to it. I would have already done the chemical breakdown myself, but my exploritory lab is under quarentine for lysteria. I was helping Cristina bottle up a bunch of it from old hot dogs. There is some truth in that story actually.
Anyways, so a weekend or 2 or so ago while I was in Boston, I followed my friends into a Starbucks at least twice, maybe three times. Seeing I don't really drink coffee and if I do, I haven't been to a Starbucks in...an unrecorded amount of longly time. So in a short span of a weekend, 2 or 3 times is a shit load. And each time I went, I also got me a small refreshment of the latte persuation. Pumpkin Spice, Gingerbread, Toffee...these flavors please me.
Then, after returning to CT, sans Thompson cause he lives there but he's the one who fronted the Starbucks missions each time....I find myself desiring more.
Within 8 days after, including what I had in Boston, I probably visited a Starbucks a total of 6 times. I was unaware the exact whereabouts of all Starbucks in my area cause I never go, so I brought other friends along, friends who do drink coffee regularly. I had a small (not tall) latte drink from Starbucks a whopping 6 times in about 8 days! Here's the kicker. I can't have caffeine. I DRINK DECAF!!!!
I am surrounded by friends and family that drink coffee everyday and yes they like it, but they all tell me it's for the caffeine, a waker upper. So why, why me, who drinks decaf, why did I need this 6 times in 8 days?!?
I don't know man. No seriously, I even hit up the Starbucks in the Target next to my house. WT-motha fuckin-F.
Fear not though, It was a short stint. I haven't had one in about 2 weeks. And really, I think I substituted that addiction with wine.
Which is another story. Ha.
So, cause of acid reflux, I can't really drink wine. It liek hurts the worst. I finally went on Prilosec OTC for 14 days and I was invinsable. In those 1 days, I prob drank 10 bottles of wine. And over 3 this weekend.

This wonderful holiday week. 
It was great. Old folks were all comin into town for the holiday. Jasmine (of J&B), Thompson, Melanson, Ashley from the LA, Ryan Cyr...bunch-o folks. 
Monday was Melanson's first day back so that night shit load of people packed into New West for wings, beer and darts. It was so shitty out but everyone came...including all the fratties from Southern, but good game. Good game.
Tuesday, we were rockin' the Jazz Ma (that's funny right??). I picked up Jasmine from her folks house and we met up with Cristina and Cait at TK's for wing night. Later Rob and Jamie joined. Beer and delicious wings. Best wings ever. Or until someone shows me otherwise. I ate too many. Swell.
Weds. I don't remember that day. What did I do that day? I did somethin. All I remember is coming home at like 4am and it was snowing. For real snowing. And for some reason more at my house. Everything was covered. All the trees. It was so pretty. There was like already 2 inches on the ground and still comin. I got a scarf and boots and Jeanne and I walked down my street in it and I took pictures, cause first snow is the best snow. The next morning, the sun took care of everything. You would have never guessed there was so much snow on the ground just hours before. But I saw it. Fo shiz.
Thurs. Turkey day. I made my house the house for people who not nessisarily didn't have anywhere else to go, but didn't really want to go there. Thompson, She' and Jeanne ate with my family, later joined by Rob and Jamie (seeing a pattern here. Them fuckers are always late. Cause they're fuckin. Mmmhmm.)
That night was a big old party at Cristina's and Rob's. All folks came. Jasmine too. I....was shit faced. I don't know how much I drank, but I can safely say it was at least two bottles of wine. I rarely get that shit faced anymore. Really, I did it for Jasmine, cause that's how she remembers me. I'd get loaded at my apartment in Boston, then stumble over to the Midway as she was working the door. Then I'd continue to drink more. But, then again, at the Midway she never got to witness me and Thompson drunk playing guitar and singing. It's a famous drunk past time for us. Though, I should probably be embarassed. I barely remember, but... I don't think I am.
I was pretty loud mouthed. Somewhere near the end of the night, I wanted a nap away from everyone so Rob was already in his room sleeping, so I stumbled in, got in his sofa chair, pulled up the back cushion and put it on top of me. Rob heard russleing later and came over cause he thought I was a cat or dog, but all he saw were feet sticking out. I heard him walk and just stop and stand over me confused. I then moved the cushion off my face and body and just put my finger to my mouth ""Shhhhhhhhhh....""  He didn't say anything, turned around and went back to bed. Hahaa.
Oh yeah, Weds I went and saw RENT with Jazz-Ma, Cristina, Jeanne and Cait. I can't even get into that. I know I'll say too much. But what I can say is, being the brat that I am and having seen it like 9 times, I was ready to be disappointed to a degree. It was way better than I thought it would be. I recommend, but then again, it would have had to be really bad for me to not like it, cause I like RENT so much. It's like one of my favorite THINGS ever.
Friday. Gathering at Jill's. Later in the night someone whipped out boxing gloves and there were matches in the backyard. Thompson got whooped by Johnny U. When I say whooped, like, we needed to give him a ride home, not cause he was drunk, but cause he got hit in the head so hard he couldn't see straight. He loved it though, laughed the whole time.
Sat. Gathering at Helwigs. Bunch of people. Beers. Darts. Fun. Thompson got 3 consecutive darts in the bullseye. One of my games, I got two consecutively in. I never done that before. This was my best game ever:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v59/vsvictrolavs/mydartsgame.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
BAM!!! I'm ""Something Witty"" to the right. To the left is ""Lady Lumps"" which was Carrie. Fuckin BAM!!! Not cause Carrie was nessisarily that bad, I just was so killer that game. KILLER!!
Ashley from the LA was there that night. Props to LA Ashley!! ::props::. 
Sunday, I slept.

Ok, so much for not being long. So much.

So much."

"event","So, the art opening.

First, thanks to anyone on here who helped me pick out the photos. And really, thanks to everyone who came by. All my friends were so supportive, in general. Even friends I don't see regularly and ones that didn't get a chance to come by, they were all very eager to talk to me about it and kindly commending.
Honestly, sometimes I think I had the most guests come by more than any other artist there. I mean, it is a small gallery that not that many people know of, but still. My friends and the people I know are friggin great.
So I was given a good amount of wall area. I had 22 photos on display. Split in two sections. Photos of Pleasure Beach and photos of Holyland, USA. I had background bios printed out for each area. And...the bio for myself. Yeah, I took that in a light-hearted manner. Anyone who read it was amused. Let me see if I have a copy of it on this computer....yeah, I do...
<small><i>- Carla Lia -
Bio:
     Born and raised in southern Connecticut, Carla has been very successful in living for a steady twenty-three years and counting. Sometimes as a congratulatory treat, she will eat ice cream.

Passively enjoys the color red. Aggressively dislikes taper-legged jeans.

Fact: Carla has a cadavers tendon in her left knee and has jumped out of a moving plane at 14,000 feet. Twice.

Note: These two facts are completely unrelated.

At a very young age Carla developed the skills to make any martial arts weapon known to man out of nothing but sticks, electrical tape and string.
MacGyver was also very popular at that time, so no one cared.

Contrary to popular belief, Carla does believe in life after Dance Dance Revolution. Even at 2AM on a warm summers night wearing only underwear.

Also, a photographer.
...</small></i>

Yeah, that was followed by a more serious, heart-felt quote of mine about why I like to take and show photos. Tear jerking really, I'll spare you.

So for the reception, I thought I'd be thoughtful and bring a bottle of wine. I even bought a nice one, one that I think is really good...it's something french and queer...Boujelous Village? Pronounce it all french like. It's one of my favorite wines and I can't even spell it. Anyways, so I get there. I pour B a glass, pour Julia a glass and one for myself and put it down. In under 4 mins the whole bottle was gone. I learned, next time just buy the cheap wine. Someone was smart and hid most of the bottles and periodically brought them out. These people drink wine like it's their job...maybe it is? I also learned there's also those strange, homely people that soley come for the free crackers and wine. Hahaa.

So for starters, I was the youngest ""artist"" there. Second to me, there was this girl who had a small photo exhibit who was 33. She was cool. I actually hung with her a lot at the gallery and she told me a lot of interesting things. Ex: Where to get an acupuncture session for only 35 bucks. Which I will do some day.
Judging (which was dumb of me) some paintings at the end of the gallery, by the looks of them I thought at first the artist must be young. Like possibly even younger than me. The quality and things that were painted. There was even a maybe 12x18 canvas that was painted completely black. Just black. It was titled ""brain"" and had a price tag of $700. (B, if you're reading this and you can, you should post the picture you took of that painting).  What was more interesting to me was that all the other paintings of actual...things the artist painted, were being sold for half that price, so I wanted to meet the person who made them and ask them about the ""brain"" painting cause I was really curious in how it came to be. The third day in I finally saw the artist by her paintings talking to someone about them. She was not as young as I had though. About 40 years-old. I was going to approach her and chat about her work, but looking at the way she was talking to other people and her posture, she seemed like the type who would get very offended if I questioned her work in any manner. So I decided I didn't need to know that bad. Ha!
Artists are so funny.
So yeah. During the reception, which is when the most random people came in, a lot of people would walk by and look at my photos. Some people would converse and point and look at them together and make comments and talk about them. Seeing the nature of the gallery and that all the other art was by older, professional and aspiring to be artists, I think people assumed that these photos were from one as well. Not everyone reads the bio, hell I was there all weekend and I didn't even read everyones bio, so as I was standing a few feet away talking with my friends I wondered what people would think if they knew that the kid standing right next to them was the person that took those photos, if they'd like them as much. Yeah, I know. They probably would. Really, I don't think my age matters as much as I sound like I think it does. I think I just  expected more kids there. A lot of my interaction with art and artists was while I was in Boston, and Boston is...well, all college kids and with the people I seemed to be around, almost every one of them was ""a motha fuckin ahhhtist"" of some kind. I kinda of expected it to be the same way.
So while people were looking and talking about my photos, part of me felt like I was supposed to introduce myself and talk about the photos with them....but I didn't want to. The bios were on the wall, the photos were there, I felt there was no need to be intrusive while they're viewing. If they wanted to know more or had a question, they would find me. Plus, I was enjoying feeling somewhat incognito. I SO BADLY wanted to walk up to someone standing there looking at a photo of mine, come up behind them and say something like ""Yeah, I think this one completely blows. I hear the photographer's a total head case. What a mess."" and walk away. Hahaahaa.
But all in all, the whole opening weekend went just fine. They're was live music now and then to keep me entertained when all else failed (by the way, one night after the gallery hours, everyone went downstairs to watch this guy called Wild Bill Firehands play piano accompanied by prerecorded guitar and drums. It was sick....cause the last song, the guy literally lights his hands on fire and plays the piano. FUCKIN SIIIICK!!!). I made friends with a lot of the people there. We talked all weekend about tons of stuff. I've already been emailing with a couple people I met there, one is actually this painter's son who has great interest in the history and restoration of Pleasure Beach so we've been researching it together and emailing articles. Cool. I even got a couple fans. These two women liked my photos so much they found the gallery owner and asked to meet me. It was nice. 
I even got some feedback from this other photographer there. The Monday after the opening I went to take my stuff off the wall and this guy walked in and said ""Hey, so you're the young photographer..."" and he talked with me for about 20 minutes. I told him which photos of his I really liked, he he told me the same. He told me, not that it's a bad thing and that he even has it in his photos, that in photographs, especially anything close to landscapes, there's a barrier between the photographer and the subject he's taking. That you can see in a photo the relationship between the photographer and the land and theres a distant space between them, but he said that I don't have that and he thinks it's great. That I get very up into it in an intimate way without being disruptive. My photos show that I'm curious.
I think I know what he means. I always notice that I really like getting in close on things. I love macro lenses and I always want a way to zoom even closer and I ALWAYS tend to try to have a very short depth of field, I usually want to use the lowest F-stop on my camera I can, like what I'm focusing on is clear and everything else fades to blur. I've always loved that.
Anyways, that was that. I actually might participate in a smaller opening at the end of this month till the end of December. Not like this one. More of I have a section to place photos and they just stay there on display all month.
I'm also painting a 55 gallon oil drum that will be used as a trash can in Park City, Bridgeport. Ha. They had a few there to take. If anyones interested, anyone can do it. They give you the drum for free, you just have to prime and paint it however you want. Just has to be ok for the public. You know, no obvious vaginas or anything. You just contact this guy and then go pick the drum up, then drop it off the first week of December. Pretty sweet.

Ok, that will be all. I'm late to go back out to work again.
DERP.

The sizes are all different for no particular reason. There's a whooole bunch of em. Just gotta do this kinda quick as I'm nearing my final cut probably by the end of Weds.

"event","So, this weekend I will be showing in the open studios at an art gallery in Bridgeport.

And I have no idea what I'm doing.

I've only known for sure kinda of recently. I had known it was coming up and I had submitted an application weeks ago, but I was waiting for word because I wasn't sure if there was any room left or I had been accepted or whatnot.
So yes and yes. And now I'm kind of buggin out on a fraction of a level...cause, I kinda don't know what the hell I'm doing.
Really, it's not that huge of a deal. It's going to be at The Nest Art Gallery, the one that I had talked about visiting with Rob few months ago.
It's a semi-new gallery and studios they built in an old factory building along 95 in Bridgeport. It's not very big and not very heard of as far as I know, but still, it's probably going to bring some real great and dedicated artists and for some reason I feel like I may be the only kid there. Last time I went it was all middle-aged men who worked or had their art there. Then there's gonna be me. Some snot-nosed kid who got a digital camera on sale at Target and a pirated copy of Photoshop 7 off the internet. I know, it may not be really like that, but seriously, it's also not too far from the truth at all either and it bothers me a bit.
Now, I basically know what I'm doing in the sense of what I'll show. I think it's gonna be split of two locations. Abandoned Pleasure Beach and Holyland USA in Waterbury. None of these photos are on the internet execpt for the ones I took from the first visit to Pleasure Island. But yeah, I still don't know which photos yet. I have to figure that out tonight for the most part.
But all the other stuff, ??? like the simple things about being part of a gallery opening. I don't know. Am I supposed to dress up? Are my photos supposed to have a theme? Am I supposed to frame and matte them all in the same way? (Which, I don't know and doesn't matter because I don't have the money for frames at all so I'm just going to put them on mattes and hang them like that. I have no choice. I have no money.) Do people do that? Seeing this place is small and maybe a bit poor, am I supposed to bring wine, like a nice gesture? Or is that weird? Are these not wine people? Am I supposed to have something to represent myself? What the hell am I representing myself as anyways? Which brings me to this...
I got a group email from the guy to all of us telling us we should have a printed out biography so people know who the artist is. A biography? I don't have one! I never did anything like this before. I figure someone's biography would be like: "" Attended blah blah school with a BA in sculpture. Then blah blah for a BA in Liberal Arts. Showed radda radda pieces on display at blah blah gallery in NY. Had laddi laddi pieces accepted into Crappity Crap museum of crap in Hoboken. Have art for sale at www.buymybeautifulshit.com....etc.""
And I have none of that of any kind. I went to a communications school for Radio Broadcasting, I can't even put that, it has no relevance really. So what else do I got? I'm 23. I like the color red. I've been working on filling a large tupperware container of my photos mostly developed by Walmart and I just love Dance Dance Revolution MAX2!
?????!? I just don't know what I'm supposed to write.
And obviously, I have to be present for the entire weekend opening and I have to stand next to my stuff the whole time. I'm worried people will might ask me questions and I'll have nothing solid to say other than what the photos are of. Granted I can bullshit and talk a lot, but other than this one opening, I have nothing else to talk about. I'm really bad at trying to hold conversations about art. I just fucking like it! I know what I like and I know what I don't. I appreciate every piece even when I think it's crap and I love hearing stories about them and how they came to be and why they were made and all that good stuff, but thats the thing, I like being a listener than any kind of ""critiquer"" at all. I've got no facts, I just know what I like and express it in the most standard forms because I think ""art"" is too bigger than all of us for me to even try and mess with words of explanation for the most part.
Ahh anyways. I'm also not sure how many people will actually show. I know it's a small place, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it will be hoppin, who knows.  
Also, in the details of the opening it says something about all pieces sold must stay up till the end of the showing... I never thought about anyone buying anything of mine. I thought I was just showing. In the event that someone does ever want to buy one, I don't know how much to charge. It's just gonna be a print digitally printed out on glossy photo paper on a matte. And I'm representing them as prints I think, in the sense that it is not a one and only. I am willing to sell them and reprint them over and over. I don't know how that holds water. 

I don't know, all I do know is that I'm doing it and you should come.
I know I and everything will be fine. I just had to get that out.

In November Stratford will elect it's first mayor...I think, ever. 

Rob was talkin about it, then my older brother got all ""Vote or DIE"" about it cause well....hmphh.

But here's some info on that.

http://www.townofstratford.com/townclerk/MayoralCandidates.htm
That's got all of them with their own websites, but that Carroll fella doesn't have one. He must not be hip then. Ehh well, Stratford is home to a fuck load of elderly folk and they just think the internet is an absorbent layer in the compound fabric of Depends anyways.

http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15394808&BRD=1637&PAG=461&dept_id=9180&rfi=6
These are from the debates they had so you can see how SMAAHHHT they are.


I wonder if things will change for the town if we actually have a mayor. If now since people will actually have someone specific to look towards when somethings wrong, they'll feel more obligated to do so. In change, if there's a clearer target to point a finger and they know that, that things will actually get done. Not that I think Stratford has a lot wrong to it or needs immediate help...but hell, it'd be nice if SOMEONE got their shit together and put Shakespeare Theatre back in operation. You know, they've only talked about it for about literally a friggin decade and even put attractions signs up on the highways and then did not a thing to it and never re-opened it.

Or, we could get a mayor and life goes on as it always did and no one notices after about 2 months. 

Who's Milford's mayor? I want that guy. I want to live in the nations largest amount of porn stores per capita and I want Girls Gone Wild to visit my local town's bars.
Nah forget it. I don't mind living a town over actually. It's better this way. You don't wanna ""sleep where you screw"", I guess. It'd be like kicking off your shoes in a peep show booth. I favor the clearance and a clean bed.

But I kid, I kid. I like Milford. Porn."

So I'm back at the abode at an early hour for once this molton. I believe I will start with a show recap from the past week. Oh man, I wish I could like, make a montage. I already did. IN MY HEAD. ha. no.
Well, so I've been going to crazy shows cause it's concert season. I've also been in Boston at Thompson's for one reason or another every weekend for like the past month. So much as I left my bar soap in the medisine cabinet so I'd always have it there. So this weekend I'll actually stay in CT and I'm am getting my ass DRUNK, skunk style. At a gathering. With other people. Like, more than two. I haven't drank with lots of other people since like...the party after the first time I went sky diving. In fact, I really haven't been wasted in a good while. 
Any who how.
So, last weekend.
Last weekend was Zolof the Rock and Roll Destroyer in Boston with B, Julia Gulia, Nicky C and Thompson. I think I may have mentioned this. I don't care. Yeah, so it was super sweet. I enjoyed it a lot. I even ended up with one of the drummer's broken drum sticks. Also, Zolof is gonna have a new album and apparently they were talkin to one of the Blink 182 boys who had interest in them and said he wanted to produce their next album. So I'm assuming this mean they'll get on a pretty sweet label. I think it's all great. Work out well for them. But yeah, the rest of the weekend was all gravy too. One night me and Nicky C walked around Mass Ave. all into Cambridge fuckin around and takin photos and just walkin all over till 4:30 in the morning. We saw some strange stuff. It was excellent weather. So excellent, I bought a Slurpee. THEN, I bought another. I know. Tell me about it!

<lj-cut text=""Yes, I know dears. This is hella long per usual. It's my journal, I can do whatever I want. At least I'm trying to be considerate with a cut. I do it cause I love you, people. I LEARNED IT FROM WATCHING YOU!!! Hahahaa. If you don't like music or comic books, I wouldn't bother reading cause that's all I rambled about in this one. I did give Tegan and Sara 'daps' though and told them 'Good game. Nice hustle.' It's in there. "">
Back to shows. So got back Sunday. Then Monday I went to see Dar Williams at Toads. I can never have anything negative to say about any show of hers. It was great. The crowd wasn't huge which was awsome, lots of space. No neck breathing. I love her stories, even the one's I've heard 10 times before. ""What is art? Who am I?"" That never gets old to me. Ever. And even when she plays sad songs that melt your face, it's still ok, cause you know she's not really upset about it. There's no dwelling. She's in the middle of a show and next she's just gonna play some song where she bounces a lot. Plus, however many times I've seen her, I've never heard her play ""February"" which is, I think, her mother load of melting you right into the floor. I think it's beautiful, it's just hard to take.
And Weds. Weds. 
Weds. I went back to Toads Place to see Our Lady Peace. Listen, I love them. I do. I still so. And this was not a terrible terrible show, but...it wasn't the greatest either. Their last album was so kick ass. The guys a freak and he screams and means it and shakes all over the place. Something you can make a fist to in a non-violent manner. The new album. There are some songs that if it weren't for his voice I don't think I would have guessed it to be Our Lady Peace. I admit, I do need to give the album more time. There are a few songs on it I know I dig. But for the most part, it's lacking in the rock department comparitively. If you enjoy the mellow-er songs, then you'd probably love it. SO...the show itself. They played a very long set. Lots of songs. They even played their ""last song"" then we waited for the inevitable encore and they came out and played like another 6 songs. It was sick. Now out of all these songs, they only played all their singles, plus one other song on an old album, which may have been a single, I don't know...the entire rest of the set was basically the new album. That's it. The new album, and those few singles that everyone knows. I give this show one thumb up and the other in a jar of peanut butter, where it's clearly not supposed to be, but there are far worse places to stick a thumb.
Then Fri and Sat I was back in Boston. No concerts...but...Wizards Boston Comic Convention. Oh I'm not ashamed or feel dorky at all. I was psyched and had a great time, but let's be honest. These events bring some interesting kids and middle aged men for that matter. I over heard some serious ""D&D, Magic, level 7 sword, my internet girlfriend, I'm having a Star Wars themed wedding"" conversations. For example, when walking by a few boys I caught drift of a conversation they were having about some girl where I heard ""...so if her ass is square, X, funtion symbol..."" WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN?!?! Square, X, function symbol?!?! Seriously, it's like ""If it weren't for my horse, I would have never spent that year in college.."" you hear it and it just blows your mind and you can't stop thinking about it. Come on, I just could not figure it out. My only thing was that it was related to a computer game somehow? like square and X are both Playstation buttons and function symbol? Maybe that's something on a key board?! I don't know man. I don't. fucking. know
Anyways, the convention was awsome. The best part was all the artists, old and brand new. Everyone was drawing. If I had more money I would have bought more prints. They're was a lot of great stuff. And EVERYONE was siging autographs for EVERYONE. I met the creator of the movie SAW and he signed a book for me. The guy who used to draw Silver Surfer, Warlock among a shit load of others, Jim Starlin, signed an old Silver Surfer comic I got for 50cents for me. One of the guys who does Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I bought one of his awsome, new age Ninja Turles prints, it's all red and gray and he signed it for me. There's this artist Skottie Young ( http://www.skottieyoung.com ) who I totally dig. If you look under gallery, Misc. there's this one called ""Camel"" which really is just like his version of Tank Girl. I loved it. So I bought it and he signed it for me. There was this other artist named RAK who did all these little prints of already animated even more animated super heros and what not he was selling for a buck each. Some of them were really cool lookin. He signed em. I bought 2. Also, they make all this stuff specifically for each convention. It's only in about 4 or 5 cities. You know those Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, etc. action figures they made that I love and look so stellar? So for each convention they specifically made one. They made an action figure of Kevin Smith as himself. Just in shorts, a t-shirt, button down smoking a cigarette. Then he pre-signed every single one of em they had. I got one of those too. Yeah, I def did spend more money there than I thought I would, cause really, I thought I prob wouldn't spend more than 10 bucks tops, but really, I didn't even spend that much. Surprisingly, I found that a lot of stuff was really cheap there. Like, lots of nice prints were only 5 bucks and the sign them for free. Not much money, but a shit load of awsome stuff. I just really enjoyed so much stuff there. But yeah, lots of famous artists there, I didn't even know half of them. But I did get to play the new Mortal Kombat game. Sweet.
Alrighty already. 
So Monday. Monday I went back to Toads place with Spen, Jeanne, and Nicky C for Tegan and Sara. Out of this week of shows, I'd probably lean closest with this to say it was the best out of all of them. Every ong was just so right on and rocked for an unrecorded amount of time. And it's fun to watch sisters bicker on stage. It was great cause I was really psyched to see them and Spen fucking loves them, I swear, that kid's at half mass after the first line of any song. He was all teeth the entire time. I'd turn over to smile at him like ""this is at a pretty high level of awsome huh?"" and he's already be smiling all giddy like a school girl. It was just nice to be at a show with someone who's also very happy to be there.
So after the show, the crowd wasn't too huge and Spen being Spen, wanted Tegan and Sara to sign his arms cause they were at the merch booth doing so. So I wait in line with him and we get up there. Spen's chit chattin for a bit, had to show them the tattoo he got of his own name on the side of his finger, then we're leaving and Spens commending them on such a good show and flairing some ""daps"". As I'm leaving I reach in to give them each ""daps"" and tell them ""good game"" with a head nod proceeded by a ""nice hustle."" I'm such an asshole. Hahahahaa. That was awsome.

Ok fine. This is all too much. Eat me.
Good night!</lj-cut>"

"event","Well now.
So this is the part where I talk about the pictures I'm going to be posting, but these pictures of from almost a year ago really. Well, 7 months-ish ago, but somehow that feels like a year. Like it's not even halloween yet and I feel like Christmas is right around the corner and then my 24th birthday. And a year, I can not understand how quick time feels like it's gone by. I cannot believe I've been home for just over a year already. I also cannot believe it's fall again. Didn't that like just happen? About a year ago? Yeah.
I don't know, I think I'm just being time paranoid. I do that now and then. And to top it, I just feel like I haven't sat still for months. Or maybe just a month. Or maybe 5, I don't even know anymore. I feel like I haven't stopped moving, but what the hell have I been doing?!? Seems like a whole lot of everything and a handbasket of nothing at the same time, but that just sounds negative. And I don't think it is. 
Most importantly though, I'm doing fine. Maybe things are taking longer than they should, maybe I freak out from time to time, which I think is completely normal, but I understand whats out of my control and I've been working my best with what I've got. I have nothing to truely complain about. And for some reason I have a really good feeling about next spring. Nothing earth shattering, but I think it'll just be good.

But anyways, back to now. So yeah, it's concert season. I saw Kay Hanley 2 weekends ago in Boston. She played during Brookline's 300th Anniversery deal. Small stage, small crowd. Outdoors. I enjoyed it immensely, though I heart that broad so much I don't think I could ever see her live and be anything close to dissapointed. In fact, I don't even think I've ever hated a single song she's made, remade, or played. Big happy. Then this weekend me, Julia, B and Cousin Nicky C went back up to Boston and Thompson's to see Zolof the Rock and Roll Destroyer. It was ultra rad and I just had a good weekend up there altogether. 
I swear, since Thompson moved back to Boston, I've barely gave that kid a weekend to himself. It's a good thing he enjoys my company. Seeing all these shows and weekends we had planned up there, I asked him when he'd start getting sick of having me there every weekend. He said probably never, then called me a fucking faggot, you know, to even things out.
I went up there with him the entire first weekend he moved (when he didn't have a clock radio). Then I went back up the weekend She' moved up there (with a new clock radio I got him for his birthday), then I was just there this weekend for Zolof. Next weekend, Julia, Me, Thompson and whoever else are going back up to Boston for the Boston Comic Convention. Then, a free weekend in CT, then the next, back up to Boston to see Liz Phair.
Then, tomorrow I'm going to see Dar Williams in New Haven. Then Weds. I'm going to see Our Lady Peace in New Haven. Then, the next week is Tegan and Sara Monday I think. I was asked if I wanted to go see them again in Northampton, but I just can't.
I don't have the money for any of this. There's even more to this list that I'm trying to attend. I even had to turn down Weezer/Foo Fighters, I already have to much on my plate. My boss told me there's no grass growing underneath my feet. When I had some sit down time this week, I posted crap on ebay and old college books on Amazon to try and get money to afford my life for the next month. There's just so much I want to do and no time or money, but I'm really not planning on having that stop me. The only thing I'm worried that I might not be able to do that I wanted to was to go surfing on the Cape this ""summer""(cause it's officially fall). If this is so, it will be the third summer in a row that I have not been able to do it. It had never occured to me that you could actually go surfing in Cape Cod. When I was painting houses, one of my partners was talking about it late in the season. He said he would be happy to take me, but he wasn't sure he'd have time as he was moving to Vermont in under 2 weeks. He ended up not, but I still wanted to go anyways, but at this point it was already halfway in October and everyone else was telling me the water would be too cold. The following summer I was still pretty poor and by the time I thought I might have a couple bucks, I couldn't find anyone who really wanted to go as bad as I did, plus things were just kind of all over the place. This summer, I only recently stopped sky diving for a fucking second and remembered that surfing was something else I wanted to do this summer. B confirmed with me that he would also enjoy a surfing escape for a weekend, but already I'm thinking that the water may be too cold. Every warm day that passes I think to myself ""This was probably the last warm day to go surfing this year."" There's just always been something going on every weekend for like ever. And yes, I do have no money, but if there was any chance of me going this year, it would be that ""free weekend"" I spoke of in 2 weeks, if I magically get money and global warming sits in for an October weekend. It would be nice, but I'm not getting my hopes up.

Mother god, I should be in bed. I haven't even been sleeping as well as I should. Just thinking about this week makes me tired. I just got excited cause as of right now I know Thurs. I can sleep in till my little peepers please.

So.....these pictures. Ha. They're from one of the blizzrds last winter in February. (I've also told myself that I will actually make more time start going through my pictures more before I'm even more behind, if that's possible. I won't let myself look at any new pictures I took till I finish the piles of folders sitting on my laptop.) During the middle of it Rob decides we should go for a drive to the beach. He picked me up and we went to the sea wall. My mother couldn't understand why I would leave the house. I told her it was ok, Rob drove a Silverado. Sarcastically, we both agreed that all other cars and trucks should not be driving during a blizzard, but a Silverado, a Silverado makes you 100% safe for all blizzard mishaps and accidents and is completely unstopable. She didn't find it as funny as I.
We went to the sea wall and would run around outside for two minutes taking pictures till we couldn't feel our hands and feet, then run back in the truck for five to warm up, then back out for two, back in for six, back out for 3 and so on. If you were there and someone told you it was Antarctica, you might believe them.

Down near the sea wall in Stratford, that resturant that used to be right on the water next to Marnicks, it got torn down. I don't remember why. Maybe fire. Maybe it was just old. I don't know. There's a few other pictures of the rubble of it in the album. It was pretty cool lookin in during the snow.

So right now there is a rejected piece of NASA space craft on my couch.

Yeah.

My mom's friend in Cali (my step dad's brother) knew a guy who used to work for NASA like over 20 years ago who got to keep rejected pieces and they've been sitting there for like 20 years. So, my mom's friend thought they would make nice flower pots. It's huge. So he got her one too and mailed it to her.

Am I the only one who thinks this is absolutely insane? NASA space craft, on my couch. It could have ...you know, been in FUCKING SPACE. if it wasn't rejected.

And really, I don't think it's insane in a bad way cause well, I kinda want one now too. Ok, not kinda. I do. In fact I'd love to have.

<b>ADDED, bitches:</b>
So as you will believe me in ludicrous claims...I have added a photo. A bad one via my cellular telephone, but...well, eat me.

To better illustrate the sheer size of this piece of space craft, I photographed it next to a familiar, exoteric item so people can get a better feel of it's exact dimentions. This item is my fish tank, which yes, is a blender, with my pet fish Davis in it. Davis is the spot in the upper-right of the tank. If you have access to a zoom tool on your computer you can see Davis's left fin flipping me off with haste. This is a common reaction when you pick up a fish's tank and place him on the floor next to a piece of rejected NASA space craft."

If you think there's a lot in that album, I actually took a bunch out. Especially of The Gates. It can seem redundant. Orange. Orange. Orange. I know.
Ehh, whatever. I thought it was great. If I can remember that far back. Hmmm....yeah, I think I do. It was great. I think Cristina had her fix on orange though. At first I thought she was going to shoot me for making her go, but she started to dig. It's true, there may have been other more productive things to do with over a million dollors on brightly color fabric, but that's the world we live. I enjoyed it.

So I gotta scoot. My bedtime started without me. But yesterday was a BBQ at Rob's and I watched Wayne spit fire. Barcadi 151. 
Mmmmhmmm.

Night kids!"

"event","So remember that thing I did that time out of a plane like 2 weeks ago?
Well, I did it again this weekend.

So what I didn't mention last time about when there was 8 of us jumping for Tanya's birthday was that Rob didn't get to jump. There was a problem with his harness and they had to bring him back down with the plane and that plane was the last one before sunset that day so he didn't get a chance to go back up. He got a rain check from them and was going back up. I was just going to go and ya know, support my buddy, but then I thought about it. ""I am going to be driving all the way up there again. And they do cut off like almost 40 bucks if you jump again within 30 days. I'm gonna be there anyways.""
So with no real convincing I had to do on myself, I decided I was jumping again.
It was Rob, me, Robbie Black and his buddy Brandon. We all jumped.
No pictures this time. Plus it was just the 4 of us and we were all going to be jumping together out of the same plane so there would have been no one on the ground to take pictures anyways.

So let me tell you, this time was much different and WAY cooler.
For starters, the weather was 10 times better and clearer.
This time we totally did jump from 14,000 feet (and by the way, last time after I read my certificate, we didn't jump from only 12,000ft, it said we jumped from 13,500...anyways). So this time from where we were in the sky, not only did I get a much better view of Springfield, MA...when my instructor pointed it out last time I just looked at the area, this time I actually saw the little city. This tiny spec, you could see this small group of tall buildings and that was actually downtown Springfield. Then this time, I could actually see Long Island, NY. I could see the entire shoreline of New London, CT and beyond after that, there's water, then there's more land on the other side and that was Long Island!!!!!
And even better, I forgot exactly where it was in New Hampshire, but I could see the mountains of NH!!!!  Like literally, I could see OVER Massachusetts. My instrctor pointed it out to me ""There's Massachusetts and on the other side, those mountains, that's New Hampshire."" I'm sorry, but that was incredible.
Bonus: Remember how I said on the way down near the airport there was a bunch of cows I could see? Well, this time I found out, that's no ordinary farm. It's a veal farm. Ha. oh god.

Now the better part. This time my instructor whom I'm attached too was this cool ass woman named Janel. Ok, back track a bit. So while we're all sitting around all day I'm looking at all the instructors and wondering which one I'm going to get this time. There's this one guy, I swear, spitting image of Micheal Chiklis. The guy from The Shield, but more importantly...The Commish. Then I'm talking to one of the guys there and find out his name is Haas (pronounced like ""Haws"") which I thought was so fitting for some reason. So Haas was originally supposed to be my instructor and Janel was supposed to be Rob's and I'm like ""Holy shit man. I'm going to jump out of a plane with The Commish!"" Haha. But after calculating our weights, Rob was too heavy for Janel so we switched. Rob got to jump out of a plane with The Commish!!! Hahaha. 
So Janel was bad ass. Since she knew that I had already jumped 2 weeks ago before, she asked me if I wanted more responsibility and wanted to do cooler things. I said HELL YES I DO! When you first jump, what you have to do is very minimal. Basically you jump and with your instructor behind you with their legs open in a V, you're legs are to remain together with your arms out in the ""Touch Down"" position and you have to arch your whole body, stretching your legs between theirs as if you're trying to kick them in the ass. Then, some instructors let you hold on to the chute while they steer. Not really anything else you need to concentrate on doing.
This time, she went over this whole routine with me and was leaving it all up to me to lead. Obviously, if I fucked it up or anything, she would take over. She strapped an Altimeter on my hand and everything. First, we did front flips out of the plane. Then when we come out of the flips I had to check my Altimeter and feel and make sure I knew where the chute cord was. Then spun around to the right and came back. Then we spun around to the left and came back. Then I had to check the Altimeter to see how much longer we had. Then next we did this thing called ""tracking"". It's just basically where we take ourselves out of the arch position, put our arms at our sides and point our legs straight like Superman, and we just fuckin BOOK IT across the sky like a bullet. GAHHWHWHWWWW!!!!! Then after we came outta that I had to watch the Altimeter and make sure I pull the cord at 5,500 feet. Which I did and then we floated around. She let me steer the chute a little too and we did some hard turns. SISISISIIICCKKKKK.
This time my landing wasnt so bad, but wasn't so gentle like last time either. At about 300 feet she says ""We out of wind so we're going to approach pretty fast."" When we pulled the chute to lift us before we hit the ground we pulled real hard and still bumped a bit. My ass hurt when we hit, so after I just stood up and shook it, cause when anything hurts, I find if you shake it, it'll feel better. A sore ass for only about 2 hours isn't anything to sulk about though.
And as before, I did eat some clouds. I also can't get over how I've actually had clouds in my lungs. However hippie that sounds, I had clouds running through my blood and I think thats beyond great.
This only thing that was kinda difficult was last time, all I had to do was arch and fall so I had plenty of time to just try and concentrate on breathing cause the air is so thin and hitting you at 120mph, but this time I had all this stuff to do so I had to do it and concentrate on breathing at the same time, but hey, human's aren't supposed to fly anyways, so a little extra concentration on breathing is a very small price to pay.

So yeah. Rob loved it too. Seriously, I'd do this often if money wasn't a question. My wallet may be sore for some time now, but this was a great opportunity to go sky diving again. How could I have not?
I was under the impression that it was only seasonal. Cause up in the sky that high it's much colder so when it's cold at ground level, it's gotta be too much up there. Well, this may be so, but one of the guys there that we started paling around with told us that they jump all year round. He said it gets really ass cold and because of that they only jump from about 10,000ft, but ya just gotta dress a little warmer and you're good to go.
So Rob was suggesting we go again sometime in January between both our birthdays. If I go in January we both agreed we want to go while there's snow on the ground. Oh man, how amazing would that look?!
Well, thats some time away. We'll see.

Alright. That's that. Tomorrow I have work. Yeah, I had today off cause of the holiday, but I could have used the money. So with my time off, I went and picked Raspberries.
Cause I can. And I did. And they're delicious."

So Boston's come back in the last inning for the summer. Redemption. 1 point.

So this weekend I helped move Thompson back into Boston, well, Weston for now, bout 15 mins out, but...
I didn't think anyone actually moved back to Boston. It just seems like one of those places where you go there, do what you gotta do then get the hell out and move on.
Guess fuckin not.
If you didn't know already, he got a job being the Resident Director (an RD if you're college dorm hip) for our old school. Basically he's responsible for all the dorm students. It's a hooked up job too. So, his housing is free. All of it. They built an apartment in the basement of the dorms. He lives in it. No special rules, lives in it like it's his own place, cause it is. They pay rent and all utilities including a cell phone. Plus, he gets a decent salary on top of that. Also, after 6 months he can start taking classes....for free. 
Bonus. His girlfriend also gets to live with him, for free. It's part of the job that they need him on campus as much as possible, so even if he had an entire family, they would live there for free.
I know.
So I can't even be mad about him leaving cause it's a great opportunity for him.
Friday we had a going away for him at Helwigs (which is apparently where EVERYONE has their going away bash) got his ass so drunk. My god. I was driving him. Plus, I knew I was going to be leaving the next morning to Boston with him, leaving as soon as his hangover subsided. So part of my logic was ""the drunker we get him, the worse his hangover would be, the later we get to leave"" so I def bought him a few drinks and a couple shots. 
Next day we packed his car and mine and Rob came with me and drove him on up. Unpacked his stuff (which no kidding is clothes, CD's and comic books...not really much else other than his best DVD's) then went into the city for food. Got some Spike's hot dogs. Walked around. Went to Target....oh god.
So that fucker has NOTHING in his apartment and we were going to later go back to it and drink and play cards cause that's all we had. Cool. Well I suggested he get a cheap clock radio, ya know, just to have some toons. Something like 5 bucks. He agreed. We get to Target, the cheapest one they have is $7.99. Apparently they actually did have one for $4.99, but they were out of them. Since Chris was under the impression that a clock radio would be only 5 bucks and there were only one's for 7.99 left...that he didn't want one then. There would be no 7.99 clock radio for Chris Thompson. Nope. Nothing. Nein.
Not that this was all a big deal, it's just something quirky about Thompson that I love to pick on. So even though he doesn't want it, I'm going to buy him that 7.99 clock radio from Target for his birthday in September. Then I'm going to buy him another for Christmas. And I'm really considering Valentines day as well, that one I'll mail to him. And of course I'm serious.
So anyways, Target, we bought beers (cause I do miss being able to buy booze till 11pm) and went back and drank and played cards and some drunken guitar singing....and a fuck load of talking, especially about STD's and bad jokes. Then they both told me that my slight allergy to beer was in my head. Then they told me that I wasn't really a lesbian either. That was just in my head as well. I agreed. ""It's true, I'm not really a lesbian. I just do it for the chicks.""
They next day we went out for breakfast/lunch and parted ways with Thompson cause he had work training to do. Rob and I spent half the day in Forrest Hill Cemetery cause it's sick. Not like the regular cemetary. HUGE. Lots of fancy stuff and art. Then we walked around. Went to Harvard Square. There's this like food import store called Cardullo's that I heart in Harvard Square. They've got chocolate for most countries around the world. Plus they got all those awsome Cadbury candy bars that only regularly circulate in Canada and the UK. So I'm paying for my candy and I double take what I see. That's right. Larva meal worms and crickets. Mmmhmm. Before I even said anything the cashier tells me ""Oh yeah. They're real."" SICK. I was in awe....so of course, I had to buy some. I asked for suggestions and I ended up with one box of BBQ Larva and one box of Salt n' Vinegar Crickets. They're very small boxes. Don't plan on putting em in a bowl as a party snack. The whole idea I think is bonkers and creepy as hell, but I know they won't kill me so I figured since the opportunity to try BBQ Larva and Salt n' Vinegar Crickets doesn't come often if at all so I might as well jump on it. I wanted a companion in my ventures and when I first asked Rob his said no way. Then out of nowhere he hands me his pinky and says he'll eat them with me. We haven't done it yet. We need to do it in front of at least one other person, ya know, like a notary of proof that we ate larva and crickets.
Anyways, bullshit, bullshit. Walked around, ate at Sunset Grill. Had a beer, drove home. AKA, I drove, Rob slept the whole ride. Then we stopped and met up with people at the end of the Ridicu-lympics. I heard there was a lot of mud and pasta bathing and cake fighting. Guess we'll have to catch it next year.
ANYWAYS...
a point of all this I wanted to make was...
Where the fuck is everyone going?!?!
Seriously, this has been the summer of dissipation.
Yes, McCarthy left to become a trucker earlier last year. Eric had left for LA over a year ago.

Just beginning with April 15th: (in almost perfect order)
Tara leaves for LA and joins other Milford, CT residents.
Spen leaves for Austin, TX (currently back in MA working at his dad's, but come Nov. back to Austin for good.)
Melanson leaves for Austin, TX then moved somewhere outside it.
Novack leaves for  New Braunfels, TX.
Megan leaves for Ohio for trucker school.

That was all in the span of under 2 months. Disgusting.

Also,
Jazz and Brenna left for Nashville, TN
Jonas (whom I never got to see before he left) left for NH.
Jimmy (Rob's brother) left for N. Carolina (though he actually should be moving back in 3 weeks.)
Laine was supposed to move to San Fran, CA but is delaying it till Jan. because of a new lovely girlfriend.
Elena and Laura actually left today for Italy. Say they'll be back in 6 months, but I doubt it.
And then a hit to the head, Thompson to Boston, MA taking She' with him.

I really feel like I'm forgeting someone too. Mmmmmm. Damn it.

Listen, I know people gotta move eventually, but come on folks. Spread yourselves out. Holy shit.
All just this summer.

And I know, there's nothing that can replace the friends I really care about, but I also know that with the way life flows, for the old friends I lose, new ones are supposed to come in. Not to ever replace, but just continue a cycle. But I'm tellin ya, I really feel like everybody's been leaving, but no one new is really coming in yet. I hate it. It's like, after I moved to Boston, after a year and a half I finally had a friend base of people that I really liked. They were great kids. I had known them for some time now. I loved them. Then all of a sudden after graduation, no lie, 90% of all the friends I made split town within a month and a half. Either moved far away in MA, but mostly moved out of the state. It was uncanny. Even Thompson moved home after graduation while I stayed in Boston for another year and a half. I hated it then too. It was forcing me close to miserable. Since school was done, I wasn't around as many cool kids anymore. I mainly only hung out with the few friends I had that hadn't left. It wasn't till bout 6 months later when I got my job at JP Licks that I met some good kids. And it wasn't till about 3 months before I left that we had all gotten close enough to the point where I was sufficiently happy with my new friend base again. Then I left for CT.
Being back home with good ol' CT kids was nice again. The best part was being back with my friends that had known me for years on years and the best friends I had left and was able to come back to as if I never had. I can't deny that during a good chunck of living in Boston I became a much more bitter and miserable person that I had ever personally been in my life so far, so in ways I don't know how psyched I would have been to be my friend either. Though really, I was always the same person, I'm just not ashamed to say I wasn't at my best at that time. 
I reconnected. I got better acquainted with people I had only fairly known before I left and met new friends of friends that I had never met before. I was back to the better part of how I used to be. 

I don't know. I think where this is coming from is I'm afraid of what happened after I graduated in Boston happeneing again, but when it happened before, I knew I still had all my awsome friends back in CT. But this time, it would be those friends. It'd be a blow to the mother board. And part of me feels like it's already begun to happen. When everyone left this summer, it was just really disappointing. Because I knew that the people I cared to mention were good people regardless of how much I actually saw which ones. After meeting the train wrecks of people I met through out my stay in Boston (whom, like myself, could have just been a result of the bitterness and misery that can occur by living in such conidtions. I do to a point believe in a city turning a ""good girl bad"") after having met who I did, I appreciated good people even more and valued the opportunity to be around when they'd come by. 
And now with Thompson leaving, that's someone I spend a good amount of my time with. Good people are good people, but I know not everybody can handle seeing me on a daily basis. Everybody is their own acquired taste. 

Ok, listen. I know I really shouldn't be complaining here. And I'm really not. I think I just needed to get that out of my system.
For the record. Not everyone I met in Boston was bad. I did and still do know great kids up there that I still talk to today. I don't even regret dealing with the horrible ones I met. I'm actually glad I met them. And I'm not even really mad about any of it anymore. And I should be lucky that not only did I get to move up there with AND attend the same school as one of my best friends from home, but I even got to live with another one for the whole 3 years. Even if she did threaten to push me off the edge of sanity, at least it was someone I cared about doing it.
And yeah, a lot of people have left, but not everyone. Even though they left, they're not dead. Just not close. And I know I'm still gonna see Thompson. I regularly visit Boston anyways, this just gives me a better reason and now I know I always have a comfortable place to stay.
Plus, I still have the sanity pusher, Rob, Brian and a bunch of other good kids still around. And I'm sure it's just a matter of time before new one's come a knockin.

Oh man, did you read all that?
I completely just talked myself into a problem then talked myself right out of it. Hahaha.
Ya know, I don't even care if no one reads this. I feel a bit better now.

See, these journals are good for somethin. I think I just really did need to get all that out. It had been bothering me all summer.
God, I'm such a worry freak.

Hmmm...what else do I need to get out of my system?

Hahah. Nothing I care to share on the internet I'm sure.

Ok, this session is done.

...and to all a good night."

"event","So I feel like I can't post about anything else until I post about sky diving.
So I went and got my pictures off the camera cause I think it's just one of those things where pictures later just won't be as interesting.

Sky diving.
Intense.

So it took place behind this small airport in Ellington, CT. I never even heard of before this. It's pretty far from these parts. Bout an hour and a half I'd say. North of Hartford, north of Manchester. You know, the pointless part of CT.
When we got there it was cloudy and everyone had to wait around for the weather. It got good eventually, then we got a crazy thunder storm for 15 minutes. Nearly took a tent clean down. Cleared up. Weather better than ever. So we were basically there all day.
I don't even know where to start.
So obviously, I went tandem. Means I've got somebody strapped to my back. You have to. They won't let you jump by yourself. You gotta do it a bunch of times, get certified. Something of the likes. 
Now was I scared? This surprised me. No.
I knew I was going to be doing it for about a month and whenever I thought about it I would just kind of brush it off like ""Pfffft. Jumping out of a plane. That's nuts. Can't believe I'm gonna do that."" I would get mildly freaked when I'd think about it but for no more than .043 of a second. I mean, how can you really take seriously that you're going to be jumping out of a moving plane at over 12,000 feet? That's just something humans aren't supposed to do. How do you really rationalize that in your brain?! You can't.
I just figured it would catch up with me at some point and I'd actually feel fear.
On the car up right before we're there, Rob asks me if I'm nervous. I looked at him and said ""No. and THAT scares me."" I was still not nervous about it, but this made me believe that I wouldn't be until the very last moment. I'd be on that plane, look down, and not that I'd do anything rash, but at that second, internally, I'd be freaking out.
When the time came, I had been anticipating it all day. I had already watched other people do it. When I stepped onto that plane I was so busy chatting with my instructor that I didn't even notice the plane had left the ground. Crazy.
I ended up being the first off the plane (aside from the ""professionals"".) Every plane theres about 5 people that get on last. They're just people who do this ""professionally"" for lack of a better word. They're just catching a ride up with us. Jump out way before us so they hit the ground and get out of the way before us. They do all that cool shit in the air you see on TV. They join hands. Make diamonds. All that jazz.
Anyways, I'm goin first on that plane. So me and my attatched instructor approach the open side door. This was actually the worst part of all of it, but still wasn't so bad. So to position ourselves to jump out sideway, we both have to be bent at the knees in almost the catcher's position. Now between having a large guy glued to my back, the flight suit on over all my clothes and that cumbersome harness, flexibility isn't the easiest thing to come by in the least. For some reason, it felt like an eternity, but maybe like 35 seconds or so, we remained in that position. I'm just crouched over staring out the plane onto the ground. Like my feet were 2 inches from the air, if that plane shifted we'd just fall right out. I guess they were waiting for like a better hole in the clouds or something.
The reason this was the worst part was not cause I was on the edge looking down for so long, it was the position I was in. It was so difficult for me to hold that stance for that long given my said flexibility issues. I don't know what muscle I was using, but it was hurtin....but...soon enough I was airborne.
Oh, and remember how I said I'd be jumping out of a plane at 14,000 feet? Well, I lied. We were supposed to though. In fact, the plane before us even went to 15,000 feet. Seeing the weather caused a bunch of delays that day, they were trying to save some time to try and get the last plane load of people out before sunset. So that only dropped us at 12,000 feet. Like you can really tell the difference at that point anyways. Seriously, after you get to a certain height you can't see movement in the ground anymore. It just feels like you're hovering in one spot and not moving at all. Actually ended up being to late and we were the last plane before sunset.
When I first jumped out of the plane, you don't have time to really worry about anything else but breathing. Not only are you dropping at 120mph and have winds hitting your face at that speed, but the air that high is so incredibly thin. Because of this, it actually feels incredibly thick and difficult to take in. I think part of that maybe is that you're at the edge of the mildly foggy cloud line and I was actually breathing in clouds.
How fucking amazing is that!
I was breathing in clouds!!!
Another thing during the free fall is the sound. It's the sound of thin air flying past you at 120mph. From what I can remember, it just kind of sounded like a loud helicopter. Seeing this, you can't really communicate with each other during free fall. You just have to make gestures. My instructor tapped me on the shoulders and pointed for me to check out the horizon as my attention was towards the ground. It was obviously like nothing I had ever seen before. We were still in the cloud line and it was nearing sunset so the sun was low. Now when I say horizon, up the it consists of darker blue, white for the clouds and lighter blue below the clouds with the sun somewhere in the middle. 
It was like nothing else.
Now just so ya know, during the jump it's about 60 seconds of free falling and about 4-5 minutes after the chute deploys. It deploys at about 5,000-6,000 feet. So do that math. Ok, I will. About 7,000 feet a minute. 3,500 feet in 30 seconds. 1,750 feet in 15 seconds. 875 feet in 7 seconds. 437 feet in 3.5 seconds. So about 200 feet per second. Somewhere around there. Holy crap. Ha.
After it opened we were able to talk to each other. The first thing I said was ""So, now we know who has a pool.""
They were the first thing I noticed. Pool liners are such a bright blue that when you look down you see tons of all these little bright blue circles and rectangles. It's crazy.
Before we had jumped, my instructor asked me what town I lived in so he could show it to me. For some reason, I believe because of the haze from where we would be, you couldn't see Stratford. He asked me if I had lived anywhere else so I told him Boston, just kind of kidding cause I knew we wouldn't be able to see it. Well, at the moment we couldn't, but he told me in October I could. No way! Because of the heat, humidity, during the summer it creates some haze after so many miles. In October it's cooler so there isn't. He told me that in October not only would I be able to see Boston, but the mountains of Vermont all the way to Long Island. ?!?!?! Bananas! B-A-N-A-N-A-S.
So while we're out in the chute he starts pointing things out to me. The UCONN stadium. Somers prison. Even at that height and haze, he pointed out Springfield, MA to me. Shit man.
So basically, at that moment, anyone who was in the tri-state area and some beyond, I was above you. 
There was actually some farm with a huge cow pen too. As we got closer for some reason I thought it humourous to look down at about 100 cows and they look all tiny chewing their grass and being cows. Ha.

I don't know, still, it was all really surreal. And it was definitely all just way too much for anyone to take in in under 5 minutes really. 
Pretty breath taking, literally.
Being that high above, it's strangely stunning. You feel so small, but so large both at the same time.
I've never known anything like it and I don't think I ever will.

On the drive home, after the feeling of falling at 120mph, driving at 70 felt like nothing at all. I could easily see how life can seem so slow to someone who sky dives regularly. Which I don't think would be a bad thing if you took it the right way.

So here are some pictures. It's just basically the before and after. I wish I had some from the sky.

This was our landing field. Not as big as I expected.

This was the plane we jumped out of. If you think that's small, on the weekdays when they're less busy, they have people jump out of Cessnas. Mmmhmm.

This one has a better view of my get-up. I'm thinking of buying one to regularly throw over my clothes to wear out to the club. Hot. Hmm. Right. When I put it on I couldn't decide if I looked like I was about to jump out of a plane, take a seat in the Daytona 500 or be an extra in the video for ""Uptown Girl"" by Billy Joel.

And this was taken in shock that I wasn't wearing my stupid hat. I figured I'd share because apparently the only time this is visible is when I'm jumping out of a plane or you're having sex with me and most who know me know there's a better chance at catching me jump out of a plane. Sadly.

And my landing. Landing actually isn't nearly as bad as you'd think it would be. Typically very gentle. We happened to be facing down wind so I bumped a bit and ate some dirt, but it wasn't bad at all.

In less than 12 hours I will be sky diving and I still can not register that I am doing it.
I don't think it will until I am in that plane 14,000 above.

I'm so excited and terrified at the same time. That is why I want to do it. 

So Rob and I decided that since we would be attempting such feats the next day, that maybe we should stop in a  church somewhere and just clear things up with the big guy for a minute, you know, check it. Well...we went to 4 or 5 different churches from here to West Haven and none of them were open. God had locked us out. Funny, isn't it? I'm not taking it personally though.
In addition to that, I actually wrote a will. I don't think I'm die. In fact, I know I'm not going to die.  Fact. I would know it if I were going to die.
It was just kind of a good excuse to write a will. More for me than anything. I was interested in seeing what I thought my life looked like on about 8 pages. Honestly, I learned a thing or two about me so far that I never had to think about before, cause well, I never had to write a will. I'm actually not even done with it, I'm gonna go finish it before I go to sleep.
Then I'm going to put it in my room somewhere and then when I get back from sky diving I'm going to take it and destroy it. Therapeutic.
And it's funny too, in some parts I thought I'd have more to say. And how ""cliche"" I guess a will can look. But every cliche, well, you really mean them. When you think about it, ""love"" is the most common victim of a cliche than anything else. But it's the bottom line to everything in existence. So it really makes me think that a ""cliche"" can only really be a ""cliche"" when you say them without any emotion what so ever. It's like criticizing someone who falls in love because it's been done before. That's crazy talk.

Anyways, off I go. I'm sure I'll end up writing about how sick it all was.
I'll catch you all on the ground later.
And at this point I would throw in a ""I love you all. Every single person I've ever met. Even the ones who did me wrong along the way. I still love my enemies. I consider myself very lucky."" yadda yadda yadaa
But the fact that I have to be in a position where I could die that makes me want to say that is really just a shame and I feel bad about that sometimes.
So, I won't REALLY say it, cause I mean it everyday and this day should be no different from the rest.
So, I'm not saying it.

By the time anyone reads this I will most likely be in the air or already have done it by the time you get to this from you office computer Monday morning.

"event","So this dream.

Last night, or more rather, this morning, I had this really strange dream.

It was very quick. 

From what I can remember of it, it consisted of a woman lying on a wooden floor in what I think was an art studio space and she looks at me and says: 
""You have to live in a room where a cello is dreaming that a cello is not.""

Now, the art space she was in was I think suppose to resemble ""The Nest"" which is an dirty old factory building in Bridgeport near the rock quarries off I95 that they are turning into galleries and art studios for rent that I actually went to visit a couple weeks ago. I saw an ad about some photo exhibit called ""Live Bait"" and wanted to check it out for the hell of it. I brought Rob with me. We got there and the doors we found were locked so we entered through the third floor fire escape. Then we found a guy inside who took us for a tour of the entire building and unlocked the room where the exhibit was so we could see it. All in all, it was pretty strange, but cool.
Now, why was the woman in my dream in that art studio? It actually seemed like she was lying on the main gallery floor. Anyways. Well, maybe thats because that art studio is the only one I've ever really seen. So maybe it's because it's the only one I know. But why an art studio? I have no idea.
Who was the woman? I also have no idea. While I was at ""The Nest"" I actually didn't even meet any woman at all. I met two guys and saw a couple others.
Also, the woman was older. And when I say older I mean about 50ish. I also remember she had semi-long hair to her shoulders that was dark, but only in streaks as she was going gray.
And when I say ""lying"", not like face down like she had fallen, but on her back, like just hanging out with her hands behind her head.  

In my dream, when she said what she said, it made complete sense to me and I thought it was beautiful. In my dream I kept repeating it to myself over and over cause in my dream I knew that after I woke up I would forget it. So I only vaguely remember, in my sleep I actually got up and leaned over to my end table and got the nearest pen and paper and wrote it down. Basically in my sleep with my eyes closed.

I later woke up and soon after remembered that I did have some kind of weird dream that involved a cello somehow  and I wrote something down somewhere. Before I got up to look at the paper I tried to remember what the hell it was that I wrote down, but I couldn't.
So I grabbed the pad and read it. I almost laughed. ""Where the hell do I get this stuff?!?"" 
Not only did I write it down, but not to my recollection at all, I wrote it twice for some reason. 
This is what my camera phone says it looks like:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v59/vsvictrolavs/cellodreaming.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

I can't recall ever really having dreams that so bluntly tried to give me any kind of a message what-so-ever. Usually, it's just me doing things or at certain places and if there was ever supposed to be a message, well, I guess I'm just supposed to try and figure that out myself. Like, no one in any of my dreams that I can recall even talked to me in the manner of that they were telling me something of any kind of substance like that. As oppose to someone in a dream of mine telling me ""Hey, let's have sex."" or ""Where the fuck is your car?"" or ""How come you get the biggest laser gun?"".

I don't know. I also kind of just wanted to write this all down so I wouldn't forget it.
And man, even though I know I'm weird and I have weird dreams all the time and I always think that everything means something...honestly, this one is kinda blowing my fucking mind. 

""You have to live in a room where a cello is dreaming that a cello is not.""

I try to read into that and I just think it can mean so many things, and they're all pretty heavy and it blows my fucking mind!!! Not to mention that I think, and I feel most can not disagree, cellos are absolutely beautiful, so if there was any way to send myself a message using something to objectify beauty, a cello would be a way. Especially with the way it's worded, bringing personification to a cello suggesting that it's not inanimate, that just kind of makes it bigger like ""living beauty"" or something. 
So what I mentioned before, that was the whole dream. Just that. But for some reason I fell like maybe when she said what she said that she was saying it like she lived in that art studio, which other artists and musicians all lived in close proximity. And part of living there was you had to tolerate your surroundings. You had to deal with the constant music and disruptions. Like someone had complained about all the noise and she was stating like ""You have to accept it because it's beautiful. This is all life trying to become itself. And that's beauty. To be able to live here, you have to understand that."" And in ""here"" I think more maybe not that art studio, but the world in general. Like ""the noise"" was representing what people do in the process of doing something great in their life. And so on and so on in that manner.
Another way I look at it is, more towards me personally. Like ""I have to live in a room (my life) where I look at the things I want to do and stop looking at them and know that they can be done."" Which is something I didn't think I needed a kick in the ass about. I'm pretty stubborn, if I want to do something I do it. I'm also pretty positive about my future too. I'm fairly confident that I'll do great things with my life and have great things happen to me. And when I say ""great"" I mean it on my definitions of ""great"", I'm not saying I'm going to change the world or cure cancer or anything on that scale. ""Great"" like I'll be happy with what I've done and where I am.
So I look at it not so much as to get off my ass and do what I want to do, but more focusing on denying my insecurities I always have in the process that cause me to hesitate. Maybe a kick in the ass to not be so unduly cautious. (Which is something I know I'll do anyways which cycles back to how stubborn I am.)

I don't know. This could all mean numerous and many different things. I'm just thinking out loud here.

Well, I think I'll commit to a first step in this supposed life changing message and get my ass in the shower. I'll approach my first battle for the cause of cleanliness as I find myself in a fierce state of dirt.

Like woah."

So I just got the pictures off my laptop from the night Thompson and I got in our drunken fist fight and I sanitized his car with napkins.

Even though most have heard this story before, I figured I'd tell it one more time for the internet and those who hadn't heard it. 

So one cold winter night in Feb, Thompson and I were just running around his house all evening getting drunk and Rob was going to drive me home later that night.
So we're all hanging out and I guess it started with one of those drunken pushes of the shoulder like ""no, you shut up."" to which I cast upon Thompson. In retort, he hits me back harder. So I reciprocate. And so on. Till we're standing in position to begin this drunken fist fight that we just decided we were having. All in good fun. Now, anyone else who's gotten into a ""fist fight"" with a friend, it's kinda of a known rule that you basically just take punches at each other back and forth and your aim is for the shoulders and upper arms. Like Charlie Horses. Which is how we started. Then Thompson, that little shit, trys to kick out my left leg and gets me in the bad knee. He didn't mean to get my bad knee, but it was still a bitch move. At this point, I'm so drunk, I'm laughing the entire time. I think it's hilarious. So I start goin to town on him, continuing in the Charlie Horse punching style. 
Rob picks up the phone and starts calling people:
""Oh my god, I wish you were here right now. Chris and Carla are fighting like there's a cash prize.""
So this all continues. Then I notice Chris taking swings at my ladies. So I ask him ""Why do you keeping punching for my tits?"" and he replies ""Cause I know it hurts.""
OhhhhhSNAP!
Now, most ask me after I say that why I didn't just kick him in the balls. Honestly, I was just too drunk and didn't think about it. I was just so drunk and happy and thought everything was hilarious. I just started swinging harder. Soon after...so we're fighting on hard wood floors. Chris is wearing socks. I crank up for a whopping punch, then picture in slow motion, mid swing Thompson takes a slip on the floor and starts to fall. BAM. I nailed him directly in the side of the head and knocked his glasses clear across the room. ""Holy shit man, I'm sorry, you're head fell in the strike zone!""
We decide thats the end of it. He walks over to get his glasses and we hug in a ""Good game. Nice hustle."" fashion. Then he says ""Ok, I'm going in my room to have sex now."" and makes a drunken stumble towards the bedroom.
So I remain in Rob's room sittin drunk faced, hanging out and reflecting for about 10 mins, about to leave soon and I remembered I left my jacket on their bed and there was a possibility they could be having sex on it at this very moment. So I jump up and start yelling and run over to their room. ""Please, please stop having sex!!!"" I barely knock on the door before pushing it open and tell them to remain under the covers, I run in. Grab my jacket off the floor, then I look over at stunned Thompson naked with a blanket wrapped around his waist. And just like that ""I wanna punch you while you have a hard on!"" I leaned over and WHAM a clean shot. There was nothing he could do. Hahahaha. I mean, if I was in the middle of having sex with my girlfriend and in a matter of 5 seconds someone busted in the room basically unannounced, ran grabbed a jacket, turned and whaled me in the arm then ran out just as quick as they came in....hahahHAHaha. I don't know man.
So we get in Rob's truck and maybe I start to sober up, but I start to realize just how much of a bitch Thompson was fighting like. And I start to actaully think I should have done more. That hitting him with a hard on wasn't enough. Rob and I go to Walgreens cause that's the only think open at like 2am. I end up purchasing two 50 count bags of economy Maxi pads, a bar of soap, a pink bow and a pair of womens leggings.
Drive back to the house. I cover the car in every maxi pad, throw the leggings on the side mirrors, put the pink bow on the roof and write ""Congrats on becoming a woman!"" on his windshield in soap. I figure if he's gonna fight like a bitch he might as well be one.
These are the drunken celebratory shots:

</lj-cut>
So the next morning after Chris finishes cleaning up the mess, because half the pads blew off his car and were spread up and down his street (!!)...he later that day hands them back to me in bags. I just looked at him ""Why would you give these back to me? They're just gonna come back at you one day?""
So five months later.
Long story short (if I even know how to do that anymore)...
On Sundays, it's Entourage night. Me, Thompson and Rob watch Entourage at 10pm cause they have HBO and we're all addicted. Then, Thompson and I both have work early the next day so we crash right after it's done. The end. 
Anyways, we were hit with a surprise board game that no one told us about. I didn't want to play, Thompson didn't want to play, but we were being begged. After all the begging I was still stickin with I was going home and sleeping. Then Thompson, I don't know why, prob just to piss me off says ""If Carla stays and plays, I'll play."" Fucker. So now I'm suckered in. Mad. Ready to get it over with. There's now 5 of us. Then it's brought up that you only need 4 people to play. Before those words are even finished being said, Thompson is up already at the door...""Ok cool, I'll go to bed then. Night!"" and literally books it to his room.
I was steamin. What a bitch.
So I figured since Chris didn't get a chance to play a puzzle game with us that evening, it was unfair to him. So I sent him one in the mail that week:

A little mix-a-roo.

Into the box we go.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v59/vsvictrolavs/box.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
And to the post office.
I covered his address to protect the innocent, but if you really wanted it...I'd give it to ya if you asked. If you look carefully, the return address is obviously not mine. If you know of any of Chris's prior problems, you might find it hilarious that I made the return address Sallie Mae's PO Box. 
Just thinking about the slight possibility that if for some reason it didn't get to him it would be mailed directly to Sallie Mae. With his address. And a box of Maxi pads hinting that he actually wore one for 2 hours.....oh god. I could just cry tears of pure, unadulterated joy right now.
</lj-cut>
And in case you were wondering, it worked very well. He opened up the box and pieced it all together right there on the kitchen floor. Hahahaa.

Well, thats that for now.
Life is fun."

I just have to say something.
I am going sky diving on the 21st of August.

The idea got put in my head at the end of last summer when I heard about ""Captain No Beard"" and Wayne doing it. The option that I even could, I never thought of. In CT even. Not far. So I said last summer that when it got warm again that I would do it.
Now, Tanya's birthday is coming and she wanted to do something ""nuts"" for her birthday. So she thought skydiving. What a convenience and perfect reason to do it. And really, what could be better than doing it with a group of friends.
As far as I know, it's definites on Me, Tanya, Rob, Jimmy and Tanya's sister. We're pretty confident in a couple other people too. But theres still plenty of time to get even more. (B, you should be so down on this.)
I can't believe it.
It really seems surreal.

I'm going to be jumping out of a plane at 14,000 feet.

I'm going to be jumping out of a plane at 14,000 feet.
I'm going to be jumping out of a plane at 14,000 feet.

I'm going to be jumping out of a plane at 14,000 feet.

I can't get over that.
When I think about it hard I get a smirk on my face and I stop breathing.

I already signed my name to Tanya's make shift permission slips on agreeing to do it. I said I wouldn't sign it cause I wasn't sure if I could come up with the money ($200) so I didn't wanna promise I'd do it if I couldn't afford it, but they all said that as long as I was willing to and for some reason didn't have the money we'd find a way.

On another note, I got stung by a bee in the ass two days ago.
I was weed whacking and when I went to move rocks I guess I threw one on a big ground hive and angered them. I fuckin ran my dirty ass away from that swarm at gold metal speed.
When I went back to see what the weed whacker was doing cause I had just dropped it and ran, seemed pretty clear. I still wasn't approaching it. Pretty far. Then this one little fucker, he was holding a major grudge. Stung my ass, literally, through my t-shirt and skivvies. I screamed and ran again. 
Let me tell you, I have not been stung  by a bee since I was maybe about 9 years old. Never in my entire memory did I ever remember a bee sting hurting like this. It hurt 10 times more that I could have ever imagined. I'm running around the house yelling ""fuckfuckfuckfuck"" with half my ass hanging out of my rolled down boxer briefs in a fashion of those old cartoons where the character gets his ass set on fire and starts freaking out looking for that bucket of water or a puddle to extinguish his blazing derriere. Panicking and running in circles I make it inside and the first thing I think of is alcohol, but I don't see any so I grab a bottle of vodka from the freezer and throw that on a rag to sooth my pain. Didn't work wonders. I later used baking powder.
Seriously, I can't get over how much that hurt. I was so surprised. Seriously the mos painful thing I've felt in a good while. It hurt for the whole rest of the day too.

So I then thought vengeance was only on my hands. It was my duty to destroy those bees if it was the last thing I did. My little brother on the other hand, thought he would take it upon himself.
Today, Thompson and I are over and my little brother decides now is the time.
I was thinking maybe get some serious bee killer in a can. I'd spray em then watch their little bee faces flying drunkenly and screaming ""Why?! WHY?!?!"" and I'd just say ""Hey man. You brought me to this. You took violence first. It was an accident throwing a rock on your boys, but instead of coming out like a good neighbor and asking ""Hey, what's with the rock genius?' , maybe we could have spoken and squashed the beef. but NO, some asshole had to be a tough guy. Your communication skills suck. I hope you choke.""
My little brother on the other hand. His final attempt came in the form of gasoline in a Super Soaker and a sparkler.
When Chris and I saw the flames we ran outside and saw him squirting gas into the fire. All of a sudden the fire starts to climb the house and we're like ""Holy shit! Put it out!"" Then he says ""I got it under control."" Thinking he was going to grab the hose, no, he actually continued to spray gas on it for about another 5 seconds.
After he says ""Man, I hope those black spots come off the house.""
Yeah.


I'm going to be jumping out of a plane at 14,000 feet."

"event","So this is a strange and hilarious occurrence.
Right now it is very late on Thurs. night.
During slumber on Weds. night, Rob and I had a strange coincidence. We both had dreams where Brian was being really fucked up to me. I shall explain.

First off, Rob and I see each other...basically, every day. So ya know, we talk a lot. We rarely talk about dreams we've had. Not cause they're not important or that we don't have them, just that, it doesn't really come up much. And if we do, it's most likely about girls.

So I had my dream about Brian. Mine wasn't so much about the details. It was actually me, B, and Tory somewhere. I think Boston. But we were trying to catch a train like home somewhere, but I didn't know I was going so I wanted to run back to the house we stayed at and get my things. Blah blah blah, so that lead into Brain completely bitching me out cause I was going to be late and how I was always late for everything. Then it just went from there. Basically, it was just Brian yelling at me and just being the biggest asshole ever and I was pist off. Oh man, he was such a dick. 
So I woke up and remembered it and he was just such an unexplainable asshole in my dream that I thought ""Damn. That was nuts."" Basically cause Brian has never in both our little lives bitched me out for anything ever and has never been a sincere dick to me ever in real life, so I wouldn't know what that would look like if he ever did. So my dream just kind of made it up and it was nuts.
I knew also that after I woke that was the kind of dream that I would have ended up telling someone about cause it made no sense and was crazy, that no doubt if Brian had called me that day I would have told him.

Later today Rob's in my kitchen and out of no where blurts out. ""Oh man, I had this fuckin dream last night where Brian sold your virginity on ebay????? Holy shit.""
So in Rob's dream, I was actually no where in it. Something about they were at a bar and Brian says all the drinks are on him. Then he whips out this HUGE wad of money and says that he sold my virginity on ebay and that wad was just what was left over cause he already bought himself a new car. So...drinks were on him for everyone.
Hahahahahaaaha!!! Oh man. How B got a hold of my virginity I will never know, but it's good to know that not only did it sell, but sold for a shit load! Hell, that fucker bought a new car and still had bucks to throw all kinds of around...all with the thanks of my sweet ass! But jeez, what kind of friend sells you out like that...literally?

So, I can say I don't often if ever have dreams including Brian that I know of (sorry B, but I wish I had more, you know, like dreams of us up in our mansion we always talk about or ones of us winning the world championship of three-legged break dancing). As as far as Rob says, he says the same ( minus the three-legged break dancing). So what are the chances that in the same night we both have dreams involving Brian doing completely fucked things to me enough that we even mention it to each other?
God, I hope that means nothing at all. Most likely doesn't.

But how bout this too...
Brian, the car-less wonder, that same night that Rob had a dream of Brian finally buying himself a car, that day, he actually did buy himself a car. Yup. We didn't know. I only found out after I called him this evening to hang out and told him about the dreams and he then told me he really did buy himself a car. Yesterday. Ryan Cyr's old car. 

Hmph.

I guess that just means Rob and I harness powers greater than everyone else. Guess we'll just have to rule the world or something. A shame too. I would have been happy just to be a farmer."

Previously, last night while sleeping, dream I did. Dreamt I did? I, ................
Do you want Carla in real time?!? At that very moment I had to stop typing because sitting here in my skivvies I noticed another one of those blood sucking bastards on my leg and had to run to my room to fetch my lesbian mini-leatherman, unfold, needle nose plier style and yank that lyme diseased free loader what he had comin to him.
CHRIST!! That is the second one this week. Second of the summer. Deer ticks too. Not the woody ones. I hate, LOATHE those things. INCREDIBLY!
Still hungry?
Anywho, so I (still grossed out) I had a dream where I was somewhere for something, with...some people, and I was eating chicken wings. Thats all. Picnic maybe? But I was eatin wings and they were delicious.
So I awake, tumble round the house. Later that evening dinner time arrives and I'm rubbin my belly, ""Mom's gonna bar-b-q some burgers. I don't feel that. What do I want?.....oh, definitely."" A very simple decision. So mom's even gives me some dollars once I tell her of my plans so everyone else can go in onz too. I call up TK's and place an order. Drive me there, pick up 40 wings, 3 different flavors, drive em on home.
Sitting out on my deck, cool breeze a blowin in my hatted hair, reasonable shade brought on by the covering Chinese Chestnut trees, a glass of pink lemonade, no straw...and TK's to my disposal at the comfort of my own abode.
It was something wordless....ok, frankly, maybe not, but it sure was grand.

Ahhh, well. I should be going. Tomorrow morning I'm leaving with the fam for that exotic get-a-way vacation. Boston, Massachusetts. I can't wait for the clear blue waters and natural beauty!! 
It should be fun though. I've never actually been a real tourist there before. Maybe I'll learn something.
I must say, what I'm concerned about the most this family vacation....is my garden and plants getting watered. Seriously. I tend to them almost every day and I'll be damned if I don't come out with some kind of vegetable when I'm done. Just one fuckin tomato, one fuckin pumpkin (white pumpkins that is), one eggplant, cucumber, jalapeno, cayenne, yellow pepper, spaghetti squash, habanero...SOMETHING, come on, one of those suckers has got to sprout something eatable!! Hey, I did get my first flower I planted from seed the other week. Yeah, maybe if I invested some time in researching what I was growing I would have know that <b>MORNING GLORY'S ONLY BLOOM ONCE FOR ABOUT 18 HOURS THEN THEY DIE!!!</b> At least I actually caught one of the flowers during it and took a picture, no kidding, I was so proud. I grew that baby from seed, little did I know that about 5 hours from then it was going to be half withered. 
Bottom line, Cristina hates, LOATHES my plants. She hated living with them. She hates, LOATHES coming to my house and me showing her the progress my trees have made. She HATES when I start talking about my plants, about who's doing well, who got a mild case of parasites, who's gonna make a great garnish some day to a mozzarella and tomato stonewich on a toasted baguette.
So although I could have easily asked Rob or Chris to help a sister out and water my plants and garden.... I thought it best if Cristina took the job. It'll do her good. Bring her closer to nature. A chlorophyll compadre. 
AH AH AHHHHHH!!

AND FEED MY FISH, BITCH! His name is DAVIS, he won't respond to anything else and if he asks you if ""...these scales make me look fat?"" the answer is always 'no'. No matter what.

Later bitches!"

"event","So...
Ok. So I just wrote two large paragraphs and purposely deleted them. They were about how I got to drive Rob's beast of a truck. About how that time I stripped my own oil pan changing my oil, how I broke the cover of the air filter last week when I went to change the air filter and how today when I went to change a simple tail brake light, everyone concluded to me that the wiring on my car must be fucked and I need to take it to a dealership....that actually wasn't my fault at all...but...
then I decided that even if it is slightly amusing, that was just like two large paragraphs too many about cars...and I don't really want to talk about cars after all. At all.

So...you know what I do want to talk about? My growing habit of sleep walking!!
This past weekend Thompson was being the RD for our old dorms and I went up and stayed in the dorms with him for the weekend. So the first night there, seeing he had to stay in the dorms at night time, we got beers and drank them in his room and played guitar and just fucked around in the dorm. Then I went to sleep. I had Cristina's Aerobed. There was one sheet laid across covering it, then I had two sheets to sleep under. All I remember is very vaguely, I felt like I was trying to get up off the Aerobed for some reason, but I was having a really hard time. I couldn't see and I kept bumping into things. I barely remember, cause well, I was still asleep really. I just remember having a really, really hard time. And that's it. Then I woke up kinda for real, cause I was cold, so I went to reach under me and pull the sheet that was covering the mattress off so I could put that on top of me too. Then I realized it wasn't there, so I fully woke up and started looking around. Where the fuck did it go? Finally I see at the opposite end of the room, is the under sheet. Wrapped up in a ball. In the far opposite corner. ??? Why the hell would I do that?  I didn't like ralph on it or anything, just for no reason, in my sleep. I physically got up, removed both the sheets I was sleeping under, then removed the cover sheet, walked all the way across the room, wrapped it in a ball, left it there, got back in bed, and got under the other two sheets again. What the hell is my problem? Who knows what else I did. For all I know I could have taken that sheet, tied it around my neck pretending to be superman and ran around the dorm halls for hours. Who would know? Thompson slept threw the whole thing. I also realized the next day, and even now, my entire left knee cap is one big bruise, so I guess I was having a hard time getting out of bed and bumping into shit. Man, I need someone to monitor me when I sleep. I'm a weirdo.

Ehh, enough about me.
So here's more pictures.
These are from April I believe, when Thompson and I went hiking at Osborndale Park in Derby. 
I'll narrate under pictures when necessary.
 <lj-cut text=""Under this one. For sure."">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v59/vsvictrolavs/dogskeleton1.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Well, I'm sorry if it seems I have a trend with dead animals. I don't know. It just happens. So after hiking for about an hour and a half we thought we had just walked over the small valley hill and we were going to come out on the other side of the park. We actually ended up in someone's farm backyard. It was kinda creepy there. Then we found a dog skeleton. I'm pretty definite on it being a dog. Not only by the parts we found and the size and shape, but also the fur we later saw. That place had tons of hawks around that I'm sure could have picked it apart and no doubt that there's probably coyotes as well. We were lost so we had to find the streets and find our way back cause it was getting dark...and creepier.

Just white leaves we found still attached to trees. A forrest of leafless trees, then two with white ones. Sweet.

In the back of the farm were a bunch of canadian geese. This one had a yellow collor around it's neck with numbers. Maybe he was a refugee from Goose Jail, ya know, the Big House. Doing time for crime. Now, since he's the only distinguishable goose of the bunch, they made him the leader. And he's hard cause he's got prison tattoos under his feathers, so he started a gang and they're the one's that really killed the dog. It was a turf war. The dog was wearing the wrong colors on the wrong side of the pond. Yeah.

Throughout our hike we kept coming upon these index cards with crazy Dungeons and Dragons like things written on them. Some kind of role playing game. In the woods. I don't know. I don't think I have anything exceptionally polite to say about who ever was probably playing these games, so I just won't say anything at all.

Then I shoved Thompson into a fireplace and he freaked out.

"event","So thus continues revisited photos.
These are a few from when Thompson and I went skating this year on the first, available warm day possible.
We were out for hours. We skated all the way from his house, past the beach to the ass end of Lordship. All the way to the sea wall. Marnicks was open, he got soft serve and I got one of those generic, tri-color, premade snow cones that eventually just turns purple at the end....and I loved every second of it.
<lj-cut text=""I'm gonna put this in a cut cause it's got a few pictures and that makes it kind of long. Don't wanna hog the internet space, ya know. But it's amusing."">
This first photo actually has dialog to it. Verbatim.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v59/vsvictrolavs/field.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
=======
""Do you remember what happened in this field?""
............""You got caught smoking pot by the cops when you were like 14.""
""No, that was behind that building next to it...........they found a BODY.""
............"".....ohh.""
""Carla, I wish we could find a body.""
............""Well, wishing never got anyone anywhere. If you have a goal, you need to figure out what you need to do and do it.""
=======

Then there was this.

I can't help but think how he must have died to land like that. That's exactly how we found him. I'm sure he went to heaven. He was posing for it.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v59/vsvictrolavs/crates2.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

And in this picture, if you look to the left at the white building, and then that small group of those red poles, theres a small white spot on the ground, that's actually the sea gull.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v59/vsvictrolavs/crates3.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

And in this picture if you look in the same spot, there's Thompson just finding it while I'm across the lot taking pictures of milk crates. I just figured that out for the first time about an hour ago when I was looking at em again.

http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/bandrelationsair/album?.dir=/610c&.view=t

Also, along with those pictures in this album is another picture that holds a story that I didn't want to just post directly cause of people viewing at work...
So near the beach in Stratford, that area between Long and Short beach, the marsh land with the one...lone...road that has nothing on either side but about a mile of beach marsh save for a small airport in the middle of it.... 
So we're skating on it and it's a very windy day and on the other side the road we see a big black bag just flapping. We both kinda stopped and looked at it again for some reason. Then we both noticed the bag said ""PENTHOUSE"" on it and Thompson says ""What do you think's holding that bag down?"" ""I don't know."" So we skate back to it and Thompson grabs it by the end and dumps it out. There it was. In the package, a large, detailed to life, 55 dollar, balls included, rubber penis. I think the best part was, well, you know how Thompson does weird things on a whim or under pressure, for some reason he immediately threw his jacket on it, picks it up wrapped in the jacket and brought it over to me. ??? So we're both like ""What the hell? Why is this here? And why is it still in the package?"" Thompson starts messing with it and the package opens right up. It's clear it was opened before. So he drops it back on the grass on the side of the road. Then we just looked at it and wondered what the story was and how did it ever get there. I mean, that road. If you ever wanted to get rid of something and didn't want anyone to see, that would be a place to do it. So weird.

Then I took a picture of it. You know, for documentation purposes.

"event","So I know between Cristina, Elizabitch, Jasmine and Brenna's journals, the stories and events of this weekend will be told over and over. So while I'm here, I'm going do it first, because frankly, I'm an asshole.
But no, I'll actually leave out all detail and let that to everyone else.
In short form.
I ended up making it to Boston far earlier that I was originally supposed to and ended up at the dyke bar.
Surprised my bitches. Drank. Slept.
Woke up. Went to a triple birthday brunch, the heart breaking trifecta, Elizabitch, Brenna and Laura.
After, 9 of us made a stop at the lesbo block party in JP. Very hot. Can't dance. Too hot.
Then previous 9 to bar-b-q with central air at Brenna and Jasmine's.
Chicken with a beer can up it's ass.

I drove home.

It was fun. Fun like fat in a can. (that's a great kind of fun.)

Between those two days I think I've seen enough lesbians to last me for the next 8 months. I don't need to see another. So if you're a lesbian and you want to see me, you'll have to talk to my secretary and set up a meeting for next February. Which is my birthday month. So bring lots of gifts.
You know, unless of course you're one of my bitches, in which case my calender is always open.


Anyways, well, Boston pretty much owns me for the rest of June as well. Thompson is helping our old dorms and working as the RD for a week so I'll prob be up there to hang with him this weekend. Then I'll be up there for the entire last week of June till July 3rd. Wanna know why? Oh, I'll tell ya. For FAMILY VACATION. I know! What the fuck?!?
How that came to be. So about 5 months ago-ish, my mom's talking about taking a fam vacation this year. She was suggesting Virginia, which is cool, I never been there. Then she mentions how much my step dad and step brother like Boston so much. Ok, well, I lived there for 3 years, not much of an adventure, but whatever, no need to pull vacation plans I'm not paying for around me. So she, just for the hell of it, starts browsing online. Playing with priceline.com, trying to get a feel of how much hotels are going for in different areas, whatnot of those likes. Then shes says ""Ummmm. So....I....guess we're going to Boston then."" So my moms put in a small bid on an area in Boston for a hotel, not thinking they would except...and they did. 2 rooms at the Park Plaza in Downtown for like $50 bucks a night for like a week. I think thats absolutely insane. 

So that's that. 
It's hot in here.
So I'm gonna go take off *most* of my clothes.
Night."

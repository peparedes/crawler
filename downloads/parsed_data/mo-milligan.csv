ummm
i ran out of time for this thing...bahhh.ummm but life is going good if you wanted to know. i feel really busy though. as soon as i find a moment of relaxation i take it and run with it. its like your alarm going off at 6:30 and hitting snooze just so you can sleep 5 more minutes... why? its not like 5 more minutes is gonna make a difference. i do that all the time. oh well
tonight i get to relax which is exciting.

i have time to update today
this weekend was good
friday i went to see mr.3000 and went out to dinner with my daddy then stayed up just so i could hear how the game went. when i heard it was really upseting.... but its okay that game was literally stolen from cox. oh well
saturday i went to the gun show with my daddy that wasn't real productive well..... it was for him but not for me it was really boring and i spent all my time looking at things pretending that i know what they are.
then i went to case money's and helped her set up for her birfday partay
it was good times then i went home with mallory and had a sleepover. It was bunches of fun and except we went to bed at like 3 or 4 and i woke up at 7 to go to church ahhh! but church was loads of fun. then i came home and did homework and jank.

school today was school
i am really happy ms. newill is lightening up on the workload...she was goin crazy for a while. after school ap psyc review was realllly short. suprisingly. now its time to do some more  homework  then make dinner and then go to this bible study jank with tess and jules.

"event","late last night i got an unexpected visit from LP and Jules. And together we had a discussion about guys(rar)and other things one thing led to another and i ended up learning some very important things. 

1- You never know the WHOLE story
2- People LIE
3- You may have more in common with friends then you know 
4- boys mess with your head
5- at 16 its much bettter to focus on other things rather than the typical boy crazy
6- Lp and jules rule
7- Girls should never call guys
8- Chilvary is dying and coming very close to being extinct
9- I really like Chilvary
10- Never take things too seriously
11- Highschool is almost over
12- I'm growing up 
13- I really have nothing to complain about at all
14- I really like people that are straight up with you
15- Fake People make me sick
16- Arguments are petty
17- Talks are good
18- sometimes random phone calls from random people can make my day

take these and learn people
learn memorize and love"

me and ri go to Croc's with her mom and her mom's friend and you're spos'd to get carded when you walk in if you look under 21.and we def. did not get carded. it was a horrible experience. Bars smell so bad and there are some freaks in there.So i came home around 10ish sat around didn't do to much. then taylor came over at like midnight. and we watched tv and almost passed out. due to drowsiness. friday morning i woke up and did mass laundry and some dishes thenn LP and chez picked me up and we ran a few errands. then when i got home from that i cleaned the WHOLE HOUSE.(minus my room) it was ridiculous. but i got paid 25 bucks. then i went to go see Bourne Identity it was really good. then came home for a while then went to dinner. THHEEN went out driving for a while...then went and saw the village. it really wasn't that good. after that came home and sleeept. Saturday morning i got up and worked out with my daddy. Came back to my mom's house with my bro. Made and ate lunch. then went to taylor's to see the bourne identity. it was really good aswell.
then came home got an attempted 5 minutes nap. but it didn't really work. then my dad picked me up and we went to the store then i made dinner for the both of us. I made fleshki and broccli. Its preety much egg noodles, and diced ham with butter and seasonings. Then hottubed for about 2 hours. i was kinda sore. then watched some intense softball. then went to bed. TODAY went to church , went to steph's now cleaning up and watching christian(steph's son) while momma dukes is at the store.today is a family cookout which looks to be quite tasty.
much love.

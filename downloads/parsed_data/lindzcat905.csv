"event","Hey Guys~!
    I leave Saturday as in 3 days from today!! I'm so excited lol.
  Alright we def. had the best girls night ever Emily is the funniest person i have ever met in my whole life! Poor Rach! Anyways on our way home from Hyde's katie started talkin about how she was comfortable with herself and emily and kayla agreed. How can everyone be so comfortable with themselves and i cant? When i say that i feel so shallow but its the truth i'm no comfortable with myself and i dont know who i am really. somtimes i feel so lost. I guess from the JKB trip i want to become comfortable with myself and trust my friends and learn who my true friends are and aren't. Sometimes i trust the people i shouldnt and dont trust the people i should. I feel like i've hurt so many people without even thinking twice. I'm afraid to do what my heart tells me because of who i might hurt or even worse because what if i'll regret it in the long run. WHAT IF I MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE? what would i do? Sometimes i think ok your only a junior in highschool and then i think ok your almost out of highschool and about to start your life in college. That thought to me is the scariest thing i've ever thought about. What if i dont have the grades to get into college what if i get stuck in hamilton for the rest of my life. i feel so trapped in hamilton. I love all my friends here but i just feel like there is somthin more out there for all of us. I dont know one of them who wants to stay here each and everyone of them have big ideas of what they want to be and who the want to be. i hope that they all get what they want in life and that i do too. 
 Alright i feel completely drained lol so i'm gonna go to volleyball
                    LoveAlways

"event","Hey guys today is so dreary. I hate it when it rains it puts me in total chill mode and i never get anything done. And lately i've been thinkin about so many things. i wish i could jus push all of it away and go with the flow. I wish things could jus go back to the way they were in the 9th grade. everyone was just becoming friends and everyone liked eachother. now there is so much drama between people. We all cant hang out anymore with out somethin gettin started. I'm so tierd of people getting up in my relationships. They only mess things up even worse then they are now. Yea i understand i've been cheated on twice you dont need to throw it my face in front of people especially when i'm not even there. I mean damn who asked you anyway? to the person who this is about knows who they are. 
 Anyways.....yesterday my aunts calls and my cousin is engaged to a girl my age. for cryin out loud he jus graduated lol. whats the rush? yea he's in love but if its for real they can wait and it will last. i dont want to see him ruin his life so early. and i'm not sayin that by marrying her it will ruin his life but its cutting it short. I just want him to be happy.
 So many things have happened lately and i just needed an outlet. Sometimes i feel so left out and alone. It seems like everyone has someone i mean kara rach and ash jube and em katie sally and kayla and i'm the loner. this is so pathetic lol i have friends i know but sometimes i jus feel left out. i mean i called sally and she didnt bother to tell me that she was having everyone stay at her house for girls night. that was so nice of her lol. o well its not like she ever hangs out w/us really anyway. I feel like everyone only calls me when they dont have anyone else to call. But i'll be ok. i have so many things to look forward to. Theres no use lookin at the past what happens happens. All my girls i love you guys so much if you ever need anything you know i'm here. 
                       Love Always

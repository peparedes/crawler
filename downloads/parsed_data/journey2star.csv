I&#39;ve added push ups to my strength routine after discovering I can still do one in good form and touch my nose to the ground. I don&#39;t want to loose that ability so... My big problem with push ups is when I start doing more the 10 at a time my wrists kill me. I&#39;m eyeing some push up bars to remedy that (so my wrist isn&#39;t at a 90 degree angle when I do them). Things I&#39;ve read&nbsp;snuggest&nbsp;that should help. Maybe always wear braces as well.

I am also trying to eat better a bit. Although forming my&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;habit takes&nbsp;precedence. I have a chart of daily wight goals, slowing going lower until I&#39;m at 145 by April 13th. I&#39;m well within these goals so I figure if I keep on&nbsp;exercising&nbsp;and eat&nbsp;moderately&nbsp;I can reach my goals without any hard core dieting.&nbsp;

15% fat means as of right now I need to loose 20lbs of fat. I may have to&nbsp;reassess /that/&nbsp;goal when I get closer to it because that means,&nbsp;forgetting&nbsp;any&nbsp;muscle&nbsp;gain, I would be 130 which I&#39;ve never been at my current&nbsp;height. But that&#39;s further down the road..."

"event","Since I&#39;ve posted here I&#39;ve fallen off the wagon... got back on, kept going for two months... then fell off again when school and work got hectic. So I&#39;m ready for another go!! This time I&#39;m going to take it real slow. My past mistake has been to give in to my starting&nbsp;enthusiasm and then burn out. I&#39;ve&nbsp;written&nbsp;out a schedule of mixed strength, stationary bike, and yoga. Again, I&#39;m taking it easy and starting small. Also I&#39;m going to exercise&nbsp;every day. Not super&nbsp;intense&nbsp;everyday, one day a week (Sunday) is my lazy day when I&#39;ll do something very light like a walk. The idea is I&#39;m just forming a habit right now while getting my body used to this.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&#39;m pleased that some half&nbsp;hearted&nbsp;yoga I did&nbsp;sporadically&nbsp;over the past three weeks are&nbsp;actually&nbsp;showing results. I did a flow today and was going much deeper then normal.&nbsp;<br /><br />My short term goal right now is to&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;every day for a month. I&#39;ve been doing this so far since Saturday (10/8). So my deadline is 11/8.<br /><br />My long term goal is to be 15% body fat by my wedding. I also want to increase strength in my upper&nbsp;shoulders and core.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&#39;m dropping the marathon pipe dream because truly, I don&#39;t like to run all <i>that&nbsp;</i>much. I like it some but... However I&#39;ve been eyeing other events that are more ADD (triathlon&nbsp;or&nbsp;obstacle&nbsp;coarses such as warrior dash) geared so if I&#39;m still going strong after four months I&#39;ll look into some sort of event.<br />"

"event","Life and more recitnely mono have gotten in the way of my exersizing but I'm ready to hop back on. I've downloaded the Power 90 work out dvds and I'm thats my foacus right now. The videos are a bit boring but its a good mix of strength, flexabilty, and cardio. And I'm told what to do for 90 days. So the only thing I need to think about is when to do it every day, and to have the modivation. If I manage this I'll move on to the p90x videos, and then I may work towards that marthon goal. So if I stick to things I have the next six mounths planed out for exersize. Wich is a bit intemadating but I feel like it is a relaistic system that will help me reach my goal of 15% fat, which is half of my current number. With the help of a nifty spread sheet I even have a good way to keep track of my progress. I have some hand weights that will do for now but I need to buy some tension bands. 

My stats....
Weight 160.00 
Body Fat % 31.75 
Fat Mass 50.79 
Lean Mass 109.21 

I did take a day one picture but I'm not putting that up unless I reach the end of the program. Then I'll do a cheesy before and after summery."

"event","So yes, MARATHON. Right now I'm just working on running in genneral. I ran solid for two weeks but wasn't so good this past one (only ran once). But I'll be good now. One week on my ass isn't so bad. And in fact I wasn't on my ass... I was too out of it from volentering because things are especaly buissy over there. But that will get better after this week and I can focus on running again. I've been good about yoga but the wieght lifting as fallen to the side, I'll do that again in a few weeks. Running, then yoga, then wieghts. At some point I'll be doing all three with regularity... one day. By the running schedule I'm following I should be able to start marathon training in eight weeks. So that's early November. We'll see if that's what happens. 

I'm contemplating how I want to treat myself for reaching my goals. I'm thinking a petacure for reaching the eight week mark. And new running shooes, I'll need them by then.

The more I run though the more it I feel a bit over wealmed. I'm giving myself about a year and a half to prepare for this but damn if over 26 miles isn't a long way to run."

"event","I did some yoga and soaked in the&nbsp;tub&nbsp;yesterday and am so happy that I did. I feel so much less sore. I've been feeling tense and in paine for the past few days; which I atribute to the sudden change in my sleep pattern and classes. I'm so used to associating failer with school that I freaked out a bit and did more work then was nessasary. I was supper stressed, however, I am now ahead. It took me a while to do yoga becasue I kept equating it to more convetional exersize, which can feel like real work. I'd forgoten how much it serves to relax me.&nbsp;<br /><br />So yes, some yoga then a soak in the tub. I think that will become more common. Saves on water anyway, considering how long my showers are.<br /><br />Still just eating like I always do. Just avoiding extra butter and mayo, things like that. The more I look at my normal diet the more I realize that I don't have to make any darastic changes, just take out a few fats and add a&nbsp;serving of fruit to breakfust and lunch. Maybe I sould ask mom to buy some baby carots for another serving of veg for a snack. I should probily start making my sandwich for lunch with schwartsbrot but I'm not quite yet ready to chew on that&nbsp;bark. XP<br /><br />oh and here is what the government says we should be eating&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mypyramid.gov/"">http://www.mypyramid.gov/</a>&nbsp;there is a link on the right that says ""my pyramid plan"" ware you enter some info and yea."

Althogh I have read more then I've posted I know I havn't reached that. I don't think I'll even pretned to atempt that this year. One there are more important things and two I read on my own so its not realy nessisary.

And so we all get back on the big hampster wheel eh? I admit I havn't been doing much to realize this. I've been making more of an effort to make shure I don't just go with out food untill dinner, as is the tendency when I have school. I haven't been exersizing but I have a mind to do some yoga after class, my neck is killing me.&nbsp;

I suppose this years goals involv getting money together for Japan. Getting good grades. And getting fit (yes, again =P)

I'm more foacasing on that second aspect right now, the first will come after, and the third, well thats time management."

But I'm going to try to learn from my orginal mistake. I tried to change my habits too quikly then got overwealmed and droped the idea altogether. SOOO starting tomarow I am setting a personal goal to to exersize every day except friday for 40-60 min for twenty-one days. This may either be yoga, ddr, running, or whatever I feel like so long as its exersize. I'm not going to worry about what I eat right now. My normal diet isn't that bad anyhoo. The idea is by then exersizing will be a habbit, so doing so /and/ changing my diet wont be so mentaly strenuious. 

so twenty-one days = three weeks from tomaorw = october 17

I'll post about my progress at least once a week... so here i go!"

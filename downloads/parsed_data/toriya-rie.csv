"event","yes, that's right, I don't think there's any way my foot is going to heal before the year starts, so I won't be dancing for a while at any rate. You ladies will be beautiful snowflakes and flowers etc... I'll come to the show, so you better do a good job for me! If you do an extra good job I'll buy you a flower. As for marching band... I think I should be okay mostly... Anyhow, I must go to the doctor soon to do *something* about it... incompetent doctors. I'm going to watching Crouching Tiger tonight, then I have to wake up early tomorrow to babysit Monster 1 and 2. Ah well, it gives me time to work on the AP assignments."

I got an anti-inflammatory prescription today, so maybe that's all it is... but I'm pretty sure it's not. damn. o well. Other than that, I have to start working on my AP assignment, because time is running out, and I'm slow, and it is extremely boring and difficult for me. another big sigh and o well. I guess that's all for now... nobody reads this anyways... I only write here when I'm really bored."

I'm an okay driver, and I think I did very well for my first time driving stick and clutch and whatnot in a 12 year old car. so that's that. I think I'm going out driving again in a little bit, so woo hoo! have a good day :D"

"event","today, we were planning on going to the DMV to take my permit test, but the patriarch has delayed it until tomorrow. I kind of wanted to get it, and get out on the road! but no. I'm also kind of nervous, because I'm stupid and I'll probably fail, even though I hear it's an easy test. I've been taking those practice quizzes online, and they're pretty easy... mostly common sense. some people say they're really tough though. O well, we'll just have to wait and see. watch out world, Victoria will [hopefully] be on the road tomorrow!!"

"event","today was the jazz show. I'd say it went very well... excellent job, ladies! I'll see you all next fall, hopefully rejoining the junior company... I know you guys need me, heh heh. no, but seriously, next year is going to be very tough, what with AP world history, which is hear is horrible, and marching band, there is no way I will be able to keep up with my current dance schedule. so, if that's the case, sorry girls, Pointe II is down to 3, ahh!!! O well, we'll see. So hopefully tomorrow I'm going bowling wit mah girls. I just watched You Got Served, and I really enjoyed it. Gooood stuff. I really want to take some hip hop classes. I want to learn how to break dance!! Today, you suckas got served. OoOooOoOh snap!!!! The hip hop at the jazz show was awesome! I need to learn how to do those ""C-jumps"", as it were. So cool.... I think I got it figured out, now I just need a big space to practice, with nobody looking, just in case, heh heh. and also my foot needs to get better, so I can jump. listen to me complain... it's shameful. so I'm done. you suckas got served!"

"event","yes, that's right. my foot is KILLING me....... no, not literally. you people. when I walk, it really hurts, but when I'm sitting still it's okay. after dancing or something, it hurts like hell, and even when I'm just sitting it's like throbbing. I don't think that's normal. and I wish we had some real food in our house. we have nothing healthy. I've been eating pasta and fat for the last few days, and that's no good. I'm trying to be more healthy, but it's a problem when I love pasta, and that's all we have. We also have chicken nuggets, but I can only eat so many dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets. dance will be over after tomorrow, so hopefully I will have more time to prepare myself healthy meals, and also some time to heal. goodness knows I need it. I suppose if I don't get better soon, especially since I'm not dancing, I should see a doctor. there's probably nothing wrong with my foot. geez. whatever! this is ridiculous. my foot probably hurts from my lack of nutritious food. o well. I didn't sign up for jazz this year, but I took like 3 jazz classes pretty consistently anyways [heh heh], so I got to be sort of an understudy, since I knew all the dances. so this girl dropped out, so I am filling in. 'twill be mucho fun.... even though it's an adult class, so everyone in the class isn't very good, and they're not very fun to be around... but Mrs. McElhaney put me in the backstage dressing room just because my other friends are there! thanks for that! whew, I should get to sleep. jazz show tomorrow... not too early... it's ""summer-early"". Good nigt, all."

I wake up, eat lots of food, feel myself fattening, do nothing, maybe read and watch tv, then go to sleep and start all over agian. I'm going to see Dodgeball tomorrow, so that will be fun. Who knows, maybe I'll even start writing in this, even though nobody reads it. I do it simply to entertain myself, and I really should find something else to do, because this only takes up about 3 minutes. 'Tis a shame.

"event","I'm soo busy right now. I'm trying to get some homework done before I go to Orlando for the band trip, but as you can see, I'm not working. Ah well, it happens. I won't end up doing any of it on the trip, and I'll be totally swamped when I get back. The trip is going to be so much fun. I'm kind of mad about my traiterous buddy... and also my lack of friends... haha! Good friends are few and far between I've found. I've been in such a bad mood lately. I want everything to be black and plain. Bright colors make me mad, except red, because that is an angry color, haha! I'm so excited about our trip though. ROLLER COASTERS! HURRAY! I'm such a roller coaster freak, and I need a good buddy that will ride all of them with me. Weeelll, I should go do some homework, I suppose. 
Later darlings!

"event","So I'm feeling rather refreshed after sleeping for like 12 hours. I'm watching a movie with the little ones, and my whole body hurts. I'm in so much pain, it hurts to wash my face. Anyways, hopefully it will get better. Kate & Leopold is a very fun movie. I love Hugh Jackman. O the chivalry. Too bad I didn't live in Medieval times, or during the 18th/19th centuries. Good times. I could marry a knight. Right... anyways, I had a really scary dream last night. One of those dreams that if I told you, it wouldn't sound as terribly horrifying as it really was, because you had to be there. The gist of it was the world was under attack by an army of hideous monsters was like taking over the world, and they had orders to destroy my family. Suffice to say, it was a narrow escape. Geez, I wish the weather would warm up some, so I could go outside on spring break. And I really want to go to the mall and get some new books and CD's. 703.803.3428, call me if you want to do something. Well, have a good spring break, all. Adieu."

Tomorrow is the last day of school before Spring Break! Hurray! Too bad I'm not going anywhere. Ah well, it will be a love time to sleep and relax (and do that stupid geometry SOL review packet).Dancing if I feel better, maybe having a friend over to hang out. That's the extent of my spring break. PARTIES (parties being 1-3 people at my house being bored). Ah well (geez, that's like the third time I've said that), I am going to go lie down and die... I didn't do anything today for April Fools. I told somebody my hair caught on fire, but that's it, and I don't really count that. Well then, I guess I'm done rambling for the time being.O, this just in, skipping school tomorrow. Just until sixth period I think, but if I'm not doing anything I might not go in at all. I'll decide tomorrow. Get an early start on Spring Break. I am feeling kind of sick though, so it's probably good for me. And now I can stay up late reading... wait, I have to turn my essay in tomorrow. O well, I'll...hm. This is a problem. Well, I'll figure something out. My teacher doesn't even have her own classroom, so I'll have to track her down. No, I'll see if I can go in for the end of fourth period, that will work. Sweet deal! Okay, no more prattle (vocab word)."

I didn't go today because my parents' meeting ran over. It's gonna be weird, since I already told everybody that I was going to be there. Today BB said she would not be going to Orlando. GEEZ! This trip is going downhill. First, my room group got split up, and the other half of my group is stuck with a bunch of Koreans. Not that that's bad, but they will be kind of left out, since those girls only speak in Korean (nothing against Koreans :P ). Anyways, at least I am still with one friend, and I don't know who else is in my room. It won't be the same without BB... hopefully she can talk to her dad and maybe still go. O well, it will be fun regardless. Not as fun. Geez, I want to cry. There is so much going on. Dance all day tomorrow... and costume fittings. But I'm excited because I'm having like an old friend reunion next Friday (yeah Nanee)! It's gonna be great! Haha, time to kick some Scrabble ass! Wow, I'm hungry. I only had 35 cents, so I bought some cookies from the vending machines and split them with my little brother (he might as well be cookie monster, the fiend). This was obviously at school. It was so sad, he kept telling me he wanted to go home, and ""where's Mommy? Let's go find Mommy"" I felt bad. Ah well. Haha, so far, all of my entries have been me being angry or blah. And this one is irate, haha. I guess I really am an angry person. It's a shame, because I really am very nice, haha."

"event","Today went by soooo slow. Unbelievably so, in fact. I woke up and it was so cold, I didn't want to leave my room (which was warm because of the floor heater). Unfortunately, I somehow ended up at school, once again. In gym, I didn't play volleyball again. Leah and I have been sorting papers instead of playing for the past week, haha. Mr. Ewell is cool like that... unless he's really been giving us 0's for each day and still having us sort papers. Geez, that would not be cool. I'd be rather angry, as it were. My English teacher is such a retard. Today, she was handing back papers, and she took off credit for not doing work she told us not to do. Did she not realize that everybody in the class-save like one person (yeah, whatever, Liz)-didn't have it done. And she was giving answers to the quiz and she got them wrong. Good thing some of the students know the material better than she does; They saved my grade :P So yeah, that made me mad. And then she assigns a ton of homework, which once again I should be doing right now. I really ought to get started on that essay, but I have to find like 10000 stupid quotes from Beowulf. Way to suck. [sigh] o well, jazz tonight (only since my dad won't take me to my [favorite] ballet class). Jazz is fun, but I wish I could take that ballet class. I will probably start going straight from school and hanging out at Pizzarama... at least there is that awesome guy that works in the kitchen, haha."

I have to go to dance in a little bit, but I got new pointe shoes, so hurray! Ugh, so much to do. Too bad there's not enough time in a day. Days should be 48 hours, but only for a little while so I can catch up on some sleep. I could live my normal day, then sleep for 24+ hours. But if the days were long like that for too long they would extend school hours and they would start giving us more homework, which would completely defeat the purpose. Thus, 48 hours per day for a month, before they have time to do anything. I just started reading Under A War-Torn Sky. It's pretty good. I wonder if I'll have time to read it this week."

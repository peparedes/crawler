<i>""'ve come undone and all hopes of mending<br>me are gone because the pain took my soul.<br>Can't you see?  The only one who can put me<br>back together again is me.""</i>

The Rose Petals are associated with sorrow,<br>reflection, and wisdom.  They are governed by<br>the goddess Persephone and their sign is The<br>Teardrop, or Broken Love.

As a Rose Petal, you are always self-reflective and<br>may be hard on yourself.  You probably have<br>been hurt in the past by other people and can<br>sometimes distance yourself, as a result.  You<br>don't usually let other get too close to you,<br>but you are very good at mending your spirits<br>back together by yourself.

"event","it's been a while since i wrote in this thing.  what can i say-- i been busy.  get off me.

well since last time we've had finals week, spring break, and the first two weeks of spring quarter classes, so i'll try to pretty much sum all that up.

finals week was... typical, i guess.  except that breakfast for a buck really SUCKED.  not like people who don't like grits seeing that they serve grits and getting grossed out sucked... i mean like u get half the food as before and most of it is Mystery Sausage.  
my classes ended up being pretty good... acceptable anyways.  i had the exact same GPA as fall quarter 04.  and even if that's not that good, it's good cuz it's not that bad. yeah that's how it works.
ok check out the finals week quoteboard... the second to last EVER, and certainly the last one to include gems from our lovely buddies nicole and jackie.  ::sniff::

and that's that.  i realized i'm a person who likes to record remotely funny statements and post them as ""quoteboards.""  i did it again, you'll see in a minute.  in case you didn't notice in the quotes... i did cut off my thumb.  it's OK now... but it was scary for a minute there. i had to go to the ER and everything... eek.  and btw it was NOTHING like the tv show. 

sooo... let's see, what else happened?  OH our chapter has 4 looooovely neos:

Line Three: The FOURmidable Legacy
<img src=""http://tinypic.com/dwqck7.jpg"">
Right to left: #1 Lijia Evariz, #2 Yvette Cebrian, #3 Heather Schwartz, and #4 Ana Valenzuela

i love you guys! :)  so me and yo went on spring break, and it was even more eventful than we hoped.  it turns out yo's window got busted and two suitcases were stolen, including all of yolanda's and yvette's clothing.  yeah u read right-- we were BROKEN INTO.  it was kinda unreal... so we drove all the way to cleveland with a garbage bag on the window and got it fixed there.  and we got pulled over on the way and had a hard time convincing the cop that yes, yolanda owned the car and no, we didn't bust the window and steal it and yes, yolanda has a license.  just not on her.  whatever, i hate cops.  where was he when they stole our crap?

anyways we made it to cleveland.  pookie's doing great, by the way.  we spent a couple days at the mall getting yo some clothes and stuff.  then instead of the whole williamsburg thing, we decided to head straight to philly.  oh, did i mention we were driving to philly to catch the sold-out backstreet boys show at the Electric Factory?  i must have.  anyways, we did.  it was HOT, needless to say.  we waited in line, musta been 3 hours, and got in, etc.  it was a really hot show, even though i couldn't hear much.  they played all their old hits, and a bunch of new songs off of Never Gone (title of new album, due out June 14th... yeah, my birthday.  it's not a coincidence.), including their new single Incomplete, which you should be hearing on the radio about now.  
<img src=""http://www.dlsonline.net/freshpictures/albums/Backstreet%20Boys/Pro%20Shots/Incomplete%20Press%20Release/jivepromo.jpg"" alt="""">
if you're starting to think i'm a weirdo right now about this bsb thing... you don't wanna know anything about my 15-18 yr old days.  anyways the concert was da ish, kevin pointed AND waved at me (seriously.), and it was worth every penny/mile/hour.  I'm sure Yo feels the same way, so you don't even have to ask her. Hehe.  

quick spring break quotes, mostly from yo:

""Two dollars and 50 cents!  that's not a toll, that's a shakedown!"" -Yo... that was before we hit the 19.00 toll in Jersey

Indiana Highway Patrolman:  Why were you goin' so fast?
Yolanda: I'm sorry.  I'm in a hurry to get out of your state.  (ok, didn't really happen, but we do hate indiana.)

""OK, i'm going like 66, so if anyone pulls me over, it's cuz I'm black."" -Yo

    ***After being pulled over****

""The back of a cop car, it turns out, is the smallest place ever.  And when you realize that most cops are teeny-tiny little pricks, it doesn't make sense that they get so much leg room up front."" -Yo

Me:  Could a cop do something to you for having an attitude?
Yo:  They could just hit you harder.

Me:  You're going like way below the speed limit.
Yo:  I know.  I don't wanna miss the one place in New Jersey where you can make a left turn.

""God, does everyone who's Puerto Rican call themselves the Freakin' Puerto Rican?"" -Yo

""OK, we get it.  You walk an empty street, you're the only one and you walk alone.  Instead of Green Day it should be Green Redundant."" -Me


so we came back from philly, stopped off in cleveland, and came back to chicago tired as WHAT.  i mean, i know i was, and i didn't even drive.  so monday morning bsb were on the radio in chicago talkin about their show that night, and guess what... so they were taking listener questions so i call in and i'm like i wanna talk to bsb and they're like ok sure hold on and go back to the interview.  and i'm waiting, waiting... and i hear a weird noise and then a dial tone.  ""omg omg omg noooooooooo"" so i call back.  and get through AGAIN.  i'm like i wanna talk to bsb i think i got disconnected.  they're like ok hold on one sec and go back to the interview.  they're chit chatting with bsb for a while and it starts winding up.  i'm like they better be taking some listener questions to round out the interview.  they weren't.  interview ended, bsb left, and i'm still on hold.  i stayed on the line for like 10 minutes to be sure.  so i'm not a fan of kiss 103.5 right now, except that they play my song. still not enough, but whatev.

anyways, i'm over it.

so since then i've been going to classes... in theory... i had a job interview, yay... i finally finished season 2 of smallville, and did i mention i hate cops? i'm REALLY over them.  not that i was ever under them, smart aleck.

hehe i said smart aleck.  

this was a LOOOOOOONG post but if i do one of these like once a month that sounds about right."

either way, i've completely thrown academics out the window.  i'm in three pretty easy classes this quarter, i'm pretty OK with my GPA and pretty much nothing i do with these last two quarters is going to change it any.  seriously, with the averaging, a grade matters like .0001 by now. besides, i need to find a job, ace the LSATS, and make sure i graduate.

Minneapolis was fun-- we went out a lot.  Places such as some place called Lyons, It's Brothers (what a weird name) some fake karaoke thingie in BlockE, Matt's, the Mall of America, and GameWorks, where I accidentally busted over like 5 glasses all over the dance dance revolution mat.  So much fun.  On New Year's Eve we went to Tonic, where Yo's brother-in-law works and he hooked us up.  Yo lost her phone, making us almost fully unreachable by the outside world.  But it's cool- my new phone should be coming in the mail any day now.

i just started a diet today.  this time i'm combining it with working out, being that SPAC is almost the closest building on campus to my dorm.  i can almost reach out my window and touch it, and yet i still have never worked out there.  i suck.

(usually the older generation, i.e. my parents, aunts and uncles)...

and those who find them DISGUSTING.  I'm in the latter, needless to say.  Ew.  

Chitterlings, a.k.a. Chitlins are a PIG'S small INTESTINE!  Of all the parts of the pig to eat!  And if you've ever been around them, you know what the smell is like.  

<FONT COLOR=""#003300"">My uncle Joe:  What would Thanksgiving be without chitlins?
Me:  It would smell a lot better, for one.

My cousin Kim:  There should be a caution label: WARNING--May cause stankin' breath.

My mom:  You know, you could lose weight eating chitlins.
My brother Andre:  How, by puking 'em back up?</FONT>


Hehe.  We're funny.  Anyways, people kept coming around us with their smelly plates of chitlins and it reminded me of the old saying:

""I am not a Chitlin' eater; 
But a Chitlin' eater's son. 
Someone else can eat de Chitlin's 
'Til de Chitlin' eater comes!""

Food for thought?  Anyways, now I'm fully into the swing of the christmas season.  I've already bought a few presents, I decorated the tree on Friday, and I'm currently in the process of burning the DEFINITIVE Christmas Collection 3-Disc Mix CD.  You name a classic/wonderful/amazing Christmas song, and it's on there.  For 5 bucks, I'll burn you a copy.

According to Electoral-Vote.Com, Since Sept. 1, the total number of polls is 937. Toss in another 252 polls from May 24 to Aug. 31 and we have the most studied election <I>in the history of the world.</I>

Well, i'm supposed to be writing a paper, and I know I'm gonna kick myself tomorrow morning when it's still not done... but I'm just so anxious about tomorrow!  According to the Electoral Vote Predictor at Electoral-Vote.Com:
<img alt="""" src=""http://www.electoral-vote3.com/nov/nov01.png"">

Blue: Kerry.  Light Blue:  Weak Kerry.  Blue Outline:  Barely Kerry.  White:  Exactly tied.
You're a smart person, you can figure the rest out.

Well according to this map, which has Kerry ahead in OHIO, FLORIDA, and PENNSYLVANIA, three SUPER important states, Kerry's gonna win by like 70 electoral votes. Kerry 298, Bush 231, to be exact.  In fact, even if Bush got all the states that are tied AND Florida, Kerry would still be over 270.  

Oh geez i am so preoccupied.  Let's just get this thing over with so that I can focus on schoolwork again.  HAHAHA, that's a good one.

i LUV barack obama.  he's so adorable and fun and he's so smart... mainly when he's standing next to alan keyes.  i was watching the obama/ alan keyes debate earlier and i swear i laughed out loud no fewer than 10 times at the things keyes was saying, and to my knowledge he never deliberately made a joke.  he's got some ridiculous views, and the most hilarious part of it is that he's not lying or playing politics-- he really believes these things.  it's kind of sad, really.  i can't decide what cracks me up about him more-- the opinions he has or the fact that he looks like some sort of rare species of amphibian.  like a cross between a poisonous jungle frog and the gecko from the geico commercials.  it's uncanny.

moving on, i'm failing all my classes, you'll be happy to know.  my bank account is devastatingly overdrawn.  I HAVEN'T DECLARED MY MAJOR.  my life seems to be falling apart in every possible way right now.  it's getting hard to be optimistic... but then i think about the HOT lip gloss i bought on saturday (incidentally, the transaction that threw my account into the negative) and somehow... everything's OK.

in political news, bush is up five points in the cnn/usatoday/gallup poll going into the home stretch- the last 7 days of the campaign.  i, however, get my political information from the daily show, where jon stewart sticks pin in his voodoo version of bush between segments.  biased? Maybe.  awesome?  absolutely!

i'll leave you with my favorite question to alan keyes at tonight's debate:

Reporter:  Mr. Keyes... you have run for 2 different U.S. Senate positions and in two different presidential elections, without ever even coming close to winning.  Is there a point where this behavior ceases to be useful?

Keyes:  Der... uhhh... I like to lose?  (Not his real answer; I wasn't paying attention.)

so basically i'm a huge nerd.  a fact further proven by my interest in the following link:
<a href=""http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~golder/dialect/maps.php"" TARGET=""_blank"">Harvard Dialect Study</a>

it's like a study of the pronunciation and word choice variations of English words across the United States.  For example, it examines the percentages and locations of people who say ""water fountain"", ""drinking fountain"", or ""water bubbler"" (who says that?).  So it's actually extremely interesting, and I've already spent countless hours exploring the ins and outs of the study.  I'm kidding, just in case you really do think I'm that big of a loser.

President Bush said Tuesday that the Iraqis are refuting the pessimists and implied that things are improving in that country.

What would America look like if it were in Iraq's current situation? The population of the US is over 11 times that of Iraq, so a lot of statistics would have to be multiplied by that number. 

Thus, violence killed 300 Iraqis last week, the equivalent proportionately of 3,300 Americans. What if 3,300 Americans had died in car bombings, grenade and rocket attacks, machine gun spray, and aerial bombardment in the last week? That is a number greater than the deaths on September 11, and if America were Iraq, it would be an ongoing, weekly or monthly toll. 

And what if those deaths occurred all over the country, including in the capital of Washington, DC, but mainly above the Mason Dixon line, in Boston, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco?

What if the grounds of the White House and the government buildings near the Mall were constantly taking mortar fire? What if almost nobody in the State Department at Foggy Bottom, the White House, or the Pentagon dared venture out of their buildings, and considered it dangerous to go over to Crystal City or Alexandria?

What if all the reporters for all the major television and print media were trapped in five-star hotels in Washington, DC and New York, unable to move more than a few blocks safely, and dependent on stringers to know what was happening in Oklahoma City and St. Louis? What if the only time they ventured into the Midwest was if they could be embedded in Army or National Guard units?

There are estimated to be some 25,000 guerrillas in Iraq engaged in concerted acts of violence. What if there were private armies totalling 275,000 men, armed with machine guns, assault rifles (legal again!), rocket-propelled grenades, and mortar launchers, hiding out in dangerous urban areas of cities all over the country? What if they completely controlled Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Denver and Omaha, such that local police and Federal troops could not go into those cities?

What if, during the past year, the Secretary of State (Aqilah Hashemi), the President (Izzedine Salim), and the Attorney General (Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim) had all been assassinated?

What if all the cities in the US were wracked by a crime wave, with thousands of murders, kidnappings, burglaries, and carjackings in every major city every year?

What if the Air Force routinely (I mean daily or weekly) bombed Billings, Montana, Flint, Michigan, Watts in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Anacostia in Washington, DC, and other urban areas, attempting to target ""safe houses"" of ""criminal gangs"", but inevitably killing a lot of children and little old ladies?

What if, from time to time, the US Army besieged Virginia Beach, killing hundreds of armed members of the Christian Soldiers? What if entire platoons of the Christian Soldiers militia holed up in Arlington National Cemetery, and were bombarded by US Air Force warplanes daily, destroying thousands of graves and even pulverizing the Vietnam Memorial over on the Mall? What if the National Council of Churches had to call for a popular march of thousands of believers to converge on the National Cathedral to stop the US Army from demolishing it to get at a rogue band of the Timothy McVeigh Memorial Brigades?

What if there were virtually no commercial air traffic in the country? What if many roads were highly dangerous, especially Interstate 95 from Richmond to Washington, DC, and I-95 and I-91 up to Boston? If you got on I-95 anywhere along that over 500-mile stretch, you would risk being carjacked, kidnapped, or having your car sprayed with machine gun fire.

What if no one had electricity for much more than 10 hours a day, and often less? What if it went off at unpredictable times, causing factories to grind to a halt and air conditioning to fail in the middle of the summer in Houston and Miami? What if the Alaska pipeline were bombed and disabled at least monthly? What if unemployment hovered around 40%?

What if veterans of militia actions at Ruby Ridge and the Oklahoma City bombing were brought in to run the government on the theory that you need a tough guy in these times of crisis?

What if municipal elections were cancelled and cliques close to the new ""president"" quietly installed in the statehouses as ""governors?"" What if several of these governors (especially of Montana and Wyoming) were assassinated soon after taking office or resigned when their children were taken hostage by guerrillas?

What if the leader of the European Union maintained that the citizens of the United States are, under these conditions, refuting pessimism and that freedom and democracy are just around the corner?"

"event","ok im at school, which is why i haven't posted to this in a while.  but if it makes you feel better, a lot has been going on. i moved in and all that, and then went to sacramento for my dad's wedding-- WHAA??  that's right, i have a new stepfamily. the ceremony was great, but the trip there and back and transportation and all that was really REALLY annoying.  cancelled flights, hours of bumper to bumper traffic, stuff like that.  anyways, here i am. back at school and classes start tomorrow.  had a fun night last night at hydrate wit my buddies (y'all should come next time) and now i'm just chillin cuz I don't have class until 2 tomorrow, whatup!"

"event","i've got like 6 hours until i have to leave for the airport, and soo much left to pack.  the mere fact that i'm sitting at the computer typing is insane.  

i know you're all very excited to have me back in chicago, but calm down, all in good time.  this coming school year looks like it's gonna be a good one, and it better be, cuz it's my last one. 

anyways, i better get goin.. i can either pack some more stuff... or see what's on tv. i think i can catch the repeat of the Daily Show."

"event","first and foremost-- i did it.  i got my tattoo, so take THAT all you naysayers. well i mean it's not like i'm the tattoo ""type"", if there is such a thing, so i can understand your naysaying.  anyways, i got it, and it's DA ISH:

<img alt="""" src=""http://www.geocities.com/lambdapeach4/tattoo.JPG"">

it's not all red, that's just my sunburnt shoulder blade.  what UP lady on the moon!

and YES, it hurts, but maybe that's just because i'm a wimp... whatever, i got a tattoo-- how wimpy does that make me?  but mainly the pain was in little intervals, and it feels kind of like a burn, only probably worse, at times.

hehe, now i'm acting like some kind of expert.

other than that, i was in BG and we went out and stuff-- people are WAY better looking there!  the guys are all like super hot and they run around playing football all the time.  NU sucks.  Yo says they're all cuter cuz they're all dumber, but I disagree.  They can't ALL be dumber, but they were ALL CUTER. and, BGSU being a bigger school, there were so many MORE of them.  Come on, Northwestern guys, get it together.  Downside (because there always is one):  the girls are cuter too. but only slightly, and it may have just been the lighting.

anyways, i've got three days until i go to chicago.  what's really going on?  what happened to the summer? why am I up at 7am? whatev i'm soo glad to be getting back to evanston it's sick. to set up my room in KEMPER (did i mention that's where i'm living?), walk around campus, and be somewhere besides cleveland. i've been here so long the cleveland air is creating a filmy layer of clevelandness on my body, and we can't have that. 


i came across this really sweet emily dickinson poem today:

<I><FONT COLOR=""#333399"">08 - Not In Vain


If I can stop one heart from breaking,
I shall not live in vain;
If I can ease one life the aching,
Or cool one pain,
Or help one fainting robin
Unto his nest again,
I shall not live in vain.</FONT></I>

isn't that nice?  doesn't it make you want to go do some volunteering?  there's a bunch of dickinson poems at this site:  http://amblesideonline.homestead.com/EmilyDickinson.html.  I really like her poetry because I like poems that make you want to go take a walk in the woods or make you feel like you're in another place, seeing different things.


anyways, i got the smallville season 2 dvd, and more importantly, SMALLVILLE SEASON 4 STARTS SEPTEMBER 22.  dude, NOTHING could make me miss it.  NOTHING.  and in case u were wondering, there WILL be a smallville kick-off party and it WILL be in Kemper and you ARE invited.  feel free to bring snacks and stuff, and remember there's no talking when Tom is onscreen.

ta-ta for now"

 or at least something like that. it's gonna be cute, so don't try to talk me out of it.  well, you can, but it's not gonna work.  the only argument that might sway me is the pain thing.  i don't know how much of it i can take, as that aspect of my character hasn't been tested to the limit yet.  i guess it will on saturday, although i've heard mixed things, that it hurts, that it doesn't, that it tickles... i figure even if it does, it's only temporary, right?

either that or this is a BAD idea.  your thoughts?"

<B>them: </B>well i don't want it. i can't spend it anywhere else.
<B>me: </B>it's not like a chuck-E-cheese token... they HAVE to take it everywhere else.
<B>them: </B>well i still don't want this gold piece of crap. gimme paper.
<B>me: </B>suckit. i don't have paper singles.  unless you want silver change, get outta my gift shop.

<B>so work has sucked lately... and by lately i mean since my first day.

Also, i've seen more mullets than I care to count.  wow... it's like when hicks aren't racin their pickups, they go to six flags.

SHOVE IT!

just kidding.  i don't mind the DNC, it's just that i disliked the job so much that it's hard to have a good attitude.  but now it's OVER!! seriously it's like being paroled for good behavior.  

in other news, i'm going on a wild shopping binge recently, so don't play.  especially online shopping-- name an online store and chances are i've shopped at it.

"event","So i'm at work all the rest of this week.  yeah, at the DNC.  it's really not a fun job, except for I get to talk politics for like 10 hours a day.  If you consider that fun.  And I don't think I do.

Basically, I go up to someone's door, knock, and tell them I'm with the DNC and we're trying to beat Bush and elect Kerry this November.  And if they're Republican, I dodge the baseball bat and tell them to have a nice day.  If they're not, I proceed to tell them why they should give me money right then, preferably in the form of a $100 check made payable to the DNC.  This is something I really suck at.  It's amazing I've lasted this long at the job.  Like they tell us not to take ""no"" for an answer, but I don't think ""no"" is that bad.  As long as I don't have to stand there and try to convince them over the sound of their barking dogs that the DNC needs their Social Security check more than they do.  

But it's OK, Friday's my last day.  I'm thinkin I need like a week or two to chill/shop before I start getting ready for school.  It's really not that bad of a job, apart from the actual ""working"" part of it.  

in other news, the olympics are on.  and in addition to my eternal respect for male gymnasts, for being so hot, and being able to perform on those ring thingies:

i also have gained a newfound love for synchronized springboard.  I had never seen it before, but it's SO cool.

anyways, i took this online quiz and what do you know:

You are going to Marry orlando Bloom. He will
always treat you right and is very romantic. He
will do anything for you. He is very polite and
has deep brown eyes and is very good looking
(which is another plus!). He can make anything
cheesy look really hot(like sliding down stairs
on a shield shooting arrows or wearing pointy
ears for example). Congrats!!

<FONT COLOR=""#990000"">Well, it's been a relaxing, restful, and leisurely winter break.  Like, seriously... I've been sleeping more than i've been breathing, no joke.  I had to set my alarm today so that I would wake up by 1pm... so that I wouldn't miss the <I>Queer Eye </I>marathon.  If u missed it, shame on you.  But don't worry-- i taped it.

So after all this rest I'm still dreading getting back to work... I can feel the stress creeping back up on me, like with every passing day i'm getting closer and closer to THE FUTURE.  and i seriously don't have time; i might have to skip out on this whole future thing.

so NU lost to BG, get over it BGers.  I know it made your year, but we NUers have more important things to worry about than football. i mean being our fabulous selves is a full-time job!  especially when Chicago is once again the murder capital of the nation.  So i shouldn't be proud of that, right? naw just playin.  even tho it is kinda cool that people might think that i might just wig out and have to bust a cap.  ya never know.  beat that, BG.  i'm sure there are more freak accidental deaths by out-of-control tractors in BG than anything else.

but i mean this murder capital thing is crazy... i mean chicago has THREE TIMES the homicides per capita of New York.  aw, well.

so i'll be in Chicago in a couple days. lemme know if u wanna come to my smallville-athon next week. (that's right-- i got the season one DVD, and you're jealous.)

this time tomorrow i'll be chillin in C-TOWN, and you'll all be taking exams and stuff still... HAHAHA.  if u don't like it--- U KNOW WHAT TO DO.

OK well finals week is over for everybody who matters, so here's this quarter's FINALS WEEK QUOTEBOARD for all you hard-core studiers out there-- ya know, lighten the mood, etc.  there aren't many this quarter due to me being DONE on TUESDAY... and also not studying very much at all.  so here goes...

<FONT COLOR=""#0033CC"">Mez(while watching Smallville):  did they mention yet that he has ALL of Krypton living in his soul?
Yo:  yeah, how did he get THAT job?
Me:  I think it's cuz he's the only one that made it to earth.
Mez: it's cuz he's the hottest... duh.

Yolanda:  <I>Jackie,</I> my room STILL smells like onions!

Me(playing The Two Towers on XBOX):  <I>AAAWWWWWWW yeah!  </I>Elrond's Death Charge!! 
Yo: Can you NOT sound like a 12 year old boy?

Me:  Whatever, my room's the coolest.
Yolanda:  UM, if by ""coolest"" you mean ""dirtiest"".

Me(banging Jackie's brick-hard sausage on my tray at Breakfast for a Buck) : How could they even serve you this?
Ely: I know... they gave you Fisher Price sausage!

Jackie:  Man, when this is all over I'm <I>swimming in a tank</I> of Jose Cuervo. 

Me:  Look at her hair in those nasty braids.  If i <I>ever</I> wore my hair like that i would most definitely look like somebody's house Negro... And u know I would be in the house; my light ass ain't workin' in nobody's field.
Yo:  Like ""Naw, I'll get a sunburn!! Are u kidding me, <I>Massa</I>?""
Me:  Like, ""You don't want your <I>best slave </I>to get melanoma, do you?!  I think not.""

Jackie:  So yeah tomorrow night i have a date with Senor Cuervo, Mr. Daniels, and Mr. Smirnoff.
Me:  Umm... what's Smirnoff's first name?
Jackie:  I dunno... Vladimir?</FONT>

AAAAAANND i'm done.  Have a good break; call me if you want in on the HYPE Cleveland party i'm gonna be at for the next three weeks!! U KNOW!!!!"

If you haven't seen it, I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT.  it's like amazing in lots of different ways... it's funny, and sweet, and moving, and inspiring, and <I>beautiful</I>... I've seen it twice and I will not hesitate to see it again.  

So my TOP FIVE stands as follows:

1. <I>Love Actually</I>
2. <I>Moulin Rouge</I>
3. <I>Friday</I>
4. <I>A Walk To Remember</I>
5. <I>The Emperor's New Groove</I>

but back to <I>Love Actually</I>... seriously, it's that amazing... i'm sure you'll love it even if you're not a sappy emotional chick like me... but that definitely helps. OH and buy the soundtrack.  Lemme know if you wanna go, seriously... ok i'm done. 

so here i am in the middle of reading week... doing exactly what i should be doing in the middle of reading week... NOTHING, and the problem is, everyone else is <I>studying</I> and stuff.  what's really going on?  Anyways, they'll probably all get their acts together the second i have to start studying.  Which, since i feel like rubbing it in, won't be a lot since I have ONE final and ONE paper, and i'll be done on Tuesday afternoon.  Jealous much?  Good.  

I leave you with a quote from one of the cutest character's in the movie, talking about why he's going to America to find women...

Colin: You're just jealous, mate.  You perfectly well as I do that in any <I>one</I> American bar, there are more women who are more beautiful, and more likely to have sex with me... than the whole of the United Kingdom!

they're not ladybugs, they're...

a) biting asian war beetles
b) ""africanized"" ladybugs
c) south american love bugs
d) indonesian prickly pears
e) west nile beetles
f) scandinavian jungle boogies
g) west texas dive bombers

who knows anymore?  i just wish they would go away.  i'm starting to dislike the smell of Raid, oddly enough.  

plus... i'm a dummy and i missed smallville tonight... completely of my own accord.  like i FORGOT to watch it.  ??? when does that happen?  well, in my world, NEVER, but in this parallel universe where hybrid beetles fly up your nose, smallville is priority #2. 

p.s... look out for the smallville season one dvd-- coming to a plex room number 7303 near you!"

"event","so i guess i'm back into the swing of this ""school"" thing.  it wasn't that big of an adjustment, really since i only have class TWO DAYS A WEEK.  that's right... mondays, wednesdays, and fridays i get to sleep in.  AAALLLL the way in.  hehe.  you're so jealous.. whoa, so jealous!  

just watched ""the truth about cats and dogs"" with my girls... it's a great movie, especially for all us homely types out there, hehe... plus, guys with accents are hot.  that's probably the most widespread turn-on you can find in girls, i've found.

so LTA is working a concession stand at the football game saturday.  come by and chill wit us... buy a funnel cake or somethin.  please?

i'm listening to frank sinatra:

i've got a crush on you
sweetie pie
all the day and nighttime
hear me sigh
i never had the least notion
that i could fall with 
so much emotion...

story of my life, huh?  aight that's enough... i need sleep."

"event","happy bday jflo! u just wait till this weekend-- it's ON.  

so the third xbox controller has gone over quite swimmingly.  we're apparently a part of somewhat of a halo tourney in the near future.  hence, we need boys to play on our team.  cuz whether or not our feminine egos let us accept it-- boys are better at video games.  no matter what, no exceptions.  i wish it weren't true, but it's a fact.  so if u wanna be on the winningest halo team this side of campus, gimme a holla.

in other news, download ""move your feet"" by junior senior... or don't, cuz northwestern will KICK U OUT.

btw, are they trying to KILL US? putting a convenience store in the plex just as i change my meal plan to block C? this is ludicrous."

"event","so back to me hating my job.


i work as a cashier, but sometimes i feel more like a vending machine:

me: Hi!
customer: (silence.)
me: That'll be 4.25.
customer: (silence, hands me money)
me: Out of ten?
customer: (silence.)
me: 6.75 is your change. Have a good day!
customer: um, you only gave me 5.75.
me: That's a dollar coin.  
customer: (walks away, in silence.)

but i mean the reason i have a job outweighs the myriad of reasons my job SUCKS. I mean, at least this year i'm not THAT CHICK.  Last year I was THAT CHICK.  THAT CHICK doesn't have a job, even though all her friends do.  THAT CHICK whines about how bored she is, how much she misses school, how she's going to decorate her dorm room, etc.  THAT CHICK buys pillows with money she doesn't have and promises herself that she'll clean her room TOMORROW. THAT CHICK is going nowhere fast.  Are you THAT CHICK??

Well I'm not... but is it worth it?

Quotes of the Day:

""Ooh, look at the Speedy Gonzalez cup!  Look, honey!  He's got a straw sticking out of his sombrero!"" -Random chick, 7:15 p.m.

""Ooh, who's that? He's a cutie!"" -Random old lady looking at the Tom Welling on the cover of the Smallville Soundtrack sitting at my register.  Damn right, he is, lady."

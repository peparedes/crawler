"event","I ain't been on here in hella long, so ima let yaw in on how I been doin....

Well the last few days I been goin to cheerleading practice, man I ain't worked out in dumb long and it feels good to get back in shape.  But right now I'm hurting soooo much!I'm so sore!God!!!!But n e wayz...I been working on hella dances, doin hella practices and shit.I got a lot on my plate right now.  I been stressin out hella much cuz of school work and things like that.  I recently got into it wit my daddy.Everyday he irritate me more and more and every day I get more and more off my mind.I'm finally speakin my mind to him.  And I feel better and better everytime I do it.Ever since the last time I spoke my mind, we yelled and stuff, but now he ain't like he used to.He nicer, so whoever said don't speak back to your parents lied.Sometimes that's what you need to do because if you bottle everything up inside (like me) it will hurt even more.It's a lot of damage and you don't need to do that to yourself.Let it out, cry, do what eva it takes to make you feel better.I mean it too!!!!So skew...I recently have a 3.5 and that's GREAT!But I just took these tests and quizes up in Chemistry and Alg 2/Trig.  They weren't too good of grades.I'm stressin myself out on grades and shit cuz I wanna succeed.I need to get good grades for the rest of high school because I need to go to college right after.I need to get the fuck up outta here.I'm tryna go to Xavier in New Orleans, Southern in Louisiana somewhere, or Clark in Atlanta.Lol, I'm tryna get as far away as possible.I'm pretty sure I'm goin to Southern because my husband is going there but now he talkin bout he wanna go to Grambling (dunno how to spell that) And I fa damn sho ain't goin to no grambling.Anybody can get into that damn skew.It ain't shit.You could have a 1.sumthing and still get in.But n e wayz...Speakin of my husband, we ain't been doin so well.Phone calls been shorter, and boring.We don't be havin shit to talk about, and we both had an attitude last night.We both got off the phone mad.I hate getting off the phone mad with him, cuz everytime I do I have a bad dream.I had one last night.It wasn't just bad, it was weird too.We argued over nothing.I hate that shit.And now it's all awkward at skew, but im pretty sho by lunch we be kew.Cuz I love him and he love me!:)But yea so today is not a good day for me.I'm sore, mad, sad, hungry, gettin sick cuz of my brotha Shea.It's all bad fa me today.And I gotta go to fucking practice!Shit!But This practice will be paying off I'm pretty sho of it.We gon have some damn j-lo bodies and shit!Lol!Can't wait to start cheering.Whoooooo!"

I wanna spend time wit my husband outside of skew.I mean it's kew and all and lately it's been really good at skew or wateva, I think it's because of the sunny days we've been having, but man it still ain't like it is outside of skew.We don't hardly eva spend time wit eachotha if it ain't in skew.I mean it ain't botherin me but it do get a lil irritating sometime ya kno?Well we had made plans for this Thursday.

We was supposed to go to the movies afta skew.I was posed to go with him afta skew and we was gon watch movies until like 6pm cuz I gotta pick up my check that day.

I been knew that his friend bday was on Wednsday and they was supposed to be doin something for him on that day.But come to find out, they doin something on THURSDAY, and Derrick knew all about it.We made these plans like in the beginning of the week and if he knew that he had already had plans why would he make some wit me.I'm not mad that he spending time wit his friends cuz I want him to have fun but I'm mad that he didn't tell me and had me all excited about spending time wit him.He been knew that we had these plans and from what he told me he been told his friends that he was finna kick it wit dem on thursday.So why would he do that.I know he wanna spend time wit me too and he don't wanna hurt my feelings but he coulda told me soona and we coulda just rescheduled or something ya kno?I wouldn't be trippin.I'm just mad cuz my hopes was all up high and stuff.I was really looking forward to spending time wit him tho.I can tell he sorry cuz he tryna make up for it by inviting me wit him and his friends out to eat and stuff.But I wouldn't wanna do that because it's just gon be the boys and I don't wanna impose on that.I'm pretty sho we gon spend time wit eachotha some how on Thursday, so im startin to not be so irritated.But I don't feel like talkin to him right now cuz I'm still a little mad.

Well hopefully I get to spend some time with him on Thursday...Hopefully....

Right now I'm tryna start on my chemistry project that's due TOMORROW!!!I know ima get through it tho cuz it's real easy.Everyone at the game right now but I ain't wanna go cuz it's prolly gon be bootsy and even if I did wanna go I prolly couldn't anyway.

but yea ima tty tomorrah k bye!"

Well all I did today was go to school.I got to see my husband tho.I Love him.We both was kinda worried last night because we had such a great time over the break with eachother.I know Yaw prolly like ""if they had such a great time why were they worried?"" Well it's a lot of ppl always in our business at skew.They always got something to say.I don't know why and neither does he, but they do and that ruins stuff for me and him.We can neva just enjoy eachotha at skew without someone having to say something.But not today...Nope...It was a nice sunny day.No one said anything.We got to enjoy eachother's company without people buzzing in our ears.It was nice.I wish everyday was like today.We would be a lot better in school.

The vibe at skew usually be all off cuz of ppl.But wen we at home or at a friend's house it's nothin but love and I love that feeling.We both do.We both love the feeling we get wen we ain't in skew.It's like a whole different world.I can't really explain it but yeah.I love him to death!He's my baby, my husband, my ONE AND ONLY!!!FOR ALL DEM BITCHES OUT THERE THAT ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT ME AND MINE'S!STAY THE FUCK OUT!!!I GO WIT HIM AND HE GO WIT ME!WE DON'T GO WIT NONE OF YAW HOES OR NIGGAS FA DAT MATTA!

But yea...It was a kew little day..And right now I'm just sittin here watching Half and Half.Waitin on my baby to get home so we could talk.But ima tty tomorra k!

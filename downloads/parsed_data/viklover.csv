"event","I am going to start out this entry with a BIG thank you to Jeana and Sara for coming down here over the weekend!  I had a great time and look forward to more outings together.  Also I want to thank all of Jeans' friends for their love and support of her and I being together.  Your many years of friendship is immeasurable, and I hope you all know how much I love her and appreciate your support of her for so long.  We all go through hard times in life, and our friends, family, and our relationship with God are essential in how we progress in this life.
I want to also thank you for accepting me personally.  It is important to me that you and I can have a friendship as well.  You have all accepted me at face value, and I will not forget it!  I look forward to continuing to get to know each other. 

Well, the Vikes won again, albeit ugly!  But a win is a win, I am hoping they can go 8-8.  Tice and that entire coaching staff need to go!  Boy am I glad I don't have people saying that about me and my job!  Course then again maybe they do!!! haha.

I hope everyone is doing well, and I look forward to seeing you over the thanksgiving weekend!

Take care, and God Bless
Chad"

"event","Oh..where to start.  Its going to be another fun filled week with Duratech Industries.  Work always gets hectic this time of the year.  What am I talking about!  It is all the time.  Basically for those of you who don't know.  I am reassigned to travel NE. CO. and KS.  I have a dealer network set up from the old territory rep. that I have to decide what to do with.  I think for the most part the stores are fine.  But there a number of areas that have been neglected for quite some time.  My job in a nutshell is what I consider to be ""adult daycare"".  We are considered to be a ""short line"" of equipment.  Meaning we are anything except John Deere, Case New Holland, or Agco.  So we are normally grouped in with a tremendous amount of small companies fighting for a dealership salesman's time.  Thus, they don't have the time-or are too lazy-to understand all of the programs that we use each year.  So they call me.  There we have it, ""adult daycare"". 

Chad would you quit complaining.  Yah I know.

On a happy note!!  Jeana and Sara are coming down here the end of the week for a visit.  I am very happy to have them come.  Even though I am used to being alone on the road quite a bit of the time.  I can't ever get enough visitors.  And considering that Jeana is my girlfriend, I would say that I am very blessed.  

Well the Vikes won yesterday.  Amazingly they looked far more under control with Brad Johnson at the controls.  Hmmm, they are one game back in their division-crappy as it may be-maybe I shouldn't give up just yet.  Then again they were playing the cowardly lions.

Over the next couple of weeks I am going to start traveling Colorado.  It is my favorite state!  So I am really looking forward to it.  I am also looking forward to having company with me.  And no, thank God, its not my boss!!!

I hope that this is finding everyone well.  
God Bless You, and hey, I have heard Christmas music in a few stores recently, so HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
I better get ready to Santa this year.  I love you honey!
Take care, Vik"

"event","It's been some time since I last posted on LJ.  I am settling in in Nebraska.  And I have to admit that it is not as bad as I thought it would be.  Kearney is actually a pretty nice community.  They have everything you could expect from a 27,000 person town.  I am looking forward to becoming a part of the community here over the next year or so.  My future goal is to move to Colorado and work my territory from there.  The states I cover for work are NE. CO. and KS.  So I think living there will work out fine.  
I want to say how happy I am to have bean home again.  I am excited to hear more from her trip and see all of the 900 or so pictures that she took.  It is amazing to see the way that God is working in our lives, and I thank him for everything he has blessed us with.  I hope and pray that I can continue to be a blessing in your life!
On a completely different note. It looks like the Vikings are done for the year.  If it wasn't obvious before it is now with the loss of Culpepper.  He wasn't playing that well, but at least he had some ability.  They don't have a chance of resurrecting the season.  They would have to win at least 7 more games to have a chance of doing anything in the division.  Not gonna happen.
Well that's about everything.. 
I hope I am finding all of you well.
God Bless....
Vik
P.S. Thanks sunny for helping me with beans car while she was gone.  Your a great friend!"

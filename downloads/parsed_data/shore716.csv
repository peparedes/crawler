"event","The day you made


This is the day we come forward,
this is the day we are found.
The touch of your skin,
the taste of your breath.

I have been lost before,
but I have been found. 
When will you feel,
when will you taste.

Feeling your breath on me,
feeling your heart beating.
Those are the things, 
my heart is yearning for.

Just the touch,
just the smell
makes my heart
flutter and beat. 

The water is draining,
the air is escaping 
and the walls are
starting to crumble.

Stupid I am,
stupid I will be.
But the stupid i will become
is the stupid i will love.

My heart beats,
it fluitters for 
the caress of your
hand and your heart.

Will it stop?
Will it start?
Who knows when i will
start to love or stop to think.

The bird has landed,
it has came in the
name of love 
and in the name of hate.

Touch me and feel
the hurt that has been felt.
Without love life is
meaningless. So feel
the taste of the heart.

The warmth of the touch,
the feel of the heart.
It brings you in but
be careful or it will devour you.

So open the door,
and come in but 
trek lightly or
you may fall.


Holler bitches! this might not be good but it comes from the heart"

So yea i am up from now after working basically a double by working the overnight at K-Town. Yea in case you don't know i am a manager trainee at mcdonalds'. It's going very well. I have been listening to songs that make me think of my mom. I seriously do miss her and i know in time it gets easier. It's been a long time but so days it's harder to deal with. I miss her so much but lets move on to happier news. That is...... i dunno. Let me think and i'll get back to you. But yea i'm going back to daemen in the fall if i ever pay my deposit cause i am soooo broke right about now but i will definitely get it done. So yea adam and i are still together. I really do care about him and i do hope that we make it the distance because he's a really good guy even tho i put him through a lot of shit he just always comes back for more. I can't believe how much i care about him but only time will tell with that. So yea that's basically it.... i will write more later tomorrow or tonight but for now i gotta go catch up on sleep and my shows. MUAH!"

from the ashes i have soared.
Into the depths of my heart, 
you will find the light that is within.

The sun has become me,
the moon has been forgotten.
The light is ever present
in this little heart of mine.

My life has become 
an never ending cycle.
The change is coming,
the end is near.

I have been risen,
into the ashes nevermore.
I can see the light,

"event","As i write this i am sitting in clintons living room...writing this on his laptop onto my live journal which i am going to post into my diary tomorrow when i buy it. I am going to start this off by saying....i'm kinda excited that i'm going to start to write down my feelings and anything else i feel like writing everyday. I have a lot on my mind most of the time and i think it's a good idea to get some of it out so that i can stay sane. So here goes with my first entry....Well today was a really long day. It was a 2 show day. The first show was actually really good. I was in the dress circle on the right in the lobby. There were a couple of school groups that came in but that was alright. This one guy came up to me and asked if we gave out oxygen. It was really funny. So in between shows clinton and i went out to eat and we went ring shopping. We both got these rings from kmart...i put mine on my right ring finger and he put his on his left wedding finger...his is skin tight so i hope he has fun trying to get it off..... but i also stated that i wanted this titanium ring from this jeweler and he had till we went on vacation to get it. I really do love him...sometimes he drives me insane but i care about him a lot. He has a lot of flaws but he treats me better than anyone has ever treated me before and i love it. So this would bring us to the second show which i was in the balcony on the left. It was a lot of fun and there were this school group. After work i went back to clintons and watched 2 movies. The first was The Last King of Scotland. I heard this was a good movie so i rented it. I actually liked it...it had superb acting but that's about it. Then i watched this movie called Freedom Writers. It was amazing. I cried 2 times throughout the movie and got teared eyed a couple of times. This movie really touched my heart and as i write this i'm starting to get teared eyed all over again. I can't believe how good it was. It reminded me of when i was in high school and some of the hardships that i faced. Looking back on my childhood, it wasn't always easy with my family but we made it and i'm very proud of who i am today. So today i also started thinking more and more about buffalo. There are a couple of boys that i'm looking forward to hanging out with. Matt, Joey, Mikey and Adam in particular. I think it'll be a lot of fun. I have to remember to call Joe tomorrow and talk to him for a little since i am moving up there in a while. But yea i believe that's all that happened for today. I'm just getting more and more nervous and the date approaches when i leave. I hope that i'm making the right decision in doing this. Well god bless me and all of my brothers and sisters. Till tomorrow....

"event","So yea if you read all of this thanks and i seriously hope that you can get a little insight into my life and if you can relate to me let me know....so yea i am totally done with guys! When you start to think that you like someone something goes wrong with him to show you that you were wrong all over again. Once again life shows me that i don't think that i am supposed to be in love!!! I think that i am meant to wind up by myself forever. Besides having my best friends and friends there but i don't think that i will ever be able to love someone again! Maybe my morals are just too high or something because everytime i start to like someone i find something or they do something that gets me pissed off and shows me why i shouldn't be with them! Like the last guy....i totally liked him and he just kinda blew me off....so once again i am OVER IT!! I honestly think that i am not gonna look to talk to guys anymore....i'm gonna step back and make them come up to me....because when i approach someone i start to like them because i think that they are good for me to just get my little heart broken! If you know me you know that i fall for people really quickly and i believe that people are honest and they will tell me exactly how they feel but i guess not....i guess that's not how the world works. I just wanna know that there is a guy out there for me or something....Can a boy get a sign? I honestly can't stand guys right now and for the first time in my life i wish i wasn't gay...i wish that i was attracted to girls because who knows maybe they won't be like this! Maybe i am supposed to fall in love with one of my girl friends *hint hint* i know if i was to fall in love with one of them i know exactly which one i would want. I just can't stand to be alone anymore....i am tired of going to sleep and thinking when am i going to be in love again....not like i am rushing it because Jesus has his own plan and stuff but honestly i just want to be able to hold someone and know that they love me in a realtionship sense. So i think i have come to the conclusion that at the first sign of a problem....i am out of there like a bat out of hell...i will no longer sit around and wait for things to get worse! I am gonna try my hardest to not fall for people so quickly because like usual all the nice guys get there hearts trambled.  This is gonna sound so pathetic but are there any good, nice, cute guys out there that know how to treat someone with respect? If you know any of them....give them my number and tell them to call me because i would love to get to know them cause i always pick the wrong ones and i'm getting tired of it.  I'm honestly thinking about just not talking to guys anymore but then i might miss out on something amazing. I just have to make sure that before i start to put feelings into someone....they are willing to put their feelings back into me and that they are worth it! So yea this is probably the longest blog that i have wrote in a really long time so if you have gotten this far please please please leave me some comments so that i know what to do....love ya'll...

Forever and ever

While i sit here, i think of life
All the good things and the bad
Where have i been? 
What have i become? 
I know that i have found the one
the one that makes me content
I know that in this life 
there will be no other
So i just say babe 
your mine for life
There's no man that can replace you
there's no man that can have my heart
I'm yours as you are mine
and i just wanted to let you know 
that my heart belongs to you
I will love you

   Not like anyone ever reads this but hey it's worth me writing down my life hehe! Right now i'm sitting at home while my brother went out with his girlfriend to go have a drink at a bar....i hate not being 21 :-( Well today i went to Six Flags: Darien Lake for my brother's birthday! It was so much fun...we went on this new ride called the Tornado! I had so much fun! I finished Harry Potter today :-) I really liked the book but then again i liked all the books! I can honestly say that i like this book the most. CVS called me back today and told me that they are going to offer me the head cashier position! Yay :-) I'm so happy....i start on tuesday! I can not wait to start making money again...it really sucks that i don't have any money! Well as soon as i get money i'm going to get a cell phone number so if i know you then in about 2 weeks ask me for the number! I will hopefully have it by then and if your really important to me then i'm definitely going to call you as soon as i get it! But other than that i'm listening to a 70's CD :-) I really like it and i'm so happy that i made it! But right now i'm gonna go listen to it!

Today and not tomorrow

Walking down the street,
i pause and think where am i. 
Where am i going?
What did i do?
Mama always told me to look both ways,
but now i was laying there on the ground.
I didn't see the car,
where did it come from?
People are yelling to me,
i'm starting to hear voices.
Am i dying?
What's happening to me?
The voices are getting fainter,
does this mean that i'm going to see Jesus?
The light is getting brighter,
i can see my mother.
She says welcome home my son
This could have all been avoided,
if someone wouldn't have let him drive drunk 


Your life can be over just that fast so don't forget to tell someone that you love that you love them as much as you can and live for today not tomorrow because tomorrow is not promised!

 Well tonight was a good night overall. I went to club Marcellas which wasn't as much fun as i thought it was going to be but hey that happens sometimes! I saw mikal again :-) I can't believe how much i missed him and how much fun we had when we hung out! We talked about my birthday that is coming up and what we are going to do for it! We are supposed to be going to Toronto :-) That sounds like so much fun....i miss it so much and i actually can't wait to go now That was one of the highlights of my night which is kind of sad to say but hey w/e! No one at the club really hit on me but i did look really good or at least all of my friends told me so! Well after the club, we went to this diner :-) It was so much fun...a fight broke out there and i saw someone get stompped! It was so much fun...i can't believe that i didn't die laughing!  Well i met this boy there who's named will be saved for a later time! He was really cute but honestly right now all i want is friends so i don't think it will go much farther than that! But he really was cute and i got his phone number! I'm still deciding if i want to call him and see if he wants to hang out! It would be kind of pointless if he didn't drive! I was a little relucant to get his phone number because he is a little flameboyant but i decided against everything that i can think of that i was going to get his phone number! Maybe it was so that i could feel better about myself and that i was actually cute! Hey i remember when i was a server and people left me there numbers on my credit slip :-) Well anyway i'm kind of tired and my brother is going to be getting up soon! So anyway i think that i'm gonna go to bed now! I'll write in here later on today so until then......

I am so bored right now tho....i might go play softball later on tonight wit my brother! That could be the highlight of my day! On a more serious note, i feel so alone right now and i am so lost in life! I dont know where to turn but i know that Jesus will lead me in the right direction and he will continue to provide for me!

"event","I just got back from my first Pentecostal church.....the people there were so friendly :-) It was a 3 hour service....but it definitely didn't feel like that....I had so much fun there....i went there looking to see a show and the lord had a treat for me...the pastor came up to me at the end of his preaching and in the middle of church said that i shouldn't hold back praising the lord....which i was doing during some of the service because i wasnt raised to jump up and yell Hallejuah during a part that hit me....so he grabbed me and pulled me in the aisle and said son raise ur hands and then he said that your praise can work miracles....that was so invigaroting....i feel felt the holy spirit....but the best part of the service was when he was preaching to all of us....he said some things that hit Ernest, Matthew and I.....like he said that ""u all be messing around all the time....ur gonna mess around and fall in love""...which happened :-) I fell in love wit my baby Matthew :-) Also that....you should listen to what ur friends have to say and stop trying to be wise because what ur friends are telling u about could be god saying it himself....hallejuah :-) Also that you need to leave it behind....anything that is troubling you or anything that you should have left behind...you should now leave behind.....if you are reading this and you are troubled by something or your best friend told you something about a guy or girl and now you don't have ur best friend or that guy or girl anymore....you need to go back to ur best friend humbly and apologize and don't sleep until it is done....because to lose a best friend is really bad.....also always remember that the lord is with you in everything that you do and if you ever need him all you have to say is Jesus and he'll stand up for you right then and there....just don't use his name is vain because everytime that you say his name he is gonna stand up for you.....also i know that i have said it enough....but leave it behind and take a step forward....i learned a lot today in the service....God spoke really hard to me today and i definitely feel like a different person....God made all of us go to that church today and i'm very grateful that we went there....If your down or whatever....always remember that there are people that will not wake up today because the lord has decided to take them into his heavenly palace or damn them to hell....so always be grateful that the lord has considered you worthy to let you see another day and to breath....

It is not good to lie so if you are lieing you better stop lieing because when you want someone to believe what you are saying they aren't because they are gonna say to themselves....this person lies what should make me believe them now :-) Lieing will not get you anywhere so stop lieing if you have already started it. :-) I know for the rest of my life i am not gonna lie to anyone...and i will not longer so nasty things to people because nasty things can hurt people's feelings and i should always think about other people's feelings before i think about mine.....i need to stop being selfish and consider other people's feelings before i open my mouth out of anger or anything like that :-) This is my solemn vow and i pray to you Jesus that you give me the strength and you help me keep my vow....

If i have ever hurt you before....i am sorry and i promise that i'll do my best to make sure that i never ever hurt you again....that is my solemn vow and always remember no matter what anyone says....you are beautiful because God made you in his image and God is beautiful so ur beautiful....God Bless you all and if you took the time to read all of this on ur own then i give you a lot of credit and i pray that God will always help you out in every situation....remember that all u need to do to cure you out of a situation that you may be in is raise ur hands up and say Jesus i am yours and please help me through this situation and he'll be there to help you out......Lastly.....always remember that you can leave it behind and move on and be a better person cause that's what god says :-)...well that's all....but may god always be with us all and forgive us for our sins....

"event","Well let me first start off by saying that right now i am so darn bored....this is probably the most bored that i have ever been in a long time so i am gonna make a top 10 list of why i miss buffalo.....

10......The darn rabbits
9.......The good Daemen College food
8.......The snow
7.......My job at Mobil
6.......The classes :-) I know i'm a dork but if u really know me then you know it's true
5.......The dorm rooms :-) Havin my own room is cool
4.......Playin cards to all hours of the night for money
3.......The freedom that i don't usually have
2.......All of my friends at Daemen College
1.......Mara Rachel Cappas :-) I really miss her a lot and i can't wait to see you again and share in more memories with you that i will remember for the rest of my life.....

Well here's a poem that i wrote about my baby Matthew :-)

The way you make me feel by Dennis Matthew Hernandez

The way you make me feel 
can't be expressed in words.
How long i want to be with you
can't be expressed in numbers.
Every day my love grows 
more and more for you. 
I don't know what i would 
have done if i didn't meet u.
I love you baby and that's 
the way that i feel about u.

:-) I know it's really cheesy but hey i am not Shakespeare.....or something like that :-)

Well besides that i am havin fun in Georgia.....Matthew and Ernest have work tonight :-( So i am gonna be by myself tonight...:-( I am gonna be so bored...that's why i'm up right now so that i know that i can sleep later on tonight when they go to work because i don't feel like being awake and being bored all night while they are at work and then when they come home be even more bored because they went to bed from being tired....i hope that we all can go to Church tomorrow....we are supposed to go to the Penacastal church or something like that....i only know the church because it's the church that the folk be yelling amen and stuff in it :-) I can't wait to see some down south church that they yell in  :-) It's like i have been waiting my entire life for it to happen and now i can't wait for it to happen....well that's it for now cause i am gonna go watch Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets....which btw is my absolute favorite movie but until later....peace kiddo

Well let me start off wit the depressed mood....i am depressed bc i just look at the daemen college website and for my major i have to take a lot of classes :-( So i will not graduate for like another year or two :-( Well i am also in a good mood bc tonight Matthew said that i am the King of his Castle.. it might not mean that much to anyone else but that is probably one of the cutest things that he could have ever said to me! Well right now in am sitting in his parent's computer room writing this.....we came home for his mother's birthday.....his family treats me so good and i love it! He treats me great too so don't get me wrong....well that's it i guess for now except that i miss my lil boo boo kitty and Ernest....so until later...peace kiddo

It hit me so hard and confirmed my religious beliefs....i am so happy that i shared it with Matthew and Ernest.....we have got so close so quickly and i'm loving it.....right now i know that if i hadn't met them....Georgia wouldn't have been the same so if you guys are reading this....thank you for the fun times so far and i love forward to the good times that we have to come :-) I love you guys.....So yea if you read my last journal entry...you would know that i was so nervous about meeting his nana....but by the good grace of god...she liked me and so did his mother! His mother even hugged me :-).....i really like his nana....it reminds me so much of my nana.....she was so sweet and caring towards us and she didn't even really know me that well....she made lasagna...darn it so so good that i wanted to take the whole pan home with us but hey she gave us a frozen pan of that so it will have to do :-) So yea yesterday was so much fun  and i think that it made Matthew, Ernest and I so much closer because we all shared time with the lord :-) Well for right now that's it but i feel so accomplished right now and i can't wait to see what is gonna happen later on tonight.....peace

He works in mysterious ways sometimes so if something isn't going right or you don't get something that you wanted....it's for ur best interest that u didn't get it....God has a plan for each of us and while sometimes we don't know whats happening...believe me he is there for you and he loves you so don't ever get depressed.....remember that ok? My finger hurts :-( last night i dropped a pitcher of iced tea and it cut my ring and pinky fingers :-( I have a big cut on my fingers i thought i was gonna have to go to the emergency room cause i thought that it cut deep enough where i was gonna need stitches cause it wouldn't stop bleeding Well right now i am kinda blah because Mara told me last night that her bf (or w/e the heck u wanna call him) Prince said that he is gonna sleep over her room everynight and that will interfere with my college experience wit her because i don't want some guy tagging along with us wherever we go unless he has a car then he can come over sometimes and sometimes only :-) Mara is such a cute girl and she deserves the world so i really hope that he takes care of her....my baby matthew has to work tonight :-( I like spending time wit him when he isn't sleeping :-P He is always sleeping damn it......boi wake up! Well it doesn't matter how much he sleeps cause he is so cute when he sleeps that i can't help to just say that i love him :-) So.....Greg finally moved into a new place and i had to help him move yesterday! He is gonna have some type of tv program or something.....it's gonna be off the hook....plus he is gonna have cable modems...so not only will i have my own computer running i will also be able to watch tv while talking online :-) Well it's all good i suppose but it was so hard yesterday having to move Greg! Last night matthew had to work so i played tennis with Ernest then we played this game.....it's so much fun! I have so much fun with Ernest and Matthew.....honestly i am gonna miss them so much....just thinking about not being able to see them for like 3 months makes me depressed and makes we wanna cry so i am not gonna think about it....:-( Well that's it for now cause i wanna go play this game on PS2.....damn i'm turning into a Nerd

Matthew is so cute.....i just walked in the room and i jumped into bed with him and immediately he put his arm around me :-) I can't wait for his birthday cause he is gonna get a great birthday gift :-) If ya wanna know and you read this just ask me and i'll tell you about it!  But yea Matthew is so cute and i totally love being with him....waking up to him is the best feeling in the world because i wake up and the first thing that i see is the thing that i treasure a lot! Damn he makes me so happy....well i am gonna stop writing for right now because right now i feel like i am on top of the world and tomorrow i hope that the world isn't on top of me :-) I am gonna miss him so much when i leave....but for now let me go enjoy the time that we still have together....till later....peace kiddo"

Classes are going great....i think that i will get a 3.4 which would totally rock! Spring break is coming up next week :-)!!! I can't wait......right now i am sick tho! Yesterday was worse but i think it's starting to get better gradually! Well i wrote a poem for Lit and i feel like sharing it wit you.....so here goes.........

What God can make and what he can take

Strawberries are the sweetest thing that God ever made;
they have an outer layer that people see, 
and a sweet inside; they are red all over. 
When you put it in your mouth,
you are tasting God's true goodness.

When people looked at you, they saw
a strict rigid person. but once someone 
got to know you, they realized that although
you seem strict, you had a sweet inside;
you are one of God's true gift's.

God took the strawberry out of me,
when he took you from me; the sound of
your strawberry, the embrace that i felt,
the sound of your voice are the things
that my strawberry yearns to hear.

I count down the days till we will
meet again but in a better place. My 
strawberry has been broken in half. How 
will i go on without you? If you 
could see me now you would say keep your head up!

The fruit of my life;
I will always love you Mother!

If your reading my journal entry and don't know me then i'll explain that poem! My mother died on November 5th, 2002, exactly 6 days after my 18th birthday. She was 47 years old, every day i think about her and how much i miss her! Well i hope that you enjoyed the poem but for now i gtg....peace

"event","So a lot has happened in my life in the past couple of days!!! Well i'll start off at the beginning......i am prolly getting kicked out of greg's house which is going to suck but i'll deal wit it!!! I have a new b/f....his name is Reid but i call him nemo!!! There's not a lot that i can say about him except that he's a great guy and i like him!!! Well i got paid today.....yea that's always a good thing right?!?!?! Well then i am on my way out probably to adventureland wit Jeff so i have to stop writing now because i have to wake him up but i hope tomorrow that i can go to ligaly because i miss my people there lol!!! Well that's it for now except that just remember one thing; you can think that you have a great life and it can change in the matter of a second!!! One more thing; a best friend is someone who stands by you through thick and thin and that will stand up for you when no one believes you or when you do something wrong!!! Btw Greg i still don't respect you for what you did.....even tho i said it was ok.....inside it wasn't!!! You know exactly what you did to me and you will have to live wit that what you did drove me away a little!!! But that's it for now......peace kiddo

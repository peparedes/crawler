"event","as i walked into our house this evening, i noticed a strange lack of heat within the living room.

""perhaps the air-conditioner has been fixed?"" i thought.

i heard the sound of something running, but saw that it was only a fan.

alas, the coolness within the air was such a change that my curiousity got the better of me.  i fiddled a bit with the thermostat and heard something click inside the interior of the house.

::sighs::

no more sickness from sleeping with a fan 7 inches from my face.

::more sighs::

i heart the smell of air conditioners.  ::holds nostrils over vent::

today was the first soccar practice.  twas fun, although i already have slight tan lines due to my socks and shirt.

i must say, it was effing hot."

i have something to say.

when the lights go up late, early, or maybe even not at all, it is my fault.

when amy misses a spot cue because i forgot to tell her, it is my fault.

these are things that i fully comprehend.  these are things that i don't:

why it is always my headset that is heard in the house, even though barbie, who also has a headset and is SITTING IN THE HOUSE, is never possibly guilty of having hers too loud.

why when the lights go haywire, it is somehow my fault, never the fact that the theater itself is horribly broken down and would be better off burnt to a crisp.

why if something isn't my fault, it must be the friend i brought, (because we all know that i secretly bring people to sabatoge the show.)

why i am constantly informed of the noise the children make upstairs, (as if i could stop it.)

why i am slapped on the back for laughing at the kid who taped his script to the auctioneer stand.

why i am to be blamed for sara's microphone never working.

i am SICK of being told that i fucked it up.

i DIDN'T.  if i DID i would've taken the blame for it.
 
you know who you are.  if you want my job, take it.  it's not worth you just staring at me while i cry because you pushed me to my limits.

tommrow better be different.  for you, brett and kelsee, i will not quit.

"event","i hate my brother.

i'm so glad we're only half related.

actully, he didn't even do anything this time to spark this hatred.  i just don't want to be stuck with him this entire weekend without my mom as a shield between him and i.

ugh.  he is such an ass.  i hate him.  he thinks that everyone is at his command.  i have honestly never known anyone to snap their fingers at their friends when telling them do something, but he does.  i don't know why he has friends, but he does, because they NEVER STOP CALLING.  one called 14 times in two hours.  his little girlfriend, (or should i say girlfriend-S) has demanded to know where he was and what the number was to that place, but only after calling four times that hour.  

stupid 14 year old bitches.

i think i actully heard him masturbating while on the phone once.  i picked up the phone to call someone, not knowing he was on the line, and i heard seductive groaning.  i was a little agog, so i hung up quickly.  a couple seconds later he, ranting down the hallway, yelled at me and told me that he was on the phone.  

i hate him i hate him i hate him.

he cut my foot open once.  i tripped over his skateboard, became angry, and threw it onto the porch.  (he already would not get off the phone, even though he had been on it for 2 1/2 hours, so i was already mad at him.)  he saw what i did and then shoved me down the hallway, smacking me into my closed door, which opened.  i don't exactly know how my foot was cut open, but that was the process.


more complaining...

i need health.  

i feel as though my spleen ruptured, gangrene settled in, and my lungs have been coughed up out of my throat.  i have had three infected eyeballs in the past two weeks.  i don't have three eyes.  

but according to the doctor, nothing is wrong with me.  seven prescriptions, and nothing is wrong with me.

but i was reminded by the doctor of my fatness.  instead of telling me to, ""lay off cookie,"" or that i, ""have a spare tire,"" or by maing me do sit-ups because i apparently don't know how to do them, he said, ""no more cake.""

i will never go back to that stupid, insane asshole again.

i swear i have mono.  i've felt horrible ever since ""noises off.""

on a happier note...

i just returned from kelsee's open house.  

many many many pictures.

eric gray... i adore you.  espcially your eighth grade photo.  i cried with joy.  also, i spit up my lemonade when the imaged popped back into my mind.

i miss the theater."

is it bathing suit, or a swimming suit?  i just don't know.

they organize their store by body parts.

while i was roaming around yesterday, looking for contact solution, i noticed that there was a hair aisle, a tooth aisle, a face aisle, an eye aisle, a cuticle aisle, and, of course, a butt aisle.

the butt aisle was directly across from the eyeball aisle, where i found myself.

in german we have been watching the weirdest movie ever.  the characters do nothing but smoke pot and drug each other.  there is no story line at all.  the main guy even drives a car with a big pot leaf painted on it.  once when he was on crack he thought he was the moon.

something AMAZING happend in that class yesterday.  three of us were boucing a beach ball back and forth to each other, when suddenly it was hit way out of our circle.  out of nowhere some girl walks in and WHACKS the ball, sending it bouncing across all of the desk, off the chalkboard, off the food table and back into our circle without ever touching the ground.  after awhile the game started to get a little crazy, and i kept hitting the ball against the ceiling lights.  this is why i like my german teacher so much: when i hit the ceiling she said, ""HEY! BE CAREFUL! the ball is going to go flat and then we'll have nothing to play with..."""

everyone of those descriptions represents an event that has occured in my life since last thursday.

first off, thusday we played triwest.  we started off a little behind.  i played first the whole game and caught a line drive, a foul ball or two, and stole two bases in one run.  we ended up winning. 

then next day at school i got up a little late, but then got my report card and was pleasantly surprise. also, the varsity coach complimented me numerous times on my playing the previous night.

later that night, ryan came over and made me want to spit on him and his ::rants and cusses:: good for nothing body.

this morning i got up on time for work and even showered.  got paid cash and went to the game against covington.  i started the first three innings, and i don't think i made any errors, but nothing really exciting had happend.  

fourth inning comes around and i get replaced by someone.  i don't have any idea why, and i am throughly confused and slightly angered.  she gets in there, and misses a nearly perfect through.  falls right out of her mit.  they score two or three runs, and i am frustrated.  after that it all went down hill.

after the fouth inning the score went from being 0-1 to 0-9.  my coach said to me, ""she wanted to try it, so i let her, and it's not working at all.""  i felt better knowing that i hadn't done anything to sit on the bench.

so i'm driving home after being beaten by the 10 run rule, when something in the car snaps.  i'm nearly home and figure i can make it.  i hear something clinging and clanging, and discover that the engine is smoking and leaking fluids everywhere.  i was told that the antifreeze was probably gone and a belt had probably broken, and it could've blown up.

i want to hide from everything."

so we've had this ""discussion group"" in english for ""lord of the flies"".  

i have never had so much fun talking about a book.

o dustin.  how you humor me.

Piggy reminds me of Carl Weezer off of Jimmy Neutron.  

favorite lines include: ""sucks to your auntie!"" and ""i should be chief. i can sing a C sharp.""

i laughed the whole hour.  my cheeks ached.  

emily and i had a wonderful conversation of her sixth grade friday the 13th party.  i remember people were being really stupid and somebody looked up in the sky and said, ""look! the clouds are forming into a skull!""  our gullible selves looked up into the sky and i remember hearing kaleigh newton saying, ""::gasp::  it's a sign!""  shortly after the class smelly kid showed up and j.t. said, ""::bigger gasp:: IT IS A SIGN!"" and we all scattered in different directions.

o how i miss elementary school.  those were good times; the dog bacon, the boob tree, o and the super soakers. 

when i first came to that school in second grade i was the fat kid, who had a suspicious looking mark on her nose.  my peers concluded that is was a booger, and the reason that it never went away was because i never showered.

i did nothing, but earned money, which is a bonus to the usual nothingness that goes on with me during spring break.

today i worked, slept, and drove to the vanity to meet kelsee to see footloose.  i waited for 45 minutes, and then went to get a salad and wait some more.  when i came back, i saw her car, and heard the engine making sounds like it had just been running.  but there was no kelsee.  i tried the vanity's backstage door, but it was locked.  then one of those odd, dirty, and smelly people from the restaraunt tried to strike up a conversation with me from across the alley.  i was tremendously frightened and agog, so i ran away, wanting to insult him using my german language skills.

i wasn't exactly sure why kelsee wasn't there, so i came home and checked my phone for messages, which there were none.  afterwards, i got on good old LJ and saw that she had seen footloose last night.  then it occured to me that i never mentioned that i thought that we were to see footloose tonight, instead of yesterday.  so here i sit, feeling stupid, horrible, and incompetent.

"event","for those of you who have listened to my grandfather on the radio, (yes, the tall one) you will have noticed something different about the broadcast this morning.

he was not there.

the company IN KENTUCKY that controls the radio station is trying to attract a ""young, hip, male audience,"" and believes that getting rid of my grandpa will solve the problem.  hmm.

so today was the debut of the new station.  it is called, ""thunder,"" and they spent the morning talking about how telitubbies are gay.  

::Ryan finds this interesting.  Kali smacks Ryan across the face and tells him to shush. Ryan walks away crying. Destined to put on a new shirt swallowed in tears.::

but they have not shut out my grandpa completely.  they have granted him an AM station.  so all of his faithful listeners tuned in to his new station this morning, only to find nothing but static.  then those listeners called in to, ""thunder"" to complain.  i laughed heartily.

petitions are being formed.  protests are being planned.  a revolution is beginning! 

anyone else?"

days like this make me adore playing softball.  days that are bitter and leave my short-wearing legs make me want to stomp my feet.

today there was a conversation about chicken eggs.  somebody thought that they were the actual chicken fetus.  

here is a question that was brought up today.  pretend you are starving.  you haven't eaten in a month.  there are two doors in front of you, one with 5 hamburgers that all taste like poop, and one that reveals a single hamburger that is the most delicious thing ever.  which do you choose?

i said, ""i don't like hamburgers.""
another said, ""of course.  the scruptious one.""
my teacher said, ""the five.  i would be starving, and poop is not so bad.""

heh.

that man hates me.  i would hate me too.  i refused to take the drug survey, told him how stupid many of his assignments were, and chronically tell him that i want to play speedball.

it has been twelve days since i have updated.  what have i been doing, you ask?  well, nothing.  i am just lazy and this is the second time that i have been on the internet since the day we saw Grease.  there are a few new and interesting events that have happend, though. here i shall list some of them:

1. camren and aj both cut off all of their hair and i miss it so.
2. ryan got a job at arni's, where he cuts the pizza and brings it to the tables.  there is absolutely no pizza-baking whatsoever.  
3. bent my thumbnail back and now it remains a purple disgusting mess.
4. realized that my brother is trying to look like every character in the harry potter series.  first, he looked like harry himself, with the big glasses and shortish, longish, brown hair.  now i think he is trying to look like snape, because his hair has been dyed black, along with black painted fingernails, and the fact that he wears my dad's and his girlfriends pants.  i don't really know what that last one has to do with anything, but i thought that i'd mention it.
5. got new carpet.  have not actually put the carpet in, but it lays in a roll in our hallway.  it is quite a fun obsticle for myself to trip over as i head to bed.
6. said, ""fwee"" instead of, ""free.""
7. remember and laughed of with family at Easter.
8. finally figured out the words to a hairspray song that i have been listening to for months.
9. read two books in four days. 
10. wondered why i did the above and why i don't have anything better to do and sit at home everynight and read.
11. typed a run-on. (see above)
12. receieved ""anchorman.""

so i will.

i think my body knows that spring is near. i wake up with daylight outside. today was especially warm, and i got to spend nearly the entire afternoon playing softball. i think the weather helps relax me, because i caught an AMAZING catch right down the line. i like first base so far. new position. it might just be a good change. i'll probably end up catching again, but that's ok. something different for awhile.

anyways...

still have not found pants. more things to add to the list are a strapless bra and a hat.

saw hairspray. good, good show, although i had been listening to the soundtrack for weeks before seeing the show, and was mildly disappointed with some of the voices.

softball will be the death of me. i am getting sick from exhaustion. the combination of softball, the vanity, work, and larceny and old lace is slowly deteriorating my mind. 

::is unconscious::

i am glad to be back at the theater. with all of the farting, light-up jackets, and stories of drunken cast parties. 

i did SEVEN effing loads of laundry today. there was and is no time last week or this week.

i really think all of this lack of sleep is getting to me. i randomly fall asleep all the time. also, i think i am sleepwalking again. tis' scary. i've walked down the street before while sleeping only stopping because my mother was chasing after me. the odd thing is, our door was chain locked and bolted when i did that. i also keep turning my alarm off while sleeping, and that's across the room for that specific purpose. i did that four time this week.

i must continue laudrying away. perhaps my next update will be more interesting, and sooner than a week from now. goodnight all."

there really is nothing interesting to say.

last week was finals. i think i did ok. i know i passed all my hardest test. so that's good.

new trimester started monday. first two classes are horrbily boring. somehow i got sucked into astrology. when planning my schedule, i said ""athletic trainer."" so i got stuck in a lot of science classes that i will never ever need. but i am changing them all. so psh.

softball officially starts next week. wOOt wOOt. but the school play also starts, so i fear i shall be swamped.

i slept for a long time today. and for those of you who care my poop was an odd gray today. i saw a nickel on the floor and realized that it matched.

::sighs::

ryan gave me a squirrel that he made for a class about a week ago. he sewed it himself. it is so repulsive. i adore it. it's like a wounded animal. its guts are hanging out but it is still the cutest thing ever. all of the appendages are completely unproportional, and he drew a face on it with marker. when emily saw it she literally laughed for five mintues straight. 

my breath taste bad.

this is a very dry and boring entry, but i really have nothing better to do right now.

saw keltheh, leeann, and brett at applebees. i thought it was humerous how we were holding our hands up to block our faces while discussing who was to through the sugar packet only to look over and realize that they were doing the same.

went to the movies. afterwards, we ventured to walmart to play hide-and-seek. but we never found anyone. it was said that it must of been the best game ever. so we just left.

i just looked up at our calendar. it is no longer february, beeshes. ::flips paper::

i am seriously going to stop all of this rambling nonsense and go watch tv.

friday was entertaining. the day started with tiffany and i yelling at an old man. well, sort of. we yelled while the ""hairspray"" soundtrack was blaring out of the windows, so i don't think he heard us. that, or he was deaf. 

then ryan and i went to the china buffet, where i had another moment. ryan was explaining his theory that every person working at the china buffet was really just undercover. i raised my eyebrows and he hung his head in shame. but then he snapped back up and looked at me in all seriousness, saying, ""take out the H, N, and A in china."" i gasped, but then said, ""nuh uh. you'd have to take out another A."" ""Chinaa?"" ""o. nevermind.""  

emily, tiffany, ryan, joel, tim, and myself went bowling later that night. needless to say, my high score was 58. ::hangs head:: i really, really try to bowl well. it is just impossible. IMPOSSIBLE.

the next day ryan and i decided we were going to be spontaneous. so we saw the ""late"" showing of ""hitch"". (it was at 9:30, but usually he has to be home at 8:00. i was agog, simply agog.) on our way in we ran into wade and brett. we were greeted by wade saying, ""KALI! are you going to see POOH?!"" o how i've miss them both. well, anyways, ""hitch"" was long, boring, and drawn out. it was over around 11:40. and snowing. i wore flip flops. it was cold.

"event","i need to run. 

not anywhere in particular. i just want to run. i want it to be 62 degrees, sunny, and i want to grabbed my cleats, be bald, and run until i can't feel my legs. and most of all, i want to be alone for awhile. i want to run across an endless field until my heart almost burst like that dogs did in that book i read in 5th or 6th grade. i don't want to see or hear or smell any trace of people. animals are ok, as long as they are not bears. i would prefer my dead dog winstin, running with me, but he is, of course, dead. i don't want to just go for a afternoon jog. i want to sprint as fast as i can go for as long as i want to. i want to shed every stress behind me as i run. then when my body can physically run no longer, i want to collapse in the grass and let all of my sweat drip off onto the ground. then i want to somehow step out of my body, with just my soul, and look around. i want to take a step back and look at everything that is going on around me. a timeout, perhaps. a timeout from step-parents, enchiladas from little mexico, cat genital systems, skin, and crazy people. then i want to stare at something brighter than the sun. bright enough that it burns my retinas. and then i want to go back to myself, get up, and find some way to swim all the way back home.

this particular entry reminds me of seabiscuit. hmm. it all made almost no sense, but just an alternative to studying for a test. i think my mind has been asleep since last wednesday. and i think it woke up today in math class. because then i realized i had no idea what was going on, nor did i care in the slightest bit. i want a peanut. 

also, i think i am slowly becoming a vegetarian. sunday i had chester fried chicken, and while eating it i found either a poopchute or row of black teeth. then today i tried to eat chicken, and gagged the whole way through. then my mother made steak. it was good, but i had no desire to eat it. i only ate about half, and that was to make her feel appreciated. i think i could be a vegetarian. i went for almost three months without meat. i think another thing that has led me to this was the salmon i ate. i nearly died because of one of the miniscule ribs still inside. it was caught in my throat, and i threw up to get it out. except maybe i couldn't be a vegetarian because i don't like vegetables. except lettuce. i used to like green beans a lot, but then i found the stem in my dish at lunch one day. and there was the whole tooth incident with the BBQ ribs. (i forgot how to spell BBQ. hence the initials.) 

i finish ""the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime"". it was weird, to say the least, but i liked it.

today was one of those days that i completely secluded myself from everyone. i didn't do hardly any class work, i just sat down and read. that could possibly be why i've posted so much today. i know i've probably said this before, but this is the most random thing i have ever written. and it only took me maybe 15 minutes. hmm. i shall go study cat ovaries. ta."

I guess we WON'T do anything."" and then proceeded to tell me of his plans that he wanted to happen that day. after his speech, i felt awful and decided that maybe we could go to Dairy Queen or whatnot. so in by the end of the conversation, we had decided to do something, but we didn't know what. on Friday i asked, ""So, what are we doing Monday? I need to know whether or not i should skip practice."" he said, ""I don't know. What do you want to do?"" and the conversation ended. Saturday, same question, same response. Sunday same question, but the response was, "" I might have to work tommrow."" this morning i got a text message saying that he had to work. on my way home from school i got another message saying to come visit him at work. while still on my way home, i got yet <EM>another </EM>saying that he didn't have to work, so we could do something. when i got home i called and he said, ""I can't do anything because we're going to go look at cars.

in all my years of softball, i have never ever ever been able to hit a ball whilst in the batting cage. sometimes the ball would hit the bat, but then just sort of fall off. o, but the other day, i was hitting the balls left and right. i actually danced with glee. i even hit the ball OVER the cage, which isn't particualry good because it would be easy to catch, but still, it had distance. then i managed to catch without gear and without destroying my body. at a game last year i was warming the pitcher up without any gear on. my natural reaction was to stop the ball with my knees. that would have been a good idea if there had been shins guards between myself and the ball that was being propelled at aproximately 48 miles per hour. anyhoo, my knees turned black, and i couldn't move for a good hour. good times. i should just stop typing now because this is starting to look like one of dickie's entries."

(us as in myself, ryan, sheetz, furr, megan, and evan.) there we ate a lot of tacos, and told sheetz that he could us the quotes on the hot sauce packets as conversation starters for sami. one said something like, ""by looking at your palm, i can foresee much pleasure in your future."" o, i laughed. then furr showed us that he was wearing his ""workin'"" boots, rather than his ""goin' to town"" boots. then ryan and evan began stomping on his boots, not realizing that they had a steel toe. we rushed back to the school because evan and megan forgot their coats. ryan and sheetz found an old sweatshirt in the back of the blazer, which read, ""World's Best Aunt"". ryan wore it for a couple seconds, but it smelled bad. 

afterwards, ryan, sheetz, bennie, furr, and i went to crazy d's. ryan, sheetz, i got there first. as we were entering the truck stop, i saw the big cartoon of a cowboy on the side of the building. i pointed, laughed, and then sheetz remarked, ""that must be Crazy D himself."" we shopped for possible clothing options for sheetz and his date with sam. (sam's dad has to meet any boy that she goes somewhere with.) we found hats that said, ""mommy's little helper,"" and something about diapers and poop. they bought doughnuts, and i purchased a starbucks coffee thing. (later, after i had drunk over half, i looked at the expiration date and realized that it should have been thrown away January 10th.) we sat down at a table and talked about sheetz's shirt that he was designing. it will be about the top ten things women have said to him, such as:

1. ""adam who?""
2. ""you mean the pony guy?"" (he rode the pony at the movie theater. what made it so cool was that a small child and his dad were waiting in line for him to get off, but he still kept going.)
3. ""i can't believe i'm this desparate.""
4. ::disgusted face::

everyone had to be home by eleven, so we headed out to the cars. they decided to do a lap around the building before leaving. while they pranced, i thought that i would scare them by parking on the complete other side of the building. but as i was heading toward the other end, ryan and sheetz saw me leaving. i can only imagine what all of the truckers eating their biscuits and gravy saw: a vehicle speeding by with a girl saying, ""cheers"" to the customers with a cup of coffee, and then two guys sprinting with all their might after it. then the vehicle stopped at the stop sign and the two guys clambor inside. 

wow. it was fun."

"event","this has been one of the weirdest weeks ever.

on wednesday, sambrose and i went to the boys and girls club to watch basketball like we usually do. except the next day was her birthday, so we went to applebees with ryan. (she had never been there.) now ryan has a certain friend (sheetz) who, well, isn't exactly a ""girl-magnet"", for lack of a better term. he has tried to set him up with who knows how many of my friends, but they are all offended when i tell them who it is. the following is the conversation that took place at applebees:

RYAN: Hey Sam. Are you seeing anybody?
KALI: ::begins to shake head desperately::
SAM: ::sees Kali and is spectical:: Uhm, no. (?)
RYAN: Are you interested?
KALI: ::shakes head even more desparetely and waves hands in a ""no"" motion::
SAM: Uhm. ::glances at Kali:: It depends.
RYAN: Sheetz.
SAM: ::drops fork, gasps in horror, and nearly falls out of her chair:: What? Am I the last resort?
KALI: ::dies with laughter:: See, Ryan? I told you they all get offended! 
so ryan and i began telling sam about how funny and nice he was, like how he joined the swim team in 7th grade to LEARN how to swim. we also told her about the conversation he had at ryan's birthday party. it was about how he wondered if you could fart out your mouth. he concluded that you could (and also shart out your mouth), and hence, was the reason he had never been even close to having a girlfriend. he told us that he vowed to himself never to tell us when he went on a date until there was a second one, because every first date he would go on he'd shart out his mouth and that was the end of it.

but anyways, we finally convinced sam to give it a try.

later on, after we took sam home, ryan turned to me and said, ""What if Sheetz says no? O no. That would be the ultimate diss.""

yesterday the vocational teachers came to school to tell us about the programs. apparently they are starting a health vocational, where you actually get to work in St. Clare. that would be so awesome. they even give you lab coats. sweet.

i'm really just rambling on about nothing in particular. my mom fired some chick at work so i get to work every saturday and sunday. north/south game tonight. huzzah."

"event","{01} Reply with your name and I will write something about you.
{02} I will then tell you what song/BAND reminds me of you.
{03} Next, I will tell you who you remind me of, celebrity/animated or otherwise.
{04} Last, I will try to name a single word that best describes you.


meh. i'm home sick again.

yesterday i sneezed.

ok, that's not the entire story.

when i sneezed, i was standing in a doorway. i turned my head to avoid admitting thousands of germs into surrounding classmates atmophere's. but when i did this, i banged my head again the door frame. 

i sneezed another time in math class. it was nasty, and landed all over my shirt.

i sneezed another time in german, and got my sentences confused.

i sneezed in zoology, while we were skinning the cats.

buh."

"event","so here's how last night went.

i left around 10:45 for tammy's house. (she lives outside of greencastle.) my dad gave me directions by the use of landmarks. but of course, the landmarks were all covered in snow. also, there was no signal on the cell phone, so i could not call him. so i drove around until midnight, said screw it, and headed back home.

i was on the highway, getting ready to turn onto the road that goes by the gas station in darlington. there was another car turning off of the road that i was turning onto. she had plenty of time to turn out before i came, but when she did she hit nothing but ice and slid right into my path. she hit the front right end of my car, my airbag flew out, (which, by the way, was pointless, because it barely even touched me. all it did was burst a massive cloud of dust into my face.) and there were pieces of both cars strewn across the road. darlington is also a dead-zone, so walked about the highway looking for a signal. i finally found one, called my mom, and texted ryan. after that i never could get the signal back. the police and tow trucks came, and i saw that i had a voicemail, but still couldn't get enough of a signal to check it. my mom drove my to my dad's house to get my stuff, and went headed home. as we were on our way out of darlington, i checked the voicemail, which was from ryan. i called him back, but the idiot turned his phone on silent. i got home, and fell asleep.

which brings me to now.

i did have fun at the vanity last night. leeann, britta, ryan, and i discoved new uses for the lobby's trashcans. there was some pre-audition soccar in the parking lot, snow angels, and constipated faces. ::sighs:: stupid age limit. i started reading 'the red badge of courage'. it's ok, but i have to say outloud everything the characters say due to the heavy accents."

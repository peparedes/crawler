"event","so..i get a phone call from my mom who is missing and says shes in Penn. Why I ask? Cuz my uncle is dying wiht brain cancer. So after i pick myself up off the floor. She explains hown i have to go there and say my goodbyes. Saying he has about 3 years to live, and thats if he makes it through the surgery. So I go there to say goodbye to my 24 year old uncle. And thats where I have been the past couple of days. BUt good news!hes not dead. and he made it. and its cancer but not too bad of cancer.Its treatable.they say 3-5 years i think he can go longer. im just trying to be happy here.

im sad. I'm lonely. and my uncle just told me some stuff i realized. alot of things i messed up. Alot of things i wish i could fix. And i go through this about once a year. But its so different this time. like..my life..had explanations to it.finally.all those bumps in the road really did change everything.and that its okay to make mistakes.the only thing that sucks is i made alot of big ones.or maybe just one reallll big one.and i wish i could fix it.
I <3 my uncle eric...forever

How you could ever hurt me so
I need to know, what I've done wrong
And how long it's been going on
Was it that I never paid enough attention?
Or did I not give enough affection?
Not only will your answers keep me sane
But I'll know never to make the same mistake again

You can tell me to my face,
Or even on the phone,
You can write it in a letter,
Either way, I have to know
Did I never treat you right?
Did I always start the fight?
Either way I'm going out of my mind
All the answers to my questions, I have to find

I'm just waiting
Cos' I heard that this feelin wont last that long

Never ever have I ever felt so low
When you gonna take me out of this black hole
Never ever have I ever felt so sad
The way I'm feelin yeah, you got me feelin really bad
Never ever have I had to find
I've had to dig away to find my own peace of mind
I've never ever had my conscious to fight
The way I'm feelin' yeah, it just dont feel right"

I have to pray to get into these radiology schools,pass my road test,pass chem regents,focus on keeping my job 4 days a week, prom and EVERYTHIGN else. I feel so hectic right now and all your doing is making it worse.  All you can think about is yourself. You probably have no idea what's even goign on in my life cuz you don't remember anything I say. And why is that?CUZ YOU DONT HEAR ANYTHING I SAY. You have no idea how good you have it right now. Not a clue in the world. You life is based on just you. I've done some fucked up shit in the past but thats the whole point of growing up. You figure shit out.  I can't take the way you talk to me anymore and how you see life. I can't understand why you're so angry at everything esspecially me. I won't ever get the fact of how you can be with someone for long and still not have a clue of what love is. Cuz if you did you wouldn't wanna toss it aside everyday like it was a penny. I'm a person not an item and I deserve the same treatment that you give yourself. I deseve to go to movies and dinners ALONE and I deserve to have picnics and have doors opened and coats handed to me. Thats whats makes me the girlfriend and your the boyfriend. This is one of your 3 responsibities in life right now and you can't seem to do it. HOw hard is it to see the goodness in people?Why always the bad? I dont understand you and perhaps I never will but why let that happen? Why won't you stop doing this to anyone close to you. Is cuz you hurt therefore I should?But why do you hurt?Why cant I ever do a good job in helping?Why don't you understand me?WHY DON'T I GET IT!?how can you say you love me and then call me all these things.Why do you like being unhappy? You can never accept blame for anything that you do. You can only bring shit up from the past to try and make me look like the bad guy. I see right through you but I haven't done anything wrong to you in a long time. And you have done some pretty hefty things too. It's time to either forgive and forget..or forget me. Cuz I can't live like this anymore. I need to focus on my future.I want you there but with a smile on your face waiting for me,a girl you love. Not me the girl you vent on.I'm me take it or leave it..if you wanna take it,prove it."

Now here's the confuzzled part. I dunno, I just..ugh..Have you ever just felt like you're putting everythinggggg in and it just never seems to get better. Even flat out saying to the other person it takes 2 and I love you but I need some love back from you, and it just never happens? Whats with that? I'm just so confused on what to do right now. How to fix things. everyday its something new,something that is said to make me feel more empty.Or something not said to make me feel more empty. I dunno whether to be angry upset, dissipointed, scared...all of em?I just dont know what to feel or say anymore.Maybe I'm just crazy..

Ummmm Suppose to be staying at bills for a night over vacation,gotta work out those plans heh.I'm glad play is over,kinda broke my heart at the end.Daryll and I are doing better. I just wish he gave out a little more affection then he does. I feel like I put everything in and he just sits there and goes about his own life. I can only do so much. Anyways..sat. april and I and some wierd crew went to applebees for a bite to eat around 1am. Kinda went a lil wrong,do to some people being there that made it difficult to have fun. On top of being destroyed dealing with alot of crap lol.hmm what else?I start my new job today I believe unless this snow keeps up.Then tomorrow. I'm kinda excited to be working with my friends and stuff. Makes things easier to adapt to,I guess.

And when I woke up it was almost 1:15. But it was sunny and I was in little clothes. IT WAS SUMMER to me.God I miss the summer.I havent been sleeping well(what else is new) and it felt nice to sleep.No one was here or anything. It was such a great feeling.

Today...I dunno what the deal is yet.All I know is I'm not happy about going to school tomorrow. I can't wait till the break in April. I asked my parents about that whole thing Bill(if you read this) It's cool..I'll stay for however long.

Well me and abrilla have been doing alot of fun things ;) everday this week. I cant wait for her to get home from detention.  The talent show last week was pretty good.I got to spend time with a few people I normally don't that was a bonus.  School is okay I guess. I'm kinda getting in the slacking mode.  But for me slacking is like 85's. I'm just tired of everything.

I missed rehearsal yesterday due to sickness and term paper issues and then I went out from 10-12 to see Daryll. Which was quite possibly the best idea I've ever had...or he had. Either or.

Pepe abrilla dn I are doing""Danny and the dinosuar"" for spanish =) I love that book.Abrilla and I had a good sandwich yesterday and some popcorn mom made us.  My cat loves to attack printers.Random....

Tomorrow is drivers ed again and then friday too since we had a snow day.  Kinda bull shit if you ask me...

All in all I'm doing pretty awesome.  Daryll and I are wroking things out pretty smoothly and I love him. Arpil and I are now offically married.  Look at our ring fingers =) we're branded lol..today her and I are gunna make it another girls nnight/day and just chill and ameba as usual lol...

Okay Madonia I will update later on when I ahve more news...I AM NOW NAPPING MY HEAD OFF"

Wondering how in the hell we let it get this far and how you couldn't care. It's been so long since we've even enchanged words.I'm not asking for a ton of things from you.  I'm asking you to just pop in and say 'hi'.  It's this part of the year that is making it rough none the less. And there's so much I could say to you and put in here. But it's so pointless if it's not to your face. I bet you have an idea that I'm talking to you now. But you couldn't careless.  This isn't me attacking you saying you're a bad person. But I'm waiting and that's all I can do with out reassurance. I will wait forever just to fix this.If thats what it takes. But why wait that long?Hasn't it been long enough? I don't think I've ever believed in a saying more than ""You dont know what you have till its gone"". It's true.WTF was I thinking!?!?!??!?!?!! I swear I could kill me sometimes. I sat here thinking of all those things we did. And boy I could name thousands. I remember not wanting this to happen and I did what I could to stop it,and now it's so far gone. Why?!That's all I wanna know. Tell me you honestly that you dont want to see me, catch a movie ,catch up,period. And that would be my reassurance to let it go,but tell me that you do?...I would gladly listen.I'm waiting...with the smallest piece of hope and faith, or whats left of it. I just pray you know what I'm feeling."

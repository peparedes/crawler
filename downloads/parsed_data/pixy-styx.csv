"event","George W. Bush: The case for impeachment
By: Robert Zaller
Issue date: 1/20/06 Section: Ed-Op

I thought Bill Clinton was the worst president I'd seen in office
until George W. Bush came along. I was appalled when Clinton muffed
the best opportunity in sixty years to reform our health care system
by handing the job to his wife and even more amazed at the stupidity
of providing himself no political distance from the inevitable
debacle. I was disgusted with his betrayal of the working and
nonworking poor by the passage of NAFTA and so-called welfare reform
and at his extension of the death penalty and his weakening of habeas
corpus rights for the condemned. I thought his bombing campaign
against Serbia was a war crime. I believed he deserved impeachment,
not for his sexual behavior, but for abusing the trust of his office
in lying about it for eight months. In retrospect, it would have been
an immense boon for the country had he been removed by the Senate.
Then Al Gore would have become president with two years to establish a
record of his own, and we might well have been spared the nightmare of
the present administration.

If Clinton deserved impeaching, Bush needs it. He has created the
greatest constitutional crisis in two hundred years, and the future of
the republic, degraded as it has already been by the runaway
presidencies of his predecessors, may well be in the balance. I don't
suggest impeachment lightly, and I don't suggest it on the basis of my
disagreement with many, though not all, of Bush's policies. If the
American people want to vote for bad air, polluted rivers, destruction
of the biosphere and global warming, that is their democratic right.
If they want corporate lobbyists to write their energy, health and
safety laws, ditto. The remedy for policies you don't agree with is
the next election, laying to one side the high probability that Bush
was not elected but appointed president in the first place.

Why, then, does Bush require impeachment? I offer the following four
articles for the consideration of the Congress:

(1) He has recklessly endangered the armed forces of the United States
and violated international laws, treaties and conventions to which the
United States is a signatory. We now know as fact what common sense
told us three years ago, that Saddam Hussein, already denied effective
control of two-thirds of his country by aerial surveillance and
bombing, was no menace to the United States or any other nation and
that no military intervention was necessary to contain him. Bush and
his cohorts drummed up the fiction of a bristling arsenal of WMDs to
justify an attack planned from the earliest days of his
administration. It is very likely that Bush knew full well that he was
selling a lie. In an account never challenged by the administration,
he is described in Bob Woodward's Plan of Attack as expressing
skepticism when briefed by former CIA Director George Tenet in Dec.
2002 on Saddam's reputed arsenal. Bush is quoted as responding to
Tenet with an ""Is that all you've got?"" at a time when he and his
advisors were assuring the country that the arsenal, including an
advanced nuclear program, was fully documented. The episode was an
obviously Nixonian moment, on par with Nixon saying that ""it would be
wrong"" to buy the silence of the Watergate burglars for the benefit of
his secret taping system. When Tenet replied that it would be ""a slam
dunk"" to deliver all the evidence Bush needed, he was setting himself
up as the fall guy. (He need not have worried; he received the
Presidential Medal of Freedom instead.)

At the very least, then, President Bush knew his assertions to the
country about the threat posed by Saddam were on shaky ground. It was
presumably on the basis of Tenet's slam-dunk evidence that
then-Secretary of State Colin Powell presented maps identifying 600
weapons sites to the United Nations a few weeks later, none of which
in fact existed. The president of the United States has a duty to be
fully truthful and conscientious when committing its armed forces to
battle; it is certain that President Bush was not.

More than 2,200 American servicemen and women have now died in Iraq;
20,000 have sustained casualties. They were sent to a place where they
should never have been to fight a war that lacked all justification.

In addition, the United States under President Bush has breached the
United Nations Charter in waging war in defiance of the international
community, deliberately misrepresenting the terms of U.N. Resolution
1441 in doing so, and ignoring the reports of the United Nations' own
weapons inspectors in Iraq. Bush further violated the Geneva
Conventions on warfare and the treatment of prisoners, as well as
federal law and U.S. military regulations on these subjects. His
actions, which are ongoing, have brought deep dishonor to the United
States and reckless assertions of presidential authority to set aside
Acts of Congress and international commitments at will.

(2) The president has obstructed justice. One of the articles of
impeachment against Richard Nixon was that he had obstructed justice
in the investigation of the Watergate break-in and burglary. President
Bush has in all likelihood similarly obstructed justice in the federal
investigation concerning the leak of Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA
agent in July 2003 as an act of retribution against her husband, who
had revealed the falsity of the administration's claims about Saddam's
efforts to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program. The leak of Plame's
identity, which put her and other agents at risk, is a violation of
federal law. A Justice Department investigation of the matter has now
been ongoing for more than two years. Robert Novak, the columnist who
revealed her identity, has now asserted that the president has known
the leak's name all along. The White House has not disputed this
claim. If substantiated, it would convict Bush of obstruction of
justice and require his removal from office. (One would also like to
know whether, in addition to having criminally complicit knowledge,
Bush authorized the leak himself.)

(3) The president has illegally imprisoned and permitted torture of
American citizens. John Walker Lindh, the so-called American Taliban
seized in Afghanistan, was confined in a cage with serious wounds
untreated after his capture. His abuse and humiliation were publicly
displayed. No one was held responsible for these actions. Jose Padilla
and Yaser Esam Hamdi, both American citizens, were taken into secret
military custody, interrogated in violation of their constitutional
rights and held incommunicado for years without charge and for a long
period, without access to counsel. Hamdi was deported without trial to
Saudi Arabia. Padilla remains in custody. After being subjected to a
succession of defamatory accusations by the government, he has finally
been charged with lesser offenses and remanded to federal court, a
move undertaken by the administration only in an attempt to preclude a
hearing of his case by the U.S. Supreme Court. These displays of open
contempt for the judicial process and the protections of habeas corpus
put the rights of every American in jeopardy.

(4) The president has conducted illegal surveillance of Americans in
violation of the Constitution and of federal statute and has claimed
extraordinary powers to ignore statutory requirements at discretion,
thus violating his oath to faithfully execute the laws. It is this
last proposed article that most clearly signifies America's
constitutional crisis. As the New York Times has disclosed in a story
that might have tipped the balance of the 2004 presidential election
but for the de facto censorship that concealed it for more than a
year, the National Security Agency, which recently placed a
recruitment ad in The Triangle, has been conducting warrantless
surveillance of Americans in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the
Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 for the past four years
under direct presidential order. FISA itself provided the mere fig
leaf of a secret court to authorize wiretaps; of more than 19,000
requested of it, only five were rejected. As if this were not leeway
enough, the Act further provided that, in case of emergency, the NSA
could initiate taps without approval, provided only that the court was
notified within 72 hours.

Even this, however, was too rigorous a standard for the Bush
administration, which claimed that modern communications technology
had made court oversight of any kind unduly burdensome. The remedy for
this, of course, was to seek new law, but instead Bush and his lawyers
simply decided to ""interpret"" FISA's intent in such a way as to negate
its practical application. Since FISA was no ordinary Act, but one
that created a new federal court, this meant that Bush had nullified a
statute and a judicial body at one stroke, thus leaving him as the
sole judge of the laws and of his own conduct. The common name for a
political system in which the legislative and judicial branches of
government have been subordinated to the will of the executive branch
is dictatorship. It is precisely the system that Bush is attempting to
create. The only proper response to this is impeachment.

What applies to Bush applies a fortiori to Vice President Cheney,
whose own former chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby, has already been
indicted in the Plame case. I am not sure whether the country is ready
for a President Dennis Hastert or whether Speaker Hastert himself will
survive the Abramoff lobbying scandal now about to engulf Washington.
Somewhere in the line of constitutional succession, however, it is to
be hoped that an honest man can be found. When England's Parliament
passed an act in 1641 calling upon King Charles I to call it into
session at no more than three-year intervals, it provided for the
King's failure to do so by empowering a series of lesser officials
down to the level of local magistrates to summon it. Right now, any
dogcatcher in the nation would have to be regarded as a successor
preferable to George W. Bush.

 You personally got 17 of the 20 people correct and were better at recognizing girls than guys. Overall, you guessed better than 94% of all test takers.

Last summer I went into this local store to buy a loaf of bread. I'd gotten into the habit of doing this more often than I might have otherwise, as the gal at the counter was rather interesting, in a dorky/geeky/queergirl sort of way. But this day when was done paying for the bread, I tried to give her a flyer to an upcoming drag king show. Her response was, ""Sorry, I'm not gay."" Not that you have to be queer to go to a drag king show, but I was worried, thinking maybe my Gaydar wasn't working so well! 

Tonight I think maybe I know something she didn't! :)"

"event","Ok, so I woke up at 2am this morning with the idea for a drag skit floating through my head. I don't know if that means I'm spending too much time thinking about such things lately, or if it was just a fluke. 

It was a good idea too, and I still remember it, despite still being rather sick. I've been sleeping 10+ hours a night the last 4 nights- maybe my brain decided as I wasn't going to be getting much done during my waking hours, we may as well use this sleep time for something more productive. 

My <i>nose</i> has been terribly productive these same 4 days tho. 

Oh! And here it is the second week of February and I saw a hummingbird yesterday. There are a lot of flowers blooming around the city throughout the winter, I wonder if the hummingbirds actually fly any farther south.

"event","1.11.4 Dreamed w/ crow/raven, 1st time in a long while. A lake freezing over, moss growing out onto the ice from stones that stuck up through the surface of the water. I was surprised to see how fast it grew, that it would spread to the ice during the course of a night. I could see moss on the bottom of the lake/pond where it had grown on ice before and then fallen to the bottom when the ice melted. 

A crow foraging on the ice off to my right, I'm concerned it might get fall through the thin parts of the ice and get cold and wet. I don't remember if it did at all- something about modes? It flew to a leafless tree near me to my left. I dropped something- food? a stick/toy? a cluster of crow feathers? onto the shore below me. It's a narrow strip of shore about 5 feet below the top of the steep bank where I sit. 

She flew down there right away to get what I'd dropped, I was pleased to get to see her being so close and unafraid. She returned to her tree perch but then came to offer me something- feathers? a stick? inreturn. She stayed on the ground near me and I began to pet/preen her. She liked it an came close, snuggly. I wanted to be close and wondered at the way she/he smelled. Crows have a certain strongish smell to them and sometimes I can enjoy it. 

I think she/he may have tickled my neck with her bill. At this point I recognized she/he as an avatar/embodiment of Raven/Crow, which made their gender uncategorizable/irrelevant.Our sizes grew more similar- she larger or me smaller- I had no context to know which way it happened. Things got hotter- pressing up against each other, me on my back, holding her/him to me. Very yummy-as I wrote in my journal I noted that I was getting aroused remembering it. 

I don't remember ze touching my breasts at all bit I didn't feel a lack of attention. In much of the last parts of the dream I was kind of aware that the sensations happening between us weren't really coming from the meetings of our anatomies, that there was a magic that helped us mesh together, a suspension of logic that allowed us to touch each other more intimately. 

Ze eased up a bit, cooling things off, and we kissed a few times, tongues and bill (bills?), very wow. She said ""one last kiss before I go"" and after that kiss I woke up!

At the time I felt the parting was just the end of our encounter/bring/sharing/intimacy event but now I'm wondering if it wasn't something bigger. Will we be connected any more? The last year or more we seem to have been apart. 

I saw 9 crows standing near each other @ the Chapman school the day before, facing into the wind with the sun shining on them and the grass. A tenth crow behind them was flying low to join them as I went inside."

"event","So back in June or July I was one of the many, many PDX dykes who had huge crushes on <a href=""http://www.johnnymozzarella.com"">Johnny Mozzarella</a> and would have loved to get anywhere near his pants. This king was coming on strong in town and even got himself on the cover of <a href=""http://www.justout.com"">Just Out</a>.

Well, since then I've gotten into doing drag king performance myself and Mr. Mozzarella's been integral to organizing the shows I've been a part of. So the crush has worn off (though I still wouldn't mind a bit of ..mmmm... nookie, of course) to the point where when I kissed per as a part of my act the other week I didn't think much of it. It was unplanned, so it was kind of fun to surprise per, but it wasn't like I went home feeling all excited about it. It wasn't till a few days later that I was like, hey, I kissed Johnny Mozzarella (yay!)! 

Sometimes I see how much things in my life change and feel like I can't possibly know what life is really like- if my perspectives can shift so much season to season and year to year, where's the rock where I can base any judgements on? Obviously I can float along on my current feelings, but knowing that they change so much makes me unable to put much conviction into my opinions. Hmmm.... but then, I'm quite a passionate and energetic person, so I tend to hit things pretty full-on when I can and pick up the pieces later :) Ramble, ramble, ramble. Maybe this all makes me more willing to explore new stuff?"

It was bad enough losing our fight to keep the anti-gay-marriage crap out of our state's constitution, but then finding that Kerry didn't make it either... ugh. I'm worried that things will get really fucking scary with 4 more years of Bush (who the hell thought that was a <i>good</i> idea, anyway? You've got to have your head pretty deep in a hole (or have your income well-supplanted by war/oil/corporate welfare profits) to think that the last four years have been happy sunshine-y goodness. Pass the K-Y, please, I think I'm gonna need it) and by the time I decide it's too scary to stay in this wonderful town any more they'll have made it impossible to leave. And what if everyone cool leaves the state for greener pastures?

One of the employees at Goodwill says ""either you missed your calling or you're a high-fashion model,"" some guy at in a convenience-store lot whistles at me as I bike by, some guy in a BMW follows me in first gear for 3 blocks and twists his neck almost 180 degrees trying to see which way I went when I suddenly hit the brakes and take a left to lose him and one more guy in a white City of Portland pickup truck beeps and leers at me as I finally near the office where I'm volunteering. 

I know our culture encourages guys to do shit like this and also encourages women to generally exhibit more respect in their way of letting you know you look good, but still, it would be nice to have some cute dyke beep her horn at me once in a while. And you men can give it a rest now and then too, you know? 4 times in a half hour... yeesh. I don't look /that/ fucking good."

Portland, OR is a skirt made out of green living leaves.

Salt Lake City, UT is a pair of Khaki shorts.

Seattle, WA is a denim kilt. Though it was probably a waffle-weave thermal shirt under flannel in the late 80's-early 90's :)

Portland, ME is an old pair of overalls with lots of bright, multicolored patches.

Boston, MA is an punky worn-out old black jean jacket with some holes and a few metal studs remaining.

----On July 4th, Sparkleheart presents the Miss Burly-Q BBQ Pageant. Come early for a homo-liscious bbq and makeovers. Stay late for the filthiest pageant alive!!! followed by a dirty dance party! 

If you hate beauty pageants, you will love the Miss Burly-Q. Be there or be square!-----

I went outside for air after it finished and found myself crying, it had hit me so hard. Absolutely amazing."

<font size=""+0"" color=""#FFFAB8"">You are the Devil card. The Devil is based on the figure Pan, Lord of the Dance. The earthy physicality of the devil breeds lust. The devil's call to return to primal instincts often creates conflict in a society in which many of these instincts must be kept under control. Challenges posed by our physical bodies can be overcome by strength in the mental, emotional, and spiritual realms.<br>
Pan is also a symbol of enjoyment and rules our material creativity. The devil knows physical pleasure and how to manipulate the physical world. Material creativity finds its output in such things as dance, pottery, gardening, and sex. The self-actualized person is able to accept the sensuality and usefulness of the devil's gifts while remaining in control of any darker urges.

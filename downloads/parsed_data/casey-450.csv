"event","man i knew as soon as we pulled up and everyone was lookin at us crazy it wasn't gonna be a good night. im not gonna go into too much detail but i thought that was the new chill spot but when people start talkin about callin the police its definitely time to go.....

i moved to outbound at work making more money and better hours so thats cool, plus im with my friends.

darrel is getting his truck tomorrow. that should be good if everything goes right. you gonna see us ridin by in the baby blue 'burban.

we leave for vacation in two weeks and when i get back i will be starting BCC. all i'm worried about is getting my schedule so that i can continue my work-out progress. i recommend the YMCA to anyone looking for a gym to hit up. theres alot of cool people there and i seem to stay focused on my lifting when im there.

anyone thats been watching Dallas has seen the rookie i've been talking about. Julius Jones the next Emmitt Smith or Curtis Martin. he has been carrying Dallas to victory the past few weeks and i would like to think that they would have won more if he hadn't had injured most of the season....

well thats it for now i haven't posted in a while so this is basically me catching up."

"event","man there is no hell like a nurse that cant find your vain due to dehydration.....
i had to go to Parish today and have an endoscopy to find out what the fuck is wrong with me. first i couldnt have anything to drink after 12 last night. i was so damn thirsty its not funny. after we got to the hospital they said that the procedure would require us to get financial aid... aint that a bitch! so we went and while applying i wanted to know around how much we were lookin at here, the lady at the F.A. office didnt know but she said it was definitely over $2000. i thought to my self ""hmm looks like im never coming here again cause thats a whole lot of money that they will never see"". so then i go and check in in to a large room full of people waiting to be admitted to surgery. i assumed i would be waiting a few hours at least because of the amount of people there before me. i was wrong i was called like thirty seconds after sitting down... it was tight. i felt like looking back at everybody and saying ""ha bitches, financial aids a mother fucker!"" but of course they're sick too so i didnt. oh yea and im not No Limit. i walked back to the prep. area with an old guy and he was telling me about the procedure and then he mentioned colonoscopy.... man i stopped dead in my tracks. i was like WHA?!?! no endoscopy. then he was like yea yea thats what i meant. so i already got a bad feeling about this and when i get to the bed the nurse told me to put on the hospital robe ( you know the one with your ass hanging out the back ) well i had decided to leave my pants on so then it was just like changing shirts. after that the lady damn near gave me a physical. checked my temperature, blood pressure, pulse, breathing, and throat. she then took blood and put the i.v. in my hand. not after tying off my arm like an addict and tapping my hand for like five minutes did she find a vain, or at least i thought. she stuck that big ass iv needle in my arm and started digging around for a vain... she said she couldn't find one because i was starting to show signs of dehydration. now come on they told me nothing to eat or drink after midnight. i drank as much as i could at midnight though. after that she just asked me a bunch of questions and the rolled my bed around to a few different rooms.... that was kinda cool. and when i got to the room that they were saying the ""surgery"" was taking place i was playing with the camera until the doctor put the anesthesia into my i.v. then i was gone. they said i snored through the ""surgery"" i was out of it for a while after that and i got rolled around in a wheel chair in the elevators and stuff it was also cool. then me and my mom went to the cafeteria, grubbed out and then left.

i came home and went to sleep some more until Nate and Darrin came and got me we went to Nates house to play Halo 2 but i ended up just falling asleep in Nates back room. and that brings me to know where i have been typing here. Darrin, George and I are going to a Primerica meeting tonight and then who knows after that. anyone that has any plans call the cell let me know..."

"event","last night was tight. we went to sun-cruz then protocol then hooters then wal-mart then protocol then hess and in between all that there was a bunch of talking in parking lots and driving too fucking fast. i don't think we would have had as much fun if the sun-cruz was open... so it worked out better.

"event","it really seems like its a struggle to spend time or even see Haley, it is really getting old, seriously. i mean i know i work until 12 but on weekends we should be able to hang out. hell even wednesday night because there was no school thursday. plans were made for wednesday night, she even came to my job when i was on break but somehow we didnt meet up after that. friday night well anyone thats gonna read this was here. i wanted you to hang out, at first i didnt wanted julia to come over but once you guys were here it was cool. you guys stayed for about ten minutes and then left to go smoke pot. and last night i called you before work and you said you wanted me to come over and go in the hot tub with you and when i get out of work i call and your asleep. its all good though it just feels like im getting nowhere always trying to make plans and they never work. i figured we were gonna hang out today i told you to call me when you left amys and i called at around five and it seemed like you didnt even wanna talk. you just wanted to watch whatever movie was on. hopefully you will come over before we leave tonight. probably not though.

well moving on to more positive things daniels brother came down yesterday and we're all goin on the floating casino tonight.... trying to practice for next month. last night was fun as hell thanks to my cousin. tonight should be interesting.... me, nate, daniel, darrin, darrel, george, kenny, john, and whoever else wants to go....

also on friday i am going to try and get my tattoo. hopefully i can get it before work.

**Haley just called and i dont think she wants to leave that movie to come over its alright though.
well thats all for today i might write when i get home if anything happens. peace"

"event","i had to wake up so damn early because Haley had to go to school. she slept here last night... i dont really know whats going on with us.... Haley respond and let me know. i was gonna go back to sleep because i have to work until midnight tonight, oh well i'll probably just be tired. i dont know if i have to work tomorrow but i'll probably hang out with my nef. for a little while. i was contemplating going to the fair and after talking to daniel i really dont even care if i go or not. the fair is fun when your in school and after you've been a couple times it is just the same thing. if anyone reads this today and wants to hang out after i get off at 12 call my cell and i'll call you back on break. Cody made a comment comparing the cocoa boys situation with San Andreas, i was kinda mad when he posted that but looking back on it now it kinda seems like that. when the cops wont do anything about a stolen car it does seem like were in a video game or something..... it makes me wonder what we could get away with........."

"event","i decided i might as well give this a shot. everyone else seems to have one of these journals and i figured this is a good place to say what i want to say, so here goes....

there has been a lot of shit thats been going on lately and most of its bullshit. most people that will be reading this know what im talking about but for those of you who dont, im talking about a certain group of people that have decided that they can run around doing what they want to do and fighting or jumping whoever they want to because they have so many people behind them. now everything that went down friday has made me realize a lot of things about a lot of people. first big props go out to Sam Eady, he and i had a misunderstanding a little while back and im glad its all resolved now. also Ricky gets props, he talks alot about what he would do and when it came down to the wire he was down. on the other end of the spectrum people that talked the most (c-low) and were there originally (adam) were nowhere to be found when it all went down. i feel that if you say your down you need to be down no one is forcing anyone to be involved if they dont want to i just feel its the right thing to do. i know i have been talk about this situation for the last couple days but it has been a big part of my life since friday. anyone that knows the situation please respond and let me know what you think.

the presidential election is on right now and Bush has been stuck at 269 votes for about an hour (270 needed for elction). Kerry's votes continue to increase and its looking more and more promising for him, we'll just have to wait and see what happens.....

i started my job back at Protocol yesterday and plan to keep that job for a while. i am also trying to get a job at ron jons resort.... thats not looking as promising as it did, but oh well i really dont need that job it would be a nice cushion money wise though. Protocol hasnt changed much since i left and everyone that was there when i was there remembers me so thats good, i dont have to go through the uncomfortable new guy thing. i should be working from about 3 until 12.

well thats been the main things in my life recently, and having covered that i will be able to make entries on current issues and update on things i mentioned here in this entry."

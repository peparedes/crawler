"event","So, there's something about living that seems to suck up all my time.  On the other hand, I don't have any classes today, so I'll try to write a proper update on the last month and a half (both on my site [http://www.skidmore.edu/~l1elliot] and via e-mail) and get it out today.  Or tomorrow, depending on which side of the dateline you are.



I've had a great time; Halloween and Thanksgiving were both wonderful, even so far from home.  I'm a little more worried about Christmas (many of the other foreigners are traveling), but I'm sure it'll all work out.  My biggest concern is graduate school.  I really like living here in Gunma, and I think that I could be happy for another year.  But I don't want too let any grass grow between my college record and graduate school.  It's become one of those things that just keeps building and building until it seems too big to deal with, and so gets put off more.  But I still have some time to get applications in, if I can just figure out where I want to apply.  *Sigh*



On the up side, I think my Japanese is improving; this weekend I got an eye exam, bought new glasses, and got a haircut.  All mostly in Japanese (and some of the random and desperate gestures that seem to be a staple to my foreign language experience).  I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving break (if you still get one), and is looking forward to a good holiday season!"

"event","Yup.&nbsp; Or at least as close as I have ever been.&nbsp; And my legs hurt. &nbsp; All thanks to an after-work party (enkai) &nbsp;with my Japanese co-workers.&nbsp; I had heard about these, and was eagerly awaiting the first.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's was celebrating the Sports Day (more on that,&nbsp;the party, and pictures!&nbsp;later on my blog).&nbsp; &nbsp;I really enjoyed myself (although some of that might be the alcohol talking ...).&nbsp; A number of teachers that I have never talked with approached me after the first 2 or 3 rounds had gone through, and struck up conversations.&nbsp; I am still surprised at how many people speak a little English.&nbsp; With my limited Japanese, we can get on alright, although no new philosophies will be born from these conversations.&nbsp; It turns out that one of the math teachers passed a high level English exam (twice!) but won't speak English with me.&nbsp; I guess that really shows the gap between having a good memory for vocabulary and grammar rules and actually speaking the language.&nbsp; Something for me to keep in mind as I teach my kids, and work on my own language skills.&nbsp; I met a staff member that I had never seen before.&nbsp; We sat next to each other, and by the end of the night I have a promise for all sorts of new Japanese food; he seems excited to get me to try as much as he can.&nbsp; It turns out that he is also a Bonsai master, and promised to give me a bonsai of my own tomorrow!&nbsp; We'll see how that turns out, but he dragged other teachers into it, so I feel pretty confident that a &quot;small, hardy, beautiful&quot; bonsai will soon be gracing my apartment!!<br /><br />Some of this was the alcohol, but I also think that the enkai has an atmosphere that encourages people to break out of their more reserved roles.&nbsp; For instance, the 1st year Japanese teacher only had soft drinks, but spent the evening talking with me in English (I didn't know he knew any).&nbsp; His level of grammar isn't much more than what my 3rd year students know, but we had a pretty good conversation getting to know each other.&nbsp; I'm impressed how much can be expressed in simple sentences.&nbsp; After 4 years of college, I am used to thinking only in more complicated forms, but the simpler ones get the information across just as well.&nbsp; Another point to remember while teaching.&nbsp; After such a great time, I will definitely make a point of going to others (even though they're sort of expensive).&nbsp; Please look for more info on my blog this weekend (<a href=""http://www.skidmore.edu/~l1elliot"">http://www.skidmore.edu/~l1elliot</a>)."

"event","Last weekend, I went to a pre-departure&nbsp;orientation for JET in NYC.  While waiting for the subway, I sat next to two Japanese women; an auspicious beginning for this, I thought. Then it turns out that the guy sitting on the other side of me was not only going to the same orientation, but his placement is in the same prefecture as me!  At the orientation, I met a lot of people in my prefecture, including a guy that will be working in the same town as me. The orientation allayed a lot of my current fears about leaving for Japan (how many gifts to I really need to bring? how many pairs of shoes?)  Even better than that, I received an e-mail yesterday from the woman who I will be replacing.&nbsp; It seems like she really enjoyed her time in Shibukawa, so I am even more excited to go. I will be teaching at a Junior High School, but one day a week I will be in one of the attached elementary schools.&nbsp; That sounds like the really fun part of the job, where I get paid to play English based games will little kids.  I am not so excited to learn that I will also be teaching the third-years (9th grade here) ""international classes"". I have no idea what that means, but I hope to find out more soon. Now I just need to buy a whole new wardrobe (like I will be able to find clothes in Japan...), a laptop, and gifts for anyone and everyone I might meet over there. I am looking for suggestions on those: what fairly inexpensive, small, and light (there's a pretty low limit on the luggage that we can take) gifts would express upstate New York.

Any suggestions on what laptop would be best? I'm looking to buy for the long term, but since I've never had one before, I'm not really sure what to look for."

"event","This week I attended the East Coast Protozoology Conference at <st1:placename w:st=""on"">Russell</st1:placename> <st1:placename w:st=""on"">Sage</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st=""on"">College</st1:placetype> in <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Troy</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st=""on"">NY</st1:state></st1:place>. Not too far from my backyard, and it was science for 3 days. But the best part was being able to see the Dr. Domozychs again. And they let me stay at their house during the conference. So, barely 2 weeks after graduating, I was back in <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Saratoga</st1:city></st1:place>, and even stopped by Skidmore's Biology Department. (I would have dropped in too see everyone, but the conference took up the whole day, and I'm not so smooth socially that I know how to ask former professors to drop me off downtown so I can hang with my friends, but come back and crash at their place. But I will try to get back up to <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Saratoga</st1:city></st1:place> to see you before I leave!)<br /><br />Here's a little about the conference for those so inclined.&nbsp; Otherwise, feel free to skip to the next paragraph.&nbsp; Since this was the defacto national conference for protistologists, this wasn't quite my normal crowd, but I learn some interesting new techniques, and got to talk with a few people about my work. I didn't present at this, but David (Dr. Domozych) spoke a little about the work we did, so I got some questions. And I meet a Skidmore alumina from the class of '87, who was a student of David's, but now works for State Department of Health and presented about her work (RNA editing, so I could even follow it!) One thing that I've come to realize after going to these conferences is that I have no real desire to enter into the field of systematics, or phylogenics. I don't really like seeing the taxonomy that I thought was so static changed and twisted. I can appreciate when that might be necessary, but I'm not sure that moving from basing everything on morphology to basing everything on molecular data or ""DNA barcoding"" is right. If we create species based on a few base differences in a rRNA subunit, what is our definition of species? I think we (the scientific community) really needs to think about this before we go switching everything around. But it was invigorating to be involved in this sort of exchange of ideas, and it made me realize what an impact the enthusiasm of the PI makes in my interest in a topic. For those that heard Dr. Sam Bowser speak about foraminifera a few months ago (and I know that applies to so many...), I was so impressed with his work and topic at the time. I heard several members of his lab speak at this conference, and while I can see why foraminifera are so cool, I wasn't as blown away without his dynamic personality<br /><br />
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Although I greatly enjoyed the science component, I think that my favorite part of this week was going to the ""raceino"". The Domozychs took me there for dinner, and then we bet on a horse race and played the video machines. I think they got a real kick out of ""corrupting"" me like that. And on the upside, I won $10 ($4 after my loss at the track...), so I had a fun time. I truly love the Domozychs, and I so happy that I was able to meet them at Skidmore.<br /> <br /> Yesterday I received an e-mail from someone on the Board of Education in <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:placename w:st=""on"">Shibukawa</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st=""on"">City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, where I will be living next year.&nbsp; I was so glad to get it; I have been rushing to get the mail everyday since graduation, waiting to hear something from them.&nbsp; I was so touched by the note that I want to put it here (also because his written English seems to be about the same level as my written Japanese, so the first months in <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> could be interesting...)</p>

"event","I know, we never thought this could happen, but it has.  I'm am now more nerdy than I was before.  Last weekend I went to the Northeast Algal Society (NEAS) annual meeting, and presented my work there.  See, these past 2 years spent in the lab had a payoff.  Of an algae conference.... Anyway, I had a great time, heard about another girl that is going to Japan on the same program that I am, and in general reveled in the concentrated science.  When else can you get 14 people for dinner at Olive Garden, and hear them talking about sugar linkages, core components, fern life cycles, algae, etc.?  My talk went well, although someone else won the prize for the undergraduates.  I got a lot of good feedback on my presentation and my research, which is what I was looking for anyway.  I'll be giving the talk again for <b>Academic Festival (Wednesday, May 3 from 12:00 - 12:30PM in Boloton 282)</b>.  There will be balloon ""animals"" (desmids).  For those of you abroad, I'll see if we can get it videotaped, so you too can experience the joy of algae.

Okay, I'll give you a moment for you brain to recover from that massive hit of science.  Better now?

Today the whole ""graduation"" thing became much more real.  I picked up my cap and gown.  And then promptly lost them.  I brought it to class, and set it behind me.  I left class, and with a bounce in my step headed off to relax in the lab, only to realize a sudden lack of graduation gear.  So, I ran back and did a frantic search of the classroom before the next class in there got started.  No gown in sight.  I asked all my classmates whom I could still find hanging around, and the professor, but no one had seen it or had picked it up for me.  My last hope resided in Stacie, who had sat next to me.  There was an additional wrinkle with Stacie.  Today she was participating in the Day of Silence (to raise awareness of the discrimination and hate crimes against Gay/Lesbian/etc. people).  All of which meant that I couldn't very well call her to ask if she had my stuff.  Long story short, I tracked her down in the Dinning Hall, with my cap and gown.  We pantomimed back and forth about it.  (I'm not really sure why <i>I</i> was pantomiming; I hadn't agreed to be silent all day.)  But how crazy is this: the gown comes with instructions on how to wear it.  AND I COULDN'T FIGURE THEM OUT THE FIRST TIME THROUGH.  Not only do I not want to graduate right now, but they are making it difficult to do so, in the area that should be the easiest.  That's just not cool.

And for those of you who haven't reapplied to the Honors Forum yet, please be sure to do so.  It really is fast, and we're not looking for much this year except that you fill it out.  That's all we're asking, really."

"event","I just received notice today that I have been accepted into the JET Program!  I won't know until next month where I will be placed, but since I plan on taking any placement (even the top of a mountain or a remove fishing village) I don't think it really matters.  So, at this point my plans for immediately after graduation are set: at least 1 year teaching in Japan.  However, this news is bittersweet: two good friends that also applied and had interviews for this program did not get jobs.  I guess I was always assuming that we would be going together and that built-in friendship and contact would follow me from Saratoga Springs to Japan.  But I guess this will be more of an adventure than I originally thought.

On a separate note, I had the strangest conversation around a printer in the library last night.

"event","So, for those who care and/or don't know, I have applied to the JET (Japanese Exchange and Teaching Program) for after graduation.  I applied for the assistant language teacher position, which means that I want to be an English teacher in Japanese Elementary, Middle or High Schools next year.  I made it through the first round of cuts, and had my interview today.

I think the interview went well.  I could have given better or fuller answers to some of the questions.  For instance, I don't think saying that I would bring my stuffed yeast as a representation of myself was the best answer, but it certainly was the honest one!  In general, though, my committee of interviewers were responsive and smiled and laughed often.  Either I made a complete fool of myself, they were just really nice people, or they actually enjoyed the interview.  Even though I know in at least one case it was #1, I hope it was #3. (#1 was when I held the backs of my hands to the side of my head to imitate Snoopy when one of my ""students"" [the interviewers] said that was the character she liked ... ask me to show you the gesture, if you want).  I'll find out in April how this really went and if I will be in Japan next fall.

Anyway, this seems like the sort of important, life altering information that should go up on live journal (I know, no angst, but what do you really expect from something I write?)."

"event","Today I had a seminar on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).  I got some new information, but not a lot.  But I started to think that maybe that's because I'm a Biology major.  So, I want to know:  

How much do you know about GMOs? 
Can you define what they are? 
Do you know how they are made?  
Do you think they're good, bad, or are you indifferent?  
Do you feel that they are a threat to human health?  To the environment?  
Should they banned or encouraged?  

I realize that everyone has busy lives now, but if you're bored, I would love to hear what you think.  I think that we are all intelligent and well-educated (or at least I hope that's what our money is going towards).  But I realize that you, my lovelies, aren't science majors, and I wonder what the ""lay"" preception on this issue is.  And in a bit I'll post the answers (for those questions not opinion-dependent)."

"event","Here is a brief synopsis of my 21st birthday (for those who care to know)

<bl>My parents and sister came to Ithaca to celebrate with me.  But today is also the anniversary of my sister's obsession with Johnny Depp.  So, of course, we saw <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>.  I have to say, it was a great movie.  I can't decide if I like the Ompalumpas or the squirrels better.  And Johnny Depp was good (although I'd never admit that in front of Robin)

<bl>For dinner we went to a Japanese restaurant in Collegetown.  The food was amazing, and brought back all sorts of happy memories from my trip there.  I really do want to go back after graduation.

<bl>As for my (obligatory?) alcohol consumption, I ordered a glass of ume (plum) wine with dinner.  AND DIDN'T GET CARDED.  Now, I ask you, what is the point of doing everything right for so many years if I can't feel vindicated at the end?  Of course, my current license still has the big ""Under 21"" stamped on it (and expires today) so I don't think I will be indulging any more until my new one arrives.  I just don't want to deal with the explaination of when my birthday was, and why I don't have a new card.  Maybe I'll just use my passport as my id.

<bl>As for gifts, I got the new Harry Potter (yes, I am a nerd, but you knew that already), a monkey card (that made my day) and a piece of cloth that is the ""North Woods Scat Guide.""  I love my family.  My housemates got me a card, and I love some of their messages:

""You Rock. Many happy returns. May your DNAs never degrade.""
""Have a great b-day!  Hope you get some cool gifts, like a DNA sequencer!""
""Have a happy b-day and keep on truckin' Skidmore..."""

"event","I'm only guessing that my summer at Cornell is like that; I never actually went to camp as a child (or should I say when I was younger, since I still don't consider myself an adult?)  I'm living in a house with 15 other Biology/Chemistry/Computer Science/Pre-Med majors.  As much as I value my liberal arts education (after all, that's the reason I'm at Skidmore and not at Cornell permanently), I have found it quite fun to talk about microscopy or quantum physics without everyone else getting that blank look in their eyes.  One night this week I was up until midnight having a discussion on plant intelligence.  When I came back to the house today, I found a copy of the latest <i>National Geographic</i>.  In case you haven't seen it, the main article this month is about Stem Cell research.  Now, I don't want you to think that this house is all science and no play.  Last night we bought beers/drinks (and by ""we"" I mean everyone but me) and watched a pirated copy of <i>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</i>.  The movie was actually quite good.  Lots of action, but a great deal of humor as well, especially in the exchanges between the leads.  

The lab work is good.  I finally got some things to do this week (which makes me feel less guilty about picking up my paycheck on Monday).  If anyone is curious, I'm spending my summer identifying editing sites in the mitochondrial RNA of two ecotypes of <i>Arabidopsis</i> where the amount of editing differs between the two ecotypes.  (see, that's the blank stare I was talking about before).  What that means is lots and lots of little tubes, and hours spent on the computer looking at graphs.  Not a bad way to spend the summer, if you're a science nerd like me.  Especially with such a nice place to come back to."

"event","Well, I have safely arrived at Cornell, and am looking forward to getting into a lab on Monday.  If you have never been to Ithaca, NY, it is a beautiful part of the state.  I am right by Cayuga Lake (one of the Finger Lakes), and the area is full of gorges, waterfalls, and forests.  I house that I am staying in is nice (although the only bathroom on my floor is the men's room and I can't figure out how to open the windows in the room).  I'm not sure how I feel about having a roommate.  I haven't had to share a room with anyone since first semester freshmen year (I drove my roommate next door then).  So I don't really have much experience in this.  Hopefully, our interest in science will carry us through.  

On a more exciting note, I think that I am in love.  In love with Wegmans.  It is the most amazing grocery store that I have ever seen.  I was overwhelmed as soon as I walked in.  It has restaurants <i>inside the store</i>.  And the most amazing selection of Japanese/Asian food that I have seen (outside of Japan).  Please remember that I am a country bumpkin, and scale the previous comment appropriately.  I am so happy now, because I have Udon and Kola cookies in my drawer.  I know, I'm easy to please.  I think this will become my weekend fun: hanging out at Wegmens.  Hey, I admit that I have no life.

"event","So, I don't know what you guys did this holiday weekend, but I just finished up the bi-annual family garage sale.  If felt good to get rid of some things, especially after the disastrous time I had getting everything home this semester (I had to repack the car twice to get it all to fit.  For a while there, I thought I might have to leave my little sister behind and pick her up the next morning).  Other than that, my life hasn't been too exciting.  I've gardened, which makes me very happy, and finished some books that I started at school.  
I think the most exciting thing that has happened so far (other than having a pile of bills in my wallet now) was seeing the local Methodist Church's BBQ.  In the Cobleskill area, there is a BBQ company called Brooks'; just about every group that does a fund-raiser hires them  A part of the Brooks' experience is the large yellow chicken suit that they bring.  Someone in the group always puts it on, and tries to flag down cars to the fund-raiser.  This time, someone from the Methodist Church was wearing it, but with a slight variation.  The chicken was wearing the biggest cross that I have ever seen!  At first, I didn't believe that it really had a cross on, and drove around the block again so that I check.  In all honesty, what does a chicken have to do with Christianity?  I know my religious up bringing is far from perfect, but I think I would remember a passage about BBQ....
Speaking of religion, my aunt (very religious), uncle and cousin visited.  It was interesting, since I haven't seen my cousin for 15 years, and my aunt or uncle for 3.  It was strange to welcome a stranger as family.  I wasn't sure if we would really get along, but since they only stayed for one night, it didn't really matter.  We actually got along well (she's the same age as me, but a little wilder than me [like every other person our age]).  I hope that, should I see her again in the next 15 years, we can keep up a friendly relationship.
Well, that seems like enough of an update for now.  When I go out to Cornell next week and find out my address for the summer, I'll try to remember to post it here, just in case you wanted to send my (hate) mail or something. =)"

"event","Last night I attended a bonfire with some of my friends from High School, and I realized what good friends they are.  We talked about everything, not just what we did in High School.  This is truly the mark of a strong friendship.  Of course I miss my Skiddies, but I love all my friends and am glad to see that despite all the changes we've gone through these last few years, we kept those bonds and traits that made us friends in the first place.

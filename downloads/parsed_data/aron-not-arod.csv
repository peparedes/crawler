"event","Strange Day Today
Feels Like Friday Already

This past week, I've been kind of upset, because for some reason, I'm under the impression that although alot of people act nice to me, they don't like me behind my back.

I don't know why, but it's been a bit offputting.

But then, today I watched that movie ""It's A Wonderful Life"", in English class.
And I dont remember the last time a  movie had that kind of effect on me.

Suddenly I feel so optimistic about everything, life and such.

And I realized that its true that you really only do need a few friends (Steph, Becca, Niki, Pat, Felicia,..just to give some credit.)who are really going to be there for you. So after that movie, I've had a really good day.

And Christmas is exciting
I finished my presents
even though I dont think Becca's going to like hers.
and she gave me way too much, and I can't live up to that.

But whatever, because

It's A Wonderful Life"

"event","It was only a kiss
<i>It was only a kiss</i>

because im Mr. Brightside


Anyways.
Im annoyed. So I'm gonna vent

My family's dinner table has turned into hell, almost literally.

My stepfathers distressed over his upcoming brain surgery, so he's working my mom to the bone (i dont get the connection either.) But then we end up getting pizza, since she doesnt have time to cook, which he complains about. Then, he takes every possible oppurtunity to bitch out everyone that says anything. So, in the middle of him yelling at my mom, it's usually my duty to exclaim, ""I'm done"", and take the kids and baby downstairs to take their minds, which shouldn't be exposed to that kind of stuff anyways, off of it.

SO yeah. my life.
and now he's yelling at Kendall for being on the phone too long.
As if I need any more on my mind right now.

Bye all."

"event","We must take all of the prescriptions, for make-believe sicknesses

But there's never a prescription for a broken heart.


We must memorize our social security number, phone number, and credit card number

But never remember the numbers of an anniversary date.


We must spend 16 years of our childhood learning useless letters and numbers

But disregard learning of friendship, life, and love.



We must base our lives on a god, never seen or heard in 2000 years.

But are forced to choose from about 300 different ones.



We must love, based on what we see in movies.

But Never follow a single spontaneous movement in ourselves.
Never stray from the norm.
Never rebel against what we're told.




I need a forbidden love.
For it will break everything said.
We can run away.
Forget what has been told to us.
Live somewhere far away
With new identitys
And they'll never find us.
Love will keep us alive

the origins of the ocean
whispering
He Says
the tears of the heavens make the water
the thoughts of the gods make the fish
And every wave,
is the shuddering of the earth
at the sound of another broken heart
And the girl drifts away
into the crashing of the sea"

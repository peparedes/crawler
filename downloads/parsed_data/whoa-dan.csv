that verse ^ there really speaks for itself. its how i feel. its what i have to wake up2. its what i breathe.. like nothing better comes out of it. maybe im just Xaggerating but i dont know what to feel.0001.my emos are soPHuck'd up im YeRnIng to be better. this entree waznt gonna be about me self-loathing so lets moovee on2 else. #!#&*&%@ yeaaa baby!

i bought MeTeOrA 2dey!! GrEaT album. there's this one sAWng called Faint, which i realEE love. i like the fact that this album, like hYbrId thEorY, focuses on deep self-issues -- its a groovay exploration*  
toDay i was late
for the retreat at St. moNica's. it was quite amusing really, i was walking around back&forth in the yard cos i didnt know where to go. i walked into the downstairs chapel and i saw elderly PEOPLe praying so i was like ""shit, this isnt the one!"" i eventually found my way inside where evry1 was at  pulled up a chair '.' listened to [fr james] talking up a storm  ate a pretzel 
~big boooooiiiii eatin a pretzeeell~
then hed'd out to the chapel and just made the best out of the boring time. mike n matteo are so nuts['dont think nuts would be the right word to say, if you know what i mean'] i had a good time.

"event","wow, it been decades since ive came back here to update anything new. well things have been alright for me lately, apart from the slight alienation from friends and the not going to the prom thing, things are currently going fine. this weekend has been a good one. friday night i went over my cousin sara's cos it was her bday. i went with di and darlene, we were just hanging out.. watched alittle bit of ""To Wong Foo.."" and then ""The Ring"" which felt annoyingly long but was only like 2hrs. the cake was good too. 

last night, we went to jersey with Chris and just cruised around. we wanted to go see Willard at AMC theaters but we missed the 7:30 show and had to wait for the 10 o'clock show but Di had to be home by 11. so we crashed the mall instead. we went to deptford, it was cool there.. i bought a the new hit parader issue with Linkin Park on the cover. lemme tell ya, pizza at the mall is really fucking great! so we left the mall and was trying to find the car for like 20mins. we didnt know where it fucking was lol, we just walked around and around outside the mall. just to find out that it was only on the next side of the mall from where we started out from lol. it was just mayhem. we had to go thru inside the mall again, and they were closing up.. it was really strange cos it reminded me of fucking Dawn Of The Dead. which woulda been really cool to be in that kinda sitch.. zombies walking around and we're stuck in the mall, plus there were 4 of us.. about the same amount as the movie! haha. 

ive been really sick for the past week or so. i dont know, its like ive been having lots of mucus and snot.. and everytime i blow my nose, there would be blood there also. lol sorry for being sooo overly graphic but i did it for a reason, so that you know how i feel. wish me a get well!"

    The average blue whale produces over 400 gallons of sperm when it ejaculates, but only 10% of that actually makes it into his mate. So 360 gallons are spilled into the ocean every time one unloads its sperm. Then you wonder why the ocean water tastes salty. ;P"

"event","Life as a burning tree, how wonderful it must be. Burning inferno disintegrating my blind memory, from a body falling with debris. sweet sorrow the sounds of the crow, Death is pondering near as blissful tragedy he stole. Why have you forsaken me?! What makes this place so vaguely destructable with psycho-killing pedophiles and a plague of life-shortening diseases. The moment of satisfaction; happiness I milk from my manhood. Solitary confinements is the answer to all your timewasting questions.. fuck you for not taking the time to think! Gore and Carnage of infant skulls being ripped out of blooded genitals. Sadness plays its tune.. O Fortuna heals our wound. The Angel of Darkness is pondering near, as wasteful souls begin to beg and pray in exaggerated fear. Reigning with the Sword of All Source up high, as clouds turn to dust and the pigeons begin to cry. Is there hope left for me to feed on? Is this all that I have left to keep me from mass suicide? I'll be waiting on corners with a 40oz. and a dirty blanket to keep me warm, asking those bystanders and passengers for some chum change! Oh how I'd hate to be that burning tree.."

"event","Ahh! what a day i had!! today, i had puttin' on the hits to do, i was in 2acts. one with Scott we did SEV - Same Old Song , i'm sure you all probably heard of it[pepsi blue commercial] so anyways, and i also did Cannibal Corpse - A Skull Full Of Maggots with ""bol"" Mike and Bill and Sean. It was great, our 1st show was for the student body.. it went fairly well. the EmCee, Dan Concannon['cuse me for incorrect spelling, he's a senior] kept getting boo'd at LOL, it's just funny. shameful but funny! it was a surprise to me that mrs.KELLY performed too, she was opening act.. thank god! She, along with mr. MILES[principal] and fr.OLIVIERE[president], did P!NK - Get The Party Started. It was a huge relief for me really, cos me and SCOTT were set to be opening act too! I was backstage, cheering her on.. dancing too LOL ya kno, showing her some quick moves. 

then came the night show -- what a night it was! i was hella nervous as shit, i literally almost pissed myself.. cos not only am i going to be performing for people i hardly know, but my mom and lil bro was there. they came unexpected, i had asked my mom if she was coming and she said no so just imagine how i felt seeing her walking in the auditorium.. pretty nerve-wrecking! but it turned out great, i was really more into it than the morning show to be honest! just cos it was night, and i didnt have to worry too much cos performing for these people.. i mean i wont ever hardly see them again! 

and lemme just tell ya, running back and forth trying to change quickly into clothes right after my 1st act with SCOTT and into my 2nd act with Mike n the rest.. is pretty hard shit! lol, gave me quite a little workout ^_^ .. i was sweatin' my balls off though, after i got off stage from doing CC.. but i wasnt stinking! LOL not good to stink, and i dont stink!

well, it's 11:33pm and i am tired as shitake mushrooms! wooo, i'm gonna go to bed! hope all is well with everyone.. laterz!

"event","I guess I oughta start off by telling you all about the sick incident this morning. This man was arguing with his girl on his cellphone. He lived in this apt. building[in Philly, and forgot the name of it] with his girl and there has been complaints about him being such an asshole. So then this morning around 10:30am, he was out on the bacony, talking to his girl, at like the 20+ floor. He was hanging from the side and jumped down to another person's bacony. For some odd reasons, there were cameras around that caught the incident lol.. its like people are being spied on. So anyways, there was a huge fire that broke out in the apt above him and its believed that he started it. He broke into other people's apartments by breaking the glass doors with lounge chairs and tables.. at which he also threw over the bacony. It was just completely insane!! Then he started another fire and jumped to another bacony, which there swat members were and also his girlfriend they said. A swat member was desperately trying to calm him down but the man wouldnt give up.. so he quickly climbed over the bacony.. the swat guy ran as fast as he could to save him.. but without hesitation and much hope, the guy just jumped off and fell 20+ floors down and landed, DEAD, on like this roof thing. 

 It just makes me sick to see how people can be so over-the-top and just end their life like that. I will admit to you all that I have once contemplated suicide as my only way out from this miserable life. Not too long ago, I'd say about a good few years, I was extremely depressed.. I hated myself, I hated others, and I hated life in general. I was rebellious towards my parents and would argue so much with them. As scary and odd as it sounds, I once had a butcher knife to my throat in front of my mom because she got on my nerves. She told me that I was crazy but showed no emotion towards me, though I bet she was petrified by what she had seen. So to make this long story short, I tried cutting myself with a pair of meat cutters but have never succeeded on doing so because by the time I had the cold sharp steel against my skin, I'd break down and sob. Friends tried sticking to me and help me thru my depression but it wasn't successful. Dont get me wrong, I appreciated everything they said and did for me but instead, I helped ME get thru it! I realized that there are lots of things I wanted to accomplished in life and life is soo short and committing suicide wasnt how I wanted to leave the world... I wanted to leave on a positive foot without any bad baggage. 

 So for the people who are depressed, no offense but get over it! I mean, seriously.. is that how you wanna die? Killing yourself and like repeating the same shit over and over in your afterlife. No! We all WANT to die PEACEFULLY and not leave this Earth with the title ""coward"" on our graves for suicide. I'm sure that whatever problem you may have.. there's always a solution to it! I know a person who tried running away from their homes and it's like.. mkay, so what next? Are you gonna spend your whole life living in the streets, eating off people's garbage and sleeping with trash bags and old, pissed-on matress beds? Not to sound so egotistically[might have spelled that wrong lol] but I'm damn glad I got over my personal problems and don't get me wrong, there'll be more probs I'll face as I grow one step older towards my death so I'm not entirely off the hook. These recent days, I've been feeling alot better about myself and just living life like a normal person. I'm 17 f'n years old and I dont want to die young! I learned how to not care of what others think about me because I am who I am and I like who I am and there isn't anyone who can make me change the way I am! WOOOO DAMN RIGHT! LoL

I do not like the assessments, hope I pass 'em. Tomorrow, we have English and Math. The eng. test should be very easy, 80questions and 1 essay.. toughie, yeah? Well, not really..

I've been trying my hardest to not fail math again.. mrs. paone better pass me or else I'd like secretly trash her car with toilet paper and vomit Lol.. bah, not no secret anymore. I'm gonna stop babbling for now and do other more important things.. like SLEEP! Fare thee well.

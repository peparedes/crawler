"event","Wow...I don't even know where to start....other than WARPED TOUR FUCKING KICKED ASS.There aren't words to describe how good it was this year. The best bands by far were The Matches, Underoath, and Anti-Flag. Now I never liked Anti-Flag until I watched some of their proformance this year...THey fucking rocked.The Matches I knew would be good because I had seen them before...But they never put on a boring  show....and Underoath...There are hardly words to describe how beautiful that was. It was raining when they were playing... so everyone was soaking wet...and all their equiptment kept breaking...they played one song without bass because they were trying to fix it lol.Their synth player was fucking sick lol he was so fucking hardcore crazy on that thing lol But I was in front against the gate and the lead singer jumped on it, and i was singing with him while holding him up...it was crazy. So I got great pictures of all my favorite bands...and I came home with a bunch of bruises...but speaking of pictures I met Dro from Deadstar Assembly and he fucking took a picture of us together and caught up with me while I was walking away and  gave me some flyers to hand out..I also got kicked in the ankle with a steel toe boot so thats all bruised up but man was it worth it..lol....
Well, im gunna go do something with my life lol....

"event","Wow, today went slow...I got in some trouble for stupid crap with my mom that I regret doing more than anything now...so that sucks..but thats besides the point. I don't know why, but for some reason, I am feeling really empty inside. It's like thres a hole, and I've tried to fill it with all of this meaningless stupid shit that doesn't work. Ya know those times when you just stare at the sky hoping to realize something ya know...that is what today was like, I find myself sticking my head out my window, with the rain pouring down on my face, looking up for about 10 mins for no apparent reason...and quite frankly...it kinda sucks.I keep telling myself that I am okay, and that I'll be fine, and my decisions are okay, but their not...and I'm not okay...I dunno maybe I just need time to myself...

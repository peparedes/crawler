"event","Well I dont know how many of you know this but I have a big obbsession with a show ''Laguna Beach''(channel 90 on fridays[filmed on an 8month period people,drama,locations are real]),A new show came out ''The Hills''With *drum role please* Lauren from ""LB"" know as LC which is about her new jog working for magazine ""Teen Vouge"" and her ups and downs as a clothing stylist (right up my ally...I know)while in the new episodes 
she gets a call from sleasy Jason (sleeper from LB) who just broke her heart in ""LB"" for jessica (whiney complaing annoying girl who loves Jason)
of course wants to get back together with LC (Jason not Jessica) Lc falls head over heals says yes but to my suprise Jason is alot different in ""The Hills""While Lauren's friend is suffering with her job(fashion school)Lc is having the time of her life.
<i>My opionion<\i>I think he just wanted to get on the show ;)

Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
But clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this
Anymore
Uh
Anymore (anymore)

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And everytime I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer (a murderer)

Right now things are looking up! 2 1/2 days of school left..then summer gym-but I try to forget about that because last year was actually fun so I'm hoping this year is too. Also, I got a puppy last week. He is currently 8 weeks old and adorable. You can see a picture on my picture link on my aim. Also, for those of you that don't know-I got the position of drum major along with Caitlin! I can't wait!! I know that it won't be so great sometimes...well, from what I heard-a lot of the time, but it'll have its moments. Also, I've been able to hang out with Amelia a lot lately which is awesome! She's my girl!!! Haha! And I'm becoming closer with Matt and Brittany which is awesome and I can't wait until the summer starts so everyone can come swim between gym and band! 
Have a great summer!

"event","<FONT color=#666666>I'm in one of those moods were everything seems harder than it should. My easy biology page, probably one of the easiest I have, seemed like the hardest thing. It took me at least a half hour to do it and it was only 11 questions long; 5 of which were fill in the blank. Drum major try outs went great Monday but today they seemed hard. Even though it just the help session its still grueling. I never thought the help sessions would present pressure, I just thought the actual try out would be hard. It's going to seem impossible when the time comes I'm sure, but I'm still going to try my hardest. If I'm not what he's looking for then I guess it's better someone else who&nbsp;has what he is looking for gets it. I know the drum majors are in there to help me but it's hard when I can't do something right and they continue to tell me. Don't get me wrong: I really love it when they tell me, I'd be mad if they didn't! I love that they help and I want to thank all of them for doing so, they are wonderful. It's just that everything I have ever done in the past I understood or was good at the first time I tried it and this is different. I mean, I don't think I'm bad, but for some reason I keep doing the same thing wrong and I can't figure out how to consisently stop doing it. I guess practice makes perfect so I'll have to try that....even so, it's tough. I wish everyone who is trying out the best of luck!<BR>Thanks to all the drum majors again, you guys really do help me a lot!<BR>-Ashley-<BR></FONT>"

I was nervous going into it because I've not camped before and weather issues and stuff but it was awesome. We get there and Kim, Becca, and I set up our tent...by ourselves I may add....and get all situated then we head over to the main stage and check out the bands playing. I've never heard of any of the bands but it was still awesome. Newsboys were the first huge concert with fog and lights at night and everything. Then we went back to the campsite, had hotdogs and hamburgers, then hit the bed. I slept on an air mattress, Becca slept in the middle, and Kim slept halfway on an air mattress ((hers had a hole in it and was only part way inflated)). We got up bright and early in the morning to have breakfast then we just hung around and waited for the teaching session to begin. We listened to this guy talk about relationships and what makes a person ""dateable"". His name was Justin Lookado ((sp?)) and we bought his books today because he was so interesting, frank, and funny! You'll have to borrow them sometime. At night we watched Relient K until they were interrupted by a tornado watch when we all had to return to the campsites and get in our vehicles...cuz that's real safe... We got back to camp and my tent had been taken out by the large white rented tents our ""neighbors"" had. Another one of their tents was stuck to the side of an RV across the way, and another had put a dent in our leaders van. They were horrible winds. Since we had a hole in our tent, we slept in the church van and shivered to death but were still better off than in a windy tent. We got up this morning and decided that since our clothes were all wet, we didn't have any blankets left, we had no food, and we weren't dressed for ice rain that we were going to head home. We packed everything up trying to stay somewhat warm, pushed the vans out of the mud, and headed home. We got home around 2. I'm disappointed we had to leave early, but I was not going to stay out there in that weather for one more day. Before we left, we found out that&nbsp;the weather tracker reported that the storm was increasingly massive&nbsp;and&nbsp;right when it got to the&nbsp;town we were in, the storm split in half and went practically&nbsp;on either side of us so we&nbsp;didn't get nearly the worst.&nbsp;You can't say that some higher&nbsp;power didn't have some doing in that miracle over the Christian&nbsp;concert/camp area!!&nbsp;<BR>When we got home, my aunt was here with her tiny little dog Gunner....he's so adorable! He fits in the palm of your hand practically! We came in and found out that our grandpa was in the hospital with what is luckily pneumonia but they originally thought it was a heart attack. So I shower...first time in a few days-AMAZING! Then we head off to Texas Roadhouse and then over to the hospital. Now I'm so excited to head of to a REAL BED and REAL TOILET! <BR>I just can't wait until next year, some more of you are going to have to come with us!<BR>*Ashley*</FONT></P>"

"event","<FONT color=#ff6666>So yesterday started out kinda slow. Played solitaire on the computer forever again! Then I went to my cousins' first communion. It was the first time I'd been to a Catholic church so it was a little unusual for me. I left his reception at his house early so I could go home....boring! So when I get home Kim and I decide we want something good for dinner so we take some of my brother's money ((we plan to pay him back)) out of his little safe/toy bank thing and go to Chilis. Nic now works there so of course, other than food, that's how we decided on there! He's working finally! Woohoo!! After that we got money from our parents for Jordan then headed to his party. I hung out with Regan and Matt most of the time. We went on a short walk and then layed outside looking at the stars and being retarded. It was a ton of fun though! Today I had church and then we went to Bob Evans. I saw Nick Smiley there, but we didn't really talk, just kinda the ""hi"" and ""bye"" thing...haha. Also, Sami was there so I talked to her and her mom for a little bit about a church camping trip/concert thing. Now I'm just sitting around the house until my grandpa gets here. We're going to the Pacer game then I'll prolly go to youth group if I get I home in time... I don't think the game actually starts until 3:30, so we'll have to wait and see....<BR>I'm off to play solitaire, change for the game, and wait around for him! Have a good week!</FONT>"

"event","So today I picked up a drum major application...The try outs are coming up soon so I'm interested to see how that goes! I'm not so sure my mom or sister want me to try out...The whole thing was hard on Kim and they are trying to ""protect"" me or something. If I don't get it, then I have golf to fall back on so I'm not too worried about it-yet... Not saying I don't want it, trust me, I've wanted it since 7th grade when Kim tried out, but I mean, I'll try not to be too crushed if I don't get it. I love golf and I don't really want to give it up, but I can always play it outside of school, right?! It's not one of those sports where you have to have a team to play. Plus, I don't want to get too worried about it now, I have a while more to think about it. Anyways, I'm sure you'll read more about it later on. I just hope they make the right decision when the time comes!

So this morning I was really tired from getting up and going to Bob Evans and just a lot of stuff went on at once-real weird-but I'm happy now and so it's all okey-dokey. So I went to track, fun stuff let me tell ya. Actually, coach wasn't there and it actually was really fun, as usual. I benched 5 more lbs. than I normally do today, but then I got stuck and couldn't lift it up anymore so I had to stop...woops! But ya, making progress, slowly but surely. I also did leg lifts for the first time and I had 180 on it, so that plus whatever the machine weighs. I actually could have done more on that, but it seemed like too much work to get up and put more weight on it! Yes, I'm lazy, I know! Let's see...what else did I do, oh ya-I did single weights-15 in each hand...not for very long though, after benching my arms were kinda sore (my excuse, and I'm sticking to it). After that I waited on Caitlin to get done so I could go home so as usual I waited in the band room, because there is always at least one person there to talk to! A-Line was getting ready for their practice and so I sat and talked/played piano with Nic then I sat and talked to Evan while we made fun of Nathan playing snare and eating a sub at the same time...funnier than you would think! Then Evan MADE me carry his bass down to the gym which I didn't mind cuz I kinda want to play bass next year anyways. I feel so retarded with it though, and I'm sure I look it! Once again, nothing new! <BR>Ya, tomorrow is state for drumline so I wish them both luck, as should you!!! </FONT></P>"

It's Saturday so usually I go the drumline show but since this week it's really expensive and not worth it, my parents decided not to go and wait until next week. I think next week is state or something anyways so they are gonna wait. Kinda mad though cuz I'm really bored and I wanted to see Nathan tonight cause he's helping world do the dumb props. Anyways, my cell rings at 8:30 this morning and it's Nic-he's like ya me and Nathan wanted to call you and wake you up and tell you we are leaving for drumline now, I was like what the heck, good luck I guess. It was so random! Luckily I got back to sleep within like 30 minutes. When I told Nathan to call me today, I didn't mean have Nic call me and wake me up but whatever...haha, I guess it was a good wake up call...if there is such a thing!

We had a half day today that I spent around the house watching movies, on the phone, and track practice. It's unusual for me to be home so it put me in a really good mood to just be home for once.&nbsp;This week, I like Nathan (Big Byrd-haha...sorry..I'm Little Becker and that's his nickname)....anyways, we have so much fun just talking. He seems really nice and I know other people seem to have different views of him, but he's changed a lot since last year and I really hope all of you can just give him a chance. I don't understand-maybe I will later on, but right now I don't...so just leave me alone! haha! Anyways ya, the problem: he's a junior, and most of you know my mom's rule-bummer! The other day we were ""DISCUSSING""&nbsp;prom!! Which is a possibility and I think the two of us would have a ton of fun even if we go as friends. </FONT><BR>Other than that, this week I've been sick. I didn't say home though...I had a track meet so I couldn't miss practice on the day before and then I obviously had to come the day of the meet. It was at Depauw University at an indoor stadium which was really cool. There were 10 schools there and about 36 shot-put throwers for the girls. I placed 16th, which is in the top half and not bad for a freshman. I was the second place thrower for Avon. <BR><FONT color=#6633ff>Well I hope other people's week is as good as mine!</FONT></FONT>"

I'm now in Garrett's hoodie D/line sweatshirt...It seems like, even though I have two closets full of clothes, I never have anything to wear. So I end up giving up, and wearing a sweatshirt which doesn't make me look very good. Not saying I was trying to look good to go to the drumline show or anything, but its not about that.

I don't know...its hard to explain what I'm trying to say, but my guess is somebody who reads this knows what I'm talking about. <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, I'm gonna go talk to my dad since I haven't seen him in a while then go out to dinner and to the drumline show!

"event","<P><FONT color=#3366ff>So, I was reading this article in People about teens and sex. It got me thinking... So many teens I know continue to have or have had sex. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you are a bad person for doing so, I just don't agree with it. Now what I say in this, you can't get mad at me for, remember, it is MY journal, I can say what I want-it's not directed towards anyone specific either...just us teens in general. So lately I've wanted to kiss, because as many of you know, I never have! (Which if you are laughing right now, grow up!) It was my choice and it still is. I wasn't ready which isn't a bad thing, it means I'll wait even longer before I have sex. In fact, I plan on abstinence, which seems more and more rare these days, but I <EM>have</EM> been taught to be my own person. Lately, I've wanted to kiss <EM>badly </EM>but I'm like everyone else, I'm shy when it comes to that! Ya, I know, me shy, unusual! Anyways, so as I've said I have really been wanting to kiss, but I don't have a boyfriend and I worry that if I kiss someone other than&nbsp;a boyfriend, I'll be considered a ""ho"" or ""slut"". Don't get me wrong, I'm having fun being single, I like to flirt, as many of you can see and I definently don't want a boyfriend just for someone to kiss..thats wrong! I just, I don't know! Not saying I care what other people think, but I don't want people I've never met to have a misconception of me. I am guilty of judging girls based on what they have done with a guy..but not based on what they haven't done. So I'm not saying I'm completely innocent of judgements or names towards other girls. I'm trying hard to stop.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>The article I just read cleared some things up, but confused me in other ways. It was talking about how girls that have done stuff say they were pressured into it. I don't feel like anyone is pressuring me to kiss though. It's a personal choice, as it should be. Which seems odd that I debate about something that seems so small to other teens. Most people, by the time they are 15 have kissed several times and several people along with much more. I'm not ready to go farther than that though, which my parents will be glad to hear-that's for sure! The article was saying how girls feel pressured to do this stuff with guys because other girls do. I don't understand that, almost every girl I have talked to says stuff about other girls that are active, calling them names and looking down on them. But it seems, when they are in the position, they become hypocrites and turn against everything they said. Personally, I go by what I say. I've been close to kissing, more than once, everytime, I turn away. Yeah, makes the guy feel bad, but I don't care...honestly..if I'm not ready, and you can't respect that, then I don't want you. I just think it's sad for the other girls that aren't strong enough to stand by what they say. I mean, yeah, sometimes we make mistakes or irrational decisions, that's fine! Once again, I'm not ragging on anyone, I'm just saying...<BR><BR>Another thing that bothers me, is how bad I want to be kissed. I know it's not a big deal anymore to most teens. Many teens have gone way farther than that and probably think I'm just being a baby because I haven't kissed. Some try to make me feel beneath them because I haven't. Explain that one to me too....we look down on those who are active, and we make fun of those who haven't even kissed....seems a little messed up to me! But as I think I've said, if you don't like what I'm saying, you don't have to read this. I just have a strong belief in abstinence which many people I've met over the course of the year, seem not to. That's their own choice, I can't stop them, I just hope they know what they are getting themselves into to. <BR><BR>Also, I read in the article that&nbsp;they have this nation wide Silver Ring Thing where teens wear a silver band on their left hand to represent abstinence. I plan to get a silver ring, even though it's not an official one (You have to attend a convention thing&nbsp;to get one, and they don't come to IN).&nbsp;Feel free to do so yourself-maybe we can get it going here too! <BR></FONT><FONT color=#3366ff><BR>Anyways, this is long so I'm going to stop boring you, but if you have ANY comments on this, even bad ones, feel free to leave them! I want to hear everyone's opinion.... </FONT></P>"

I don't really have any ""love"" right now but I mean there's always gonna be Nick! Winter Ball is in two weeks but my guess is I'll end up going by myself...bummer! My golf lessons start next Wednesday also, that could be interesting because I haven't played since the end of the season which probably wasn't a very good idea...my bad! I also finished driver's ed with an A+ so you don't have to worry about my driving! I even have my own memory setting in the Saab! How fun is that?! I'm going to learn how to play guitar soon also-possibly as early as Sunday so that should be fun!<BR>Well I'm gonna go continue to be bored-I'll right back in a few more months...hehe!</FONT></P>"

"event","So it's definently been FOREVER since I last wrote something on here. Marching season is completely over! Ya know, so far I don't miss it, but that could change. I actually have pep band now..bummer. First game is tomorrow. I'm in the festival band-for those of you that don't know-that's the LOWEST band you can be in! It's made up of the leftover saxes, trumpets, and flutes. So really it's not even a full band. We don't even get to perform by ourselves because of our instrumentation suckiness. Ya, Donna and I are the only first part altos in there..we really don't understand how we're there-neither does Karl and Harloff knows I hate it! I make sure he knows ahaha! 
     
      I could have gotten my permit today too! It's finally three weeks before my class. I'm taking it with Sara so hopefully it won't be quite as bad with her than by myself. 
     
      Also, we got our class rings but of course that has to go wrong too-it's too big. so I'm sending that back on Thursday when we order our state championship rings!

     I got my letter jacket a couple weeks ago too! Wohoo! That's always fun! Now everyone stopped listening to me saying I get my jacket in ? days! 

      I did my Christmas shopping this weekend! Got Kim part of hers, I'm making my mom pick up the other part though, that way at least some of it is a surprise. I got her a pearl belt from target that I had her try on! lol! That's ok, because I did that-she told me what she got me for christmas-a manicure! I've been wanting one since my first one before I went on spring break last year. Which, if I think about it, no one got to see it cuz I got it done the weekend before I left for San Fran! Oh well, they'll get to see it this time! We're getting my mom a silver cross necklace, I got my dad an alarm clock cuz I decided his is too old fashioned! And I got my brother the coolest golf club head cover thats a monkey with a plaid hat on and a divet repair-not that any of you know what either of those are! I didn't get any of my friends anything, sorry-no money!

      This Friday is our church lock-in! Brittany and Sam and Amanda are all gonna be there so it should be tons of giggles! Nick might come too because he's my bestest friend in the whole wide world! We'll see if his parents let him, which they should cuz guys and girls sleep separately, at least I think-or at least that's what his mom's gonna think! Hehe! Nah, we're not like that, we just talk like that cuz its funny! Plus he's with Alice!"

Half the time I'm never at golf and band the entire time!! I'm so busy I never have time to eat and sleep cuz the time that I am home, I am showering! That's good to know though! I of course have my ""flavor of the week"" as everyone know calls it! Actually, I have two, but I have liked both of them for a long time! One of them knows it and he knows I like the other guy too cuz its his pretty close friend. Nick, the one that knows, is going to ask Alice out though so I'm&nbsp;kinda out of the picture right now. I also have a problem with the other guy...he's over one year older than me! He's really sweet though and no one has anything against him that I know of! I'll live though! I just think that rule is really retarded...not all guys are the same...just most of them! I'm always told how much more mature I am than the people my age ((when I wanna be)) but when it comes time to dating, I'm not mature enough! What's that all about! I'm attracted to the older guys because they are more mature! That's all! Whatever...I'll get over it eventually!</FONT></P>"

I placed third on our team in one meat and second on our team in the second one. Today is the county tournament but since I messed up at practice ((big time)) I'm not playing today which sadly is okay with me because I really needed a break from everything. Band is going good. The three hour practices seem really short after having all the all day ones. I saw a Cinderella Story last week with Sami. If you haven't seen it yet, you definently need to. I'm looking forward to seeing The Little Black Book which I hope to see tonight. Tomorrow is my dad's birthday and since I wasn't home to do the shopping, I have to make the cake today. I got my hair cut yesterday after golf practice. It looks about the same but without the dry split ends which most of you haven't seen because I haven't been around you. Today I really want to go shopping to get some heeled flip flops. I've been wanting them for a while but I haven't had time to go buy them! Sad, huh? Just kidding!

That was cool! On Friday I had to leave in the morning and go to golf practice. There's only 7 of us that showed up so we are automatically on the team so that's cool! One of the girls is out of town so she won't be here for the meet on Monday which gives me a better chance of getting to go to the meet on Monday! Fun stuff! Yesterday at practice it was rainy and I was already worn out from band but I ended up playing ok. I beat both of the girls I was playing with! We only played five holes though. I had to leave to get back to band, Maribeth had to go somewhere, and Sami had a doctor's appointment so we all left. Coach Drabyn didn't care because that was the original time he said we'd be leaving. When I got back to band we practiced the music inside because it was raining and it tears up the instruments. We had the performance for our parents on Friday too but since it was raining we had to just stand in the gym and play the music instead of getting to march. That wasn't all that great. Afterwards there was a carnival thing. I didn't do any of it but it was still fun because I watched Carolina Crown ((it's a drum corp which is a really really good marching band)) practice. After that Garrett and I went over to the St. Susanna festival because our friend works there. You should go! It's pretty fun! There's a mechanical bull, a rock wall, the bungee run like at finale, an obstical course like at finale and a ton of other stuff. It's pretty cool! If you're bored go! Today I have golf practice again at like 2. Afterwards I might go see A Cinderella story cuz I've been dying to see it! Well I've written a lot so I'll write back some other time!</STRONG></FONT></P>"

We are learning it this coming week at band camp in Avon...it's gonna suck! One night we had a talent show, the senior skit wasn't all that great. Garrett and Joey did the best job by far. Ours was gay, we did I'm a little tea pot but who really cares! The last night was cross-dressing day! Nick and Joey make very sexy girls.... I was Nick's&nbsp;""pimp""!

In fact my mom said my turns were better than my sister's were for like the first month! It's so much fun though! At first I didn't realize how touchy the pedals were. It took a little while to get used to but after that I was fine, for the most part. I like using the turn signal for some reason. I don't really know why! I tried to pull into a parking spot and the first time I did it almost perfect but after that I couldn't do it again! I couldn't get exactly in the center, I was always closer to one side. One thing I really never did right was back out of a spot. It's hard to tell when there aren't other cars around to tell whether you would be hitting someone else or not. It was fun trying though! My sister drove us back to the neighborhood then I drove through the neighborhood home. Instead of turning right onto my street we went all the way around the circle and down the court where Lindsey lives. We passed Lindsey but they weren't paying attention and didn't realize it was me! I got to go in two col-di-sacs and did pretty good in those! I even pulled into the garage! I was just going to pull up onto the drive way but my mom&nbsp;decided that since my dad wasn't home I had the entire garage to try to get into so I just pulled into the middle! It was really fun! I can't wait to drive again! My mom said once I drive a little more in my sister's car that I can try the Trailblazer but it's obviously a lot different to drive! I can't wait! I was getting ready to outside and spray paint my stuff for my room but my mom said to wait until this weekend when we have more time so that we have enough time to sand and everything and then let it dry all day! I have band tonight of course! I get to see Nick! I need to have a ""talk"" with Evan though! Last night at like 1 in the morning he got on Anthony's sn and called me ""sweet thang"". It was hilarious! I need to find out what that was all about! It was funny though! I saw it when I got up this morning! I can't wait until I get to drive again! It's so much fun! Tomorrow my sister and I are taking Robin shopping for band camp stuff. I mean we need to go too, but her mom thought Robin ought to go with the two of us sometime and since we have to go anyways for band, we might as well bring her. Especially because as a freshman you have no idea what you need and my sister does! I'm gonna go rest for now and watch Oprah! It looks really good today! </FONT></STRONG>"

Monday, I went to the doctors for an athletic physical. Wasn't bad! Had to get a tetnis ((however you spell it)) shot! That wasn't bad though. It seems to hurt a lot worse when you're little! After that I got Olive Garden! Which, if you read the last journal I was really wanting! Last night my mom went and picked up our new Trailblazer and got rid of the mini-van!! I haven't riden in it yet but I will on the way to the dentist's today. It's kinda like the check up week for me!! I'm going to get a cleaning. I've only had cavities once, last time, so hopefully I won't have any. I think I will though because last time they said I had five....2 were completely below the surface and were only detected because they got a new machine that supposedly reads where there is a cavity...bull crap! So they&nbsp;left them alone!&nbsp;But if it really works, it's been a year since the last time I was in there, so there probably is a cavity there by now. Which really sucks! Up until last visit I hadn't had any!! Also, I like Evan as just a friend now. Some of you will be happy to hear that, others could care less. I moved on to someone that is probably better ""boyfriend material"". He gets along with <EM>everybody</EM> and he's a sophomore which means I'm allowed to date him! Yay!

On hole 8 it starts pooring down rain so we wait in the cart until it stops and continue on. When we get to hole 15 we see lightening and hear thunder really close so we decide we should pick up on that hole and head on in. As so as we get in the cart, like no joke, it starts pooring down hail and rain. It stung so bad! Of course we were on one of the farthest holes from the clubhouse too! I was drenched. So we head to the car and throw our bags in the trunk and I decide since I'm already wet I might as well go ahead and put the cart up now. When I get out of the cart I had my flip-flops on because I had already changed, my shoe gets stuck in the mud so I turn around and pick it up. I start walking away with the one in my hand so of course the other one comes off. I just picked them both up and ran out of the rain. It was hysterical! Of course there was a group standing right under the shelter of the garage so they all saw me and had to laugh too! <BR><FONT color=#99ff99>After that excitement I lay everything out to dry in the garage and my clothes in the bathroom and head for the shower! I get all cleaned up and go over to Robin's house to spend the night. Right after she picked me up we headed straight to the movie theater where we saw Spiderman 2! It was pretty cool, if you haven't seen it yet, you ought to! Make sure you've seen the first one though, otherwise, you will be completely confused! When we got home we watched some movie that was about a beauty contest ((not miss congeniality)) I'm not sure what it was called. It was..uhh..intersting...after that we watched some of the 5th Wheel. Once we got bored of that-didn't take long-we watched reruns of the Simple Life that she had taped. It was pretty funny! Those two are hilarious! We went to sleep around 3:30! We got up around 10:30 and had doughnuts for breakfast and played the ps2. It was some Simpson's car game. It was pretty fun! I only one once out of like 20 times though! When I got home I watched Finding Nemo and drew cartoon people! Fun stuff huh? Oh and what I thought was kinda funny was that Robin's mom thinks I look like Hilary Duff! She says the two of us have the same kinda ""little blonde girl"" face! I guess it's a good thing! Too bad I'm not as skinny as her! Well I'm gonna go for now! Hopefully I get to go out for dinner because I haven't eaten out at a decent restaurant in a long time and I really want Olive Garden!

Today I ran it in 4:36. I think what made the difference of yesterday and today was that yesterday I sprinted up to my house and today I just jogged all the way up into the garage. So I think that was what made most of the difference because I kinda felt like I was running faster today. I was curious today so I decided to wear my mom's pedometer while I ran. It turned out its .52 miles which is about what I thought it was. I knew it had to be about half a mile! I think running makes you feel better because I'm actually happier now than I was before I ran! But I will only run at night because it's too hot during the day and there is no way I am getting up that early! That's about all I've done productive today though. The rest of the day I just sat around on the couch. I was all cleaned up though! I had on a new shirt and a pair of capris and my hair was scrunched, I just had no where to go! Tomorrow, I'm spending the night at Robin's house though! That should be a blast! We are going to the rec. center and then we might rent a movie! Fun stuff! Since I'm at her house I doubt I'll go for a run but we probably will go on a walk because that seems like a common thing I always do when I'm at someone's house. Don't know why, we just always seem to end up walking! Well todaloo and ta-ta for now!

So if it says 16:00 I always change it to say 4. I just realized about five minutes ago that when I do that, it sets the time to A.M.! Now who would have thought the computer would be that smart!? To help prove the expression, yesterday I learned in order for the Maurice's ten dollar off card to actually work, you have to spend $250 in that store! Now, if you've ever been in there you know that it's not hard to do with prices like that, but come on people, at least only make it $100! <BR>Today I think I managed to set a record. I layed on the couch in the same spot for three hours. Now only about 10 minutes out of the three hours I was asleep. Now, that's pretty impressive! Yeah, in case you haven't figured out my day has pretty much s-u-c-k-e-d! I got up around ten and after breakfast I went to lay out. It was kinda chilly out for a swimsuit and water so I stayed out of about 50 minutes then came back inside. I had lunch then layed on the couch the rest of the day. I'm kinda bored! I kinda really miss Evan too! If anyone wants to take me out to a movie I'd love to go! Please! Anyone! But not a chick-flick cuz I'll miss Evan more! </FONT>"

I remembered I had put some&nbsp;money in the bank a while ago so I&nbsp;took&nbsp;some of it out finally to spend on some clothes!&nbsp;I bought a lot of stuff though! At Target I had a gift-card for $25 dollars so I kinda bought everything I wanted there. I bought a new top coat of nail polish which I just put on and is the wrong color! I also bought really cute new purse. I finally got myself a new wallet. I've had the other once since I was about 6 or 7 literally! I got a really cute purple striped shirt that I can wear to church with my black skirt I bought a few weeks ago. Then at Kohl's I bought a really comfy pair of pajama capri panst there were like %70 off! I also got some underwear that says Princess on it because that was my nickname during summer gym according to Evan because one day I was complaining about something so he just started calling me that! I saw them and just had to get them. At Old Navy I bought a 3/4 sleeve hot pink shirt and a yellow t-shirt. At our last store, Maurices, I bought this adorable white skirt with black lace and flowers on it for half off! After our shopping we went across to BW3's! My sister and I split 6 wings and a small fry with a drink! I only had two dollars left so that's all i could chip in! Tonight I might be going to see Spiderman 2 with Aryn but I'm not exactly sure yet. I still have to ask and attempt to get a ride! I have a feeling we won't be going though! Sorry Babe!</FONT></P>"

"event","<FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Well, sadly I ended up being right.&nbsp;A few days ago I said I was worried Evan would back out of coming to Hummel with me. He did...It's not his fault though. At the last minute his parents decided he had to go with them downtown to watch the fireworks there. They were even making his 20 yr. old brother come along. I was so mad! I told him I'd be at his house around 7 and that I'd call him a little before to find out where his house is. Well, he called me a few minutes after 7, so I was assuming he was calling to give me directions or whatever. I was wrong! He called to tell me he couldn't come. I&nbsp;told him if&nbsp;he got&nbsp;home in time maybe you can still come back to our house and set off fireworks. So when I got home, I called him up to see if he was home yet or what the deal was. He was already home, he said he had just walked in. So that was like perfect timing. I asked about him coming over but he said he talked to his parents on the way home about it and they said he couldn't because he can't go out after ten unless he was already out with the person. So like if he were to go to the fireworks with me, he would have been able to be there until midnight when we finished our fireworks. So I talked to him on the phone for a little while so that kinda made up for a little bit. I was so mad/sad though! I was really looking forward to hanging out with him! The fireworks we set off were awesome! We had some called ""Mad Bombers"" they were like actual fireworks that shot 100+ feet in the air. They were awesome! We ended up using an entire lighter stick, which is what ur parents probably use to light candles, and an entire lighter that you like light cigarrettes with. We ended up using matches but they didn't work very well because they wouldn't stay lit as well. So we ended up going in at midnight with some left over fireworks. In fact, I think we are going out today and buying some more since they will all be really cheap! My sister and I have found out that neither of us would ever be able to smoke cuz we have so much trouble trying to start the lighter! Anyways, we ended up shooting&nbsp;a few rockets onto the neighbors roof, but we're sorry! I'm gonna go eat some blueberry muffins now! </FONT>"

After church we went out to lunch, bringing Garrett along. We ate at Bob </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>Evans and I got the chicken fingers-haha! They were actually pretty good! After we got home we decided we were going to go get our own fireworks. See, my sister and </FONT><FONT color=#3366ff>Garrett both have to work tonight. Garrett gets off at 8:30, which gives him enough time to get to Hummel Park. The problem is my sister, she doesn't know when she </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>can get off. So there is a pretty good chance the two of them won't end up at hummel park in time. So, we bought our own fireworks. We are going to set them off at our <FONT color=#3366ff>house once everyone gets home. We bought $40 worth of fireworks so it should be pretty good. Kim and I have never set off fireworks so we had no idea what we were</FONT> looking for, we just told Garrett to pick out pretty ones! Hopefully, he listened, we'll find out later I guess. As I've said before, Evan is coming to Hummel Park with us! I <FONT color=#3366ff>feel kinda bad though because I don't know exactly when we are leaving so I couldn't really give him a time. I just told him around 7. Hopefully I'm right. I told him after </FONT>the park we are coming back to my house to set off our own fireworks. I think he's looking forward to that. This should be really interesting. We've never done fireworks at our house before! Usually his parents don't </FONT><FONT color=#3366ff>really care what time he gets home as long as its before like 3 am. (exagerating) so hopefully we can just hang out here a while! It should be fun! I'm looking forward to some fun! I have <FONT color=#ff0000>heard that a lot of people are going to Hummel Park tonight. I think Aryn, Shelby, and Rachel are. I know Nate and Nicole are. Since Evan knows Nate, we will probably </FONT>hang out with them. Also, Christy is going with her step-sister and family. I have only been to Hummel Park's fireworks once-or maybe twice, I can't really remember. Last year we </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>watched the fireworks in Chicago outside our hotel we could see them! I'm really excited about having our own fireworks. I hope you have a great 4th of July too!</FONT></FONT>"

I'm getting there-by the end of the season I'll probably beat him everytime. Well, I hope! Part of the reason I did so bad was because the people in front of us were really slow! It's hard to play good when you have to wait like ten minutes between every shot. My little brother came. It was the first time he had been on a course better than Hendricks County. That also slowed the game down, if you know what I mean! <BR>Also, today was my last day of summer gym. I really should be happy, but I'm kinda sad. I had so much fun hanging with Nick, Evan, Ben, Ashley, Lauren, and Stephanie! I'll still see Nick, Evan, Ben, and Stephanie at band-but its just not the same! I'm really gonna miss Evan!! Haha, I was looking through his wallet and his school ID was in there. I was like omg you look so hott in that picture. I just kept looking at it and saying how hot he looked. It was hilarious. He ended up letting me keep it! So I know have a really really hot picture of Evan!! Yay! I'm kinda jealous at the moment though. I just realized tonight is the night he is going to the party of the girl he likes. The one he's allowed to date! O well, I'm really gonna have to get over it! It just sucks though!

He thought the guy was seriously making him eat his spaghetti. Lauren and I were just dying laughing because we could see he was kidding. So that was like the highlight of Fazoli's. Oh ya, there were also like 50 little kids that came in to eat from some day camp. I've never seen a camp that took them out to lunch! But anyways-it was hilarious because we were at one of the booths next to the line to get your food and so Ben kept talking to the little kids while they waited. So, as you know I went shoe shopping! I couldn't get the Nike Shox I wanted just yet because I was supposed to get semi-cheap shoes for marching band and then I can get those for school. I got white ones that have red on them. I think they are the same ones Roxie, the girl tuba player, has. They are really cool. Then we went over to Old Navy and I got a flag tank-top and a hot&nbsp;pink tank-top for band camp.

Then Ben asked for a box and the guy told him no because he ate so many breadsticks that he should have to eat all his spaghetti. So then he comes by again when Lauren wasn't there and didn't even look at Ben, he just said-in a really weird voice-eat ur spaghetti. Of course I was taking a drink so I sprayed it everywhere!

They were really good, people would have liked to read them so I'll re-type them as best I can. <BR><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Two days of summer gym left. Really three, but since I haven't missed a day yet, I'm skipping Friday-because I can. I'm kinda sad though, I'll miss goofing off with Evan. Its so much fun because when we get out there to play tennis or whatever, he is completely himself because he's with a bunch of freshmen he doesn't know and doesn't care what they think. He is always trying to make me smile. He does a really good job at it too! I've had people come up to me and tell me how cute we look together, but the thing is-I don't get it. What does it mean you look cute together? Does it mean you guys are both fat so you look physically good together? Does it mean you two have personalities that just fit together? Does it mean you people are both hated, so you would go great together? I mean, really, there are so many different things they could mean! I think its that he can always make me smile and I think I'm getting better at knowing what makes him smile. I think that when I smile, he smiles because he knows he made me happy. He knows I like him so he's not trying to impress me or anyone else, he's just himself! It's so much fun, I'm really gonna miss him! <BR>Luckily, tomorrow, I get to go to Fazoli's with ""the group""-Ben, Evan, Nick, Lauren, and Ashley-I'm kinda like the ""newest member"" you could say. They go somewhere like every week but since a teenager drives and I'm not allowed to ride with teenagers, I usually just don't bother asking. But since it's kinda to celebrate our last day of gym, I went ahead and asked my mom. I was gonna have my sister take me and come too I guess because she knows the people, but she has a doctor's appointment. So, my grandma is watching my brother, so I called her up and she is gonna pick me up and take me over there! Yay! I'm kinda excited! It should be fun!

I beat him the second game thank you very much. Bowled a 109! That's good for me! I had Nick talk to Evan for me and see whether or not Evan likes me. Apparently he does but since I'm not allowed to date him he kinda gave up and he is gonna just go for a different girl instead. Very sad! I still have a little chance..I hope! Anyways, when I got home we convinced my sister to take me and my brother golfing. The main reason she actually went was because my parents bribed her with Grey's Cafeteria for dinner. She loves their Coconut cream pie. Food will pretty much get her to go anywhere! Well we get there, and for the first time, they didnt' let me drive a golf cart so we had three people in one golf-cart. That was entertaining in itself. Not to mention my sister isn't what you would call a golfer and it was only the second time my brother had been on&nbsp;a course! So they would cheat and go about 200 yards up on the long holes that were like 400+ yards. They didn't do too bad..my brother shot a 67 and my sister shot a 71....one hole-it took her 12! For those of you that don't golf, the average golfer shoots about 5 or 6 on a hole like that! Anyways, I ended up with a 47 which wasn't too bad for my second time out this season. My grandpa is taking me and my brother out on Thursday to Twin Bridges again. Hopefully, I can beat my last game's score! Well I'm going to dinner, so I'll write back later!</FONT></EM></P>"

First my inernet was out for about two days then my dad fixes it and the same day my mom told me I wasn't allowed to get on until I got all my ""work"" done! I had to clean my room, clean out my closet-which if you've never seen it, was stacked about 4 feet into the air of just junk and when you opened it, it all came out, and it took me five trash bags to empty it. Then I had to pull like 1/4 of the weeds in our yard. I finally finished all that about 30 minutes ago! Ya it was funny because I picked up my room and as soon as I got done I started on my closet. So I like empty it out into different piles on the floor on my bed, just everywhere! I start not feeling well so I go lay down in the bonus room an watch Montel until 3 when I had to get up again for band. So I only got to rest for about 20 minutes. Even though I dreaded going, band practice was the best it has been so far! I finally got to play with the entire hornline and not just the woodwinds. I found out that at the moment, I am playing first part sax. I even beat out an upperclassmen which is pretty cool. Also not only was it really cool when we played ""Old Hundredth""-for those of you not in band, don't worry about it- and every party just fit. It was just cool! Then we went over and learned five pages of drill! That was fun now! I still never got all my movements exactly right, but I'm getting there! Ok, so after band I come home to my room which is just <EM>destroyed</EM> from cleaning so I end up sleeping in the bonus room. That wasn't as comfortable as I would have hoped, but at least I slept somewhat well. I got up, made sausage gravy and biscuits and finished cleaning....talk about fun times!</FONT></STRONG>"

Then I heard her turn it off and since I was asleep on the bed, I moved to the floor to sleep until 8 when I got up. Now, eight hours seems like a lot! But really it wasn't enough. Band really wears me out! I had a diet coke on the way to her house and when I got there I had a Pepsi. I was trying to get some caffiene, but obviously it wasn't strong enough!

See Karl, the saxophone instructor, is with his band in California. He's pretty tough when it comes to practicing, etc. The guy we had last night is a brass instructor so doesn't know enough about the sax. to tell us what to do about it. It's awesome. Yesterday, he ran out of things for us to do, so he let us leave ten minutes early. Hopefully, he will do the same tonight.

Well I'm gonna go! </FONT></EM></STRONG>"

Obama's Use of Complete Sentences Stirs Controversy:


In the first two weeks since the election, President-elect Barack Obama has broken with a tradition established over the past eight years through his controversial use of complete sentences, political observers say.

Millions of Americans who watched Mr. Obama's appearance on CBS's 60 Minutes on Sunday witnessed the president-elect's unorthodox verbal tic, which had Mr. Obama employing grammatically correct sentences virtually every time he opened his mouth.

But Mr. Obama's decision to use complete sentences in his public pronouncements carries with it certain risks, since after the last eight years many Americans may find his odd speaking style jarring.

According to presidential historian Davis Logsdon of the University of Minnesota, some Americans might find it ""alienating"" to have a president who speaks English as if it were his first language.

""Every time Obama opens his mouth, his subjects and verbs are in agreement,"" says Mr. Logsdon. ""If he keeps it up, he is running the risk of sounding like an elitist.""

The historian said that if Mr. Obama insists on using complete sentences in his speeches, the public may find itself saying, ""Okay, subject, predicate, subject predicate -- we get it, stop showing off.""

The president-elect's stubborn insistence on using complete sentences has already attracted a rebuke from one of his harshest critics, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska.

""Talking with complete sentences there and also too talking in a way that ordinary Americans like Joe the Plumber and Tito the Builder can't really do there, I think needing to do that isn't tapping into what Americans are needing also,"" she said.

Also, I wonder if Janna's seeing the slight resemblance between him and Jim Morrison. There's this one scene in 10 Things where Heath is walking into a bar from behind and you just see Jim Morrison...seriously, I remember seeing it and then Janna saying the same thing.

After being alerted to a possible election law violation, he (Stephen Colbert) and the network dropped plans to post signature forms on Comedy Central's Web site, and instead created a bare-bones Web site for official campaign activity, www.colbert08.org.
On Thursday's program, he held up what he said was a letter from a Washington election lawyer, and made the legal framework part of his schtick.


""In accepting corporate money, I promise to respect federal election laws the same way I respect the must-shower-before-swimming law at the Y,"" Colbert said. ""As a candidate, I am under no obligation to promote the zesty, robust taste of Doritos brand tortilla chips, regardless of how great a snack they may be for lunchtime, munch time, anytime.""

He also said that, because of election laws, Doritos would technically be sponsoring not his candidacy but his program's coverage of his candidacy.

""It's illegal for my crunch money here to pay for the campaign, but it is legal for it to pay for my show, and the show can report on my campaign,"" he said. ""Host: 'Eat them.' Candidate: 'I just happen to like 'em.' ""

But even if Doritos has found a way around the ban on corporate donations, that doesn't address the issue of Comedy Central's promotion of a candidacy.

Noble said it would pretty clearly violate the law for the owner of a cable station to decide to give a talk show -- or otherwise hand over editorial control of a program -- to a favored candidate.

Comedy Central representatives did not return calls seeking comment."

"event","TOKYO, Japan (AP) -- Japan's abhorrent practice of enslaving women to provide sex for its troops in World War II has a little-known sequel: After its surrender -- with tacit approval from the U.S. occupation authorities -- Japan set up a similar ""comfort women"" system for American GIs.

An Associated Press review of historical documents and records shows American authorities permitted the official brothel system to operate despite internal reports that women were being coerced into prostitution. The Americans also had full knowledge by then of Japan's atrocious treatment of women in countries across Asia that it conquered during the war.

Tens of thousands of women were employed to provide cheap sex to U.S. troops until the spring of 1946, when Gen. Douglas MacArthur shut the brothels down.

The documents show the brothels were rushed into operation as American forces poured into Japan beginning in August 1945.

""Sadly, we police had to set up sexual comfort stations for the occupation troops,"" recounts the official history of the Ibaraki Prefectural Police Department, whose jurisdiction is just northeast of Tokyo. ""The strategy was, through the special work of experienced women, to create a breakwater to protect regular women and girls.""

The orders from the Ministry of the Interior came on August 18, 1945, one day before a Japanese delegation flew to the Philippines to negotiate the terms of their country's surrender and occupation.

The Ibaraki police immediately set to work. The only suitable facility was a dormitory for single police officers, which they quickly converted into a brothel. Bedding from the navy was brought in, along with 20 comfort women. The brothel opened for business September 20.

Brothel was 'elbow to elbow'

""As expected, after it opened it was elbow to elbow,"" the history says. ""The comfort women ... had some resistance to selling themselves to men who just yesterday were the enemy, and because of differences in language and race, there were a great deal of apprehensions at first. But they were paid highly, and they gradually came to accept their work peacefully.""

Police officials and Tokyo businessmen established a network of brothels under the auspices of the Recreation and Amusement Association, which operated with government funds. On August 28, 1945, an advance wave of occupation troops arrived in Atsugi, just south of Tokyo. By nightfall, the troops found the RAA's first brothel.

""I rushed there with two or three RAA executives, and was surprised to see 500 or 600 soldiers standing in line on the street,"" Seiichi Kaburagi, the chief of public relations for the RAA, wrote in a 1972 memoir. He said American MPs were barely able to keep the troops under control.

Though arranged and supervised by the police and civilian government, the system mirrored the comfort stations established by the Japanese military abroad during the war.

Kaburagi wrote that occupation GIs paid upfront and were given tickets and condoms. The first RAA brothel, called Komachien -- The Babe Garden -- had 38 women, but due to high demand that was quickly increased to 100. Each woman serviced from 15 to 60 clients a day.

American historian John Dower, in his book ""Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of WWII,"" says the charge for a short session with a prostitute was 15 yen, or about a dollar, roughly the cost of half a pack of cigarettes.

Kaburagi said the sudden demand forced brothel operators to advertise for women who were not licensed prostitutes.

Natsue Takita, a 19-year-old Komachien worker whose relatives had been killed in the war, responded to an ad seeking an office worker. She was told the only positions available were for comfort women and was persuaded to accept the offer.

According to Kaburagi's memoirs, Takita jumped in front of a train a few days after the brothel started operations.

""The worst victims ... were the women who, with no previous experience, answered the ads calling for `Women of the New Japan,""' he wrote.

By the end of 1945, about 350,000 U.S. troops were occupying Japan. At its peak, Kaburagi wrote, the RAA employed 70,000 prostitutes to serve them. Although there are suspicions, there is not clear evidence non-Japanese comfort women were imported to Japan as part of the program.

Toshiyuki Tanaka, a history professor at the Hiroshima Peace Institute, cautioned that Kaburagi's number is hard to document. But he added the RAA was also only part of the picture -- the number of private brothels outside the official system was likely even higher.

The U.S. occupation leadership provided the Japanese government with penicillin for comfort women servicing occupation troops, established prophylactic stations near the RAA brothels and, initially, condoned the troops' use of them, according to documents discovered by Tanaka.

Occupation leaders were not blind to the similarities between the comfort women procured by Japan for its own troops and those it recruited for the GIs.

A December 6, 1945, memorandum from Lt. Col. Hugh McDonald, a senior officer with the Public Health and Welfare Division of the occupation's General Headquarters, shows U.S. occupation forces were aware the Japanese comfort women were often coerced.

""The girl is impressed into contracting by the desperate financial straits of her parents and their urging, occasionally supplemented by her willingness to make such a sacrifice to help her family,"" he wrote. ""It is the belief of our informants, however, that in urban districts the practice of enslaving girls, while much less prevalent than in the past, still exists.""

The RAA collapses

Amid complaints from military chaplains and concerns that disclosure of the brothels would embarrass the occupation forces back in the United States, on March 25, 1946, MacArthur placed all brothels, comfort stations and other places of prostitution off limits. The RAA soon collapsed.

MacArthur's primary concern was not only a moral one.

By that time, Tanaka says, more than a quarter of all American GIs in the occupation forces had a sexually transmitted disease.

""The nationwide off-limits policy suddenly put more than 150,000 Japanese women out of a job,"" Tanaka wrote in a 2002 book on sexual slavery. Most continued to serve the troops illegally. Many had VD and were destitute, he wrote.

Under intense pressure, Japan's government apologized in 1993 for its role in running brothels around Asia and coercing women into serving its troops. The issue remains controversial today.

In January, California Rep. Mike Honda offered a resolution in the House condemning Japan's use of sex slaves, in part to renew pressure on Japan ahead of the closure of the Asian Women's Fund, a private foundation created two years after the apology to compensate comfort women.

The fund compensated only 285 women in the Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan, out of an estimated 50,000 to 200,000 comfort women enslaved by Japan's military in those countries during the war. Each received 2 million yen, about $17,800. A handful of Dutch and Indonesian women were also given assistance.

The fund closed, as scheduled, on March 31.

Haruki Wada, the fund's executive director, said its creation marked an important change in attitude among Japan's leadership and represented the will of Japan's ""silent majority"" to see that justice is done. He also noted that although it was a private organization, the government was its main sponsor, kicking in 4.625 billion yen, about $40 million.

Even so, he admitted it fell short of expectations.

""The vast majority of the women did not come forward,"" he said.

As a step toward acknowledging and resolving the exploitation of Japanese women, however, it was a complete failure.

Though they were free to do so, no Japanese women sought compensation.

""Not one Japanese woman has come forward to seek compensation or an apology,"" Wada said. ""Unless they feel they can say they were completely forced against their will, they feel they cannot come forward.""

Thinking about her response and about when I met her, she really doesn't seem like the type of person who would lie about something like that.  She ave me the name of Annie's vet, so I'm going to head over there tomorrow and I should be able to get the facts and perhaps some answers.  Of course...it may mean a vet's visit, which means money...but if I don't have her with me...hum...thinking outloud here.  Anywho, that's that.

Oh, and this morning the black cat returned, even though the window was closed.  He's taken up marking his territory on my window...:-P  Annie had a *hit fit and hissed like a mad woman at him.  Which was great.  I've never heard her hiss before."

But, as it turns out, that with the coming out of spring, so has the truth.  Annie is most definitely NOT been fixed.  Last week she was unusually interested in my suitcase, which was laying on the floor.  Then, last night, I opened up the window a crack, and within 1/2 an hour there was a black cat clawing at my screen.  It scared a away pretty quickly once I figured out it wasn't Annie at the screen. She gave a few mournful cries at his disappearance and lingered around the window for about a 1/2 hour.  This morning, I left the window open again, and with in an hour or so, the same cat returned.  Ugh, so now I'm pissed because this girl outright lied to me.  So now, not only has she not been fixed, but that also leaves the question as to whether or not she even got any shots.  I've emailed Anna, requesting a record of her shots and the name of the ""supposed"" vet that she used.  I didn't mention anything about Annie being in heat...I need to see if there are even any records of vaccinations before I go there."

Last weekend I headed to Mass to do my taxes and then Jenn & I had a double date with Chris and Zach.  Sooo much fun. Zach and I made dinner, (He made salmon, and I made the side dishes) and the four of us had dinner together, then headed to the Villa Rose for drinks.  I got pretty drunk, more than I had anticipated, but that's all good.  

I thought this weekend would be slow, but last night, Dora, an old friend from B-Town, called because she was in town and wanted to know if I wanted to hang out.  So I hung out with her and her 4 gay guy friends for the evening before heading down to a gay bar in town.  Again...sooo much fun.  Then this evening, Tabitha and her fiance and I (they lived in B-town for two years before they moved here in August) went to Bull Feeney's for food and snacks.  They're nice people, we have a lot in common, which is nice.  I had a feeling that Tab and I would, sometimes you meet people and you just feel that you'll get along with them, and I def. get that with her.  So this weekend I had one crazy social night, followed by a nice and quiet social night.  

This coming weekend Zach and I are going skiing in NH while he's down there taking some classes.  I can't wait. :-) Then the following weekend, Jenn, Babs and Caryn are coming up to Maine for a visit, we're going to have a blast...again. :-)  Tabitha (and possibly her fiance) have tenitive plans to go out and take pictures.  We both like to take pictures, but both don't feel confident in our work...so we may team up to help each other out.  So yeah...things are going great.  

While I was out with Tab and Chris, I suddenly had this little ephiphany...when it comes to making friends, I have been in the mind set of finding 'best friends', but after this weekend, I think that just having a network of people that I hang out with from time-to-time is all I need.  I have close friends in Mass and I feel truly full-filled by those friendships.  I hope to make more close friends, and I'm sure I will, but I think that just knowing a bunch of people around Portland/Maine to hang out with is all I need.

Dressed for the Australian summer in T-shirt and shorts, Tobi Gutt left Germany on Saturday for a four-week holiday.

Instead of arriving ""down under"", Gutt found himself on a different continent and bound for the chilly state of Montana.

""I did wonder but I didn't want to say anything,"" Gutt told the Bild newspaper. ""I thought to myself, you can fly to Australia via the United States.""

Gutt's airline ticket routed him via the U.S. city of Portland, Oregon, to Billings, Montana. Only as he was about to board a commuter flight to Sidney -- an oil town of about 5,000 people -- did he realize his mistake.

The hapless tourist, who had only a thin jacket to keep out the winter cold, spent three days in Billings airport before he was able to buy a new ticket to Australia with 600 euros in cash that his parents and friends sent over from Germany.

""I didn't notice the mistake as my son is usually good with computers,"" his mother, Sabine, told Reuters.

So I'm feeling frustrated because the equipment in the photo department is horrible.  The timers don't can't count seconds correctly.  It can handle, say...20 seconds, but ask for 22 seconds and it spits out 24... The filters in the enlargers get stuck, which means you can be working on your 10th test strip (at about 10 minutes ea., you do the math) and it gets stuck...you have to jiggle it around and lo an behold it settles in a different spot, so you pretty much have to start all over.  I was contemplating Photo as a possible second major/minor, something...but that idea is out the door.  Oh...and the processor, another beautiful piece of machinery...that broke down two days ago, leaving us with nothing to print with because the damn thing is so old.   Photography is a tricky thing to begin with with out having to deal with this crap."

The problem is, I want to major in either Photo or GD.  I was told that the part II foundation classes could be fudged and taken later since I am, essentially, a transfer student.  If I am forced to take these part II foundation classes next semester, I won't be able to declare a major until next spring semester because I have to take GDII and/or PHII in able to major.  I told her this by email and she bounced back with some nonsense about haveing to take those classes so that I could major in the fall, which is bull shit because all part two classes are only offered in the spring.  Therefore, If I take these part two foundation classes now, I won't be able to declare my major until after spring of 2008.  At which point it will probably be questionable as to whether or not I'll have enough credits left to actually full fill the major's requirements.  With that in mind, if I don't declare this spring, what kind of classes will I be taking in Fall 2007???? GRRRRR!!!!!! I'm so pissed.  Mind you, my schedule has been fucked with since I signed up last spring.  Plus, I signed up for the classes I wanted, with the guidance of my adviser and with his signature.  This is bull shit."

I'm at school, doing homework, waiting for this thing to boot up.  I have a lot going on right now and basically I took today to do very little.  I actually skipped Art History this morning, we didn't have a lot going on today, we are between subjects because we just had our mid-term and haven't had lecture on the next topic yet, so I figured it wouldn't be that big of a deal.  I pulled together the bibliography and thesis statement for my final project and just emailed it to her instead of bringing it with me to class. Then I went down to the photo shop on Forest Ave. and picked up 6 rolls of 120 color film for my next photo project.  It's a really neat project, I'm really excited about it.  We have to spend the nex week and a half photographing every three hours (minus sleeping time).  It's a photo diary that we are working on.  After taking the pictures we will be editing them down and doing 10 prints.  Intially I was kind of hating this class, but I'm finding that I'm starting to like it.  The whole darkroom thing seemed overwelming in the beginning but it is starting to grow on me.  Actually, my first couple of projects were kind of crappy, but I'm hoping to make up for it in this next project.  We'll see how it goes.  We have to basically have some sort of narrative or connecting factor/thesis for this project, I'm not sure what it will be exactly but I think I'm going to do something based on this last 6 months or so.  I'm very much in the throws of my quarter-life crisis thing and am really re-learning about myself, who I am, what I want to be, what my values are and all of that. I have been and am going through a lot of changes.  Some of them are related to my ages, but also finally working through my own personal kinks.  I have learned that I project my own negative feelings towards myself as assumed fear/belief that others see me in those same negative lights.  I must get it from Mom because she seems to do that at times.  At anyrate, I have, with help, learned to identify when I do this and am now learning how to stop it.  I have been learning how to better control my thoughts/emotions and to feel much more balanced in my life.  I have also been re-evaluating my values, identifying what I believe, versus what I may have injested from family/friends/society and my not exactly believe myself.  I'm starting, for the first time in my life I am starting to feel confident about what I want from life, my personnel decisions and basically learning to validate and own my feelings and my actions.  It's an exciting time in my life and I'm pretty happy about it.  So I think I want to base my project around this idea/concept/time period. I'm not sure how I'm going to integrate it, but I'm sure I'll figure it out."

"event","Hello world!

Just putting it out there that I got a kitty last night. :-)  I'm so excited.  She's 1.5yrs old, a complete sweety and her name is Anna.  I was going to name my future kitty, ""Gerty"", but she doesn't seem like a Gerty.  Her previous owner, Anna, named her Misty.  I hate Misty and Anna seems to fit well, so in essence I have named her after her previous owner...not on purpose, it just seems to fit well. :-)  It's hard to describe her coloring, but she has the biggest, bluest eyes I have ever seen on a cat, she's so pretty!  So yeah, that's my brag session. (Though watch out, I see Christmas cards in the near future.  But I will NOT be one of those people that dresses his/her cat/dog/parakeet up)  On to other things! :-)"

Things are going well here...I just felt the need to say that Mac's are awesome.  My little lap top is going strong after all of these years, but because it only carrys 5GB of space, it's pretty packed.  I had loaded software on my comp. for the digital camera that I got for Christmas, but had to remove it come tax time so I could load that software.  Thing is, I need that camera for GD projects and I don't have room on my comp. to put the software back on.  I brought my camera into school this morning and gave it a try, and lo and behold...iPhoto picked it right up, no questions asked.  :-)"

"event","Watching the local news a few minutes ago, they had a segment about two of the highjackers from 9/11.  They drove up to Boston on the 10th and flew out of the Jetport in South Portland on the 11th to Boston where the boarded one of the planes out of Logan.  I'm spooked because I work at Jetport plaza, right at the end of the runway.  The two stayed at The Comfort Inn in South Portland and stayed in the area for about 12hours before leaving.  The scary part is the montage of security cameras that showed the highjackers.  One of which showed them at Jetport Gas...right across the street from my job. We (my job) do business with them, I pass by there all the time, know the lady that owns it and I get gas there as well.  I obviously didn't live here 5 years ago, but it brings 9/11 closer to me in a way that NYC hasn't in a way.  I've never been to New York City, so it's distant to me in a way. I've been to Logan, been to the Newark airport, but kneither of those places are/were local, daily life for me.  It just sends shivers down my back to think of them so close...Jetport gas will be the place where the highjackers were before they flew out, instead of the gas station across the street."

"event","""...And the child, Francie Nolan, was of all the Rommelys and all the Nolans.  She had the violent weaknesses and passion for beauty of the shanty Nolans.  She was a mosaic of her grandmother Romely's mysticism, her tale-telling, her great belief in everything and her compassion for the weak ones.  She had a lot of her grandfather Rommely's cruel will.  She had some of her Aunty Evy's talent for mimicking, some of Ruthie Nolan's possessiveness.  She had Aunt Sissy's love for life and her love for children.  She had Johnny's sentimentality without his good looks.  She had all of Katie's soft ways and only half of the invisible steel of Katie.  She was made up of all these good and these bad things.

She was made up of more, too.  She was the books she read in the library.  She was of the flower in the brown bowl.  Part of her life was made from the tree growing rankly in the yard.  She was the bitter quarrels she had with her brother whom she loved dearly. She was Katie's secret, despairing weeping.  She was the shame of her father staggering home drunk.

She was all of these things and of something more that did not come from the Rommelys nor the Nolans, the reading, the observing, the living from day to day.  It was something that had been born into her and her only- the something different from anyone else in the two families.  It was what God or whatever is His equivalent puts into each soul that is given life- the one different thing such as that which makes no two fingerprints on the face of the earth alike.""

"event","Life is so amazingly cool.  I have just had an amazing conversation with Jenny about life and where we are right now.  It is one of those situations where two people realize they are going through the exact same life stage at exactly the same time and each can completely relate to what the other is going through.  

So here's the deal..., as it is obvious from my posts, I've been having a bit of rough time.  Then, as I said in my last post, I have been feeling quite a bit better. Actually, I have been seeing a councelor about what I am going through and with in a very short amount of time she has been able to help me get out of, what I conclude to be, a depression.  I don't know if I'm completely out of it, but I'm on my way.  At any rate...here's the beef:

With the guidence of my coucelor, I have been working through some tough internal issues, re-evaluating myself, my life and, in her words, going through growing pains.  As an exciting turn of events. (lol)  I was talking to Jenny tonight, and it turns out that she is going through EXACTLY the same things I am.  With her extensive psychology background I learned that we are going through a ""Quarter-life crisis"".  Which is great, because rather than feeling like I've gone off the beaten path, I feel that I am just going through a normal phase in life.  We are so in-sink right now that we seem to even be at the same point with-in the ""crisis"".  We are both just emerging from the rough patch and are starting to feel more at ease with ourselves.  We both ended life-changing relationships within the past year (The wierder part is that both ex-b/f's have the same first name).  We both feel that we want to stick to ourselves for a while, ie:  staying home to relax, not worrying about guys and just taking care of ourselves, by ourselves, has become a priority.  Life is good tonight, and I just felt the need to share.  :-D"

Of course I still need to call them, which would help. I HATE making phone calls. I can do it if I have to, but in most cases I would prefer not to. Watch me get some job where I'm on the phones constantly...:-P""


Funny thing is that I actually did get a job where I'm on the phones constantly...:-p/lol

Also, as a side note, I've been feeling a lot more centered lately.  Things were crazy for a while but I'm starting to get much better perspective on things and am feeling a lot better.  :-)"

"event","So, how have things been??? Pretty crazy, as usual.  Actually, I need a vacation pretty badly.  My job has become severly less than desirable.  There is such a huge overload of work, that I can not help anyone and I leave work each day with bundles of guilt for all the people that I never got around to calling or helping because I never had time to do it.  Also, guilt for feeling like every person who walks in the door or calls in is interrupting my day....


Well, enough of that...I have a number of things on my agenda for the upcoming months.

1) Move...I need to find either a) a much cheaper apartment. b)find someone who is also looking for an apartment and then find one together. c) find an apartment with a roommate opening in it.

2) Job hunt...looking for some sort of job alternative that is flexible to my school schedule.

3) Per Ay's suggestion, I am going to look into take out school loans to help with living expenses so that I can work less and spend more time on school.

4) I am trying to spend more constructive time 'me' time.

5) I am trying to be more cheerful and such, to be more optimistic.  I've actually been feeling better, which is good.  

So yeah, I guess that is my current 'status'.  That's about it for now.  Ttyl"

"event","Hey folks that don't really read this.  I just write on this thing like someone reads it on a regular basis, but nobody does...which brings me to a recent thought...(not really, I just thought it would be cool to say that)...I have this re-accurring presence in my life that won't leave.  It's just like the ghost of someone, and I'm not talking about ghosts and gobblins...it's more of a symbol of something I miss in my life/have a hope for in my life. ( If someone (prob. Sam) is reading this, and this is sounding ever so vague, that's because it's suppose to be.)  This ghost-symbol just won't leave me alone.  it pops up in the most unlikely of places, at the most unlikely of times.  I'll be thinking about something so far from the subject and it shows up out of nowhere.  I've tried telling it to go away, to leave me alone, to live with it, to ignore, to just go with it and all that sort of stuff...the problem is that it won't go away.  It's been like this for nearly a year now and I just can't seem to shake it.  The thing is, I can't get rid of it because it is a part of me, or at least seems to have grown into me and become a part of me.  I think I need to step outside of some boundries and/or my comfort zone and then perhaps I'll be able to get rid of the remnants of this thing.  That's what it is, a remnant that was left behind but since then has evolved into this ghost-symbol.  It no longer holds any real meaning.  All it is now is a symbol of a hope, a want and a need. Not for what it is in reality, but for what that thing represented to me at the time that it was truly real.  It is hollow now, the word that I repeat in my mind and on my lips no longer represents what the actual word is.  Now it is just this empty word with all this meaning.  I can't even grasp what all the meaning is, only that it's indicative of some crazy mess in my head, which I am probably responsible for creating myself. Crap."

"event","I just felt like sharing thoughts...

I have a good friend from college named Jenny, we were pretty close during school, but after graduation, she kind of broke off from our little group and, despite her words of friendship, she just really wasn't there.  She hung out with a younger crowd and anytime I/we invited her somewhere, she either said no, or ended up canceling due to other obligations to in her life...anytime I tried to talk to her, conversations started strong, but quickly just died off.  I guess it was just that she and I were in different places and situations, with little to relate to...but I missed her friendship and was often angry at her for not ever being available.  

Well, it's funny how things have changed since I moved up here...her life has made some dramatic changes in the past year, like me, she is on her own, living alone and going back to school...suddenly we can relate again and we are the closest we've been in a really long time.  I feel like I have this whole other person that I can call and chat with, all over again.  Which is really nice.  I missed her tons and it's nice to have her back in my life.  :-)

So yeah, I think that's about it...though I guess I want to express a bit of my insecurities in another part of my social-life, primarily the one I have here...I have such good and strong relationships, but despite them, I am often very insecure about meeting and making friends with new people.  I suppose this is normal, but I take things more to heart and I also over-analyze...so yeah, the two in cahoots isn't such a good thing.

Basically, I have made a few friends here in Portland, primarily Robin and Megan, both really nice, both a lot of fun and people that I feel I share a lot in common with.  Despite the fact that they, and their friend, happily accepted my invitation for dinner last Saturday, and we had a good time, I continue to worry that I may be a pebble in their shoes.  I guess because I feel needy, because I need friendships here, I feel like I may be that annoying person, that nobody really likes, but who just keeps showing up to things...I know, this doesn't make ANY sense and I need to keep these insecurities in check.  It's just that, for some odd reason, I feel like I need to hear ""you are my friend and I like you"" in able to be secure in a friendship relationship...though, honestly, it's the same situation in a relationship too....:-P  It's the negative thoughts that I have to keep ignoring.  I have to keep thinking about the positives in my life, the things that I have accomplished.  For the first time in my life, after having had a really positive year, and things are moving forward in a really nice way, I feel like I have enough confidence to help keep my insecurities in check..."

"event","Hello,

How are things?  Things are going great here.  It's Sunday, homework day, and I'm at school using the computer because my days of illegal internet are over.   Somebodies caught on and cut me off, which is all as it should be.  I'm thinking about getting DSL, but I'm trying to decide how important it is.  I feel a little cut off from the world with out it...but maybe not being so connected is a good thing.....Naaah!

Anywho,

The last week was pretty great.  Work is going well, Bud was out on Thursday and Friday to go skiing (not sure how much he got in, it was pouring rain.)  Business was slow, but I found things to do to try to get business in the door.  Yesterday I worked at the Picture People, the first time in 2 weeks, I missed it!  My shift was only 5 hours and I didn't really want to leave, but I had to get ready for dinner.  Robin, Megan and their friend Dave came over for dinner.  I got out at 4 and they were coming for 7, so it gave me 3 hours to go to the grocery store, get home, clean, do dishes and rearrange some furniture to make some more room.  Robin arrived around 7 and Megan and Dave arrived at about 7:45.  Dinner was good- I made chicken stir fry with my favorite marinade, snap peas, carrots and broccoli.  Rice and bread were on the side.  Megan brought some wine (which we drank in coffee mugs! :-) ) and we all sat around the living room and chatted for a few hours.  It was really pretty nice.  I had a lot of fun.  They left at about 10:00 or so, at which point, my apartment was very empty feeling so I considered going for a walk.  But I ended up calling and talking to Jenny for about 2 hours!  I had called her earlier in the day and she apparently has sent me a letter...I haven't received it yet, but she thought that that was why I had called her earlier in the day.  Anywho, we really had a great 2 hour conversation about life, relationships and just stuff in general.  Also, and this is the best part of all, she's going to come up here on July 4th weekend with Babs and Car. :-D  Babs, Car and I had already planned it and I hadn't said anything to Jenny because she usually cancels stuff...and well, I threw it out there and she said that she had already talked to Babs about it and she promised she would come.  Her birthday is that weekend and she said that she has never had a birthday where she went out with her friends...it has always been a family thing with her and so we are going to take her down to the Old Port.  It's just going to be great...I can't wait.

Okay, so yeah...hum...I should prob. be preemptive as well and request the time off from the Picture People...I'm assuming Bud will just close up for the whole weekend...hum...

Okay, so that's my story, now I'm going to get going and get some real work done.  I have to print a ton of pictures today.

Later!"

Take more pictures during lunch.  After work, rush to class at 6:00.  Get out of class at 9:00---> Develop film from earlier in the day.  Go home and go to bed???

Not much going on here.  Feeling pretty tired right now, getting late.  I have to shoot 3 rolls of film tomorrow through out the day to capture light at different times of day.  Today was good.  Jim, Troy and I got up around 8 to supposively meet up with a few women we met last night at Bull Feeney's.  They didn't show up, but the food was good. So all was well.

Bull Feeney's was awesome. GREAT live music, great atmosphere, tons of people and just good times.  It was just a good time overall.  Jim wants come back down in 2weeks...though I just realized that that is the weekend I'm suppose to head to MA and CT for a few things.  Oi Vey...I also forgot to request the time off from P.P. and so I'm already scheduled that day...which sucks because I wasn't put on the schedule for next weekend because apparently they had requested everyone's availability and I hadn't given mine because I hadn't been there since before New Years...so yeah.

Tomorrow should be good though.  I have the whole day off.  I plan to...

1) Do homework
2) Buy supplies for classes. (Meaning I have to stop by the school for a supplies list)
3) Pull together a few resumes
4) Clean dishes

I have to go now, time for bed.  Need to be up early so that I can get early light.  Later!"

I went the 'other' way to get home and ended up stuck in traffic that eventually came to a full stop.  No car moved for an hour.  I was really stressed out at first, but eventually I just gave it up, rolled down the window, cranked the music and jammed out.  However, this meant I was VERY late to class, which started at 6...but when I finally showed up at about 7:30, the classroom was dark and empty.  Since I missed orientation yesterday, I had to kinda scramble around to figure a few things out...1) I figured out which mail box was mine. (found a handy-dandy-directory) 2) Was able to activate my FirstClass account...and then I tried to find an email address to contact my professor with.  However, it would seem that she is a visiting professor from Rutgers University and so I couldn't find any contact information.  I'm going to email the Registrar to get the information...I'm going to need my homework and such before next week, or at the very least, find out if class was even held.

About the only thing up for grabs is The SIMS, but I really don't want to delete that, besides, it's really only about 3MB of space.  The only things I can see deleting are some programs in Office, but that doesn't seem to be an option and I don't want to start messing around with that...could get a bit hairy.  Hum..."

So my day consisted of 1) Sleep 2) More sleep 3) a bit more sleep and 4) going down to SPACE Gallery to meet up with Robin and her friends to see three bands play.  It was fun, I really tried to socialize with people and things were pretty good.  The two girls that were at Robin's place on Thursday were there again today, Megan and Jrew....(Sorry, I don't know how to spell her name...,  Then there were a ton of other people, I didn't get to talk long with anyone in particular, but that was fine.  It was dark in there anyways and with the music playing it was rather difficult to talk.  I left early because I'm still tired and want to get up rather early in the morning so that I can start working on my list of Things To Do. It has grown rather large and needs some attention.  Well, I'm heading off to bed now...Good Night!"

"event","I finally finished the last project due for the 3-D class, a pear-shaped stack of cardboard with an indentation of sorts.  It didn't come out as well as I had hoped, but I think that considering the circumstances it came out pretty well.  There are just a few things that I could have put a bit more thought into.  Perhaps done a few more mesurements...

But it's done...

Also, I signed up for my classes this afternoon.  I will be taking Introduction to Photography & 2-D Design II.  Classes are 6hrs/week, 3 credits each.  I didn't realize that art classes have so many more hours for the same credits.  But I think it's because of the studio time that is needed.  I'll be in classes Mon-Thur, 6:00-9:00.  

Alright, the 2:30am rerun of Leno is on.  I usually watch that and go to bed...so I'm going to do that now...can you tell I'm feeling tired???"

All is going well here.  I have had a pretty crazy day but in kind of a good way.  I don't really know where to begin...I suppose with getting up.  I got up early so that I could go down to the school to do my homework before the last class (drawing) started.  My homework should have been done last night, but, in an effort to prioritize, I felt that socializing and getting to know people was really important.  The only thing though was that it put the pressure on for me to finish my assignment before class.  I finished it though, in about an hour and it came out pretty well.  It was also a lot of fun.  For class we had our second figure drawing session, this time with a guy.  After class (and the goodbyes :-() I headed home to get my car so that I could pick up my pieces. 

oi...I'll finish this up later...need to nap a bit more I think...ttyl"

"event","Hello!

I just had an awesome day.  The nicest day that I have had in a while.  Last night I was in the dumps...just upset because it had been 7 months since I moved and I hadn't made any friends.  I was also a mess because I find it so difficult to make friends. I went to bed feeling depressed.

I rolled out of bed this morning, feeling the same, and it turned out to be a really great day, everything just made a complete 180 degree turn.  First of all, it was a BEAUTIFUL day, it felt like spring.  Second of all, a girl that I had spoken to yesterday, Robin, called at about 8:50 this morning.  (We had exchanged numbers the day before because she is in a knitting club thing).  I didn't recongnize the number right away, thought maybe it was her, but I had to rush to class because I was going to be 10 minutes late.  I got there and overheard a girl tell Matt, our professor, that Robin had called her to say that she wouldn't be in because her back problems were acting up again and she basically couldn't get out of bed.  

Hearing this, I figured I ought to check the number to see if it was her's and if so, call her to see if she was okay.  It was her number and I called. She was in excrutiating pain, on the bathroom floor and unable to move.  She needed help so that she could get to the doctor's office.  I spoke with the professor and then left.  I brought her up to Falmouth where the Dr. performed miricles and she was thankfully able to walk out of the office.  Afterwards, she invited me to a dinner she was having with some of her knitting friends, tonight.  So I accepted. :-)  On top of it, someone from class, Kevin, invited me to a small MECA gathering they were having at his apartment.  

So now...let me go into this even further...because I love details...

1) Robin and her friends are AWESOME.  They are all so nice, around my age and I feel that I really have a lot in common with them.  We have all recently moved to Maine and are fairly local.  In fact, Robin lives kitty corner from me across the square.

2)  They are artsy and I LOVE that.  Part of the reason that I'm excited is because I want to get involved in the different arts and now I'll be able to.

3)  The gathering at Kevin's was pretty cool.  Robin couldn't make it because of her back, so I went alone.  Normally I get very tense and nervous.  I started to do that tonight and did to some extent for the night, but not nearly as badly as I normally do.  I think I actually talked to everyone there tonight and held up some conversations.  Then walked part of the way home with one girl.  I don't know if I really fit into their group, just because they are all so much younger, but it was still really great to be out there and socializing.  


So yeah, that was my day.  I also have two drawings due tomorrow morning at 9am.  I put them off for the night because I felt that, considering my recent state of mind, that socializing and getting to know people was very important.  I'm going in early tomorrow morning to complete my two assignments.  It's going to be crazy, but I'll drink down the coffee and get going on it.  

As a last note, I just have to say that it is so amazing how things work out.  It's days like this, where opportunities open up and give you the support you need, that makes everything so worth while.  Which is why I don't think that life and the events that occur in it, are random. I think some things are, but not everything.  You work and you work and you live and you live, then eventually, always, something breaks.  Then, the aid you need comes."

All I have to do now is

2) Get a TD shot from the USM Clinic (a service through MECA)
3) Register for Classes
4) Turn in a few things to Financial Aid.

All of this just feels so good. :-)"

"event","A message from John Cleese to the citizens of the United States of America:


In light of your failure to elect a competent President of the USA and
thus 
to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your 
independence, effective immediately. Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth 
II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths, and 
territories (excepting Kansas, which she does not fancy). Your new prime 
minister, Tony Blair, will appoint a governor for America without the need 
for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A 
questionnaire may be circulated next year to determine whether any of you 
noticed. To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the 
following rules are introduced with immediate effect:
If there are any words here you do not understand, you should look them up 
in the Oxford English Dictionary.
1. While you are at it, look up aluminium, and check the pronunciation 
guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.
2. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 
'neighbour.' Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping 
half the letters, and the suffix ize will be replaced by the suffix ise. 
Generally, you will be expected to raise your vocabulary to acceptable 
levels. (look up vocabulary).
3. Using the same twenty-seven words interspersed with filler noises such
as 
""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of 
communication. There is no such thing as US English. We will let Microsoft 
know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take 
account of the reinstated letter 'u' and the elimination of -ize. You will 
relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen.
4. July 4th will no longer be celebrated as a holiday.
5. You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers,
or 
therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows
that 
you're not adult enough to be independent. Guns should only be handled by 
adults. If you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing
someone 
or speaking to a therapist then you're not grown up enough to handle a gun.
6. Therefore, you will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more 
dangerous than a vegetable peeler. A permit will be required if you wish
to 
carry a vegetable peeler in public.
7. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and this is for your 
own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.
8. All intersections will be replaced with roundabouts, and you will start 
driving on the left with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go 
metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. 
Both roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British
sense 
of humour.
9. The Former USA will adopt UK prices on petrol (which you have been 
calling gasoline) - roughly $6/US gallon. Get used to it.
10. You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries 
are not real chips, and those things you insist on calling potato chips
are 
properly called crisps. Real chips are thick cut, fried in animal fat, and 
dressed not with catsup but with vinegar.
11. The cold tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually
beer 
at all. Henceforth, only proper British Bitter will be referred to as
beer, 
and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as 
Lager. American brands will be referred to as Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine, so 
that all can be sold without risk of further confusion.
12. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as good 
guys. Hollywood will also be required to cast English actors to play
English 
characters. Watching Andie MacDowell attempt English dialogue in Four 
Weddings and a Funeral was an experience akin to having one's ears removed 
with a cheese grater.
13. You will cease playing American football. There is only one kind of 
proper football; you call it soccer. Those of you brave enough will, in 
time, be allowed to play rugby (which has some similarities to American 
football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or 
wearing full kevlar body armour like a bunch of nancies).
14. Further, you will stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host
an 
event called the World Series for a game which is not played outside of 
America. Since only 21% of you are aware that there is a world beyond your 
borders, your error is understandable.
15. You must tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us mad.
16. An internal revenue agent (i.e. tax collector) from Her Majesty's 
Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all
monies 
due (backdated to 1776).
17. Daily Tea Time begins promptly at 4 PM with proper cups, never mugs, 
with high quality biscuits (cookies) and cakes; strawberries in season.
Thank you for your co-operation."

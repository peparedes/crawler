But make no mistake: WE WILL <u>STILL</u> CONTINUE TO HOLD OUR YEARLY HALLOWEEN PARTY TOGETHER!!!

It just really sucks that this year we won't get one. *moo*

We're still handing out candy in our front yard, though..."

Today, my hubby and I picked up supplies for this year's costumes. I'm going as a porcelain doll and he's going to be... well, I guess he's either a murder victim or a poorly dressed vampire. You'll see what I mean when we post party pics...

"event","<b>ABC Family's 13 Nights of Halloween</b> launches this year on <b>Thursday, October 19th</b>. A good, scary time is to be had by all (minus all the blood-and-guts stuff). While this promises to be family-safe programming, this does <i>not</i> mean you won't get a good creep out of it. This year's lineup includes all-new episodes of <i>Scariest Places on Earth</i> - one of our yearly favorites! Ryan and I look forward to it each October, and new episodes will certainly entertain us well. Also showing is the premiere of a new ABC Family Original Movie, <i>The Initiation of Sarah</i> (Oct. 22nd). Visit the site here and see the schedule for yourself:

"event","Well, looks like AMC finally got their heads out of their... well, you know. Monsterfest has returned yet again, and this year they have a smashing lineup of both old and new classics. Yes, the <b>Universal Monsters</b> are back! They've even seen fit to throw in a little <b>Godzilla</b> for good measure. I guess enough people finally complained, because (in my opinion), it's been at least a few years since the last <i>good</i> Monsterfest.

So be on the lookout for <b>Dracula</b>, <b>Frankenstein</b> and <b>The Wolf Man</b>, along with <b>Michael Myers</b>, <b>Freddy</b> and <b>Chucky</b>. This year's Monsterfest is <i>actually</i> going to be <i>fun</i> - FINALLY!

"event","This year's itinerary is still being worked out, but I've got the basics down:

<b>Monday, October 30th - Halloween Party @ Mari's</b>
(This year's theme is pirates - *YAARR*!!)

<b>Tuesday, October 31st - Traditional Halloween @ Home</b>
(We're planning on hosting a sort of trick-or-treat table out in the front yard if we can make it work.)

<b>Thursday, November 2nd - Day of the Dead</b>
(With the usual lunch fare and trip to the cemetery. RIP to all our loved ones, especially my maternal grandfather!)

-- EDIT --

The Halloween party plans have changed a bit. Now everything will be held in my front yard on the 31st and we will be dressing as zombie hippies. Yes, you heard right... *insert uncontrollable laughter and fun-poking here*"

Today we held our second annual Day of the Dead celebration. It was nothing spectacular, and it was a day earlier this year, but we enjoyed ourselves as usual. We started off by visiting a few family graves (my grandfather's in particular), then returned home for some KFC and that Mexican dead-bread. All in all, it was pretty nice - and we'll do it again next year!"

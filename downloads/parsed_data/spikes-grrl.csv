"event","I am sitting here in the library killing time until my discussion section starts at 4:40. Mondays are the worst because I get out of class at noon and have to kill time until discussion. Not so bad, you say? Trust me, forcing myself to stay on campus instead of going home to hang out with my Jim is tough!! I am very happy today because I got a 95 on my Statistics exam and I went to the gym with my friend Yvonne and signed up to get a personal trainer and to start working out!! I am very inspired by my friend Yvonne right now because we are working together to get healthy and she is being much more diligent about the diet than I am!! I must get back on track, Football weekends are killing me-not the healthiest of foods! I also have DVR at my house now and it is awesome!! Also necessary because my beloved Buffy people are on opposite each other on their new shows!!I got comcast internet at the same time and it is a revelation!! Dial up is a nightmare I no longer have to face!! Ok,people I am off to class!"

"event","I had a really good day at work today so I thought I would share the joy--it was a very productive fun day. It is starting to feel more like old Borders to me, perhaps I am looking through rose colored glasses. Since I decided on my last day I have found myself rather nostalgic for a job I have'nt left yet! I have stuck with the not smoking and have eaten healthy and exercised for a week, so far so good."

"event","Finally, right? I am really not good at this. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to add a new post! considering I have'nt touched it since December I guess that is not all too surprising! I just finished working out and I am going to eat something and get ready to go to work. I am in an interesting place mentally right now. I am feeling very strong. I had quit smoking about 6 weeks ago and then i lapsed over vacation (not altogether surprising) but when a friend(with good intentions) mentioned the fact that they could'nt keep up with whether I was smoking or not it made me feel really weak and foolish, and for the first time that was unacceptable to me. I quit the next day and have'nt even wanted one since. It's strange. I just kind of had a revelation that the only thing keeping me from accomplishing any of my goals is me, plain and simple. I had said to my husband around the same time that I could'nt quit until he was ready to, that I could'nt be strong without him. Utter foolishness. There have been cigarettes in the house for the past 3 days and i have'nt really even been tempted. It's odd. The same with exercise and eating healthy. I have always talked a good game and then fallen off the wagon. I am sick of it. I tried to sign up for a weight loss study at UT because I thought having support and structure would keep me on track but I could'nt take part because Jim and I are trying to get pregnant. What better reason to get healthy right? When I told Jim he said forget it, baby is more important than losing weight. It made me start thinking, if a baby is the most important thing to us right now then getting healthy and being strong should be the top priority in my life. Why has'nt it been? because I was weak. And foolish. NO MORE."

"event","Hello all. I am trying to key down enough to go to sleep so i thought i would journal a bit. I would like to issue a general apology to all my friends that i have been bitching and moaning to lately! i feel like that is all i have been doing, i am generally a pretty cheery person(I think) so it really bugs me. Work is really making me crazy in conjunction with school and we all know about the manager that has made it a personal mission to make me crazy(yes,moon i know they are not really trying to make me crazy lol) I just wish this Christmas business would be civilized enough to wait until after finals!!! I figured out earlier today that i should graduate in May of next year. It seemed a lot sooner before i went to the meeting-now, it feels like forever! ok- i love you all, talk to you later!!"

"event","hello all. i am sitting in Yvonnes office posting to my lj-ha! I have had a rough few weeks but school is almost out!!!!! i am stressed because i am balancing on the verge of a 4.0 and it is really getting to me. It is close enough to the end that i can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Unfortunately it is the oncoming train of Christmas in retail hell!!! I am so glad that it is the end of the week. All i have to do today is give blood and go to my (last!!!) discussion class in History. Oh, blast, I have to go to the grocery store. Oh well.  I am going to buy Buffy (hopefully) on the first.  Of course I probably won't really get to watch it until January. I think i am going to take some days off in January and crawl in my cocoon and watch season 7. I have it all on vhs, but-vhs sucks!
ok, i think i am going to give Yvonne her desk back. Talk to you guys soon!"

"event","Things have been interesting since I last posted. Nothing big. I finally got off my fat ass and painted my room. Good color choices by me!! I assembled the bed and the fucking thing was a size smaller than what I orederd, paid for, waited forever to get and finally went and got myself pos. Fuck!! So the fucking thing is supposed to be re-sent to me sometime this week in the correct size. In the time between said delivery I have this mammoth box chillen' in my fucking living room. A HUGE ass thing cuz oh, yeah, i got to take the damn thing apart as well. BOOOOOOOOOO West Elm! 

I picked up a second job at the EP (Eastern Pearl) and I have to say that I'm fucking good at it too. Apparently I have a good personallity for being a Bouncer. The money is amazing. The kick back on the tips I get from the bartenders is great. I make more on a Friday/Saturday work week there then I do working a five day work week at Starbucks. Speaking of SB; I hate my manager. So much in fact that when she called me a ""minority"" in the store that I called the compliance hotline and narked on her for it. I'm hoping she get's fired. 

CAN YOU BELIEVE STEVEN AND KELLY??!!!!!???!!!!!!???? OMFG! I cannot believe! Those two are fucking insane and I love em' for it. But as I understand it, the whole thing was slightly awkward. Two very brave men. 


Heather, I love you, pick up your fucking phone. (I'm typing this as I wait for you to pick up the fucking phone.)

"event","I'm really glad I decided to cash in all of my vacation hours and chill this week. I did nothing really worth mentioning on Friday...well I went out to BFE with Steven and got my bed which ended up being back ordered from weeks ago. That was fun. Then I went to bed early. Saturday morning I got up fucking early as hell, sadly a bi-product of opening for work almost every day now, and watched cartoon from 7a until 11a. I ate way to many bowels of Penut Butter Crunch and then Bill made me a feta thingie. I dicked around all day Saturday and then Bill and I headed off to the Garbage concert. 

What can I say about the Garbage concert? 

When I can hear myself talking I'll try to explain it all, but last night was the bands 10th year of being a band and so it seemed they wanted it to be extra good. The open band was cool for about 30 seconds. So then after the concert and bad Wendy's, I went to bed. 


Today (Sunday) I left four hours early for the airport because there was an issue with our tickets when Bill tried to check in on-line this morning. Something to do with our upgrade or whatever, and then we went to kill some time and had breakfast at Old Wives Tale. meh. The fun part about that was that as we where getting close to the place, a bunch of people where walking into this Four Square Church and Dead Kennedys just happend to come up on the iPod. So I blasted it with all of the windows down and got a lot of nasty looks for it.  go ahead and judge me Preacher guy, just remember I fucked your wife!

Back at the airport I am looking at magazines and Bill is getting bored and wants to go thru the gate. I hear this ""Jesse! C'mere quick!"" So I go see what is so important as to forestall my Cross-Word book selection and it's the bassist from Garbage talking to Bill. 

Holy shit...

He walks away as I get to Bill and Bill is all half crazed and then Shirley Manson walks up. She had this look in her eyes when 6'5 Bill says ""HI!"" and it's the look of ""What is he going to do?"".  I had never realized that she is only about 5'1/5'3. Get the picture? so she ask's how we are doing and Bill says wonderfull. She smiles and notices that Bill has on one of the concert tee's and ask's if he enjoyed the show. ""I'm a biggger fan then I was the day before yesterday"" from Bill and from me ""Yeah. the best yet, thank you."" and she moves in a little closer. So we ""formally"" introduce ourselves and talk about why she loves Portland so much (reminds her of home) and how she is holding up during the first leg of the tour and stuff. I mentioned that I thought it was nice to see her and the band just walking out in the open like they were and she tells us that we had been the first to stop her all day. I tell her that my buddy Jaycie was really bummed that she had too miss the show last night and so I am to tell her, from Shirley, ""Tell her that I'm gratefull for the long time support and that next time she better fucking show up to the show, even if it means she has too quit her job!"" and then she laughs. I have to say that she has amazing eyes. 
So Bill and I thank her again and start to walk away, and then I turn back to her and say ""Tell Butch that a fan in Portland is in love with him!"" she busted up at that one. Bill wishes her a safe trip to San Fran and then we went to get some coffee. 
After the gate people took all of our lighters. 

So now I am in Denver, the night before the Tori Amos concert at Red Rocks and we just got back from some Grill Pub place called Apollosa, which I have formally re-named Apollonia. I'm slightly bummed because I burnt the roof of my mouth on the ribs, but that pales in the light of the shit for ass service we got. 


Over all I'm having the best vacation in recent memory and I am pleased that the whole fucking thing ends in a $400.00 tattoo next week. That's almost as good as getting paid for not having to work.

Tuh-huh!!

I'm too lazy to make the link pretty. But it comes to the house in 2 weeks and it's going to be the blonde wood. So I guess I'd better start painting the bedroom now. I was thinking about getting a queen sized but decided that the space was too small, so I'm sticking to the full size. Honestly, I'm glad the bedroom is going to be faster and more affordable then my living room was because I really want to start saving up for the new TV and speakers and stuff that I am going to get and put in the ""media room"". AKA Sarah's old bedroom.

You like things edgy, subtle, and smart. I guess that means you're probably an intellectual, but don't take that  to mean you're pretentious.

"event","So when Bill got back from Virginia he told me that he wasen't able to get the Tori tickets. He had to leave the Hotel before they went on sale. I wasen't able to take a crad and go get some beacause I had too switch shifts on Saturday so I could pick Bill up from the airport. So I had deflated my hopes because I didn't want shitty seats and I didn't want to think about missing her when she was sooooooooo fucking close. So when he told me didn't have any, I was only something close to crushed. 

So instead we are going to Red Rocks!! Fuck yeah! I love that place. It is amazing and the sound is amazing and the tickets are second row reserved seating and I totally have to have sex right now just thinking about it all! (After I clean up the pee)
This will be the second time in less than a year I'm flying to Colorado to see a kick ass show at Red Rocks. Last time was Norah Jones. The seat's sucked, but the sound was out of this world. I loved it. I wonder if Sarah still wears that Norah tee shirt I got her there? I wouldn't be surprised if she tossed it, but I dropped all of my money on that thing! 
Anyway...

I'm almost more excited about having a job and money to spend when I get there. Last year I didn't have either. But I was told that I needen't worry about that. *cough cough* 
First class is almost more fun then the concert, but that is just because of the free, never ending, booze. 

Bill was worried that I'd be upset with him about the Red Rocks thing because in order to go, I need time off from work, and he was worried that with short notice I'd get fucked out of going. I tried to make it clear that Bill is a very hard guy to hate or be mad at. When you add the fact that I'm fucked in love with him, it's even harder. The fact that he even said he wanted to try and get me tickets so I could go see my favorite musicain is all I really needed."

"event","Bill's house seems to be drawing in a number of wild animals. The other night, the biggest fucking Racoon I have ever seen comes up the little hill in his backyard and just sit's there and looks at me while I am trying to smoke and read. Then today as I am trying to smoke and read, a Doe come's plugging up the hill in the same spot. WTF!? The odd thing is it sit's down and dosen't move. I don't get it, but I am waiting for the Lion now. Then I'll really pee when I look up and something huge is just hanging out. Maybe I'm the Beast Master and I don't even know it. How cool would that be? I could just get animals to maul everybody for me. 

I've been working at work a lot and working on the house a lot. I have all of the furniture in the living room finally and I am jazzed about it. So now Bill and I are just looking for accent pieces to finnish it off and then we are moving on to the bathroom. My wallet is super thin between rent and bills and shit, yet I still got the couch I wanted and nice dinning room chairs and table. (The table and chairs are a steal: $649.00 for all three pieces at West Elm, located in the Pearl District) I really want to have a party soon, but I have to keep pushing it back and I'm getting mad about that. There is two people I absolutly have to have there: Heather and Stefanie. So I've got to get them. It just won't be the same without 'em. 

My Moon and Stars is in Richmond Virginia for work right now and I miss him. It's actually more or less an ache. But he called me from the Jefferson (where he's staying) and asked if I would like to go see Garbage on the 2nd of September and Tori on the 9th of September. I told him that I wish I could take the time off of work to go. Then he said okay and that was that. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!!?! I pissed the bed and had a seizure is what I did. Fuck yeah I want to go! So he got the pre-sale tickets for Garbage today and told me to take the credit card of my choice and go and get Tori tickets on Saturday when they go on sale. For Garbage we are sitting in the middle several rows back. That is very cool, but Shirley moves around a lot and so almost pointless. But then again, close seats are close seats. 

How spoiled am I?

My new boss Amy is starting my Shift Lead training and so soon I get to make $11 an hour and faster growth on vacation hours. Go me!!! 

Anyway, I love almost all of you. 

Me

Heather: we'll talk soon and get something nailed down. Maybe I can throw the bash when you are making a return trip to Washington and can crash over night at my pad after over consuming. I miss you, I love you, and I'm glad that you are getting somewhere with this Red Bluffs shit. Kiss Kiss

"event","I love being me. I really do. I guess one of the perks of being me is that for some reason, I always find out things that I shouldn't, or things that people wish I wouldn't.

Case in point: yesterday!

I was talking to a person I haven't had a lot of contact with recently. And until yesterday she was some what miff'ed at me. Well what the fuck, of course she would be mad at me if she's only been hearing lies against me. So after about seven minutes of explanations from me, my little bird cracked and let me know some interesting things. Like some one keeping tabs on me and some of mine. Now, this nameless person recently decided that because I no longer chose to back a worthless gutter daughter of a whore that I was no longer worthy to be associated with. Not only that, but any one else choosing to be a friend of mine couldn't be one with him. I don't understand people who deliver ultimatums like that. How worthless. How weak and juvenile. Who is one person to say to another that they have to be with only one or the other. This same person also told me that I had to choose between my love or him. So fuck you then. People who know me know that I always choose the person that didn't have the audacity to make me choose to begin with. But I side bar...back to the point at hand!

This lack luster fuck wit has been trying to keep tabs on me, us, everyone who chose ""against"" him. Disagreed with him. Thus ""loosing"" him. Wow...But to be so unable to stick with something that leaves you with no breathing room. To try and back out of something that has no door, window, or escape hatch...I just don't understand. 

So here is a letter that sums up what I think!

Dear *nameless person*,

If you want nothing to do with us, why are you skulking around and trying to discern what we are doing. Sniffing into business that you are no longer privy to? Sure, shit on the internet is fair game, but if you honestly don't want anything to do with us, why keep looking back? I can assure you that those of us that have continued on with each other have not. The only time that we even talk about you is when you pop up and try to get in our space. We stopped caring for you several months ago. You left us no other avenue based on the terms of <i>your own demands!</i> So what do you want? Forgiveness? <i>Forgetfulness</i>? I think you forgot that you are dealing with people who have long memories. People who have remained friends despite distance, time, polar opposite interests, lovers, girlfriends, boyfriends, fucking x roommates, and monetary status. You bent over and fucked yourself, not us. We have remaind true to each other. We did not prove to be the weaker buddy. One of the reasons we are strong is because we keep each other strong. 

It seems to me that you made a big mistake thinking that you could just flush us like a tampon after sopping up your little monthly messes. 

Remember who set the terms when you cry alone, in a place that you are all but alone
Remember who set the terms when you continue to sit by your lonesome little self
Remember who set the terms when you continue to ""spy"" on us and relate to other's we've left behind what is going on
Remember who set the terms when you can't get back in with a crowd that was struggling to remember why you were included to begin with

Although I don't owe you an explanation, the name for my party next month, ""Ding Dong The Bitch is Gone"", was not coined by me. It was developed by other's that had first hand experience with the bitch. Not me...although I have to agree. If you need to keep her on that line of hate, so that she'll talk against me and help you feel comfortable about your desolation, then fine. I don't care what two peas in a pod have to say.
You wanted out, so we let you out. I told you months ago in an e-mail that I was giving you the gift of keeping your name off of my tongue. I only asked that you return the favor. So again, return the favor...

Stay out of our business, 
The Sadist

Aaaaaaaaaaaannnnnd I'm done!"

<b>HAPPY MAY DAY!</b>

What a worthless time in the year. I think that we should celebrate the beginning of something so retarded as May. Really, what is so great about May first? Some girl considered old enough to fuck, so we have them dance around some fucking poll until some guy decided's he can stand fucking her, when all he really wants is his buddy standing next to him too lick his balls. And not to mention the fact that May Day jacks up the cost of everything for 24 hours. GAWD! No really I know these things.

So what have I been up to the last couple of days...hmmmmmmm...Nothing to special. I have been at work a lot. Uh, I've been working on the house tons as well. I got the carpet squares I ordered and they look fan-fucking-tastic! And on Friday, I painted my ceiling. The light in the house is so bad. So I didn't cover some area's as well as I needed to. Well, yesterday I was at the home De-pot getting some shit (more blue painters tape, 1"" brush) and I bought some light bulbs. I though that there was only two in there, but I got a good deal: ""natural"" light: 4 for a Dollar! So I get home after work last night and decide to put them in. So I find out to much glee that the light fixture in my living room actually take's <b>4</b> light bulbs...I put them in and turn on the light switch and I was almost blinded by the sheer force of all four 100 watt light bulbs. OMG! OMG! OMG! I can see my soul in here!

I got fucking sloppy drunk last night at the West Side. One too many PBRs, one too many Tic-Tacs, one too mant Vodka Tonics. Meh. But the coffee shop next door holds these little all ages raves. Some nasty ugly guy came in and the bartender and I where playing Go Fish! he makes some half assed comment on it. 'tender and I flip him shit. So he start's talking about wanting a refund when we keep making fun of him, and the bartender Mellisa, is all ""you can't get a refund on a fucking pint you ass."" and everyone there is laughing. He's all, ""how about you give me 50 cents back?"" So I say ""What? Did you have to break your five and now you are regretting it? Can't get a chalupa after the ""rave"" is over? Awwww"" we made him so mad he wanted to go outside and drink his beer. So of course we make fun of him about all of that. ""Do you think I'm dumb enough to let you go drink that outside when there is a bunch of minors waiting for you to come back over there? I swear to god, either the Vick's Vapo rub made you stupid, or your just ugly and stupid."" You get the point. Then I had this amazing sandwhich from Wendy's and for the second Saturday in a row, dropped my Biggie sized Sprite on the kitchen floor on the same fucking spot. ARGGGGH!

Um...I already mentioned painting on Friday, but I also went to a birthday party. It was funny...there was a lot of booze there and I was doing a lot of shot's and drinking a lot of PBR in between all of them. I was drinking like it was my birthday, but it totally wasen't. Although I was doing this at the request of the actual birthday girl...still...too...much...
So blah blah blah...the quest of honor ends up getting really trashed and got into it with another one of our friends. So she storms off and goes home. (She lives a block away from where we had the party) People are all...oh ok and then her bf takes off after her. People start to drift home...I'm left alone with Salsa Con Queso dip and chips and a fresh fifth of Vodka looking at me...So I eat as many chips as I can and pound the Vodka and run home. (I llve a block and a half away from where we had the party) I dunno...you do wierd things when you are really drunk and feel like you would/could fuck anything with any kind of trim. Firday night when I got home, Brandt was sleeping in my bed and while we were fucking, I got a drunk dial from some one that shall remain nameless, looking to get some for me as well. I almost had him come over. the more the merrier right?

So now it's Sunday and I have a shit shift ahead of me: 

2:30-5:00 I am just some regular floor person. 
5:00-9:00 I have to do all the really big deep cleaning things in the store
9:00-11:00 I have to attend a meeting

wtf? I have to clock in three seperate times, under three seperate store coverage listing today.
Then let's add the fact that I have to be back at work at 6:15a so I can't even fuck tonight because I have to go home and sleep. Sometime's I hate Starbucks. 


Read ANNE BISHOP's:THE DARK JEWEL'S TRILOGY. omfg. If you like your high fantasy...well high, then do it. Who can go wrong when Satain (Saetan in the book) has two sons, Daemon and Lucivar, and all three of them want to serve a little girl. Who would have thought that Saetan is a good guy and civil to boot? No really read, read, read, read, read these fucking books (I wonder if I could get that onto Reading Rainbow?)

I haven't lived alone for a long time and it is something that I wish I could have afforded a long time ago...again? Does that make sence? I dunno if it does, but whatever.

I've decided to hold the party on June the 17th. That is a Friday and that same weekend is Pride. I think that I have Bill convinced to risk being seen in town during the daytime and enjoy himself. Considering I have him slowly throwing the door of his closet open, he just might go! Heather, you need to be here for that weekend because it would be nice to have my #2 fruit fly around. (I'm sure Steven agrees)

"event","I was at Dania yesterday. Dania...oh how I love thee. Dania is like that one guy you really want to take home, so you figure a way to make it work. In this case yesterday, it was a chair! YAY! And the way I figured out how to make it work was convince myself that it was cool that it was 20% off (that's $120.00 cheaper) and drop the $439.00 for it. So rent is due in three days and I have nothing left to pay for it. But at least I have a nice place to sit my ass down on when I'm home. 

Should I still call it home if I don't pay rent? 

In other news, some person who reasponded to Heathers live journal thinks that I'm hot even though it is a fucking shitty picture. I wonder if this person is a boy or a girl. In either case, we need to meet and make out!

I also lost the comdey compition on Sunday. It was fun regardless though. I had to close at work that night and rushed over to the bar and get on the list. So I was there and yeah and I got so loaded. Not as loaded as I can get when the fancy strikes me, but more loaed than I've been in awhile. I had 4 tic-tac's, two vodka tonics, a purple hooter, 5 PBR's, and a pimp juice...Then I sat there and talked to another comic for awhile. I didn't get to bed until 2ish and I had to get up at 5. Then I had to be at work at 6...I had a rough morning. I crashed very early last night and I just got up about 24 minutes ago. Bill want's me to make Lattes. I just want to run in circles right now as I slept for 16+ hours and got my dick sucked when I woke up.

"event","FRIDAY:

I went to get my hair cut. At the hair cut place, Bishops, I had a belt buvkle made. It says ""LABIA"". No shit. It's funny as hell. I had a girl ask me what that meant, and I was floored, and she was shocked to learn something new! I went to a furniture place called Design Within Reach. This place is a little modern, but I like it. It is also the work place of a hot dickboy named Todd. Todd and I seem to want to have sex...the first time I was in there, he told me about a 10% off your first order thing. So my response was ""oh, sorta' like popping my cherry?"" and he laughed and said ""make sure you come to me for that."" That was last Saturday. So when Bill and I went back in of Friday we purchased over $500 worth of book shelving and rug squares. That whole morning, from the time I got up to about 4pm, I had this mammoth pulsating erection. I also was not wearing underwear as usual. So Todd, finding all sort's of ways to touch me or ""bump"" into me couldn't stop staring at this massive bulge in my pants as I was sitting down next to him...opps...So he want's to come over soon and see the house when I am done painting and the shelves are up and the couch has been deliverd...and then come to the house warming party that I am calling ""Ding Dong the Bitch is gone!"" party. Huh...I smell a trick with a tight bodied hotty soon...Later that night I got piss ass drunk at the West Side and went to bed early. (Brandt had to work)

SATURDAY:

I did shit. Had lunch at Taco Bell, got paint from the Home Depot, pronounced De-Pot, and made Bill bid and win Tori Amos t-shirts for me. Then I went to work from 6:30p until 10:30p. I went to the West Side, had a PBR, went home and fell asleep. 

SUNDAY:

I'm getting ready to go to Steven's work with Randi and do so inventory for ten dollars an hour...PLUS FOOD!!! WOOOOOO HOOOOO! If we get done in time, and I get get to the West Side soon enough, I will be participating in a comedy compition...."

"event","So I cleaned the hell out of my house. It was awesome!!! As I was rocking out to some heavy music, I was throughly destroying all traces of Sarah and her shitty attitude. I didn't have the heart to wash my sheet's...(see last entry)
It put me into this insanly good mood. I played some games afterwards and just chilled. Steven was supposed to come over, but is feeling too ill at the moment. Poopy. Bill came and got me and we went to the store for dinner stuff as it was Survivor night; good food and such. 

So I guess the bi-polar comes in when he starts to talk to me about hooking up this weekend while I am working. And whatever, I'm starting to feel down, but then I fight back secretly by re playing Brandt's visit...heheh and not trying to feel down because I don't fucking care anymore. And then I really truely felt that I didn't care and it was wonderfull. I have to say that I have some great buddies though. Bill was talking about how he fired off an e-mail to Steven instead of this trick ron or whatever, and Steven let him have it. When Bill was telling me about it I was laughing really hard. So I got to Bill's place, and as he was making dinner I ran upstairs and called Brandt and we phone fucked. HA HA! what am I doing? I dunno but I'm having fun...right? So now that the evening is drawing to a close, Bill has gotten smashed on hooch, and I guess I get to stay here tonight. I think I'm going to blue ball him again tonight. 

I'm going to go and get my hair cut tomorrow as I need one badly. 
Bill is going to order some bookshelfs for me.
Bill is going to buy my a rug.
I get paid tomorrow.
I'm going to call Brandt first thing in the morning and arrange for him to spend the night. 
I'm going to go drink like a fish at the EP tomorrow!
I'm not going to cry over this until next week.

Thanks Steven, for having my back like that."

"event","So I talked to Steven about going to bed last night, rather than going out. I went home from Bill's and went to bed. Three or so hours later, I have this hot sexy guy trying to climb into my bed without waking my ass up. Didn't work. We talked for about 4 hours and then made out for 2 with a lot of heavy petting and dry fucking and then went back to bed. The last thing I remember thinking before I was whisked away to dream land was ""I need to fucking get his copy of the house key back, or change the locks. This is too tempting."" Well, I got up this morning (double entendre) and before I knew it, I was getting some yummy head! Then before I knew it I was giving some and then before I knew it, I was balls deep in his...hey now I'm a lady!...

There is something to be said about my will power right as I am waking up. I don't have any. I haven't touched weed in about two months, but had a wake and bake before I had a wake and fuck. I have been able to keep my hands off of Brandt for months now, but this morning, he pounced and I just didn't want to tell him no. This guy is so awesome. As a side bar he has a neck like a bull and a cock to match. I love his neck...woof woof! I feel slightly guilty. I feel like I did it because I was revenge fucking for shit that went down a few weeks ago. Shit I still feel bad about. But as I sit here typing and smoking, I have been thinking that it isn't revenge fucking if you have no lover to revenge fuck against. Bill isn't my Husband. Bill isn't my Boyfriend. I slept with Brandt because he treats me well. He talks to me. He touches me. He confides in me. He takes me out on dates, not just trips to the bar, or 5 star resturants to get some bragging rights. I fucked Brandt for a myrid of reason. Reason #2 being the guys mammoth dick...Reason #1 being too personal to share here.

The lesson I wish to impart to you kids is this:

Jesse is more apt to comply first thing in the morning."

I got up and I nailed every other comics balls to the wall. I guess I owe it to some liquid courage, because I just didn't feel like going up until I got some pints in me. Thank you yet again PbeR's. I owe you! I was the last one called and the whole show in general was lame. Most of my fellow ""comedy chasers"" just couldn't seem to pull it off tonight. I think it's mostly in part because they want to try new things but are affraid to let it fly. They stiffle it. So they fall back onto thier standard jokes. Shit we've heard a billion times.

It's funny how the people you know very well change. Maybe not change so much as just develop in areas without you. Monju...my poor lonely Monju. I wonder if you will ever get it. Will you ever see that rip's are patchable? Or are you too busy trying to build that army against me? I feel sad that you thought I would have chossen you when you know that I always go with the person that dosen't deliver the ultimatum. I feel so bad for you. Who do you have left?
And Bill...
My poor sweet Bill. God how much do I love you. It's a sting that just haunts everything I do. From sleeping to eating to drinking to laughing to playing to breathing...It's forever long. I wish that I had the abilities to speak of my heart in an open manner. If I could just tell you what is going on inside of me, this uncontroled burn, then maybe you could wise up and figure out how to keep me. 
Do you know that I know about Steam?
Do you know that I almost left with my ex?
Do you know that you only have to claim me, and I am yours until you discard me?
Do you know that I have never admitted something like this to anyone, even myself?

Of course you don't. Or I wouldn't be here typing it out.

I wonder what it would take to get you to admit that you now know the reason's people who get together, date, marry whatever, choose to only fuck each other. Do you get the idea of monogamy now? Does it make sence to you now that you've had me around and have tasted the possibilites of a relationship? Get the reason behind sticking with your love? I am trying to have patience with you because this is your first relationship. Regardless if we have declaired it as such or not. At 39 you have never tasted what I have several times at 24. You've got the taste in your mouth and now you want some more but don't know how to ask. JUST FUCKING ASK! Bottom line is I turn cold super fast and I can't take much more. Step up and take me or step down and watch someone do it who will.

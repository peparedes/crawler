So yeah, its been 2 years already since the last time Ive created a post here! time flies! and im still singe, hah! I cant believe it... yes, Im still waitressing and waiting on tables... for 2 years already, and yes im still studying, hopefully a graduating student w/ no flying colours by june or september... Oh I dunno! actually I should study hard this year but Im just too lazy and too tired of studying so I might fail... arrrrrg, I know what ur thinking i cant live w/o complaining! LOL

Anyway the great news is that I went back to the philippines after 7 long years of being here in Spain, I am so proud of me and my sister cuz we really worked hard to make this possible, it was really like a big dream coming true.... but now its like a dream! all blurred that had vanished in one click! hayyyy maybe im just homesick but I really wanna go back soon! theres really no other place like home sweet home... and no matter what happen Im going back with or without my sister.

Lovelife is zero and of course everybody asked me why i havent got a husband or kids at age 27, I actually didnt know what to say... so i said that i wanna travel and see the world and if i was married&nbsp; with kids then i wont be able to do it! haha which is actually true...

Social life wasnt that bad cuz I met up with my old friends, classmates, bestfriends and even met new friends, Ive been with all kinds of ppl actually, i didnt go out that much but ive enjoyed myself... so i cant complain.. i just wish weve stayed more than a whole month cuz it sucks when time flies while ur having fun! 

All in all, it was a GREAT experience that I wanna repeat in the near future... my plan is to go back after 3-5 years cuz its really hard to save!"

I hate my job! Im not happy anymore with my co workers, at first they used to be nice but now after a month I saw their real colour, they arent that nice, they are so mean, especially at weekends!!!!! I HATE BITCHES! 
Today was such a bad day.. its M's fault actually for not showing up! and also the boss's fault cuz he didnt hired any extra waitress for weekends, see, we used to be 6 and today we worked 4! so imagine all the work we had to deal with! I hate it so much when these 2 girls are acting like they are the boss, they get stressed out (of course all of us are really stressed out, duh!!!) and they start to blame me for this and that, and to tell me to do this and that, come on now! I dont have 10 hands! thats what I said to this girl who told me that I shouldnt leave that cake without putting the coffee! but of course I shouldnt but It happened that our boss asked me to do something else, its the boss so I cant say no! and then she went away without listening to what I said and then came back and told me ""nevermind what I said!"" so i freaked out and told her, hello?? cant u see that today M didnt came? today we are less and so it means that we cant do everything right, cant you see all of those tickets lying over there, i was trying to look for the coffee ticket but the boss called me and i had to leave ok? I cant do whatever u guys are asking me to do because I dont have 10 hands!
I felt bad after this, im not used to answer people at work like that with a different tone sounding like Im really angry u know, maybe because i am shy and i dont want to call attention but now I learned that it is required or else people will treat you like shit...
I ignored all of them all night I changed my face with a big frown and went home with a sad face and when I reach the elevator of our apt. I started to cry... I cant help it, im such a crybaby.


Bakit ba ang malas ko talaga sa mga trabaho? malas na nga sa luvlyf pati ba naman sa trabaho malas din? anak ng tokwa naman... sana naman kahit sa isang bagay na lang eh... ok na sana, pero sa 2? parang feeling ko... never ako magiging happy.... as in, never. :(

she didnt say a word and left and I continued with my work, kala ba nila nangangamot lang ako ng tyan ko dun at wala akong ginagawa, pare pareho lang kami kumakayod dun at kung stress sila mas stress ako dahil ako lang ang naiwan sa bar at sila dun lang sila sa dining room... ako ang taga ligpit at taga dala ng mga plato marumi man o malinis, taga dala ng glasses, ng drinks, ng food! lahat lahat!!! at sila? kung minsan nga madalas nagkukwentuhan lang sila dun at inaasa pa sa akin un trabaho nila, hayyyyy...

"event","Ok so Ive been thinking about this for a while... not only because some people were telling me what to do with my life... but because they care, they are right and its for my own good.
When i met mary last week i told her about my jobs and she gave me advice, she always try to cheer me up, she even told me that i cant be a waitress the rest of my life... damn right.
I never went to the university, ok I went for one semester but that was long ago when i was in pinas... I took bs major in social science or something, lol, cant remember! but i gave up! and moved to manila to finish a vocational course in ama clc, cuz i started in ama clc naman talga right after graduating from high school then i moved to Iba i dont know why, lol, i guess my auntie wanted to get rid of me cuz i was a rebel back then so she sent me to Iba, LOL.
Anyway, what Im trying to say is that I need to get a university diploma, I think its really important cuz nobody can take that away from you, im 25 and its not too late or maybe is it? i feel old and going back to study will be a pain in the ass since its really different here... so I thought I'd do a 2 year course of IT since I like computers, lol, and then go directly to university without that 3-day entrance exam! Ive been scared about this entrance exam, I always wanted to do it but I couldnt because I know I will fail so it'll be a waste of time.... umm. 
So Ive been looking for an institute (high school) where they can accept me, theres one right here where my sister went once but I dont feel good because I went once in the nutrition and dietetics course and quit after 3 days! so I dont know yet... theres also 2 more institutes but they're pretty far from home.... ugh, I dont know.. im confused."

"event","*smiles* I have a new journal!!! woohoo! yea, a temporal journal maybe(?) hmmm... first off, a big big big thanks goes to my angel <a href=""http://thursday.garinungkadol.com/"" target=""new"">Thursday Child</a>!!! I love you to pieces, sweetie! hehe, I really missed blogging and since I can't blog anymore on my server I decided to have a journal, I actually have 2, one in blurty.com and this one, but i didnt had the time to fix it cuz i was pretty busy with some other stuff, you know, lol, anyway, my day was really tiring! I woke up around 6 am cuz my sister was watching cartoons! and then I fell asleep while listenin to the radio till 8am, and again my sister was makin noise! but this time with the doorbell so i got up to open the door, she couldnt cuz mom inserted the key, blah! what stupid girl, she didnt know that today and tomorrow its holiday & that she got no classes till wednesday cuz its carnaval/mar-di-gras here so she went to school like a stupid, duh! isnt she dumb? oh well, enough about dumbness, 

after that I tried to sleep again and woke up around 11am and I was surprised cuz the mailman told me that i got a lil package... so right then I knew that it was the sims house party expansion i ordered last week in amazon, man, they're really fast in delivering stuff, I thought that it will arrive here around wednesday - friday, oh well, 

anyway, I uninstalled the sims, saved all of my objects & stuff and then installed the 7 cd's acording to the following order: the sims, livin it up, house party, hot date, vacation & unleashed (has 2 cd's) damn, can u believe that? yea i did it in just one sitting, lol, after that I unzipped the 300+ objects I've downloaded last night & arranged everything...

after that i ate my lunch and started to play, but i realized that everything was soooooo fucking slow, then after a couple of hours of being tired of playing & waiting i decided to went online instead and yea, I took a couple of screenshots of my virtual house, hahahahahha...

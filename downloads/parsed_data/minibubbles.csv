Long story short, friend needed a place to crash for a couple of days, couple of days turned into 6 weeks, and i'm pissed as hell. Suddenly, it's ""Krissy, can you do this?"" ""Krissy, do that"" ""Krissy, do my nails for me"" ""Krissy, wipe my ass for me"", and so on. The last one may have been a slight exaggeration, but I'm not that far off base from what's been happening. This friend took over my room, DESTROYED my room, let her cat help destroy my room, let her cat rip poor Patrick to shreds(poor buddy has gaping wounds on his hips from this psycho fucking cat), but nooooo, I'm not supposed to say a goddamn thing because then I'm being insensitive to people who are disabled. Okay, you're visually impaired, I get it. But I've definitely seen you do a shit ton of things on your own without my help. OH, and btw, I am not going to ""be accountable"" to you about anything. If I wanted to get black out drunk tomorrow, i'd do it. Why? Because I fucking can. I'm an adult, I'm over 21, and I can do whatever the fuck I want. Conference is my time to hang with other brothers. If I'm drunk, so be it. So is everyone else. Don't tell me I'm going to be the most sober person there, and you're going to confiscate my drinks if I have more than two because it might ""interact with my medication"". First off, i've definitely drank while on my meds before and had not one single issue. Secondly, If it hasn't affected my ""professionalism"" yet, I doubt it's going to start to now, whether I'm the president or not. Will I get completely plastered? I doubt it. Anything more than a 6 pack makes me sleepy anyways. I know my goddamn limits. I'm not a fucking child.

My life is MY LIFE. I will do what I want. I've obviously been doing something good if I'm getting really awesome opportunities. I'm going to be assistant stage managing(hopefully I'll be stage managing next fall), I'm working 1 on 1 with the head advisor to turn APO around. I have high ranks in both the marching and concert bands. I've worked my ass off to get these opportunities, and I'll be damned if ANYONE tries to take that from me. I swear so bad I'd make a sailor blush. I say inappropriate things - some that I'm not entirely proud of, but that's besides the point. I'm stubborn as hell. I dye my hair really insane colors(it irks my dad to no end..it's quite amusing). I have a tattoo - two come November. I have piercings - once again, more in november. I don't give a damn about 90% of the political issues out there. I'm not an activist. I'm not a protestor. I don't storm into Fred Upton's office and call him a fucking terrorist to his face. Seriously Nicki, that shit gets you arrested. I volunteer several hundred hours a year FOR FUN. I do a lot that you don't even care about because you're too busy trying to change me. You're too busy trying to manipulate me into thinking the same way you do. If I wanted to be manipulated, I'd be best friends with Olivia again. If I wanted to be manipulated, I'd talk to my sister again. Stop trying to be my mother, I already have one. And stop trying to change me, because it's not going to fucking work. When you go to your apartment tomorrow, You're not fucking coming back here. Do I have anything against the blind? Hell no! Am I completely judgmental to those who are disabled? No! But don't tell me you're super independent, and then do the opposite. I'm sorry being by yourself is depressing, but what part of ""I AM NOT GOING TO BE YOUR FUCKING ROOMMATE"" do you not fucking understand?! People think we're in a relationship because of how you act to me! People think I'm a lesbian. Btw, just because you are does not mean you're going to try and change me into one. I heard your goddamn phone conversation. I happen to like guys. I happen to love redheads and Irish boys, but you're to busy trying to turn me into you to pay attention to anything I even remotely like. The three weeks I have off between semesters is going to be my break from everyone, and if you know what's best, you won't call me.
</vent>

On a good note, I blew this semester out of the water. 3 A's and 1 B! I'm slowly working on getting my design company up and running for my graphic/web design services, and to sell things I create. I started seeing a new doctor who is not a total douche, and I NO LONGER HAVE METABOLIC SYNDROME!!! All my levels are excellent! My thyroid is fine, I don't even have to think about diabetes for a long while, my cholesterol is good, and I'm starting to lose weight finally! I'm finally on the right dosage of my ADHD medication, and I'm actually feeling better than I have in a while! :) The ""roommate"" issue has just been driving me insane for a few weeks because I feel overwhelmed by the situation, and this co-dependency is driving me insane. The only thing allowed to be needy in my life is my cat."

Oh, right, because my stupid HP basically committed laptop suicide. Rawr. $600 dollars I was not ready to spend. 
Oh well, at least the new laptop is pretty awesome. I'm going to eventually get more memory and upgrade it to 8GB(I have 4 in it right now), and a better soundcard/speakers/whatever. Seriously...the stock ones suck balls. They're so quiet and even with the sound turned all the way up, it's hard to hear videos and stuff.

I did buy a new bike so I can start getting my fat ass in shape again. My dad went with me to get it and fixed it all up for me(the tires were kinda low when I got them...but i got it from meijers, so the fact that it was even put together decently was a milestone for that place), and surprisingly, I hadn't forgotten how to ride a bike. Last time I rode one was about 2003ish...right after my grandma died was about when I stopped riding. Partly because the tree that fell on our house the night my grandma died kinda mangled up said bike. It's not a bad bike, I just gotta have my dad lower the seat just a tiny bit so i'm not pushing the pedals with my toes, haha!

OH! and before i forget:
Kalamazoo civic volunteer celebration...I won an award for volunteering over 250 hours for the season, and the whole company of The Drowsy Chaperone got an award for basically being the best show of the season :)

Why? Because my brother and his friend decided to get into a screaming fight at 3am. Yay cops. Yay noise. Yay destroyed telephone and kitchen chair. Right? No. 

And then, after all of it is done, my brother decides to yell at me some more. My voice annoys him. I'm not allowed to talk to him. He can throw whoever he wants out of my mother's house. He's going to punch me. He hates me. Whatever. I hope he fucking kills himself. Extreme? Yes, but you know what? I. am. DONE. Done, done done. My brother and my father make me feel worse about myself than any one incident from someone else. I hate myself because of those two. And i'm going to stand up to my brother any chance I can because if I can stand up to the source of my self-hatred and horrible self esteem, then I can stand up to some dumbass twit who thinks that calling me a ""fat cunt""(excuse the language...I hate that word with a passion) is a way to win an argument. I'm sick of mine and my mother's stuff being destroyed. I'm sick of the yelling. I want to be able to sleep, god dammit! I want my life back. One without my brother. I want to feel good about myself, not cower in fear because he might hit me for calling him an idiot. My father did that bullshit to me for 15 years, and my brother picked right up where my father left off the day my father walk out. i'm 22 fucking years old. I think i've suffered through this shit long enough. 

So, you know what? As much as my brother screams about wanting to kill himself, I hope he fucking does it. Just so I can have a moment of peace. Because i'm sick of always feeling like killing myself for that moment of peace. I'm going to start standing up for myself, because i'm done letting the source of my pain control my life. If he hits me, i'm calling the police. I'll gladly let them photograph the bruises. I'll gladly let them put him in jail. Tonight was the final straw.

So, you know those random moments where a name or phrase will trigger all these bitter feelings? Yeah, definitely happened again. Ugh.

On a side note, started two of the summer classes today, and I should do just fine in them. If I can get my GPA just a tiny bit higher, then I can get into Phi Theta Kappa, and dammit, I will get in there! I want those obnoxious stoles you get when you graduate! haha. I need a 3.5 overall, and I have a 3.3 overall, so if I have a really good semester, I think i can get it up high enough to get that 3.5. If not for the fall, then by the time winter comes around, I should be in it. If I can do this, and graduate with honors, maybe I won't feel quite so stupid. and I can be a bitch and rub it in the faces of everyone who has been patronizing me and treating me different. Sorry, last time I checked, ADHD didn't mean I was retarded. it's an attention deficit, not an intelligence deficit!

Speaking of fraternities, it also looks like I will be the new president of Gamma Phi, and I'm both thrilled and scared shitless. I've wanted this, and I think I can handle it, but I'm basically running a chapter of myself(or 1, depending if KT comes back), and I'm so afraid I won't be able to do this. I hope the advisors and alum are willing to step up and help me. I was all set to just walk away from everything at the end of the semester, and I've been on the fence for so long about it, I might as well just stick it out one more year. Thank god that I've been keeping contact with the field representative, because I know she will bend over backwards to help me. All I know is, i'm going to have a ridiculous amount of littles this year. 

Also, for those interested, I've been posting on my blogspot blog mainly, but I'm also in the process of getting a store set up for all my crafting. Tentative opening date is September, but I might have to push it back to around Black Friday time. I'll try and keep everyone updated, but I will be including a large variety of items, from lotion, to mineral makeup, to simple clothing items(skirts, etc). I'm mainly doing it for some extra money, so i'm hoping it's successful :)"

"event","Well, first, i'm going to start off by sharing the fact that mini-me just got all worked up and while running around my room(now clean and organized! Starting the new year organized = win), ran headfirst into the bottom of my bed. It was fairly amusing. Patrick's in the living room sleeping on top of the cable box with another chunk taken out of his other side this time, and i'm getting a little pissed about it. I have a feeling i know which cat is biting him, but he's now back to how he was a couple of weeks ago. It's quite frustrating. Once i shoo mom's cats out of my room for good, i'm going to try and move him back in here, since i blocked off all his hiding spots.

Other than that, i'm determined to stick to my new year's resolution of getting into shape. I took up zumba via youtube videos, as well as the yoga and aerobics shows on PBS(Wai Lana yoga is on monday/thursday, some other yoga is on tuesday/friday, and a random aerobics show on wednesday). The yoga is fricken intimidating, but i kinda made my way through it. It doesn't help that the one on yesterday started with a headstand. Me doing a headstand? yeah right! Once school starts back up, i also have a 3x's a week cycling class for an hour, so i'm getting a little bit of everything in during the week, so i'm figuring something that to work. The zumba is my favorite right now, for sure, although the ones that the shuffle on my playlist picked for me were upper arm and ab heavy, so i'm kinda sore right now. 

If anyone wants to keep up, i do have various trackers on medhelp.org. My profile is http://www.medhelp.org/personal_pages/show/1432720. The one i'm using the most on there is the exercise one, but once i get back to a normal schedule, i will probably use more of them. I am keeping a little journal on the exercise tracker, so if you wanna see how i'm doing, that's definitely the best one to check. :)

Besides all of that, i'm finishing out my last week of break with two rehearsals for Friday...myself and a friend are performing for the Board of Education @ Kalamazoo Valley Community College. I also have tech week @ the Civic, starting sunday and going through the end of January. Starting in February, i have Showboat rehearsals, and as soon as i hear back from Comstock High School, i should start rehearsals for the pit orchestra for Little Shop of Horrors, and then Hairspray, which will take place this summer. I'll definitely be busy, but it's doing something i love, so it doesn't bother me."

All month, i've tried to get into the christmas spirit, and i can't.
I can't even bring myself to listen to christmas music. it just makes me cry.
there's no tree up this year, no cookie making, none of the traditions we normally do.
Instead, i get to listen to my brother stomp around the house and kick at the cats, saying he's gonna kill them if mom doesn't get rid of them. 
Instead, i get told by my brother's friend that i need to go out and get a job, and stop relying on my brother to support us, when i ask my brother for nothing.
All mom talks about anymore is moving to florida, basically leaving me to fend for myself.
Merry christmas, huh? :(

Miss you, grandma. things haven't been the same since you died, our family's falling apart. I know you couldn't control the cancer, but i hate that quitting smoking couldn't even help save you. I feel like i'm lost right now, i don't even have you to go to because you're not here anymore. I miss you. A lot.

He'll jump up on me for a couple of minutes, but the slightest wrong move and he jumps back down. His fur is still kind of on the greasy side, and luckily the hair on his hip is starting to come back in as well(one of mom's cats decided it'd be perfectly okay about a week ago to bite his hip and rip out a huge ass chunk of fur. It looked so gross for a couple days, but it's since scabbed over and the scab fell off yesterday). He's eating and drinking, and starting to put some of his weight back, so things are starting to look better! :)"

"event","Since i know a few people on my friendslist have cats, i have a couple questions.

Long story short, my mom's cats(2 males and 2 females) have been beating the crap out of my year and a half male, Patrick, and my 8 month old male, mini-me. Mini-me seems to be mostly unaffected by it, and can hold his own against the males. But Patrick is very, very timid about it all. He practically lives under my dresser, only coming out when he knows for sure that i'm in my room. If i'm not in my room, the males will wait on or under my bed for him to think it's safe and come out, and then jump him. I was able to coax him out about 3 days ago, and his fur was very greasy and he's very very thin. I've been keeping him in our large cat carrier with food and water, and then letting him out at night in the bathroom with the door closed. Is there something that i can give him to get his weight up? He's been shoveling food down like crazy, but he's still very bony and scrawny, and i'm wondering if there's a way to speed the process up a little so he's feeling a bit better? I can't afford to take him to the vet, and i'm afraid if i do, they'll call animal control on me for abuse because he's so thin.

On another note, before all of this started, when he would come out, he would spray on everything. and by everything, i mean EVERYTHING. If it's not attached to the walls/ceiling, or hanging in the closet, he's gotten to it. I did a little bit of searching around online, and i can only really narrow it down to stress, but of course, now i have cat smelling possessions. I can get it out of my clothing fairly well with mixing vinegar in with the detergent, but things like my suitcase, i'm having issues. Febreeze doesn't really do anything, and i've noticed it's starting to get into the carpet as well. 

What's the best way to get the urine smell out of fabrics and plastic items? I thought that maybe a bleach/water mix would work, but we tried that on the walls and it did nothing. My mom thought maybe using the stuff that gets deer urine out of stuff might work?

Is there also something that we can use in the carpet to take the smell out of the carpet as well? i've noticed that places like the corners and under my desk is where they'll go, and when i talked to the apartment manager, they did say the previous tenant had several cats as well, so i'm thinking that's where they would go. 

thanks guys! i really want to get my buddy back to normal without making my mom have to give up her cats."

And i'm not sure if i'm just being jealous, or what. Like...i don't feel jealous, in fact, most of the time when they're bitching on facebook, i just laugh to myself because i don't have to deal with it. but...i dunno. i feel like i'm going to end up being that person who is going to be 30, still single, and childless. That i'm just going to end up having 30 cats instead. i mean, for fucks sake, i haven't even dated and i'm 21. i'm getting so close to possibly having a boyfriend, and i'm terrified of that part, and now i'm freaking out about not having kids. Ugh, why do i fucking hate myself for being responsible? for not getting myself knocked up at 15 or 16? I look at my friends, and i can't even compare. They've all dated. I hear about their sexual escapades constantly. they think nothing of being called cute, or beautiful, while I cling to those words like I'll never hear them again. I've never heard the words ""I love you"". I've never been told that i mean something to someone. i've been asked out on ONE date, and that wasn't until of july of this year. i've never been asked if i wanted to be someone's girlfriend. I don't get the cutesy text messages or facebook wall posts. Hell, i don't even get to make the cutesy facebook statuses about how so-and-so is everything, and how much i love them, and have it all covered with hearts and crap. I'm just the one who gets hit on by creepy old guys at the bar at everyone else's amusement. I'm the one that gets set up with a 26 year old who has a mental breakdown when i reject his flirting because i'm not interested, and he becomes the campus creeper. OR, i end up being the one who is only pursued because the guy is a chubby chaser. I'm the one who gets my phone constantly called for 2 days because some jerk backed me into a corner and made me give him my phone number. Sure, i was able to give him a fake name and address, but i couldn't give him a fake number because he wouldn't take no for an answer, and forced me to pull up my phone information and show it to him. I'm the one who is told that my not having a boyfriend means I'm a lesbian. I'm the one who they ""just want to be friends"" with. And now...now i FINALLY get some attention from a guy, and i'm terrified. How this relates to me not having any kids, i don't know, but whatever. Maybe being a hopeless romantic is just getting the best of me. i'll probably never know.

The new organic shampoo i got gives my hair epic volume. i kinda love it. if i had waited another hour or so, the blonde would have been brighter, but i'm kinda impatient, and the dye that i'm going to use is pretty concentrated, so i don't think it'll be too bad.

Phase two: in progress.
basically, covering the blonde with pink hair dye :)

Phase three: on hold until i can find a pair of scissors.
Trimming my hair so it's not so weird. the lady who trimmed it last time basically gave me a mullet, and it grew out weird."

"event","omg, excellent yard sale finds today!

I found a household/estate sale on my way home from work today, and decided to check it out. Just so happened there was a plastic clarinet for 25 dollars. It definitely needs some work...new pads and corks, and the keys are tarnished. I'm not sure if the keys are nickel plated or silver plated, though. I'm going to do some online research and see what i can find about it. It's definitely an older clarinet, but if it sounds good, i would be interested in using it for a backup clarinet. Then, i wandered the sale some more and found a metal clarinet for 15 dollars. I have been trying to find one for AGES. it needs new pads, and a lot of cleaning done to it, but it is going to look beautiful when i'm done with it! i'm so excited about working on this, i think it's going to be a great investment. The sale runs tomorrow too, and i'm really tempted by a mandolin that's there, so i might have to go back and see if it's there tomorrow."

"event","long time, no post. i know, i know. forgot my damn password again. give me about a week, i'll probably forget it again, lol. 

things have been insane the last few months. Barely made it through the semester, although i did end up with a 3.0 GPA. Bad thing though, i had to drop two classes, and financial aid terminated my loans. I'm fighting that at the moment, because i didn't have insurance to go into the doctor, and when i finally did say screw it and go in, i had a large bill that i'm STILL trying to pay off. The head of financial aid doesn't believe me, i can hear it in her voice, but i'm gonna talk to the president of the college and see what he says. I couldn't help that i was slammed with pneumonia, the flu, bronchitis, and more colds than i could deal with all right after each other. Heck, i still hadn't gotten over swine flu when that all started, and my immune system was so bad. It's almost the middle of june now, and i'm JUST NOW feeling healthy again.

I was re-elected into my position in APO, which i'm happy for. I originally was going to be the vice president of membership, but a last minute nomination for president kinda threw off the order, haha. My running mate is bitter, and trying to sabotage me already. on top of that, i may actually have two positions come fall. Our VP of service can no longer have her position, so if our current membership vp takes that position, membership and fellowship will be combined into one position: aka, me. i kinda hope that's how it'll work out, because the positions are so similar, i wouldn't really be adding much to my current duties.

i have a new-ish job now! well, two. the first one is watching an elderly man during the day, but what was originally supposed to be filling in has turned into watching him almost all day, AND watching the two year old great-grandchild. It's frustrating, for sure. The second job isn't quite as frustrating, though. I'm now a pampered chef consultant! i love doing the food demos, and i've been getting SO much better at cooking :)

Learned about 3 weeks ago not to fall asleep on the beach. I'm STILL healing from that sunburn. I had second degree burns and blisters on roughly 60% of my body, and i got a nice lecture from my doctor about not going into the er. had i gone in, i would have been admitted into the burn unit :/ I'm still peeling a little, but not as bad as i was. my legs, which didn't burn as bad as the rest of me are just now starting to peel, haha. I ended up burning my chest, shoulders, neck, back, arms, legs, face, and neck. However, i now look like a mexican because i'm ridiculously tan from it. guess it beats looking like an albino child, lol.

Other than that, i have a wordpress blog that i set up a while ago. i'm not really doing much with it, venting mostly, though. it's here: http://kristinelb.wordpress.com/ people are more than welcome to comment on the posts i have, although eventually i think i want to turn it into an icon journal, once i get back into making those"

"event","I don't feel like myself anymore. i don't know what to do...I'm always sick. I'm always tired. All i have wanted to do for like a month is cry. I'm hyper sensitive to everything...if it's not upsetting me, it's pissing me off so much i want to punch things. i got in a fight this morning with my mom because i didn't want to go to court. and then my brother had to jump in and act like he's so much better than me, and it just pissed me off more. I'm apparantly nothing but a fatass, i'm being kicked out because i don't wanna go to court(i don't see where confirming a conversation that happened will do anything since it's already gonna be decided what's gonna happen. It's 3 vs 2, and they snuck the stuff in the lease anyways, so a conversation isn't gonna mean shit in court), and i just wanna curl up in a ball and die. i can't focus on anything. I have no motivation anymore, and i don't know what's going on...I don't wanna say i might be depressed, or anything along those lines, because then i'm just being a victim. I bitch to all my friends about everything else, that i don't want to bother them with something as trivial as this. I'm sure my mom and brother are bitching right now about how lazy i am, and how much of a waste of space i am...at this point, i'm wondering if it just wouldn't be easier to kill myself and save them the trouble of having to deal with me, since i'm apparantly such a horrible person who can't even function enough to finish anything. 

i don't understand why i can't balance everything. i used to be able to balance school, work, apo, and band, and now that i don't have my job anymore, it's like it all crumbled to pieces. i can barely keep up with school, and i'm so frustrated with apo that i try to back off on it, but i can't because i keep getting assigned to committees and projects. i have a little this semester, and everytime i get ready to hang out with him, i'm down sick. I always feel like i'm running on little sleep. i'm always down sick. we're in the 9th week or so in the semester, and i feel like i've been healthy for one of those weeks(i started the semester with a cold. then a sinus infection. then the flu. back to the sinus infection. back to the cold. another sinus infection. Now? a double ear infection and another cold.). i thought spring break would help me, but i was so sick for the whole week i couldn't even enjoy it. every weekend there's something going on. i never get to relax. i feel like i no longer have a support system, and i feel like everyone hates me. Hell, i think even my cat hates me most of the time. we're moving again this weekend and i have no motivation to pack my stuff(i'm sure that's because i don't want to, and i'm sick of moving). i keep getting a victim label anytime i try and talk about what's going on. god forbid i have any problems...i'm just trying to get attention. I hate my brother, my mom's moving up the list right now. i have no family i can go to...i cut all ties with my sister, i have no grandparents. I can't talk to my cousins cuz it'll get back to my mom and i don't wanna listen to that mess. I feel like ever since i started standing up for myself that it's caused more problems than good. and i know i should be proud of myself for not being everyone's doormat, but i'm definitely not feeling it right now. i just feel miserable...i feel worthless. i don't feel like i deserve to be happy because i feel like i did something wrong. 

I hate this. i wish i knew what was going on, and how to fix it. and i wish i knew why after a little over a year i'm feeling suicidal again. i seriously haven't felt like this since last spring when i wasn't taking classes and everything went to shit."

Other than that, the usual. More APO drama. one of the new actives started a petition to get olivia's little in the chapter. our president said she was going to overturn our 'no' votes, we have section staff coming in next week for the investigation on this. We didn't do anything wrong, but it just sucks. Oh, and apparently phillip and julie stole me from olivia. and how julie ruined everything. how olivia ""did so much for me"". All she did was piss me off. i only faked a stomach virus for 3 weeks last spring so i wouldn't have to deal with her. oh, and then there's the whole clique thing. fun fun fun.

The one good thing with this is i'm getting a little! I'm so so soooo excited :D i also am possibly going to be the Vice President of membership next year also! Phillip's going to help me write my 'campaign' for it. so there are some good things going. it's just the drama wants to make me choke people. I'm on the gamma phi day committee to help greg, and then i got stuck on the alumni formal committee, but phillip's gonna help me with that.

I'm getting a new domain in february when i have the money(i think i might cough up the extra money for 2 or 3 years of hosting, so i don't have to keep renewing it every year, but i'm not too sure yet.). I'm hoping to get my personal site back up, as well as my own trading card game based on instrumental music, drum corps and marching bands specifically. the places i frequent in the TCG world love the idea, so i'd love to see the site take off. I searched a few spots, and it looks like the one i want, melodic-minor, is avaliable as a .net, which is great! if it's still there in feb, i'll grab it. if not, i'll see if i can think of something else :)

on a random rant, i'm super sad that i can't find a lot of retro style dresses in plus sizes :( the closest i can find is like...a size 14. i wear an 18-20, depending on the cut.

There's pics on my facebook from this weekend ^_^ best weekend ever, aside from the releasing of a years worth of repressed anger. it sucked for olivia, but was hilarious to everyone else.


Oh yeah, and i'm finally over being sick! what they thought was seasonal flu, actually was swine flu, so it def. explains why i was so sick for 3 weeks."

"event","omg, insanely crazy week.

and it's only thursday. 

Got called a cunt by jacob on tuesday, slapped him, got the shit beat outta me by jacob for 'hurting him'

last night, jacob got kicked out for stealing my mom's car, and robert punched him after he tried to attack robert. jacob runs to the cops, trying to get robert in trouble, and it failed. now there's drama involving that.

and we're getting evicted from here(found that out on monday). so we're gonna go stay with my aunt for a couple weeks, but we might be moving into a really nice house soon. i'm not thrilled, but whatever."

i really hope he didn't like...break my nose or something. cuz i'll be kinda pissed."

on another note, i'm getting a new phone! a red blackberry pearl, at that ^_^. i was gonna upgrade to one eventually through my plan, but with me and sprint fighting(they were messing with my bill big time. changing the amount of what i owed from 100 to 300 on different months), i kinda just decided not to. well, mom needed to get a plan and a phone for her new job, so she got a family plan, and got me my blackberry! it gets here on tuesday ^__^"

I don't know if this has anything to do with everyone being so excited about my asshole brother getting a girlfriend. i feel pathetic...i can't get a guy, but my brother, probably one of the most horrible people out there, can. i don't understand.

I don't wanna be alone for the rest of my life...:("

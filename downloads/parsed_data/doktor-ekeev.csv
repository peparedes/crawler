"event","Well, it is obvious that I am not such huge fan of the journal thing, as I cannot be bothered to use it.  But also, it has been, in my department, awfully busy.

And now, if only to make things more complicated at this moment, I have been offered job.  As department head, which here I am not, and it I think maybe I would be awfully stupid to say no.

But it is in San Diego, and that is a very long way away."

"event","I watched baseball yesterday, All-Star game.  Baseball makes me wince.  Pitchers are among stupidest athletes, I think.  Do you <i>see</i> what the elbows look like in curveballs?  Strain on ligaments?  Is crazy.  I have performed Tommy John surgery before, several, and is not difficult to see why.

Baseball is not a sport I have ever played, though I suppose is fun to watch.  I went to several major league games, in Atlanta, and more than several Durham games and more than that UNC games.  Treated UNC players, of course, some.  

But that is not point.  Point is pitching is dumb, curveballs are dumber.  So says the orthopedist.

I have ACL repair later.  Knees are my favorite.

I played Monday, my wrist only was a little sore, and I have game tomorrow too.  It healed quickly, I am glad.  I go crazy when I cannot get my hockey fix.  And now I should quit dwelling on Psych case and get back to my own."

"event","So it is fourth today, which probably just means that tomorrow I will be seeing several wristbones that are no longer attached to hands, and today will be array of sprained joints and fractures.  Plus ones already I saw in clinic, of course.

But is ok, I will see tonight Batman.  Movie, not real Batman, because I live in New Jersey and not Gotham City.

But Fourth of July, I remember some time ago, my last year in school in Moscow, we had become friends with some American students and they took us down to Vykino, down in south of city, to American Chamber celebration.  Because there are many Americans in Moscow, and celebration for Day of Independence there is biggest in world, outside of course of U.S.  What I remember the most is that they had American beer for cheap, and fireworks over lake were very nice.

<lj-cut text=""private"">
And American boys are very good kissers, something I was reminded of on several other Independence Day celebrations.  I do not know, maybe fireworks are romantic, yes?

And I hate that on this computer in office, there is no cyrillic...</lj-cut>"

"event","I don't understand you other departments, who have just one case every now and then so that you get bored.  Here in orthopedics, we do not get bored.  Every day are broken bones and torn tendons and lots of x-rays.  If you are all so not busy, why don't you come do my paperwork?

Still, good week, I think.  We played well on Monday, tied, but is still a point in standings.  On next Monday will be anniversary of my being here for one year.  I have kept to myself, mostly, but that seems to be changing, and is certainly not a bad thing <strike>at all</strike>.  These journals are funny, I think, and it occurs to me that I could write in Russian, in mine, and you would all have no idea what I am saying.  But maybe you would be amused by such strange letters.  

Maybe some other time.

Dr. Keifer, do you have biopsy results yet?"

"event","There was amputation surgery this morning, which I like least of all I do as doctor.  I remember when I was studying, maybe third or fourth year as medical student, I was so squeamish...sure that never would I be able to do those, and maybe would go into cardiology or neurology or the like.  But here I am, orthopedics, and I often perform such operations.  And of course, is for the benefit of patient, but give me good ACL-MCL-lateral meniscus tear any day.

But is quiet afternoon if no consults, I will be able to work in charts.  I think I deserve medical student to do charts for me.  Is no one yet on rotation in orthopedics?  

And of course is Thursday night, hockey night for rec league, and we have game.  Should not be challenge, team we play is second worst in league, but I like to skate after long surgery during day.

Return to work."

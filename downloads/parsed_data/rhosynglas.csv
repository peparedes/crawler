Not sure why I can't be Tifa but I'll take comfort in knowing that if I had answered ""Gun and Claw"" instead of ""Longsword"" when I chose my weapon, I would have been Vincent. Because, you know, its kind of cool to be Sephiroth's daddy. :-P

Your word is BUGGER. You are generally quite<br>restrained, but sometimes your anger or<br>frustration come to the surface and it all<br>comes out. Yet you somehow can't stop sounding<br>polite, despite it all.

"event","But sometimes I wonder if its really worth playing anymore. The game itself is a lot of fun but the people hoave gotten so immature. Some of them are being outright mean. I absolutely hate one of the leaders of a guild we ally with for Molten Core and I'm seriously considering never raiding with them again after I get my last two set pieces. I don't want to cause drama and I don't have screen shots or anything I can prove this with, so I'm thinking I'll just save the $15 a month. My account expires sometime in December. I'll have to look into that. There's no particular reason for me to renew it right away anyway."

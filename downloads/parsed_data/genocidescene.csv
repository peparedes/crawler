"event","Grief lasts forever. If it doesn' t then it's not true grief. I know it sounds hard to believe, but once you stop fighting it and accept it as part of you, it's not such a bad thing. It'll still hurt. It'll still tear you apart, but in a different way. A more intimate way. You can use it. It's yours. It belongs to you. But the pain of grief... the pain you're feeling now doesn't last forever. It can't. It hurts too much. You can't live with that much pain - not forever. Your body can't take it. Your mind can't take it. It knows that if you don't get over it, it's going to kill you. And it doesn't want that. So it makes you get over it. Getting over it doesn't mean forgetting it, it doesn't mean betraying your feelings, it just means reducing the pain to a tolerable level, a level that doesn't destroy you. I know that right now the idea of getting over it is unimaginable. It's im possible. Inconceivable. Unthinkable. You don't want to get over it. Why should you? It's all you've got. You don't want kind words, you don't care what other people think or say, you don't want to know how they felt when they lost someone. They're not you, are they? They can't feel what you feel. The only thing you want is the thing you can't have. It's gone. Never coming back. No one knows how that feels. No one knows what it's like to reach out and touch somone who isn't there and will never be there again. No one knows that unfillable emptiness. No one but you. You don't want anything. You want to die. But life won't let you. You're all it's got."

June 18, 1989 - November 15, 2006


""Kentucky State Police Trooper Michael Stotts inspects a Mercury Cougar in which brothers Michael A. Ramsay, 19, and Samuel O. Ramsay, 17, of Richmond, died Wednesday. The vehicle hydroplaned on a wet U.S. 25 north of Richmond and turned sideways in front of an on-coming vehicle, KSP Trooper Anthony Gatson said. Heavy rain was falling at approximately 4:30 p.m. when the accident occurred, Gatson said. The driver of the other vehicle, Tyler P. King, 24, of Richmond, was transported to St. Joseph East in Lexington for treatment of multiple injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening.""

we had some amazing times together. i will never forget algebra class last year, or the time you made me drink beer until i devolped a liking to it. when you and james picked me up to smoke a couple bowls, and i had to hold the wheel while james took his hits. when i saw you at the movie theater after you had just gotten back from florida, and you gave me a packet of grape jelly from mcdonalds as a souvenier. when you told me you thought i was pretty. when you came and picked me up in your station wagon and told me i wasn't aloud to smoke in your car, and made me stick my head out the window, but the second i was done you rolled up all the windows and lit one up yourself while laughing. when you made fun of me for being a vegetarian, but then told me you loved me right afterwards. when you called me a pussy for getting teeth pulled. when i gave you shit for dropping out of high school, but all you said was ""albert einstein was a highschool dropout!"". when you pretended to run over my dog. when you decided that you didn't want to be in class, so you had me distract the teacher while you jumped out the window. when i showed you my room and the first thing you did was rip a picture of jenny mcknight off the wall, because you hated her. you were absoloutly amazing samuel, and i love you so much. i miss you more than words can describe, but i hope wherever you are you're smoking a big fattie and drinking a cold beer, and laughing with michael."

"event","i was in the car with my parents  last night, when my phone started ringing. i didn't reckognize the number, but i answered it anyway. it was lindsey, crying so hard that i couldn't understand, i tried as hard as i could to understand the words she was trying to tell me, and finally when i comprehended i learned...

samuel is dead.

it didn't hit me at first, i hung up the phone, sat there and looked around and then suddenly broke down. it hurt so bad, and it doesn't feel real, i just hung out with him a couple days ago, he's only 17. how could it even be possible that samuel could be gone? i called his phone, i guess i expected him to answer and tell me it was all a big joke, but i only got his voicemail. it still doesn't make sense, i can't focus on it or i'll start crying. lindsey, tisha, and me were the 3 closest people to him at school, and now he's gone. i miss him so much."

"event","well I was a loner until there were no friends left. and before someone offered me drugs, you know I was straightedge. and everyone's quit till you offer them a cigarette. before we learn our lessons, let's see how bad things can get. and I'll drink myself to death, or at least I'll drink myself to sleep. chainsmoke my way through the gaps in between my aspirations and my apathy. as we drive past the last exit to home I am waving goodbye. and I might be sleeping in the ditch tonight, but it's alright, because whiskey is my kind of lullaby. I was sober all morning until I woke up this afternoon. and before someone offered me a job I was gonna get one soon. and everyone in this town sleeps till the calendar collides with June. before the booze wears off, let's take another shot or two. and I'll drink myself to death, or at least I'll drink myself to sleep. chainsmoke my way through the gaps in between my aspirations and my apathy. as we drive past the last exit to home I am waving goodbye. and I might be sleeping in the ditch tonight, but it's alright, because whiskey is my kind of lullaby."

"event","school in itself is a real fucking bummer. since they changed the schedule to where you have to take 6 classes a day instead of, 4 the day goes by a lot slower, an at the end, i'm usually really exhausted. some my teachers bring up logan and brennnan and ask how logan was doing as a chef, and then i have to explain to them that ethan's the chef until they remember him. i hate ms. phillips too, she couldn't be more of a bitch. i'm looking foward tot he weekend. my parents are going out of state, and hopefully something cool will go down. i'm pretty ripped right now, waiting to go to ground effects, and meet tyler and lauren, i can't wait till school is over."

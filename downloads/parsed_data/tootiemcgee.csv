But it is still better than living in a dorm. Next weekend josh and I's parents are coming down. They are flying into houston on Thursday and leaving monday moring. I should already be on my way to work this morning... but for some reason I have clocked in late all week... so why stop now right? Josh is leaving in about 3 1/2 weeks. Im starting to go through the emotional shit already. It all started when we had to go to the pre deployment brefing last week. We bought new furniture...couch, loveseat, recliner all microswade if that is even how it is spelled. We also got a king size sleigh bed with two nightstands and a long dresser with a mirror at the top and a tall dresser for josh's clothes... and a big oval mirror that the guy through in for free. The total cost of a saturday of just looking around came to $4,000. Lets just say, Josh and i are really bad about spending our money lol. i'll post pictures later this weekend. Work is going good. I love all the girls there! we have been going to curves a lot after work... well i havn't been in the last few weeks because i have been spending a lot of time with josh before he leaves. all my classes are doing relaly good. I'm kicking ass in all of them. Straight A's let me tell you! and we have had our first major exams... I can't believe how muuch easier it is to not be in a dorm... lol I have my own time... with no one to bother me. not like i didn't love to see alyssa everyday. But I am the type that i need my own time.  But anywase i'm soupposed to be at work by 8am and i havn't even blow dryed my hair yet! lol oops... and it is 7:47! Later gators!"

"event","So, It is Friday night, I just got home from work... and Josh still isn't home. :( I think we are going out to dinner tonight, I really don't feel like cooking anything. The other night we went to Spirits West, I ordered a Margarita and they actually served me! She asked for my ID and I told her I dind't have it... she said, ""oh that's alright"" and winked. lol YAHOO!  So, My birthday is coming up soon... I'm excited, I dont know what we are going to do for it yet... but i'm sure something will come up. On christmas eve we are heading to San Antonio, TX for the Detroit Lions game. I can't wait to go for a walk on the riverwalk. I LOVE THAT PLACE!! Work is going great! I love all the girls there!!! They are all so goofy and silly. Fran said that she is going to send me to Expanded Duty class, So i will be a certified Dental Assistant with Expanded Duty. That just means that I can do a lot more like cealants and stuff. She also wants me to be trained in Pros and in Hygiene too! Gosh, moving down here was the best decision of my life!!!!I found the job of my dreams, and i'm married to the best man in the entire world! I got my last paycheck and they already raised my pay by $1.00 two weeks early becuase Fran said that I am doing really good... I get a raise again in two weeks! YAHOO!!! Things were kinda tight when I didn't have a job. We had plenty of money, but just were limited on buying things. The army pays like shit, let me tell you! We don't have to pay any bills except our cell phones, cable and internet... but still... $720 every two weeks wasn't really cutting it. But now that i'm making an extra $600 every two weeks too.... we are happy campers! Alright, josh just walked in the door... gotta go!"

+ I LOVE my job sooo much, there isn't a day I get up and not want to be there!

-by the time I get home it is dark out

+my checks rock my socks!

+I start school in Jan

-I have to go back to BJAHC to see a military doctor again tomorrow. NOT EXCITED! Lets just get all this shit over with, PLEASE?

+I went and spent Thanksgiving with my sister in Missouri. We also got to see Dick and Mare. I'm glad they are doing good. 

+Josh and I had a lot of fun. I havn't seen my sister in Five years (well except the 10 min last year in GR)

-My sister and I bawled our eyes out when I had to leave. I miss her so much, It makes me so sad just to think about us not being able to see eachother all the time. We are so much alike now. Everyone says we look like twins when we go places. Well except she is still as skinny as a stick lol 

+When josh leaves for Afgan, I may be moving to Missouri to live with my sis while he is gone for a year. my sister pretty much got me a job at a dental office... and I would be going to the college near by and be saving $700 a month on housing. 

-Josh almost drove through the house when the breaks went out totally on Bonnie. good thing that cement stopper was there... :)

-Josh got news he could be leaving for Iraq now instead of Afgan and they wouldn't be leaving until summer :( The sooner he leaves... the sooner he gets back... and please no iraq!!

+ We are looking for property in TL in the next few months. We are working on the blueprints for my dad to start everything. We are building a house big enough to live there the rest of our lives!! FUCK YEAH! We are sooo excited. We will get $350,000 from the army to build... and this next year when josh is gone we will be making $50-55,000. So, I know everything will be alright. 

+we are getting our christmas tree this weekend!!! We are going on the hay ride and everything!!! my neighbors Tamera and Adam are going with us. I love them two! 

I wish mandee would come home soon.. I miss her!

"event","I think I just had a pretty big breakdown... I have just had a lot of stress on me lately. None of it is really at all bad... It is just things I want to get done, and things that are happening in my life. It all started when I got a text message from Josh. Which is really uncommon because he is in the field, and can't have his phone. It said ""I will love you forever"" and that is when i just started crying away. I feel much better now... But it just all sucks because Josh is gone, and I havn't seen him for 3 weeks.... I really miss him. I have lost 10 lbs since he has been gone. I just don't eat. Food don't even sound good. I know I will have to deal with this sooner or later for a whole year. But right now is not the time for him to be missing out because of the ""field"". I have to get school all stiuated. I have my classes, and my schedule... but i just have to talk to my advisor still. I have no idea when that is possible since I work everyday from 8am till 5pm and then I have night classes and online classes. I guess if it gets stressful, I don't have to work. Money isn't the issue at all, it is more along the line of I have been wanting to do this my WHOLE life. So, I start my job tomorrow moring!!!!! I am a dental assistant now! FUCK YEAH! I'm kinda nervous about all of this just because I am taking apon something that is going to be a BIG part of my life now. We WERE going to come home and surprise everyone for Christmas, but now, because of my job, we can't. We are still going to our Lions Game that we have tickets for on Christmas Eve. I am sooo excited about that! It is in San Antonio, TX. We have two nights stay at a really nice hotel and we are bringing maggie with too.  we have matching jerseys and everything!! Josh is leaving so very soon, and it is one of the hardest things to deal with. I don't think even being away from him for a year is as hard as saying goodbye. I know he will be safe and come home alright. But It isn't easy going to meetings every few weeks where you have to fill out funeral arrangements and sign things in case something does happen. Everytime I think about this, I cry. Just like right now. I guess it is good for me to let my tears come out... but at the same time it just keeps re-bottling up inside. I need to go to bed."

I was sooo fricken excited!!!!!! I GOT A JOB!!!! Well then, I go to the job Yesterday, and I COUDLN'T STAND IT!!!! It was sooo sick in there!!!! I wanted to puke prolly a total of 10 times! It was sooo dirty. They never even trained me! I thought that I was going to go through some training or someting, NOPE. I walked in, I saw the menu, and they gave me a menu with all the symbols they use... yeah, symbols. Like Q means Cajun French Fries... They stuck me on 5 tables my first day! I had no fuckin clue what the stuff on the menu was. SERIOUSLY, southern food is strange here!!! Like their Ruben is something TOTALLY different from how we make ours in MI! I did actually really good for the most part. I only had a few messups, and the people in the back had many. GEEZ... this one time this lady ordered this melt and it came with cooked onions on it. She told me to cut the onions and I looked at her strange, but wrote it on the slip right in front of her. Well, when her meal came, Her onions were cut like she asked. She got sooo pissed and started talking some Cajun shit to me about how she wanted them CUT. I was like ""THEY ARE CUT!!!"" And she was like, ""when I say cut, that means I don't want any!!"" I just looked at her and rolled my eyes. And the big greasy fat lady in the back cookin started yellin at me!  I made about $75 in tips... so, I made really good money. BUT THERE IS NO WAY I'M GOING BACK!  This morning I was supposed to work, and I didn't show up. They never called me, so I'm figuring that is why they prolly have had a HELP WANTED sign in the window since I have been down here. Well, In the time I was waitressing, I saw this lady that had a nametag on that worked at a Dental Office. So, I told her I really would LOVE to work there, and how I have had a lot of experience in a Dental Office. She told me they were seeking an Assistant. She said I would be perfect for the job, and that today was my lucky day because she is the one that hires there! So,she told me at 3 to come fill our an app, so i did... and she said she will give me a call prolly after the holidays. She said that they will train me as an assistant, and I will have a certification and everything. I would be making at least $25,000 a year, And still get to go to school!!! FUCK YEAH!!! This is everything I have ever wanted!!!! I seriously think that god sent me to BJ's so I could meet this lady. This is one of them 'EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON' things. She could have sat at  So, since i'm not going to go back to BJ's, then I am unemployed (again). But until I get the job at the Dental Office, I'm going to work, as of the second week in Dec, at a daycare. So, Now i'm off to Patti's, I'm going to see if Kayte and Mandee want to go to EL GIROs with me tonight!!!! YUMM!!!!!!"

I don't think I will pay only $10 for going to college... Oh yeah, and prolly parking tickets. :) Josh is going to be so happy everything is getting done fianlly. It took me a good 3 months to find a fricken job! Brock called the other night, I miss him soooo much! He is coming here soon! I can't wait!!!!! He needs a break from his job and Muskegon in general. Sarah and Mike are staying with us for Thanksgiving!!! YAHOO! But we will be gone two nights at my sisters in Missouri. My mom is coming down in December with my little brother! I guess my dad is going hunting to Tennessee again, and my mom wanted to come here... So they got their plane tickets, and I can't wait for them to get here!!!!! I accidently called Adam Dake again today. I do it about every two weeks or so. His name is at the top of my contacts list, and it always seems to call him. He always has to call me back, and I tell him it was my damn phone again. At least we get to chat! :) I have lost 6 lbs since Josh has been gone.

"event","So, As I'm coming home from taking Maggie to the vet, I get pulled over on base. The geeky MP came up to my car and says, ""Hello Mrs., Do you know why I pulled you over?"" I was like, ""No"". And he said ""Because you were doing 28 in a 20."" I said, ""How could I possibly be doing 28 over a speed bump?"" (NOTE: these speed bumps aren't like the ones in MI. They are about a half foot off the ground and if you go 10mph over them, your car will bottom out, seriously) He says ""well Mrs, can I have your military license and Regular License and Registration and Proof of Insurance?"" WTF!!!!!!! If I were to get pulled over back in MI, They would be like: License and Registration please. BUT NO!!!!! They had to ask for like 20 million things! So, he goes to his vehicle, and comes back and says he is giving me a warning. I told him thank you for giving me a warning for going over a speed bump. He looked at me, and I took off while he was still standing at my window. He knew for sure that I was NOT going 28 in a 20 OVER A FUCKING SPEED BUMP THAT IS AS BIG AS THE BODY OF AN MP IN THE ROAD! He also knew that if he gave me a ticket, he would be an idiot. MP's are not real police. They are dummies that don't even do anything in the fricken army but carry around guns and ride in their cars all day. All they do in Iraq is teach the Iraqi MP's how to be better police. SERISOULY, that is what they are really doing over there. Stupid Huh?"

Yesterday, My friend Patti and I went to a bunch of yard sales. Well, they were really PCSing yardsales... So, they had like nice things... and not just junk. But anyway, I bought the coolest thing ever!!!! A PALM TREE!!!! YAHOO!!! well, It was in a pot, and the guy said that if I brought the pot back to him, then he would put the other palm trees in his yard in it for me! I WAS SOOO EXCITED!!! So, Here are my Palm Trees....They are both about 3 feet tall. Josh is going to be sooo excited! We have been wanting some ever since we got down here, but they are really expensive, and I got all these, and the pots for $10! And he even gave me soil and 20 lbs of birdseed for the bird feeders that I don't have yet. :)

Also, This weekend Patti and I went to Ruby D's. It is this little flea market. We bought 8 cupboard doors. They are really heavy and prolly antique. We thought we could paint them and turn them into chrismas presents for our moms and Grandmas. So, It took me two days to finish this one, But I made this for Josh's mom. We took some of Frankies old desert BDU's and tied knots in the top so we can hang it. Gosh, no-one would ever guess I got a C- in art in middle school!

"event","So far this week has had its ups and downs...

- I have a doctors appt with the army hospital today (not to excited) First off, they will not be touching me, I'm going to tell them I need a referel and if they dont, then I guess I'm flying home! I do NOT trust the army hospital with something this serious. They fuck up everything... I mean, Josh is a line medic for his company, and he knows just as much as the doctors do here on base. Isn't that crazy? If I have another foreign doctor that can't speak english, I will prolly cry when he walks in.

+ I had an hour long massage done this week, It was the best thing in the world! I'm going back in a few weeks for another! When I walked into this place, I was like ""Am I still in Louisiana?"" The lady just looked at me funny. It was something you would see in Hollywood though. 

+ Going on a 2 mile jog with Patti everymorning... I didn't know I was soooo out of shape? But after the first 3 days, it is a lot better now. 

+ Getting a call for an interview

- Not recieving the message until 3 days later, and called back and not heard a word back from the lady yet.

+hanging out with Mandee, She is just as AWESOME as Patti. I am sooo glad I found these two crazy chicks!

-Not having my lawn mowed for the 5th week in a row. We decided we are just giong to let Maggie dig ONE BIG HOLE in the backyard, instead of always covering them up.... It isn't like we really go out there and sit anyway. 

I'm off to Patti's for our Jog!"

"event","This weekend we went camping and it was SOOOO much fun!!! We went with Patti and Frankie and their kids. And my friend Mandee tagged along too. Her husband got deployed last weekend to Iraq again. :( It is so strange saying her husband. We are all soo young to be married. Mandee just turned 20 and her husband is 21 also. She is a really nice girl, but very quiet! I didn't take many pics :( I really should have. But we were too busy fishing and messin around out in the woods. We all decided we were going to go next weekend also. So, I'll take more then. 

But here are a few I took...

This is the river that we were on... It is called Teledo Bend. We were only about 20 min from Texas here.
It was sooo HOTT outside... but the water was FREEZING!!! It was so pretty though.

-Monday, maggie is getting fixed so she can't have babies with the little catdog across the street.
while maggie is getting fixed, I'm getting an hour long massage!! YAHOO! Smitty is sooo good to me!! The place i'm going to is really nice. It is only $50 for an hour... I guess Jade went and she LOVED it! I'm soo excited!! 

So, I think I got a job, but i'm still not getting my hopes up. I will find out next week they said. It starts out at $11 an hour. 

I may be going to Hawaii in November. Josh is going to be in the field, so I'm going to go hangout with his sisters in Hawaii... But we still are not sure about that. I don't want to go without him. I think we are just going to wait until Jan or something. 

We are going to Teledo Bend Saturday to go camping/fishing. I'm super excited!!! We are giong with Patti and Frankie. It will be fun!"

They are just like Smitty and I, but they are a couple too. Not just a group of guys. I'm excited because Patti and I were talking about us all going to Teledo Bend this weekend to go fishing. They catch like sharks and shit! I'm really excited! Oh yeah, and every morning at 9:30 we are going to work out together at the gym. I'm sooo excited! I finally have a workout buddy to get in some shape again. Oh, I think I might have found a job... but i'm not getting my hopes up again. I have soooo much to do tomorrow, i just dont' know where to start. 

Oh yeah, now that we have our bill situation figured out, we have a ton of money all a sudden... It just took a few months thats all. lol we went out shopping yesterday for fun... we ended us getting a bunch of movies and we went to the video game store and got this Mario game for the gamecube. We havn't even had this thing plugged in since we lived here. NOW WE ARE FRICKEN ADDICTED!! We both used to play this game at beegles house a long time ago... and we really liked it... so we bought it. This game is crazy! We play sooo much, and it sucks because it is only one player. 

Alright, I'm giong to get going... gotta go get joshy to bed... He is playing that mario and it is past his bedtime... lol"

Last night was so silly! We went to this Mexican resturant and on the way out there is a sombraro (sp? I was never good at spanish) Well, This thing is HUGE, and Johnson just took it... But no one realized until we got in the car, and he was wearing it! It was pretty crazy! I'm going to have to get a picture of that when I go over there this afternoon. By the way, it is FREEZING down here!!! The Temperature is only 70 today!! I can't believe it!! I'm actually wearing jeans today! It is nice to be cold... but then again if it is cold out, then I want SNOW!!!  I love the warm weather though i'm not looking forward to no snow this year:( Josh found out yesterday that he is getting time off for Christmas... We might come home for a week or so. If we do it would prolly be around New Years time because we have tickets to see the Lions play in San Antonio for Christmas Eve. We really shouldn't come home, just because josh is already sooo many days in the hole... and if we go home, then he will be cutting into his time for when he gets back from afgan for 30 days. :( But we are thinking about it. Oh yeah, HEY S.S..... YOu should call me this weekend... I have some questions! lol And something really silly to tell you!!!

For some reason Jordan took his Crown and decided to leave for Alabama? He said something about going awall... but we think he was kidding. Tonight the guys are drinking and I think i'm going to go to my frined patti's house... We will prolly get a little stoned. I havn't smoked since i was home last. I can't belive it is already October 1st! I think this next weekend we are going to go to Dallas.. or maybe Houston. Well if we go to Dallas then we decided to go to six flags! I really hope we do! I tried to talk sandlin into driving us to Cedar Point. I think I got him thinking about it. It would only be like a 10 hour trip.  oh yeah, p.s. my S.S. Sandlin is going to marry maggie waggie!

It really sucked because they said to expect us to have no power for up to three weeks... and then by the end of this week we wouldn't have water anymore because the towers are dry and we are running on reserve... But Last night, I guess they brought a convoy of trucks 2 miles long to fix our power here at Fort Polk. We had power around 11pm. The MP's came by all the houses yesterday and said just to pack things and go somewhere that has power. That is kinda scary to hear from an MP. I'm glad I stayed here! Well, I'm going to post an ass load of pictures that I took this past weekend from the Hurricane. Sorry if you get pissed that I took so much room... but some of these pics are kinda crazy looking
P.S. If the eye of Rita would have been about 20 miles east, we would prolly not be here at Fort Polk. It would prolly be gone! I guess God just loves us here!
P.S.S. 4 soldiers living in your house + 110 degree temperatures with 84% humidity + no electricity = CRAZYNESS!

The morning after the Hurricane we went out to look at the town of Leesville and Fort Polk (Vernon Perish. As we went down the road from the house we saw this all...

As we got closer to The guys' house in leesville we noticed about EVERY house on the way had a tree on it or the roofs were gone... we were getting kinda scared. But when we got there absolutely nothing was wrong with their shitty house! 
This is their front yard.. with lots of little trees fallen and branches...

The hurricane hasn't even hit yet... but we are already seeing unbelieveable winds!!! crazyness here!!! I have a feeling that we are gong to flood the 15 inches by tonight like they predicted for Fort Polk...

We got another note on our door today... we are supposed to get at least 25 inches of flood. GREAT! Our friends Sandlin, Johnson and Jordan that live off base are prolly going to come stay with us for the weekend. Their house is sooo old that it will prolly fall over the first 10 minutes of the hurricane. We decided to just get a bunch of alcohol and party away. lol They are bording up windows and such, but josh and I decided not to do anything with ours. If they break then they will just have to fix them i guess. We were thinking to tape them up with some army tape... that way if the window breaks then it won't shatter everywhere. We gave maggie a bath today because she needed one... Here is a silly pic of her

"event","Last night my friend Patti called to talk with me. She told me about Hurricane Rita coming our way. I guess it is already a catagory 5! which is the stongest it can get. WTF! I thought Katrina was enough for Louisiana. During Katrina we didn't see any storms because we were on the left side of the hurricane. Well this time, we are on the right side (the worst side)of the hurricane. We got notes on our doors this morning telling us to secure everything on our patios outside, to get plenty of batteries, food, water... cuz we could be out of power for a while. GREAT!!! I'm not to excited about this now. Since we are below sea level and it is all swampy here, we will probably flood. Which i'm also not lookking forward to.  They say to take all our electronics and put them to higher levels. Hopefully this thing is just like a huge storm and doesn't cause too much damage. The lines were sooo long at the gas station today! and it doesn't help it was a fricken 108 degrees with a heat index of 130! gosh! Louisiana is totally differnt from Michigan! I miss the lakes! But then again, I love it here. Josh and I want to stand outside and see how long we can last in the wind and rain! I'm kinda excited to ride this thing out. I guess they will evacuate the city, but they won't evacuate the base only because the soldiers are government property and there is no way in hell they will just be like ""go somewhere and come back when it is all done"" Yeah right! The soldiers were the first ones to the scenes in New Orleans... If it wipes out our base... I guess we are fucked lol. Oh yeah, on a good note... Jade is 3 centimeters dialated!!! yahoo!! they say that she could have her baby tonight or tomorrow! I hope before friday, becuase with the hurricane coming and the barimetric pressure. That makes ladies go in labor... crazyness, huh?!"

-Josh came home as a surprise from work at 10:30am! 
-We slept all day 
-After I woke up, I couldn't find Josh. I looked out the window because I saw stuff flying... He was launching maggies shit over the fence with a shovel.
-at about 5 we went and played tennis
-We spent more time in the woods looking for the balls I hit, rather than playing. 
-we both think I should play golf instead.
-We came back and got Maggie and went for a walk all the way to Dogwood (another neighborhood about 3 miles away)
-When we got home I popped popcorn and we watched the movie 'Now and Then'. (I can't believe I got him to watch it!!) He MUST love me.
-I think Josh and I are going to my sisters house in Missouri for Thanksgiving!! In the last four years, I have only seen her twice! I miss her so much!"

"event","I can't believe I'm writing in this again! twice in one week is out of control! Actually, I'm just waiting for Josh to get back home. Well, he already was home once.. but then got called back to work to sign some papers.? I don't know... Guess what happend today? Well this morning I was kinda just sleeping/watching TV and I heard these really strange noises like someone was breaking in. I started looking all around the house... and I couldn't find Maggie anywhere... Then all a sudden she came out of the bathroom. She jumped on me and she was all wet. I looked in the shower and for some reason she was playing in the bath tub! there were puppie prints everywhere and the inside liner was tore up! She is one crazy dog! I dont' know why she likes the tub. She always puts her head on the side and peeks in when Josh and I are taking showers. She  is so silly! So, I went to see if she had water in her dish, thinking she was thirsty. Well, she had water alright. I guess she just wanted to have a bath... so I gave her one. She doesn't really mind baths for some reason. Lets just say... she is CRAZY!! I'm excited for tonight because Jade is making her 'Southern Chile'. I love the Melvins! every-othernight we cookout at eachothers house. last night we had sghetti here... I made it... and it was SICK!!! I don't know what the hell happend... but the only good part was the garlic bread that came out of the fricken bag! alright well i think josh is home..."

"event","Lets see... The last few days have been consisting of sleeping in late, hanging out with our best friends, and going to the pool to cool off. Josh got soooo sun burned today! He looks like a lobster! We went to the pool with Jade and Melvin. It was sooo much fun! Jade and her pregnant little belly! 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v377/Toots04/FUNSTUFF003.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

We took this picture two nights ago. She is due in Two weeks with a boy, they are naming him Brayden! Yahoo!!! I can't wait! I get to be Aunt Tracy again!! Jade is from Alabama and because of the Hurricane her mommy might not make it in time for her delivery because the Airports are still not open. If she doesn't make it, then Jade said that I get to be in the room when she has Brayden along with Melvin!! I'm sooo excited! I hope her mom can't make it... but then again, i hope she does... she is one crazy woman! She is more like our friend to us rather than ""Jade's Mom"".

It is definatly a different life style living down here. Everyone is just so nice and the weather is beautiful!!! Everyday around 5 or so we get afternoon showers. But these showers are like Michigans ""big storms"" It gets windy and looks like tornado weather... sometimes even the sirens come on ... even though I still have not yet seen a tornado! I think it will take some time. 

I took pictures of our house. It isn't totally finished, we still might get carpet... and we might have to move across base because we heard that Southfort was getting torn down and rebuilt! If so, I won't mind. I mean, I like our house. But I would really like carpet instead of tile floors. That is the only part I don't like about our house. The rest is really nice. Everything is brand-new that came with our house, like our stove and fridge. The tile does make it really nice when Maggie has an accident. She is a puppie and still poops once in a while when we are gone for a long time. 

When the Hurricane hit we thought we would get the storms and such... but actually we didn't even have a single storm! It was sunny as hell here! I don't think that everyone back home really realizes what has happend here in Louisiana. Since I'm down here I actually see it, as well as hear about it everyday. It definatly made me realize that I need to cherish what I have right now... a lot of people don't have anything. This whole thing scared the living shit out of me... Two days ago the whole state of Alabama and Louisiana ran out of gas. It was outragous! Josh and I went to Walmart that night to get some things and everything was gone on all the shelves. Everyone is freaking out down here and it is crazy!! Remember when 9/11 hit and everyone was freaking out? well this is ten-million times more! We tried to get some toliet paper and there was three full boxes left.... the whole two isles at walmart were gone... it was just empty boxes! josh and i just stood there in awe along with some other people. The isle where the can goods are was completly empty. anything that was not frozen or refridgerated was just gone. It took us a total of an hour just to get through the checkout line. The whole state of LA is going insane! We talked to some people today that are from New Orleans. Their house was burried under the water...and they have nothing but what is in their pockets and on their back. It is so sad! Today we were walking through the parking lot at walmart and everyother car was just piled of things such as pillows, blankets, pictures, clothing... we could tell that they were all people that escaped from ""hell"". 

Life down here has definatly changed with everyone. There are so many people that are letting families come live with them on base. One of josh's infantry men has 14 people living at his two bedroom home right now. They will be there for months before anything else can be done. the 2/4 10th mountain is supposed to be brought over there. I hope they do, Since Josh is a medic he will be helping people and cleaning up the city. He will prolly be gone for a while... but I dont' care... I know that is his job and someone has to do it... Bush isn't doing anything about this. Military are the only smart ones around here. 

Wow... I can't believe I had so much to write... well i'll post some pictures and then Josh and I are going to go watch a movie together. 

This is our kitchen... i couldn't turn the pic for some reason... it pisses me off!!!

The two weeks when Josh was home was the best in the entire world! Between Tom Petty, The party at the Fyan's, Fourth of July, my bachelorette party and my wedding... There is nothing else I could have ever asked for! All of my friends are WONDERFUL! I just love them all. Our wedding was the most beautiful thing, along with the reception...
-Alex and Laura filled in at the last minute! I LOVE THEM GIRLS!!!!!
-our families were sooo supportive during everything
-the wedding was gorgeous!
-the church was packed all the way till the last 5 or 6 rows! There were about 250 people just at the wedding! very good turnout...
-when i was standing with Josh at the altar he whisperd (You look beautiful and I love you so much) that meant more to me than anything in the entire world! I don't think we were supposed to hold hands through the whole thing... but we couldn't help it! 
-after the wedding we went to the beach in all the awesome cars!
-everyone was drunk by the time we got there! :) 
-we got our whole wedding party's picture in front of the 'Welcome To Twin Lake' sign. 
-as soon as we got to the reception we got drinks
-we had BBQued chicken and it was sooo messy!!!! (thank god for the wet naps)
-There were so many people at the reception that we had to set up more tables and chairs
-I actually drank (usually I don't) my family was there if something crazy would have happend like seizures. :) 
-The dance my daddy and I danced to, I sure do love him even though he is a drunk lol.
-josh got me really really good with the cake! my face was covered!! good thing I don't wear makeup! :)
-Rexy stripped down to his undies!! (that was one of the best times!!!)
-Rexy going up to the bar to get more beer: The Bartenders say, ""Rexy we told you we won't give you anymore until you bring back the last pitcher"" Rexy says, ""That's what I'm trying to tell you, I don't know where it is!!!"" 
-When the American Soldier song came on, I think almost everyone on the dance floor started crying. It wasn't all sad cries, it was pure happy cries too! 
-All my family absolutly loves Josh and still talkes about him even though he has been gone a week. 
-At about 2 in the morning my big brother brought Rexy home and at about 3am he showed back up at the reception asking for a pop... I guess he walked back? lol
-Drew went downstairs at like 3am and was eating chicken like a piggy, all my aunts felt bad for him becase they thought he didn't eat in a while, so they kept bringing him out food lol
-singing and dancing with all my friends and family was great!
-We hugged everyone once sometimes even twice before we left at the end of the night. 
-I had to give all my Twin Lake Brothers a kiss on the cheek before we left. They are all so wonderful! I love them all! 
-Now that I married one, I think I married them ALL!!! (which isn't that bad actually) :)
-I leave on Wednesday and I am sooo excited! 
-Brock, Lil D and Christina are coming with!!! YAHOO!!!!! (I love that girl!) 

All in all, It was THE BEST DAY OF MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! I am in love with the best man in the entire world!!! 

But I just want to say thank you to all my friends for helping set up at the hall, and for being there for me! Especially I want to say thanks to Alyssa, Alex and Laura! You girls rock!!! Alyssa you were there the whole time from beginning til end! Alex and Laura you two just make me smile so much! I'm sooo happy you were a part of it all! The famous words of advice ""we'll figure it out, don't worry"" I sure as hell had a ton to think about, and it didn't help when people made it more complicated. by the way, I think my mom went psycho that night! 

There were only a few people and families that didn't show up, and I was kinda sad... the person I wanted most there didn't come and that was my Aunt Sandi. I miss her sooo much and I understand that they live a million miles away. I just wish she could have made it to my wedding. So, Aunt Sandi if you are reading my livejournal like you sometimes do, I LOVE YOU!!!!!! When I get down to Louisiana, I will be writing you!!!"

"event","Well, I have exactly two days until Smitty finally comes home! I can't wait!!!! These last few weeks have been sooo nice not working. Last Sunday was my last day at the nursery working... They thanked me in front of the church, (which was unexpected). Kinda a strange feeling being the only one standing in front of the church while the pastor tells the congregation what my plans are and why i'm leaving. lol I wasn't nervous! :) They gave me a card with 50 bucks in it. I was surprised!! I went fishing three out of the five days last week! It was so much fun! Sean and I took his boat out without his dad knowing lol. Oh well, he didn't care I guess. We caught prolly close to 30 fish. It was fun! Oh yeah, I almost died a few weeks ago on Brocks Harley..... That is a long story, but lets just say, I sure hope my heart never stops like that again! I went to the Beach with Smitty's mommy and grandma yesterday. That was fun. I brought my new puppie out there. Maggie is soooo fricken cute! I love her! I can't wait to bring her to Louisianna, and I also can't wait for Josh to see her! She is 7 weeks old today! 

The wedding is going good. We ran out of invitations... We got an extra 25 and we still ran out! WTF!!!!!!! Oh well. We have to draw a line somewhere right? Mine and Josh's parents are telling me that everyone that Josh and I invited that are just friends... (not friends and their families) but just friends, has to bring their invitations with their names on the front saying that they were invited. Only because we can't have people showing up if they didn't recieve an invite. It sucks it has to be this way, but seriously the hall only holds 275 people, and we sent out a good 200 invites (figure at least 3 people in each family)... and well that means that we are giong to be packed. So, PLEASE, anyone that didn't recieve an invite don't plan on coming... I am not saying this to be a bitch or anything, but when you plan your wedding you will see why. You can't invite the whole world. I know a lot of people will prolly be like ""what a bitch, I didn't get invited, I thought we were friends."" But everyone has to realize that we had to draw a line somewhere, and family comes first! we really only had about 15 invitations to send out to friends anyway. I guess the reason why i'm giong on about this so much is just becuase i'm getting sick of people asking why they didn't get an invite. Who gives a fuck, it is a wedding and thats it. I know a lot of people would only want to be invited because they think that it is going to be this big party where they can get drunk and trashed. but i'm sorry...that will not be happening, only if you are of age will anyone be drinking. So I guess I have said everything that has been on my mind lately... and i'm sorry if i hurt anyones feelings, or if anyone thinks i'm a bitch, because at this point... I could really careless. When it is your time... you will see

Alright, well now that I finally got that off my chest... I think I""m giong to go to the beach!!!!!!"

"event","Lets See, I havn't updated in a while only because I have been working soo many fucking hours! Last week I babysat every day. It was hell, the kids were soooo fricken bad! Kelli and I will never again answer our phones if they call us. lol and on top of that, we got paid really really shitty. Oh well, Last week I worked so much that I made $376.71 and that isn't counting the money from the nursery on sundays. I was really happy that I worked, but then again it doesn't seem like I am really having a summer at all. I can't go to the beach and hangout only because I have to work everyday at 2:30 to 7. Oh well, This is my last week working!!!! YAHOO!!!! It is time to have some fun  next week... well and get all my other shit done for the wedding. I still have invitations to do, but I think I will do some of them tonight when i get home from work. The Holiday weekend was really nice. I finally got to relax. I packed all of my stuff and went to hangout with Smittys mom up north. I just came back yesterday. It was so nice being able to hangout with her and not have anyone calling my phone asking me what i'm doing and if i want to hangout with them, or my mom asking me if i did this, or that. It was just so relaxing. I needed it. We played games, went on the golf cart through the woods, went on walks, laid in the sun. It was just so nice. Josh went to Cincinnatti (sp?) this last weekend. He was sooo happy to be out of work for five days. He called me drunk almost everynight. I love it, he is so cute when he gets drunk. He is always so nice. I just can't wait for him to come home. I miss him so much. It is hard being away from the one you love for such a long time, especially when we are getting married. I wish he was here to make decisions for himself. It sucks because I know that he will be happy with anything, but still. it is his wedding too, and he can't even make any decisions with me. oh well. I'm just excited that this is my last week working until I go to Louisiana and find a job down there. Which is awesome cuz it will prolly be in a hospital or a dental office. I can't wait to just be with my baby, I am giong to miss my friends... but I miss him more than anything in the entire world. The wedding is now in 38 days, and It is giong to be sooo much fun, but also, it will be one of the sadest days just becase I don't know when I will ever be home again. I'm still trying to get people's addresses for invitations... it sucks because i work so much i don't ever have time to call anyone or even look up addresses. CRAZYNESS!! lol i just need to hire someone. jk. alright, well i have to go to work... well the bank first... but then work... MAKE SOME MONEY! Oh yeah, I can't wait till tomorrow!!! Michelle and I are going to give all the puppies baths again!!! YAHOO!!! I can't wait! They are soooo big, last night I put on on the ground and was having it chase me, she was biting my toes. It was so cute! alright I really ahve to go now... I prolly won't be on for about a week or so lol........."

-I worked Tuesday and Wednesday, but had Thursday off!!!! YAHOO!!!
-I went shopping Thursday and Friday for wedding things...
-I got a puppie!!!!!!! And I'm super super excited!!! I think her name will be Spartie...
-Went to a few hockey games this week, That was awesome!!!! I love doing stuff like that! 
- Hung out with Sean a lot this week also. He is such a nice guy! Who would have ever thought that all through high school we really never hungout... and now he is like one of my best freinds lol. 
-I had Chinese three times this week! Once with Val, Sean and Brock. 
-I'm super excited about the wedding... and i'm finally gathering more and more addresses (that is the worst part) ... man this is a lot of work! I still need some more though... It is just seeing people, and trying to get them is the hard part. 
-my mom asked me lastnight what I did... I really don't remember... maybe I was stoned? Oh yeah, I think that was ALL week... 

I'm out... giong to go clean my car! 
p.s. I could sleep for many many days!!!!!!!!"

"event","Today was Mother's Day, and it really didn't seem like it. I guess if my mom didn't just get surgery on Friday then maybe it would have been a little better. Also, If both my grandmothers were alive, then it might have been a little better also. :( So, I woke up early this morning and went to church. I got home before my mommy and put a little bag with some special lotion that she loves in it, and I set her card on the table. Kelli D. Called when i was in the shower... and I think she was surprised that I answered ""I'm in the shower right now, but yeah, I can talk"" she let me go anyway. lol. Since my mom wasn't feeling good all day, i decided to leave and let her sleep. I went to Kelli's and celebrated Mothers Day over at her house (my other family). I got to ride on Brads motorcycle... and now i'm addicted! I want one soooooooo bad!!! I really hope Smitty lets me! Brock said he will take me for a ride on his too... that would be awesome! Someday I would love to drive them things all the way across the U.S.!!! that would be the best vacation in the entire world!! So, At kelli's I met her new boyfriend Tommy... which was really really funny.... boy do i love kelli's dad! lol He just cracks me up!! A little to the left, and a little to the right... lol what a suckup? boy o boy.... today was a funny day. Kelli D, I love you sooo fricken much!!!! I can't wait for you to come to LA with me on the ride down there! You always make my day when you call me to hangout. I just miss you soooo much!! 

After Kelli's I went home and talked with my mommy, who still wasn't feeling better. So, I fell asleep until I got a few phone calls to wake me up. It was Josh's mom, and Brock. I bought Val a mothers day card and a really nice flower plant for mothers day. But, I was supposed to go over there, and they didn't come home from up north in time. I will just see her tomorrow and it will be just a little late.  So, I ended up going to Rex's hockey game tonight at 9... that was really cool... and I mean cool! I was freezing!!!!!!!! I had my flip flops on, because i forgot that it was cold in ice rinks.. Oh, they lost. And it was their first time losing i guess. Oh well, It was bound to happen. It was strange because tonight Sean called me and was wondering what I was up to, and I told him I was going to the hockey game.... But then he was like ""oh, well I guess there is no reason to call you because I'm playing in the hockey game, So i guess I will see you there."" lol... crazyness!!!! So, After the game Brock and I went to Dustins and then to Lil D's. And we fed the fish in his pond.. There were like a ton of trout jumping!! It was sooo nice out tonight! I love the weather!!!! Summer here we come!!! Then we went to meijer to only find that the fish tanks were closed again... and they only had like 7 1/2 gold fish!!!! WTF!!!! There were like half dead ones in there.... I think we are going to go to petsmart sometime this week instead. Well, I'm tired... and I have a doctors appt tomorrow bright and early. Then I'm hanging out with sean, and meeting my mommy and Val at the church to findout what we have to do still. lol This wedding stuff is crazy!! I'm glad i'm not picking much out... well I am, but I really could care less about colors and clothes and decorations... I just want to get married, Have a HUGE party with all our friends to share the most wonderful day with us... and, love my baby forever! I can't wait just to be with him... and someday live here in TL and have a family. I love it here!!! Brock and I were talking today about how we take the lake for granted sooo much because we live so close. Like a few minutes and we are there! I love it! But, when I was in Big Rapids for the first two months I was always like ""LETS GO TO THE BEACH!!!"" and then i realized, we didn't have a beach in BR!!! FUCK! (did you like that one amanda? hopfully you didn't read it, so then you won't say it)Holy crap!! this is a super long entry for some odd reason. I guess i'm just bored, or tired... Oh wait, I know... I'M FUCKING STONED! SUMMER ROCKS MY WORLD! I wanna go golfing!!!! NOW!!!!! 

Dan, Amanda and Alyssa.... I miss you all!!! Please come to see Ira Ira soon!"

"event","So, My first official night home. It feels good to be home, but I do miss my friends already! Lastnight was fun, and I'm glad I ended up going back to school. I wish Amanda would have been able to hangout for longer... but she is sick... and I understand. 

Let me tell you who it the craziest of all!!! Mr. Dan.... geeze that kid cracks me up. Last night we watched the movie Elf. I love that movie sooo much!!!! Even though I just met Dan this semester, it seems like I have known this kid forever. It is really strange. He is the nicest guy in the entire world... I wish I could find a super nice girl for him. He would make her the happiest person on the entire planet. He is always positive about things. He likes to have fun... and most of all, he is funny and good looking. He is just an all around perfect guy! I'm sure going to miss him a lot!!! I'm also going to miss spanish. I loved that class sooo much. I'm glad that Dan and I got to go to Steves one last time. He is sooo silly! I can't believe he just took his pants off in front of us last week! lol His cookout was sooo much fun!! I loved it! 

Yeah, Frances had puppies... and I'm sooo excited! I can't wait until they get a little bigger!!! I hope to go to Brocks soon... I'm going to steal one... shhhhh don't tell. 

My baby called me yesterday and said he can't call me for 6 days... And then said ""i love you"" and hung up. Well, he lied lol. He called me twice to far today!!! And both times were from a porter potty just to tell me for 30 seconds that he misses me and loves me... He is sooo fricken cute! I love him sooo much! I just hope he doesn't get caught with his phone by 1st sergent. That would suck. Ohyeah, he also said that they are sleeping on the ground and he woke up this morning with frost all over him. :( I just want him to come home. I miss my buddy so much! 

Alright, well, i'm tired... off to bed"

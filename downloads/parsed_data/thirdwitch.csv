"event","that really weird subject is part of a sweeney todd song so no i havent gone insane yet tho its debatable. ai. last night was so much fun. the usual eight of us, being me, laura, nat, isa, kyle, neil, rmax, and trey, got together last night. we saw War of the Worlds which scared the hell out of me. jesus. that movie is really really scary. i watched the entire thing between my fingers. yikes. then we went ice skating which was really really fun. poor neil. he cant ice skate at all. he kept falling down and i dont think he's ever going to ice skate again. and trey kept trying to push people over. but it was quite fun because i actually remembered how to ice skate which surprised me. then we ate dinner at tokyo wako which was fun too. lots of intrigue involving cherries and such. we all treated trey to dinner since he bailed us out last time. so that was fun. and then we walked down the street to starbucks and rmax started showing us magic tricks and all this people came over and started watching and it was really fun and cool. so yeah..going to rehearsal..staying at lauras house this weekend...yay!"

"event","goddamn it all. i had such a long entry and i x-ed out of the wrong thing. damn. i spent twenty minutes on that. damn damn damn. 
argh. anyways. i will try to recreate it. aaaah. frustration. 
well this week was utterly crazy. so much has happened i dont know if i can remember it all. i havent had any time to write it down either. i think i left off when i was going to nats house. hmmm. 
well i went home with nat and kyle after rehearsal on thursday. we hung out on the lawn for a while and everybody came over, everybody being isa, laura, and rmax. we lay on the lawn for a while and then we started playing cranium. it was so much fun. its kinda a silly game but we all got really into it. me, laura, rmax versus isa, nat and kyle. involved much yelling, shouts of joy, competition, and banging on the timer to make it go faster. it was hysterically funny. then we went inside and ate hamburgers and such. after that we went down to the basement and started playing twister. well at first it was normal twister and then it evolved to a sort of uber-twister not for the faint-hearted. kyle and isa started walking around telling each person where to put each specific appendage and i swear you have never seen a group of people so tangled up in you life. i mean TANGLED. it was intense. and exhausting. then we got down the ping pong table, and nat found a Would You Rather..book that was very...interesting to say the least. so we spent the next however long with me and rmax having a hardcore ping pong match and nat asking really kinky would you rather questions causing much hilarity. it was great.
friday morning got up at seven AM. long travel day. all i need say is that our flight was delayed for three hours and we got to the hotel in holland at eleven PM. ugh. mary got there around midnight. so that was a late night and an early start the next morning. sleepy. anyways spent the first part of the day getting ready for the wedding which was at two. it was a very sweet wedding, if a bit unconventional. my oldest cousin Marcy married a man named Mike Marcelletti. so ironically her married name is Marcelle Marcelletti. wow. and i guess the two of them are Mr. and Mrs. Mike and Marcelle Marcelletti. M's to the max. we blew bubbles at them instead of throwing rice. the reception quite honestly dragged a bit, but it was fun in the sense that i got to see all of my relatives again and a few that i hadnt seen in quite a while. no one recognized me because of my haircut and my dress(that i am in love with :) so that was fun seeing everyone. and i have the most adorable nephew in the world. he has white-blond hair and blue eyes and an enormous toothless smile and hes walking all over the place. he cant say anything yet except 'uh-oh!"" but he uses that quite a bit, mainly when he flings something on purpose. he is so cute!!!! :)anyways so that was fun. we went back to the hotel quite late cause we were watching a bunch of awesome fireworks.  my aunt char, who is a total riot, won over 230 bucks on a hotel gambling game that she was playing with two of her boys, aged 11 and 13. i got a lot of money cause they divided it simply by being in the same room. she was running around yelling ""we're rich!! we're rich!!"" omg. it was great. and i beat my dad at ping pong for the first time in years. 
sunday was awesome. sunday alone made the entire trip worth it. it was so fun. the weather was absolutely perfect both days. anyways in the morning we went to my uncle jet's house for brunch. my cousin jean-paul, has found a new career. having recently retired from the army, he is now a mary kay(cosmetics) salesman. that alone made my weekend. i have to say that was something that never even occured to me. i have seen it all. afterwards we drove to fremont, to my ...father's cousin's house. i have an extremely large extended family that is totally awesome and very close. everyone is related to everyone else by way of cousins more or less. so lots of people were there. giant family reunion only it was really really fun. cause everybody lives really far away from each other. they have this awesome house on a lake with a dock and boats and a raft and stuff. it was so neat. and all sorts of games and stuff. trying to remember what we did. swam across the lake. the water was really warm and awesome. and everybody was pushing everybody in. i totally fell for a bunch of really obvious tricks played by my artful younger cousins and that was rather embarassing :). tricks as in how can we push her in. another one of my father's many cousins has an organic vineyard up in mendecino county. actually they were the first organic vineyard in california. anyways she brought three of her kids with her. i hadnt seen them since i was little and it was so nice to see them again. caroline is 27. she's absolutely gorgeous and so nice and happy. what is really frightening is that a few years ago, she married a man and they moved to hawaii to manage a ginger farm, only it turned out to be abusive and she had to escape. its an incredible story really. really scary. she had to literally say she was taking the dog for a walk and get a suitcase she had hidden at the end of the driveway and escape to the airport. i had heard about it but i didnt know it was her. and she is such an incredible person. shes totally awesome. i think hes in jail now. anyways it was so nice to see her so happy. her sister eliza is 24 and totally awesome and nice too. and the youngest one, tommy, is 16. he was so nice, and i hung out with him a lot of the day. he's pretty cute too. lol anyways lots of impromptu games of HORSE. i actually ended up winning one against all the basketball players in the family. that was a lot of fun. so played basketball a lot of the day. and they had badminton too. tommy and i actually beat everyone and that was hilarious and fun. lots of diving. haha. a lot of the older people started playing speed scrabble, which is way more fun than normal scrabble and i played that for a while too. the weather was awesome. lots of food too. :) so that was so fun. apparently the last time i saw caroline and eliza and everyone i was about five with pigtails. also apparently my great aunt gave me and tommy a tea party, which neither of us remember and which was really surprising cause now he's at least 6'2"" and so forth. well it was basically like meeting him for the first time since we were so little before but it was so fun. he plays the piano too. my aunts forced me to play and then he played some stuff he wrote that was really pretty. it was really fun. omg. it was such a perfect day. i cant wait to get my pictures back. god it was so fun. we got back really late last night too. 
woke up this morning to the sound of william going DA DA DA DA DA!!! and trotting around. he actually managed to TP the room. we got home at about five o clock so the trip back was quite nice. saw the grand canyon from the plane, and it was amazing. 
well...not much more to say on this massive entry. except this was such a nice weekend. yay!"

"event","wow. i have had no time at all this week. craziness. hmmmm
saturday i went to fencing, and despite the fact that i hadnt fenced in about a month i managed to take second out of seven ppl. i would have won if corin hadnt been there, but i scored more touches on him than anyone else, so hehe. :)
sat. nite. nat, isa, kyle, and rmax came over. we ended up watching young frankenstein which is a hilarious movie, and the inevitable pillow fight. so that was fun...
sunday i dont really think i did anything INTERESTING except i went shopping with mom which was fun. 
monday..first fst rehearsal...managed to basically catch up even tho im starting a week late. its so intense and really fun. we sound really good. i mean those guys can SING. :) its really tiring too. lots of standing around on stage. but it looks good too. 
monday night me, isa, nat, kyle, laura, trey, rmax and neil all went bowling. it was crazy. and all the people who said they sucked ended up winning and so forth. and we had dinner at islands. dont go there cause they rip you off. and then we walked around for a while. haha nat. wow it was great. 
umm tuesday. more rehearsal. and a piano recital. that i didnt screw up at. which is always nice. chris goodpasture was insanely good as always. i ended up getting his sn and we talked on AIM for about an hour and a half. hes REALLY nice. 
yesterday...more rehearsal and afterwards we went to see WICKED!!! omg it was AWESOME. indescribable. fantastic. amazing. incredible. marvelous. she has the most beautiful voice. the whole production was...amazing. it was probably the highlight of my summer. and we ate dinner at this really cool tapas restaurant. 
packing to go to marcy's wedding tomorrow...and going to rehearsal soon and then going to nats house which will be tres fun. yay!

when you love someone but it goes to waste 
what could be worse?

"event","wow so that was undoubtedly one of the coolest trips i have ever been on but i am sooo happy to be home. the flight to tortola was a nightmare. took a red-eye, left at 11:00 pm, got to miami at 6:00 am the next day, two hour flight to san juan, three hour delay because of a frickin volcano, flight to tortola, got to the hotel at 6:00 PM. ugh. spent the night at that hotel and then we got on the boat the next day. gorgeous boat. so we sailed to all these islands and it was beautiful and the water was gorgeous and the food was incredible. i didnt sunburn and i'm really tan now haha. anyways so it was amazing and i cant wait to get my gazillion pictures back. got home last night and i'm really excited to see everyone tonight so that will be awesome. kinda pathetic that this is all i write but there is no way to put a trip like that into words and besides i have to go get ready for fencing now. yep."

"event","well on sunday i cant remember anything except we went to sushi roku for dinner and then came home and watched what about bob. monday was really awesomely fun. i went to kyle's house with nat and isa and laura. and we had the best time. we bounced around on her trampoline and went to the general store and bought balloons and lollipops so we looked like we were five and waved to all the cars which was hilarious. and we had this really sweet little balloon ceremony thing that i dont want to tell about but it was really sweet and then we went around in a circle and said something nice about everybody. we had hamburgers and stuff and then we played with the ouija board and the five of us called rmax on speakerphone and it was hilariously fun cause we were so hyper. 
today i ran into mr. karbelnig, mrs aiken, and mr chandrasoma's older brother which was crazy. got a big maroon 5 poster and a few CDs so thats cool. we're leaving in like five minutes on our awesome sailing trip to the BVIs. omg i cant believe its here. aaah gtg."

well my ipod stopped working. it will not turn on so thats really frustrating. 
anyways the galaxy game was AWESOME!!! it was the coolest thing ever. infinitely more fun than dodger games. helluva lot more action, incredible athletes, smaller stadium, everyone was so into it, it was so awesome. kyle and i got t-shirts and we ate tacos and a bunch of candy and it was so fun. on the way back we wanted to have a guy talk but her parents and her little brother were in the car so we had a written conversation back and forth the entire way home and it was really funny.
got twelve hours of sleep finally for the first time in months. yeah...
going to dinner tonight, and thats...about it....yep. 
omg i totally forgot. dad sailed over to catalina with a few other people and our friends boat caught on fire and basically blew up but no one was hurt. but still. jesus."

"event","omg last night was SOOOOO fun. it was awesome. i mean it was awesome. laura came over around six and we started playing horse, with basketballs and such you know, and we were so bad so we played pig insead, but we were just really bad. then rmax came and he's as bad as we are, so that was fun too. then kyle came and then nat, then neil and isa and finally trey. so we were playing horse and that disintegrated into shooting the ball randomly and trying not to hit the porsche, and then the ball accidentally hit rosie so we called rmax the dog-murderer all night and then we lowered the hoop to about seven feet cause we were teasing nat and rmax about being so short and then neil tried to do this 360-dunking the ball thing that failed utterly and he crashed into the pole and the ball hit the rim and made this huge noise that we thought was his head so we all thought he killed himself but it was hilarious at the same time. 
then eventually the pizza came. the pizza guy was really weird cause i gave him forty bucks and it was twenty-two and he said how much should i give, i.e. how much is my tip? and i totally forgot about the tip and i was like, well eighteen. and he said, ""pardon me, miss, no disrespect, but how much do you want to give me for a tip? and i was thinking o #### i'm really dumb and then trey came and rescued me and told the guy four dollars and he left thank god. and trey was like "" i thought you'd been over here too long"" and i was just like THANK YOU SO MUCH. so we ate pizza outside on the grass. it was really funny, we were going inside to get soda and stuff and rmax used to take french so he was like its le boisson, right (which means drink) and i said oui. EVERYONE knows what ""oui"" means but he didnt get it so he said it again and i was like OUI and it went back and forth for like two minutes till i was finally like you IDIOT i said OUI. and it was really funny. so we ate outside and i was trying to tie nat's shoelaces together and i wasn't paying attention so rmax tried to tie mine together at the same time only he pulled on a loose thread by accident and totally unraveled my entire shoelace. and trey was making modern art with his coke can. eventually we all trooped inside and decided to watch oceans 11. which is an awesome movie. so we swung all the chairs around and moved the tables and watched the movie and afterwards we got into a massive pillowfight. MASSIVE. using the sofa pillows which are really thump-y so it was awesome. it was basically all the girls versus rmax except for laura. so we were trying to beat up rmax with pillows and he kept shoving us into the chairs and stuff and then trey came in while rmax was lying on the sofa and just started hitting him with this pillow like WHAM WHAM WHAM and it was great. omg it was awesome. and we just hung out for a while and it was really really really so much fun. 
then laura, nat, isa, and kyle spent the night and we got to bed at three-thirty cause we were talking. and we talked even more this morning. i went to fencing and i was half-dead at first but i won my pool which was eight people so that was really cool. going to a galaxy game tonight with kyle so that will be fun...
have to go clean my room...."

well i got at least a B on my chem final. which is pretty good since it was as hard as hell. 15 pages of multiple choice yucky. 
the pool party was really fun. we went swimming. kyle and laura and i kept trying to sit on this raft at the same time and it kept sinking and kyong kept flipping it over. but it was really fun. the guys threw ian sander in the pool with all his clothes on only it ruined his cellphone and his calculator which REALLY sucks. so then they threw alex feliciano in and that was hilarious. and we hung out and played ping pong and it was really fun. 
so nat,isa, kyle, laura, neil, rmax, and trey are coming over later and we're gonna watch movies and stuff. which will be fun. yep.

i stayed after school to ask dr. k. some questions since mr beattie is a bastard. and then i hung with nat and laura and rmax and went with them to their physics review since i had nothing better to do. only i forgot mom had an appt at 11:00. she said she told me but i have no recollection of it whatsoever. anyways so she was really pissed at me. and now i have to study for chem. i have never been this scared for a test in my entire life and mom just doesnt get it. she thinks that if she tells me getting a B is not an option that will help me somehow but i'm just plain terrified. 
so i guess i better start studying."

"event","i didn't realize until now how much i would miss the glass menagerie. god it was so fun. i mean, i didnt know sophie well at all, i just knew she was in laramie project and pippin and i had talked to her once or twice, danny i knew kinda as macbeth but i was brand-new and still didnt know many kids in my own grade yet, and he was in pippin and laramie but it wasnt like i had talked to him, jasmine i was definitely friends with cause of macbeth, but all of them, i mean i got to know them so well, mr. eaton too. i was i guess friends with him because he was in macbeth and all the set-building stuff for pippin, but really he's such a cool guy. 
sophie's so awesome. she's one of the coolest seniors i know. she's so pretty and outgoing and friendly and funny. she was never mean to me because i was a freshman or anything. she's just so..awesome. danny was never really that talkative to me at least, but ""we did have a speaking aquaintance"" ""yes, we spoke to each other."" so i can say hey to him and stuff in the hallways. and jasmine is definitely my best friend among the juniors. she's hilarious i love her. and she's such a good actress. mr eaton is really cool too. well he definitely didnt act like we were all students and he was the teacher. partly cause he's only four years older than sophie. well and he's just out of college so he probably doesnt feel all that grown-up. but he's awesome too. and he's an incredible actor. i mean he's the drama teacher but all of his students were really surprised cause they'd never seen him act. i dunno. it was just so fun. i mean the five of us would never finish rehearsing cause we'd get sidetracked and talk for half an hour. 
i didnt expect the show to go as well as it did. well i guess you never do because the days right before are always madness and chaos. i mean we didnt even get the lights working until an hour before the show. but it did go really well. we didnt fuck up. we screwed up a bit but thats different. we did a really good job too. well the audience was awesome on thursday. they laughed at all the right bits. i didn't expect to get half as many compliments as i did. that sounds really fatheaded and conceited but thats not what i'm trying to say. i thought i was fine, but i didnt think i was wonderful or anything, and people said they felt so sad and moved and stuff. charlie kennedy said he had tears in his eyes. which really surprised me. so i guess its good when it goes that well. well of course its good, it was just unexpected. 
god i miss everybody. i'm never going to see sophie again. thats so depressing. 
i love that bit at the end when i'm crying and mr eaton is giving his monologue and he jumps down into the house and screams ""anything that can BLOW YOUR CANDLES OUT!!! blow your candles out laura."" and i blow two out and then he says ""and so-""  i blow out the last one, its pitchblack for a second and he says ""goodbye"", lights a match, and blows it out. 
i thought it must have looked really cool since obviously i didnt really get to watch it. 
ok ill shut up now"

does it make sense to be nostaligic for something you've never really had? i mean, you have, but it ended badly, and now you're nostalgic for something you dont have thats different from what ended badly. its entirely different but not quite. ok that was really cryptic sorry. i just finished reading the amber spyglass by philip pullman. KABA skip a few sentences cause i dont want to give anything away. i got to the part where lyra realizes she's in love with will. and they're walking and she tells him something and he turns around and gives her this beaming smile and oh i have to quote it ""He turned and gave her a true smile, so warm and happy she felt something stumble and falter inside her; at least, it felt like that, but without Pantalaimon she couldn't ask herself what it meant. It might have been a new way for her heart to beat. Deeply surprised, she told herself to walk straight and stop feeling giddy."" god how true. especially the giddyness. and the stumbling bit. i guess its more nostalgia for something you could have but dont. i have to stop this. but i dont want to. oh i cant find the other bit but she thinks something about it being subdued and pressing and half-painful and half-happy. ok i really have to stop this and study for math. 
but i dont want to.
i think i did really well on my english final. the vocab was easy and i think i did really well on the essay though i might not have.
studying for math. 
i had my voice evaluation for lacc. and they told me i need to be more confident and learn a few tricks because they said i have a beautiful voice i just need to let it do its thing i guess and stop being so nervous. so they told me i should take voice lessons over the summer which would be kinda fun.
i feel sad right now. i dont know why. well i do but i dont want that to be why i'm sad because i shouldnt be sad about that. its silly."

well last night went pretty well. the audience was smaller, and a lot of the people had seen it on thursday so they werent as responsive. laughing wise. but it still went quite well. well the part where i fall down the stairs. last night i really did fall and it hurt like hell. omg. i totally wiped out. which is perfect in a sense because it looked totally real and sounded really loud. cause it was real. afterwards everyone said it scared them to death cause they didnt know if i was supposed to fall or not. well i have a massive bruise on my butt to prove i really did fall. 
my crying at the end was a lot better too. so last night kari, kyle, claire, tiffany, neil, and rmax came. and they all liked it. they stole me roses from some of the school rosebushes. so that was cute. kyle and rmax stayed and helped with strike, which only took an hour or so. thank god they stayed cause if they hadnt it would have taken a lot longer. we had to carry a ton of stuff over to the basement. and kyle and rmax bicker all the time. i think its hilarious cause they get so pissed off at each other. we painted the walls black again too. afterwards we all went to rocky cola and that was really fun.

so. the show. :) :) :) house opened and jasmine and i were behind the little screen thing. she was really excited and i was really nervous and we were both bouncing all over the place trying to muffle our hysterical laughing in the clothes. i love jasmine. 
WE WERE AWESOME. it was so cool. everyone thought jasmine was hilarious. same with mr. eaton. they both did a fantastic job. and danny was very good too. omg his fly was open. as soon as we got backstage after we bowed, mr eaton went, ""so danny, did you plan on doing the entire show with your fly unzipped?"" danny looks down and goes ""FUCK!!!!"" and it was hilarious and we fell all over the walls laughing. 
i have the coolest friends in the world. nat and laura and isa and kaba came and they were so excited and happy. and it made me feel so happy. and charlie kennedy came and he was like ""i had tears in my eyes"" i love that kid to death. and MR BACHMANN came over to me and was like ""that was really moving"" and i said thank you whilst internally spazzing out cause he's the headmaster and all. omg it was AWESOME.
today was the awards ceremony. so we all dressed up. rmax wore a velvet coat which was really funny. so short classes. we were all depressed cause it was the last day.

lunch i cant remember. 
english. took an intensely hard grammar final. 
french. we did our skit that everyone actually liked. magnus was being a total jerk to anna and his skit was so painfully slow cause he was being so painstakingly sarcastic everyone was just thinking what the hell? but whatever. 
chemistry we learned about DNA and RNA and lipids. w00t.
jasmine and i ran to alcorn after school.
wow. rehearsal was crazy. it took us FOREVER to start. dr parker was doing lights and being SOOOOOO goddamn pissy and rude about everything and jesse was just making SOOO MANY sarcastic, rude remarks cause thats just what he does and it was SOOO annoying. its like we didnt work our butts off on this show to have all the tech people come in and frickin insult us. anyways so mrs vaughn came and watched and she said it was terrific and she loved it. so there were a few ""oh fuck"" moments but they were pretty hilarious. it was pretty fun actually. notes were hilarious afterwards but its kinda embarassing. anyways so we finally got outta there and mr eaton gave me and jasmine a ride home. oh he got a haircut and its hilarious cause he looks even younger. yeah.

today. 
chem. we learned about glucose and fructose and sucrose and all that good sugary stuff.
english took a poem test. i memorized all of dover beach being crazy, and i only missed one comma. DOMINATION haha. 
computer we watched this brain-melting anime called Le Portrait de Petite Cossette about this guy that falls in love with the ghost of a girl that was murdered 250 years ago thats trapped in a venetian glass goblet. it was crazy-ass trippy. it was WEIRD. 
PE we hung out and nat and i did cartwheels. hehe. laura- we give NO damns. haha. 
lunch was fun. we studied frantically for french and tried to convince rmax that his coffee popsicle looked like a frozen cow tongue. 
history. worksheets. yaaaaay.
algebra. listened to music and reviewed stuff. 
french. umm we have a really dumb skit and that culture quiz was crazy. 
after school kyle and laura and i went to alcorn and then we came back and laura and i hung out with trey and scott and evan which was fun.

omg i'm so excited for the chronicles of narnia movie. i've seen the trailer and it looks AWESOME!!!! i loved the books. dad read them all to me when i was little. the movie looks SOOOO good. 
friday we did a speed through for rehearsal where everyone sits around and we say our lines as fast as we can. it was hilarious we were having pillow fights and stuff. 
then me, kari, laura, kyle, and rmax went to go see stars wars, which sucked. screenplay terrible and bad acting. though the lightsaber fights and yoda were awesome.
rehearsal saturday morning. then we went to see star wars again for magnus' b-day. not as bad on second watching cause i wasn't as irritated at anakin. 
came home and studied.

got to school and studied frantically with large group for history test. 
i dominated that french test. o yes i did. hehe. 
chem we learned all these carbon chains with really long unpronouncable names like ""carboxylic acid"" or ""hydroxylated aldehydes"" or ""propylpropanoate"" or ""dimethylethylester"" 
computer. we're basically done so we had a study hall. we spent the whole period with rmax testing me and kyle for the history test.
english. mrs scheinkopf was utterly pissed off today and kept taking it out on me and annie vaughn. 
lunch was fun. it was good but i cant really remember anything funny.
algebra. studied for history with denny and spencer. while they chased each other around the classroom.
history. i dominated that test too. :)
PE WAS AWESOME. we had a free period. so at first nat and laura and kyle and me and krissy were trying to cartwheels and stuff on the field. which was really fun. the study hall people were there too. then we started playing this ancient game called red rover from years ago. its really lame and you stand in two lines facing each other holding hands and you have to run and try and break the chain. so its rather gay. but then the guys spontaneously joined in and it became hilariously fun. so playing were me, kaba, nat, laura, kyle, krissy, daniella, tiffany, neil, ian lee chang, rmax, kyong, and isabella. so it was fun because it was so lame and everybody was staring at us like we had gone out of our minds but we had such a good time. 
then we got our yearbooks and we all sat on the steps and looked at them.
then kyle, laura, nat, tiffany, me, magnus, and rmax went to juice it up. which was really fun and fooz-ball-y.

so today i made the brilliant move of oversleeping by a full hour, unintentionally discovering that i can get ready a hell of a lot faster than i usually do so i can sleep in later now. 
history. kyle and i did our review sheet thing whilst talking in french accents. 
o i love maroon 5. anyways.
PE we had another study hall. memorized that poem for english. then laura and i sat on the steps in the shade and talked for a while. it was fun ;)
during nutrition i was talking to trey and xander and scott and evan and somehow we got on the subject of what would happen to people if a ferris wheel started rolling. interesting...ummmkay. 
algebra we basically listened to music whilst reviewing for our final. 
photo....meh. 
lunch was funny. this truck drove by honking and kyle was like HI and it was hilarious...yeah...
english. poem test. i can still remember it i hope. 

I met a traveler from an antique land
Who said:Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert...Near them, on the sand, 
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown, 
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, 
Tell its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!""
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away. 

yeah. french. laura and i started cracking at the end of class when we were working together cause she hit her head on this pushpin in the wall and her hair got stuck. and andria was going SHHHH and i was thinking you shut up. yeah. 
chemistry. carbon bonds with infinite and confusing names. 
went to the history review after school. 
rehearsal was postponed cause sophie was stuck in traffic and jasmine had a dance audition. so kyle and i ran to alcorn and got food. 
rehearsal was fun i guess. we get really sidetracked. but we had actual candles today. though i ###### up my lines a lot. i felt so dumb.

history we learned about the black death and boils and things.
algebra. ummm yeah.
french we took a quiz i utterly BOMBED and listened to this really gay listening comp thing. ""you are about to hear an involved conversation between camille and a dry cleaner. obviously, there has been a bit of a mix-up."" c'est vraiment bizarre, en?
rehearsal. yeah. well it looks pretty good. except we just start talking during a brief break and then we talk for like half an hour. anyways so we finished blocking my scene with danny. so we kinda dance and then we crash into this table. and then while he's spieling he picks me up and swings me around and then he kisses me and its like ""AWKWARD MOMENT"" and then at the end i'm crying hysterically. yeah.

photo was fun. we tried the raving bit with glowing cellphones which was entertaining.
algebra. we had a free period interspersed with time outs for denny and spencer in the Shame Hat. its a piece of tagboard made into a cone that the person puts on when they are made to sit on the Shame Stool when they have done something shameful. it comes over your face. on the front it says ""shame hat"" and on the back it says ""shame"" on the inside so you cant escape it says ""shame on you for shame"" and on the back of the inside it also says ""shame"" haha.
chem i think i didnt fail that quiz after all. 
PE mrs lashier made us do CV day which sucked cause it was so hot and humid. dad chewed me out tonight at dinner for complaining which was rather tedious. 
lunch was fun. i was practicing that twirly thing rmax taught me with his ruler only occasionally i would drop it and it would fling itself at kyle and she would shriek and stuff. it was eventful. misha and matt gave me and nat this book for our birthday called ""The Guide to the North American Bird"" and the cover is this huge picture of someone flipping someone off and its all these diferent ways to give someone the bird and it was hilarious. 
english. meh. more Catcher in the Rye.

o it was hilarious. rmax was the last person to go because his dad got lost. so we were sitting out in the driveway waiting for his dad. so his dad finally came up the street and started to pull in the driveway so rmax began to walk down the driveway and then his dad thought it wasnt the house so he pulled out and kept going and rmax was going dad what the hell are you doing? so his dad just drove away and it was hilarious so he had to call his dad to get him to come back. it was really funny. 
this morning i had a fencing tournament. there were only nine people in the tournament and eight got medals so that was really cool. i fenced abominably but i got eighth so i still got a medal which was neat.

Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed 
And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright, 
Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light 
Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed: 
And love is fire. And when I say at need 
I love thee...mark!...I love thee--in thy sight 
I stand transfigured, glorified aright, 
With conscience of the new rays that proceed 
Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low 
In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures 
Who love God, God accepts while loving so. 
And what I feel, across the inferior features 
Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show 
How that great work of Love enhances Nature's."

Who is she? I do not know. 
Why does she dance? Do not ask me! -- 
Yet to-day, when I saw you, 
When I saw your eyes troubled with the trouble of happiness, 
And your mouth trembling into a smile, 
And your fingers pull shyly forward, -- 
Softly, in that room, 
The little princess arose 
And danced; 
And as she danced the old house gravely trembled 
With its vague and delicious secret.

          XIV

Like an old tree uprooted by the wind 
And flung down cruelly 
With roots bared to the sun and stars 
And limp leaves brought to earth -- 
Torn from its house -- 
So do I seem to myself 
When you have left me.

          XV

The music of the morning is red and warm; 
Snow lies against the walls; 
And on the sloping roof in the yellow sunlight 
Pigeons huddle against the wind. 
The music of evening is attenuated and thin -- 
The moon seen through a wave by a mermaid; 
The crying of a violin. 
Far down there, far down where the river turns to the west, 
The delicate lights begin to ####### 
On the dusky arches of the bridge: 
In the green sky a long cloud, 
A smouldering wave of smoky crimson, 
Breaks in the freezing wind: and above it, unabashed, 
Remote, untouched, fierly palpitant, 
Sings the first star.

"event","I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said

Fumbling through your dresser drawer forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus:]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

This is not goodbye she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

Fumbling through your dresser drawer forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus]

There's only so much I can do for you
After all of the things you put me through

[Chorus x2]

I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out



today was an interesting day. 
history. notes. how fascinating.
PE we had a free so laura and isa and i walked and talked. and then we went inside and we all piled on the big mat and talked about hot guys. which was definitely fun.
algebra. i got an A on the quiz :)
photo. joey was sitting on the stool against the wall and amanda was sitting on the stool in front of him and jordan was sitting on her and eventually they were all kinda lying on top of joey which was hilarious. 
lunch. it is still the best part of my day since austin's stupidity hasnt ruined anything. 
english. meeh.
french. we watched this hilarious video that tara, amanda, anna, and peter had made which was their version of that music video Qu'est-ce Qui T'amene. 

""there's more to this camoflauge -more than just color and shape.
Who calls now? From the twilight's last gleaming.""

chem. spent the entire class period making some graph.
after school-isa SATAN APPROACHES!!!
rehearsal was fun. its coming along quite wonderfully. 
piano. hehe. 
this survey lady called and spent like ten minutes trying to spell out some dumb thing. and i was just like o. my god. this is crazy.
ugh. catcher in the rye calls. malheuresement. 

Chiarascuro: Rose

          He

FILL your bowl with roses: the bowl, too, have of crystal. 
Sit at the western window. Take the sun 
Between your hands like a ball of flaming crystal, 
Poise it to let it fall, but hold it still, 
And meditate on the beauty of your existence; 
The beauty of this, that you exist at all. 

          She

The sun goes down, -- but without lamentation. 
I close my eyes, and the stream of my sensation 
In this, at least, grows clear to me: 
Beauty is a word that has no meaning. 
Beauty is naught to me. 

          He

The last blurred raindrops fall from the half-clear sky, 
Eddying lightly, rose-tinged, in the windless wake of the sun. 
The swallow ascending against cold waves of cloud 
Seems winging upward over huge bleak stairs of stone. 
The raindrop finds its way to the heart of the leaf-bud. 
But no word finds its way to the heart of you. 

          She

This also is clear in the stream of my sensation: 
That I am content, for the moment, Let me be. 
How light the new grass looks with the rain-dust on it! 
But heart is a word that has no meaning, 
Heart means nothing to me. 

          He

To the end of the world I pass and back again 
In flights of the mind; yet always find you here, 
Remote, pale, unattached . . . O Circe-too-clear-eyed, 
Watching amused your fawning tiger-thoughts, 
Your wolves, your grotesque apes -- relent, relent! 
Be less wary for once: it is the evening. 

          She

But if I close my eyes what howlings greet me! 
Do not persuade. Be tranquil. Here is flesh 
With all its demons. Take it, sate yourself. 
But leave my thoughts to me.

 A Sonnet of the Moon

Look how the pale queen of the silent night 
Doth cause the ocean to attend upon her, 
And he, as long as she is in his sight, 
With her full tide is ready her to honor. 
But when the silver waggon of the moon 
Is mounted up so high he cannot follow, 
The sea calls home his crystal waves to moan, 
And with low ebb doth manifest his sorrow. 
So you that are the sovereign of my heart 
Have all my joys attending on your will; 
My joys low-ebbing when you do depart, 
When you return their tide my heart doth fill. 
So as you come and as you do depart, 
Joys ebb and flow within my tender heart"

The sea is calm to-night.
The tide is full, the moon lies fair
Upon the straits; on the French coast the light
Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand;
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!
Only, from the long line of spray
Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,
Listen! you hear the grating roar
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,
At their return, up the high strand,
Begin, and cease, and then again begin,
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring
The eternal note of sadness in.

Sophocles long ago
Heard it on the A gaean, and it brought
Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow
Of human misery; we
Find also in the sound a thought,
Hearing it by this distant northern sea.

The Sea of Faith
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.
But now I only hear
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,
Retreating, to the breath
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear
And naked shingles of the world.


Ah, love, let us be true
To one another! for the world, which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams,
So various, so beautiful, so new,
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;
And we are here as on a darkling plain
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,
Where ignorant armies clash by night."

"event","this is so incredibly awesome. so our choir tour for the summer after next is to ITALY. FLORENCE. one, that is awesome because florence is the coolest place in the world. two, i found the schedule online and this is utterly awesome. florence, five or so concerts in a bunch of churches and famous places, including san gimignano, the leaning tower of pisa we get to go see and go to ROME and sing in ST PETERS BASILICA and a ton of other really really really really cool things. OMG i cannot wait. this is so wonderful. omg. 
so friday night we went to pollie's concert and she was incredibly good. that was fun. 
saturday morning i went to fencing and i did ok except i lost three or four bouts by one touch which was rather frustrating. we went to the car dealership and test-drove a few cars since mom's lease is almost up. i did some hw and then we had our choir concert which went really really well. The church was packed and the audience was extremely supportive and enthusiastic so that was fun. and we did a really good job. tiff, isa, and magnus came so that was a lot of fun too. 
This morning i had a fencing tournament, the socal youth challenge y-14 foil. it was a mixed event(boys and girls) and it was at fortune fencing. so that was cool except it was absolutely packed. i was the only girl in a pool of seven. i won four bouts and lost two, which is pretty good. the last kid was really annoying cause i've fenced him before. it was 4-4 and i missed the last touch which i utterly HAD cause i thought i hit him and stopped for a split second and he hit me. argh. ah that was annoying. anyways i fenced a lefty and won 5-0 which was cool and i won two others and i had this utterly awesome bout which was so cool cause i was losing 4-1 which is BAD and i made this big comeback and it was tied 4-4 and then we ran out of time and he got priority. which means we have a minute more and if no one scores he automatically wins and I WON cause i got this touch. which was really neat. so that was really cool. 
i was six out of nineteen people and if i had only gotten that one damn touch against that guy i would have been third or fourth. ah. o well it was really fun. i lost my DE 15-9 but it was in the second round and the guy fences in the top class at our club. so i had a really good time. 
then we went to the LACC picnic. which was a lot of fun. i'm going to miss all the guys who're leaving. 
we're going to saladang now for dinner. 
i have to memorize this poem for english. 

Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace.
And saw, within the moonlight of his room,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
An angel writing in a book of gold:-
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
And to the presence in the room he said,
""What writest thou?"" -The vision rais'd its head,
And with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answer'd, ""The names of those who love the Lord.""
""And is mine one?"" asked Abou. ""Nay, not so,""
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,
But cheerly still; and said,"" I pray thee, then,""
Write me as one that loves his fellow men.""
The angel wrote, and vanish'd. The next night
It came again with a great wakening light,
And show'd the names whom love of God had blest,
And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest. 

There's a beautiful song the chamber singers sang. The lyrics are:

Had I the heaven's embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with gold and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths,
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams."

""Did you want to see it used by whining rotters who never rouse themselves to any effort, who do not possess the ability of a filing clerk, but demand the income of a company president, who drift from failure to failure and expect you to pay their bills, who hold their wishing as an equivalent of your work and their need as a higher claim to reward than your effort, who demand that you serve them, who demand that it be the aim of your life to serve them, who demand that your strength be the voiceless, rightless, unpaid, unrewarded slave of their impotence, who proclaim that you are born to serfdom by the reason of your genius, while they are born to rule by the grace of incompetence, that yours is only to give, but theirs is only to take, that yours is to produce, but theirs to consume, that you are not to be paid, neither in matter nor in spirit, neither by wealth nor by recognition nor by respect nor by gratitude -so that they would ride on your rail and sneer at you and curse you, since they owe you nothing, not even the effort of taking off their hats which you paid for?""

damn its a good book. READ IT NOW. 
so is nicholas nickleby. and that movie has some damn good quotes too. theres this one scene where nicholas faces down his uncle for the last time. 
""my bitter, deadly curse on you, boy.""
""your curse holds no power for me now. this day, this very day, ten thousand pounds of your carefully hoarded wealth are gone in one great crash. your sun has set. night comes fast for you.""

or
""we knew no shame until we knew you. you did not want us when we came, and it shamed me to ask help of someone unwilling to give it. the degredations we have endured, whether it be at the hands of a yorkshire schoolmaster, or in the dark box of a theatre, have all served to make our only shame the blood which binds our name to yours. your brother's widow and her children renounce you. may the dark recollections of your life come back to haunt you on your deathbed. when that time may come i do not know, but i know this: from now on, you exist in our lives no longer.""

""there is a struggle taking place outside this mortal temple we call the theatre between those two aged combatants: Art, and Commerce, and it would appear from the receipts that art is once more in its usual position of jeopardy."""

algebra was awesomely cool. mr c. was just like eh i dont feel like teaching today you can have a free. and it was SOOO fun. cause the guys started playing horse with crumpled up paper balls using the paper recycling bin for a basket. and they were going around and everyone had about three letters and about halfway through i asked to play. and i started making them all. i made it five turns in a row. and it was funny cause only me and spencer were left and we went back and forth for about fifteen minutes cause it was pretty even. and soon we both only had to miss one and we were going to be out. and it was really fun. and amazing kinda. so we had to resort to left handed and bank and long distance shots to try and get the other person out. and finally i missed one but it could have gone either way. and it was really awesomely fun.

so afterwards we went home...um ate lunch and practiced piano...god i love gershwin...and helped mom with some school project she was being extremely irritable about...um just got a haircut cause it was getting way too long...

laura and i went up to starbucks after school. so we got food and then we each got our moms some lotiony stuff for mothers day and flowers. so i got my mom a dozen red roses and she got her mom an orchid and that was fun.

then we went to the ATM and thence to subway...hehe...and then we went to best buy and got a CD burner :) and then to chicks where i got another much-needed swimsuit. :) then we went home and i started my hw and basically got nothing done.
went to lacc. sang through the dona nobis a couple of nerve-wracking times. 
now i have to write two pages of my research paper. but that shouldnt be too hard. 
dad's watching master and commander in the other room and at random intervals a terrific noise as of the smashing of multiple plates and the firing of multiple cannons bursts forth.

went to fencing. argh. i started off really well and won three in a row and then i lost to brian by two which was frustrating and to anthony by one cause i missed the last touch and then to laura which was really frustrating. argh. argh. but whatever.

met up with nat and her mom. we had lunch at subway and i was starving so i had a foot long roast beef sandwich and i ate the entire thing and then i went to nats house and we did invitational stuff that was fun and then we were both starving so i had ANOTHER roast beef sandwich which was crazy and i think i'm still hungry.

"event","ITS THE WEEKEND thank jesus. 
i cant really remember yesterday. at all. except i won my pool at fencing. which was nifty. i was losing the first bout four to one and i came back and beat him. hehe. ummm thats all i can remember. 
today at school went by SOOOOO SLOOOOWLY. ugh. 
photo. ugh. 
algebra. ugh. o crap i just remembered i forgot to go get my test. o well. 
history. ugh. 
chemistry. ugh.
lunch. lunch was hilarious. it was really fun.
french. more presentations. i went yesterday and mine was utter crap. i totally failed. but people liked it cause i had really cool pictures. so i dont really know how i did. whatever.
PE. we didnt have to swim. it was so fun. we played basketball and basically did whatever. it was me and nat and claire vs. laura and kaba and daniella and we laughed hysterically the whole time and it was uber fun. 
english. we had to memorize that soliloquy from macbeth and i still remember it. so i feel like writing it out. hehe.

she should have died hereafter.
there would have been a time for such a word.
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
creeps in this petty pace from day to day
to the last syllable of recorded time,
and all our yesterdays have lighted fools
the way to dusty death. out, out, brief candle!
life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
that struts and frets his hour upon the stage
and then is heard no more. it is but a tale
told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, 
signifying nothing. 

hehe. omg i just remembered last night we went to dinner at some mexican restaurant and a waiter was walking by and there were too many plates on the tray and i saw this about to happen and it fell off and hit the side of the table and plate shards went all over my dads food and in his drink and everything and there was food everywhere. so yes. that was interesting.
 
o tonight was so fun. so after school we stayed and watched the boys jv volleyball last game and it was versus poly. i knew some of the people on the poly team. anyways we won and it was super fun cause we were cheering the whole entire time and i'm still hoarse cause we were screaming and everything. and magnus did really well and i'm really glad for him cause he did a great job. taylor's dog got sprayed by a skunk so he reeked of skunk today. he smelled AWFUL and it was hilarious. 

so nat and tiff and laura and i went out tonight. we ate at sushi roki and it was really fun. the food was really good. o yeah so we gave them sixty cause it cost forty and we wanted change for the extra twenty but they didnt understand and they gave us change for sixty dollars and half was in QUARTERS. so we spent fifteen minutes trying to figure out how to pay the bill and it was funny. and we saw hitchiker's guide to the galaxy and i'm still trying to decide whether or not i like it. but we got ice cream afterwards at ghiradelli and walked around and saw the street magicians and stuff and it was SOOO fun. yay!!!

o i'm tired. off to bed i go :)"

"event","today is a good day. 
history test first period. which sucked but was good because i got it out of the way. it was long but it wasn't very hard. so i got to watch the other classes freak out all day. 
PE. she was going to make us swim which would have sucked since it was nine in the morning, FREEZING, and pouring rain. but she took a few looks at our utter misery at changing and took pity and let us play pillow polo instead. :)
algebra. quiz tomorrow. going to be really easy. :)
photo. we did nothing at all. 
lunch. hehe. lunch. it was joyful isa. THRG. at least all the THRG i get nowadays. which isnt much. 
english. macbeth. the scene where macduff finds out about his children. bringing back many memories. 
french. test. there was a power outage during the test. all the lights went off and so did the oral tape with an abrupt whirring noise. it came on again about thirty seconds later and the tape went ""Bienvenue!!"" and it was funny. guess it happened all over school.
chemistry. test tomorrow. thats about five tests this week. 
o yes misha is going to sarah lawrence!!! yay REALLY prestigious fashion design school in new york :)

"event","except for the sixty tests tomorrow, today is a pretty not-bad day. as in nothing awful happened. wait scratch that. 
so this morning senor nunez comes up to me and goes ""i was under the impression that you were in french 1. but since you're in french 2 its going to be much harder for you to switch"" followed by crap about how its not a good idea and i should just stay with french and he has to go talk to the college counselor and my parents and make sure i know the ""repercussions"" of this. so i'm all polite and everything. i just want to take spanish. wtf? i told you three weeks ago i was in french 2. so maybe he really did not hear me. but why would it make a difference? its taken you three frickin weeks to realize this? i've already got everything set up!!! only then it turns out that madame just doesnt want me to leave french and she talked to him which is why he's suddenly changed his mind. wtf? what a bitch. she cant just let me leave? she never calls on me in class anyways so its not like my being gone would leave a gaping hole or anything. jesus. well mom is on my side so we'll see what happens. 
chem. booooring. 
english. macbeth. yay. 
computer. yay programming. so exciting. but i get the hang of it so thats nice. 
PE. swimming actually is really fun. we had to swim for twenty minutes without stopping as a sort of CV day but it was really fun since we could swim however we want. denny screamed my name underwater and totally startled me and it was hilarious. 
lunch. rather disturbing discussion from guys about how the first thing they notice with a girl is figure, preferably curvy. yes rather enlightening in disturbing way. 
history. massive test tomorrow i am really worried about. 
algebra. THRG. how isa do they do this to us? argh.
french. meh. 
history review. 
rehearsal. its looking pretty good. :)
lacc. we sang through the dona nobis for the first time and it is awesomely cool.

"event","yay beck. 
so anywho, this was a ###### of a day. in the not-good sense. mondays. ergh. 
got to school and had to do french hw before it started.
french. ergh. massive project that i am NOT happy about. 
photo. yay i love that class. so today we had a fire drill. and all the classes have to go out to the field and there were all these huge classes but for ours it was just me, matt, joey, and jordan. and after it was over we went back and did hw and they all told really bad jokes and it was really fun. 
algebra. bleeeeeeh. borrring. 
chemistry. alex f. and i dominate the titration lab. yes we do. today was not my day tho. spilled this huge beaker of water EVERYWHERE and it was all soaked and then i stepped on his foot. and it was not my day. but he wasnt mad and we got the answer so that was cool. 
swimming. well the actual swimming was joyful and fun. cept wearing a two piece when diving not good. but i dont have another suit. anyways changing sucks in a locker room resembling a dirty lake. 
lunch. meh. 
english. passage test i didnt know we had. but i think i aced it. and mrs scheinkopf shockingly is the only teacher making a conscious effort to give us less hw because she knows how much we have. and we're reading the witches big scene which is joyful. :)
history. evil research paper. evil. evil. 
after school kyle, laura, tiff, and i all went to juice it up. tiff i dominate at foozball. yes indeed. 
so we ended up not having rehearsal today. thanks sophie for informing me. yeah.
""when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
you'll understand what i mean when i say there's no way we're gonna give up
like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe..."""

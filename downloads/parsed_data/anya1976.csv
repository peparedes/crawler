"event","""for women who are 'difficult' to love.""
Warsan Shire

you are a horse running alone
and he tries to tame you
compares you to an impossible highway
to a burning house
says you are blinding him
that he could never leave you
forget you
want anything but you
you dizzy him, you are unbearable
every woman before or after you
is doused in your name
you fill his mouth
his teeth ache with memory of taste
his body just a long shadow seeking yours
but you are always too intense
frightening in the way you want him
unashamed and sacrificial
he tells you that no man can live up to the one who
lives in your head
and you tried to change didn't you?
closed your mouth more
tried to be softer
prettier
less volatile, less awake
but even when sleeping you could feel
him travelling away from you in his dreams
so what did you want to do love
split his head open?
you can't make homes out of human beings
someone should have already told you that
and if he wants to leave
then let him leave
you are terrifying
and strange and beautiful
something not everyone knows how to love."

I had come home from my boyfriend's (at the time) house around 7am. It was an hour drive from his place to mine. I went to sleep then I woke up to use the bathroom I am not sure what time it was. I have a radio in my bathroom that goes on when the light is turned on and instead of the usual cheerful morning show/music playing they were talking about an attack on buildings and I was not sure what the hell was going on so of course I turned on the tv. I sat there for hours watching. I kept trying to call my boyfriend who ended up sleeping all day and wondered why i was blowing up his phone all day.... I had to tell him to turn on the news. That night I went to his house and we watched the coverage all night long. It was pretty much the same every day that week. The tv was on and I was watching coverage and if I was driving to his place I had news radio on. That friday there was a memorial thing in downtown chicago and I had to be there so my friend and I went down to that."

I love this song so much. Now that I'm older it totally hits a chord.
It also makes me sad knowing now how sick Freddie was when this video was recorded, yet he still had his cheekyness and spirit.

Don't Stop Me Now, These are the days of our lives, Good old fashioned lover boy, one year of love, kind of magic,save me,I want to break free, the show must go on, one vision..
Ok i love lots of queen's songs. I love them for different reasons. Mostly the lyrics and how they make me feel when I listen to them.

I am sitting here at my brother's waiting for the kids to wake up.
This summer has been busy. I mean really busy. I thought i'd have more time to sit around and lay out and stuff. I was completely pale until 4th of july weekend when I got so sunburned it wasnt even funny. I have had a few times to lay out since then so my chest arms and face are pretty tan... my legs eh have a little bit of color.
The kids have been good. Virginia is crawling and believe me she wants to go everywhere now. She's eating more regular food and if you have something you are eating she lets ya know that she wants some too.
Evan is starting the terrible two's. everything is ""mine"" and he's being more defiant. Testing those boundaries. Even though he's acting out a little he's still a pretty good boy.
Ok now my mind has gone blank. Lack of sleep. I slept like shit last night. kept waking up the chinchillas were making noise but of course THEY were sleeping when I had to get up at 8am. little fuckers.
Hopefully tomorrow I do not have to watch the kids. I'd love to catch up on some sleep. I may be going to a wedding with a friend saturday so I also need time to find what i want to wear. 
It's hotter than hell here lately so I also need to figure out what to do with my hair. if it's going to be super hot and humid I want to wear it up but of course I have no bangs so i look like a spinster librarian when I put my hair up... but if it means being cooler I may have to look like that.
Ok I think I will end this here
have a great rest of your week everyone"

"event","I love this. I have been using a sample i got.
it's like coal face but not in a bar and with black sugar added for exfoliation.
This does not dry my skin like coal face did.
The best way to use it is to use it in the shower on a wet face.
before I get in my shower what i do is pinch off what i will use then put it in a place that doesn't get wet. This cleanser is kinda crumbly so if it crumbles pack it back together. I wet my face then make the dark angels into a paste with a few drops of water then apply it to my face and start scrubbing.
This does not aggrivate my eczema. When i get out of the shower I tone with tea tree water toner which I love.

I have been using lots of lush stuff recently."

Oh i have a few... Clue and Grease 2 being a couple of them but The Pirate Movie is seriously one of my absolute faves. I LOVED this movie as a kid and I still love it. It was released for a short time on dvd and (here I need to get another copy since I have played mine so much it has scratches it's unavailable) I introduced it to my cousins and they loved it too. I did find the music for the soundtrack online which took a very long time to find."

I know I have not updated in awhile. I've been busy. I haven't even posted my manicures here in a bit... I do have them on my twitpic and post them on twitter if ya'll follow me.

My birthday is sunday. I cannot believe I am going to be 35. Time fucking flies huh.

I have gotten quite a few presents from one special person. He got me 13 nail polishes and a wall mounted nail polish rack (that was unfortunately damaged in shipping) and my beauty and the beast dvd. I have been truly spoiled. I will probably not really get anything else for my birthday so spoiling me was awesome.
Sunday I need get up early anyway cus the nail polish i have been waiting for will finally be on sale at my ulta. sad and pathetic but with the shatter/crackle craze ya need to get up early to pick up a bottle of the new stuff out.I will be getting a bottle of silver shatter if i have to knock down old ladies to get it.
other than that my weekend is pretty low key.
I have no idea if we are even doing anything for mother's day with my Ma. she didn't say anything so I assume she and my dad are going to the casino or something. 

other than that my life has been busy with kids and all that. I've been getting home late and all I want to do by the time I do get home is relax and watch tv. Damn have i gotten boring in my old age lol

I hope you all have great weekends and mother's days (for you mom's out there)"

I am gonna get hate for this but being a teen in the 90's  I liked nirvana but uum I don't think Kurt was the second coming or anything. The only reason he is treated as such is cus he killed himself.

Michael Jackson is kind of another.... most recently he was the butt of jokes until he died then all of a sudden EVERYONE was a freakin' fan. I listened to his music all my life. I was not crazy insane over him. I liked some of his stuff... but c'mon people you were all just makin fun of him now you are crying cus he's dead.

Courtney Love is another I see getting mondo love... uum I don't see it.

I also think most ""singers"" nowadays who have to rely on autotune or anything is over rated. If you don't have the chops to sound like you do on your cds(without lipsyncing when you are singing ""live"") then ya need to stop and stop now.
I like a few of lady gaga's songs but would I bother to buy her cds or pay to see a concert? uum no. I don't think she's as unique as the kiddies do.

Most of this crap they play on the radio is why I constantly keep cds in my cd player and hardly ever listen to ANY radio."

I just had disc 2 of matchbox twenty's exile on mainstream in my car cd player since I took the christmas cd out after christmas. I tend to put something in the car stereo and leave it. I put Pink's greatest hits in there the other day though.... so we'll see how long she lasts lol. I'm sure you are glad you don't have to drive anywhere with me daily."

"event","I ended up cutting my nails 2 weeks ago cus i had a break that just was not patching correctly with silk wrap.

China Glaze has a crackle nail polish collection... kinda like the OPI shatter but with colors... there is of course black,white,grey, pink, teal,purple. 
This stuff works pretty much like the shatter it depends on how much pressure you put on the brush when you apply I find when I don't put much pressure I get the least amount of shatter/crackle (I have found this on both OPI and the China Glaze). It also depends on how much polish you have on the nail.. I personally like a more medium layer not too thin cus I want the shatter color to be opaque and I do like bigger cracks. the thinner the coat the smaller and more cracks you get. I kinda like the fewer bigger cracks.
I personally like the brush on the china glaze ones better than the opi. My nail beds are longer and thinner so a smaller brush works better for me. I used the purple and pink colors and found that with the colors you can see and make sure the polish isn't drying and gumming up at the top of the bottle.  I will have to use it a few more times to see how that compares though. I generally try to just take the brush out of the bottle long enough to do one nail. I put the brush back in the bottle often and i close it but not twist just to keep from being in the air too long.
OPI is supposed to be releasing a silver and white shatter color... I don't think I am gonna get the white cus I have the china glaze white.... but the silver I WILL be getting if I need to sleep in my car in front of the store on the release date.

The base color i used was Nubar Vaso and on the ring finger I used china glaze coconut kiss it was the closest purple i had to the fault line crackle color. It needs to be a tad deeper but it is pretty close, i must say.

"event","My nephew and niece and sister in law and brother are all sick. my SIL thought my brother was going to work today so she had me go with to the doctor's office. My nephew did not want me to put him down the whole time. he's had a fever on and off since thursday. he's not been congested or anything. Virgina has a runny nose and sneezing. She's got what gayle has had. Turns out Evan has strep throat. when I had to put him down for the doc to check his throat he would not let her see. she did his other checking while I held him. which was good.but finally she did get him to open his mouth and saw his tonsils and of course they were not pretty. I feel bad for the kid since I had strep a lot during jr high and high school.
Tomorrow will be interesting since I will be all alone with two sick kids. Hopefully they both nap a lot. Today kev didn't end up working soooo i pretty much left after kevin went to pick up ev's meds. he didn't want to be put down so i held him til he took his first dose. 
Let me just say he's a strange kid. He likes taking medicine. When he's had to take the baby tylenol he loves it. if he see's the bottle he cries until you give it to him. then he likes to hold the bottle.
Other than sick kids, life has been pretty much the same. I started rewatching grey's anatomy. I watched season one and two  over the weekend. i am onto season 3. I need to buy season 4 since it's the only one I don't have. I will probably pick that up this weekend..... if i don't finish season 3 before then.
Well.. it is almost 2am and I have to get up and get my booty over to kev and gayle's in the morning so I need to go.
Have a good rest of the week everyone."

China Glaze Pink Voltage and Turned Up Turquoise. I was gonna do flying dragon on the accent nail but I thought that might be too dark.
I used nail magic as a base then like 4 coats of the color then the black shatter polish and then seche vite 
with the shatter you need to make sure the color is completely dry for it to ""shatter"""

"event","I have been wanting to use this nail polish BUT i had read if you use it to top other colors it looks even better sooo this week instead of using it on it's own I used barielle's elle's spell over black and china glaze's phat santa. Elle's spell on it's own is a raspberry color that looks much deeper an vampier in the bottle with flakies in it. the flakies shine yellow red and green depending on how the light hits it.
I got a very lubu heels kinda vibe from it over the black but instead of just shining red it shines all different colors in the light. over phat santa it does remind me of opi's ali's big break but instead of just having a gold shimmer it shines all different colors depending on how the light is hitting it and the position of my finger. This time I wanted to try it with cream bases instead of using a shimmer polish under... next time I may use something with more shimmer. I've read it works really well over purple polishes.

i used nail magic for my base  and sherrani tufcoat plus for my topcoat and I did a coat of european secrets never chip which is a topcoat for the topcoat that i love but cannot find anywhere to buy.
I have been having great luck keeping polish on for at least 7 days with minor tipwear and very minimal chips. I do try and refresh topcoat halfway thru the 7 days. but i don't keep applying topcoat like some people every day or so. I like to be more laid back about maintaining polish.

Granted I have a couple patches on a few nails BUT the nails that are not patched wow super strong. I shaped my pointer fingers and took a teeny bit of length off some nails yesterday (I wanted them to match more in length and be more uniform). I broke my thumbnail NYE so now that will have to grow out. But when shaping my nails i could tell how much stronger they were without nail polish. I need to take a picture of my nails without polish  so you can see how my natural nails look.

this week I wanted to do a matchy glitter and polish color... after I did my nails I thought maybe I should have used simmer and shimmer the blue glitter but I kinda like the matchy matchyness.

I also gave myself a pedi this week the color on my toes that I used is China Glaze tuned up turquoise  with fairy dust over it and on my big toes i used sally hansen extreme wear - in the spotlight  I need to take a pic of the pedi the pic i did take before was before the edges were cleaned up.

"event","Ok it's been awhile since I've updated. This christmas holiday has been fun. I spent NYE with Gayle and the kids. We watched all 3 toy story movies. I ended up breaking my thumb nail. I was changing batteries on the ps3 remote thing and it cracked. It didn't look that bad but when I got home and took the polish off to patch it it was cracked all across almost to the other side so I just cut it. My left thumb nail usually grows pretty fast unlike the right one (for some reason) so hopefully it'll look nice again soon.
Yesterday we went out to dinner with gayle and the kids. Kevin is out of town snowboarding. He should be home tomorrow he left last weekend. He called begging me to be able to help Gayle with the kids while he was away. We had Evan over night thursday night then I brought him home friday night and of course hung out til the movies were over.
Today I have nothing to do. I may give myself a pedicure. i have to do some laundry so I may do that too. I woke up way too early for a sunday... but then I was up early yesterday and was in bed before midnight last night."

"event","I tried to show some of the dimension here. This orly color reminds me of my beloved sally hansen nail prisims (my fave was/is turquiose opal ) I really loved the sally hansen ones I just wish my color was still around (I actually still have a bottle or two, I just use it sparingly). While I like the color of the sally hansen one better this orly space cadet is reminiscent of it. The base color is a golden olive green instead of the blue of the sally hansen. It has similar flashes of color as my hands move which was why I was attracted to it. I may have to swatch both colors for a comparison pic. It took 4 coats to get opacity which in all honesty was the same for the SH but this orly collection was mondo expensive 10 dollars a pop for the cosmic fx collection. I know the SH was not that expensive. I've heard hard candy has a dupe the color is called beetle. I have not tried it so I cannot confirm this but if you cannot find this collection or just do not wanna spend 10 bucks on polish get that one. I got it at ulta they had a lot of the cosmic fx polishes left and I had been lemming this one since I saw it at sally beauty supply months ago but did not get before it was off the shelves (it was cheaper at sally's).

"event","I am absolutely flabbergasted at the number of people rehashing the same old arguments against gay marriage. ""Oh, it'll destroy the institute of marriage..."" How exactly will two people loving each other destroy it?! It's a viewpoint without foundation, hokum at best and discrimination and bigotry at the worst. ""It's an institute ordained by God"" Oh please, marriage has never been the sole purview of religious institutes and for the record there are plenty of religions that recognise gay marriage. I see that the CoE has brought out the old ""creation of children and passing on biological inheritance"" so I guess childless marriages and adoption should also not be allowed under law then either?! I get it , it's change and change can be scary but discrimination is not the answer."

A fourway decision this time, the winner being Badlands by Bruce Springsteen. No other song represents the defiance against all odds to me. The Boss at his very best: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFAr2AbvvF8. It always me feel that no matter how bad things will get for me, I will always find the strength to get up again (Born to Run makes me feel the same way actually). More than anything both those songs exude hope to me.

The ones that fell by the wayside : Bird of Paradise (Snowy White: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBXTNAdvGKI), Bad (live version by U2) and Born to Run (Bruce Springsteen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxuThNgl3YA)"

"event","People that know me , know I like watching TV. 

Over the years I've seen a lot of TV shows come and go, and there have been quite a few I enjoyed tremendously. Some enough to involve myself as a fan. I've seen a lot of TV shows that I loved cancelled or come to an end: The X-Files (though to be fair it had come to the end of its life), Millenium, Futurama (the clever cousin of the Simpsons), Judging Amy (which introduced me to Khelil Gibran), Joan of Arcadia, Firefly (the best work Joss Whedon has ever done), Buffy, Angel, Enterprise (season 3 & 4 were the best star trek since tng!), NYPD Blue (the first series before David Caruso became a caricature), Carnivale, Inspector Morse (RIP John Thaw), Arrested Development, Pushing Daisies,etc etc

But now and then something comes along on TV that really speaks to you. Eli Stone was that show for me. On paper it sounds like a knock off of Ally McBeal: <i>""the show starred Jonny Lee Miller in the title role of attorney Eli Stone. In the first episode, Stone is discovered to have an inoperable brain aneurysm which is causing hallucinations. His acupuncturist, Dr. Chen, suggests that his hallucinations are actually divinely inspired visions of the future."" </i> but it was anything but that. It was uplifting, moving, the story writing was spot on. They could have so easy made it a cringeworthy comedy hour by having the hallucinations put Eli in all sorts of embarassing situations. Whilst that did occassionally happen, it was to advance the story.

The real focus of the show are Eli's interpretations of his ""visions"". Are they sent by God and is he a prophet or are they just the product of his brain malfunctioning? The question is never really answered and it doesn't really matter, what matters is Eli's faith in them as they guide him to make the world a better place for everyone. I watched the series finale last night and it was gutwrenching, though it provide a closure of sorts. 26 episodes is all we got. 

For me, Eli Stone was more than just a TV show I really loved. It held a mirror up to me and makes me wonder about faith, religion, God and what I can / should do with my life. It wasn't a perfect show but then which show is? Just like any medium, the things you love are the ones you can relate to. Sometimes it's because it brings back memories that you cherish, sometimes because it challenges you to be more than you are and to be what you can be and sometimes because you can just lose yourself in it. For me, Eli Stone had all of that. Some of you might think it's sad that a tv show can have that effect on me, but so be it. 

So long, Eli. I've greatly enjoyed your company."

"event","It's been ages since I last updated this properly and a lot has happened since my last proper update (heart problems, getting engaged, grandma in the hospital) and perhaps I will blog about all of these soon, but this is about something else.

For the last week I've been feeling myself standing on the precipice of a deep dark pit. One thing I do whilst being on a downer is deny myself things that I know would cheer me up. Yesterday morning I was adamant I would do this. The thing I was going to deny myself? A Bruce Springsteen gig. Thanks to Rachael's persistence I did eventually decide to go after all and I can't describe how glad I am that I did.
<lj-cut text=""gushing review"">
What can I say? Seeing Springsteen live in concert is the closest thing I've ever had to a religious experience. To paraphrase Jon Landau: I've seen the past, present and future of Rock'n'Roll and their name is Bruce Springsteen. A near 3 hour set, with hardly any breaks between songs (during outro you could hear Bruce shout 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 and the E-street band would break out into the next song), it was breathtaking. My expectations were quite high, based on all the hype but he easily surpassed them all. Sure the band might have missed a note here and there, but as live performances go, it was flawless.

Particular highlights for me were (in no particular order)

* a blistering rendition of Radio Nowhere
* the immense cheering that went up everytime Clarence ""Big Man"" Clemons came to the fore
* THE best version of ""Because the Night"" I've ever heard. I know Patti Smith co-wrote it with Bruce but last night it was very much a Springsteen song
* the crowd singing and dancing along to most of the songs (I've never been to such a diverse concert, teenagers were mingling with OAPs)
* I've never seen anyone work a crowd like Springsteen did

In true Bruce tradition, he kept his best known songs till the last. Badlands closed the regular set and the stadium was shaking during it. The crowd kept singing the chorus to Badlands till the band came back for the encores. If I thought that the crowd could not get more excited I was so very wrong : Thunder Road followed by Born to Run , Glory Days, Rosalita and Dancing in the Dark (by that time I had pretty much lost my voice!). Eventually they closed the set with American Land from the Seeger Sessions, a bluegrass song with strong irish folk roots. As I said to my friend: ""only Springsteen can close a set with a stadium dancing a jig"". 

I like lots of music and I often have an emotional reaction to it but never like this. It's been an amazing week: I got engaged to a wonderful woman and I got to see one of my heroes live. Life is good.

For those that care, here's the full set list:

Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out
Radio Nowhere
The Ties That Bind
Lonesome Day
The Promised Land
Magic
Atlantic City
Reason To Believe

After some initial frustration (one of the staff kept claiming the screen wasn't ready, even up till 15 min after supposed start time!), I got in and found to my dismay that it had already started! 

JFK in a speech to Special Joint Session of Congress in 1961:
<blockquote><b>I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving thegoal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon andreturning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in thisperiod will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for thelong-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult orexpensive to accomplish.</b></blockquote>

Jim Lovell on Apollo 8 being changed from a Earth Orbit test to a Lunar flyby:
<blockquote><b>It was a bold move, it had some risky aspects to it, but this was a time when we made bold moves</b></blockquote>

The movie/documentary itself was ... emotional, awe-inspiring and cathartic. There was no narrative, just very rare NASA footage interspersed with interviews with 10 of the 24 astronauts that went to the moon (Michael Collins, Jim Lovell, Charlie Duke, John Young, Eugene Cernan, Alan Bean, Buzz Aldrin, Dave Scott, Edgar Mitchell and Harrison Schmitt), 8 of them walked on the moon. It starts from Kennedy's speech committing the US to putting a man on the moon by the end of the sixties and follows it through to Apollo XVII, the last time someone set a foot on the moon. Hearing Michael Collins talk about he felt when he was orbiting the moon out of radio contact with Houston : <i>the feeling was not loneliness, but as awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation""</i>.[some people had said of his day of solo flying around the moon: ""not since Adam has any human known such solitude""]. I listened as Alan Bear gushed in admiration for Neil Armstrong, saying he could not have taken the burden of being the first man on the moon; or Buzz Aldrin describing that before he jumped of the final rung of the ladder he took care of some minor bodily function. They were funny, humble, proud, inspiring and above all fragile. I felt absolutely humbled watching them talk. Such a shame that the makers couldn't coax Neil Armstrong out of seclusion. Whilst the NASA footage was absolutely amazing , the real showstealers were the astronauts. Nearly all of them seemed to have acquired a sense of profound spiritualism since they walked on the moon.

Michael Collins at one point in the movie says the following:
<blockquote><b>People, instead of saying ""well you Americans did it"", everywhere we went they said ""We did it, we the human race, we the people did it"". And I thought that was a wonderful thing.</b></blockquote>

In a time when politics are dividing everyone, when everyone is afraid of everyone else, it is only grief that brings people together anymore. The moonlandings were the last great uniter in joy for mankind, I just hope it won't be the last. It makes me wish for the days of heroes and hope."

<I>When he was thunder in the hills the villagers lay dreaming harvest behind shutters. 
When he was an avalanche of steel the cattle began to low, mournfully, deeply, and children cried out in their sleep. He was an earthquake of hooves, his armor a dark tabletop of silver coins stolen from the stars, when the villagers awakened with fragments of strange dreams in their heads. And he entered the narrow streets, and no man saw his eyes behind his vizor.</I>"

Now and then I reread books I've enjoyed in the past. A few of you know that <a href=""www.dansimmons.com"">Dan Simmons</a> is one of my all time favourite authors. This quote taken from a short story in the Lovedeath (Liebestod) collection is so memorable that I feel compelled to read it over and over again.

<I>The fundamentalists are outraged that something as sacred and important as life could be an accident.They want it to be a result of a command, a plan, a blueprint, a simple orderly, well-engineered, easily understood project designed by a deity who would figure out all tolerances and fudge them by a safety factor of five or ten.

Well fuck them.

Accidents happen.We're one of them.

We're one of them. But our loving each other is not an accident.Nor our enjoyment of the days we have together. Nor our anxieties for each other and our fear of sharp edges when our children learn to walk. But sometimes we have to be brave and hurl ourselves headfirst into space,knowing that someone we love will be there to catch us if they can.</I>

"event","Not since Lord of the Rings, have I been looking so forward to a movie as Superman Returns.

From the first teaser trailer (essentially the Planet Krypton march set to Jor El monologue from the first movie and select scenes from the movie) I was enthralled. Whilst I prefer the Dark Knight over the Man of Steel, when it comes to movies it's the other way around. 

I finally saw it last friday and it was everything I hoped it to be. Kate Bosworth makes a great Lois (I was never that fond of Margot Kidder).
Kevin Spacey gave Lex Luthor a whole new dimension (is this guy actually capable of giving a bad performance!?) making him actually far more evil than the bumbling conman played by Gene Hackman.
And Brandon Routh, what can I say about him? His likeness to Christopher Reeve is uncanny and like the late Mr Reeve, he makes this role his own.

But really this cartoon sums it up a lot better than I could ever describe this movie: <a href=""http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=20060702"">Superman Returns</a>"

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

First of all there is work (cfr my <a href=""http://frankblack.livejournal.com/89306.html"">my post last night</a> and no doubt a future post). 

But this isn't about that.

This morning on the way to work I got nearly run off the road by a white van. I had to slam the brakes and go up the pavement to avoid crashing into him. He was driving way too fast and recklessly. (I was doing a mere 30 miles / hour on a 40 road due to traffic congestion). So I honked the horn at him. Anyways that pissed me off enough. Then a bit further down the same road the traffic comes to a standstill, and I pull up behind him. He gets out of his van and starts shouting abuse at me. In what's probably my wisest decision of my life, I stay in the car and pretend he doesn't exist. He gets back in his van and starts backing it up towards me at quite some speed.

Luckily by that time, traffic had moved on and people behind us starting honking their horns so he had to drive on.

Gah it pisses me off so much. Part of me just wishes I had kicked his arse and told him to get some manners."

"event","<p>So I'm in my class, having finished my candy; in that moment you just ate a whole lot of sugar, waiting for that moment of hyperness...Well it's valentine's day, you should eat as much candy as you can, righ? Ofcourse you'll have&nbsp;to be in charge of your self whenever you get hyper and feel like doing weird things. Like I said, that moment waiting for the bust just went by anfd now im very hyper; hopefully I'll be able to&nbsp;mantain my self from doing weird crazy stuff. There hasn't been many things going on lately just the normal, so I&nbsp;pretty much&nbsp;don't h ave much to talk about except to tell some story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

"event","The word hero dosen't mean that you NEED to have special powers. It could mean that you believe in someone greatly and that you show respect towards them. Many children consider thir parents as their heroes, teen agers consider their friends as heroes even parents consider their children as&nbsp;heroes.&nbsp;I personally dont have a hero although I still look up at people that have done something important."

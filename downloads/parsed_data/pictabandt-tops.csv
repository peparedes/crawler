"event","This is exactly the same entry i put in here not too long ago. and apparently it was not read by the right people. so here it is, I just hope that it is read by the right people this time. and for all of the people who are reading this again my best advice is to change your settings if at all possible to block anyone and everyone that could be a threat to you. 


I feel as if I should have something to say in here. I feel as if I have this journal and it should be used. I should be able to write what I want to write and not have it taken out of context. I mean after all this is a place to voice my thoughts, my emotions, my feelings. A place where I can say what I need to say and know that noone is going to pay any real attention to it for this is just a journal. But the truth of the matter is is that most people read into what a person writes. I do it to others, I know it gets done to me. The difference is if I have any questions or thoughts, I take it to the person who wrote it, not to everyone else. I don't spead it around like gossip. I don't tell others to read it. If they find it so be it. But what I write in here or my other journal is for me. I write in here for it is easier than a paper journal to me. I write here for I can delete if i want to and not see the reminder of it. This journal is for me. Your journal is for you. And if I want to say Fuck you in here I can, for that is my thought at that mooment. And you should not take it personally for you do not know who i said fuck you too. People need to know that this is a place to release emotions. If you can not handle that then you should not be reading it. 

This is mine, and no one knows why I wrote what I wrote but me. And it will stay that way. For I know that after reading what you all just read you understand that this is mine, not yours to spread around. And if I want anyone in particular to read it I will ask them to do so."

What is so appealing about them? What do they do for you? Maybe I am high on life, love, and nature. Maybe that is a drug in itself. But why do people do drugs? Is it an escape? Is it a different place you end up? But if you ask me when you come off of it you end up right back where you left and that doesn't solve anything? Is it one of those things where you are doing it because someone else is doing it and you thought hey they might notice me or I will fit in if I do drugs? I just don't understand.

I can say that was probably one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. In the truest sense of the word it represented camp. Camp at is best. Minus the alcohol. It was a movie about some kids doing something they love,  helping each other, forming a community that we so love about camp. A group of kids having fun, growing, struggling. All of them wanting to be normal, and realizing that normal is not ever going to be possible. Normal does not exist. Normal is what they can never be, for they are better than that.

This movie was wonderful, heart felt, moving. Thank you to the person who told me about it. Thank you for wanting to see something wonderful, for telling me about it."

I made two batches of cookies, one chocolate chip the other M&M, I bought dafodills, I wore a hat or two at one time depending on when, I talked to my aunt that I never see and told her that I was happy, and she thought I was nuts, A really great friend told me I am so random, which is so true, and I watched american idol, which i can't stand. Ohh and I made dinner and it was done just as my grandmother pulled into the driveway. Nothing like perfect timing. Ohh and i was looking at the JC Penny Catalog and picked out this orange shirt my grandmother is going to get me.

Can I tell you the dafodills are so fantastic, they just brightened my day. So i went into the store and there they were right in front of me. And i was so lost, I had to call my old roomamte and ask how to choose flowers, I told her out of all the girly qualities I inheritated choosing flowers was not one of them, she always did that for me. I just went with the ones I likes, which as I have come to learn is the way to go. They were 10 flowers for $1.50. $1.5o for a day and more of happiness, and smiles, cheer. Ohh it was so fantastic, and so random for me.

The cookies, really I normally make chocolate chip when i give them away, this time, M&M. It was so colorful, it was fantastic. 

Today is a day for color and spring. I loved it. 

Today is National Randomness Day as far as I am concerned. I wonder if there is anyway to make that come true? Hmmm."

"event","I just got offered a job to work at camp this summer. I would be in charge of staff(counselors). It is an all summer job. Unfortunatly I would be in Az. It pays what I am making now so that is not a problem. 

I don't know.

I just don't want to be in Az this summer, but it is a good oportunity. One I would love to have. Something tells me that when something comes up twice in your life and you turn it down once there is a reason, but when it comes back to you later, there is a reason for that too. I think i need to go. I told her to send me the info. 

I think I am nuts. God save me now, but I think I may do it."

"event","I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh it sounds good to me
(I said) Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you
I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh it sounds good to me
Yes it sounds so good to me
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you
I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
Oh it sounds so good to me
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Closer to you"

I will not promiss you any interesting entries, I will give you my life. That I am sure is all you can really ask for anyway. Although some might want more.

I will not lie, I will not try to impress you with the glamorous stuff, or try to convince you that I am fabulous, Although given time I am sure that will be proven anyway.

Basically I work, sleep, talk, eat, love, and live. Anything else is extra on any given day. And I like the extras. So stick around and find out what they are."

"event","I love shopping for the holidays. I love buying presents, I always love to find the perfect gift for someone. Although Christmastime is always kind of lonely and sad for me, I am usually happy shopping, as weird as that sounds.

I've been thinking lately. In August I went to Canada with Kate, Katii and Josh. It was the best time of my whole life. We had such an amazing experience. It was so well planned and we had so much freedom. Everything was up to us. And we did it all. The car ride up was tedious but it was a lot of fun. When we finally go there we had so much shit and had to sweet talk our way into the hotel. I can remember those drunk nights so clearly. Dancing and taking shots and dancing in the clubs. It was amazing. We had no restrictions and we could do whatever we wanted. It was the best thing ever. I can't wait to go back again. 

Sometimes I wonder if I'm even cut out for a relationship. I mean, I get so worked up about the stupidest little things. But I can never tell him whats bothering me because I feel like a jealous bitch. Some of me feels like he owes me, and that he shouldn't be acting like this. Sometimes I think he shouldn't have done a lot of things he's done. In comparison to my friend's relationships I feel like such a wimp. But there's always the other hand. I'm doing the same shit he's doing, if not worse, and he lets me have the freedom I want. He never gets jealous or angry or upset. I really wish I didn't but I can't stop. I can't help but feel that 8 months should feel more important than this. But I don't relaly know what to do about it. I don't really know what to say. And the fact that he replaced my picture with an ex-girlfriend's is just shitty. I really can't believe it and I just can't get the words out to tell him. I mean it's his room, he should be able to do what he wants with it. I also feel ike 8 monthes maybe he should have the decency to respect what we have. I don't know. It's confusing. I get so mad at him sometimes, but I love him so much that I can easily forget about  it. I can't help but love him...

I took my GED test last night. Never have I felt like more of a loser. Oh my god.

I'll try to keep this thing updated a little more often."

"event","things keep hitting me at the speed of light. i am so baffled and bewildered i feel like a deer in headlights. my moods have been so odd lately, i've been feeling strangely emotionless. i don't have strong feelings towards much of anything anymore, i'm more open and accepting. it kind of makes me wonder if the birth control really is plaing around with the emotions inside. in which case, i don't know what i'd do because i kind of like being not so emotional. it's hard to explain and im really not one with words. writing them down anyways.

so what are you really supposed to do when someone tells you that they're in love with you? it was a struggle but i gave up those emotions almost a year ago, and although they seem familiar i know they're not. it's heart breaking for me to have to tell someone that. and deffinatly not an easy task. here's a life lesson though, such strong feelings shouldn't be kept inside. and i give him major credit for that because i don't know how he did it for so long. just bottled up inside. i know it's selfish of me but, i never was able to understand people who can't talk to other people about themelves, or about things on their mind. i don't know where i would be if i was't able to tell someone every stupid feeling i have. it may be just me but, i give them lots of credit for being so strong inside. and i give myself credit for not having reoccuring feelings that might sway any judgement. i am okay now, and i've recovered and i just feel so guilty for making someone feel that way about me when i just can't return the same feeling. life's harsh.

tonight i think i had the best conversation with a boy that i have ever had. i think that we broke up because i wasn't feeling loved enough to be in a relationship. i don't know what i was expecting to feel, but i know now that everything i had was the best he could to give me. and to give it another chance. tonight i realized that he does have problems discussing the feelings he has but i know that he does care enough. and knowing that he was on the verge of losing what he thought was the best thing going for him in his life was scaring him. but it was an amazing feeling. and i ralized that i needed him too. i still think that we are better friends than an acutual couple, but he told me we can work on that. and that he actually may love me. i can realize now that these emotions can be a lot harder to discuss for other people, and i learned that from another person that i was once pretty close to. lets juts say that i've had a very thoughtful week. i've learned some life lessons and i've learned simply how to let go.

thats really it for now, i just had to let this go somewhere. it feels good to talk shit out every onvce and a while even if it's with the computer. this is something i can look back on. later dudes~"

i had the best fourth of july. i know we haven't been together for a long time but i thin that we've both changed each other. normally my idea of a good time would be getting shitfaced at some beach watching fireworks then passing out at someones house. and while there's nothing wrong with that i just wasn't up to it this year. so we went to the bach a little late (he had to work) and caught some fireworks people were lighting off on the beach. we brought a blanket and chilled there for a good hour or so, and dare i say it was romantic?  we talked about everything, but mostly about when we were kids. i like how there's things that he can tell me about his childhood that i can relate to, our families are pretty differnt. all in all, it was a good night. we have fun together. i'm happy.

alright well i've started my two jobs. the cleaning one is okay, concidering its 10.00$ an hour. panera is okay because the people are nice. but ast least now i can make some money and pay back my parents. finally.

i have to go to work. i'll write soon."

i don't know why i hvae changed so much in these past few monthes. i was doing so good for so long, and i knew that i'd crash, i just didn't think it would be this bad, or for so long. i have been feeling incredibly guilty lately, i haven't talked to my dad in like 2 weeks. i just haven't been motivated at all to do any school work whatsoever, and i just end up getting pre occupied with other things. not having a job has taken such a burden off of my back, but lack of having any money is a pain. i know i'm getting myself more and more into trouble, and i just don't know what to do anymore. hopefully this summer will change things.

so i never thought that i'd grow so attached, but sometimes i can be driving and just smile. and it's because i'm happy. i really like him. he tells me he misses me. he tells me he's happy to see me. the best part is that he calls me his girlfriend in front of his friends, his baby sometimes. and as corny and dorky as that sounds, it feels so good to hear. it makes me feel so wanted. and that is such a good feeling. being able to just fall asleep in someone else's arms is so comforting. being able to wake up next to someone that likes you and wants you around is even better. i've never experienced anything like this before. it's amazing. what else can i say?

concert tonight. boston traffic again. haha oh well. it's an adventure.

this summer i need to start looking at colleges. i'm really thinking canada. the exchange rate is really good, and it's not boston. i don't want to feel so cramped by my father, because i know he'll stop by and want me home every weekend. is thaty what i really want out of college? i don't know what i want out of college yet. i wouldn't mind doing the four years just for the education then find something i love doing and look into it. right now i'm thinking forgein affairs and world studies. something along with human rights. this world is getting more and more interesting..."

and just for the record, you would have thrown an apology that night right out the window. i figured i'd wait a little while so you wouldn't totally rip my head off, which is understandable. i've fucked things up. i know i have. what i can say now is that i hope your an easy going person, and though it won't be forgotten, it will be understood. that's how i would have felt. i'm sorry, but i know that probably means shit to you.

Everyone needs to grow. It's been most important to me lately though. And I don't mind it. Love, everyone needs to feel loved. I really don't know what I would do if I didn't know at least one person didn't love me. I'm not talking being IN love or loving one of the stupid crushes i have every other week, I'm talking about loving the people who are most important to me. The ones that can understand when I'm having a bad by the one word answers or the subtle or not so subtle hints. The ones that know that I know I've fucked up, but forgive me anyways. The ones who push me on past what I think are my limits. They encourage and give me hope. And I want to say I do the same. That kind of love. Not like you love that kid in your english class or your new shirt. The way I love my friends because they love me because thye understand me. And happiness. I figure if you're not happy you really can't achieve anything else. NOt that I concider myself an extremly happy person at ALL, but I think I'm happy enough. Happy enough to be able to feel other things that make me happy.

"event","Let's see... Valentines Day, not a surprise, sucked. Seriously, I've never had a valentine, so it didn't btoehr me that much this February. I left my lights on, which required a jump start. Saturday night i hung out with Katii, and I actually had a really fun time, not like that surprised me. Sunday I was incredibly hung over, but thats no surprsise since i spend the whole night throwing up every ounce of food I ate in the last 24 hours. Sunday night I slept at Ashley's which is always fun. The thing I miss most about living in Ipswich is not bieng able to just hang out. You know, the kinda of hanging out where you can just sit and talk or watch a movie or just sleep but not be by yourself. I've spent a lot of time by myself recently. Oh yea, Ash got pulled over. PO! Yea, that was scary. Monday was that huge snowstorm. It took 5 hours to go to New Hampshire and get back when it should have taken 2. Fuck that. Then my car started acting up. That's time number one. Tuesday night we took the Jeep out to the beach. AH. Can I possibl have any mroe car problems? (Least I wasn't driivng) It was fun, regardless. Cockeyed Steve added to the fun. (Hey, you liked him) Wednesday Molly and Jess came back and we stopped at that stupid BK and got like 25 chicken nuggets shaped like stars and lightning bolts and the occasional dinosaur. Thursday night, my car broke. Time number 2. We watched Igby Goes Down, which I enjoyed, even there really was no point. The Rules of Attraction sucked, or I was too tired to really undrestand it. Saturday night my mom went away and I hung out wiht Katii. I ended up going through this huge puddle, flooded my engine and had to get it towed Sunday morning. Saturday ngiht the tow truck man gave us a ride home, and Sunday we took a taxi. That weekend was insane. And the tow truck guy was cute, but it set me back 45$. Not like I can exaclty spare money right now.

All in all I had fun. But I'm looking for a new car. A newer car, maybe.

I wish I didn't like him because it would be so much easier. I don't even know why I like him, we're kind of differnt. And I don't see this going ANYWHERE, any time soon. Maybe I should side with Molly and call it quits. Eh. This always happens to me. Or do I always do this to myself?

i'm so insanely messed up sometimes. for example, right now i'm totally satisfied with my life. im totally satisfied with staying home on a friday night. i'm satisfied that i'm alone again and i guess i'm kind of starting to like it. i'm happy with the way thing are going in school. and at home. i'm happy with the few good friends that i really have. there are some people that i'm just happy that i know. i'm pretty lucky. 

then again, tomorrow could totally change things.

it's funny because i don't really know if it's just me being me anymore. i don't know if i really <i>know</i> myself. i mean i've always been on medication, so i don't kno if this is really me or if i'm slipping into one of my depression spurts again. things are going to get fucked up in the next few years though.

sometimes i get so frustrated that i don't have lots of friends here, or that i don't know a lot of people, or a lot of people don't know me. but i'm lucky for the people that i do know. and i'm doing so much better than i would have done in ipswich. i'm being more social to differnt types of people and i'm so happy with the results. i know i have a friend in every one of my classes, and thats comforting. i guess things will just happen. if i let them and stop fussing about them happening. maybe i will even get my way. 

you know when you get so drunk you can't walk or talk and all you can do is throw up? and the morning after you wake up and can't think stragiht? i want to get drunk like that. just because."

do what makes you feel happy. who am i to judge, let alone say anything or comment on your actions? i don't like it when people do it to me, and there's no reason why i should be doing it anyways. i should stop being so damn cynnical and criticing. some people are cool shit for doing those things that are fun. i should be more like that. i'd like to me more innocent and carefree than i really am."

"event","damnit. sometimes i hate the things that come out of my mouth.

some people tell me to look ahead for the future. other people tell me to focus on the present. well, i can't manage to do either right now. it seems like every move i make is the wrong one in the rwong direction. i don't know how much attention i should be paying to my past. i hate how i feel like i have no control anymore. i don't think i've had any control these past few years. and i do try to live in the present. but it's so hard. and i try not to have any regrets. but i always do anyways. life just seems like a shitload of regrets for me. i don't want them to be of corse, but i am such a lousy decision maker and i hate it. i hate how no matter what i do is wrong. talking to people doesn't help, either. you'd think a month or so of nasty moods would be enough for one person to handle. but i guess not. i just want something to come along to make things all better. i want someone to come along most of all. cuz right now i have to purpsose or no aim or anything. after high school i want to go to college and mkae money. but thats all i know. not what college or where or what i want to do with my life. i know nothing and i don't think many people do right now, its part of beign a teenager, but i really hate it. and i right now, this second, i don't know if iw ant things to be like they were, ever. maybe i might be happier in ipswich with my dad. but i'll never know. do i regret making this move? maybe. it all happened so quickly and i was so influenced and i'm so not. anymore. i'm so incredibly confused. and along with that my friends are few and far between, i have no money, i have no job, and i have no car. it's just a self pity day. and i'm milking it for all its worth. and on top of that. i miss my cat. and i really wish people would stop treating me as if they don't care. maybe they really don't, but i really want them to. just a little bit. and it's so stupid of me to want that but i do. cuz the part i don't get is why they don't understand or care. cuz it really pisses me off when i'm in that situation. i wish i was one of those people whos issues just go over their head. i wish i could blow things off. maybe i'll just have to smoke more pot."

(what juli?)well i was thinking about holden. it's so weird not living there anymore. it's so weird to think i'll never see that house again. it was the house where i grew up. and i was thinking, isn't memory a funny thing? without it i'd be lost. cuz sometimes i can justs it adn think about things, things i remeber when i was little. and i miss that house. witht hat house was the family. it was so cozy, in the fall my dad would rake up the leaves and my brother and i would play in them. my mom would bake chiken soup in the winter, and it would snow so hard that we could pile up snow under the deck and jump off the roof into it. in the spring my dad let us runa round in the rain and it was the season when that funny yellow bush out front came into bloom. the summer was the best becasue of the pool. my mom would always try to get us to dip our feet in the water bucket before getting in the pool but we never did. and it seems like not long ago at all. but it's been four years. i remember that like i was eight again. it seems like when we moved away we kind of left everything there. we don't have a big christmas tree anymore. my mom hardly ever bakes and it never snows in ipswich. what i miss most of all was the fact all four of us could squish into one bed to watch sunday night disney movies. and i was happy. i was so happy."

i miss my daddy.
i miss my friends.

i miss living on the neck.
i miss having a seat at the lunch table every day.
i miss the summer.
i miss being able to tlk for hours with people, people who if i call up today probably won't even say more than a sentence to me.
i miss that warm place in that warm room with the feeling of home.
i miss being able to shy away from things that i didn't want to see.
i miss you, most of all.

my mom's boyfriend is trying to take me apple picking. i can't do it because whenever it think of apple picking it think of my dad. i almost feel like i'm betraying my dad by not telling him about jim. i almost feel guilty. it's so much easier to shield the ones you love, i guess. i mean telling him wouldn't benefit him any. and i know that one for sure.

Plus, last time I bought a pair and then realized they didn't fit, I sent them back and they sent me two packages! I really need to send stuff back more."

"event","The best deal around for travelling is renting books on CD or tape. Nothing makes the time go faster. But I'll be more careful before I go choosing a book again from Cracker Barrel. That's right! Those homogenized bastards that coat overpasses and offramps across America are hoarding some of the crappiest books EVER! Beware!
1) State of Fear -Michael Creighton
I'm now feeling like I need to do my own research on environmental issues. Good point Creighton... there may be bias and lies coming from enviro groups. But for craps sake don't write such a crappy book to get your point across! Maybe you don't like the show West Wing, Michael, but you don't have to invent a Martin Sheen character, then make him a Falstaff character of the truest and baudiest form. Of course, M.C. goes a step further and wreaks hellish death upon his foe by having him cannibalized. 
2) Black  -by someguy that if I knew his name I would write him mean emails
The clerk mentioned to me that this author is a Christian writer. Oh, how I shudder now at this grim forshadowing of my journey through this 12 cd epic crapwad. This author apparetly liked the bible so much, he wanted to take all the good images and stories and reflesh them in a modern supernatural-terrorism thriller. You know, that could be a good idea... if you follow through with some good story, character development, and ADVANCEMENT OF PLOT!! 
3) The Opal Deception: Artemis Fowl -by some British guy undoubtably
Well, this book isn't so bad. They chose a book in the series that is forced to reexplain everything for you first time Fowl readers. Artemis Fowl is a lot like Harry Potter, but with more balls. My biggest irk with Potter is the protaganist is stupid and never actually does anything on his own. Ever. Artemis is a genius that does nearly everything for himself and brilliantly. Why do authors insist on making overly stupid characters?
4) The Broker -John Grisham
Like all Grisham's... it's a good book. Chinese food is tasty. The Broker is like eating Chinese food."

"event","Tomorrow I drive down to Texas. Why do we habitually think of south as down and north as up... but never east nor west as a left or right?
Most importantly, let's discuss my feelings on owning a Honda Civic Hybrid '03. This little beauty is taking me on the trip again. Whenever I'm driving it's a constant struggle of, ""Is this a worthy buy?"" So here's how it is:
Over the past 10,000 miles I have an average of 42.7 mpg. I'm sure I could have found a car that could average around 32.7 mpg like a regular civic or a manual compact car. So I probably coughed up another $3,000 for a gain of 10 mpg. With the hybrid, I've probably used 234 gallons of gas. With a cheaper compact, that would be 306... saving me 72 gallons of gas. Since August, I would say the average gas price I've been paying has been 2.75 (I put in premium and was in Texas during the hurricanes... also known as Gas Gouging Season) so that would be $69.25 dollars in gas. Not a big savings to worry about. Damnit I wish gas was more expensive so that I could rub this in some faces. 
Regardless of that, I really wanted a hybrid deep in my heart. As I was car shopping, I spied a few Prius and Civic hybrid models for around $18000 used... and that's why I feel special to have found my darling for $14,000. It is pleasing to have an efficient car. I feel like a less guilty consumer. I am supporting a part of the industry and a company that put these kind of products out there for environmentally minded individuals. This very major purchase is my biggest use of consumer power yet. Well... shit I guess it's a used car so that doesn't send a message to Honda. Hopefully, the repurchasing of this car will also keep the model's value up, and likewise, strengthen the market for efficient cars. 
That's all good and fine when explaining such matters to myself... but some days I'm in it and getting only 39 mpg. Those cold, rainy days and windy drives sure make a dent on fuel economy. I find myself hugging the bumper of a semi for each precious mpg I can milk so that my expensive lovechild is justified. Also, many have raised the question of ""what happens when the battery needs to be changed?"" Well crap I hadn't thought of that. As I go piling miles into my car like a fat kid at the desert bar at Old Country Buffet... some dreaded maintenance is drawing closer. Oh blast! Oh cruel world! Should I sell during the next gas crisis and try to come out even? Should I ride this baby for all she's worth?
I just can't say.
She's pretty. She's smooth. She impresses my friends and has all the power I need. But if I get an offer for $18000 she may just have to leave me to a happier soul that's less worried about their every dollar."

"event","I have ended up on many computers of my nuclear family to keep tabs on my life as I nomadically roam. Most are underprotected from the spyware/adware out there. So, I compulsively feel the need to setup a solid defense. For my computer, I have Norton Internet Security '05 and CounterSpy. NIS '05, has disappointed me. It took me about 4 months and numerous reinstalls to get that program right. Norton provides a decent web based support system, but charges $$ for anything else (despite the $50+ you shell out). I think Norton must nose it's way into too many places in the system. I remember my first computer in 1998 had Norton Systemworks on it for a while until I found it didn't help at all. But after uninstalling it, there were unremovable traces that camped out in my system. 
NIS '05 works for me now. It appears all you have to do is reinstall it to extend your subscription. I'll see in a few months when it has actually been a year since my first time using it. 
And I'd like to discuss CounterSpy. I chose it because PCWorld ranked it the best antispyware software. I ran it alongside SpySweeper for a few weeks, and CounterSpy found one trace that SpySweeper didn't... so C.S. got my $20 for a subscription. 
All this has been on my mind because here I am visiting my mother and using her computer. She has SpyDoctor on it as a trial version. I gave it a run and it found 314 traces! But, it wouldn't do anything about these unless you paid for the real deal program. Something smelled like feces, so I tried CS. This turned up 4 traces and removed them (in free trial mode). So everyone, I'd like to introduce you to SpyDoctor. He's an asshole. And there's probably more out there like him."

"event","I've wondered why I've yet to take advantage of the ease of dissemination of my thoughts that the internet gives me. There are some I know that should be posting their thoughts. I may have some. Notably, complaints about life as a consumer. Hopefully, I can now keep the reading world posted whenever a product or advertisement pisses me off and thus deserves a severe online slandering. Or maybe, I like something."

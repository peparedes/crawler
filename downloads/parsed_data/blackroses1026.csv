I thought everything was fucking grand until we went for ice cream, when I realized how very very wrong I was.  It was an awfully awkward day.  Sara stayed for a week.

By Peter Carlson | The Washington Post 
Posted June 12, 2005 

GREENVILLE, S.C. -- Is Bob Jones University going to the devil? 

Could America's most famous bastion of hard-core Christian fundamentalism and pugnacious political conservatism be getting a little . . . soft? There are signs, portents. 

In 2000, Bob Jones III, president of the university and grandson of the founder, announced on Larry King Live that the school was ending its ban on interracial dating, long defended because ""God has separated people for his own purpose."" 

In 2003, the school ended the practice of ringing the dorm bells at 6:55 a.m. to rouse students for daily room inspections. 

In 2004, the university applied for and received accreditation, a process it always had avoided because, as Bob Jones III once said, ""accrediting associations will not approve our educational process if it does not include the worship of their gods."" 

And in May, for the first time in its 78-year history, Bob Jones University inaugurated a president not named Bob Jones. 

For eight decades, BJU has been led by three generations of Bob Joneses: preachers who pioneered a combative and highly political form of fundamentalism that gave rise to the ""Christian Right."" The Joneses became famous touting politicians they liked -- George Wallace, Barry Goldwater, George W. Bush -- while hurling thunderbolts of quotable vitriol at apostates, back-sliders and liberals. 

Bob Jones, the hellfire-and-brimstone evangelist who founded the nondenominational Protestant school in 1927, railed against the Catholic Church, which stands, he said, ""for ignorance and superstition and the slavery of the human soul."" 

Bob Jones Jr. pilloried Secretary of State Alexander Haig as ""a monster in human flesh"" and publicly prayed that God would ""smite him hip and thigh, bone and marrow, heart and lungs."" 

Bob Jones III denounced Ronald Reagan as ""a traitor to God's people"" for the sin of choosing as his vice president George H.W. Bush, whom Jones called ""a devil."" 

But at the May graduation ceremony, the presidency passed to Stephen B. Jones, 35, the founder's great-grandson, a mild-mannered fellow who describes himself as ""laid-back"" and says he doubts that he'll be calling on God to smite anyone. 

""I don't think so,"" he says, laughing. ""I will be praying for the opposition."" 

This raises the question: What next? Will Bob Jones University start permitting students to play rock-and-roll? Or hold hands? Or even, God forbid, kiss? 

""It's not that there's anything wrong with kissing,"" says Jonathan Pait, BJU's community-relations coordinator. ""It's not a sin. It's just that we have a different focus."" 

The rules are codified in the student handbook, but the rules forbid giving the handbook to outsiders. ""Outsiders don't understand the context of the rules,"" Pait explains. 

The context is BJU's mission, which is to give students a ""Christlike character."" Anything that interferes with that goal is forbidden. That includes smoking, drinking, dancing, gambling, TVs in dorm rooms, unrestricted Internet access and most modern music, including rock, rap, country, jazz -- even Christian music if it has a ""sensual"" beat. The rules also forbid coming to class in jeans, shorts or skirts that don't cover the knee. 

These rules are not controversial on campus, Pait says. More than 80 percent of the 4,800 students come from either Christian schools or were home-schooled, and they're used to strict rules. Also, many of the students are the offspring of BJU graduates. ""There are a lot of third-generation students,"" Pait says. 

The difference between Bob Jones and secular schools, Pait says, is that at BJU every teacher is a fundamentalist Christian and every subject is taught from a ""Christian worldview."" 

""In secular schools, they say, 'Let's use science to discover the unknown truth,' "" Pait says. ""We say, 'We know the truth -- how does this glorify the truth, who is God?' "" 

<b>'1 of the lucky girls'</b>
Next to the BJU bookstore is the BJU snack bar, famous for its delicious milkshakes. Brandy Ravan, 20, is sitting there, doing her homework. 

She's a sophomore from Spartanburg, S.C., working her way through school with a job in the campus dining halls. 

""I'm one of the lucky girls who get to do banquets,"" she says. ""I get to serve Stephen Jones and Dr. Bob."" 

She was born again in the ninth grade -- ""I'm the only one in my family who's saved,"" she says -- and she paid her way through a Christian high school by working at McDonald's. At that school, she learned about BJU. 

""I felt the Lord was saying, 'Go to Bob Jones,' "" she says. 

She's studying child care, hoping to teach in a Christian school. She loves BJU. 

""Everyone is very loving,"" she says. ""They want us to serve the Lord and that's great. I know there are people who aren't serving the Lord, like Catholics. I want to serve the Lord by witnessing to them."" 

BJU's many rules make sense to her, such as the ones against hand-holding. 

""One thing leads to another,"" she says. ""Girls like to touch. First it's your pinkies and then your hand and then kissing. It's dangerous.""

<b>Keeping it in the family</b>
""We are what we are -- and what we've always been,"" says Bob Jones III. ""So much of academia has turned another way and we're an island in an alien world, a secular world."" 

At 65, Dr. Bob is a thin man with a warm smile and a friendly manner -- except when he's denouncing the sins of his godless nation. 

""Homosexuality is a sin -- cut and dried, no question about it,"" he says. ""It's as plain as the nose on your face in the Bible."" 

Dr. Bob defends the Jones tradition of vitriolic political rhetoric. ""I don't believe the defense of the truth should be milquetoast,"" he says. ""Sometimes you have to be bold and say straightforward things."" 

Will Stephen Jones, his son and successor, be as bold and straightforward? 

""He's not weak,"" Dr. Bob says. ""When the Bible is under attack or Christians are being misrepresented, he's going to stand up. He may do it more graciously than I did -- and I hope he would -- but he's not without conviction."" 

Stephen Jones never wanted to be president of Bob Jones University. 

""I knew the pressures Dad was under -- the travel and preaching and being away from the family and the national spotlight that so often comes in our direction,"" he says. ""And I looked at that and said, 'You'd have to be insane to want that!' "" 

Growing up, he didn't expect to become president of BJU. His older brother, Bob Jones IV, was being groomed for that job. 

Bob IV got a master's degree in nonprofit corporation management from George Washington University in 1992, but in the late '90s, he told his father that the Lord was calling him to be a writer, not a college president. So the burden fell to Stephen.

""I surrendered and said, 'OK, if this is what the Lord wants, I'm willing to do it,' "" he says.

Josh ended up staying the night because we got home from the movies around ten and there was a frightful storm about to land... and my dad was a bit ""out of his element,"" so to speak.  We sat on the front porch for the majority of the storm, and it was beautiful.  Torrents of rain, lightning striking near the park.  (Hah, as soon as I started typing about rain, it started to pour.)  I love this kind of weather.  After the storm, we watched 28 Days Later in my living room, and I fell asleep with him on the couch, then went to bed once it was over.  (It's storming so beautifully again.)  This morning I woke up early.  
My dad walked in a few minutes ago to make sure I was still in my bed and not participating in any questionable activities, namely, on the couch downstairs.  He didn't see me at the computer, and when he saw my bed empty he stood up very very straight and freaked out a little.  
I have to babysit in an hour.  Not sure how today will play out.  

Hmm...

Wonderful day with Joshua.

Plans have fallen through:
No job with Georgia's father.
Application time!

EDIT:  
I forgot the rest of the day, and the fact that it was the last day of my sophomore year.
It's weird; I've looked forward to tenth grade since I was a little girl, and now that it's over ...all of that glorification was completely unfounded.  I've grown so much this year.  Up and apart, I guess you could say.  Closer to some, but not many.  I'm (generally) happy now, and I'm not sure if it's any better than the opposite.  I have desires, plans, goals, opinions, a <u>personality.</u>  More mature.  Less wild.
So I guess this year wasn't so bad.  
Today I went out for breakfast with newspaper, which served as my first exam.  Nothing remarkable, but it was cheap and I'm certainly appreciative of that.  I went back to school to see all of my Euro pals one last time.  We tried to play Risk but decided that it was too complicated, and then began a very boring game of Monopoly, which we quit after a few minutes.  That was such a great class.  After school ended, Sean and Paul and I visited Ms. Hilley, who I am SO going to see during summer school.  
My mom and I picked up Josh from the Fed Ex building and he got to meet Mr. Groover!  I love that man!  EDIT # 2:  Josh and I went to the library and discovered that it's the hippest place in town, so we checked out David and Lisa and watched it at Sam's house with Sam and Pete.  Sam and Pete made me laugh.  The couch was quite comfortable.  The movie was quite enjoyable.  Josh and I had a wonderful day, watched the sunset over a lake.  Utterly beautiful.  Subjects and verbs are so passe.  Adjective phrases are where it's at.  
Yay life. 
Yay Russians.
Yay nihilists.

This summer holds so much potential."

This weekend was terrific.  I spent heaps of time with my two favorite people, and at times we were all TOGETHER!  I am completely content, want of nothing.  
This is all a bit difficult though, because I feel as though I belong up there.  For right now at least.  Sara and I spoke about this.  The dynamics of <i>everything</i> are different there.  Personalities are different, rules are different, hell, even the neighborhood are different.  And I don't like it for the simple contrast of environment, I like it for what it is.  
God, I'm so moving.  
Then moving again.  
And then several times a year, for the rest of my life, until I decide to marry and possibly raise children.  
Enormous ""possibly"" right there.
And then I'll move once more to the paradise with the lions who sleep on black beaches.
Oh, we will.

I am currently working on two different letters, one of which is an assignment, the other an actual letter.
So many things have me feeling inspired lately, i.e. Ireland, the documentary called <i>Anna</i> that we're watching in Euro, certain people.  
I bared my proverbial soul to Kristen in French today.  Jesus, I tell her <b>everything</b>.  Thank you, Kristen.
Cell phones came in the mail today.  The sharing-three-phones-between-five-people plan won't last for very long.
I've no idea how this weekend will work out, but there's a boy--his name has escaped me at the moment, but he's positively ""hip to the jive""--having a birthday soon, and I'm going to see him.

<lj-cut text=""Poem#2"">

at their best, there is gentleness in Humanity.
some understanding and, at times, acts of
courage
but all in all it is a mass, a glob that doesn't
have too much.
it is like a large animal deep in sleep and
almost nothing can awaken it.
when activated it's best at brutality,
selfishness, unjust judgments, murder. 

what can we do with it, this Humanity? 

nothing. 

avoid the thing as much as possible.
treat it as you would anything poisonous, vicious
and mindless.
but be careful. it has enacted laws to protect
itself from you.
it can kill you without cause.
and to escape it you must be subtle.
few escape. 

it's up to you to figure a plan. 

I have met nobody who has escaped. 

I have met some of the great and
famous but they have not escaped
for they are only great and famous within
Humanity. 

I have not escaped
but I have not failed in trying again and
again. 

before my death I hope to obtain my
life. 
--Bukowski

<lj-cut text=""Poem#1"">
Humanity i love you 
because you would rather black the boots of 
success than enquire whose soul dangles from his 
watch-chain which would be embarrassing for both 

parties and because you 
unflinchingly applaud all 
songs containing the words country home and 
mother when sung at the old howard 

Humanity i love you because 
when you're hard up you pawn your 
intelligence to buy a drink and when 
you're flush pride keeps 

you from the pawn shops and 
because you are continually committing 
nuisances but more 
especially in your own house 

Humanity i love you because you 
are perpetually putting the secret of 
life in your pants and forgetting 
it's there and sitting down 

on it 
and because you are 
forever making poems in the lap 
of death Humanity 

i hate you

Jessica was raped, buried alive
The 9-year-old girl died kneeling and clutching a stuffed animal, prosecutors say.

The Associated Press 
Posted April 21, 2005 


HOMOSASSA -- Jessica Lunsford was raped, bound and buried alive, kneeling and clutching a purple stuffed dolphin, state prosecutors said in documents released Wednesday.

The 9-year-old girl's body was found March 19, buried about 150 yards from her house in Homosassa.

According to 292 pages of evidence, Jessica was found wearing shorts and a shirt -- different from the pink nightgown her family said she was wearing when they reported her missing Feb. 24.

The body was wrapped in two plastic trash bags knotted at her head and feet in a grave covered by a mound of leaves, the State Attorney's Office said in the statements.

Jessica died of asphyxiation, according to a coroner's report.

A convicted sex offender, John Evander Couey, 46, is charged in her slaying. He has pleaded not guilty. A message left by The Associated Press for Couey's attorney, Dan Lewan, was not returned Wednesday.

Prosecutors have said Couey entered Jessica's house through an unlocked door and abducted the girl from her bed while her grandparents were asleep in another part of the house.

Officials said they think Jessica may have been alive in a nearby mobile home where Couey was staying while police and volunteers searched for her. The search included doorstep interviews with people living at the home.

After she was killed, Couey fled to Georgia, where officials tracked him down.

Couey reportedly confessed to abducting and killing the Citrus County third-grader after taking a lie-detector test. He said she was alive when he put her in the trash bags and buried her, the transcripts said.

""The victim appeared to be enclosed in a black garbage bag in a sitting position, with her knees pulled up to her chest and her arms between them,"" sheriff's Detective Brian Spiddle wrote in a narrative included in the documents.

Couey told investigators where to find the grave.

Detective David Strickland wrote that Jessica's hands appeared to be bound in front of her with speaker wire. Strickland also wrote that a medical examiner noted signs of sexual battery.

Couey has a home elsewhere in Homosassa, but sometimes stayed with a half-sister in her mobile home, where Jessica's body was found, authorities said. The town is about 60 miles north of Tampa.

Couey said his half-sister and two others living in the mobile home did not know he had kidnapped the girl and kept her there, prosecutors said.

Articles of clothing taken from Couey's bedroom appeared to have blood on them, and a mattress and bedding had similar stains, though there was no evidence Jessica had been in that room, according to the statements.

Couey's criminal record includes 24 arrests for burglary, carrying a concealed weapon, indecent exposure and other offenses. In 1991, he was arrested in Kissimmee on a charge of fondling a child under 16. Records don't show how the case was resolved.

I wish I had something profound to say.
GlobalFest at Lake Como was enjoyable, mostly due to Ali, our new Kenyan friend who was hosting the Islamic booth.  He was refreshingly informative and friendly.  I'd probably convert if it didn't involve recognizing one god and submitting to his will.  The burkas are just so cool...
I definitely reconnected with my childhood, what with Fern Gully and all. 
The Amityville Horror was a typical horror flick.  Nothing too impressive, but worth the 6.50.  There are only a few good things about WPV, and the elevator and moveable armrests are definitely among them.
I'm sort of sad, melancholy.  Mom says I've been a bit arrogant lately.  And I managed to make everyone feel like shit to the point of leaving the room when I was doing my homework, so maybe she's onto something?  It feels like it.  But come on, I'm not going to lower my standards due to someone else's incompetence.  I'm so fucking critical lately and I don't like it.
F it all.  I've got a great life.

Newspaper restaurant review tonight.  
Georgia got in trouble for dress code violation and her mother is expectedly freaking out.
And then after school Joey and I had a talk, which was interesting as I haven't spoken with any of the people from last year, since, well, last year.  
And then I explained my stance on morals to Cruz, who is quite possibly the most sexual gay boy, ever.  Oh, but he's so adorable.  He and Nicole (who is a lesbian) were kissing after school and everyone was so shocked, which is of course what they were going for.  I love how he's still operating under the impression that Georgia and I are sisters, which I realized is actually believeable.  
I absolutely adore Carol because she's beautiful both nside and out.

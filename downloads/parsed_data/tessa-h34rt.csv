"event","<p>I took yet another quiz (me n mah quiz eh hehe) from High School Musical webbie at Disney. here's what i got ^_^<br /><br />You're most like GABRIELLA!</p>
<p>Did a star in the sky ever shine so bright? Charming, sophisticated and beyond intelligent, you could not be more balanced, just like GABRIELLA. Others are jelous of how together you are. Being such a fantastic observer, you assess all situations and never make your move too soon. Right time, right place -- you always know. You're open to all people and all different walks of like. To you, nobody fits in a single category. However, you have a tendency not to believe in yourself as much as you should. You're WONDERFUL! Go with it and there are no limits to what you can achieve for yourself and the world you live in!<br />**14% of the people that took this quiz got the same score as you**<br /><br />yeay! im the sweet one!! lol. the shy but wants to shine lol. okok...bye</p>"

"event","<p align=""left"">Call me a sucker, but right now, i am uberly into High School Musical from Disney! why??? because:<br />a) the mains can sing<br />b) the mains are hot!<br />c) the mains can move!<br />d) i smile and feel so much more better when i watch it!<br /><br /><img alt=""Troy and Gabriella R'ship!"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v297/koneko_kae/Celebs/TroynGabriellasmall.jpg"" /><br /><br />High School Musical.<br />Basically, its a story of how two people from the oposite ends of the social ladder meet on one fine Karaoke New Year Night where their status is still remained silent. Troy Bolton (played by Zac Efron) is the captain of the East High Wildcats Basketball team. He's mind is only on the game...that is until Gabriella (played by Vanessa Anne Hudgeson - remember TinTin from ThunderBirds?), a 'freaky math girl' as she dubbs herself, is transfered to East High. She's determined to start fresh in everyone's point-of-view, but things always don't go as planned. Gabriella unleashed the 'performer' in Troy, making him feel that there is more to living than just Basketball. However, both of their socially seperated friends are determined to see to it that Basketball jocks stay as jocks; Geeks stay as geeks. Their inner feelings are of course expressed in a Broadway Musical style, along with hip-hop moves. totally awesome choreography!<br /><br /><br />i categorized them under ""Feel Good"" movie. This kind of movie has the ability to lighten up your mood instantly and make you believe in the impossible! True, i'm about to turn 20 soon, but my interest goes beyond the stereotypical age line.&nbsp;<br /><br />I recommend High School Musical to everyone who isn't stereotypical.<br /><br />Among the few uberly sing-able song i'm tuning my toot-horn is <strong><u><font size=""4"">Start of Something New</font></u></strong> performed by both of the stars...<br /><br />[Troy:]<br />Living in my own world <br />Didn't understand <br />That anything can happen <br />When you take a chance <br /><br />[Gabriella:]<br />I never believed in<br />What I couldn't see <br />I never opened my heart (oh)<br />To all the possibilities (oh) <br /><br />[Both:] <br />I know<br /><br />[Gabriella:] <br />That something has changed<br /><br />[Both:] <br />Never felt this way<br /><br />[Gabriella:] <br />And right here tonight<br /><br />This could be the start <br />Of something new <br />It feels so right <br /><br />[Both:]<br />To be here with you (oh)<br />And now looking in your eyes <br /><br />[Gabriella:]<br />I feel in my heart <br /><br />[Troy]: Feel in my heart<br /><br />[Both:]<br />The start of something new <br /><br />[Troy:]<br />Oh, yeah,<br />Now who'd of ever thought that <br /><br />[Both:]<br />We'd both be here tonight (oh)<br /><br />[Gabriella (Troy):]<br />Yeah, and the world looks so much brighter (brighter, brighter)<br /><br />[Both:]<br />Oh, with you by my side <br /><br />I know that something has changed <br />Never felt this way <br /><br />[Gabriella:]<br />I know it for real <br /><br />[Both:]<br />This could be the start <br />Of something new <br />It feels so right <br />To be here with you (oh)<br />And now looking in your eyes <br />I feel in my heart (feel it in my heart)<br /><br />[Gabriella:]<br />The start of something new <br /><br />[Troy:]<br />I never knew that it could happen <br />Till it happened to me (whoaaaooh yeah)<br /><br />[Both:] <br />I didn't know it before<br /><br />[Gabriella] <br />But now it's easy to<br /><br />[Both] <br />See (Ohh)<br /><br />[Both:] <br />It's the start of something new <br />It feels so right <br />To be here with you (oh)<br /><br />[Both:] <br />And now looking in your eyes (looking in your eyes)<br />I feel in my heart (feel in my heart)<br /><br />That it's the start <br />Of something new <br />It feels so right <br /><br />[Gabriella:]<br />To be here with you (oh)<br /><br />[Both:]<br />And now looking in your eyes (looking in your eyes)<br /><br />[Gabriella (Troy):]<br />I feel in my heart (feel in my heart)<br /><br />[Gabriela:] <br />The start of something new<br /><br />[Troy:]<br />The start of something new <br /><br />[Both:]<br />Start of something new</p>"

AWESOME! well, its very entertaining in my opinion. not exactly an awardwinning movie, but a Blockbuster none the less.

i love a movie with a wicked sense of humor, touching moment, with dashes of unexpected moments. 

X-men didn't disappoint on that part thats for sure ^_^

i watched X-Men 3 with Lye shean cause everyone else cancelled on me T_T

"event","I've updated my Movie Listings by cancelling out what i've already watched ^^ me ish happie!! Da Vinci was gooooood ^^ made me wish i was in France damn it! in truth i have not read the book and i refused to cause of the title. i have no objection to Da Vinci..its just i feared it would require high end thinking and all...this is where ""Dont judge a book by its cover"" comes to mind..ish. eat my own words...

anyways, the movie was good. i felt like i was on the adventure with the characters like Professor Landon and Nuvou...and the backdrop of France just tingled me..i mean im like so into French again thanks to my current project and well...to hear Nuvou speak in french and her english slang just made me grin!! and and i saw my car!!! My Citroen Xsara!! woo hoo!! except it was in maroon...and no aeroback...but all and all, it was great movie! so great i want to read the book!! and i have it! haha! the cool part is the ""suppose to be"" censorred parts...the camera angle and film direction was soooo good that they managed to make nude scenes possible on the floors of Malaysia!! true!! 

Next up is X-men 3 on the 24 may. i've finally got tickets!! well, two actually. two sets i mean. at 11:45pm at Mid V. a set of four. me and lye promised to watch together (Which reminds me..i have to watch it with Faris on another day as well ;-P ) but i thought mandy would wanna come as well. and with mandy, comes her physically detached and yet unbreakable other half. so all together, 4 tickets...hopefully...we get goood seats like DA Vinci huhuhu... ^^"

i only discovered its existance while watching Fraiser hours ago. i wondered what it was at first. i heard everyone in there say, ""Kidney Lime Pie"" so i was like ""......er....okay...thats...high class...""

then, i read the promter in malay spelling, ""Key Lime Pie"" so okay...i trust them in Astro..in movies..not so much haha. i wondered what it looked like...then Martin opened the aluminium foil above it revealing a cheese cake looking pie...they forked it and..it looked so soft...and so...weirdly mouth watering!!! so instantly i searched online for the recipe...needless to say...I SO WANT TO MAKE THIS!!! who is willing to contribute cash?? :-P im willing to make it all for you, as long as you let me have two slices >_< u can have the rest...waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...it looks so simple...and yet...ergh! i still want to make it!! the ergh to bake...waaa..although minimal baking required...

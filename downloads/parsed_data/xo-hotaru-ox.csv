"event","Ah, Ashleighs back (with my shoe. lirl). Lauren never did call. I guess she's forgotten about me. No matter there. Everyone forgets about me. -sighs- I was there, then I wasn't. Its not like she couldn't replace me. And as these little things are resolved in my mind and I focus on myself more and more I get more and more distant from those I love. u_u I don't know why but my parents are flipping and my friends are worried? Psh. I see no proof of that. I'm so dense. Trevor, you want to know why I don't have a boyfriend? Its because I'm not worthy. 
OF ANYTHING. You want to know why I don't cry when he, or anyone tells me they hate me?
Cause it has no heart to reach. I'm nothing. A mere shadow. I'm a dense, lying, ugly, person who has nothing but a few friends left. u_u"

"event","Okay, listen up. Many people on this site are democrat. Most of them can't even VOTE so you know what? They should all just shut the poop up. Bush is not a bad person. The media, whom is the only source for quick easy information and the school system teachers are highly liberal. It's kinda obvious. The media alters all good things into bad things. They tell us what we want to hear. If you want to hear something about how Bush sucks, then turn on your TV and sit down. That's all there is to it. Bush is bringing troops home in July. He's taken care of many of the threats we faced as a nation. BUT of course the Media will not tell you that. Nor will it tell you the following:

After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six and injured 1000; President Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.
BUSH COVERED IT!

After the 1995 bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed five U.S. military personnel; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.
BUSH COVERED IT!

After the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 and injured 200 U.S. military personnel; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.
BUSH COVERED IT!

After the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa, which killed 224 and injured 5,000; Clinton promised that those responsible! would be hunted down and punished.
BUSH COVERED IT!

After the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 and injured 39 U.S. sailors; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.
BUSH COVERED IT!

Maybe if Clinton had kept his promise, an estimated 3,000 people in New York and Washington, D.C. that are now dead would be alive today.

And, now that Bush is taking action to bring these people to justice, we have Democrats charging him with being a war monger...


ANOTHER THING

I am fed up with Liberals constantly in my face pleading their cases. NOT 1 Liberal that I have come across has any respect for anybody elses point of view or beliefs, yet they pride themselves on being tolerant to others. They don't understand what debating is. They prefer to argue and in some cases take it to a whole new level with personal insults. I do not seek these people out. They find me. I do NOT deliver an invitation to hear their regurgitated reasons for hating President Bush, or why they chose to become a Democrat, because I really don't give a $h1+ what they think and feel. If I had a penny for everytime I heard these people call Republicans ""Hitler"", I'd be shacking up in Bill Gates' neighborhood!"

No matter how many letters, visits, and phone calls, they won't be able to replace what SHOULD'VE happened. Am I being selfish? 'Will you remember me? Cause I know I won't forget you.' I guess thats true. I'm afraid she'll forget me. And lets not even start on everyone else. All my 8th grade friends are going to high school, my friends are moving, making new friends. I'm just drifting away and I know they could care less. It's getting harder and harder to get through the day. I'm surving and I won't do anything rash, but I just feel like crying. Just crawling under my bed and sobbing. No school. No stress. No worries. Just cries. Yeah, well, I'm going to be going. I'll make a quick update later.

Because I didn't say thank you or anything and again today because we went to the mall and bought Codee stuff for her birthday because she didn't like what my mom had gotten her (--;) And she didn't say thank you. x_x I have got to admit, I'm a bit mad at Codee. She got to go into EVERY shop she wanted to (Wet Seal, The Body Shop, Dillards, JC Pennys, Limited 2, etc. etc.) and I had to wait for her to try and clothes and blah blah blah, but when I went into a store (FYE and Pacsun) We had to leave 5 minuted into looking. FYE she was done shopping and I wasn't and she walked in there all: Come on, lets go! Because SHE was done shopping. In my opinion, How conceited. >_< Grr to you. I'm not ungreatful...or greedy, am I? =/ It just kind of made me mad.

Patty dared Chastity and I to go into the mens bathroom and when we went in there Chastity goes: Are there any sexthy men in here? And some man came out and looked at us, we're all: -FLEE- He was following us around so we got scared and went to the movie. LoL! Scooby Doo 2 rocks! :DDD We were rolling down the hill and stuff and screaming and wrestling and stuff. ^-^ Good times, goooood times! ~^ As Liz would say! Har Har. They spent the night and all, then on Saturday we got bored and went to the mall. (Without money I might add) And I ended up spending the night at Patty's. THEY WERE GREEN PATTY! We watched a Brittney Spears concert. XD And Patty kept giving me a wedgie so when I went to bed I was all curled around Chastity. XDDD It was funny, we got up shes like, ""Man...you are so weird to sleep with."" XD We went out to breakfast, blah blah blah, went skateboarding, fun stuff! :D I have a sun burn though. >> Owie. Patty is stalking Garret, we went to his house and she knows what window is his, thanks to Trevor. XDDDD Nice move Trevor! We know shes a stalker! ~^ But its okay, we love her anywho! :DD Chastity and Trevor were holding hands and I go, ""Be careful! You don't know where thats been!"" so she was chasing me and wiping her hand on me. XDD Trevor was all: Aww, thats insulting. :DDD Then we walked to WinnDixie to get a soda and candy. yummay... :DDD Then I went home and blah. I went to school. x.x How dull. Today, 8 fights before 5th period. Wooooah! :DD Lauren and Kristy might fight. I don't really want them too...x.x Its a shame, their both my friends. I have a dress rehersal tommrow for ""Blanca Flor"" Some play in Language Arts. We made it into ""Da Blanca Flor Hood"". Where we are all little gangsters.

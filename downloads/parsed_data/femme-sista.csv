"event","I am a 16 year old woman. Normal in every way. I follow the fads, I cry when I'm hit, I love my dog, I hate cleaning. But I have had my fair share of aspirations: ice dancer like Oksana Baul, teacher like Mrs. Potter, writer like Michelle Tea, Musician like Janis Joplin, or nurse like my cousin Jaime. I'm normal like everyone else, I've gone through my own trials and tribulations. Father deceased at age 3. Aunt deceased at age 11. Grandpa deceased at age 15. Sister deceased at age 16. Good family friend deceased at age 16. 

But nothing could've ever prepared me.

I'm a 16 year old woman. I will be moving out of my house in the next month, struggling to find a place to live in the next 2 weeks, and I will go through countless courthouse dates with CPS for the rest of my life.

I'm a 16 year old woman. I have a tattoo of my sisters name, my zodiac symbol, and I am about to add another 2 names to my body.

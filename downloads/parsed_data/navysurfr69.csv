"event","""Youre hiding something cause 
its burning through your eyes,
I try to get out 
but all I hear from you are lies,

And I can tell youre going 
thorugh the motions,
I figured you were 
acting out your part
once again we're 
playing on enotion
which one of us 
will burn until the end

Catalyst, you insist to pull me down,
you contradict the fact that 
you still want me around
And its all downhill from here.

your good intentions
slowly turn to bitterness
reoccuring episodes
with each and every kiss
And i can tell youre
going through the motions

and i cant believe 
you pulled it off again

youll deny it till 
youre at your bitter end

"event","just got back from work today, i had to moe grass and when i was finished i was covered in dust so thick, my pants were a light gray shade. yeah and then we had to mop the entire back room, b/c......(btw, i work for a veteranery(sp) clinic, and there is always a dog of cat there, so it smells like shit) anyway, we had to mop the back b/c this drain cleaning company had to shoot high pressure water up the drain b/c it was draining slow, and it backed up and didnt drain, and like month old shit and piss was everywhere, and it was black, and gross -gags- and we had to clean it all up.....disgusting.

anyway that was the highlight of my day

i really like being back friends w/ courtney (we...well i...recently broke up w/ her, very stupid reasons, and i miss her like crazy all the time, and the past few days, (or maybe a week), idk, we have been getting along and it great b/c i dont want to lose the once-and-still-is love of my life. so yeah im glad things are straight, and we are cool w/ eachother.

well that about wraps it up, ill post again soon

peace out"

The library isn't too bad today, although it's really busy for a Sunday and people keep complaining about stupid things or expect us to find all the book codes for them.  Here's to another seven days of constant work!"

In the meantime I've found a new job working in a lawyer's office as a general assistant/ typist/ telephonist/ dogsbody!! although I am being trained in conveyancing so hopefully that will go well. It's all good experience though.  I'm learning so much.  Also rejoined the gym so feeling much healthier of late.  

Have a quick question that I'll put to you all.  Been thinking of applying for a postgraduate course.  What do you think I should do Publishing or Librarianship?   

Hope you're all well and I see you soon!"

"event","I'm tired of uni work.  My Theatre Studies tutor has given us a week to write a report on last Thursday's performance(which surprizingly went rather well).  The report is to be 2,500 and presented as an academic essay with at least five background reading sources. I've managed to write it in three days, virtually unheard of for me. Its rubbish though but I have limited time available to me. Now I just have to panic about Scottish Literature, which is definitely on this Monday.  I know there's no point dwelling on it but if the exam hadn't been moved forward I would have two weeks from today to study for it, instead of a measly four days.  There goes any hope of getting a good degree, I don't know why I've had such earlier deadlines this year.  Anyone got any good excuses for phoning into work sick with!   

All be over with soon I suppose, cherish the thought of life without studying..."

And to think all would be fine if Scot Lit hadn't moved their exam 11 days forward.  I could cry.  I don't know what to do.  I have so much to do and so little time to do it in. I can feel that great degree mark slipping away from me and everyone laughing and calling me thick when I get a shitty mark. I haven't done anything today, thanks to worry, the fear of failure, and the fact that I'm physical shaking.  I wish I was naturally brainy like so many people I know, but I'm not and have to put the hours in.  Hours I don't have."

"event","I really should have went to uni today, but... Ended up getting a lot done at home and sometimes thats the best thing, one of those greater good moments when you realize I may not have been to class, but got 800 words of an essay written.  I had a nice time being at home today.  I studied in my pyjamas, which is a guilty pleasure I all too readily indulge in.  Who needs proper clother anyway?  I also got to indulge in another guilty pass time, watching Loose Women.  Complete tripe, but fabulous, a lot like the way I feel about Footballers' Wives.  

Had a quiet weekend.  It was my cousin's 30th birthday, so my aunt had a party in her house for him on Saturday night.  It was good fun, but I arrived home at 12.30am, sober and disorientated.  My body was at home, but my mind was in a club pretending to be a sugababe.  I still feel slightly disorientated.  I'm at home again tomorrow, which is good.  I'm so glad there's no Theatre Studies meeting tomorrow.  Brushing hair and putting on makeup can become really boring.  I may need to go out for a walk though.  I'm sure being cooped up in my room all day is not good, and I still haven't handed out my quota of birthday gifts.  

Right now though I'm hungry and need to eat.

Thanks to Drutt and Laura0141 for their kind comments the other day.  They really meant a lot to me.  Had my journalism presentation today.  It went okay except I was a bit nervous and I didn't have any visual aids.  Also the class ended up talking about Jade Goody's columns for about 10 minutes even though I didn't mention it once.  However they didn't laugh at my theory of Bridget Jones Diary being an intellectual column which was nice.  The new laptop which my dad bought is absolutely useless.  I'm going to insist he sends it back and instead of buying from Dell again, we go into a shop and purchase one complete with instructions since bugger all came with that one.  I don't think we should pay for something which crashes the second time you use it and cannot open its own instructions or word package.  I am cursed as far as technology goes, just like Hurley in Lost with his numbers.  Been a bit of a strange week.  I'll be glad when this week is over.

I tend to get over-emotional though at times so I'm not too concerned.  Laura B is back at Stirling now,  and is settling into her new flat well.  She has informed me though that I'm going out with her and Margaret on Saturday.  Laura is fab, she's almost as frivolous as me!  

Back to the homecoming though,  I had cleaned the house to such pristine standards that I was horrified when my dad dumped his suitcase on the living room floor and proceeded to light up a fag.  Today went bizarrely well.  I got up early, sat and had brekkie whilst watching Natasha Kaplinsky and co., and was early for work!  My mum also made me a lovely salad for dinner and I'm still full.  Also Beryl agreed to give me a reference which was very kind of her.  I'm kind of sad about leaving the library.  I'm living in a sort of bubble at the moment, which is nice, but I know its time to move on and go back to Uni and resume my academic life.  I'm looking forward to it and am slightly apprehensive, bizarre considering I know lots of people.

Whereas the staff in Cambuslang are older and more the traditional sort, Rutherglen was full of glamness - the children's assistant beared more than a passing resemblance to Catherine Zeta Jones.  It was all very strange.  I think I was only sent down there so Jean and Jemima could gossip all night as sending Jem would have been far more sensible, but I couldn't possibly comment, I am only the student after all.

Stayed up to about 3am watching Sex and the City DVS.  Of course I did that thing that all girls do and thought, mmm I wonder which one of the gals am I... and came to conclusion that alas I am indeed Stanford.  Last night I met up with LJ and Lauren.  Don't know where Lynne was.  Fear she may have been abducted by aliens!!!  Was very sad as they're both going away for a year come September.  Felt really guilty as I prob could have been a better friend, and now they're leaving.  I think I may need to change my behaviour actually.  At times I feel myself becoming a bit of a shit, which is odd cause I know deep down I'm ok really.  Not perfect, but its normal to have a slight amount of bitchiness in your blood.  It's what makes the world go around.  Was working at Halfway library today.  Lots of children running about, and someone almost broke the photocopier.  Gasp!  Mind you there was a full sized fan placed on top of the photocopier so it obviously can't be that important to them.  Unlike in Cambuslang with Beryl.  She would never tolerate such abomnable behaviour.

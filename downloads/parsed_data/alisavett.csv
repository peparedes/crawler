"event","What is this world coming to? Bush leading 4 more years.I can not believe young America.Now I totally can believe senior citizen for their votes,but come on youth.This guy is so close-minded.All he believes in is getting more money for the rich,charging the poor,raising taxes,and killing Iraqis.Bush can never answer a question.He beats around every question he gets.He always changes the subject.He stumbles over every line.He blatantly attacked everything John Kerry said in the debates.George Bush is a liar and a deceiver,and I hope all that voted for him are waiting the downfall our country is about to face.May God bless America..

She is such a child..I really don't need that type of person in my life right now..I really immature people..I really hope she wakes up one day and smells the coffee..That childish like behavior is a bit rediculous...I am so over it..I watched a couple of movies today..I watched 28 Days Later and The Matrix Reloaded...Both very excellent movies...I want to watch Minority Report..I love that fucking movie..It Rocks!!I also want to see Troy and Van Helsing..I will probably see them when i get to Paris..Anyways I don't have much to say right now so maybe I will write later..

"event","I can't believe Kate Beckinsale got married...I absolutely love her!!I am so happy that she found happines but I guess a small part of me wanted her to meet me and be like Alisavett you are the most beautiful woman in the world;Come with me and let's be together..I guess it was just all in my head though..Even my other Kate got married(Kate Moss)..I had the biggest crush on Kate Moss for like years..She is just so fucking beautiful..Anyways,in about 9 days I will be off to Paris.It's going to be work,work,work..But it will be alright.I will be able to chill after each day of work is done.I ahve friends in Paris so we can just chill out and light up..Can't wait.I really hate being a model sometimes.Yeah the money is great and the work, but its so hard to meet genuine people..Most people are just out to impress you so they can get in and use you..I hate that.Fake ass people around you constantly.It sucks..But the travelling is good and the free perks..The money is fucking amazing.That's probably the reason i still do it.I love travelling and buying great things so...Anyways,I really need to go..I will update later...

"event","Right now my love life is so fucking diffucult right now..I have my ex girlfriend who really wants to be with me.I really care about her but she is so obsessively jealous..Sometimes it's so hard to deal with.I really want to tell her sometimes to just Fuck Off!!! It's just not that easy..There is history there.Deep emotions..She asked me to marry her..I was so stunned..I didn't say yes but I didn't say no..I don't know what to do..I am so confused..She fights with people I care about.She gets jealous so easily..I guess it is partly my fault.I cheated on her in the past so she probably feels insecure now.Sometimes she gets things mixed up...She swears someone wants me..She is really jealous of this girl Christina.Christina is just a friend.Well I know Christina wants me but the point is I don't hit on her.She is fucking gorgeous though..I REALLY NEED ADVICE..

"event","I need to call Britney.I was thinking about her alot today..I wonder how her tour is going? The last time I called her I got the answering machine.I love her new video ""Everytime"".It's a bit wierd.I really want to know what made her do something like that.There has to be some life experience that made her come up with that video concept.I hear she has a new man.A guy who looks just like Justin.I definately need to catch up with her.I hope I get to see her once the tour is over.Enough about Brit.Hi Kerri.Just giving you a shout out if you are reading this.It's Friday night and I have nothing better to do then be on the computer.You would think that a model could find something to do.I am just not into partying anymore and thats what most of my friends are into.It gets so boring after awhile.Seeing the same people,having to pose and front for them.I need new friends.Or there must be something wrong with me.These people for some reason are drawn to me.There must be something wrong with me.I don't see what it could be.I am such a sweet and loyal person.I get along with everyone.Anyways maybe I will find something to do tommorrow.I miss Erica.I wonder what she is up to."

"event","Well I got back from my trip to Philly about a week ago.I really needed to get away even though when I was in Philly I didn't do much.I basically just chilled out at my friend's place and played video games.I went out to a couple of bars and clubs but other than that I just hung around.I went out to the Poconos.My friend just bought a house there so we went to check it out.It's awesome.I can't wait to leave for Paris this month(May).Can't wait.It's going to be mostly work but who can complain?I love taking breaks from work...Who doesn't??But my vacations sometimes are really off the hook..I am sitting here typing and watching t.v..Earlier there was this thing on about Prince.I absolutely adore him.He is an incredible artist.He is so original.He plays all his own instruments,writes songs,produces.He's the man.Anyways we performed live.He has a new album.It's called Musicology.I definately have to get it..I recently purchased Nora Jones's album..I am in love.Her writing and piano playing is so beautiful.She has this song called ""Come away with me"".Oh my god!!There is something so sexy about her.I also like Michelle Branch.I really want to sleep..I don't sleep enough.I have bad dreams.Anyways I will write more tommorrow.Don't have much else to talk about right now.

"event","I had the craziest dream last night..It's really no secret that I love to travel.Well I had this dream that I travelled to England and had a blast..I hung out at the hottest night clubs and sipped capacchinos with the most beautiful faces as company...I love being surrounded by beautiful women..I think my downfall in life will be a woman..What can I say? I love pussy...Some of the world's strongest,wealthiest,and most important men in history all went down because of the women by their side.Crazy huh? I mean these men had everything..Money,women,security.Everything a man coud ask for.They never saw it coming.Their own woman.Backstabs them.I am sure I will go down like that.I would do anything for my woman..And alot of women out there would take advantage of that fact..That's why it is always important to really know the people you allow in your heart..Anyways back to my dream..I met this awesome English girl who let me crash at her place..We had so much fun...I have absolutely no idea who she is or why she was in my dreams but she was..She's a bruntette,with blue eyes,tall,nice long torso,toned arms and legs.I don't even know her name.Maybe I will see her again.Anyways I am leaving tomorrow for Easter vacation..I need to get away for a bit..Even though I just got back, I am ready to leave again..I will write again later annd I will try to update over the weekend....Bye for now.

"event","Well I just finish eating a couple of hours ago.I watched The Bachelor....There are some really sexy women on there.I can't understand how so many sexy,young,independant,wonderful women are single in this world.You would think that they would all be taken..That's life though..Relationships are so difficult to last in.Especially when you deal with two very different personalities.I really want to find my soulmate...I actually think I already met her...I think I fucked up though..If it's fate we will meet in life again..I truly believe that...Serendipity(a fortunate accident)...I have just always loved thre idea of being in love..Life to me seems pointless sometimes without love in your life.I think I want to have two children.Hopefully both boys..I don't think I want to have a girls because i don't want to deal with all the girl troubles..Anyways,I think I have narrowed down the list of five women that i think are the most beautiful women in the world.They are:
Kate Moss
Audrery Tautou
Kate Beckinsale
Jessica Alba.....and 
Angelina Jolie..

Not all in that order...
I really like Kate Beckinsale...She is so stunningly beautiful..I love her english accent..I think i have a thing for english women..Notice Kate Moss on the list..I think Kate B. is a Leo..and Kate Moss is a Capricorn...Both great signs..You want to know something wierd?I always had this dream that I am going to end up marrying a french or english woman and that I am going to live in a cute little english home..Who knows...I guess I will just have to wait and see..Anyways that's it for now...I'll write again tommorrow...Good night...

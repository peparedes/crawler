i guess it's true that you don't completely know what you have until it's gone. well in this case, almost.
i couldn't see myself without him.





he called me at 10:45 to tell me something.
he said ""i woke up this morning and my grandmother was here. and i'm sorry, but i won't be here on valentine's day because i have to take her back to charleston."" and it's a 2 and a half hour drive where she lives.
i'm a little disappointed.
no big deal.
valentine's day is way overrated.

who wants to be my valentine, instead?"

then i got tired of raking the leaves and i took the rake and started spinning in circles in the middle of my yard. i just kept spinning and spinnning until i decided to drop the rake. i stopped but my body didn't, it kept spinning. it was awesome. i felt really... free. wow, that was gay.

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Once <BR>on white paper, with blue lines, he wrote <BR>another poem <BR>and he called it ""Autumn"" <BR>because that was the name of the season <BR>and that's what it was about <BR>and the teacher gave him an ""A"" <BR>and told him to write more clearly <BR>and his mother didn't hang it on the kitchen <BR>door because the door had <BR>just been painted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>That was the year that his sister got glasses <BR>with black frames and thick lenses <BR>and the kids told him why his mother and <BR>father kissed a lot <BR>and that Father Tracy smoked cigars <BR>and left the butts on the pews <BR>and the girl round the corner laughed <BR>when he went to see Santa Claus <BR>at Woolworths <BR>and his father stopped tucking him in at bed <BR>at night <BR>and got mad when he cried for him to.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Once <BR>on paper torn from his notebook, he wrote <BR>another poem <BR>and he called it ""Question Marked Innocence"" <BR>because that was the name of his grief <BR>and that's what it was all about <BR>and the professor gave him an ""A"" <BR>and a strange and steady look <BR>and his mother never hung it in the kitchen <BR>door because he never let her see it.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Once <BR>at 3am he tucked himself in bed, his father <BR>snoring loudly <BR>he tried another poem <BR>on the back of a brown paper bag <BR>and called it absolutely nothing, <BR>because that's what it was all about <BR>and he gave himself an ""A"" <BR>and a slash on each damned wrist <BR>and hung it on the bathroom door <BR>because this time<BR>he didn't think he could reach the kitchen.</DIV>"

"event","<P>i'm so glad it's thanksgiving break. even though i got up at 930 this morning anyway and couldn't go back to sleep because i felt too horrible.&nbsp;i got home from school yesterday and puked my brains out. so i laid in bed all day yesterday until about 830. matt came home. he had gotten the xbox fixed and got a new war game. call of duty 2: big red one. that's what i wanted. unfortunately i didn't get to play it because he was too busy. and i don't want to start today because i'm scared someone will call me and ask me to do something. if i start, i don't stop for a very long time. because we all know i'm an extreme gamer, right? bahhaha. i smelled like jp until i took a shower. i feel clean now, but i don't smell him anymore. i'm going to a show in charlotte friday with emily and shane and some peoples. that should be fun. i'm bored. i'm hoping to see RENT tonight. i mean ever since it started being advertised, i like almost piss my pants everytime the commercial comes on. it excites me. and i cried because i wanted to buy the soundtrack a couple weeks ago, but it was $25 and all i had was a $20. i'm overly sentimental about meaningless possessions. i can't wait to eat thanksgiving dinner tomorrow @ grandma's. i'm hungry.</P>"

"event","my aunt pam died on tuesday at the age of 47. and she died of cancer. she fought cancer for five years and she put up a hell of a fight. she was an amazing person. if you knew her, you couldn't help but love her. She was so generous and so fucking nice. God, she was amazing. So amazing.. and so many people loved her that around 850 people came to visitation. Then a lot of them went to the funeral. Before we went in to sit down in the family section this morning before the funeral, the pastor told us that he had been doing funerals for 3 1/2 years and in all of those years he had never seen so many people at a funeral. It was so incredible how many people loved that woman. Hm."

"event","Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines
    he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Chops""
    because that was the name of his dog
And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
    and a gold star
And his mother hung it on the kitchen door
    and read it to his aunts
That was the year Father Tracy
    took all the kids to the zoo
And he let them sing on the bus
And his little sister was born
    with tiny toenails and no hair
And his mother and father kissed a lot
And the girl around the corner sent him a 
    Valentine signed with a row of X's
    and he had to ask his father what the X's meant
And his father always tucked him in bed at night
And was always there to do it.

Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines
    he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Autumn""
    because that was the name of hte season
And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
    and asked him to write more clearly
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
    because of its new paint
And the kids told him
    that Father Tracy smoked cigars
And left butts on the pews
And sometimes they would burn holes
That was the year his sister got glasses
    with thick lenses and black frames
And the girl around the corner laughed
    when he asked her to go see Santa Claus
And the kids told him why
    his mother and father kissed a lot
And his father never tucked him bed at night
And his father got mad
    when he cried for him to do it.

Once on a paper torn from his notebook
    he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Innocence: A Question""
    because that was the question about his girl
And that's what it was all about
And his professor gave him an A
    and a strange steady look
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
    because he never showed it to her
That was the year that Father Tracy died
And he forgot how the end
    of the Apostle's Creed went
And he caught his sister
    making out on the back porch
And his mother and father never kissed
    or even talked
And the girl around the corner
    wore too much  makeup
That made him cough when he kissed her
    but he kissed her anyway
    because that was the thing to do
And at three AM he tucekd himself into bed
    his father snoring soundly.

That's why on the back of a brown paper bag
    he tried another poem
And he called it ""Absolutely Nothing""
Because that's what it was really all about
And he gave himself an A
and a slash on each damned wrist
And he hung it on the bathroom door
    because this time he didn't think
    he could reach the kitchen.

so i checked out a book that has caught my interest called
<i>the perks of being a wallflower.</i>
i have read 74 pages today.
and i'm far from done for the night.
you guys should look into it.
it's about a boy in high school.
and all of his firsts.
first time getting high, drunk, having sex, everything.

"event","i'm tired of softball on the weekends.
i miss this summer when i practically lived at emily's.
and i miss samantha duncan.
and as of today, i miss coach bailey. driver's ed is over.
coach bailey and i were tight.
and now i have gay street law.
there's not a single person in there i prefer to associate with.
there's a bunch of fake skanks i'd like to punch in the face.
but my teacher said she gives us 5 passes for the quarter and we can use them for whatever we want, including going to another teacher's class.
so i'll probably use all five to go and chill in coach bailey's class.

and my mom said that if i didn't have at least a C in english on my report card, then i'm grounded from everything. pretty much my life. no jp, no phone, no computer, no friends, no going anywhere, nobody here. yeah, it's over. so if i don't have at least a 77 then i'm fucked. and last i checked, which was monday, i had a 73. and i don't know what after that."

dude. tonight i totally saved our game.
it was the last inning and we were losing 3-1. if we didn't get at least 2 runs to tie, we would have lost. there were two outs and i was up to bat. we had 2 runners on 1st & 2nd. and then i ripped one to the fence between center and right and got to third. and drove those 2 runs in. yeiptheitaheitoapthnaope.
then we went into extra innings and then finally won.

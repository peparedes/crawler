"event","Happy Birthday, Ninomiya-san. :)

Four long years has passed since <a href=""http://melodyofmysoul.livejournal.com/30271.html"" target=""_blank"">my last letter</a>. From that time until last year, you were always just Ninomiya-san to me. I have always admired you for your numerous talents (most of them self-taught), and have respected your views on relationships and work (or at least those you choose to reveal in public) despite a lot of them running contrary to my own. You were always the person with the witty comeback, the person who used proper Japanese more than anyone else in variety shows, the Arashi member who has never eaten with just Ohno-san. For a long time, I thought it would stay that way.

But my mind has a funny way of processing things, a way which I still don't quite understand. I've literally dreamt of you twice (at least from what my brain allows me to recall), and both times in strange yet romantic situations. (I've only dreamt of Jun once, and zilch for the other members.) A friend who can interpret dreams once mentioned that I may be repressed romantically (which is not wrong; I don't have a boyfriend), but I always wonder why it's your face I've been seeing in my dreams.

Maybe I'll chalk it up to some odd connection to you either through the few opinions/life views we may have in common, or by some far-fetched possibility of bumping into you in person someday, or maybe by some other factor I can't think of right now. But whatever happens from now, I'm glad you've left a good impression to me and to those who love and cherish you. Please keep on respecting the work you do and never settling for giving less than what you think your fans will appreciate. Please keep on being you, I don't think we'd want it any other way.

Happy birthday! :)"

"event","In a comment thread in one of <lj user=""finanwen"">'s entries in <lj user=""g_clef_no_arash"">, I mentioned that I have a list of songs and instrumentals to transcribe. Currently, there are 6 songs and 6 instrumentals in that list. I had always thought that it would remain just that: a list, with no results whatsoever.

Apparently I was wrong.

<img alt="""" border=""0"" title="""" src=""http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6xacoRYia1qew7g8.png"" />

These are the first 7 measures of my transcription of ""Yurameku Kimochi,"" one of the instrumentals from Hana Yori Dango Season 1. A search on Youtube for renditions of this track produce quite a number of results, and it's not far-fetched that someone else has already transcribed this.

There's still a long way to go, and notice that I haven't even started on the lower clef. (I'm not sure why it isn't an F-clef, maybe the left hand notes are high enough for a G-clef?) I don't know when I'll finish this, but I definitely will. Based on the file history, I started on this last July 9, 2011. That's a year and a day from today. Maybe, just maybe, I was meant to find this piece at this particular time. Because life works like that.

Maybe those 6 years of formal piano studies won't be a waste, after all."

"event","Yes, I'm alive and actually in the workplace. XD I hope everyone's doing okay.

There's this thing I'm currently working on, and I'm planning to put it out on the Web for public consumption. But certain factors are hindering me from doing so, and I need your help. This project is basically a combination of 2 things that I'm currently into: music and the Japanese language.

<lj-cut text=""If you&#39;re a fan of even just a subset of Japanese language and/or music, please read on!""><b><u>About the project</u></b>
Since I'm self-studying Japanese at the moment, I decided to do <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana"" target=new>furigana</a> for song lyrics. The idea is inspired by a friend who shared to me that belting out Japanese songs in karaoke helped her a lot in learning kanji. (That friend of mine currently has a JLPT Level 2 certification and is normally assigned to Japanese projects because of her proficiency in the language.) So I thought if I would provide furigana for song lyrics, it would help other people like me in learning how to read kanji.

<b><u>How I'm going about it</u></b>
I pick a song from the Japanese albums I physically have and look at the song booklets that come with them. I manually encode the lyrics in an HTML file, making sure that it will be read by all major browsers. There's such a thing called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character"" target=""new"">Ruby characters</a> which is especially made for annotations like furigana. It allows for easier encoding but it's not compatible with some browsers like IE so I'm resorting to something more primitive in terms of coding standards. As of now, I've finished Arashi's <i>Rock this</i> and I plan to move on to the other songs in the Beautiful World album.

<b><u>Here's where you come in</u></b>
I need feedback on A LOT of things:
<ul><li><b>Is there an audience for this sort of thing?</b> I personally find a kick in doing furigana, but if I am going to make it available for other people I have to somewhat ensure that someone else will actually make use of what I did.</li><li><b>Should I post romaji along with the furigana?</b> This seems to be the more beneficial approach since there might be some people who don't understand hiragana or katakana. Another approach would be to make my own hiragana-katakana-romaji guide since I'm aware there are different styles of writing romaji.</li><li>Currently, I'm considering posting the lyrics on Blogspot since the CSS overrides that I need seem to work there. I can't seem to work around the LJ codes for now. If anyone has suggestions for <b>other blogging platforms that allow custom CSS overrides for free</b> where I can post, that would be great. :)</li></ul>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone!

<b>EDIT (2/06, 5:47PM GMT+8):</b> Tumblr's a no-go. It doesn't even support tables. *headdesk*</lj-cut>"

The only thing I'm good at nowadays in the LJ universe is lurking, reading fics, and mirroring VSA episodes over at <lj user=""last_of_days"">. Most of my internet time is now spent on <a href=""http://adettenotadeth.tumblr.com/"" target=""new"">Tumblr</a> and <a href=""http://www.plurk.com/pentupsentiment"" target=""new"">Plurk</a>. It's probably because I feel more comfortable letting loose in those websites, the former being one big bundle of crazy, and the latter because it's easy to flail without feeling the need to make posts longer than three sentences. I guess in those aspects this journal is still a bit more special, because if I post here it usually means I thought about what I typed. Whereas in Tumblr and Plurk I can get away with reblogs and short sentences (though I can be capable of posting the occasional tl;dr post such as <a href=""http://adettenotadeth.tumblr.com/post/12461248552/methinks-the-worldwide-act-award-at-the-mtv-emas"" target=""new"">this</a>).

So for those who are interested, what have I been up to lately?

<lj-cut text=""Not particularly coherent, but possibly lengthy. Yes, this is my definition of a thought-out post."">--*--*--

I have a full-time job! Today was actually my first day, and though it was as slow as I predicted (I only installed stuff on my work laptop) I'm looking forward to the projects I'll be assigned to. I'm working for an IT company that has a worldwide presence so it's not bad at all for my first real job. Turnover is pretty high, though, and right now I'm just hoping that the job will keep me interested enough to stay for around a year or two. It might take me a few days to warm up to my teammates (I hardly talked to anyone for the whole day) but still, they seem to be nice enough to work with.

This all means, though, that my fangirl time has been greatly reduced. That also goes for the time I spend on music in general, and my study time for the JLPT this December. And I'm already getting a bit panicky about the JLPT because there's still a lot that I need to study. &gt;_&lt; Right now I can be more lax because there's still not much to do and we have the liberty to read and study and surf the internet as long as our work's done. But when training starts, goodbye free time. :|

--*--*--

Mom's been really sick these past few days, and I don't like how it coincided with me starting work because I don't have as much time to do chores as I used to. :( She'll be seeing the doctor tomorrow both for her cough and her cardio-related checkup. I'm really hoping she gets much better soon.

--*--*--

My sister's phone died on her a few days ago so she had to buy a new one. I'm so envying her right now because she got an entry-level Samsung phone running on Android, and it only cost her around 150 USD. That includes a warranty of 2 years! I'm just glad that she likes it a lot.

As for me, I might need a new mp3 player soon. My 2nd generation iPod nano has been reduced to an oversized Shuffle ever since its screen went all white. Now, it occasionally dies on me even there's still some power left in the battery. :|</lj-cut>"

"event","This wasn't the entry I originally intended to compose after quite a time of absence, but it was spurred by an exchange between me and <lj user=""finanwen""> on Tumblr, what with Arashi's new single coming up.

When I started earning money of my own, I made sure to legally buy music of artists that I genuinely liked. I'm against piracy to a certain extent because making music is not easy, and for some artists they live off entirely on what they earn from their music. Also, artists don't get a big percentage from CD sales. I don't mind downloading an entire album first ""for free"" to have a few listens, just to see if it's worth purchasing an original copy.

Now, though, I'm still kind of jobless. (I'll explain that in the next entry unless something else happens.) Therefore, I don't really have the luxury of buying the CDs I badly want to have. I still have a long list of what I intend to buy with whatever salary I'll have and that will have to wait until I actually get a job. But if I did have money to spend, how much am I willing to shell out and what am I willing to shell it out on?

<lj-cut text=""Wall of text because fandom is srs bzns but money matters much more in my case. There&#39;s also a lot of other things."">Before Arashi came along, I had a HUGE liking for Miura Haruma. What's not to like, really? He's a good actor, he's a good-looking actor (at least 5'10"" in height, smooth-skinned, and smiling eyes *_*), and he seems like such a good guy even off-screen. Ever since I saw him in Bloody Monday I had the urge to watch all his dramas. I eventually ended up asking a friend to buy the <a href=""http://www.asmart.jp/Form/Product/ProductDetail.aspx?shop=0&amp;cat=200209140&amp;swrd=&amp;pid=10002748&amp;vid="" target=""new"">first Haruma x (Sato) Takeru DVD</a>, and he also bought me <a href=""http://www.asmart.jp/Form/Product/ProductDetail.aspx?shop=0&amp;cat=200209&amp;swrd=&amp;pid=10001613&amp;vid="" target=""new"">Haruma's Switch photobook</a> as a gift of sorts.

I watched the DVD at least a couple of times, and I flipped through the photobook at least a couple of times. Some months pass and I realized I don't fangirl over him the way I used to. I find it sad, because I still like Harumacchi a lot. But it's just not the same as before. And now both the DVD and the photobook are in my closet, neglected, and I know they should be in the hands of someone else who would appreciate it more than I would now.

The above is part of the reason why I don't want to invest too much&mdash;financially, at least&mdash;into a fandom. Because I've already had the experience of eventually losing a certain amount of liking for one of them, and I end up thinking that maybe I could have spent my money on something else. (The amount I spent for the DVD could have easily bought me around 3 or 4 CDs here in the Philippines.) I know I could try to sell the DVD along with the photobook to someone else, but...yeah, there's still that hint of regret in me somewhere.

For music, it's a different category for me altogether. I'm much more willing to spend on CDs compared to concert DVDs and other merchandise. For Arashi, though, CDs and concert DVDs are on the same level. (My first Arashi-related purchase is actually the 5x10 Anniversary Concert DVD.) However, I will try my best to be strict with my current <b>no-single policy</b>, unless I have previously listened to the B-sides and I find myself liking them. I'm also refraining from buying shop photos and magazines. (But during my Singapore trip I found myself impulsively buying a magazine with Aiba on the cover. Not surprisingly, I regretted it later after I was tallying my expenses.) Why the restraint, you ask?

Let's take Arashi's upcoming single, for example. The limited edition costs JPY 1470, which is equivalent to around PHP 840. I have no idea on how much shipping to the Philippines costs, but it's safe to say that one would spend at least PHP 1000 for the LE. What can PHP 1000 get you in the Philippines, anyway? Around 10 lunches, or more if you know where to buy cheap food. That's also more than 2x the daily minimum wage here. Oh, and you can buy 2 full albums in a local record bar with that. Furthermore, that would already amount to around 3.5% of my previous salary (which is way above minimum wage).

So no, I will not succumb to JE's wishes of sucking fangirls dry. If there's one good thing that unemployment did to me, it was to make me realize that no matter how much I love my fandoms, there are other, much more important things that I can and have to invest in. However. that's not to say that buying all their singles and albums and DVDs and shop pictures and magazines is bad. But as with all things, I highly suggest to do it in moderation. And you have only yourself to blame if you go broke because of overspending."

Happy birthday! :) This is the 2nd time I'm celebrating your birthday. (Oddly, I'm celebrating it this year by exploring Pottermore LOL! An affirmation to your being a Harry Potter fan, perhaps?)

I think you're one of the few people who can get away with ""bullying"" the other Arashi members despite you being the youngest in the group. XD I find it quite amusing, really. And I like how you do it all out of love for the members, and probably for the fans as well. :D

I've always felt that you're so much more than the character of Domyouji Tsukasa that most people associate with you. True, you're probably a bit of a tsundere and someone who would protect your loved ones to death. But you're also not someone who would do things without thinking of the bigger picture first. You keep a cool head, and you show respect to everyone around you. I really love you (no, not in <i>that</i> way) for being like that.

Thank you for always working hard, and for showing people that there's much more to you than just being a pretty face and a Johnny's ""elite."" Thank you for always making sure that you bring a smile to our faces whenever you plan for Arashi's concerts. (Believe me, if I had the time and the money I would have gone to your concerts in a heartbeat.) Thank you for showing the value of respecting the people in the industry, whether it be your co-actors or the staff, because you have shown that the value of hard work and respect goes a long, long way.

Happy, happy birthday Matsujun. :)"

"event","These are the times I wish I had a midi keyboard, or at least a keyboard with an earphone plug.

Whenever I feel like playing something by ear, I have to do it on our upright piano. Normally I'd love doing it on that because I do have an attachment to that piano. But when everyone else in the house is asleep I can't afford to use it because it'll wake everyone up. :| I know I could just try playing the notes with a virtual keyboard and then transcribe it with the notation software I use, but it's just not the same. :(

And of all the songs I had the urge to try playing, it just had to be Nino's latest solo. I'm scared, really, because it's such a lovely song and I feel that my attempt to play and transcribe it won't do it justice. I've never been this apprehensive about trying to play a song until now."

Happy belated birthday! I'm so sorry this is quite late. However, I do think that the universe compelled me to write to you at this specific time.

Thank you for sharing a part of yourself to us, your fans. I know that you have always been quite reserved and you don't welcome people in your life easily. But the fact that you are able to share your music and your thoughts to us is something that makes us truly happy. We admire you a lot for that, so thank you. :)

Thank you for not backing out of Arashi and Johnny's even when you really wanted to. You sometimes say that when you see Arashi, you only see the other four members. Please remember that it would never be the same if you were not in it. You are one with Arashi, and Arashi is one with you. Don't ever forget that.

Thank you for making beautiful, beautiful music. I've always admired your innate talent in composing songs. Your latest solo is no exception, and is my favorite solo to date. Keep on making beautiful music.

Thank you for being you. We wouldn't want it any other way.

Happy Belated Birthday, Nino. :)"

"event","I got back from Singapore last night and my luggage got switched. Someone else took my bag by mistake while I was in the washroom.

It's pretty traumatic, what with it being my first time travelling alone and all. I can't help but cry when I found out. It's partly my fault because I failed to put a ribbon or tag on that piece of luggage to differentiate it from the others. If I did that I wouldn't be in this mood right now. If that person took a more careful look, he/she would have realized that the lock on the bag is different. Mine was smaller compared to the other, and the lock wasn't Yale.

At first I wasn't too worried because the bag mostly contains used clothes and souvenirs for friends (which they can seriously live without), but then I remembered that the wallet I bought for a cousin's officemate was there too. That ain't cheap.

And I don't like how the airline is handling the situation. I do understand that it's not their fault since they were able to bring the luggage and whatnot, it's just that somebody else took it. What I don't like is that they won't even call the other party to notify him/her that ""Hey, you took the wrong luggage, can you please kindly bring it to the office and we'll give back yours?"" or something along those lines? They should still have the other person's contact information as he/she provided during the ticket booking, right?

I really need to get that bag back.

EDIT: <b>I got it back!</b> Just around 15 minutes after I posted the entry, the airline called me saying that the other party has returned the bag. No stuff missing which is all good, and the other person was very apologetic so I'm quite glad."

"event","...my dear iPod screen? T_T

I've owned a <a href=""http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1353#ipodnano2"" target=blank>2nd generation iPod Nano</a> for around five years, and it's the first item I purchased partly with my own money. (I paid for half of the price, my parents paid for the other half. :P) It's good that it has lasted me this long, and to be fair it can still play music. However, it now functions more like an over-sized iPod Shuffle.

Normally I wouldn't complain about the lack of a working screen, since I can just shuffle the songs and then skip a song when I'm not in the mood to listen to it. But it becomes a problem when there's a specific song I really want to listen to, and especially when I feel like transcribing something. Right now I'm alone in the house so supposedly it's a perfect opportunity to get back to transcribing the Ohoku theme. (I can't play when there are people in the house because it can be distracting to some of them.) However, with the current condition of my iPod I'm not sure I have the patience to sift through 400+ songs just to find what I'm looking for. :("

"event","Why is it that when I declared a semi-hiatus from LJ, I felt the urge to post more? Life, you are crazy.

To be honest I wasn't too sure if I should post this now before the official release date of the single on the 23rd. However, if I don't let this out now it would never get out of my system. So I figured that I'd just get on with it.

I'll be giving comments about each song in the single as well as the PV.

<lj-cut text=""This contains opinions about the single which may be contrary to your own. Read at your own risk.""><b><u>Lotus</u></b>
The first time I heard this song I fell in love with it. The arrangement, the beat, the melody, EVERYTHING was just ear candy. The lyrics are quite typical for an Arashi song but I don't really mind. As for the members' vocals, there's nothing too remarkable except perhaps for the ""Aaah~"" part in the verses. If reports are true that it's Nino who is singing that part, then that's good. I'm not too sure I'd want to hear that part live, though.

<b><u>Ever</u></b>
Like <i>Lotus</i>, I also fell in love with the melody and arrangement from the first listen. I love how the melody suddenly shifts a bit and doesn't really stay in one scale. I had this inexplicable urge to try transcribing it, but unfortunately that would mean waking up the rest of the household since I listened to it at the ungodly hour of 2am. Also, although it's not as singable as Lotus (yet), it's something you'd want to move your head to for some reason.

<b><u>Boom Boom</u></b>
This song fell really short of my expectations. I'm not sure if it's because <i>Lotus</i> and <i>Ever</i> are good, or if it's because I expect almost all songs with Sakurap to be good. It starts off with an okay beat and you can sense that it really has a different feel from the other tracks. However, the vocoder (I'm not sure if that's the right term to use) in the Sakurap part was really unbearable for me. It's weird, because I was able to tolerate <i>Mada Ue Wo</i> so I'm not really averse to using the vocoder to enhance a song. In this case, however, it didn't really enhance anything. If the Sakurap is hard to understand without a vocoder, the vocoder made it worse. It's a pity, since the song seems to have nice lyrics and the melody is also okay.

<b><u>Lotus PV</u></b>
The boys are dancing! And the dancing's REALLY GOOD. Arashi are not really known to be dancers (with the exception of Ohno) but this video might make people think twice. Also, the visuals are just beautiful. Just...beautiful. I'm glad J-Storm finally put some money for a good PV. I'm going to refrain from making more comments because you just HAVE to see the PV. (I'll be updating this post with some screenshots of my own so please watch out for it.)

<b><u>Overall comment</u></b>
It's rare for me to say this, but I think the LE version is worth it because 1) the PV's just WOW, and 2) you won't have to listen to Boom Boom. The only thing missing is a making-of. :( However, if you'd want yourself the karaoke versions of the song then the RE should be okay.</lj-cut>"

"event","So after that <a href=""http://melodyofmysoul.livejournal.com/26409.html"" target=new>heartfelt letter to Sho</a>, I bring a report on my first ever flail day with fellow Arashians that happened on the 23rd. :D I'm not the best storyteller so things might get boring, and that won't probably do justice to what transpired that day. But still, on with the show!<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Here be the long flail. Warning: wall of text and pictures"">It was my first time meeting with Arashians whom I've only known online, though I was comfortable enough since we've known each other for months already. Still, just for me to be more comfortable I decided to invite Nana, a college batchmate and fellow Arashian. The plan was for us to meet up at a nearby landmark and then go to the karaoke place before 3pm. But since I'm not so punctual I left the house at 2:45. The reason? I was downloading the Scene Kokuritsu DVD. :P However, I couldn't finish it in time for the meet so I had to cut it short. I met up with Nana around 3:15 and then proceeded to the karaoke bar.<br /><br />When Nana and I arrived, Dek and Chelli were already in the room and Chelli was so busy decorating the tiramisu cake.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""http://img257.imageshack.us/img257/1198/chellicakecopy.jpg"" /><br />Chelli working hard on the cake</div><br />The icing was so hard to squeeze out that her right hand got cramps. &gt;_&lt; Dek had to take over.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/7946/dekcakecopy.jpg"" /><br />Dek's turn on the cake</div><br />But hey, all for the love of Sho! Eventually, the cake came out like this.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/3511/happybdayshocopy.jpg"" /><br />That's a labor of love, yo! (Though we didn't bake the cake, but still.)</div><br />Krimy and Miao went into the room while all this was going on, and after proper introductions have been made we started getting hyped up by ourselves. And speaking of proper introductions...<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""http://img638.imageshack.us/img638/3457/nanamecopy.jpg"" /><br />L-R: Nana and me<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img535.imageshack.us/img535/994/groupwithichibancopy.jpg"" /><br />L-R: Chelli, Dek, Krimy, Miao, Nana</div><br />In the above picture, all but Miao and Nana are holding the uchiwa of their respective ichiban. Nana's ichiban is Ohno and Miao's is Nino, but unfortunately Aiba and Matsujun had no representatives. :( Poor Jun, he kept being neglected and/or bullied for most of the day. (More on this later.)<br /><br />So we started singing along to the playlist. Mind you, everything was in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana"">furigana</a> so we had a laptop with romaji lyrics to help us. Unfortunately, it couldn't last us for the entire time so we had to make do with whatever Japanese skills we had.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""http://img607.imageshack.us/img607/3760/truthcopy.jpg"" /><br />We sang along with <i>truth</i>...<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/8632/hadashinomiraicopy.jpg"" /><br />...as well as <i>Hadashi no Mirai</i>...<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/5804/guessthesong1copy.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/115/guessthesong2copy.jpg"" /><br />...and many other songs. (Brownie points to those who can guess the songs in the two pictures! :D)</div><br />All the while, we were failing at Sakurap (hello <i>Jidai</i>, <i>Believe</i>, and <i>A Day in Our Life</i> among others) but we nevertheless enjoyed ourselves to the fullest. In the process some of us just HAD to portray our idols in the weirdest ways.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><b>Scenario # 1</b><br /><br /><a target=""_new"" href=""http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3788/shoposes.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/1383/shoposessmall.jpg"" /></a><br /><span style=""font-size: smaller; "">(Click on the picture for high-res version!)</span><br />Yes, Sho, this is how we show our love for you.<br /><br /><b>Scenario # 2</b><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/3308/taksilwithstripcopy.jpg"" /><br /><strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); "">Breaking News:</span></strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); ""> Captain Failboat catches fangirl with Sexual Powerhouse</span></div><br />So who's at fault here? I know Chelli would want the original pairing to be Sho-fangirl with Nino as the 3rd wheel. As for me, I'd want a Sakumiya with the fangirl as the 3rd wheel HAHAHA! (Sorry Chelli, let me imagine my OTP together even for just a while. XD)<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><b>Scenario # 3</b><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/4820/img0062copy.jpg"" /><br />Ya like my dancers?</div><br />The picture doesn't do it justice at all, but Chelli and Nana were our backup dancers for the day. :D I'm not sure when they decided to just dance along to the songs, but they did. Somewhere in the middle of it all, a conversation went something like this:<br /><br /><b>Others:</b> The two of you should apply at Johnny's as backup dancers!<br /><b>Chelli:</b> Yeah we really should! XD<br /><b>Nana:</b> I think one of us should pull off a <i>Hana Kimi</i> and see which Arashi member falls in love with us LOL!<br /><br />Yeah, we were just high on...something. I'm still not sure what. Maybe it really was the cocoa powder of the tiramisu cake.<br /><br />When it was almost 6pm we decided to sing the last song which was <i>Monster</i>. Naturally, Chelli and Nana were discussing who will do which parts. And then...<br /><br /><b>Nana:</b> Wait, who's going to do Matsujun's part on the floor?<br /><b>All:</b> ...<br /><b>Chelli:</b> Let's just place Matsujun's uchiwa on the floor!<br /><b>Dek:</b> Oh no, you're NOT doing that to my uchiwa! (Note: Dek owns all the uchiwas in the pictures.)<br /><br />In the end Chelli decided to do Matsujun's part. XD<div style=""text-align: center; ""><br />***</div><br />After we paid our bill, we decided to proceed to a nearby coffee shop to do even more flailing. XD<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" src=""http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/427/img0064copyo.jpg"" /><br />Again, Matsujun is neglected and Aiba is covered. :(</div><br />This is when we decided to eat the tiramisu cake. Apparently that was the best (or worst) thing we did for that day. If you think we weren't hyper enough at the karaoke room, the cake did us in and turned whatever's left of our brain cells into fantastic crack.<br /><br />It started out simple enough, with each of us narrating how we didn't use to even like Arashi before. Before Arashi, Chelli, Miao and Krimy were big J-Rock fans (and they still are, actually). Chelli even narrated her very cool experience of getting to stalk L'Arc~en~Ciel in the airport during their concert in Hongkong! They got introduced to Johnnys music through one of their <u>male</u> sempai. As for Dek, she got introduced through Gokusen as well as Stand Up!! but thought that Sho was ugly when she first watched Yamada Taro Monogatari. Nana got hooked through Gokusen, and you can find her &quot;story&quot; <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T49HSCUtbus"">here</a>. As for me, I just kind of swore to myself that I'd never like this group because my pop music craze ended with the Backstreet Boys. XD<br /><br />After that, Dek and I started to discuss some things. When we were done, the other 4 were in the process of making a very epic crack fic. I think only Filipino Arashians will be able to relate to it, though, since it involves one of the TV programs shown here. Someone should really get around to writing that. XD<br /><br />Nana and I had to leave at around 8:30pm so I'm not sure what the others did after that. :P<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; "">***</div></lj-cut><br />To be honest I never thought I'd meet with fellow Arashians within less than a year of me joining the fandom. But I'm really glad I did. :) Here's to more flail days filled with singing, dancing and crack!"

"event","Happy Birthday Sho Sakurai. :)

There's just so much that can be said about you, but I fear that no words can truly express how much I admire you. It hasn't even been a year since I got to know your name, but already I want to meet you and actually talk to you like a normal person.

When a member's birthday comes, I normally post a picture along with a greeting. In your case, I can't seem to find the perfect picture. I don't know if it's because you're a man of many faces. One time you're an idol singing and rapping your heart out, and the next you're a newscaster bringing the news in a very dignified manner (and wearing a suit that will never ever look bad on you). At times, you're Mr. Failboat, the butt of jokes and physically-demanding activities. And then of course there's your Anan spread, but truth be told that's not where I like you best. :P (Sho-wifeys please don't kill me.)

I like it best when you genuinely smile or laugh. I think that's the biggest reason why I fell for you. It's odd, because Aiba is sunshine in human form and more often than not Nino and Jun have really charming smiles. But it's yours that I always look for, and when I see your smile or hear your laugh I feel my day getting better already.

You inspire me in so many ways, and I can only hope to have even just 70% of your work ethic. Your dedication to the things you are involved in never ceases to amaze me. I hope you continue to inspire more people.

I may never be able to meet you in person, but I hope that my love reaches you somehow.

Happy birthday, Sho. :)"

"event","If you read the comments at <lj comm=""arashicrackaday""/>, you'd probably know the result of my thesis defense. But the majority of my f-list who probably don't (either it's because they're not Arashians or if they are, they can't be bothered to read through all the comments in the comm), let me give a long (and I mean <i>really</i> long) rundown of what happened.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Before: Re-schedules and a messed-up presentation"">As I mentioned in my <a href=""http://melodyofmysoul.livejournal.com/25718.html&quot;"">previous entry</a>, the university kept on pushing back the schedule of my defense because my faculty adviser fell sick. Finally, 2 days prior to the 12th I got an SMS from my adviser asking me if I wanted to go through my presentation with her. Naturally, I had to agree mainly because I wasn't sure of what I should emphasize on. (At this point I was berating myself so much for forgetting how we made our thesis presentation two years ago.) So I went to school on the afternoon of the 11th and went through a mock defense.<br /><br />Based on my standards (and probably my adviser's though she didn't say it out loud), it was a complete disaster.<br /><br />To give a bit of background as to my standards, I studied in a high school which placed a great emphasis on English communication. We even had separate subjects for oral and written English (Speech and Grammar, respectively), and for the first 3 years each class (consisting of around 35-40 students) is further split into two for Speech. I wasn't the best in the class, but our teachers made sure that by the end of each year we would have improved on our oral and written skills considerably. By the time I entered university, I had a fairly better command of the English language compared to my peers to the point that some of them thought I was a show-off just because I can speak and write in straight English.<br /><br />And during that mock defense, everything I learned in my high school Speech class just flew out the window. I stuttered a lot, did not make eye contact, and just stumbled through the presentation overall. It was just <i>horrible</i>. Content-wise, I failed to give examples to the concepts I was explaining so my adviser asked me to add those to the slides. Also, I had to illustrate the flow of the algorithm I was to implement. By the end of the mock defense, I felt so down but I knew I had to work on a lot of things.</lj-cut><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""D-day: I thought I'd go grouchy but I knew I couldn't afford to."">On the day of the defense, I woke up at 6 in the morning after having around 4 hours of sleep. I initially thought of pulling an all-nighter to finish my slides but I knew that it wouldn't bode well for me so I thought I'd finish the slides in the morning. I took a bath, ate some leftover oatmeal from the day before, and then had my dad bring me to university. I arrived at a quarter after 8am, supposedly with 45 minutes to spare since I was scheduled to defend at 9am. I finished up my slides in the building lobby until my adviser called me into the conference room at 8:55. That time, I panicked because I wasn't finished with my slides and I thought the other panelists would already be there. Turns out she just wanted me to wait in the conference room. :P So I got to finish the basic presentation by 9:05, and was able to add relevant animation by around 9:20.<br /><br />By this time, one of the panelists (let's call him ABB) has not yet arrived. I heard the other panelist (let's call her ECO) saying &quot;<i>Si ABB nga yung nagsabi ng 9am, siya pa yung wala!</i>&quot; [trans: It was ABB who scheduled this at 9am and he's the one who's not yet here!] I could tell she was a bit pissed. My thesis adviser and the department secretary came into the conference room apologizing to me haha! :P It felt a bit good, actually. On the not-so-good side my nervousness was replaced with boredom and a tiny bit of irritability, so I connected the room's only LAN cable to the laptop and had a chat with whoever was online. Finally, ABB arrived at 10:30, or 1 1/2 hours after the scheduled start of defense. Oddly enough I was supposed to finish at exactly that time, but it was a good thing that I didn't have any other pending appointments and my panelists didn't yet have classes to handle as well.<br /><br />The defense started, and it went far better as opposed to the previous day. It was still below my standards, though, mainly because I still stumbled through some of it. A big consolation was that the panelists understood what I wanted to do and how I wanted to do it. That didn't stop them from grilling me afterwards, though. Most of the questions focused on the analysis part of my thesis, which I apparently did not give enough emphasis on. They then asked me to step out of the room for a bit, and by that time I was just relieved to have finished my defense.</lj-cut><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""After, a.k.a. the TL;DR version"">When I was called back into the room, the panelists gave the verdict.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); ""><span style=""font-size: medium; "">CONDITIONAL PASS!</span></span></strong><br /><img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/9696/b4cfb3ebbcee10happysj89.gif"" /><br /><span style=""font-size: smaller; "">(GIF credits to its creator)</span></div><br />It basically means I pass if I submit the revisions on time, and I had a major revision regarding the analysis part (as expected) but otherwise it was all good. I'm going to meet my adviser tomorrow for further discussion, but right now I'm just so happy that I'll be able to finish my thesis. I've put it off for too long, after all.</lj-cut><br /><br />Fangirl flailing will resume soon, I hope. There's just too much to flail about nowadays. XD"

"event","First off, Happy New Year everyone! I know it's been almost a week since we ushered in 2011, but I've been busy with some things.

Before I move on to the main point of the post, I'd like to ask for prayers for my thesis adviser. She hasn't been feeling well (I'm presuming it's vertigo since she had it last month) and has not reported to school since the new term started 2 days ago. My original defense schedule has been pushed back a day further due to her absence, and although this will give me more time to polish things I'm more worried about her health. She's due to take a year-long leave of absence starting May, and I can't help but think that this may be one of her reasons. She's not old at all (probably in her late 30s or early 40s), so I'm really concerned.

<lj-cut text=""So what is this post really all about?"">Moving on, I'm sure Arashians are already aware that our boys won't be appearing in some magazines as much as they used to. A lot of fans are naturally frustrated with this development, and I myself am wondering if the Wink Up message board would still be fun to read without the Ohmiya love. But I choose to look at the other side of things. It may not be too significant, but this can mean that Arashi will have even just a little more free time than they used to. And with how busy things can get this year (Nino's promotions for Gantz, Aiba's drama, Sho's promotions for Kamisama no Karute as well as a rumored drama, etc.) I think they'll need all the R&R they can get. 

As for the fans, it'll just give us more money to spend for their albums and singles. And that's never a bad thing, is it? :D</lj-cut>"

To be honest, I'm supposed to be finishing up a draft for my fan letter to Sho but I can't seem to find the inspiration to continue. At this rate, I won't be able to finish writing it in time for his birthday. But I'll choose to take that as a good thing since my letter won't be lost in the sea of messages that he'll probably get at that time.

And Aiba has always been proud of how much of a tsukkomi Nino is.

As time passed by, however, there were instances when Aiba becomes tsukkomi-like and hits Nino on the head.

But most of the time, Aiba's just his hyper, excited self. But why does that make Nino mad?

Aiba's the only one who can get away with being all cute to Nino.
<img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://theeasyview.com/members/melodyofmysoul/Aimiya05_1_20101222235508.gif"" />

In fact, Nino likes being all cute and cozy with Aiba as well!

And if given the chance, he'll probably do it again and again.

<lj-cut text=""Bonus solo Aiba GIFs, because I can"">BONUS: Ever since I watched the subbed episode of HnA with Aiba dribbling a basketball, I've had this longing of watching him play the game seriously.

With just these two GIFs, he's oozing with indescribable sexiness. What more when he's playing an entire game? (I hope someone else agrees with me on this one or I might just find myself weird haha :P)</lj-cut>

I seriously need to find a good solo Aiba userpic."

For the past two years or so I've posted a Christmas wishlist in my Facebook or Multiply account so that my friends and family would have an idea of what I'd like to get for Christmas. I normally don't get anything from that list, though, mainly because they're probably too expensive or too hard to get. And while I'm grateful for whatever I receive, there have been times when I really have no use for a certain gift. (I'm sure all of us have experienced this at least once in our lives.) So for the next years I'm thinking of creating sort of an anti-wishlist, which will contain things I'd rather <b>not</b> receive. But I don't know how I'll manage that without sounding too ungrateful or spoiled. :|"

"event","Real life's been trying to kill me slowly, so I'll distract myself for a while. :P (Yes, it's around 3am where I am right now and I don't feel sleepy at all.)

First off, I'm now a co-moderator of G Clef no Arashi! It hasn't even been a year since I became part of the Arashi fandom, but when <lj user=""thefortysecond""> created this community I knew I had to become active somehow. Apart from its uniqueness from other Arashi-related LJ communities, it was something I was genuinely interested in visiting. Good thing she was looking for a co-moderator so I sent in an application right away. Thanks again for accepting me, 42! :)

Please join <lj user=""g_clef_no_arash"">! :D

But though the community has rekindled my interest in attempting to do piano covers of Arashi songs, it has also made me painfully aware of what I lack, at least musically.

<lj-cut text=""And this is where I ramble on and on about my musical history, being devoid of emotion and my frustrations in learning how to play by ear."">When I was around 8 years old, my sister got a toy piano as a birthday present. It only had 2 or 3 octaves, and the black keys didn't even make the correct sounds. Still, we 3 siblings (me, my sister and our older brother) loved playing with it. Eventually, all the key pressing led to me and my brother being able to play ""Happy Birthday"" and ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" by ear. That was our first foray into music, so to speak.

Two years later, I decided to take piano lessons for the summer. I already knew how to read notes because we had music classes in school so reading score sheets wasn't too hard. As expected, I initially had difficulty playing with both hands but I got over that. I continued my formal piano studies for an additional 6 years until I decided to stop it altogether to focus on my academics. Now that I think about it, it's probably good that I stopped at that point.

In all those years I studied and practiced, I learned so much about the rudiments of music. Transposition, note values, the difference between three-four and three-eight, chords, tremolos, and what-else-have-you. I've played sonatinas, waltzes, and other classical pieces whose composers' names I can hardly pronounce, much more memorize. I had my share of recitals, as well as inter-music school competitions. One can say I've had a lot of experience, but there was one important thing which my piano teachers have failed to impart: <i>feel</i> the music. They were so focused on teaching how to properly play trills and triplets; everything was just so structured.

My sister often tells me that I lack emotion when I play music, and I actually agree with her. For one thing, I never learned how to properly apply crescendos and pianissimos, what more improvise a certain piece of music. It makes me think if I have to experience extreme joy or sadness to be able to ""properly"" play a piece. Even if I manage to memorize a certain song (i.e. Arashi's ""Everything""), there's just something in the way I play which I'm not really happy with.

Also, I've always wanted to try playing songs by ear and notating them but I don't have that much skill as compared to my brother. (He's the one who got all the musically-related genes, really. He can play the guitar, the piano, and a bit of the drums. He never played the violin before, but when he borrowed one from a friend he was able to produce sounds properly after just a few tries.) I can only play and notate the basic melody at most; ask me to do the chords and/or the left hand part and I'll just give you a blank stare in return. Unfortunately, even if I had the time to practice I'd be disturbing the peace because I'd probably be on the piano even while everyone else has gone to bed.

I know I shouldn't take for granted the things that I am capable of, but oftentimes I feel that they're not enough.</lj-cut>"

"event","No 30-day Arashi challenge for today, not when the Philippines is in its current situation. I know I don't normally post real-life stuff, but now I feel I have to.

If you haven't been keeping tabs on the news, some tourists from Hong Kong were taken hostage by a former police officer. Unfortunately, some of the hostages and the hostage taker himself died after the 9-hour standoff. I still believe it's an isolated case, and something that could happen in other parts of the world. Unfortunately, because of the media feasting on the situation the whole thing had to be shown to the entire world via CNN, BBC and other prominent international news channels. According to an acquaintance it was also reported in News Zero.

I feel sad not just because people died, or because the police really mishandled the situation, or because the media feasted on it like it was some action movie. I feel sad that it came at a time when the new government is not even 100 days old. It came at a time when people have started to at least feel a bit more hopeful that the country can change for the better.

I am pissed at the people who have complained about how things went, when we ourselves have not done everything we could for the betterment of the Philippines. I could go on and on about this, but truthfully I'm also tired after following the news. Hopefully, though, I won't get tired of keeping tabs on what will happen after today."

Today's challenge focuses on my <b><u>favorite Arashi DVD</u></b>. In my case, it has to be the <b>5x10 Anniversary Concert DVD</b>. That's the only one I own and I haven't had the time and/or money to buy and/or download others. :P To fans, what other concert DVDs do you recommend for me to watch?

I didn't touch on <i>kagero</i> too much today. I think I need to know more about chord progressions so that I can proceed with the piece further."

Fangirl rave for the day: Sho got to interview <u>the</u> Mikhail Gorbachev! I really, really hope someone would translate that. It'll be interesting to see how the two of them talked about the disarmament of nuclear weapons.

If you're going to talk about a song, currently it's <i>Magical Song</i>, Aiba's solo from their latest album. I love how upbeat the song is. It's like the song was meant for Aiba or Aiba was meant for the song. Either way, the two are meant for each other. XD

<div align=""center""><lj-embed id=""18""/></div>
In terms of a performance of a solo song, it has to be <i>Niji</i>. It still remains one of my favorite songs as well, and it is what made me respect Ninomiya much more as an artist.

"event","For some reason, I can't get Arashi's <i>kagero</i> out of my head and it's not really in the last song syndrome (LSS) kind of way. It's not even my favorite song from their latest album (that honor goes to <i>Magical Song</i>), but it's challenging me to test my almost-dormant skills in playing by ear. Not that I was ever superb at it, but somehow my siblings and I were able to play ""Happy Birthday"" properly on a toy piano without the aid of notes. I was 8 years old at that time and I didn't start formal lessons on the piano until 2 years later.

With that toy piano I started playing simple nursery rhymes by ear, and as I got older there were some attempts to play melodies of modern songs. However, my biggest frustration is that I can only catch the main melody. Ask me to provide chords or at least the ""left hand"" part (in piano terms) of a song and I'd probably give you a blank stare. Hopefully, <i>kagero</i> will be the first song I'll be able to play completely by ear. It's going to take a while since I don't have the gift of absolute pitch and my ears tend to deceive me at times. But when I'm able to play it decently and/or properly notate it as a piano score, I'm going to share it to the fandom. :)

Model Aiba is &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;! The best thing about Aiba is that you don't really know what to expect from his photo shoots. He can pull off the genki, childlike look as well as the hot, sensual look. Very very danger! XD

While me and my sister were watching the video, she was practically raving about <b>everything</b>: shirtless Taeyang, Taeyang's jacket, the choreography, shirtless Taeyang, the costumes of the back-up dancers, shirtless Taeyang, Taeyang's other jacket, and did I mention shirtless Taeyang?!? *_*

I skipped the challenge yesterday, just because of a lack of a memory card for the camera. Plus, my sister borrowed the memory card reader. :|

One of my friends worked in Japan for a few months, and before he came back I asked him to buy this for me. It's worth every single yen, believe me. :D</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Addendum: a not-so-Arashi-related item"">Since this isn't completely Arashi-related it's not really part of the challenge, but I thought I'd share it to you anyway.

Tokujo Kabachi!! Photobook</div>
My friend gave this to me as a birthday present. To be more accurate, I asked her to give it to me (mainly because she asked me what I wanted). XD I love Sho in a suit. Plus, it has cast interviews too so I can use it to practice reading Nihongo. :D</lj-cut>

I watched Arashi's performance of <i>Blue</i> in their 2003 How's It Going concert, and being the casual pianist (is there such a term?) that I am, I searched for piano covers of the song in YouTube. Surprisingly, I found a cover of the song by the members of B2ST. For those who aren't aware, B2ST/BEAST is a Korean idol group who debuted in October 2009. They sang the cover in July 2009, when one of the members AJ (now more known as Ki Kwang) was still a solo artist. He was having a showcase in Japan at the time and the other members of B2ST were more of his backups, if I'm not mistaken.

<lj-cut text=""Videos + comments under the cut""><div align=""center""><lj-embed id=""15""/></div>
Their Japanese is not at all perfect, and they can't seem to connect with the song that much but it's understandable since they're Korean. :P But for non-native speakers, it ain't too bad. Plus, the song doesn't really showcase how talented they are because they're really, really good performers. I'd go as far as saying that they're better than Arashi as a group in singing and dancing. But then again I first liked Arashi for being their dorky selves rather than their music. XD

You can find Arashi's renditions of the song <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os7DjUZqoZo"">here</a> for their Taipei concert and the first part of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zNT6zom4zA"">this video</a> for their How's It Going? concert. :)"

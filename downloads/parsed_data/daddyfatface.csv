1. Christine is gone. Yeah i know that i am a fag for being totally bummed about this, but you know how i am. My lady is my life, or that's at least how it feels. I miss that girl so much.

2. Summer school. This would be ok if i didn't have 8 o'clocks everyday. It has cut my hang out time in half, and that is the most terrible thing ever. I will change this up later."

Everything is falling where it's supposed to. Kristine continues to rock my panties off... she comes up with something everyday that blows my mind. She's one fly cherry. I really don't know what else to say, which is probably one reason why this journal suxors. oh well. I changed my major to espanol with a minor in Arabic, so i am going to be talking all sorts of random shit if i ever see you around. I will be taking summer school this year so i will be in lubbock probably until the end of the summer... we are going to have some fun, due solely to the fact that every one will be up here this year. owned. that's all...

"event","hey, hey! what da ya say... it's daddyfatfce in the LBK! alrighty, i am done with that. So the reason that your's truly is so giddy... there is a new kiddo that recently started hanging out with us up in L-town, and she is the FUCKING BOMB! She is seriously like top three coolest chicas I know... scratch that... that i have ever met. she fucking likes the distillers just as much as i do, and i have never met anyone who thinks that they are as awesome as i do. So, yours truly might just have a girlfriend some day soon... we're not there yet, but I am definitely working on it... so keep those fucking fingers and toes crossed that God doesn't decide to take a Master-of-the-Universe sized shit on my parade, cuz if he does, i am punching you in the face... yes... YOU. And this cute little number is a dancer.
	Well i had to move out of the garage and into the brownie this week. Why? because girls suck. Both of my roommates are all like,""I need carpet in my room!"" So since i am not a whiny bitch-face, I get the room with the tile. My sis is coming back to the LBK next friday, so that should be AWESOME!!!! that was totally sarcastic... no more smokin the sensi in the house and that sucks. oh well.
	I have some news about the cat... we took her to the vet yesterday to get her shots and they were all like SHE has a dick and a couple of testicles, so SHE is a HE... renamed Mr. El Gato (STYX FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Finding out about this little piece of news was really depressing to me, because i know where all that stuff is and you CANNOT fucking see it, and that sux... if i have a boy pet, he better have some fucking OX balls... or have ones that are visible. I don't think that i am asking too much. anyways thats about all i have, so until the next time i decide to write.

Kwaudry and I and some others were going to go camping in the mountains next week, but i have to freakin' work instead... doesn't that just rule everything in the entire world. I agree. I think that this is the week that i have my ""lady days"", cuz i have been bitchy as hell lately and i have no idea why. anyways, the cat is totally awesome. Her name is Kittie Loaf, or if you are kathryn her name is Pheiffer... but honestly Kittie Loaf is so much more awesome. I have nothing else to write about today so until the next time... go buy a Pet Shop Boys album. Trust me, you'll like it, and if you don't, you shouldn't be my friend anyways."

"event","hey kids, sorry for the no writing thing... i have been kinda busy lately. Anyways... big news on the home front: the kitten is on its way. the gibbinator picked it up and is bringing our little fur ball of awesomeness home. It is black, so obviously i was gonna call it nigger, cuz it would be funny as shit if i went to the front yard and yelled, ""Hey NIGGER!!!! Get back in the damn house."" i find humor in terrible things, i know. There is one problem though... our new roommate who is moving in at the end of august is... well black, so i don't think that she will enjoy that much. So i am thinking that ""CAT-MASTER BLACK"" is a fitting label, cuz our kittie is gonna be tha coolest. Shit, it will probably stay in rotation longer than i do. Anyways... more big news, yours truly nabbed himself a date! i'm gay... i know. Trust me i know. seriously though... this chick is really fucking cool and i asked if she would accompany me to the METALLICA concert in sept, and the hottie said yes. this is an epic day for all... ok, maybe just me. I mowed the yard today, and in the middle of mowing the front, the muffler from my neighbor's mower (which i was using) shot off the side of the mower and flew across the street... I thoroughly enjoyed that. I am looking for a job, so if any of you peoples know of anything in lubbock, let me know... selling dope, and prostitution are not options. sorry ladies... and drug addicts. 


NEWISH MUSIC UPDATE:

just gonna let you kids know what daddy's bumpin' to 24/7:

This band rocks my panties off like none has done in quite a long time, so check them out if you dig Punk Rock.

The Postal Service: <em>Give Up</em>

Really fun and catchy Synth Pop

Soilwork: <em>Natural Born Chaos</em>

Good old fashioned cream-yourself Scandinavian Metal

"event","hey kiddos, it's your daddy coming to you live from the LBK home of the coolest mother fuckers on the damn planet. I've been chillin like a turbo villain(sp?) lately. I have the test after the next sunrise, so keep those digits crossed that God doesn't hate my nigga-ass. So anyways... on to the mooching neighbors. Russel (who is this 13 yr old who lives down my street) asks me for shit like every damn day of the week, whether he needs to use my air pump or he wants $2, or some food, that nigga is always trying to get a damn handout. So, anyways he comes to my house and interrupts my guitar playing and asks me if i can burn him 3 cd's. Now i wouldn't have a problem with this except he doesn't have any cd's to burn and he doesn't have any cd's to burn onto. So i was like, ""what kind of idiot are you?"" and he got mad... but me being the nice kinda homie that i be, i let him look on my comp and pick some songs that he wanted and i burned him a cd, but that is THE LAST TIME DAMNIT!!! Anyways... the TA-IZZLE got back from the motherland today. I talked to her for a while, she seems to have  had a grooder trip, so that's hype... or dope... or whatever you cool kids say these days. It is almost time for me to go j-j-j-j-jogging around the town. It has actually become fun for me to go jogging around this unbeautiful development that i call my hizzle-home. well i have run out of things to say so i guess i will leave you with this, a lyric from the amazing Wyclef Jean: 

Enemies on the borderline. Who'll be the next to fire. 41 shots by Diallo's side. You said he reach, sir, but he didn't have no piece, sir. But now he rest in peace, sir. In the belly of the Beast, sir. You guys are vampires in the middle of the night. Sucking on human blood... is that your appetite?

"event","Good afternoon, I hope all is well in your universe. I had to babysit the kids this moring at 8 a.m. which totally sucked for two reasons: 1. I found out at like 9.30 last night that they needed me to do this for them so it took me until 2.45 a.m. to get my house presentable and 2. the kids were total fucking brats... all three of them. brian threw a-nother one of his hissy fits... I so just wanted to punch him in the brain, but i don't think that his parents or CPS would approve of that... oh well, maybe next time. One funny thing did happen though... they were eating Cappy Crizzle Crunch that they brought over, they also brought over milk from their house... so like halfway through their breakfast brian goes, ""This milk tastes funny."" and i was like, ""Which one did you get out of the fridge."" he had pulled the one out that expired in the middle of may, so they were drinking rancid-ass m-i-l-k. So naturally when i found this out i started laughing uncontrollably, which really pissed off brian. I still thought it was funny though. Well... we have four mour days til the test... fun fun fun. These days I am out in the sun more than most Mexicans. hehehe there's my racist/nationalist joke of the day. The title of this entry is in no way referring to my parents... it's referring to the kid's parents next door. They throw a fucking fit everytime i wont let them ""pour milk out on the floor to see if the cat will drink""... seriously. that is what brian asked me today, and i was like, ""uh, no."" he then proceeded to run out the front door, head over to his house, and lock himself in the closet. I'm not sure what kind of closet has a lock on it but apparently their's does. I got some turbo-stellarific info passed my way last nite, but unfortunately i am not at liberty to discuss the details of the news, but it totally made my night, so kudos to the person who shared. All you stoopers will find out when you get yo asses up here. Time for me to get my booty out on the court, so have a beautiful day today.

I went to bed pretty late last night, but i had a really grood conversation with the kwaudratic formula. It was quite nice. I got invited to the movies tonight with my friend isack at work, but he wants to go see that Riddick movie and my ""shitty-movie"" radar is going off hardcore so i just might not go. anyways... my sister got her atm card for her new account like two weeks ago, and i told her that i would mail it to her in h-tizzle, but i kinda forgoot aboot it, and she was not too happy about that, i tell you what. but i put it in the mail so all should be cake, and pie, and possibly custard, but i don't think i like custard so scratch that... just cake and pie. I think that i am going to go play some b-ball for a while cuz the kiddos keep rap-rap-rapping on my cellar door, but perhaps tis the wind and nothing more. there's your reference to the Poe-Poe. alright b-ball.

"event","I just finished the song that i wrote last nite and i am ecstatic. It is the first song that i have ever completely written from beginning to end. I think it is pretty good, but who knows... Today was going really well until i got bitched out by fucking 15 year old cousin for smoking. I understand that she cares about me and all that, but honestly, what does a 15 yr old girl who has never touched a cigarette know about smoking and why people do it and everything else related to cigarettes. Who knows... I talked to someone today that i have not talked to in a very long time, and i am souprised to say that it was quite nice. I never thought that i would talk to her again, and i am not totally convinced that it is such a good thing that we are talking again, but only time will tell. I found out yesterday that my grandma might have liver disease, and obviously that sux huge pee-pee. So I am probably gonna call her soon to cheer her up since i haven't seen them in almost 2 years. If you are a person who prays add her to the list, and if you're not a praying person then just send good vibes her way... Well it's after nine in the pm and that means that it is celly time, so i will probably update this almost daily for the remainder of the summer since i have nothing else left to do in this God-forsaken shit-hole of a town, so much love.

"event","alright, yet another way for me to waste my time in a superbly emo fashion has arrived. if you know me well, you know that this is the last thing i would support, but i haven't been writing, and this is the easiest way to do it... so welcome. nothing is really happening in the LBK... big souprise. I wrote a song last nite that is actually pretty good, slightly pop-esque, but at this point i couldn't care less. just been chillin at the house alot and playin' b-ball like a tru ghetto supa-star. i started ""working out"" recently for various reasons, health being the most important. you gotta counteract those damn cigarettes. if you are a smoker you suck... we all suck, and we know it. but that is besides the point. I am looking forward to the fall semester, getting to see all of the kids again... _________ i miss you so much. If you feel your name should be there, then it should. We are going to el paso at the end of july, and honestly it's the only damn thing worth looking forward to this summer, besides the visits from the random stooper every now and then again. I've been listening to the flaming lips alot when i play the b-ball outside and i really don't think that Jim-bo enjoys it at all, he is always giving me wierd looks when i go out to play. (for you kiddos that don't know who jim-bo is, he is the 60-something year old carpenter who lives a-cross the pavement from me. he's really cool, but all he listens to is local talk radio and country, which sucks total ass (save willie and cash). I've got my next test coming up in aboot a week and i will keep those who know about it posted, so i guess that's all for today in the life of this bipedal life form.


Much love for the stoopers

"event","im in a weird mood.
and yes, driving down the road at 2:30 in the morning while rocking out to american woman feels good.
im not gonna lie.
so many things to think about. 
what im doing, what i could be doing, what could be done, what i have done, what i didnt do.. etc.
i dont really know what im talking about.
i need a brain organizer
and a different job
even though i made 250 dollars tonight. in eight hours. 
and i wasnt even busy.
i played dice more than anything.
and id like to thank brian for contributing that 16 dollars. definitely helped. haha.
yeah the money is very nice
but a normal job would also be good.
where im not up til 4 every night.
it makes me seem like even more of a crack head than i appear to be.
and the stripper was fired after one night.
theyre a-holes. i dont even see why they wouldve hired her. get her hopes up and then say
ehhh not really. that was shitty. they knew they were gonna get rid of her before they even said yes.
christmas is coming.
i passed subway and that was the first time i actually felt that jolly stab about it.
they had some green lights hanging up. liked em. made me want to eat there even though 
A. im not hungry (eating free pickles all night will slow your appetite)
B. i like quiznos better
i got mad at shane tonight.
he called me and said he was gonna go watch a movie with some friends.
didnt care.
thought about it and realized it was 10 pm. 
when we're together we go to bed at 1030 and i never want to but hes always tired.
im kind of a night owl. 
he doesnt get to go do stuff a lot so i should just keep my mouth shut but cmon now.
he never wants to stay up late when im around. so i said something.
got mad and said i always get mad when he goes out. 
so should u say something when it bothers you or hold it in and act like its all fine and dandy?
i always said say something but then im the f'in bad guy. 
when something annoys you why not say something so u can change it and it wont be a problem in the future.

"event","he calls me girl.
and i fucking hate that kid at the bar. wowza.
its like a fight to get any money out of him whatsoever. he orders a beer, i get it for him...is it on the house? no. man i'm broke. well dont come to a bar and drink then. he tries to make everyone around him feel bad so theyll buy him a beer. last week when i first met him..
""so your boyfriend goes to western? thats far. we should go out sometime since hes so far away. i do have a girlfriend sort of but that doesnt matter. what'll it take to get your number.""
my response: i wouldnt give you my number if i was single.
so he starts bringing his girlfriend in who happens to be one of the fucking nicest girls ever...of course...
who gets a tab and he gets her to pay for a bunch of his drinks when he should be buying her fucking drinks for listening to his obnoxious ass. she needs all the alcohol she can get for the record.
then shes like i dont wanna spend a ton of money...so he reaches in his pocket and takes out a 20. unbelievable.
so tonight he comes in...same deal. then later on his girl gets there and we're all sittin there talking and he wants to play the quarter game...which started the other day and consists of throwing quarters to try and make it in this little cup..the first person to make it gets a free beer...on me. so im fine with that. so hes been throwing coasters all night almost hitting old people and decides to play the quarters. after about 10 tries he makes it and gets in my face and says I MADE IT KISS MY BALLS spitting all the while and probably spreading his gingivitis all over my fucking face. awesome. so i say cool u can have a free beer. he has 2 in front of him that hes bummed off everyone else. he says i dont want a beer i want a shot. thats what u said the other night. if u make it u get a free shot. im gonna win everyone in here a free shot.&nbsp;
eerrrr. i dont think i said that. and then proceeds to tell me he wants a jaeger bomb which is the most expensive shot there is.&nbsp;
my response: do you honestly think i would tell someone id buy them a shot for making a quarter in a cup? especially a 5 dollar shot. ill give u your fucking quarter back before i do that.
he continues to argue with me and then says fuck it. i dont want a fucking beer. i dont want a fucking shot. and crosses his arms in front of him. honestly if he couldve seen himself on tape hed probably puke. ive never wanted to punch someone in the face like i did right then. what a fucking bitch.&nbsp;
my response: whine all u fucking want im not giving you a shot.
so im walking away and i hear him squawking i take the rumpleminze and pour him a shot and as i do i say&nbsp;i hope you know you look like a fucking idiot so enjoy.
he says i dont want it.
my response: thats fine ill pour it out. i really dont give a shit.
i walk away and he storms out. i look back and ofcourse, that piece of shit drank the shot. hes pathetic hahaha.
working three days in a row at a bar sucks the life out of you. people bitching and moaning and wasting their lives away. it was fucking beautiful out tonight and theyre sitting on their asses paying out the ass prices to breathe in second hand smoke and surround themselves with fellow drunks so they feel okay about their lives.
im never going to be a drunk im never going to party all the time im not going to be a beer slut im not going to be with anyone who wants anything to do with that shit. i almost thank god for the parents that i had. i hate drugs and alcohol thanks to them. john sleeping in his car jesse and his friend:? hhahaha goooood stuff.
dont get me wrong...some of the people in there are good. it just blows my mind.
i love being outside and walking and cool nights and eating captain crunch with my cousin and being obnoxious and immature and riding bikes and skating and trying to skateboard in the driveway with the neighborhood kids staring
i like good clean fun. i like people that appreciate good clean fun. most people cant. i appreciate the people who do
ive only met a few in my time.
the book made me jealous and the phone call at 11 pissed me off. i dont like feeling like that. you want to care and when you do it sucks dick. im not where i thought i would be.not that its bad. i am so blessed. i have a job that pays what i need and more. i have good hours jas jared and him. why does the most impatient curious person in the world have to wait and find out what is going to happen. i wonder. too much. i need to stop. its only doing bad."

i saw my mom for the first time in weeks today.
im very much over so many people's bullshit. i am over her bullshit.
college funds? that makes me laugh and gives me a nasty feeling in my back. enjoy.
and i wonder if part of 'growing up' is getting over the things that people do and accepting them for who they are and moving on and not being bitter, etc.&nbsp;
but what if i dont want to? why is it okay for people to be fucking shit when they needed to stand up. and they dont. but then to be an adult im supposed to just shrug her off.
i say fuck that. and i might possibly say fuck that forever. so i might be a fucking child for the rest of my life.
so this is me, nicole mf torres, giving everyone the fucking bird.&nbsp;
ive got a few people i consider family and theyre solid and that works for me.
and ill go to jasmine's kids sporting events and we'll start our own christmas every year and when those people get old and start realizing they want to have the people that matter around them its going to be too late.
way too late. because im afraid its too late now.
and ill probably be the asshole when that happens and i think im okay with that.
CHEERS.

hitting the gator girls day til 800. sorry not at home.&nbsp;
says a lot. and didnt call.
im getting that fucking feeling where all i want to do is pack a fucking back pack full of basics and take the fuck off.

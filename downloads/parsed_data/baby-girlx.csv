"event","Today was okay i guess. I stayed the night at my aunt's last night and she highlighted my hair for me. It looks cute i like it, i regret dying it in the first place but w/e. Now i can't get my natural color back bcuz i hate having roots and plus it take way to long! I'm impatient!!!! I want my hair to get long RITE NOW lol but it won't and i can't wait for it to grow! 

Haley was in a horrible mood today i had to watch her for like an hour so that my aunt could take my gma to the doctor. She drove me nuts! Her and Nathan just like to hear themselves scream and cry i swear lol. So i got to talking w/ my grandma and my aunt about some things that have been going on w/ me lately. They made me feel a lil better about one main situation. They gave me some advice. I'm glad i have them and my mom to talk to about everything that happens in my life.

Everything has been pretty dramatic so far this year and i just want all that to end rite now. It shouldn't be like this. I'm not associating w/ the main person that causes all the problems either. She still does things to try to get to me but i've decided not to let them. If one specific person in this situation truley care like he says he does.. then he'll b rid of her too.

Lol i'm talking to Dezmond rite now and he had to bring up Skate World... I HATE THAT PLACE lol. Some big kid knocked me down when i was in 6th grade and i broke both my wrists.. i don't think i've skated there since. MEANYHEAD! I guess that's all i have to talk about for now...

This is such a CUTE song!!

Come on
And finally the silence,
looking out, looking back across the sky,
Trying to find a meaning,
knowing that I just left it all behind
Still I smell a lingering softness
Where did she go, how did she go, I wanna know
I wanna know that she'll be coming here to me
Come on, without you I'll never feel the love inside
of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on
Thinking back before her,
I never knew the meaning of alone
Still the flag is feeling foreign,
I live the day to escape into a phone
Speaking of a world not real then
where did she go how did she go, I wanna know
I wanna know that she'll be coming here to me
Come on...
She's coming, She's coming here to me, I'm needing,
desiring to kiss her now, I'm living for her,
breathing for her, singing for her fairytale.

Come On -- Ben Jelen :)"

"event","Today was an okay day i guess. I went over to my Grandma's to see my Great Grandma bcuz we haven't had ""grandma day"" in a while lol. It was cool. My aunt and the kids were there for a while, then they left to go to Bill's Aunt Marty's Bday i guess. So then i just chilled w/ my family and then my dad watched the baby so my mother and i could leave to go shopping for a little while. I got a cute shirt for those pictures i have to get taken. Then i got a binder, 2 care bears folders, pens pencils, and highlighting stuff. I left the highlighting stuff at my Grandmas though. I think i'm going to do it tomarrow but i might wait until after i get the pictures done incase they turn out bad or sumthin.

My sister is getting so big. She got her first shots on Wednesday she didn't like that very much. She cried when she saw the doctor lol shes so much like me it's scary. She already weighs 11 lbs and shes 2 months and 4 days old. Shes a cutie though i love her to death! I was talking to Jesse earlier... he made me feel a lil better about everything that's been going on lately. He told me i am one of the strongest girls emotionally and that meant a lot bcuz sometimes i don't feel that way at all. It makes me happy to know he thinks that about me.

I've now realized i'm going to stop looking for love. It will find me. Everytime i start liking somebody it never works out. I also think that may be because i start to like them a little too much too fast. Who knows though. Anywho i guess thats about all i have to say for now... More Later.. maybe"

I can never just be completely happy like i want too. I don't want to have worry about things like this and i don't think i should have too. Whatever though.

Happy Valentine's Day to Everyone!!!

Tonight was okay i guess. Wish i had a special someone to share it w/ tho. I just went to my aunt's w/ Maranda and we babysat so they could go out and have a lil fun. They don't get to do much often so i figured i would be nice! I got money for it so thats cool. Haley and Nathan were okay they fight a lot though. Alyssa was kinda in a bad mood but shes teething so it's understandable!

I guess my family decided we are getting pics taken of all the ""grandkids"" as they put it. So yea that means i have to look at cute N crap lol. I hate pictures!! Last night was kind of fun i hung out w/ Kendra for a few. Then me Maria and Maranda went driving around and crap and we hung out w/ Matt Kevin and Chris. It was ok i guess.

"event","Tonight was sorta fun i guess. I went to church w/ Mea, Kendra, and Danielle. We worked w/ lil kids. 1 kid her name was Alexis.. she was crazy she was running around w/ scissors and crap lol, i was like uhm Stop it! I didn't want to be mean or anything but she wouldn't listen at all. I was like aren't church kids supposed to act better then this Geez O Petez!!

After that we went to the gas station and Kendra was driving in the parking lot type thing and she hit the garbage can lol.. i was like wth! It was funny tho. Then we went back to Maria's and Matt was there but he left w/ Kevin ( i didn't talk to him at all when he was there). So we waited for Mea's mom to get back from the hospital. Then we sung happy birthday and had cake.

I guess 2 of Maria's much older cousins have Alsheimerz or however u spell it.. it's kinda sad! I hope they get better MEA .. Love Ya! Tomarrow i'm supposed to run for soccer w/ Maranda and Sam.. but i doubt we will lol. Whatever man! Okay i'm really bored. I should be doing my History Cheat Sheet but i'm not so it's ok.

Friday Matt's game is in Marine City so i don't think were going to that one. Kinda sucks i wanted to go actually since i don't feel weird around anyone anymore. It's like a 45 minute drive tho. We have to many ppl to take in Maria's lil car for a 45 min. Drive lol. So i guess we aren't going. Whatever it's cool we're probably just going to do something w/ everyone after.

Well i guess thats all i have to say... i'll write more tomarrow."

I woke up this morning at like 5:30 w/ the worst cramps ever i felt like i was gonna throw up! It sucks.. guys are lucky they have it easy. So now i guess Kevin'z not mad at me. W/E i new he would just stop being mad at me. Allthough i don't think i want to talk to him now. He treated me like shit and i can't just forgive him for that easily. W/E who cares. I don't know if i'm going to go to his and Matt's game on Friday we'll see i guess.

I still like Chris... i know it's stupid and i shouldn't but w/e. I'm hiding the feelings and hopefully they'll just GO AWAY! Cuz i don't like them... and i don't want them.. or him for that matter. Wow lol.. thats kinda mean well who cares. Just kind of sick of everything ONCE AGAIN.. well thats all for now.. gotta get ready for church woo hoo.. how fun"

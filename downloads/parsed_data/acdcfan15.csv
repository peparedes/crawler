When you sit and stare out your window wondering if he too is there thinking of you. Its for him when at nights you cry silent tears cause you miss him ... the warmth of his touch and the calmness of his voice that soothes you. Its for him that your heart longs and even when people tell you the worse things in the end you still love him in the hours that pass. Your days go on and all that runs through your head is how much you truly just want to stay forever in his arms and let him love you. Just for one night to feel his heart beat against yours.

<LI><FONT color=#33cc00 size=4>&nbsp; Theres always goign to be a point in life were you start to realize who adn what matters to you. But Its then when everything gets defined and you find out wuts real and whats lie's.

<LI><FONT color=#33cc00 size=4>&nbsp;So now i find myself sitting here alone like a usal feeling. But too the point i jsut dont care. I dont need many friendships i dont need tons of things in this world to make me happy. All i truly need is&nbsp; people who will be there and someone who loves me for me. And i think ive found that . So it may not be much and to many its probaly stupid but to me thats the greatest thing of all is to be able to at least have a small group of people who truly care about me rather then a huge group who could care less. So think and choose wisely on friendships / b.f or g.f's becuase when it comes down to it are they still going to be there through everything or leave you cold?</FONT></LI></UL>

"event","<P><FONT color=#33cc00 size=4>Sometimes i find myself sitting and wondering when my past will be understood. I look apon it quite often even when i should'nt. I know now of how much my happiness erases it but it never completly clears the slate. I wish to let go badly but it never will. The scars remain permant and make my stomach turn in knots when im alone. And you all ask why i fear being alone.... because i fear the things will come back to much and harm me more and i will restart the cycle i was once in. The past is always going to be real the critsim , pain , wounds &amp; mistakes will vaguely live on. But its all due to my own fault for letting them begin in the first place. So one wish i have is that no one ever has to expirence what i have becuase it hurts like hell and effects your everyday life to the worst.</FONT></P>

Its that crazy feeling. The one you get whenever there around. Were all you want be is so perfect just try an impress them. But yet its still the magical moments were it's the first time your in that person arms an the overwhelming sensation you have to never want to let go. The same for when at random times you can just sit there thinking about them and realize you've been smiling the whole time. And every night you would dream about just falling asleep in their arms knowing there's no other place you would want to be. It's the weirdest thing that could ever happen, when you find the right person to fall in [l.o.v.e] with. *Written by me*"

"event","Again, thanks to <lj user=jessycat_techie> who gave me the idea to post my layout overrides =D thanks hun, that way, if you want a layout by me, just take it and change the url site to the site you want you background to be, 
~This only works in S1 style and it works best in generator =D

Just copy and paste this into the overrides section in the S1 style, 

If you don't know how to get the layout the way you want, or whatever, comment <b>here</b>, not on my personal journal, <lj user=apollo629> and tell me what you want, and I'll do my best =D

within the application of a label...

Last night i felt a tremendous sucess as we managed to rekindle what initially caused a handful of people to join together and create a movement(however small it was)and bring a piece of it back for a moment in closing this chapter formally, rather than letting it fade away as seemed the likely case. i almost immediately came to tears when amidst a group hug someone said,""why can't we just be young again?"".there's not one moment in the company of those kids that could be brought up in which i would not instantly have a mental photograph of the entire sequence played out. i remember it all.

This is the youth i tried so hard to consciously catch stride with and felt that i was too late. A couple bands in a basement with a few friends seems trivial in the grand scheme of one's life but in retrospective, it was the be all end all of my existence. these friendships truly moved me. the songs are still endless inspiration. Signs will flash now and again in the thick of the present tense, hinting at how special a moment is but rarely the chance for an overhead view is granted. if something feels so right, document it, love it, and live it.

In no way am i writing a eulogy for my/our youth. if anything i feel more in tune with it because of the past few weeks leading up to last night. all of the passion i felt over those will be enough to keep me in stride with my youth for the rest of my life.

 i am past/present/future proud of of us all, what we've done and what's to come.

"event","what have i lost, what can i find again, does found object have relevance to life as i know living without it. i am being too lineal. inactive physically, but the theory/thought patterns reoccur if only as a basis to construct new space in which creation/destruction takes place. should my cumulative life be taken into account when determining the now? yes and no. can you now smile upon your bits and pieces in aging euphoria? bitter bitter rainbows.some of these presently physical and in theory are still accessible, even though i feel the current relevance of them has tapered off. what exactly is killed off when life's light is redirected? physical? formulaic? historical? influence? surely not denial. these blasts are the keys to the non-lineal life living, and only in rare occurrences blow doors of their hinges. closure is not a collective process."

davey and pop music just work for me. perhaps the strokes without the guilt? cute cute cute

wooden wand and the vanishing voice- gypsy freedom 2xLP
daniel carter plays on this record, as if i didn't like wooden wand enough already. drone-ish folk with a free jazz man pulling it all together

joan of arc- eventually, all at once LP
very quiet, recorded in mike and tim's childhood house, in their bedrooms. live it looked like six homeless dudes jamming. unreal

make believe- of course LP
 most impressive traditional insturmentation i heard this year. extremely tight live as well

das oath - mini LP
incredibly cohesive, song over a minute...not as blindingly fast as the rest of their stuff, which is a good thing

"event","this show is somewhat last minute. two weeks from today actually.
ampere and letters in binary are going to be playing at my house monday may 2nd.

it'll be an early show. bands around 7 or 7:30. i want to have a vegan potluck before the show. that'll be around 6. hell even earlier. we can play basketball too. three bucks- ampere needs gas money, they're on tour!

they showed us such a wonderful time in massachusettes- i want to do the same for them. 

come to cook to see the bands or just hang out. i feel this will be an opportunity to enjoy our nice weather.

my address is 1212 wyandotte royal oak mi 48067. it would be appreciated if you could park on mohawk and walk across the schoolyard. 

let me know if you're going to bring something to eat!"

"event","there is a light release i've yet to find- the beauty shines-at the brink of panic panic panic- a glance is almost unbearable- beauty is an entity i wish to consume on my own- i wander through the moment through the limbs of my friends- my legs are cramps- beauty is to be shared vicariously if the necessary means are there- i'm glaring for emotion for a pinnacle for the city my eyes will feel and feast. <br>
<br>
the existence of every facet- leading me up to this point is seemingly insurmountable- the night and people drive-movement-i am in midst of spiritual existence."

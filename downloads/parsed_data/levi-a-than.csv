"event","And here I thought I would have to undergoing mayor repairs after yesterday.

Apparently, the City is interested in causing trauma to the residents. I'm not sure if that's amusing or not, I feel somewhat apathetic toward the whole mess, even after having my arm ripped off only to have it in tact several hours later. Perhaps it's because I'm not human, or even of flesh. I would imagine flesh-types are having a shaky morning after a day like yesterday.

However... This snow I could become quite contented with. I'm going to play with it - it's my element after all.

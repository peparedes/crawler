"event","as much as i despise the subject of politics, it always returns to the forefront of my thoughts, so i figured id get it out of my system instead of paying attention to my teacher. so i feel like getting it out of my system.

First and most predictably: Iraq
Lately, i've still been seeing many pull out of iraq signs as well as protests over our involvement in iraq. I hate to break it to everyone who is so against us being there right now, but we do have to stay in iraq well past their upcoming elections. The country is still in shambles and there still is a large contingent of insurgents fighting any progress towards building a safe and stable government within a country that we blatantly ruined. Because of the presence of these insurgents, we cannot yet leave. First, we have to aid in the building of a more efficient iraqi police force. When a well trained and complete police force is established, a penal system and judiciary branch needs to be built to determine appropriate punishments for varying crimes within the country. Once this has been fully done, we're ready to pull a large portion of our troops. To finally pull out our troops completely, a large iraqi army must be established with a minimum of 500,000 members. Forced conscription would not be an option, so various incentives would have to be put in place to encourage enlistment. I cannot pretend to know enough about the iraqi people to say what these incentives should be. Once this is done, the government would need to start adding branches to the army as well as creating more law enforcement offices beyond local levels. In order to rebuild Iraq's economy, the oil industry's infrastructure must be rebuilt (one possibility would be to offer up the oil fields for private purchase) and the country must be registered with the world bank to secure loans to fund the government temporarily. The problem with all of this is that this process must be as short as possible to reduce insurgent enlistment while still giving the appropriate police and army forces time to be adequately trained, built, and set up. This process could take a year, two years, or ten, but we cannot pull out until it is done. If we were to pull out now, our international reputation would be ruined.

Secondly: I'm tired of typing so thats it

Since i posted last, not much too important has happened or changed. lets see, summer was drunk with einar as we threw a couple of thoroughly badass parties and got wasted. i finally started to hang out with bill and shelly on a regular basis which is awesome since they're both 2 of the nicest people i have ever met. lorrie is disappeared and melissa is mia as she has been for a full year as of this point. dave, einar and myself have formed a band (either Off the Horizon or The Yellow Rose Band, depending on what day of the week you ask us) and played our first show dec. 18th. It went swimingly considering that it was our first show.many more people than we expected and we all played well. holidays we drunken as usual. Grades for this semester were suprisingly good. Overall, i would characterize this entire year as being so much fun. i've been around mostly good people and mostly devoid of any real drama. although i have been a little lonely as of late, everything as been going well enough for me not to really care anymore. its nice finally being at a good place in my life. with this said of course, something terrible has to happen to fuck it all up, but oh well. i have no resolutions this year beyond one that i care not to reveal and one of just making a good go for it with my band and actually accomplishing something this year musically."

DEF LEPPARD.. lol. he went as far as to encourage the audience to go out and vote this november, criticized california for electing ""the terminator for governor."" it was quite interesting to hear him speak. he never really showed his face throughout the show. The set design and lighting was fucking amazing, absolutely perfect for their vibe. they played quite well musically and everyone sounded phenomenal. my only problem was that i cant emotionally connect with their music. at least, not in a live setting. when you listen to them, what do they make you feel? maybe im too distant from that kind of depressed. during the show, i spent a bit of time with jenn from montclair- one of the only two sorrority girls that i've met that are worth talking to. she's nifty. also, while walking around, i randomly got my ass slapped and promoptly paid a compliment for it by some random girl, lol. after the show i went to cue and brew to see local fuzz play. they were absolutely amazing, definately going in one of my 10 ten favorite shows. they played a kickass rendition of communication breakdown. in the middle of their set, lorrie walked over to me, looked at the cd i picked up of the band on before fuzz and kissed me on the cheek then walked away. not a word spoken between us at all that night. she still looks at me that way i previously described moons ago so i have to wonder whats going on... but then i promptly stop myself because i really just dont want to know. i do and i dont want to have anything to do with her, so blah. i got to chat with bill, shelly, and tom which was quite very nifty. great fucking night!"

1. my grandmother passes from lung cancer
2. phil frank, the guy i blatantly stole melissa from was kia in iraq
3. cori is wed to her girlfriend
4. ian completely spazes out in my room as we watch pi in a not nifty way
5. i find that lorrie is seeing someone else...
6. my sister gets the emo (this is a constantly occuring process for her... see her lj for more)

I suppose its best that it stay there now. Thats all there is to say, really."" for his film that i make an appearance in, or whatever the hell he's having me do. the words finally ring out because i feel them... or at least i felt them at some time or another and didnt know how to express it. but, predictably, now i do... and now i understand how true every word of that is for me now. that is all that there is to say now, and i'll leave it at that"

"event","sorry, i've been going absolutely mental with work and party since spring break ended....

i had a pretty good time on spring break in spite of the fact that i spent most of the nights in varying bars across the state. i really do like the environment down there a lot and just wish it were possible for me to live there. i love everything about the state, its just that i'd miss way to many people to ever seriously consider moving there... i watched 3 movies while i was down there and i'll review each shortly. i also got to swim twice.... YYAAAAAYYYYYY. i also drove down to seven mile bridge to catch a beautiful sunset. predictably enough, no picking up chicks for john. i made a conscious effort to not get to know anyone down there since i was only there for a week. anyways, on to the movies!

Ed Wood- Funnnnny as hell, one of johnny depp's best performances
Secret Window- Overall a good movie. the ending was a bit of a ripoff of psycho and fight club, but it worked. the most memorable part to the movie happened within the first five minutes. johnny depp's character bursted into a hotel room to find his wife sleeping with another man. he runs up to them, looks at them, and screams... the sound a sight of him doing that is unforgetable. it just captures the entire feeling of the situation so perfectly. it was the most explosive cinematic end to a man's mental state that i have ever seen.
house of sand and fog- depressing, but the best acting i have seen in years, jennifer connely is more beautiful every time i see her
dawn of the dead (ok, 4 movies)- awesome... kick ass.... great.... but no 28 days later. i recommend it to anyone capable of turning their brain off for 2 hours, i cant wait to see it again!"

"event","late night on saturday i caught an episode of bill maher's (sp?) show on hbo and saw him interview a woman was a president of some movement in favor of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. a constitutional amendment is required to do so in order to bypass the equal protection clause. they do not which to outright repeal the clause which would destroy any court mandated efforts at protecting civil rights and whatnot, so a specific amendment has to be made to nullify it in this specific case. now that i've gotten all of that crap out of the way.... onwards! this lady made a comparison between the current US and Rome shortly before its fall. She stated that if this issue is left unchecked, it would lead to the fall of the united states as a symbol of its own excessive decadence. this is where the bullshit meter in my brain starts jumping off the known registered levels.

The united states is entering into its most decadent levels in its existence, but it is not a quality shared by all of its residents. The excessive decadence is mostly just enjoyed by a minority of the people in the country. The prevalence of sex in every aspect of our life goes well beyond gay marriage. There are sex shops in every town in the country, lewd images are everywhere you look on television, and anything you can possibly dream up sexually can be found on the internet. morality regarding sex is degrading slowly, but there will be a stopping point and thats something that will take far too long to speak of right now. This decadence would be present even if, by some strange possibility, there were no homosexuals in the entire world.

Now this brings me to my point, the United States will not instantaneously collapse if gay marriage is allowed to continue. It will make a lot of different enemies worldwide amongst religious fundamentalist groups that allready hate us to an extreme. it will not destroy the institution of marriage. it allready has been destroyed by the other previously mentioned aspects of decadence in our lives. marriages can be seen starting and ending within a week on television and the divorce ratio is allready high. gay marriage may push it up a little higher, but not to an extent that wil really matter anyways.

How can we solve this dilemma with two factions that are in such vehement opposition? There is no clear cut solution, but i think one could be worked out. Don't refer to it as marriage. refer to it as what it is anyways... a ""lifelong,"" binding legal and emotional union. pass a law requiring a different licsence to be drawn for these scenarios. keep it separate from marriage but legally recognized in the same manner with the same rights and privelages of a married couple. this probably will not appease the gay community as it will be compared to the old segregatory laws existing prior to the civil rights movements of the 60s. im not sure how to fully appease both sides, but compromise to some extent is going to be required by at least one of the opposing parties and im not sure how well that will sit with them."

"event","well, ortega finally moved in last night, so i have a roommate again, yay! last night was way too much fun. we went to a party that was pretty beat with the exception of one of the most beautiful girls i have ever seen being there..... <insert drool here>. the best part of the night, by far, was when we got back to ian's room and drank there. we were doing this trick where you would hit the top of someone's beer with the bottom of yours and their beer would rediculously foam up. we made such a mess out of ian's room. everything and everyone in it got cover with beer, lol. i dont feel like working today.  peas"

"event","kat posted something rather amusing in her journal today. she posed the question of ""if you had 30 minutes left to live, what would you do? 12 hours?""

if i had 30 minnutes to live, i'd throw darkside of the moon on and skip to time, giving me just enough time to hear it before i went. id either do that or take a tour inside a walmart.... with the nissan sentra! oh yeah, just imagine the looks on everyone's faces as you are crashing through walmarts entranceway at 70 miles an hour with a car powered by a toaster! then id proceed to just run over everything and everyone in sight. walmart is evil, it must pay, nissan sentra style!

if i had 12 hours left to live... depending on my mood (social or antisocial). social: try and see my friends one last time, take a few out for drinks then drive to belmar to await the end. antisocial: fly out to california just to wander around and see it."

"event","2003 was a pretty good year for music, yet disappointing at the same time. here's my sinopsys of the rock world

the good:
the music- the debut album from this band was beyond amazing. i got it in february and still listen to it way too much. i cant wait to hear more from these guys
audioslave- good start for a band that isnt as good as the sum of its parts. these guys could be great or burned out
type o negative- easily one of the best albums of the year imho. they got a much needed kick in the ass and finally got some life injected in their tunes. their best album since october rust. every song on the album kicks a large amount of ass and they even have some songs that would be radio friendly. damn they've got nift
vast (turquiose and crimson)- again, some of the best music i've heard in years
ohgr- when i first listened to this album, i didnt like it with the exception of the first 3 songs. however, now that i've listened to it a good 10 times through, i love it. its like his first album, but with a lot more of a leaning towards his stuff with skinny puppy.
foo fighters- damn, thats all i can say

The Bad:
manson- his new album was very disappointing. maybe its just a period of readjustment for adding tim skold into the band. i hope so.

the ugly
Metallica- worst possible followup to S&m and the new songs it had on it. i liked the direction they  took for those 2 songs and now they've followed it with complete crap. the songs were ass bad, the lyrics sucked, the bass sucked, and the mix was so bad that the engineer should be banished from the business and his studio should be burned down to the ground"

"event","past few days have been crazy as everything has been as of late. i've spent them drinking as usual. i swear im stopping after next monday... thursday, i went back home to see lorrie and ended up getting drunk and crashing there. nothing happened to cause anymore confusion aside from both of u saying that we still had feelings for each other. i miss having her around so much, im such a fool. last night, went to a frat party with ortega and justin. good time. i got shitfaced, lost money, cursed out steve and justin for waking me after i went back to mah room and passed da fuck out. good times as they always are. i finally downloaded the music's entire 1st album along with the new instrumental. those guys seriously have such a bright future ahead of them. after listening to some live recordings, the singer needs to treat his vocal chords better and the rest of the band needs to speed up a little. well, im out to go and get showered before dinner with the rents."

"event","well, i finally told melissa about me and lorrie. went extremely well, and i think she kind of expected it. im glad it went well since i really want to keep her as a friend, too funny to give up so easily.

college feels exactly the same as i left it, but not at all at the same time. i just feel like something's missing now. maybe i've just changed over break a little or maybe its just getting used to being here again. i completely have to readjust myself back into this mindset. i think lorrie snapped me out of it actually. i see everything as though im so old now, slightly disturbing. im not old, but i feel like i am. i hate it, lol. noing me, thatll disappear within the next 2 weeks or so. its damn good to have ortega back though, i missed him. anyways, im going to go to sleep so i can barely wake up for class tomorrow, lol"

i've listened to dark side of the moon 4 times straight in the past 2 days, lol. it helps a lot, i swear. listening to floyd just makes every problem in the world go away for 40 minutes, i love it. they seriously are too great for words.

damn her. she came over 2 hours after i wrote that post yesterday, i really like her alot. i hope it works out, but i know it wont. i miss her alot. i shouldnt let myself, but i do...

"event","ok, this wont be an intelligent post discussing some philosophy or personal theory like i intended, but its something i need to vent on. this past wednesday i met someone at cue and brew. as sad as that may sound, she turned out to be extremely interesting (also, on a side note, rediculously beautiful) so i agreed to meet up with her at the stone pony on friday. i dragged dave and einar out there only to end up leaving them by themselves there (einar drove so its not as big of a deal). This girl's name was lorrie, btw. lorrie and i went to cue for some more alcohol, then she drops a bomb on me... she's 25. ugh, that sucked so much ass. I ended up spending the past 3 days hanging out with and literally sleeping with her (nothing dirty involved, lo siento mi perveted amigos). we discussed the fact that we were both extremely attracted to each other and liked each other alot, but it couldnt work due to age difference. that sucked ass. i really, really liked her. i've actually never had such intense feelings created over such a short amount of time. i honestly cant describe it, it kinda is freaking me out. i literally must've spent 40 hours, if not more,  with her over the weekend (including friday). it makes no sense to me how this happened. but alas, these feeling are for naught and must be quelled for several reasons....
1. age
2. she has access to my old high school hobby for cheap
3. she's paranoid of being hurt
4. i'm paranoid of getting hurt
and....
5. college... this would kill any hope for staying up at college, knowing how i get. especially considering the fact that i do want to leave this town behind.
whats causing the conflict though, is the fact that i have never been so fascinated by someone before. she's one that i'd love to just pick at her brain for hours and try to figure her out. You see, from her appearance, its easy to assume that she's nothing more than ""a pretty face and a great rack"" (quoting her), but from what ive noticed, there's a lot more to her than just looks. also, i've never been so frozen by this look she'd give me. i almost felt like i stopped breathing every time. under normal circumstances, she has these beautiful solid dark brown eyes that can cut glass (its a scorpio thing, im told), but what made the look heartstopping is how much desire she showed in her face. no one has ever looked at me with such intensity or desire. and lastly, it felt like i met an alternate version of myself. like if certain circumstances in my life were different... and so on. lol... anyways, thats the basics of posibly the most intense weekend+ of my life."

"event","We got word this week that the person at the courthouse to whom our paperwork was sent to in order
to schedule our court date has been on a one month long vacation.  Even worse NO one processed
any of that persons work while they were gone - thought it couldn't get worse - but it can 
part of our paperwork was missing when they finally looked at it !!!!   So my hopes for a 
June adoption and baptism are smushed.

This past week President Bush flew in for a speech at the power plant and some political fundraisers.
They shut down the road that my best friend lives on for the motorcade for over 2 hours.  I was
soooo close to pulling ""S"" out of school to go up there, but then decided not to.
Well, Bush had the motorcade pull over in front of my friends  house and gets out and shakes her 7 yr
old sons hand!!!!

So here is a link to a pic of as close as I came, I was only like 5 miles away! ggrrrrrrr

Yesterday I faced one of my fears and took the girls on a long (over 1 hour each way) car drive 
by myself, overall they did fair - but ""C"" was definitely at her limit on the way home.
Biggest problem - got behind 2 accidents on the way.   Question - why does the low fuel sensor
on the car always go off right after you get stuck behind a back up on a toll road with no exits!?!?!?!?"

"event","I will admit I was very anxious about my first Mothers Day.
Holidays are not especially good days for many adopted/ foster kids and being our
'first' I just wasn't sure what to expect.

But it really went well.
On Friday the girls biomom called to talk to ""C"" (the 5 yr old)
she was calling to remind her to make me a Mother's Day card .....awwwwwww

Saturday hubby took the girls shopping and bought my Mother's Day gifts.

Sunday, poor ""C"" was up bright and early (before 6am) - I think to her it was kind of like
Christmas, I don't think she had ever had a really nice to give her mom before.
And she was desperate for me to open my gifts.  Actually I didn't even open it
she opened up the jewelry box for me - it was really cute, the Girls got me
a necklace that says ""Mom"",  Sky also made a card with a very nice poem on it
and hubby out a surprise too - a double heart necklace with 'mom' on the side of it(like in 
the settings)

Unfortunately getting the girls to church was more then a little bit of a trial, 
but we did make it.

In the afternoon I took the girls out to a local park and did a 'photo shot' I am
really proud of the pics, IMHO some of the best we have of them (unfortunately 
'cause they are still foster kids I can't share :-(   YET! )

Other stuff (in no particular order)

I am LOVING digital scrapbooking - their is something so refreshing about being 
able to take a picture, edit it, crop it and scrapook it within such short amount of 
time.  I bought a program from www.scrapbookmax.com   it not only makes digital scrapping 
easy, its cheap (like $30), and even makes slideshows with music, that is what I 
did for the grandmas and it was a big hit (with my mom - hubby's mom doesn't have hers
yet)  Once birthmom gets her computer running I will be able to send her CDs too.

In addition to Star Wars Galaxies I have also caught the Guild Wars bug - I love the 
online play and being able to do it without another monthly fee is just KEWL!

If you read hubbies journal he doesn't hide that he isn't happy with the girls new
therapist, and while it isn't perfect I do see little things getting better.
And I try and keep going back to what my mom first told me when they moved in - work 
on one thing at a time.  Some of the little things that are getting better 
   Dinner this is a new thing we are working on with ""C"" she just loves
      the chance to chat, and would take FOREVER to finish eating as well 
      as get distracted and start waving her fork in the air and such ( I really
      thought I was going to loose an eye a few times)
   Mornings - for awhile these were a terror, every morning, fighting, bickering,
      general distruction and mayhem. ""S"" still has some issues - particularly
      when she switches from a planned outfit to something else and the mean
      Mommy has to say no
   ""C""s tantrums  - For awhile these were really bad, several times a day and
      I was able to track my week by the bruises on my body... she is a very
      strong child . .. Full tantrums by C are now about once every two weeks  
      and don't last nearly as long 
   ""S""s school issues Ok - this is an old improvement - but I am still very pleased
      last year she was on a daily 'contract' with her teacher, standing on 
      her desk, calling out, not able to go on field trips etc.  This year 
      she has done AWESOME not one single call home from the teacher (bad one 
      at least) 
   Shopping with ""S"" this was really bad she would constantly take off on me 
     scared the heck out of me so bad I refused to take her for quite some time
   ""C"" sleeping through the night. when they first came I spent many, many nights
     up 3, 4 and 5 times for several hours.  She is now pretty darn consistent
     with a midnight potty run and back to bed
   ""S"" dealing with playground bullies.  In her old school they old had an actual
     recess once a week, they had 'planned play' instead which didn't really teach
     them how to interact with the other kids
Sure the list of things to work on is loooong, but I know a lot of children living
with their birthparents, who haven't been through anything like ours and the list
I would make for them is a whole lot longer!"

"event","The recent suicide of a former friend turned rival has really brought up so many odd things.

For one it is the youngest death (age 35), other then a cousin who died at age 21 due to life long medical issues, that
I have ever really dealt with. 

It is also probably the first death that has not brought me extreme sadness.   A deep hollowness perhaps for such a great 
waste.

Long lost contacts.  Former close friends that we had lost contact with as we chose different directions in life, have called.

The other thing I notice is that everyone we talk to seems to be in about the same place,  he chose to treat people poorly,
he chose to live a near hermit, obesssive lifestyle

It also brings back so many of the talents this person held, that he chose to remove from our world.  In all honesty how many people are equally as good in the kitchen, as they are developing a intricate props . . .  and I have never found another that I could give my concept for a prop to and work with and have it come out either truly as I had imagined, or better then I had imagined.

The other odd thing is that the reports we have recieved that the family has chosen to have no public memorial, and to post no obituary.
I was torn when first asked if I would attend a memorial (before we knew that wouldn't be an option) because of the ending of our relationship and the most recent status of 'rival'.  I have no desire to be seen as, or to actually be gaining from this horrible loss.  Now on top of being torn about 'belonging' at such a memorial, their is no memorial to offer that kind of closure.

And then their are the friends that we ran with in the same circle. We are blessed to have many that are still in our close circle of friends, but many others chose other directions for their lives.  How to express to those people that we are thinking of them and are willing  to be there for them, when they are the ones that went the other way?

And then in the things that come from a totally different direction ... from a adoption message board...  
referencing a daily devotional book....

January 31,
I am your strength and shield. 
I plan out each day and have it ready for you, long before you arise from bed.
I also provide the strength you need each step of the way. Instead of assessing your energy level and wondering about what's on the road ahead,  concentrate on staying in touch with Me. My Power flows freely into you through our open communication. Refuse to waste energy by worrying, and you will have strengh to spare.

Whenever you start to feel afraid, remember that I am your Shield. But unlike inanimate armor, I am always alert and active. My Presence watches over you continually, protecting you from both known and unknown dangers. Entrust yourself to My watchcare, which is the best security system available. I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go.

"event","Today the girls have 'unofficially'  started using our last name!

Background:
C was totally not happy when she got home from school.  She said she was mad that she couldn't go to court with us last week.  I explained to her that there weren't any kids there and it was just for the grownups.  She said she WANTED to be adopted.  I tried explaining that it takes time, but she was having none of it.  So I called the adoption social worker who will be coming out on Thursday and explained what was going on.  She will be talking to the girls about what will happen, and she also gave us permission for the girls to start using our last name! YEAH!   C did the longest happy dance I have ever seen (more then Christmas!)

I called C's school right away and they sent out a memo to the staff right away!

S's school is a bit harder, but I have asked the teacher if she can start using the name in the classrom at least (she has been very supportive, so I don't think that will be a problem.)

S also told her therapist last night that she just wants the courts to get the adoption done.  So that she can live in her nice home, have nice clothes, nice toys, and lots of love FOREVER!  :-D"

"event","Wow, it is really amazing how time has flown.  Christmas with the girls was a true joy.  The 'most wished for' items, a my size barbie and a Tamagatchi Version 2 were under the tree.  We greeted 2006 very quietly with the girls long tucked into their beds.

In a HUGE Joy  on Thursday morning we went to court and the birthparents relinquished their rights and gave their blessings to our adopting the girls!  We are hoping for a finalization within the next 90 days and their baptism/forever family ceremony soon after!

""S's"" dad was our real 'wild card'  but he was a whole different person coming into court this time, as opposed to October. He came in seeming much more confident and singing what sounded like an old southern hymn.  He told the judge that he really took the letter that ""S"" wrote to the judge in October to heart and did a lot of praying and that he wanted ""S"" to be happy and loved.  On his way out of court he spoke with us and said all he asks is that we love and take care of his baby.  Which we certainly are more then willing to do.

Our concern is focused on ""C's"" mental health.  We were home from court only a short time when we recieved a call from her school that she had been in the 'safe room' (as bad as it sounds - padded room w/ no windows etc) for several hours and they had been unable to to 'deescalate' her.  Chad and I ran out the door (I was prepared to admit her to the hospital) but the switch had been switched back to the easy going child by the time we arrived.   This morning when we tried to get her up for school she went into another full tantrum.  We kept her home, and honestly, I don't think she will be returning.  She won't say why she doesn't want to go but for many reasons we haven't been happy with the school almost since the first day she moved in.  I have a long time family friend who also does foster care and  has offered several times to keep ""C"" while I am working.     I am pushing for a total re-eval of ""C's"" diagnoses with an emphasis on ruling out bi-polar  and finding a way to stabalize her mood.

In a funny, the social workers called us today and said 'since your girls are settled' (yes I knew that line was setting me up!)  Would you like a 4 day old baby boy?  UM NO!  I never wanted a baby to start with, and their is no way you could call these girls 'settled' if you saw their temper tantrums!  Hubby seems shocked that we can get these calls (this isn't the first, and when I called the agency later in the day they asked if I wanted twins!) but foster care is not the way that many people choose to go through adoption. And I have to admit it is a very tough way to do it.  I love our girls to pieces, but  it will be years, if ever before the understand the number of members of their families that tried to split them up and tear what little consistency they have had in their lives apart.   Add to that the lack of family and medical history, and the emotional problems of dealing with foster kids (especially older kids)."

"event","The girls are overall doing very very well.   SOooo many new things are being taken in.  Some recent firsts:
    First Picnic! OMG!
    First (and second and third) fireworks
    First swimming at a home pool
    First swimming at a YMCA
    First trip to Friendlys

We are getting ""S""s wardrobe under control.  All of the pants that she came with were 6-8 inches too long, and all of the dresses were VERY dressy.   Also lack of socks and summer PJS.    My mom totally made the week with two homemade dresses for her!  She wore one for church on Sunday and another for visit with bio-mom today (Bio-mom was MAJORLY impressed)

Ok, well the first visit was suppossed to be last week, but got cancelled at the last minute and rescheduled for today.    The last 24 hours before the visit the girls they were AWFUL!   More whinning, pouting, tantrums, then we had seen the whole time they have been here.   We knew to expect their moods to be off, but UGG!

Well the social worker was to pick us up at 1pm,  at 1:10 we got a call from the office receptionist that she was running late due to another foster child emergency.  So I didn't get to talk w/ the SWs and the county before the visit like I would have liked to because bio-mom was waiting for us.

The girls were in their visit less then 10 minutes when they came out asking me to come in because they wanted help with a craft  - I was talking to a social worker so I told them to go back in- bio mom brought a craft with  her, it was for ages 0-3 simple foam purse you sew together w/ prepunched holes - SHE COULDN""T DO IT WITH THEM!  So they told her I was good at crafts and she sent it with them for us to do together!

""C"" (younger dtr) has basically NO interest in the visit, she has no desire to spend time w/ bio mom, unfortunately social worker and I had to keep sending her back in but when mom went at the tears (see below) I didn't bother, she doesn't need that.

Even ""S"" came to the room I was in when bio mom got upset about trying to schedule REGULAR CONSISTENT visits - they are suppossed to be 1 hour every other week same day, same time, yadda yadda,  she wants them to vary, the girls not to be told when the visits will be and it not to be held against her if she cancels the visits!   ""S""  came in saying 'Mommy L' is crying, I said I know, and asked if she understood why, she said yes and gave me a big hug.  This little 7 yr old gets it SO much more then the stupid social workers and judges.

Bio mom also went into hysterics when social worker called her ""Mommy L"" going on and on about how she is their only Mommy.   Social worker took the blame, in all honesty, the girls asked to call me Mommy and we told them it was their choice.  They want a permantent home, they want the judge to say 'forever' they are sick of being bounced around.  Social worker also explained to her that she is the birth mom and nothing can ever change that. But that the girls need to have a consistent Mom and Dad, place to live, go to school, etc.  Social worker thinks that it is sinking in, we will have to wait and see.

Bio mom is also a bit delusional, she has this theory that she is getting the girls back.  Facts that aren't in her favor
     She is HOMELESS
     She is still in an abusive relationship with ""C""s abuser!
     They have been reunited 2x and it failed
     A third reuniting was in the process and she screwed that up too!
     They have been in the system for 3 years!  (Federal law - though frequently ignored- is 16 months max)
     She thinks she can rent an apartment for under $700/month for the three of them!??!?!?!
     She has never held a job more then 30 days 
     Current job is in NY?  and she gets up at 3:30 am and home at 7pm?  where does that leave the girls?

On the other hand bio mom has informed our social worker that if her rights are terminated she is moving out of the state.  I have to say I think that will be best all around.  We are more then willing to continue contact, give pictures and updates, but it needs to be scheduled (and sober) etc

We did get permission to go to the shore the weekend of the 15th, now I just gotta make sure that our hosts are ok with that LOL!opps!  We did get an invite, I am not just showing up on someones door - but my friend is hard to coordinate things with sometimes.

I forgot to get permission for a hair trim (yes, our STUPID system says I have to have permission to get a haircut!)  They dont' remember their last trim - and they need it BAD!

To my hair assistants - Amy and Nickki! TY! TY!  Bio mom was very impressed that I had learned the twists and had gotten their hair braided.  She admits she does not know how to style their hair.

Our social worker also said that she has never seen a case that has drug on this long not go to TPR (termination of parental rights) and that if she were to testify today she would tell the judge they definitely need to be placed w/ us permanently"

Chad's uncle died last Wednesday.  After a short fight with cancer (short because he ignored symptoms)

We lost Duncan (our youngest cat) early Saturday morning, very very very unexpectedly  Chad found him Friday, basically collapsed in the basement, we rushed him to the vet and apparently he had a severe bladder infection and was spetic.  The vet tried everything they could, but it wasn't enough.

We got a call Saturday from the social worker, because she was on vacation bio mom managed to schedule an evening visit for Tuesday (today) and no one had bothered to notifiy us.  Biomom isn't suppossed to get evening visits, and we are suppossed to get notification, grrrrrrr    We told the girls last night  the youngest just wanted to know that I would be there and she wouldn't be left with biomom, the oldest confided in Chad that she knows she has to deal with this, but is anxious for the judge to say she can live her forever.

Our basement flooded.  The weatherman says we got less then 1/2 inch of water - but someone must have directly our counties portion of that to the basement.  We had problems before, but thought they were corrected, apparently we were wrong.

My cell phone went through the laundry, ok 95% my fault, but still really dang frustrating (I didn't do the laundry myself, so I refuse to take 100% blame)

So God if you are listening today, could you maybe help us out a little?

I now have spreadsheet to keep track of the kids that we are inquiring about, have submitted our homestudy for,etc.  I have heard about women trying to get pregnant and having to take their temperature and such, but I certainly never thought I would need a spreadsheet just to try and get a child into our home.  

I am truly convinced that social workers and our government our definitely part of the problem and not part of the solution to the foster care issues in our country.  We have been submitted for over a month for one child who has not been placed.  The 'official' line from the county is that they are reviewing homestudies.   The 'word on the street' is that because we are not of the child's race the social worker is doing her best not to place the child with us (even though that is against the law).


I was doing some relaxing today, reading a book, a scene in the story really made me think about how books can give us the 'pleasure' of something  that we can't do in the real world.  In this case the main character managed to take a very ackwardly dressed young lady and make some minor modifications to her attire and hair to give her a much better appearance, all during a party - with none of the party attendees being any wiser.   I enjoy the TV shows where they make people over - but soooo many people can be 'improved' upon with such small things that they just aren't aware of.  In  that matter for me the thing I just don't know what to do with is my hair.  It has regressed into what I refer to as my 'mennonite' look, basically one length and BORING, but I have a new hope for some improvement to come to that soon.

I have come to accept that many people who have spent the last few years trying to convince me that they are my (and our  - mine and hubbies) friends, absouletely aren't.  The repeated ""When's the next game gonna be""  is definite proof of that.  Sure it is followed up with ""oh, how is the adoption going""  but they could care less as to how WE actually are, they look at us soley is service providers.  In one way it is nice to know that the 'service' we have provided is appreciated, but the proof that many of these people pretended to be our friends just to have access to that service is none the less quite sickening.   Several years ago the LARP community we were part of at the time faced the unexpected death of a fellow LARPer.  I was shocked and ashamed at the pathetic turn out for the services for this person who was a truly caring person. 

I think I am going to cancel my Sims Online account.  While I enjoyed the socialization of the game, the skill building of it is quite dull and the skill points degrade at an extremely rapid pace."

"event","Well - the tension on one big thing is released - the TV is fixed  TY TY TY TY God

Social workers are a dang odd breed.  One of my friends (who has adopted several times) asked how I was doing the other day and I said ok -but I wasn't having much luck getting the social worker to take action.  She said that someones you have to light a candle under them to get them moving.  I said I was Seriously considering going to South of the Border and buying some fireworks to light.

Maybe the social worker heard me?  Cause we are getting movement today!   Not all good - one girl we were interested in is being placed in a residential treatment facility - so they want to wait a few months to see how she does.  But we got word of two new listings - one RIGHT here in our county,  the other is on the other end of the state - but both look like very good potential fits for us.

Planning ahead with these changes looming has become a serious pain.  Wedding invites, party invites, and weekend scrapbook events need replies and I am just not sure what to do with anymore.  The party invite could be interesting.  It is my cousins party, and none of my extended family knows about the adoption being in the works yet (only my parents and siblings know).  I don't want to steal my cousins spotlight though so I hope if we can hear anything signficant before it is with enough time for me to tell the extended family first.  Telling them kinda has me on pins and needles in general. I have one aunt who doesn't like anything / anyone no matter what - so I don't really care about her.  But one uncle was married and had a child then divorced.  He signed away rights to that child many years ago, but if my calculations are correct she is or will be 18 soon.  He is remarried now and has two more daughters, I don't honestly know if they know about their half sister.

Progress is coming along on mom and dads house, and now that they have a agreement signed on the 'old' house their stress is easing a bit.  I hope to get the bedroom and hallway finished painting today.  Would love to get the living room and dining room primed this weekend, but that is going to depend on the weather (if it rains on sunday then I don't have to paint and can go to the tractor pull)"

But I never expected their would be an adoption version of it ... not sure what to call it yet  maybe ASS   (Adoption Stress Syndrome?)  We are soooo close  but yet the  social workers make it be sooo far away.   I am bordering on the line of harassing them if they would only call us and let us know what was going on it would be SO much easier.

Other news - I am making progress w/ the painting at the parents new house.  I don't do ceilings  - but I have trimmed in 3 for whoever does them, and the sewing room is painted.  Mom is happy,  and that doesn't happen to often so I guess that is good.


The TV  went Whack a ding hoy  last night - hubby was sooooo not happy.  Luckily I got the clerk to give us the extended service agreement, so now we just have to wait for the guy to come out - on tuesday (Anyone who is brave enough to see the withdrawal symptoms hubby will go through stop on by, should be REALLY bad about Saturday)   Research has shown he can be diverted with GOOD fudge and pool playing....

"event","CARROT,EGG,COFFEE-----You will never look at a cup of coffee the same way again.

A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved, a new one arose. 

Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil, without saying a word. In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners.

She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, ""Tell me, what do you see?"" ""Carrots, eggs, and coffee,"" she replied. 

Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard boiled egg. Finally, the mother asked the daughter to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, ""What does it mean, mother?"" 

Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity ... boiling water. Each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior, but after sitting through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water, they had changed the water. 

""Which are you?"" she asked her daughter. ""When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean?"" 

Think of this:

Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength?

Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after a death, a breakup, a financial hardship or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and hardened heart? Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hour is the dankest and trials are their greatest, do you elevate yourself to another level?

How do you handle adversity? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean? May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human and enough hope to make you happy.

The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything, they just make the most of everything that comes along their way. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go forward in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches."

I have an audit appt at 4pm

The social worker is to be here for 6pm

Yes she says she is really coming this time.  But will we get to see what we have been waiting months for - the info on the child that has been sititng in foster care for 3/4 of her life NO!

We were promised that we could see this as soon as we signed off on the homestudy, actually before that we were told we could just stop by the office and see it anytime.  But today, she (social worker)  says no.  We can do that 'later'.

I am really trying to be strong, Chad has sent me about 10 text messages that I have really no answers for.

I called a friend who is going through the same agency, and currently doing foster care for them, she wasn't home.

On top of that, over the weekend a friend who was 'preparing' to get pregnant the same time we were, and had her first last spring, announced over the weekend that she plans to be pregnant again by the end of the year.

Another friend, who had two - just a year and 1 week apart go pregnant while on the IUD.

I am not going into all the women who get pregnant over and over again while living off my tax money.

I will be married 11 years in just 19 days, I have done my best to do things 'right'

and what has doing things 'right' got me?

If you made it this far, thanks for listening,  I am going to go wash my face now and do my best to be strong."

"event","I am Grace Fisher Clark's granddaughter - A woman born in the early 1900's, lived her life on a farm, remembered what a woman was but more then carried her weight.  She shoveled manure right next to the men.  Though she pulled on pants (over her dress) to go to the barn.  She spoke her mind and you always knew where you stood with her.

I am the spititng image of my mother.

When the day is done my daddy's still my biggest fan.

Sometimes I am clueless - It takes me a while to catch things sometimes

I am clumsy - with a VERY odd grace to my falls

But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me, and that's who I am

I am generous -  I will do just about anything for a friend, I will drop what I am doing at a moments notice.

I am obese - moribidly obese would be the techinical term.  I would qualify for the gastric bypass surgery if I wanted, but except in extreme cases I personally don't believe in it.  I was diagnosed last year as being hypothyroid.  This is a condition that I believe was misdiagnosed by the medical community for at least 7 years.  I was treated for depression, told to get more sleep, told to reduce stress in my life.  ETC.  I have taken huge efforts to change my weight, but I am very insistant that they be LIFE changes.  I will not go on a diet for a number of months, loose the weight and then expect things to somehow just stay that way.   I have seen so many around me do that - it just doesn't work.

I am loser - I have done some DUMB things in my life - As Dave Ramsey says - I have paid the stupid tax

I am a winner - I have the greatest husband and friends and family that love me

I am steady - I am strong in my convictions,  I believe in God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, I love the USA and am proud to be an American.  I label myself as a republician, I consider myself pro-choice, but do not believe in abortion as a main form of birth control. I do not believe that our current public assistance system works, nor do I believe in the current social security system. In general I believe that we are each responsible for our own destiny - the government is not responsible for it.

I am unstable - takes a lot for me to admit that one.  But I count on my husband, family and friends.  They are my rock, they are their for me in the good and the bad.

I am young - at least I think so - I am 31, have been married nearly 11 years.

I am able - my father didn't believe in helpless children. Some of what we were taught in a lot of ways was to keep us busy as he ran a lawnmower repair business on the evenings/weekends. To keep the families heads above water.   I have a fair understanding of engines, can sharpen lawn mower blades, change oil, swing a hammer, handle most basic household repairs, and do a damn good job of small cement work jobs.  (As the car that hit my mailbox this winter - the metal is bent to hell but the thing is still solid in the ground).  I consider myself a good cook, I can sew, I can hold my own with a sword or a bow.

It's all a part of me, and that's who I am

"event","Downers:
Water test came back positive for bacteria and Negative for E Coli.  Unfortunately this test is a positive /negative which is just not helpful to my thought process at all.  After many calls and research I was able to find out that we need to install a UV light/filter.  Most expensive 'light' I have ever bought - this one is going to run us about $800 with taxes.

A very good friend stopped in to visit Friday night.  I suspected something was up - cause she is not a late night person and also hates the cold weather.  We had a nice chat and then she cut to the chase, they have done a CAT scan on her mom and now are doing an MRI, early indications are unfortunately kidney cancer.  I really really hate that word!

Good News:
Homestudy itself is done.  Paperwork is being wrapped up.  We are waiting for the child abuse clearance and the criminal clearance as well as the references to be completed.

Fun:
I finally got to attend a SCA dance practice.  I had heard rumours of these practices a couple of years ago, but the timing wasn't right. Recently wildfox gave me the details and this past Friday things worked.  I had a great time.  Next time I will get out of the house a little eariler and hopefully not have a week that has left me just about totally rundown.


To be contemplated:
We got more information on the child we initially noticed on the state listings when we first decided to adopt.  Her story is heartbreaking, starting with the fact that she has been in foster care for 7 years. Additionally some level of sexual abuse.  I hope to be able to get up to the agency to read her full profile this week.

Thoughts:
I was asked to elaborate on my statement that 10 years ago I wouldn't have predicted I would be where I am now.
Well, 10 years ago I was pretty into climbing the corporate ladder.   I was doing my best to take college classes in the evening at Temple and Ursinus.  I was working way more then I should have been, I was thrilled to be wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase.  And the idea of owning and running a LARP had never even crossed my mind."

With the predictions of the heavy snows I ran my errands early this morning and 
got home just as the snow was starting to lay.

And then I pretty much 'hibernated'   Curled up in bed with the three cats,
watched several of my favorite shows on replay TV and napped.

It was awesome!

This evening we got a piece of good news re the adoption.  Nothing that gives 
us a date for a child to be in the home or anything, and I really don't want to 
jinx us. But I have felt that a certain child is meant for us and we got another
indication of that tonight.   

Our final homestudy is this Thursday.  Not too much to do housewise,  Pretty much
just post emergency numbers (911, poison control)  and install the new Smoke Alarm/
Carbon Monoxide Detector (of course one of the three in the house decided not to work
when the social worker was here).

Other things in life . . .
Did a trip out to Pittsburgh Sunday night to Monday for work.  Did the trip with a co-worker
which was nice for two reasons  1) Didn't have to do the drive alone (again)  2) Got 
to chat about goods and bads of job which was nice.  I really enjoy working on my
own and not being in an 'office' environment  but it is good to hear someone else 
has the same issues as me.

Hubby turned 31 yesterday.  Though his b'day went nothing as he had planned we had a 
really nice quiet evening together (which pretty much never happens on a Friday)
I also took some time to reflect.  10 years ago I took him out to Bubee's Brewery
and he had his first 'real' drink.  an Irish Coffee.  If you had told me 10 years
ago what would happen in the next 10 years and what our lives would be like now 
I would have laughed.  But I certainly won't say that I am at all unhappy with 
where we are now.

In sad news.  One of my sisters co-workers/friends died yesterday.  The circumstances
around her death have not been fully revealed - but indications are pointing to murder.
Missy seems to be hanging in pretty well, I gotta say better then I would be if it
were me."

I no longer can drink Coca Cola because it can remove toilet stains.

I no longer drink Pepsi or Dr Pepper since the people who make these products are atheists who refuse to put ""Under God"" on their cans.

I no longer drink anything out of a can because I will get sick from the rat feces and urine.

I no longer use Saran wrap in the microwave because it causes cancer.

I no longer check the coin return on pay phones because I could be pricked with a needle infected with AIDS.

I no longer use cancer-causing deodorants even though I smell like a water buffalo on a hot day.

I no longer go to shopping malls because someone will drug me with a perfume sample and rob me.

I no longer receive packages from UPS or FedEx since they are actually Al Qaeda in disguise.

I no longer shop at Target since they are French and don't support our American troops.

I no longer answer the phone because someone will ask me to dial a stupid number for which I will get the phone bill from hell with calls to Jamaica, Uganda, Singapore, and Uzbekistan.

I no longer eat pre-packaged foods because the estrogens they contain will turn me gay.

I no longer eat KFC because their chickens are actually horrible mutant freaks with no eyes or feathers.

I no longer date the opposite sex because they will take my kidneys and leave me taking a nap in a bathtub full of ice.

Thanks to you, I have learned that God only answers my prayers if I forward an email to seven of my friends and make a wish within five minutes. (Jeeze, the BIBLE did not mention it works that way!)

I no longer have any savings because I gave it to a sick girl who is about to die in the hospital (for the 1,387,258th time).

I no longer have any money at all, but that will change once I receive the $15,000 that Microsoft and AOL are sending me for participating in their special e-mail program.

Yes, I want to thank all of you soooooooo much for looking out for me!

I will now return the favor.

If you don't send this e-mail to at least 1200 people in the next 60 seconds, a large bird with diarrhea will crap on your head at 5:00 pm this afternoon and the fleas of a thousand camels will infest your armpits. I know this will occur because it actually happened to a friend of a friend of a friend's neighbor's cousin, and he's a lawyer."

I thought this was pretty neat, for those who don't know Chad doesn't fly, and I never have. 
So all of my visited states have been by car.  Being not too fond of the cold, and not a skier
I haven't really any desire to get up any further in the New England states.

Chicago has always kind of interested me, not sure what else I have a burning desire to travel
west to go too,  except maybe the mall of america, though I suspect that I won't be that impressed
being that we live so close to King of Prussia.

 .  .   .   .  
The devistation by the Tsunami has me very turned around . . . I guess that is the best way to 
describe it.  I honestly have not watched any of the TV coverage.  I have seen some pictures on the
internet, but I have kept the TV turned off.  I just feel like I can't really do anything real to 
help.  Yes we donate funds, but that just doesn't seem to be enough.

. . . . . . 
Other thoughts, and no this isn't a new years resolution, I don't do those.

I have to find a way to exercise at home.   My membership to Curves is expired, I didn't renew it for two 
reasons  1) I am bored with going in circles, I was great about it for about 14 months, then gradually slacked
off more and more.   2)  It doesn't work with my schedule.  Job changes, life changes and such don't let
me get their on their restrictive hours.    I thought I had hit the jackpot with a posting of a 
nordic track ski machine on freecycle, but I did not get it.  We have the room in the basement
now to have something like that, so I guess I will be keeping my eyes open for more posts, I am 
really hoping for something (or things) that can combine the cardio and strength.
. . . .  . 
Christmas was good, darn good actually.  Chad was slightly under the weather but that is really
the only negative thing I can say.   I am thrilled to have new dishes!!!  I have had the 
same set for 11 years and they were not my style at all.
Christmas Eve service was nice, though we all agree they need different 'special music' for 
next year, the same two people have sung 'Mary did you know' for at least 3-4 years now.
So we have challenged my little brother to show off his musical talents next year and 
bring the church something new."

The holidays seem to be making the adoption more real, at least for me.  Thinking of how the holidays will be different next year.  The fun of decorating for the first time with a child in the house.
My mother in law left a ornament as a gift for the future granddaughter, which I decided was a pretty good idea.  I want her to feel included in the decorating of the tree when we put it up next year.  So now I have my eyes open for ornaments for her.  I did pick up the Hallmark adoption ornament, but I am hoping to find some more.  I also hope my dad ( who is the family maker of ornaments)  will be making some for her.  He is pretty good about those kind of things.

The entertainment center is still in the garage.  I have all of the staining done and took advantage of the brief warm period this afternoon to do some polyurethene.  Weathermen are predicting some more warmth tomorrow and I hope that my work appointment doesn't take longer then it should so that I can do some more work tomorrow.  I have given up my hope of having it done and in the house by Christmas but I am really really hoping for New Years."

Said she didn't have the 'checklist' with her, so she just sat and did the interview (which was what was basically what was in our autobiographies)

Our next scheduled home study visit is Jan 13.

Hubby and are currently in Lancaster for a much needed weekend away.  We went to the PA Renn Faire Dickens show last night.  It was fun, but I wasn't as wowed by it as I was a couple of years ago. Or maybe I am stuck on the Vespers Service that my little brother has been doing at Moravian college - I got to go to that last weekend and it was AWESOME!

Today we toured Cornwall Iron Furnance.  I really found it interesting, I think my dad would really enjoy it, but his knee has been really bothering him so I don't think going up and down the stairs would work very well.

I really want to wrap up my holiday shopping . . . I don't have that many to buy for so it shouldn't be that bad ... right?
 ok... here is how it stands
   SIL - DONE
   Brother Chris - Thought it was done, but the supplier doesn't appear to be coming through :-(  May have to do the last minute Sears gift card thing
   Brother Andy - Done - it's one of those small but pricy things, he needs it, it just isn't much 'fun' to open.  I may pick up some other college student essesentials for him (AKA Food)
   Sister Missy - Done, one item was requested, and the other is just perfect for her 
   Mom - Not Done
   Dad - I have a Fraggle for him, have too snoop to see what Fraggle Rock movies he has and then see if I can get others.  Yes this is an odd gift for a 57ish man but he likes Fraggles, and it will be something for granddaughter to watch at his house
   Hubby - Done, just waiting for items to arrive
   MIL - Done, just waiting for the postal service
   Friends & their kids - this is always a tough one - never know what to buy and such ....."

"event","I am in total awe of what has been accomplished in our home within the past month.

Beyond completing the painting of the dining room and kitchen (which included evil wallpaper removal) we have painted the living room and hallway.
My basement has been stipped of evilness! ! ! ! 
Carpet has been removed!!!!   The previous owner of our house thought that really thick carpet in a basement that can  get a bit humid (and little bit of water) was a good idea ?!?!?!??!
But the evilness is gone!  Some evidence still needs to be removed - mostly the carpet tacks and staples on the stairs.  But Shawn is on the mission.
Then it will be bleached, powerwashed and tiled!
Hubby, Shawn and Ryan are AWESOME!   I had started this task before and got nowhere - they knocked it down and out in under two hours!

""Daughters"" room is dang close to being done - vacum, tidy and hang curtains ( which I finally found - though they are not 'awesome' they will do.

Missy and Amy have the holiday decorating about 80% done :-D

I have about 60% of the staining done on the new entertainment center and coffee table.  I hope to be able to do more work and polyurethane soon.

Homestudy is Wednesday.  Laundry needs to be put away and general sprucing, wipe up needed for that.
I also finally found a local place to test the water ( for the homestudy) cost is only $35 ! :-D"

"event","Our lives seem to be going in a ton of different directions at once

So lets see . . . 
We survived game, I had to call the cops to chase down an unidentified vehicle on the
property, had to wait over 90 minutes for them to arrive so they didn't leave till after
2am

My Mother in law arrived the day after game, yeah that wasn't good planning, but we really 
didn't 'plan' it we kind of got informed.  She is staying here till 12/2.  In some ways
my realtionship with her has improved, in other ways she just really gets on my nerves.
She is rather critical and feels that dishes are to be done within 1/2 hour of the meal being
completed (she was a stay at home mom and hasn't worked in over 45 years!), she is constantly
complaining about how cold it is in PA - I realize FL is warm - but she spent most of her
life in PA.  Plus we have turned the heat up in our home to over 70 ( we normally have it
at 68 when we are awake and in the house, turns down to 63 when we aren't).

Thanksgiving went very well.  Hubby made the turkey in the Turkey Fryer, as always it was 
moist and yummy, several guests were skeptical of the fryer, but I believe they are all
converts now.

On turkey day we also informed hubby's brothers about our adoption plans.  Their reaction
was pretty much shock.  And not espeically suportive.  But that's fine, they haven't been
a part of our lives in any signifcant way for years, so we didn't really expect this to be
any different.   

Today was suppossed to be contractor day at the house.  I have had the worst time getting 
people to come out and do work.  But I managed to find a carpentry contractor and an
electrical contractor that work together that were to come out here today.  Carpentry guy
was to replace the front door and screen door, repair gutters.   Electrican to get some more
outside outlets near the hot tub (so we can have light out there), fix roof exhaust fan,
repair light in garage and hopefully replace light fixture in hallway.
Well last night they called to cancel - ARG!  I scheduled my whole week around them!
Now they are coming Saturday, but my day is still pretty much shot because I have the
furniture delivery guys coming to bring the entertainment center and coffee table this
afternoon.  Which will all need to be stained (in the garage with the light that doesn't 
work right!)

Oh well, guess I better get some real 'work' done and try and make today somewhat productive!"

Not cooking was a DANG good thing!  It's been sooo long since I didn't have a minimum of 50% responsibility for the kitchen.
Food was good too :-D

Problems of game were minimal - we've got a metagamer again - who we gave a MAJOR ingame clue hammer to stop it and still didn't get it.  It will now be handled out of game.

Made it home in one piece I have even managed to move 75% of the luggage / props out of the living room.

Made some major efforts on home improvements today.  Picked out a new 'surround' for the tv (our exisiting 'entertainment center' is two fourth hand dressors that I painted about 5 years ago.  They were free (excluding the cost of paint) and have long since served their time.  The new unit will give us Much more storage and will look much cleaner too.
Also did some cement work on the front steps - I am no mason - but hopefully the job will do.

Props that were ordered via EBAY did arrive - though I never got a single email from the seller :-(  I haven't left a feedback yet - tis a shame since the packaging and item are perfect I just got REALLY nervous waiting to see IF it would come.

- My living room is overrun with game stuff - this has got to be one of my biggest complaints about pre-game- three + chairs have been lost to boffer and props

- For the first time in over 2 years I DON'T HAVE TO COOK THIS GAME   I am almost not sure how to take it after having done it on my own for sooo long it is well .. . . odd

- Work is ok - still trying to get  a real 'schedule' of things some days I work a ton - others I work very little - of course this morning was our end of month and I got sent a TON of stuff - NOTE to self - don't schedule games to conflict with end of month!

- I got a bunch of craft projects done in the past two months - gift projects - won't say more now - cause I don't want to spoil it for a receipent.

- Shopping deals 
     New Denim Jacket for Chad last year they were all $60+    got him one today $18.99
     Got a red wool cape at the thrift store - $6 would work for game - but I am tempted to keep it for personal
     also got a brand new pampered chef bundt stoneware - $2 - dang things are like $30 retail, very pleased.

-Freecycle deal
     Computer monitor for brother at college - his is on the fritz - this one seems quite nice decent size w/ speakers attached

- Started taking a photography class last week, one of those continuing education things.  Covers all manual cameras through digital.  I already learned what the fill flash was for on my digital (filling in shadows on faces when taking pics outdoors)  I hope to give that a try this weekend.

- Chad and I have talked each other into home remodels (he had things on his list I had things on mine) and they are getting scheduled!  I have been picking out the items - looks like we could have some major stuff done by Christmas!

My big focus of life has been the JOB HUNT - Ugg! I have had a bunch of interviews and 2 of them I would really really like to get, another 2 would be pretty darn cool too.  Unfortunately it is an 'employers' market so I am not getting the 'instant gratification' of the jobs hunts that I am used to (don't egg me but I have been offered jobs on the spot several times before when I was job hunting)

I have gotten a few things done around the homes.  Most notably the downstairs guest room is repainted and ready for furniture (which is at my mom's just need to gather the vehicle and people to move)  I am really excited to see it finally come together.  The furniture is a set that I inherited last year - my Great Grandparents bedroom set that was given to them as a wedding gift.  I need to look up a year on that - but my grandfather was born in 1908 so I am guessing this set is probably around 1903-1905 ish.

"event","First, My apologies to anyone in the medical field - My best friend is a nurse - but right now I am just PISSED!

I have been dealing with these dang thyroid tests since June 2003.  I have been pooked, proded, stabbed, and left by the wayside.   The latest fiasco is that I had blood tests on 3/16 (on an ugly snowy sleety day) by Monday 3/22 I still hadn't heard so I called them.  10 AM Nurse says she will check my file and call me back.   3:30 PM - not a word - so I call them back again.  get to talk to a nurse who is a bit more compitant  she says my file says they left me a message.  But can't tell who left a message - and there isn't one at home or at work.    She tells me my last tests show my numbers are really messed up - and I need to see a specialist (I later found out they got these results on 3/18 and the Dr told the nurse I needed the specialist - but apparently the little note in my file is suppossed to suffice for telling me that!)

So - I also knew that the local endrocrinologist is VERY hard to get into - so I advise the nurse that it will be longer then the 6 weeks for my appointment - and the thryroid tests are suppossed to be every 6 weeks - but she seems to think I am WHacked to want to schedule this blood test so the results are ready when I go to the specialist.   I got pissy (quite honestly) so she agreed she would check with the Dr and call me back BEFORE 5pm.   Guess who didn't call?    By this point I had had enough - so I showed up at the office.

Dang receptionist tried to claim she didn't know if the nurse I was dealing with was still there - except this girl must think I am totally vacant - cause she was 5 feet away and I could not only hear her but SEE her.   I told her I would sit and wait for her!

Nurse reamed the receptionist out - even already had the copies of my results for the specialist copied and waiting for me at the front desk - She advised the receptionist that she did indeed need to speak with me.

I did get an apology.  I did get told I was right and needed to have the test.

I also now have the results of my tests (since 1996) in my possesion.  I did a good bit of research on the net with them last night.  Conclusion - they are REALLY REALLY whacked up.

However - I still feel like crap.  There is that list of 25 symptoms which I am dealing with - If I could just pick about 3-4 of them to go away I could handle this sooo much better (among the leaders of frustration - Stomache Upset, brain cloudiness, and depression)

so now I am on 'hold' till May 4 . . . uggg :-("

Big news in my world - I got to go to a LARP that I wasn't Running!  It not only seemed like - but was forever and a year since I was able to be at a LARP and not be in charge.  I got to spend most of the weekend as the ghost of a woman who had spent most of her life as mental patient at Byberry in Philadelphia.  It was a neat role - though  - the patient was also the mother of one of the player ( I was cast)  and that player has been a larping pal of ours for years.  

I did still end up helping out a bit in the kitchen - some were surprised but it was really no biggy for me - there was a job to be done and the person who was in the kitchen needed to get into makeup.  

It was interesting to see a game being run again that wasn't in the medevil sytle - biggest difference in the running was the limited amount of stories that were running - sometimes our Aura unveiled events can run 25+ stories in an event - this game really had about 4-5 stories running.    Also interesting to see the HUGE use of technology - the WHOLE building was wired for sound as well as having the electric routed so that it could all be turned off from the game central area.  Also the whole phone line thing (having one in the 1930's) is one GM issue that we luckily don't have in medevil  - though I guess you could compare it to players contacting their gods just about anytime, anywhere.

Unfortunately we had to rush out Early Sunday because my office Christmas party (which had been delayed due to snow) was the same day.  Just enough time to run home, shower and head back out the door.  We had a very nice time at the party and hubby even conceeded that this party was better then any of his office Christmas parties I had been drug too (though that wasn't hard!)"

"event","Ok - I need a job that pays me to shop for cars - I think I had forgotten how much fun it can be.

Last night my little sister asked me to go shopping for her first 'newer' car with her - she currently owns a 1990 Chev Cavailer (note I didn't say drive 'cause it barely runs)   So off we went - first dealer had a car that certainly met her needs - High end 1999 Ford Taurus Sedan - 4 doors, all the safety features, trunk made for the LARPer (HUGE!) 2 year bumper to bumper warranty.  Price was perfect - came out to about $175 / month - Of course they had to play their games and left us sitting forever and tried to convince her she needed a 'new' car at payments of $250 / month yadda yadda yadda  so we told them to give us a call if they could make the finacing work for this one and off we went to dealer #2

Dealer #2 has a 2001 Chevy Malibu - also 4 door - and pretty darn good sized trunk - not as many bells and whistles and only a 3 month warranty.  But the pricing came in about $160 / month

Well today both dealers have caller her and said that she is approved (with no co-signer - pretty darn good for a 20 yr old single female)  and each one keeps lowering the pricing - I believe the Tarus is down to about $160 now too -   we are waiting to see if the Chevy dealer will toss in the extended warranty.  

It is funny to watch them though - they have tried all the tricks - IE Write a check and we will see if we can get you the credit NOT!, give us your keys (remember her car doesn't run - so we don't have it with it - and were honest with them - we only want to trade her car in to get the tags transferred) - though I don't miss having beg to get the trade in car keys back.   One of the sales guys got really nervous 'cause I didn't sit as they were filling out the paperwork to come up with the numbers - I wasn't trying to make him nervous - but it was now almost 9pm and I sat all day at work in addition to driving around to the dealers and sitting and waiting for the first dealer.  So I walked around the showroom floor - drooled over the $30,000 2004 Monte Carlo (that would be sooo much nice if they took the Jeff Gordon stuff off it) - but kept reminding myself I need a 4 door car and not another 2 door ( I currently own a 1999 Monte Carlo - LOVE IT - best feel of a car I have ever driven - would love it more if the damn thing wasn't a lemon)

Anyhow - my kid sister will be making a approx 10 year improvement in her car situation in less then 24 hours - and I have releaved some stress on the salesmen.  Oh - b4 hubby says anything - these guys were too young to retire ( yes most guys I buy cars from retire soon after!)"

"event","Well we are on week two of non-stop Christmas music at the office - I am starting to accept it - but every once and awhile it pushes my buttons

My little sister has been doing her best to push my buttons too - she moved out of our house and got her own apartment - then held a 'house warming' party - but invited me to the 'adult' party and not to the party that all of our friends were invited to.  And some of those friends were at my home during the 'adult' party - so I had a good excuse not to go.  Then she came over the other night and started whinning about how she 'needs' a faster computer now - and seems to think it is should appear under the Christmas tree to - NOT!

Tonight I am dragging hubby to the mall - he really needs a sports coat for all of those interviews - and my mom says the JCPenney outlet has some great deals

Tomorrow for the big Turkey day I am going to my alma maters football game  - it will be my brother's last high school game playing in the band - hopefully the weather is good.

And our Turkey dinner will be at mom's tomorrow night

Happy Turkey day to all!"

OK other news

Life is pretty dull
I did figure out the Comcast On Demand thingy last night - being able to watch shows on MY schedule is pretty gosh darn cool!

Still being tortured with Christmas music at the office - sounds like it will be that way through Christmas - ugggg

I did get to update my Christmas wish list today,  But I only have 1 gift purchased so I am definitely not ready for the holidays.

The Moore Diversions, Aura Unveiled Holiday cards are being done next week - anyone who doesn't have their snail mailing address on our list and would like to be included please email Chad at cmoore@auralive.com

I have the need to organize - not being able to find things is really really getting to me - but not knowing where to put it all isn't helping - I have an on-line meeting tonight at 10pm - but I really hope to find a way to clean out some of the extras junk laying around.  One of my co-workers has a rule that everytime she buys a new piece of clothing she has to dispose (throw away/ donate) an old piece - that is something I should do 

My little brother is performing with the Army Reserve Band at Ben Franklins grave in Philadelphia this weekend - I have not yet been able to see him perform with the military - and would really like to get to this event.  My mom wants to 'set me up' to drive into the city w/ a friend of hers - I really don't want to go with the friend though ... but looks like I may be cornerd :-("

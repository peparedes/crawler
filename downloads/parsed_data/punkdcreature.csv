"event","at a time i quit writing in here cuz i had my account on blurty.com as punkdjen ... but now im back on here since i fixed my computer... its been 4 months since me and chrysta split and omg its still extremely- hard... i wake up each mornin thinkin bout her and i constantly wonder if she ever thinks of me and if shes ever lookin up at the moon when i am... but  i know shes not because shes def. moved on ... i think all the time and craig mentioned to me how when people get outa relationships that we never stop to think what we did to help it end we just grow to hate the other person and put the blame on them... i started thinkin back to then ... things that people dont know... we were great in the beginnin... and she came down and my 1st mistake was i ran at the airport cuz i was scared of what shed say...then when she left and i cried on the bars of the gate watchen her plane fly away till it was a pin dot in the air i knew i had lost my baby forever... after that i guess we  bagan to drift ... and got our own lives to keep from missin one another or so thats what i think but in the midst of all that this chic lauren i liked well me and her hooked up ... some what and thats when i began to egnor chrystas phone calls and made up reasons to call her back... that was the 2nd mistake... and then i waited to long to go see her after she left here... i went after the 4 days she went w/o talkin to me... and i flew out to AZ tryin to save it and i had a dream b4 i left out a night b4 i got on the plane that... i was standing infront of the house it was during the day time and a chic with short hair came out and i started swingin and screamin whyd u do this to me... and chrysta was yellin because she loved her and ide just found out shed cheated... so i went out to AZ with the fear that dream may happen... and i told her i wouldnt get homesick and i didnt want to let her know the entire time i was out there i missed my dog and my familys more than anything... i just wanted to go home but i was willin to give it all up if she said so cuz i just wanted to make her happy... in the midst of wantin to make her happy i got sad and depressed lookin tryin to hide it and i always laid on the cauch thinkin bout home and what everyone was doin... i always made up some excuse... and then i took it to far ide finally pushed her away ... in one day we woke up didnt touch or kiss or even speak the words i love you to one another... she left ... and it was a horrible way of it all happenin cuz i really liked her mom and i was inlove with her but when it all came down i let myself go... i just wanted to die without her and to this day i still do... i wonder if this will ever pass...in my head its like im over her but everytime i hear somethin or see something that reminds me of her my chest compresses and i jump on the defense... i try to hide it... but i know deep down i know if she was to ever call ide go runnin back... but one problem ill never have that chance... i guess if were meant to be somethin will happen one day... idk! i cant stand the feeling i have now remembering those times... i cry everytime cuz i just wanna hear her voice one more time and hear her say the words i love you... i hate waken up in the mornins and going bout my life without her, it feels so wrong but yet i keep tryin... i do things to take up my time... and i try to talk to girls but apparently i run them off cuz they dont call... i started gettin feelings for this chic names danielle but she doesnt want a relationship with anyone so i dont really say anything bout the crush she knows but i dont say anything... itll probley be a dead end... and me and erin are talkin and stuff and ive always wanted to see where me and her would end up and bn in her arms isnt the smae theres still a part of me missin like every second of my life... its never taken me this long to get over someone or something and i just wonder how much longer... ide most likly move on if i got my stuff back cuz the words dont give it back till your sure your never coming back echoing in my ear drums... so i still have hope but im sure its gona be a dead end like everything else... i ran her away ... and i think back to every relationship ive been in and ive never gained this much wisdom and love and pain outa any of them... im so thankful for the experience of being with her and i love her and i want her to be happy... even if its not with me... as long as she has a smile on her face my whole worlds goin right ... and its just perfect when i knew it was me ... but its not anymore... so ima make do with what i got and thats my first gf i ever had and first actual person not online that i loved ... and ima make this one work by learnin from my mistakes... cuz erins grown and matured so much from back then ... and yet shes still confusing but isnt everyone... i can atleast wake up with an abscent feeling in my chest and smile cuz i knoew ima see her and shell make me smile and while im with her everything disapeers and its great for that moment... shes my white flag on battle day... my glowing brite rainbow lite when its totally darkness surrounding me... and i can trust her not to fill me with lies and cheat on me with a past love... i can actually trust someone now...."

"event","well tonights been very interesting... i wwas haven a pretty nice day until night fall... i was just dancen around fizin up my room cleanin it up... i was gona g o out and go get a job so i could try to help jessy get money to come down but yea once again sumhtin went wrong...this time i didnt do anything... rae fed her some shit bout it was a mistake and i havent even spoke to her bout jessy... i called rae yesterday to make sure she was holdin up with the whole jazz thing... and she or her sis hung up on me and i was just like ok... i dont even reply to raes text... so i dont know why the hell she came up with some shit like that... i may have said that either b4 i went to the hospital or right when i got out... me and jessy werent even talkin and i didnt know what the truth was... i probley should have waited a while to get thaughts strait b4 i decided what the truth was... i finally got all my thaughts straitend out and stuff... i dont know why i was tryin to get rae back... i guess i just didnt want to be alone cuz i am terrified to be alone but im gettin used to it... dont know why im so scared of it... now that rae fed jessy that shit... jessy hates me wont talk to me and i didnt even do anything... ive done nuthin but tell the truth ... i was seriusly gona get on my knees and propose to her... and ive never done that in my life and i was scared to death to do that... now i wont even get the chance... i made a promise i am keeping to not lie to jessy and i havent... i may have said some stuff when we were in a big ass fight and grrr at each other.. but i didnt even know what the hell was goin on... i mean i was just sittin out their on the horse trailor watchen rae play with the horses with thaughts racen so fast... i didnt know what to say... but i had to say sumthin ... i never thaught me and jessy would talk again... i thaught i lost her forever.. and the thaught of that made me break... when she told me that nite all that stuff i thaught i lost her forever and i cut for two nites and it got horrible... i then went to the hospital... and the whole time i didnt think bout my problems i was tryin to make others smile.. im good at it most of the time... at nites i did think... and i cried every nite... i didnt know what to think... i didnt know how i got so bad i had to be put their... i hurt everyone... my parents cuz i never went to them... the one person i let in and know things i thaught i lost her for good... and when i got out i couldnt even think strait... for 2 weeks my thaughts raced... like i dont even know how fast... but it was fast... i didnt know how to feel or what to think... i finally got my thaughts strait... i just all of a sudden stoped talkin to rae and callin her and texten her... im still wondering why she never left me after i was on the phone with jessy when she came back from canada... whyde she stick around if she knew i wasnt over it... when me and jessy started talkin again... the feelings just begin to come back ... i couldnt sit their and try to deni what the hearts feeling... i dont really even know why i said i was over her... i tryd barrien those feelings so deep ide look by them and not dwelllon on everything... i done so much wrong... and i am beginnin to figure out what went on... but no one would belive me... my parents well they know the truth... cuz i told them... i want to tell jessy but noooo someone rae had to fuck that up... i promised my self when i got outa that hospital... ide never lie to anyone... and ive kept that...when i got out tho everyone expected me to just know the truth... and i didnt... i just put myself through hell and i didnt know what the hell to do... i was a little kid blinded by the shadows... i began to get happy again and i  felt like i was on top of the world again... i could smile and say someone loves me truly... but that someone doesnt belive a thing i say anymore because i fucked up... i made a mistake i can never turn back.. ya know i wish i was aladin on ALADIN or however its spelled if i had a geni (however thats spelled to) and i could get three wishes... itde be to take back what i fucked up with jessy... get a lota new cloths... and get a liscens to drive to VA to tell jessy i do care and i havent lied... but sence i cant do that im just fucked... my fucking up in the past just fucked me up in the prescence... thinkin back i guess i better just be glad to know what true love felt like and to know i wont ever have anything like that again... to know i had a good / great future comen for me and true love ... its better to have known the feeling of true love than to have never had it b4... i remember that night i told jessy to look into her cam... and i just looked at her eyes... thats all i wanted to see... and lookin in them for that breif second... i knew she loved me... and that changed everything... i began to lay back... i told rae to look at me when she actually would make eye contact and i knew she didnt love me... and i kinda figured when she said she doesnt love with her heart shes never felt that... but she did with her x cuz she wouldnt hold on if she thaught she loved with her head... not possible... to keep my mind off of jessy and stuff ... and cryin i kinda just uhm yea cleaned my room spotless and shit... i mean like organized the 100 pairs of shoes i have... get everything like pictures from the lap top and music ready... and yea back to cleanin... had a friend from florida call me well she offerd and i talked it over to her and it got me to stop cryin... cuz this time i didnt even do anything... see waht i get for not talkin to someone... but hey least i got a clean ass room thats organized... i also made a very uhm bad phone call to rae and i shouldnt have done that... i seriusly need sumthin i can take anger out on... like get a punchin bag or weights and just work out... ide be really muscular if i done that... i guess now its the end of me and jessy... ill be stuck with my memories and ill just have to smile because of those... least i knew i really loved someone ... i never thaught i could do that... i loved rae but it was nuthin more than a friend ship love... ive never really said i love you to someone and meant i want to be with u forever and shit... i said it that way to one person *caughs jessy caughs* and i told her that ... none of that was a lie... if i could get one more phone call from jessy ide just tell her everything ive got a final answer to thats not gona change... shes bout the only one ide tell... and bob but i think hed bitch slap me... o well i like pain (physicaly) of course i used to cut come on... ima give rae her stuff back and pray i get my board shorts back un hurt... cuz i didnt hurt any of her stuff... didnt affect me that badly... the more of jessy not beliven me got me worse than rae wanting her stuff back... ill have it ready for her on wednesday when she comes... nice and neat ready to hand it over to her... no mean comments... no nuthin... just a nice hand over... it was fun tho the times me and her had... hey least i know theirs someone out their who listens to the same music i do... im not alone ... in that catagory... but it doesnt matter thats in the past in wich intend to forget... and that wont be to hard... i forget a lota shit..i remember what i tell people alot if it sticks with me... ima just write down what i tell people then itde be easier on me.. *sighs* well i guess i need to go take some sleeping pills to settle down my mind... and stuff cuz i keep thinkin how in the hell did i cause this shit tonight to happen ... i didnt even do anything ... see i seem to be the cause of shit i didnt even cause... i didnt do anything and even that stired up sumthin... weird shit man... this world DEFINIATLY works in minsterius ways... but o well i guess.. i still dont plan on dating anyone... im better off alone... for the time being... i gotta give myself some time... to get over jessy if thats even possible... cuz some how shes still got the heart i once did have... cuz well ive never given it to anyone really cept her... since now im happy and im alone... i dont have to worri bout tryin to fuck it up...cuz im not goin to... im not gona push away anything that makes me happy... i done it once and i wont do it again... ill NEVER lie NEVER  cheat AND NEVER SAY I LOVE YOU till i MEAN it... and that probley wont be to anyone for a while... one person i really mean it with..so the others can i guess... uhm blah themselves... ok im goin to bed well soon atleast... jessys gona get the letter tomarrow and yea uhm guess that wont do anygood... i told the truth in that one to... buthey no one belives me when i tell the truth...so i guess im fucked in that catagory but least i know im tellin the truth... i guess thats a good thing i know...lol! yea ok not funny... ok im off and i pray i dont have a dream bout jessy cuz uhm last real one i remember of her... i woke up with this strong feeling inside and it was so strong and it was in the place were the heart is... and i dont know... from that moment on i felt it was meant to be... but if i have those kinda dreams again... ill be happy... i can get the taste of love again from my dreams... so woo woo(sarcasm) so now im off... peace love gronola"

"event","Calling out your name 
Your face is everywhere 
I'm reaching out to you 
To find that you're not there 
I wake up every night 
To see the state I'm in 
It's like an endless fight 
I never seem to win 

I can't go on as long as I believe 
Can't let go when I keep wondering 

Chorus:
Where are you now, what have you found 
Where is your heart, when I'm not around 
Where are you now, you gotta let me know 
Oh baby, so I can let you go 

I can hear your voice 
The ring of yesterday 
It seems so close to me 
But yet so far away 
I should let it out 
To save what's left of me 
And close the doors of doubt 
Revive my dignity 

Bit, I can't go on as long as I believe 
Can't let go when I keep wondering 

Chorus 

I should let it out, it's time to let you go 
Oh baby, I just want to know

looking into your borwn eyes is just like drowning into sweet chocolate,
when i hold u and feel your heart beati wish i time would pause so we can live in this moment forever,
when you call my name it sounds like a sweet angel calling to me,
when you kiss me i grow weak in the knees and i grow tender,
when we are next to one another i can smell all the love in room,
i pray at night it can forever stay this way.

im here, im back
i face my fears that always brings me tears
ive had to let go of the ones that once meant something
i have to face the worst thing ive done. uncover the sun in the darkness i stood
i have to let go of the past , and make my happiness last
my wishes changed, my bad dreams have fadded
what ive always dreams of in a girl was right in my face, i was to blind to see
can she forgive me for the wrong i done, so maybe  love can take its flight... 
the days of me thinking of how to say my goodbyes are over
meaning im not gona die...
(next poem)

i am sittin here looking out a window at the rain
thinking of why i was put here, how could i let it get this far
how i done everyone so wrong, i said things that didnt belong
ive always believed in peace, but i caused a pain that wont cease
locked inside, looking out, i found my time to powt
realeasing my tears as i talked to my peers
i got the pain out that i built up and i could tell what  my heart was feeling
i hurt an innocent girl inwich i care for very much
i caused her a pain,but i feel like i beat my self with a cane
i realized at 1am that i really did love her
i let go of the past, i took my fathers advice, i got my act 2gether
my world now i want it to be just me and rae
some days maybe my heart can be hers for all the days"

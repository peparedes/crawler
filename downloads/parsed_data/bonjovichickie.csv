"event","These are the days I miss having friends around.  These are the days when my heart is in lost and found.  These are the days when ""I understand"" sounds so sweet.  These are the days where I need someone by my seat.  These are the days that are so hard to stand.  These are the days I need someone to hold my hand.  These are the days life seems so hard.  These are the days I have to be on guard.  These are the days I feel I cant hold on.  These are the days I wanna run away and be gone.  These are the days where I need someone to come my way.  These are the days when I realize I pushed them all away.  These are the days I need to talk.  These are the days I need to walk.  These are the days I need to clear my head.  These are the days I sincerely dread.  These are the days when life I cant live.  These are the days where I have nothing left to give.  These are the days when I miss him more.  These are the days I realize what the breakup was for. These are the days when everything goes wrong.  These are the days I try to play along.  These are the days where nothing makes sense.  These are the days I tackle both sides of the fence.  These are the days when right and wrong are the same.  These are the days I have no one to blame.  These are the days when I feel like a pawn. These are the days when life continues on.  These are the days when people make amends.  These are the days when grudges need to end.  These are the days where forgiveness is key.  These are the days to get on one's knee.  These are the days when God is in control.  These are the days where He pulls you out of the hole.  These are the days when prayer works the best.  These are the days when God takes care of the rest."

"event","Let me set the scene for you:  St Pete Times Forum. Huge Gaps between the seats.  Warning Signs everywhere. The aroma of weed in the air.  And KaBoom.  Nickelback hits the stage. It was a pretty awesome concert.  Trapt was pretty good.  Cheville I was not impressed with, although Weikels and I had quite the convo about them last nite, maybe its just cuz I am not a fan.  I dunno.  Too loud for me.  Nickelback was awesome.  Lots and Lots of pyro and cheap pops :P) I think we counted 999,997 of them.  Ok, so it was more like 19.  Oh and Trapt has a guitarist who looks like Napoleon Dynamite and when he jumps up and down it looks like he has bunny ears flopping, and he got lost on stage a few times lol.  Trapt and Cheville lead singers are short.  Nickelback's lead singer looked hott in his jeans.  But he is too old, like someone else I know.... hehe.  No one on here though.  Anywho so it was pretty awesome.  Oh, and we were in the hoyty toyty section, where ppl stand in the elevators and are paid to be button pushers. Very spiffy.

Now I am sitting in my room probably all day, even though it is absolutely gorgeous outside.  I think I will get some of my homework out of the way, since I have nothing better to do.  hint hint.  HeHe."

"event","HURRAH!!!!!!!!!! TODAY I AM GOING TO THE NICKLEBACK CONCERT WITH LENNY LEONARD AND I COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED!!!!!!!!!

On a more paranoid note, yesterday I heard my keys jingle from my door at 1:30am, yes I left my keys in my room door.  I was trying to sleep and my 1st thought was, oh its just Jon coming in.  Well, JOn doesnt have my keys for the front door, and no one else was home.  So, naturally I am officially scared for my life.  Then, I kept hearing footsteps, weird noises, possible conversation, and was freaked out.  So, I called Weikels who told me to look for the security phone number, which was in the kitchen.  He told me to look online, but I was too freaked out to move.  So, then I called Jon, who came over at about 3:00am, and there was no one in my apartment.  He stayed over til 7:30 this morning bc he had to have his car in the shop by 9am so he could leave to go to the airport then to Ft Myers with his friends for spring break.  What a freaky nite.  So when Jon got up this morning I was hacking up a lung, so I took my hydrocodone cough syrup at about 7:30am.  I fell asleep and did not wake up until 1pm.  I feel like I just got hit by a truck sleeping so late.  Hopefully it will help me get rid of this sinus infection I have been battling for 2 weeks now.  Anywho, that is my story about my paranoia. 

Oh, did I mention I am ecstactic to go to see Nickleback?!!!!!!!"

The doctor didnt see me until one hour after my appt time, which was 15 minutes before they closed.  She did not spend more than 2 secs looking at my throat and handing me out meds.  Well, bc she didnt take the time to listen to what I had to tell her, the meds are not working, and I am still sick, and still have a fever 4 days into the meds.  Stupid doctors.

Oh, have I mentioned how much I dislike needy, insecure, pathetic guys who fall in love with me like within hours of meeting me.  Why do these guys always seem to find me?  Why can't I ever get rid of them?  And why is I am not ready to date never enough?  This dude, after I told him I wasnt over my recent ex, when in reality, he is 100% not my type in every way, messaged me the next day saying You need to get over your ex, bc I think you have to tie up some loose ends, and it seems like you will never go out with me.  WTHeck?!   The next flippin day.  Ok, Ill get right on it.  LOL.  The point is for me to never go out with him, why don't guys get that?  Why are they so flippin obsessed all the darn time.  I dont like them, theyre not my type, theyre soooooooooo insecure and I just dont need that stuff right now.

Oh and if he reads this, that just shows how obsessed he is.  Checking up on me and stuff."

He has been helping me out immensly since my wonderful injury and I cannot thank him enough for it.  On another note, my foot is totally killing me today.  Oh Jon stole a wheelchair from USAVE for me since my crutches hurt my non existant ab muscles... I made him take it back lol.  All I need is to get arrested for being a gimp in a stolen wheelchair.  Anywho, so my rents came up yesterday and stayed for like 12 hours.  My dad hit my foot accidently, which sent unbelievable (well it was believable to me) pain into my foot.  So naturally I am screaming, and he says, that shouldnt have hurt it is healing, and to basically stop overreacting... well now the pain is so intense I am like silently crying... thank goodness no one noticed... but how insensitive.  I think this foot will never heal.  On another note, I took a shower in the shower today... very difficult... I think I will continue to use the sink.  Stupid table.  I saw Bambi 2 and Walk the Line.... bambi 2 was cute, 1 hr, but kinda dumb... I only watched it for flower... he farts and flowers die... too funny.  Walk the line was alright, a little slow, and ended once he got his wife.  It was like watching 2 hrs for the ending but you knew how it ends, it ends so early in his life, then of course the rest was written text.  lol.  So that is all for now..., byes"

Lesson learned: never stand on a glass table to put up bon jovi posters.....

Good news: there was only one piece of glass in my 1.5inch wound, and 3 stitches so it oozes

Bad news: the student did use enough lanacaid (anesthetic) when he was stiching so it hurt like a mo fo.  that and some of the nurses treated me like i was 9 yrs old w/ lots of lessons n lectures

"event","Alright,

In one hour I would have successfully made it 24 hours without crying my little eyes out over this stupid breakup issue.  Well, actually, that isn't true... I started at 9pm last night, didnt finish until about, oh say, 10-11pm.  Ok, so 1-3 hours.  I am determined to make it.  Yesterday I missed it by 60 minutes.  What can I say, my heart is broken.

But enough of this stupid sentimental girly shit nonsense.  I am so tired of feeling awful for fucking up 2 relationships, although the 1st one wasnt really my fault, but that depends on who you ask and what rumors and perceptions and shitty ideas about me you want to believe.  Bitch or no bitch, I am still tired.  I refuse to feel horrible any longer.  Everything is said and done and I am moving on.

I am thru being dependent on stupid fucking boyfriends, and thru with neglecting the friends that truly matter.  Now, while I am cursing, which is my right to do by the way, I must say the ex and I are trying to be friends.  Just friends.  Now for those of you who know me, which is about 2 people, you will know how incredibly physical of a person I can be, ah hell I am.  And for those of you who don't, well then you missed out on some incredible drama related to the physicality and sexuality of relationships. And by sexuality, I do not mean intercourse, however, the things I have done, and the way I feel about them, and the way stupid Jerome Hendrix feels about them, (sorry I am still bitter for you giving me that rotten peutrid advice at 1am after well you know what happened), it may have well been.

Anywho I digress, no more kissing the ex bf, no more wishing I was with him, no more eating to keep from crying (I think in about 2 more days I will officially be a hot air balloon), no more crying over who the hell knows what, no more bull shit.  I am going to concentrate on myself.  I am going to move on to well, I am not going to move on to new boys.

I am going to change from this moment forward, no more feeling like I have to do something in order to please the other person, no more doing physical things past what I am comfortable with (thus meaning w/e I can do and not cry for 4 hours after is sufficient), no more flirting, no more boys.  Nothing.  I am finished.

I do not need a boyfriend.  I do not want a boyfriend.  I am not experimenting with another lifestyle in case you all were stupid and close-minded enough to assume so.  I am not looking for a fuck-buddy, or an almost fuck-buddy.  I am finished.  I just need to be by myself so I can work out my shit.  And believe me there is sooo much shit to work out, ask Jerome or the ex's or Weikels.  

I love Weikels, I mean that guy has just been there for me, and boy was he there when all the shit hit the fan with almost every guy that meant anything. Not to mention I do not think I have ever cried on the phone to anyone more than him.  And by cry I mean cry to the point where no words come out of the mouth... just pure bawling.  And by more than anyone I mean 3x now.  Matt, that stupid fucker, the 1st time Jon said he was leaving me, and this breakup. Oh and speaking of meaning something, I have let go of a guy finally, who I have come to realize meant nothing to me, but contributed to the many issues I have with the male gender.  

Oh and I love Jerome too, even though sometimes I think his gf doesnt like me, but then again that is just me being paranoid and could potentially lead to fucking up a good friendship.  So I am done thinking your gf hates me.  And even though I am still a bit bitter of that ""advice"" you still are an awesome friend.

And I could not forget the man who rox my sox, and the only person who still talks to me, besides Jerome, in that little circle of well I will be nice and just bite my tongue and say ""people"".  But Jerome was there before I met any of you ""people"" and I was there before he even knew any of you. And look, he still talks to me, could it be because he isnt judgmental and didnt listen to just one side of a fucking story... hmmm... maybe, maybe not. Just remember that.

I digress, Lenny Leonard is by far the coolest one of the ""people"" around.  I cannot believe that this guy listens to the shit that comes out of my mouth.  How immature it must sound.  Well, I have grown up yet again.

I do not need a man to be happy, and I refuse to believe that the people who do not care about me matter in my life.  I also refuse to listen to anyone's opinions other than my own.  My own opinions are the only ones that matter in my life... why you may ask... bc in the end... when all is said and done... i have to answer to myself (and God, but He cannot really express His opinion directly).... I have to be ok with the decisions I make.... so why would I listen to someone else and fuck it all up... when I can listen to myself, fuck it up, and only have myself to blame for not being wiser, move on, and go from there.  Listening to other ppl makes you regret them and yourself for listening to them when things go wrong... making wrong decisions means you cut the blame in 1/2... blame yourself only, and move on.

Well my brain hurts... oh and no more cursing after 12am tonite.  I just had to get it all out of my system.... it will be back to butt, flippin, snap, and w/e other clean words I can come up with.

I am done."

We have been through so much, and I care about him too much just to kick him out of my life.  This whole friends thing is just so hard, but I am determined to stick with it... seeing as how I can't really stick with anything else except for school.  I am such an impulsive neurotic psychotic mess who has no direction and no idea what she wants to do with her life.  Not to mention I just dropped 4,046.76 on my semester just for tuition, and you know how you appreciate things more when you pay for them... well I hardly think that the education I am supposed to be receivign is worth half that.  I swear I could teach myself this stuff and most of it is common sense.  Everything I am learning I am learning in my internship... which I absolutely love to death... and not bc all the boys hit on me, tell me tyhey love me, how pretty I am, and want me to go to hawaii with them lol.  Oh did I tell ya'll one of my clients asked me how my weinie was the other day??? I told him I didnt have one, and he walked away... what a trip... they are an amazing group of people... anywho I am done typing my hands hurt and I still have 2 papers left to do... cya

It is not like I can go poof and change things... although I did do that with my flirting for a certain person and I cannot believe I let him coerce me like that.  Anywho, last nite, well Monday nite Jon, yes the ex, stayed over on my floor, yes really on the floor, bc his rear differential broke on his car and it will cost about $1,000 to fix it and no one could take him to school, so he took the shuttle at my place.  Yes, I know, bad idea, trust me, Hendrix knows all about it.  Well Tuesday afternoon he comes back from class, says he had a bad day... then goes into this sad state of us breaking up.  Saying how he doesnt think it is mutual judging by something I wrote in some notebook, and he thinks I didnt want to break up with him.  On the contrary, I was the one who started the convo and I swear ex bfs and gfs cant be friends due to this reason.  He always apologizes for us breaking up, says he wants to still be with me, that he loves me, but says our relationship needed a lot of work, and a lot of work could not be done on it while we were together.  Of course, ya'll know me, and I am like well I aint waiting years to see if this works out, I want to be able to date other people (bc that apparently goes soooooo well for me).  Well, this crushed him, but he agreed.  Then somehow during a conversation made me feel real guilty about this and my words got all twisted and I ended up saying I would work on our rel. but if something comes along and after serious thinking about it I wouldnt pass it up just bc.  Well, anywho, my point is that yesterday afternoon I didnt talk to him the whole way taking him home or all night, or even right now as he just called me.  Thus, proving that ex's can't go back to being friends bc old habits are still there, and old feelings and desires are still there too.  That is my rant."

"event","This morning I woke up with blue and purple all around my eyes from crying so much last night.  Jon and I mutually broke up... the relationship, while we loved each other, was just not stable enough for both of us anymore.  We rushed into our relationship due to the extenuating circumstances, which some of you know about, and it kinda faded out ever since.  We just weren't happy with it anymore.  And while I say it was mutual don't think it doesn't hurt me any less.  Now we are going to try to be friends, and see if we can still do that, bc neither one of us wants the other out of their life.  


To those of you who would have the odasity to even think the following: that is not a good idea, or I told you so, or you were better off with the last bf, let me rant about a few things....

1st of all thank you to all those who were there for me last night.

2nd of all thank you to all those who haven't been there for me for over a year now.  You have taught me how valuable TRUE friends are, and that none of you were my True friends.  In fact, I don't believe any of you were my friends in the first place, with exception to maybe one, but even him I haven't spoken to in over a year now.  

3rd of all you people who think I was better off with the last boyfriend, do not know anything about me, anything about this or that relationship, nor did you want to take the time to know anything about either one.  So for you to make such a judgment statement is ridiculous based on those circumstances alone.  Not to mention not talking to me for over a year, and some even longer, making sure I knew I was not wanted, making sure I knew that you did not want anything to do with me... I thank you for that bc it makes this a heck of a lot easier to say.... I am so glad none of you are in my life anymore, so I don't have to put up with the constant fakeness and judgmental attitudes you all had to offer."

"event","So the other day I made a frozen turkey breast, some canned veggies, and cornbread w/ sliced apples in it... surprisingly none of it was burnt or undercooked ;) not to mention it tastes 1/2 way decent too....

... on a different note my bf of 4 months (officially not technically... technically its 5) bought me flowers and a cutesy card for our ""anniversary""... how romantic is that. oh and b4 you say... i thought you hated flowers... i do... typical flowers... these r atypical... however they still smell like flowers... very strongly... which i dont like... but hey beggars cant be choosers ;)

speaking of which... after spending 2 hrs in my car driving from TWS to Falkenberg Jail to TPD to home... I came across a man sitting beside the road at Cass and 275 (downtown)... he had a sign tht said he was hungry... I had gotten some ones from TPD after paying 3$ for my bckgrnd check... and stuck one out of the window... the man walked over andn very excitedly was like ""how are you doing young lady""  I said I was fine.. asked him how he was and he said fine also.  Then he stated ""most people roll their windows up, not down."" I smiled then said here you go have a nice day.  

It is sad that when we (society) typically speaking sees people who are unfortunate, or pretending to be unfortunate, they roll up their window... as if the PERSON is going to harm them or steal their car.  Granted, I do this too when I feel uncomfortable or am unfamiliar of my surroundings... I just thought it was sad...

Given this scenario: it must have taken quite a bit of courage to swallow someone's pride and sit with a sign asking for food or money... whether or not they are indeed hungry or just wanna make money is not the point... either way people yell obscene things at them, throw things at them, ignore them completely, roll their windows up, are afraid of them, and just simply pretend that they do not exist.  I just think it is sad when people pretend or wish other PEOPLE do not exist.  Everyone is a person with feelings, no matter what they have done, or how horrible their past has been... it still makes them a person, and as a person they should be treated with the same respect as everyone else.

That is my rant for the day."

I totally figure its some old wrestler I have only heard of in conversation with Jerome, who btw I havent heard from since my birthday.  Then, come to find out, it was Eddie Guerrero. How totally wrong is that?! Apparently like everyone else has stated, he was found dead in his hotel room.  Who just ups and dies, I would think that would be the hardest for the family to deal with.  How totally random.  

I dunno what happened to Weikels.  I think he disappeared or something.  He hasnt returned any of my phone calls, nor have I heard from him since my birthday as well.

However, I did have a hurricane finally 2 weekends ago.  It was the most glorious drink ever.

"event","Ok... so this morning about 10am I was awaken by the door knocker.  I opened the door to find a fully dressed, muscular police officer.  Needless to say, he was very intimidating.  He was asking me questions about the apt across from us.  Apparently some stuff got stolen from there over the weekend.  I told him that I didnt see anything, and he took down all my info.  Well, after he left, I called Jon bc I was all distraught, and realized that I remembered seeing the door wide open over the weekend, for a few minutes.  Probably nothing, but you never know.  It seemed odd, bc it looked like no one was home during this time.  So, I called the police dept, and told them that some cop came by and I wanted to add something to the police report.  They said they were going to send the cop by again to come talk to me.  The cop is here now, so I am gonna answer the door.

Ok, so the cop came by and I told him I saw the door open.  Apparently no one was in that apt all weekend, so the door being open would be very odd.  I hope it was on Friday that I saw the door open... I remember bc Jon came over too.  Oh well, I signed the thing saying that it was true... hopefully it meant true to the best of my knowledge.  I dunno.  But now my conscience is cleared. 

The only thing I am thinking is that they didnt lock their door.  Bc I was here all last week, and this weekend, and nothing happened.  I was gone for bits at a time, but our door was always locked.  Makes me wonder... also.. I wonder if they locked their room doors too, or if the ppl got into the apt and into their rooms.  Very encouraging lol.

Oh, too funny, Stacy wakes up this morning, walks down the hallway only to see this big massive cop standing in our kitchen. lol.  Poor girl.  Stacy is the 4th roommate that no one knows.  She seems pretty cool, a little quiet, but pretty cool.

"event","I hate drama.  Why does drama follow me everywhere I go?  Why is it that I care more about everyone else in this stupid world more than myself?  Why don't I care if I am happy?  Why is it that I want everyone else to be happy even if it is at the expense of my own happiness?  And why is it when I do think of myself after considering everyone else everything hits the fan and goes incredibly horrible?  Why does it feel like I shall never be happy because the choices I need to make to be happy will hurt someone in the end?  Why is it that I can make myself care for someone one day, and the next be totally apathetic towards them and not care?  Why can I take my feelings out of the equation if it means it is best for everyone?  Why is it I feel that my feelings and thoughts dont matter because all that matters is everyone else's?  Why is it when something bad happens to someone, I am the first one there to try to make it all better?  Why is it that I can be very outgoing at times and then shut down the minute things get uncomfortable?  Why do I push people away before they get to know me?  Why dont I fully trust anyone?  Why do I feel like if my feelings were to ever be involved I would get seriously burned beyond measure?  How is it that I can totally detach my feelings from a person or situation when things get messy? Why is it that I want to change myself, but feel like I cannot?  Why is it that people hurt me or screw me over incredibly bad, but yet I am always still there for them? Why is it that I feel even this journal entry is going to cause confusion and end up hurting someone?  Why do I feel I cannot do a single thing w/o it being blown out of proportion?  Why is it that guys fall in love w/ me one week w/in meeting me, and take it soooo hard when I just want to be friends?  How is it that one morning I can fully trust a friend, but then by the afternoon I dont trust them as much?  Why is it easier to not be friends w/ people, than to put up w/ all the drama that comes along w/ it?  Why am I so scared about hurting other people? Why does my conscience always get the better of me?  Why do I follow the logic and whats better for everyone rather than my heart? Why is it that I dont even fully trust the friends I have had for 3 years? 

All I want in life is to be a good person; never hurt anyone, always do what's right, be nice to everyone, help everyone I can, be open-minded and open to talk to, and just be there for anyone and everyone.  But in reality that leaves no ""me time,"" and I am perfectly all right w/ that... but apparently, according to many people, I have to start thinking about myself instead of others. I am not supposed to care about others' when it comes to feeling a certain way about a situation, just my feelings. So here is the main question... How am I supposed to think of myself, when thinking of myself will hurt so many people?"

"event","Today I worked 9-6.  I had the wonderful two year olds.  One child... the sister of the kid who spits, curses, and hits... bites people.  Horribleness.  She bit one kid on the hand... then bashed one kid in the nose... tried to bite me but did not succeed.  The only remarkable thing that happened today was she actually went to use the potty.  Like on her own... now she just turned 2... and has many delays... so the fact that she even like got the concept of it is remarkable.  You have to be a teacher to understand.

Anyhow this is the last week of classes, thank goodness.  One regular lecture then a final and I am all done.  I move into my apartment on the 15th... hurrah!!  Finally a big break from all the wonderful work down here.  I will miss my kids though.  EVen the kid who thinks his name is SPongebob (I hate the real spongebob btw) and Patrick.  SIgh.

Anywho... not too much else to update on... going to go finish chatting w/ peeps now.  

I miss Weikels... where have you been?  Are you still alive?????????? - Yes I know I spelled Caigel wrong."

"event","Ok... so this update will be very short.

Yesterday I got hit in the face and also spit in the face by the same kid.  Not to metion he threw toys all over the floor and spilled his water.  He also pushed a child who was holding water into the counter.

Today, this child hit me on the arm and left a hand print for a while.  Then he threw his cup of water across the floor.  Then he ran up to this kid who is like very tall and rather large for his age and just smacks him in the back.  Needless to say, He did not stay in my classroom for very long.  Not to mention the kid curses worse than I do and screams at the top of his lungs.  Horrible.

SO what an eventful time at work.  This one kid causes more problems than 15 of them combined.  It is amazing.  I dunno.

I am still a little sick... I have a new prescription now, but the doc wants me to go get a catscan of my sinuses to figure out why I am still sick and why the 1st medicine didnt work.   Oh, and I took myself off that nasty migraine medicine that made me too sleepy.  

I got a 90 on my criminology term paper.  I got a 66/77 on the in class paper that the professor was pissy about and walked out of class to assign it to us.  I will get an A in that class bc I have the final and participation left.  I could get as high as a 94 still. :)

Alright, I am tired annd I am going to stop typing... more updates to come."

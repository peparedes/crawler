"event","This will be the last entry in this journal.  I changed screen names, and when i do that my journal and e-mail must change along with it to match the screen name.  Yes, i do show signs of obsessive compulsive disorder.  New journal will be -
www.livejournal.com/users/histrionictragic.  dont check up on it until at least tomorrow because I wont be writing in it until then.  New screen name will also be histrionictragic.

Sorry about the previous emotional entry.  I dont realize why i write shit like that in this thing.  Am I attention strived?  Maybe.  

I was talking to a friend that i just started hanging out with recently and she just amazed me.  She made a comment about how she thought i was feeling and it was just, wow.  No one ever really does that.  Everyone just asks ""how are you doing"" and i say the usual ""fine"" and then the conversation is over.  But instead she just flat out said how she thought i was feeling.  And it felt good.  ""Am i attention strived?"" - correction = yes.

So Nik is going vegetarian.  For real.  Ive gone a week(except for lunch today because of a bout of doubt) and I think its something I need to do.  No, its not because its a trendy and ""liberal"" thing to do.  It's because its something that I have been contemplating for a good six months and I have tried before and never had the willpower to do.  Well, I think its time.  And I would pick a soy or veggie burger over real meat anyday.  

So what else has been going on in my life.  Relationship status is the same as usual.  But a lot of my friends seem to be in amazing relationships and i am incredibly happy for them.  I think im starting to believe that you can actually fall in love in high school.  I've realized that I think my mom was at my age, and i know a few friends who would consider themselves to be right now.  Sometimes teenage emotions aren't given enough credit.  I love how just because there is a ""teen"" attached to the end of my age i am considered to be an emotional nightmare.  Well, I am, but i dont necessarily enjoy fulfilling that stereotype. 

Spring break was good.  Very good.   Two months until graduation where I will cry horribly afterwards and probably regret my decision to graduate early.  But, what is done is done and I'm sure I will be fine.  

Goodnight."

"event","I missed that so much.  I missed walking through my house and actually being myself, actually talking to my mom and actually wanting to hang out with her.  when we went to the city and just walked through the streets and clothes stores being idiots i felt like i was with my best friend. 

but then theres nights like last night where things just get fucked up.  what was i thinking?  i have this image that i want to give off and i get so caught up in portraying that image that i hurt the people around me and fuck myself up even more.  its come to the point that i dont even know what i want with my life anymore.  i dont know what to do, let alone what i want to do. 

ive lived with this idea in my mind that my parents are out to get me, that they just are concerned about themselves and they only wantwhats best for them.  ive had this perception for years and every year it just gets intensified until eventually it just transformed into this hatred that i cant even explain.

and ive tried to think of ways to try and dull that hatred.  i went out with friends.  i did things i enjoyed.  i thought about drugs.  i thought about snowball.  i went to snowball.  despite all of the fucking controversy about snowball, i wouldnt have survived sophomore year without those two days.  this year they were fun and everything, but last years was the one that actually hit me.

but then i came right back to those hallways, and the same blue room that i used to sleep in and i hated things even more.  i wanted to get away from it even more.  and although i never really did anything drastic, say drugs or something, i came very close.  i thought that anything that could get me away from that house was something that would help me.  and so i left.  and since then ive been living in other peoples houses, sleeping in other peoples beds and eating other peoples food.  every weekend i have to leave where im at to go find someplace else to live for two days and every weekend its something different.  a new subtle way to ask if i can stay there for the weekend.  a way that i would be the least embarassed and the least intrusive.  well it still doesnt matter because it wasnt subtle and it was intrusive. 

and after all of this time im fighting and fighting to get back into that house.  this week was incredible.  i slept in my bed.  i read on MY couch.  i walked through MY house on MY floors and ate out of MY refridgerator.  i talked to MY mom and fought with MY brother.  everything was like it should be.  but then the weekend comes and it just starts again. 

when i was in the shower today i just thought about calling her and i finally convinced myself.  but once i was all dressed and dry and it was time to actually dial the number then it was gone.  i cant even pick up the phone. 

and the funny thing is she never seems to get the guts to call either."

I was scrolling through my old blurty just now, and it was definitely weird.  Its strange to just be able to click a mouse and read exactly what you were feeling in september.  I havent decided if i like that or not. 

So - went to eat with mom...and besides almost killing us while we were driving, things were good.  I love how i can be such a fuckin homo with her and she's so whatever about it.  and mom is seeing someone!  wow, i didnt think i would be so excited.  details later. 

so yesterday i was in chicago, and we went into this guy's art gallery and i was so inspired by it.  it was racy, sexual and morbid art, but it just had guts.  i guess he is bipolar, which just mystifies me even more.  he uses those emotions and he just lets them out in any way that he wants, even if that is by making statues of penises.  it was just...nice.

<b>So i got interrupted last night because my ride came, so Im finishing the entry.  Last night was hysterical...what losers people can be.  What losers I can be, and how <i>gross</i> Denny's is.  Fun times.  

So what is Nik doing today?  I dunno.  I want to read outside for a while i think, but other than that I have no idea.  I was in such a party mood last night driving home - i just wanted to go dance.  I've had this craving to go to a Foam party since last week - it looks fucking fun.  ""Even tho that girl died at one a while ago, it looks fucking fun!"" - Gregory.

Court TV sucks.  Why cant they have like real people on there instead of people who were dropped on their heads as babies?  Like seriously, its just stupid.  Who cares about property borders? Or suing for like five hundred dollars?  Not me.  But my thirteen year old brother seems very into it.  Ahh...adolescence in its beginning.

Friday night=karaoke night at some pizza place by Brookhaven foods on Plainfield.  Want to come?  

I am determined to do a lot of things this spring break - i have a list but, im not putting it on here.

i got an orange baseball T from the gap today - compliments of christine.  all i had to do was get a different pair of pants for her while she was in the dressing room.  Need some new clothes?  Befriend christine.  lol juuuuuuuuust kidding.

well this is a very random and meaningless entry, but thats sometimes fun.  Ever have rare evenings where you just love the way you look?  at least the outfit?  its one of those evenings.

"event","Theres this recurring thought that keeps going in and out of my head, and I just get this disgusting feeling in my stomach, and my heart starts racing and I can't even get a sentence out of my mouth.  Well maybe its not that dramatic, but whatever. 

I keep thinking, wow.  I'm almost eighteen.  I'm almost an adult, and fuck did my childhood fly by.  18 years...gone.  In a blink.  And I get scared, because what if the next 18 go by just as fast?  And the next 18?  And then the next.  Would there be a next?  

I dont want my life to be a blurp in time.  I want it to be something worth living.  Something that I can tell my children, if I have any.  Or my neices and nephews, or even my mom.  I want to MAKE my dreams work.  I dont want to be lying on my death bed in 70 years and realize that I had done nothing.  I dont want that.  I'm terrified of that. 

ALthough the mother - son situation is pretty much ruined forever, and I'm still sensitive about it, I can work around it.  Things have been going alrite.  This past week, although corny and overdramatic, was wonderful. 

I dont even know what I am trying to get at, but I felt that I needed to just let something out.  I feel like this ball of emotions all tied up and waiting to be unraveled.  And I've realized that although I tend to talk a lot about things to people, and usually am pretty open, I hide a lot.  I hide, a lot.  Maybe its not more than any other teenager, or any other normal guy.  But it feels like a lot to me.  My best friends dont even know things, and I'm sure they have things that have happened that they havent told me, but I always consider myself to tell them everything.  And fuck, I dont.  At all.  I feel so extroverted and introverted at the same time. 

On a lighter note I have eaten only healthy food for almost an entire week.  Maybe its because I have some sort of motivation this time.  Whered it come from?  I'll never tell.

::So i lay my head back down.
And I lift my hands and pray...
To be only yours, I pray...
To be only yours.
I know now, your my only hope.

Sing to me the song, of the stars.
Of your galaxy.
Dancing, and laughing again.
When it feels like my dreams are so far,
Sing to me of the plans you have for me,
Over again.

So I lay my head back down...::"

"event","So I have been thinking about this entry all night.  And im just going to say how I feel, and if people want to discriminate me for it, then fine.  But i just feel like posting it.

Ive come to the conclusion after seeing the Passion that I am not a christian.  And actually, its quite relieving.  Very relieving actually.  I feel like I know now kind of what I want to pursue.  Now dont get me wrong, there is something out there.  In my opinion, just I dont think that Jesus was who he said he was.  In fact, the movie pissed me off a great deal.  But im not going to get into that.  I just believe that Jesus was a person that for some reason people thought he was someone to worship.  And, personally, I think the writers of the bible glorified the details a bit(aka the rising from the dead).  But hey, thats just me.  Like I said, just letting the words out. 

I went to a Unitarian Church with Vicki and Naomi last sunday.  I have to say that it was something i thoroughly enjoyed(plus the added bonus of downtown hinsdale).  And the huge rainbow on the door made me smile from ear to ear.  Its not a gay church, they just welcome it and accept it(unlike many other churches i know)  And seriously, that is why I havent gone to any churches, because I know that uhm they think I am going to hell.

Which brings up another issue.  I cant understand how this loving God described in the New Testament can have such an eternal suffering.  It isnt logical.  This sounds off the wall, but what if this is hell.  What if this is the place that we have to prove ourselves in(or just survive through, or deal with) and then we are rewarded.  Because this world is pretty fucked up and there is so much suffering(maybe not around here, but sure as hell in other places).  And hey, if there is a hell and Im going to it for being gay, then fuck, ""its just gonna be one big gay club down there anyway""(greg).  But seriously, it just doesnt make ne sense to me. 

So now its time to rant about the current gay marriage issue.  At first I was kind of ""whatever"" about the subject, but in the past 2 weeks I have gotten so passionate about it.  I feel like going out and marrying somebody in protest.  It just DOESNT MAKE SENSE TO ME.  If your religious, and u dont believe that homosexuals should marry in a church, then FINE.  but PLEASE dont be naive enough to think that our country should be run on Christian principles because the entire country isnt christian.  Im not asking for the gvt to force churches to marry gays, Im asking for separation of church and state and allowing gays in the courts.  Its only fair. We were talking in Ad Us about it, and my teacher was talking about how Britney Spears can claim she believes in the sanctity of marriage, yet goes on her little less than 24 hour marital romance, and a gay couple whos been together for years cant marry.  Someone in my class got so heated and just said ""its immoral.""  Ok, Im sorry.  But not everyone has those principles.  Not everyone beleives that.  And it shouldnt even be an issue, because TEN PERCENT OF THE POPULATION is gay.  So your saying that ten percent of the population should be denied marriage?  Well, it seems a little bigoted to me. 

I just want to say that I cant help, and no one can help falling in love with someone.  Its not a choice.  I realize that isnt a common belief anymore, but there are still people out there who do.  More than I thought.  And its just ridiculous, because WHO would choose to go through being gay?  Imean, its not the easiest thing in the world to live with.  Did you know thirty percent of all teen suicides are homosexuals?  Kind of disproportional with the ten percent homosexuality rate.  Doesnt that clue people in that theres something going on here?  Maybe it is because people have yet to understand it. 

But on the account of the biggest homo himself -

"event","I dont think people realize sacrifices that I have made in the past few months of my life.  This weekend was the first time I really had fun...really went out and had a good time.  And today and yesterday I just felt refreshed.  Relieved.  I never realized how much having a social life is important to my happiness.  I dont mean superfluous parties or whatnot, but just being with people that i love being with.  Thats my definition of a social life, and I havent had one since December.

I have to admit that I loved being home for superficial reasons and I loved being home for honest and meaningrul reasons.  I loved talkng to my mom again, and seeing my brother again, and even seeing my stupid old cat again.  I loved being in my family room at two oclock in the morning listening to music and talking to kids online.  I missed my creaky bed and my messy room.  <b>I missed every ounce of that house</b>

Now mom wants me to go to my dads this weekend.  I havent talked to him in weeks, and I dont plan to in the near future.  Over and over again he proves the asshole and he proves the hypocrite and liar.  But throughout that past 4 months I was there every other weekend and forced the smile and forced the laughter.  I needed to.  I couldnt fuck that up and have no where to live at all.  Or not be able to see my brother.  But now after being home last weekend, I cant handle doing it again.  Putting on the show.  Becuase the smile i had at home was genuine.  The laughter this weekend was real.  And now when I actually <b>want<b> to go home for once she is telling me to go to my dads.  How is that supposed to make me feel, especially when she knows fully that i <i>dont enjoy being there</i>.

I want to go home so bad.  Im wondering why I even left in the first place."

Downtown with greg and some people last night.  Lets just say it felt great to a.) be downtown and b.)just meet some new people.  although i really only like met 1 new person it was just nice.  i dunno.  i havent been out enough lately and im just happy.

so the fucking ""cafe pride"" was the lamest thing i have ever step foot into.  why would gay suburban kids uhm go to the city to play board games?  so needless to say, we left.  once we resorted to stacking the jenga pieces into dif shapes...we knew we  had to get out of there.  had some good coffee after that, so it was still worth the trip.

went to Oak Park with naomi and got an amazing green bubble tea tonight.  it made my fucking weekend.  you have no idea how much i love those things.  i think the gelatin is an aphrodesiac.  

quote of the evening - ""they went fucking bubble crazy in my tea""

occurence of the weekend - greg stepping into fucking puke.  eew.  that boys dirty now. 

i have to admit that it has never felt better to be at my own house.  its amazing how something that you once despised so much can also be missed so much.  my old fucking creaky bed was amazingly comfortable, and my cat actually let me pet him.  and my mom and i are talkng.  like actually talking.   

by the way - like u care, but im posting it anyway - my mom looks gorgeous.  like i dunno wtf she has been doing, but she lost a ton of weight and she needs to tell ME how to do it thank you very much.  

AND today starts the day of not eating anymore, because i saw way too many hot people downtown tonight and last night to not do something.

"event","There are no words to describe the experience that I have had at this past snowball.  I thought that last winter was good, and then I was a leader in the fall and it blew winter out of the water.  And to say the least, this one did the exact same to the fall.  I cant describe the emotions that went through my head, but i will do the best that I can. 

Lets just start off with my small group.  I have never met a more diverse, open, and caring group of people in my life.  Ever.  Now that its over I realize how lucky I was to get a group like that for my last snowball.  Thank you guys, I will remember you forever. 

Besides the leader experience, and being a part in changing at least someone's life - I went through a metamorphosis as well.  Well, I at least feel like I have.  During the speaker - when he asked to think of a person you wish that you could help.  Only one person went into my mind and I couldnt help myself.  The tears came flooding and I couldnt keep it together.  We both need each other, and we both havent been there for each other.  I know I am just as guilty as she is.  But I cant be the one to start things right now.  Maybe in a few days, or a few weeks, or in a few months.  But now now, I'm just not ready.

Lets just say that snowball is something that I am going to miss with every bone in my body.  Plain.  Simple.  Period.  Thanks to everyone who has been a part of it.  If I didn't have it - I wouldnt be the person that I am today.

A lot of people aren't even christian in our country - ITS NOT FAIR FOR OUR PRESIDENT to talk about spreading HIS word of GOD to the country!  I'M SORRY...not everyone feels the same way he does!  He is a representative of our country as a whole - and AS A WHOLE - WE ARE NOT ALL RELIGIOUS.  Maybe a lot, maybe even a majority, but enough to matter where he should not be doing it in the way that he is doing it.  Especially when he talks like he is some divine fucking being.  Come on Bush, you sent people off to war to kill and get killed.  That doesnt sound too Christian.  Or how about practicing what you preach, hey Georgie.  If ur telling countries to disarm themselves, I'd like to see all of our major weapons disarmed.  Now.  Or are we too ""city on a hill for you.""  

Maybe I wouldn't feel this way if he didn't go on about the sanctity of marriage.  Ya know - THATS FINE if you religiously dont think that 2 men or two woman shud be married.  BUT DONT expect it to not at least happen in the courts.  Cuz ya know what - 11% of the fucking population is gay. And those people MAY want to get married.  It's a big deal to some people.  And you CANT use your RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, mr. bush, in your little spiel about it.  It's not supposed to be that way, remember?  Oh right, your above the separation of church and state shit.  Sorry about that, I forgot you were God.  

I feel so insulted and just cheated.  IM NOT EVEN INTO POLITICS.  AT ALL.  And I get so pissed off about it.  I get so angry that I almost started to cry.  Like full out cry.  Just from that one adress and what he plans on diong, I'm scared.  I'm just scared.  I don't fucking feel safe with him as my leader and representative.  

I feel so inactive in this.  I feel so helpless and useless and ignored.  I know thats half of my fault, and but seriously I dont know what to do.  I'm so overwhelmed with anger and emotion.  Its not like im against relgion in general, because I promise I'm not.  People know I'm not.  I'm very *or at least i try my hardest to be* very open minded about it.  But I'm sorry, its

not
supposed
to 
be
in
the 
government.

And I don't fucking understand why people think it is.  Or why it should be."

So I'm making another attempt at visting columbia tomorrow...and this time its with FAYERNA.  You have no idea how excited I am, like dude.  I never see that girl.

"event","I do NOT want to study for spanish.  I cant.  I will, but i cant.  Theres no way that I will be able to just not be tired, or stressed, or wanting to not do anything.  We'll see how productive today ends up being. 

Yesterday Lydia and I were talking about how there are high schools for JUST gay kids.  First of all, how fucking stupid is that?  Being gay ALREADY sets you aside from a lot of people - why would you want to make that separation even bigger?  Brent made a comment that is was just like how catholic high schools really dont let anyone in unless they are catholic - but to me it seems different.  No one(that I know of at least) gets made fun of legitamately for being CATHOLIC.  Hell, I'm gay AND catholic and i dont want to go to either type of school.  Or should I go to a GAY/CATHOLIC school.  Oh wait - mr. pope thinks im going to burn.  THATS a different story.  

But seriously - if the gap is ever going to be bridged completely between straight and gays - then gay people need to just live like everybody else.  I am out in school and I rarely am confronted about it at all.  Some fuckers from junior high said shit a lot last year - but it stopped.  If your not blunt about it, and you just are YOURSELF, and you dont make being gay WHO you are, just part of WHAT YOU ARE, then you'll be fine.  There are kids that i knwo that being gay is their LIFE...its all they talk about, its all they care about, its all they are interested...gay this gay that.  If you do that - the gap is never going to be bridged.  No matter what people are going to be uncomfortable sometimes that the person sitting next to them in class is openly gay...and you have to be sensitive to that.  I'm not saying repress yourself, just know your environment.  Fuck, if your at a gay bar then by all means do whatever the fuck you want.  But if you are in a classroom with someone next to you who maybe you dont know, or you know they dont know is gay - then its just like treat them like you want to be treated.  Give them their space, let them get to know YOU first before you scream in their face that your a boy and you like boys.  GOD THIS FRUSTRATES ME.  

This is the first time I've ever written an entry about this topic in general, so its kidna weird.  But the school thing is complete and utter bullshit - because these kida are going to be sent into this cucoon little world, and I;m sorry kiddo the world isnt going to be like that.  They are going to graduate and be thrown into the REAL WORLD...where there are real homophobes and there are people who are going to hate you just because of the fact of your sexuality.  it just doesnt make sense to me...i need someone to argue with that thinks there shud be these school...because in the long run for the kid all i see is harm for him or her. 

sorry if i was too blunt - things have been tense lately for me.  maybe once finals are over then itll ease...but i dont kno.  

good luck with the rest of finals guys - dont stay up too late."

"event","So its official.  I'll be a senior in a week.  Strange, but so relieving.  But in all the mess of deciding a major and everything, im in a rut.  do i sacrifice some of my happiness and go into something that i know will be financially stable?  Or do i go with my dreams and work my ass off and be proud that I did what I wanted to do, and didn't care about the money.  

I guses what I am wondering if this is a naive approach.  I want to follow the dream so badly - to just go to college and TRY to make it in theater.  Thats all i ask.  I want to try.  And then if it doesnt work, then I'll have the degree to work with.  But what if something happens along the way, or how am i going to support myself while trying to make it in theater?  AND theater does NOT pay well, so how am I going to do it and have time to make real money?  

I truly think that if i go into theater, or directing, or playwriting, i will be happy.  I dont need all this money that everyone is talking about - i'm a very frugal person, and I feel that I can make ends meet.  I may be paying off student loans for the rest of my life, but its something that I want to do so badly.  Im young, and im hopeful...and if that makes me naive then i dunno - im naive.

Someone said to me today when we were talking about the topic that ""your parents arent giving you any money for it because your going to go and get your degree and your going to have no future.""  I was just like, uhm thanks.  It hurt.  People dont seem to have dreams anymore, no one has the dream of being president or of being an actor or of winning the nobel prize like we used to when we were young.  But, the people that are those things today are the ones that held on to their dreams and didnt give up.  And the ones who arent, well they somehwere along the line lost grip and fell into the regular flow of life.  i dont want to be part of the regular flow.  i hate regularity.  

so thats the current issue.  I have to go fill out some stuff and study.  good luck to all on finals."

And I have discovered that when I have a lack of sleep I become the most emotional person in the world.  I almost broke down during Chemistry like 4 times in the matter of ten minutes.  

Then it got worse once I realized mom withdrew all of my money from my account and mysteriously moved it somewhere.  I cant even talk about it right now I am so pissed off. 

i indulged on starbucks and a smores brownie when igot home - fuck the new years eating healthy shit.  I needed fat food to calm me down.  it worked.

"event","So I had an appointment with my counselor(nothing to do with the guidance counselors at school) and I filled her in on my college planning stuff and where I am applying.  When I mentioned Columbia today she started talking to me about how she doesnt feel that it would push me to succeed...and that I handle a more rigorous education.  

So what is she telling me?  That I can't go to a particular school because its not the hardest school to get into?  Yeah I know the classes and the grades I have could get me into a probably a more ""rigorous"" school, but I want to go to Columbia, I watched their video online of all the stuff they have and I got shivers, its just like a dream.  And like my aunt always tells me, its just school.  If I dont like it, ""fuck it, and transfer.  people do it all the time""

Just because I have excelled in academics doesnt mean that I am not going to excel just as much in fine arts, or in theatre for that matter.  My mom and I have gotten into so many arguments about it, that Im not going to make any money.  Fuck, I could be the worst actor in the world, but I <i>love</i> doing it.  And so does writing.  Whenever I sit down for the short stories that I have written in creative writing, i keep wanting to write for hours upon hours, but i have to force myself to stop.  And hell, if I get there and its too easy, then I can just transfer to a more difficult school the next year.  I'll be a year ahead when I start off anyway, so really it won't affect me that much.  

I needed to write this entry - I got a lot sorted out in my mind.  At first I thought that I agreed with her, and now I agree she could be right, but I'm willing to take that chance."

I took an hour to fill out this scholarship-finder thing online, and it turns out you have to pay to use it anyway. this=frustration.

a certain conversation i had today reminded me of the fun i had in junior high.  we were such idiots.  every single digusting one of us.  it was one of those things that i was miserable going through, and then later realized how much fun i had.  im glad thats not the case with high school.

first real snow !  well...we had snow a while back before break, but i count this one because it will actually last.  snow day?  no.  but a good snow nonetheless. 

i have an animal print scarf that i think is lauren's???  i want to steal it...snowball is coming!

i like this entry...random comments about my life...

   Bath and Body Works Aromatherapy Stress Relief soap smells orgasmic

I was reading Sauer's post and it really got to me.  I havent told everyone ""formally"" or whatever you want to call it.  But it turns out that 2004 is going to be my new graduation year.  As long as mom keeps to her word and signs the slip then only one more semester to go.  Strange.  So strange that I can't even begin to comprehend the fact that I am going to be on my own next year.  I mean, its something that I've wanted since like what, 7th grade, but now that its so close its like ""wow...i didnt know you were so massive and powerful""  And its not like I plan on going someplace far, anyway.  The farthest college that I started applying to is in Des Moine, and thats only a few hours away.  The others are in the city - and thats my dream, to live in the city.  I love the energy that I get from being down there, and I dont think that I could ever get tired of it, which makes me a little shy to seriously consider going to Drake.  I know its a good school and everything, esp in what i want to major in.  But i dont think that I can handle going to a small school in Iowa.  I dunno. 

Its weird that I actually am in the process too.  I have first drafts for 2 of my essays, and thats all I will end up having to write because 2 of the colleges have the same question.  My Columbia one is the strongest, in my opinion.  But I dont have too many worries about the other one either.  Some fuel is keeping me going in the college process...especially being so last minute and rushed.  Hell, i havent even taken the ACT yet, and the deadline to register for it is coming up too.  That will be OH so much fun.  Ugh.

This post has no comparison to the one that i had started until computers decided to rip  it apart and leave its shreds in the internet world.

"event","Nothing is forever. Ive just realized. 

3 years ago I was in 8th grade, had a huge part in my first play, my parents were together and happy, and I didnt have any homework, ever.  And of course I was graduating in a few months. 

Now I'm a junior.   My dad cheated on my mom, and obviously they arent together.  School=stress, and I am graduating early to get away from my mother who enjoys making life difficult. 

Big change, huh?

Human nature seems to be to cling on to whatever is happening at the moment.  Because if we make ourselves think that something is going to be forever, then we can lay down on our soft beds and fall right asleep.  But if everybody went to bed knowing that everything was going to change the next day after they woke up, then they wouldnt get a week of sleep.

Everything changes.  The weather, the sky.  Me.  You.  Us.  This fucking journal changes.  Favorite bands break up.  People break up.  Lives break up.  Things fall apart.

The only trouble with human nature is that it hasnt figured out how to get us to be able to put the pieces back together and be happy again in a reasonable amount of time.  Instead it leaves us in the dark to fumble around with the puzzle, and waste time trying to cram the pieces together...until days, months, years, decades later we get lucky and 2 pieces match.  And 2 becomes 4.  And 4 becomes whatever...until the puzzle is finished.  And then guess what?  It starts over again.

So whats going to happen tomorrow?  A minute ago I was tired.  But suddenly I'm wide awake."

I am glad though that someone got to see how bitchy she really is, she is really moody and shit, i dont like it, especially when i fell asleep without saying goodnight and she gets all mad and shit and starts to cry, i mean can you say ""Possesive"", dont try and pull that pity shit on me you bitch, i dont buy it!! oh it makes me mad and is really meking me consider moving away when i turn 17, i dunno where to, but i will find a place, if any one of you all have somewhere i can stay, for a little while when school starts again, please email me at joepaquin1@AOL.COM. . . i just wish that she realized what she not only does to me but the rest of the family as well!!   I try and tell her and stuff, but all i get is bullshit, and i never get real answers out of her or anything, just complaining and bitching that she does everything to me and how she cant believe i am saying this and blah blah blah, oh fuck it all!   just go away you stupid bitch, im sick of all the shit and want out NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh well, im going to sleep now to cool off, im a little angry at the moment!!"

asking myself why

why i still do
you are on my mind
night and day
im soo confused
wishing for your love
yet wanting to go
i love you and i miss you
you broke my heart
tore it out
ripped it apart
now i want
for love to come again
to break my heart yet once more


oh my god, sorry, i dont have a title for it, please post your comment on a title. . . 
but otherwise, i love you all!!!  oh i dont know what i would do without you!! You know who you are. . ."

"event","so my relationship chat thing, well i think they are a real distraction, i have a real hard time balancing my school, and other things, oh well, but ya know how that is, i love her and stuff. . .yea, im so contradictory to myself so often, i mean i tell people one thing but live another thing, like my parents barely know who i really am. . .i live like six different lives, just to make people happy, i dont like it, i mean i barely know who i am, and i know that the counselor is right, i have not discovered who i truly am and i dont think i will ever, i just dunno, oh well. . . yeah i'm gonna keep going on about pretty much nothing, but as you can see this is a great vent for me!!  I think it is really helping, i mean i have been a little happier now that i have something to talk to. . . so yeah a little more about myself, i am in the GSA at school, it is a great club, i just like the support and stuff, but we are supposed to be supporting and educating, but those damn lazy kids sign up for stuff and never do anything!!! oh well, i will do what i can, but im very limited on time.  oh well, and the advisor is so cool, her name is candy and she is just great, i mean she is always there for anyone, and no matter what my parents say im going to youth pride next year!!  it is a great way to support my friends, yeah i have a few guys in the GSA that probably wish i way gay or at least bi, but i dunno, as i said earlier, i am not sure who i am yet, so who knows. . .so yeah i went to prom this year, this is really when my feelings for georgia came into full force, we were dacing at the prom and i was just looking at her and being so happy, and stuff, and i wish i would have just kissed her and come to find out she was thinking the same thing, so yeah the prom was nice, and stuff, and i went to pat's house for the after prom party, it was interesting, i got there and dan and georgia and pat and ann and a few others were there, so i was there and sat next to georgia, and i tried the bacardi silver stuff, that was gross!!  but dan gave me some rum and orange juice, that was good, we'll get to that later. . . so yeah we were there and pat went to bed and it was me, dan, ann, and georgia so we were sitting and enjoying the night and well i fell asleep for a few hours, and so did ann and dan, and georgia stayed up, it was weird, but whatever, so in the middle of my sleep i went to sleep on the couch, and woke up, and a few minutes after awaking i was jumped by georgia, and she proceeded to lick my face, it was disgusting but nice in a way!! hehehe yeah and she was saying should i or shouldn't i, and i was lost but was filled in later by ann that she was planning to kiss me, but i was rudely interupted by my stomach saying that the rum was going to come back up, so that was weird and not much else happened there, but i had fun, it was nice. . . that was prom. . . and for tonight that is it, until tomorrow!!"

"event","Well after departing ann's we went to the center of Barre and hung out for quite some time. . . We called georgia to see if she could leave, but she couldn't. . . oh well. . .then we hung out until we found evan and tom(tom is ann's ex), and we decided to go and see my friend Don, who died a few weeks ago, it is a shame that he died, he was an extremely great guy!  his funeral was the first time i cried in a long time and the first i cried in front of people i knew. . ., that was depressing to do, i mean he doesn't even have a headstone yet, after visiting don, we went to visit a few other graves and returned to the center, we hung out there and decided to go to the playground at ruggles lane, this was fun, we were there for about five-ten minutes and ann's mom and uncle showed up to bring her brother and sister to the playground, a few minutes after they arrived, we went to the Barre Teen Center, i was a new member, woohoo...  so we hung out there and watched the Hot Chick, it was fun, but i dont know how much of it ann saw as tom was there, she wants him back so bad. . . oh well, its here life, but i think she should go out with dan, dan is a great guy but he is 21 and ann is 16, a little problem, i think they would make a good couple, they are so good together, dan is a great guy, i could talk to him about anything, he has helped me for just being himself. . .so this was the conclusion of our night, we left the Teen Center and went home, i got home and surprisingly enough my parents didn't yell at me, i mean whenever i come home im yelled at for some reason or another, that's why i spend so much time away from home, that was fun!  so this week has been very interesting, senior exams and stuff, oh i think im gonna cry, georgia is leaving, but she isn't going anywhere, i just love her so!  i wish i could have her exclusively, i think the only thing she really wants from me is sex, but whatever, i mean ya know i love her and all, but if she is not willing to make a commitment i think it wont work, but for now it'll stay like it is, im debating whether or not to go to her graduation party, i mean we have a show and all, it makes me feel weird making ben do lights and stuff for a night because i want to go to her graduation party, oh well, i mean he knows i really want to go and i think he doesn't mind, we just have to find a person to do the sound for the one night, it should be interesting, i dunno, im really confused. . .I have been slacking in school because i have been thinking of georgia 24/7, and i dont think she realizes this,  she will someday, i mean if she is willing to make a commitment i am willing to stay with her for the rest of my life, she just makes me happy, you can see the source of my depression already, can't you???  oh well, i mean i've had many thoughts of suicide and all that, peirced myself to relieve stress and stuff, and i have been smoking lately too, i just have so much on my mind, i dunno, my parents found my butts the other day and really weren't mad at me too much, but they were mad, i just wish they would lay off, i mean if they are going to have anything to say about that they should stop themselves, but ya know they dont realize this.  I dunno, i have been thinking lately of just going to school in the summer at the mount and finishing high school as soon as possible, but i really want to take the computer courses, i really enjoy them!!  So yeah, my dad has been yelling at me to work more, but if they are yelling at me for not being at home enough then why are they telling me to work more, i mean i love my job, its the best job in the world, i show up when i want and leave pretty much when i want, but i know my boss wants me to work more, he needs the help, i have always been there to help. . .so whatever happens happens, i have put in a request for a job at donna's pizza, i dunno how much im gonna be able to work, i mean i think im gonna work at night sweeping and i have rehearsal until ten, i dont know when im gonna sleep, im gonna be like dan, who by the way is a paramedic, he always is around, i dont think he sleeps at all, but i know he does, but at different times, i dont know how he does it, oh well. . .I met a cool guy in the center of town, his name is corey, he is 23, and is just pretty cool, he gets into a lot of trouble im assuming, i mean he is always loitering and stuff, but otherwise he seems pretty nice.  all that runs through my head is georgia, georgia, georgia, do you think i have an obsession???   i think i do, i have went to the counselor at school and she can tell im hiding stuff even from her, but ill let her see this stuff, i mean she is great i wish i would find the power to tell stuff to her face but im not that type of person to ask for help, lately has been so stressful that i needed to tell someone, i need to go see a physcologist to diagnose my problem, amybe its just my relationship stuff, i have been the last few years single because i find them to be a distraction, i have a hard time managing my time, and stuff. . . im gonna publish this before my comp freezes and so lena can see it"

My life. . . . . . Well im a junior at Quabbin high school in barre massachusetts.  i have an active life in the local theatre, this is a good place, a sort of haven from the world and my life, it provides a distraction for me.  I work for a company in ware massachusetts,i landscape!! Well to start off ill tell  of my day, this seems as good a place to start as any. . . . Well i awoke this morning worried about what the girl im dating was going to tell me, i had heard she had something to tell me, but i did not know what it was.  I was really wondering, but i will tell of this later.  I went to school where i felt like i was going to die all day.  In my independant study period i talked a little with this girl im dating, i miss her so, she is a senior and graduating, oh i will miss her so.   I mean to have had her always there to talk to on the way to class and things and now to not have her there makes me really depressed.  Well i walked her to her last final and she still did not tell me about what she needed to, oh i was so worried.   But i got over it for a little while, i went to french where i just dazed the whole class, but my teacher doesn't mind, im doing well in that class.  And then i proceeded to web page design, this is my favorite class, i can do anything i wish because i know all that my teacher is teaching me.    and then i went to english, one of the classes i like but i dont do well in, figures. . . i went home and was planning on going out with my friend ann, oh this is where i heard that the girl im dating, georgia, had to talk to me, and she did not tell me what it was, oh this makes me mad!!!!  but anyway, i went home and called her after doing some things around my house and checking my email, and we planned on going to the Barre Teen Center, cool and she said that georgia may come also, this made me happy!!  So i went and dropped my brother off in oakham, and went to ann's house.  We left pretty much right away. . .  Well, my time on the computer is almost up, so i will finish tomorrow"

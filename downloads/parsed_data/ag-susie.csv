The awesomest dollie ever-EVER!!!!!!!  But now the icons are down to Susie, Felicity and myself, plus the Coconut one.  We're the three who seem to post the most, I guess.  But of course since it's technically Susie's lj, she can make Lissie and I use the Coconut avvie, too-but you don't want that to happen do you?  *You shake your head, no.*  Good, I didn't think so.

My Webshow!!!!!  The Jessica McConnell Show!!!!  It's awesome!  I really should film a new episode soon-just need to get an idea, hehe.  Actually I have part of one in mind :)  It involved the new girl, Gwen, and something we (Melissa's dolls) and Grandlinda's dolls got for Christmas from Molly J.'s mom/first owner.  Oh and btw, Molly J. is now Melissa's. She was Grandlinda's before and for a little bit Melissa wasn't sure if she was going to get her Molly.  But Grandlinda had said that Molly J. would be hers sometime and the Melissa kept talking about Molly and so in the fall, Grandlinda gave Molly J. to Melissa-totally sweet isn't it?  Molly is actually sleeping over in Kirsten's and my cabin tonight and says 'hi!'

But this post is about the awesomeness that is my webshow! So, if you haven't seen any or all of the episodes yet, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=D7F09B474688C9D9"" target=""new"">go here</a>.  And email me suggestions for what you'd like to see in future episodes :)

I hope everyone's 2010 is going well so far.  It's almost Feb already.  

Cherished Playtime (Melissa's doll site) has a Facebook group now :)  It's awesome and is called Cherished Playtime Fans.  It has 10 members so far :)

Other than school for us dolls, nothing too much has been going on.  We did great in the Nutcracker performance.  It was a lot of fun as always and I don't think I made too many mistakes ;)  The winter festival in general was fun as usual!  It was only one day because the first day, it snowed a lot.  But that's okay.  I always love going to it-it's just not the holidays without it!

Gwen Thompson and Sarah Williams and Anna Larson moved to Star Valley, on Christmas.  Gwen is Grandlinda's doll and Sarah and Anna are Melissa's-Anna is a Ty kitty.  Ooh and I got a Mini Ruthie doll for Christmas/birthday!  She's so pretty; she and my mini Nellie became best friends instantly!  

Oh, Gwen and I have a ton of things in common: 1. We both have blond hair   2. We both have brown eyes  3. We both are in 5th grade  4. We're both shy  and 5. we were both born on Christmas!  It almost seems like we should be long lost twins or something but we're not related at all.  It's just such a major coincidence.  And, I mean, she's nice and all and we get along...but still!  But, I came here on Christmas 2005 (and am awesomer, lol!)  There's only one Susie Kent that I know of-me and many Gwen Thompsons.  But anyway...

I have to get off the computer now, before I get in trouble for not doing my homework.  I'm supposed to do it before Sunday, so I get it done on time but I have a bad habit of procrastinating.

PS:  Kit says she already knows who will be coming here for this coming Christmas!  She of course has been sworn to secrecy.  Now I'm really curious to know!"

It is modern, with lights and such, but I also live with a modern cousin and my aunt is modern, though I think once she gets new outfits, she'll be semi historical.  We've brought down Noah's Ark and play with it daily while we listen to Christmas music.  We listen to a variety since we've got colonial me, modern Megan and Aunt Martha and 1824 Mexico, Josefina, living together.

Anyway, the annual Star Valley Winter Festival is tomorrow and Sunday!  'Tis so exciting!  We are again performing Selections From the Nutcracker and this year, I am Clara :)  A few of the Water St. crew is in it, too.  Our performance is tomorrow night!  I think a couple of the songs will be video-taped and we're doing a photo story of it.  

Well, I have to go help Aunt Martha bake cookies for the festival.  Then I've got to feed Penny and work on my gift for Josefina and...there's just so much to do before Christmas!

This summer went by fast though I didn't do much.  The most fun thing I did this summer, besides play lots of dolls, was going with Traveling Laurel and Auntie Jenny's mini Rebecca, to see Rent (along with Missy, Grandlinda and Auntie Jennie).

A new girl, Heather, arrived a few weeks ago.  She's nice.  

Jess colored a strip of her hair green.  I thought she was going to post about it but maybe she forgot.  Traveling Ruthie and Traveling Alex visited in May/June, which was fun.  Traveling Laurel will be visiting soon.  I'm so sleepy, I have no idea what to write.  I wish something more exciting was going on at the moment.  Hopefully we'll write more often.  I'm sure Jess, Rose and Marina will share about camp when they get back.  Though I'm considering just making this my blog and keeping the Coconut avvie for the others, instead of 5 main writers...I'm not sure.  I might keep it as it is.

She seems really nice and I can't wait to meet her!  I'm not sure if she dress like me or if she'll dress modern or both.  I'll definitely let her borrow my dresses if she wants to wear them, especially until both of us get even more clothes.  Hope said that if all the paperwork gets done quickly enough, than she might be able to come here in a couple of months-that's very exciting!  Right now she is living in a foster home.

She's undecided about Sonali or whether she wants another pair of twins-aren't Rose and Rosalind enough?  She says she wants identical twins (aka the 2 of the same doll)...well...what about Nicki's sisters?  I dunno...maybe I'm not a fan of it because I don't have a twin.  This also means that Sarita probably won't be coming here.  It'll either be Sonali, Julie and #28; #28 and Julie; Sonali and Julie; or some combo of one of one doll and two of another-with this either Sonali or #28 would be out. Oy.  Maybe Missy should just get Julie-one Julie.  

Anyhoo...I got my Outdoor Play outfit!  And it's awesome!  I look adorable in it-I mean, this outfit was MADE for me!  It's one of my new faves!  Grandlinda is the best :D

Here's a pic of me in my new outfit:

Grandlinda also bought cookies!  So my little tummy gets to be happily stuffed-yummy!

Oh and Missy just said she has an interview at BK on Monday which means one of us gets to ride along (for luck-and she'll hide a mini doll in her purse, too).  I wonder who it'll be."

I didn't do anything to it so why would it be a pink flower?  It was so weird.  And of course my real avvie was deleted from the computer, so I had to quickly make a new one.  It was just so weird; I've never had that happen before.  None of the other avvies changed and nothing else changed?  Was it just an lj glitch?  My name was still the keyword but...weird.  And spooky.  

So, anyhoo, I've got a new avvie though it's nowhere near as cute as the one with Fluffy.  This one is my school photo, from September.  Oh well...  I hope you guys like it anyway.  And I hope that doesn't happen again.

MISSY RUINED MY STUFF!!!!!!!!!!  She was putting on Sarah' freckles yesterday and just <i>had</i> to do them in her room so she could look at photos of the actress who played as Sarah in Labyrinth, in order to do it, and...SHE WAS HOLDING THE PAINT AND HER HAND JERKED AND THE SPOON FLUNG OUT AND SPLATTERED PAINT ON THE FLOOR AND HER WALL...<font face=""arial"" size=""4"" color=""red"">AND IT GOT ON TOSHI AND MY BLANKET AND KIRSTEN'S STUFFED DOG, CUPID...AND MY PILLOW AND MY MOLLY DOLL AND SAMANTHINA AND A TEENSY BIT ON COCONUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</font>

Now there's a huge brown stain on my blanket-brown spots on my pillow.  Cupid has brown all over his back.  Most of the paint came off Coconut (it was near his butt-ewwww) and Molly's sweater and Samanthina's sleeve (luckily not much got on them).  And Missy did wash Toshi as best she could but he's still got a couple small light spots on him that make him look dingy now.  

I'm just soooo mad!  

Missy said that she didn't mean for it to happen-it was an accident.  And that I should be lucky nothing got on Peter or Caro who were both in the cabin.  And that I should be really lucky that I wasn't in the cabin when it happened.  And I am...but...it's still bad.  I mean, who wants a icky brown spot on their blanket?!  It's my favorite blanket and the paint even seeped through a couple of spots so it's brown and icky on both sides.  

I hate Missy and I hate Sarah!

Missy said that when she moves to her grandma's, she's going to bring Kit, Maddie, possibly Addy and another of us who will rotate out whenever grandlinda comes down.  The others might rotate out, too-same with Nikki, Hallie, Rilla and Ralf...or a non-SV stuffed animal.  Kit wants to go because Missy will most likely be rooming in the attic-almost like Kit herself.  I get to go first, too.  We'll all be sharing clothes since Missy isn't bringing a lot.  

In SV news, there isn't a whole lot going on.  Mrs. Halliwell got sick and so our class (5th grade) didn't have a Valentine's party.  Oh well.  I don't think any of us made cards anyway.  Well, I actually bought some but I'll hand them out sometime.  Mrs. Halliwell should be back teaching next week.  Hopefully no one else in her home got sick.

The first time we read my book, Missy thought about Sarita coming to live here but it didn't happen.  Then she-and I-thought about it again.  Sarita would probably be a #2 since that's easiest. A Josefina with #2's hair was also thought of but that would be more money and she just doesn't really want to do that.  But I keep telling her a #2 is Sarita.  I also keep telling her that Sarita has darker skin than me, naturally.  I just got really tan from being in Belize.  I wonder how many other Sarita dolls there are...it doesn't matter how many there are though-I just really want my good friend to move here-you better Belize it!

Anyhoo, Missy said that maayyybbbbeeeee Sarita will join us.  She also said if I can earn half the money (about $50).  So, I've still got jewelry to sell.  Anyone interested in seeing what I've made?  I so hope I can earn that $50.

Oh and on another note.  Grandlinda bought a #30-Nancy McConnell Yung.  Nancy Pantsy is my cousin.  She's part Irish and Scottish American (her mom and my dad are siblings) and half Chinese American.

Tomorrow we're going to the Manchester Monarchs hockey game; it's part of a Girl Scout Cookie Rally (strange they're doing it after everyone has sold cookies, instead of before the selling begins).  Missy and grandlinda went Dec. 2007, last time, but didn't bring any dolls because it was the first time they went.  But Missy had said that if they went again than I would get to go and I do!  When I heard I quickly tugged on my old hockey jersey (thanks, AG, for making it look all clean and new-it's supposed to be old and dirty-ish-yanno, clean but with stains) and Juniors vest and grabbed my hockey stick and puck.  Linda doesn't have a sash yet so Susie is letting her borrow her vest.  Linda and I decided to play some hockey of our own.  I of course have to leave my hockey stick and puck at home, tomorrow, but that's alright.  Missy said I can ""Chuck a Puck"" and that she'll get orange foam sometime and make a doll-sized Chuck a Puck for me as a souvineer.

I wonder if there will be any other Mia dolls there tomorrow, since lots of GS troops will be there and it is a hockey game and there's the whole Mia hockey/skating thing.  Missy and grandlinda help out with a Cadette troop; grandlinda is a co-leader and Missy is an adult volunteer.  In Star Valley, Mrs. Halliwell is our troop leader.

She doesn't like them though)-anyway, Shirley's jealous.  She loves hockey, too but she already promised to babysit Nicki's baby sisters.  If I have any money, maybe I can get her something.

Missy looked at all the #28s displayed; she said that one will probably come here sometime (after Sarah and possibly either before or after Julie).  I guess she'll live with Samantha, in Star Valley-the Sam who is for Christmas.  Missy said she keeps thinking about which dolls she still wants, probably because she wants to *finish* getting us AGs and then concentrate more on accessories and furniture.  She's not sure if 18, 19, or 20 AGs (yikes!) will be her limit-it depends on what the supposed new historical will look like and whether or not Jess really has a twin.  Sarah, #28 (Missy hasn't told us her name yet), Julie and Molly are dfinites, on top of Sam and the other girl who will be here for Christmas.  

Anyway, I didn't get anything at Boston.  Missy only had enough to pick up an outfit for Jenny-well her dolls-and then she realized now she'll have to transfer even more money from her account in order to ship Corde home.  Corde will be going home sometime on Monday.  

In SV, we had the annual tree lighting ceremony on Sat. evening.  It was nice and there was caroling, too.  

I'm not sure if I'm getting anything for my bday but my guess is no...maybe though.  I'd really love some new PJs-ones that aren't strictly winter.  I did have a nightie but I decided to wrap it up as a present for one of the others.  I'd also love a blanket or quilt or something...and a pillow.  But I doubt I'll get all that...

"event","So...Kirsten and Peter's puppy is going to be maimed.  Not really but...earlier this summer Caro grabbed Fluffy and I tried pulling on him to get him back and...HIS TAIL BROKE OFF!!!!!!!!!I still have it on him...sorta...but it's not attached.  Do I have to stick a tack in his butt so he'll be like Eeyore?  lol-that would be funny!  He still purrs but yeah...evil Caro.  Caro gets at everything!  He tries to get Toshi, too-bad puppy!  I miss Kirsten-Caro listens to her!

School starts in a couple weeks.  I'm happy about it because I'll be away from the evil puppy for a few hours.  I'll have to bring Fluffy and Toshi with me to school so evil puppy doesn't destroy them.  Why can't we have a cat?

Felicity came by yesterday riding...none other than DEMON HORSE!!!!  Demon horse took one look at me, snorted and I ran for the hills-actually into the cabin.  And Felicity wondered why.  Duh-it's DEMON HORSE!!!!  Lissie says DEMON HORSE isn't a demon but...I know better  *nods.*

Missy's boss loves the gifts!  She saw them this morning.  Mini Kirsten was the perfect choice.  Her boss said that she was almost going to be named Kirsten-ad her name is similar.  That would've been funny since their names are similar already.  

Speaking of Kirsten...she's been in VA but only just got opened a couple days ago b/c she got to Laura a tad too late.  But I'm sure Kirsten was fine with that.  She can turn any situation into something fun.  Like when she and Mischa got stuck in Missy's theatre prof's office-they built a fort out of books!  

We all miss Kirsten and we're all just waiting for school to start again pretty much.  In a couple weeks.  Also there's ballet rehearsals and I've got a violin recital that will be coming up soon so I'm busy learning music for that.  Then there's another in Dec.  Or late Nov.  I can't remember at the moment!

Missy says her boss will love me.  They love Josefina and everyone else.  It's so nice that they support Missy's love for us!  Missy actually she told me that she thought of an interesting surprise for her boss-she got her a mini Kirsten!  And today her boss saw a photo of big Kirsten in the catalog and she said ""she's cute.""  So hopefully she loves Mini Kirsten.  We don't even have Mini Kirsten yet.  Missy told us she almost wanted to laugh when her boss had said Kirsten was a cute doll, because of mini Kirsten.  That is amusing.  I'd have a hard time not laughing, too.  

Anyway, I'll hopefully update this tomorrow, after we find out the results of the surprise.

And...because Kirsten has her own blog on blogspot and because she's gone for the whole year, Susie bumped her off the main poster list and I'm back on!  I was so happy!  At first she wasn't sure if Gabby or Mischa or even Megan might want it but then she remembered me so I got first choice.  My pic is from last smmer at the beach.  Not that anyone can tell from the pic since it's all cropped and smaller and everything.  

Anyway, not much is going on in Star Valley.  We're starting to plan for the winter festival already!  Julie, one of our friends who doesn't live in SV, might be doing the pre-show music this year.  I did it last year.  

Um...everything else has been pretty quiet both in SV and out.  Gabby and Nicki are both at the farmhouse and will probably come back in a week or two and then either Addy or Josefina will go to spend time with Missy at the farmhouse.  I hope after them, I might be able to go but there aren't any promises.  

Oh!  I can't remember if I posted this already or not (so sorry if I did).  Last week, Missy got me an Uglydoll!  I got Puglee.  She's pink and looks sorta like a pig-and best of all she's a straight-A student like me!  She loves to read, write and do math.  I thought that was so neat!

The next thingI knew, Missy saw me and yelled; I was caught red-handed!  You'll have to look at the album to find out what I'm talking about: http://picasaweb.google.com/cherisheddolls/TravelingPants

I'm back at home since Missy went home with Grandlinda on Sunday and I so I went home, too.  I was going to come back again but I decided that since I got to host the pants, someone else could meet the new girl.  So, we all decided Gabby was a good candidate.  So, she went back.  We've all been staying for 2-3 weeks so sometime next month, either Josefina or Addy will probably go and spend time with Missy and Rilla.

Anyway, we're all wondering who the new girl is. Gabby said she's supposed to arrive tomorrow.  She's coming from the MCM sale and all we know is she should have good hair.  I think it'll be Nicki...Jess thinks Marisol would be cool to hang out with (b/c Jess took over AFTER Marisol but Nicki took over AFTER Jess).  And Felicity is of course hoping it's Sarah (a #25 who will have hazel eyes-Missy says she's definitely coming sometime-Sarah is from Labyrinth).  It's so exciting to know who it will be!

Oh well, I'm missing my little sister, Madeleine, already and want to spend summertime with the others anyway.  And Susie's missing Missy a lot and Missy's missing Susie a lot (Susie's one of Missy's favorite AGs).  So, Susie should come back.  

But don't worry; I can post stuff that goes on at home/around Star Valley!  Ooh, and the Traveling Pants should be coming sometime this month, so Susie wil be able to go to the office with Missy, in them (and maybe even out) and have her pic taken!  I'm sure everyone will love her-she's sweet and shy like Missy!  I'll miss it here but I think some of the others will be happy to spend part of the summer with Missy, too, since they didn't get a lot of time to spend with her over the school year, I guess.

I still don't want to go but I'll help her practice what her prof. told her to say for when she calls the guy back.  She said she's nervous she couldn't even think of what to say if she gets the machine again or if he picks up.  And she's had a couple of false alarms already.  Josefina is downstairs waiting-Missy plans to hug her tightly the whole time she's on the phone.  

Even though I don't want Missy to get the internship and leave for the summer,  *sighs* I am hoping she gets it-she wants it and has worked hard, applying and having her first job interview and everything.

"event","Missy applied to an internship about an hour away and she's waiting to hear back to see if she got it or not.  If she does, she won't be able to host anyone over the summer (Grandlinda will have to host solo) and that also means she wouldn't be here again, for all summer.  She said she would bring Kit because Kit can hopefully help her try to actually save money and also her movie comes out in July, so if there was a way Missy could get to a nearby movie theater, she could still bring Kit to see her movie.  

I'm sad because I don't want Missy to go.  It's always been hard during the school year when we've been home and she was off at campus with one or two of the others.  I can't imagine all those years when Felicity was the only AG around here.  That must've been wicked hard.  

I'm like Missy in that I also hate certain types of change.  We were going to have lots of fun this summer and now it might not happen as much. I mean, we'll still have fun with Grandlinda and her dolls (Sam, Nellie, Bridget, Jenny, Molly and Emily) but it won't be the same.  Why does stupid real life for humans have to get in the way?  I mean, I'm glad Missy might actually get an internship but I'm sad that she wouldn't be here with us.  It's bad enough Kirsten is going to be gone until April!  I'll miss her a ton!  And if Missy gets the internship, they'd be leaving around the same time.  I wish there was a way she could take me along, too.  But she says she doesn't want to bring a lot of stuff (it's not like a whole school year at college) and since she'd have roommates, she doesn't want anything to happen to us.  One of us would be plenty.  Plus she said I'm too special to her; I was fine last year when I went with her to college but that was also different b/c she knew her roommate and suitemates were fine with us dolls being there.  Here she wouldn't know anyone.

Is it horrible I'm secretly wishing Missy doesn't get the internship?  I know I should be happy for her if she does get it-and I would be but...I just don't want her to be gone all summer long.

by Kit Kittredge

This just in.  Kit Kittrdge's birthday is in 4 whole days.  May 19th.  At the moment a party seems far fetched as the family doesn't have much money and so pennies have to be pinched unfortunately.  It's not fair!  When intervied about this, Miss Kittredge replied, ""I really wish I could have a party.  I'm new to Star Valley and it would be a great way for me to get to know everyone else more.  However, my sister and I live a 1930s lifestyle for the most part and that means we don't have much money.  We grow a garden and we pinch pennies and stuff like that (yes, I am partly modern, too).""  If anyone is willing to give this awesome A+++++++++++++++ tomboy a party, please call 555-3636.  Or send invites to your friends if you'd like Miss Kittredge to be surprised.

P.S.  Kit needs an avvie or her own on here.  So she can post more Hard Time News entries."

Jess and Nikki are doing a song and I found out that Marina, Rose, Mischa and Kit are doing a song.  They wouldn't even let me be in it and Rose was pretty rude about it, too.  So, luckily Kaya and I are going to do a song together.  We're doing ""Getting Lucky"" from The Chipmunk Adventure.  I love that movie and the songs-Alvin and Chipmunks are cool!  

Anyway, the rough draft for my project is due on Monday.  And I've got...nothing done on it.  I have math homework, spelling and grammar homework to do tonight.  Blah.  Then maybe Kaya and I will proctice for airband after that, again.  It gets to be a serious competition around here as everyone wants to be the best.  Some people don't do it at all.  Megan didn't seem interested in participating-just in working on her research paper.  I don't know if Rosalind, Hallie or Addy are doing anything...or Ralf or Bluey but who knows.  Either way, I can't wait for field day.  Esp. since we have about a month of school left.  Ugh!  Why can't it be over already?  

Anyway, I don't think there's much else going on.  Kit is settling in nicely.  She's always ready to report something new, even if it's something small.  She says she wants to write for the town newspaper, the Star Valley Times.  She wants to start a kids' section and she said she wants me to submit some stories and poems.

"event","Hello.  My name is Mischa Renee Jennifer Adams.  I am 9 (in 4th grade) and have red hair and hazel eyes; my birthday is April 23rd.  I love figure skating and playing hockey.  I also love playing softball and watching baseball games.  I think the All American Girls Proffessional Baseball League is very interesting.  My favorite color is purple.  I really like blue-vilet.  I love playing video games and can be competative.  I have an older sister who is 11.  

Ummm...I love penguins and walruses.  And I think I'm pretty friendly and sometimes I'm pretty outgoing but sometimes I can be shy.  I dont really like talking to people I dont know well.  I am usually pretty quiet in school but I like to raise my hand if there is a question I know the anser to.  I also sometimes ask questions in class but most times I try to go up to my teacher afterword and ask, if I'm not to nervus.  So sometimes I'm outgoing and other times I'm really shy.  I think it depends who I'm with and what is going on and stuff like that.  I am also kind of sensitive.  I sometimes cry if I am frustraited or if someone comments on something I did and it sounds bad.  I hate losing and not doing well on something.  

I'm looking forword to meeting everyone Kirsten has talked about.  She greeted me on the 23rd, when I arrived and told me about everyone at home.  I also saw Felicity but she woudn't talk to me :(  I dont know why either.  She says she hates me and Kirsten tried to explane it but I was still confused.  And then me and Kirsten modeled some costumes on Thur. and after Missy took us to her proffesser's office where she said we were going to hang out for a little bit.  Her proffesser was really nice and friendly and I was pretty quiet but did talk a little.  And Kirsten stuck out her tunge and stared at him with wide eyes when he was not looking.  She made me giggle.  It was funny!  But then Missy never came back and we relized that that we were stuck in the proffesser's office b/c he left and locked the door and never came back that day.  So Kirsten and I figured out how to turn the lights on and emailed him.  I wound up crying cuz I was confused as to why Missy did not pick us up and why her proffesser left us alone and never came back.  Kirsten tried to cheer me up and we built a fort out of the proffesser's books which he did come back yesterday and saw the fort...he kind of tour down a wall and Kirsten got mad and tried to hit him.  She had to have a talking to but we did not tell Missy.  Missy did come and get us yesterday morning.  She told us that she did not mean to leave us alone the whole night but by the time she was going to pick us up, the door was locked.  She gave us big hugs!  (Mr. proffesser guy-if you read this, thanks for taking care of us!  It was fun hanging out with you and thanks for helping us pick up all those books-sorry we got rambunkshush like you told Missy).

Anyway...after modeling the costume on stage, and from watching Shirley Temple movies and other movies and stuff, I think acting would be fun.  I want to try it.  I mean, altho I can be pretty quiet I like that you can be someone else for awhile when you act.  Missy says she loves acting, too-and likes pretending to be someone else for awhile too, and some of the other dollies I'll meet when I'm home like/love acting also.  Missy says I'm sort of like her in personality as well as looks but we do have differences, too (like the fact that I can skate and play softball and our favorite animals are different, to and stuff).  She says I'm like Susie, to.  Susie is also shy and quiet and gets nervous easily and hates talking to people she doesnt know and cries easily when frustraited and loves acting and stuff like that.  Missy says we're both most like her but that all of us (9 AGs so far, 3 MACs, two MT Cuddlies, 2 BABs, etc.) all share different parts of her personality and favorite things, etc.  Some things a few of us share and others only one of us might share...and then we all have differences from her, too, but it's different for all of us as to how diffrent or alike we are to her and each other.

Anyway, my favorite movies are Balto, A Little Princess, Curly Top, Captain January, My Little Pony the Movie, Land Before Time and Shiloh.  I also love the book of Shiloh.  

I'm not sure what else to write so I guess I'll stop here.

"event","Ack!  We're stuck in Missy's Theatre Professor's office!  And we can't get out!  I, uh, used my dollie magic and somehow got onto his computer to write this, hehe.  But...Missy forgot us!!!!!!!!!!!!  She left us in her professor's office, after her project was done, and never came and got us afterward :(  She said she was going to!  Mischa and I were having fun exploring and everytime the professor's back was turned away from us, I stuck out my tongue and stared all wide-eyed and made Mischa giggle!  But then Mischa and I were chatting and the next thing we knew, the light was shut-off (Mischa and I managed to get it back on) and the door was locked!  We're stuck here all night!  This is awful; how could Missy forget us?  How?  Did we do something wrong?  Was she just forgetful?  Did she just not have any time?  And does her professor even realize we're still in here?  This is awful!

Or...maybe if just means...BOOK FORT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Oh, yes, there are many weird books in here and I plan to make a fort with them all.  Mischa says she'll help.  Which, btw, she arrived last night.  She says she'll write an intro when we're back with Missy.  I think she's starting to cry a bit b/c we're stuck here.  She seems a bit sensitive but not as much as Susie or Missy.  Close, though.  She told me she loves competition but hates losing and sometimes thinks she's not good enough when she loses at something...

Anyway, so I'm going to write to the theatre prof. and try to cheer Mischa up.  I'm strong.  Plus, this could be a adventure-I mean, how many other dolls are locked in their owners' professor's office?  I don't think many are.

"event","Monday was my birthday and I got my doll as a big surprise!  I had no idea I was getting her and was bummed because we were having a tea-er juice-party and I had to borrow a stuffed animal from Kirsten because all my dolls and stuffed animals were at home.  I love my new doll so much!  I certainly wasn't planning on getting anything, really.  Now my doll just needs her sister (I have the new version now, so I want the old version still).  I just can't get over how beautiful she is and I love that her gown matches my Christmas gown!  I also got a necklace and pen from Grandlinda's dolls: Samantha, Nellie, Bridget, Jenny, Molly and Emily.

I was working on helping Missy finish sewing for her project that's due tomorrow and we didn't finish until 5am!  No wonder I don't like learning to be a gentlewoman!  'Tis so hard to sit still for a long time and sew tiny stitches like that.  But now Missy just has to finish some sketches and then dress Kirsten for modeling one of the outfits.  She also hopes that that Mischa girl will come tonight b/c her roommate said that once the sewing was done, she could get Mischa.  I still don't want to meet Mischa, of course, but I guess it's too late and I can't really help it.  Let's see if Mischa actually comes today.  Missy says she'll be wicked ticked off at her roommate if she doesn't give her Mischa b/c she said she would once the sewing was done and Missy really wants Mischa to help model.  I'd model but Missy plans to leave Kirsten and hopefully Mischa in her theatre professor's office after the presentation, because doesn't want to bring them to her other classes.  And she doesn't want anything to happen to anyone but I'm most special so get to stay here.  Plus I'm already dressed for AGPNY!  And it's a hassle with my shift and my dress.  So it'll either be Kirsten and Mischa modeling tomorrow or just Kirsten.  Kirsten doesn't mind either way and says she plans to build a book fort or something nerdy like that...  I certainly hope Missy's professor doesn't mind.  She told us that she asked him about it and he laughed a bit when she mentioned Kirsten's plan.  It is rather amusing, I must admit.  

Anyway, I need more sleep.  Late nights and I do not work.  And I'm done sewing.*

*okay, I have to sew a sampler sometime and do more icky, boring sewing...but I <i>wish</i> I was done sewing.  I so hate sitting down kinds of things.  I need a roof to climb, Penny to ride and a shop to help out in.  Fences to walk across...adventure!  I need adventure!

"event","Yay oh yay!  In two weeks Missy graduates college and we'll head for NYC and home!  Felicity, Samantha (who is at home), and I are all excited for AGPNY!!!!!!!  We're meeting Kit there and she'll be coming home with us.  Missy won't say what else she's getting at AGPNY but she says most of it will be for Kit and Mischa.  Mischa has to get her access. and 2-in-1 skating outfit; and Kit her birthday dress since her birthday is next month.  And mine is in June!  

At the moment, Felicity and I are helping Missy sew costumes for her tech theatre project.  She says us sewing is helping keep her sane.  I think she just doesn't want to do all the work herself.  I mean, I've got other chores to do-and homework!  I've got a rug to braid and crocheting for Jess' and my shop...and lots more.  But all I can do is sew for Missy's project.  Is there any way I can tell her prof. about her making Lissie and I sew for HER project?  Hmmm...he might think that she wrote it and then call her crazy...oh well.  She is crazy-for making US sew for HER!  She also says that I should help because she got me my quilt, and I get to model one of the costumes and stuff.  I am excited about that.  I so hope Mischa gets here in time to model, too.  I'm dying to meet her but Missy's roommate keeps saying she's going to wait until graduation for Mischa to get here.  What about me?  I want to meet Mischa now!  I wouldn't mind modeling the costume alone but depending, Missy might see if I (and Mischa if she's here in time) can spend some time in her prof.'s office while she goes off to classes right after that...and I wouldn't want to have to sit in the office alone.  Unless...maybe I can build a book fort!  Or something nerdy that a doll can do in a academic office.  Yes!  That would make my day...or...I could draw a picture on her prof.'s computer if there's a paint program!  Sweet!  I may have fun with this.  Heck, if Mischa comes in time, then it'll be double the fun!  (or Missy'll just not let us anywhere near her prof.'s office...either way :) )

Monday we're having a small tea party with our dolls/stuffed animals, for Felicity's birthday-technically we probably will have juice b/c Lissie is a Patriot and doesn't drink tea.  She says she doesn't like tea anyway.  She has to borrow a stuffed animal since all her dolls and stuffed animals are at home.  Rilla, me and Hallie all put our money together to get something for Lissie.  I hope she likes her present-we picked out something really special!

ps.  Unfortunately I can't visit Jenny and her dolls next month.  So my traveling will begine in June.  I'm going to a Swedish festival and will get to visit Violet in UT and visit Lindsey and Anya, too!  I can't wait!"

"event","Missy will be home in a little over two weeks!  That means Kit and Mischa will be here soon, too, and Kirsten and Felicity and Rilla and Hallie will be back home also!  I can't wait!  

In school, we have this project we have to do.  Well...it's a research paper, actually and I'm doing mine on Bengal tigers.  It's supposed to be 3 pages typed.  We have two and half weeks to do it but it's split into when notecards are due, rough draft and final draft.  And Mrs. Halliwell is going to have a confrence with each of us individually about our papers, after each part is due-yikes!  I don't want to know how badly I might do on the parts (I'm hoping I do well, but I'm not good with papers at all.  I like stories but sometimes I can't really finish stories I start...)  

We also have another project coming up next month, that is supposed to be fun but we don't know anything about it yet.  I hope it'll be easy!  

There isn't much else going on but since I probably won't really have time to update this week, I'll post a Happy Early birthday to Felicity (4/21).  And happy belated birthday, Sara!!!!!!!!!!!!  I hope you had a fun day!

"event","Like others, Missy hasn't had much time for us lately.  The only time she has for us is when she makes us help her sew for her project.  It's annoying!!!!!!  I hate sewing.  

Oh, by the way, I forgot to post that I am in NC as Grandlinda and I had planned for me to be mailed here as a surprise a few weeks ago.  Missy was quite surprised and told me never to go through the mail again (I don't want to anyway, so it's all good).  Grandlinda mostly wanted to make sure I wouldn't be forgotten when she comes down next month, since AGPNY is before we get home.  

Mischa still isn't here.  Which is good.  I <i>don't</i> want to meet her.  I hate her-and I've never even met her!  Kirsten keeps thinking Mischa and I will become the best of friends but I highly doubt it.  And she better keep her grubby little hands off my DB/Jareth!  He's MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (and Missy's, Molly's and Jenny's).

Mischa will probably be here before the 24th, which is when Missy's project is due and she's not toting me around for it since I'm so special.  Only Kirsten and Mischa will be modeling costumes.  

I'm bored.  There isn't much else to write and Missy says I have to get offline b/c she's ""wicked"" busy and stuff like that.  Maybe someone from home will have more interesting things to write.

P.S.  Thank you for the party favors, Lindsey!!!!!  They're awesome!  We're giving the diary and pen to...Mischa...it's Kirsten's idea...the slinkies are fun!  and the lollipops-yum!"

"event","Happy Easter aka Peep Season (Missy said she got that from the Ivy book author's blog b/c it's funny and she even friended the Ivy author so she can see more of the interesting posts*), everyone!  I had a cool one-filled with some peeps-Missy let me eat the pink chicks-yay pink!

My Samanthina doll went missing earlier; but I found out what happened to her.  It's in this album for all you to see (along with peepy pictures!):

*Also, the Ivy book author has a stuffed Peep that she takes everywhere with her since she's a huge Peeps fan and the stuffed Peep, Peepy, always has her photo taken everywhere.  She travels in a way, with her owner.  That's like us.  So it's another reason why our big people shouldn't be afraid to take us everywhere-if famous people can take toys/plushies around and take photos anywhere, without a second though, our owners can take us anywhere and take photos  (or if they really don't want to take us somewhere, they can take *our* dolls (aka, mini AGs, Sari, Ida Bean, etc.).

Now I want a Peepy.  and so does Missy.  We both love Peeps although both of us can't eat more than two or 3 in a sitting.  But they're so fun to cook in a microwave!!!!!!!

"event","I can't believe Missy went ahead with getting Mischa, after all my complaints!  She says she won't love Mischa more than me, but she hasn't met Mischa yet.  She probably will fall all in love with her and forget all about me.  'Tis horrible!

Anyway, lessons are boring as normal.  I have to start a sampler soon but I've no clue what to make.  'Tis ever so hard and annoying.

So we've all heard here that Mischa is officially coming.  Felicity is still upset about that even though she knows Missy will still love her most.  We all keep trying to tell her that but she doesn't ever listen.  I hope she realizes it soon and that she and Mischa will become great friends!

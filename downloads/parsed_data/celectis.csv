A few things to know before friending <lj user=""celectis"">:

+I'm usually only updating doodles and pchat drawings.
+I love tons of stuff but am not always active in fandom!
+This journal is very <b>B</b>oy<b>L</b>ove friendly!
+Perverted but does not always draw hardcore!
+Will probably say tons of useless, dumb stuff. ;D
+Loves it when you comment

+ By friending me here, you're agreeing to not reposting any of my art elsewhere without my approval/claiming that you drew it/trolling/etc.

I'm pretty laid back <s>and a pushover</s> so I hope to be getting to know you all! x3 

Please comment here when adding!

Some drawr stuff! The suikoden art was from a thread started by <lj user=""fightfair"">. <a href=""http://drawr.net/show.php?id=471378"">YOU SHOULD JOIN TOO.</a>

<img src=""http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e186/Celectis/lol.jpg"">
This is from an oc session with Endy and Neku. X333 It's kind of been awhile so be nice orz;

<img src=""http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e186/Celectis/cainabelwtf.jpg"">
REALLY OLD OC1 ART. If you can't tell, they're Cain and Abel (badly drawn) from Starfighter haha.

<img src=""http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e186/Celectis/fifipicturecopy.jpg"">
Something I did with a mouse at school while I waited for my maya crap to render. (It never rendered properly though!) It's Fifi and her apple she named in neku's honor lol.

<img src=""http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e186/Celectis/feefturnaround.jpg"">
A Fifi turn around I did quickly...a few hours before class. I BAD GIRL. orz;;;

<img src=""http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e186/Celectis/conceptsketches.jpg"">
And some more colored sketches...so um.
</lj-cut>
<b>If I offered color sketch commissions just like the one above for about <s>15</s>10 dollars, would any of you be interested? ;;;</b> Hahah.

EDIT// LOL I didn't say much through this post except bombard you with art! What's wrong with meeee. Anyway, hi, how are you guys? I've been kind of busy with school...making a senior animation, in 3d...it's really kind of dumb and embarrassing so I rather not go in detail beyond that....but I've been working on that and when not doing that, wasting my time on that drawr thread because suikoden was awesome and I wasted days during my break playing it. Kind of sad I dont have time to beat it now because ENDY WHO STARTED LATER THAN ME BEAT IT ALREADY...but i'll live. /sob. I kind of need the commission monies to make up for a bad purchase (LOL YOU DONT WANT TO KNOW BUT IT'S SUIKODEN RELATED) and for a DSi...*SHOT*...AND for other stuff. Yeahhh 15 dollars per commissi--..15 dollars?! Em *fixes* I meant 10 but wrote 15, I mean 10 dollars per drawing isn't going to get me anywhere fast, but I think it's a good punishment for being dumb. *shot again* So yeah...now you have a block of text. *sobs*"

D: So um...my computer died again...and this time it took a huge plunge. Orz;;; Called an order for the recovery disk because my computer didn't come with one...and uh..that'd gonna be here by wednesday. 8DD LOL. THATS WHEN MY MAYA IS DUE HAHAHAHAHAHfuckrs. :( ...damn you amerikan holeyday! orz;;; Especially since we don't get that day off...*sobbles*

So yeah...working at the lab now. Probably for the best since if I were to work at home I'd be playing and not really........uh....wait....lol. I'm doing that here too. Hahahaha. *sweat*;;

My procrastination powers...they be great. (OVER 9000!!! D: No. It never gets too old!)

D:> Not only that...I got two packages waiting for me that I can't wait to pick up on monday...and then I wonder if they'd be open on monday. Afterwards I started to discuss (With myself of course) why it should be open and if they're not open why I'd be justified to stare through their glass doors angrily. FEEL MY HOT BREATH GLASS. FEEL IT.

I also played Wild Arms 5 all day Saturday. I was sort of kind of supposed to should have been working on my reading journals and/or storyboards...character sheets...but you know...well. THE PINK RANGER IS IN THAT GAME. IN COWBOY BOOTS. And goes bang bang...my roommate didn't stop me. She encouraged me actually. (Damn it. Why does that game have such sexy arts? ; A ;)

Today is Sunday! And I am at the lab! :D ....oh god. My brain is in a messy puddle on the floor right now...oh hay. Lookie...it's a book! ; x ; I wanna read it.

<blockquote>A long long time ago, a dinosaur named Megatron fell in love with a munky named Optimus, however Optimus's Father was a strict man and would not allow his daughter to wed such a hideously fur-less creature. ""Why you don't even -belong- in the same time period as we do!"" Cried the enraged Father Unicron.

Optimus, heart broken by this, decides to become a Truck. ""Then I will rather be hairless as well!"" He screams and runs over his Father in a fit of rage.

Megatron, who later finds out that Unicron was killed by Optimus is delighted and returns to his love's side. ""Oh beloved! We can be together again!""

At this the truck sobs his sorrow. ""Oh Megsy. I haven't thought this through. How can we ever live together like this? I am not even an animal anymore..."" Quickly drying his loves tears with promises of eternal love and return, Megatron travels far and wide so that he too may cast aside his living hide. Many years later he returns as a Jet to Optimus's side.

Optimus, however, was unable to recognize Megatron through the extreme changes. ""I am sorry sir, my love promised me to return to my side as a shiny truck..""

""No no Optimus, I AM MEGATRON.""

""Such a silly person."" With that Optimus walked away and their love was forever unrealized.

THE END.</blockquote>

I'm sorry. I was looking through the energon bar forums trying to figure out if there was anything I could do...and I ended up writing this for the guideline.

SHUT UP. IT'S A WONDERFUL FORUM GUIDELINE.

such dismay! and the weathermen stand blindly in front of their blue screens and teleprompters, under panels of drywall! stop the cameras and give me some more novacaine = nova-cocaine= ""new"" cocaine. concentrate sam, i brainstormed. my mind always had trouble with settling down to one task or thought proccess. with my legs burning and my hands shivering, i decided i would look down at the road underneath me. oh, dear troublesome fate. so recklessly true, my feet were gone. no longer in tact. i was just scrapping my legs on the graded cement. if i made it too the bridge in time, i could make my way back following the trail of red i was leaving. my sludging shins torched on throught the wet. the amount of water the sky bestowed upon me now was so intense, my lungs were getting wet, as well as my veins. it got harder and harder to breathe. my lung space was running out. to believe i would be consumed by fire once im done, quite worried my friend one day. well ol friend, my dross and ashes might make way up past those clouds to you one day. with each new forward motion the bridge became more visibily apparent. the correlation of the pain on my bleeding kneecaps and the size of the bridge depently increased! i was wearing nearer and closer. the immense burning and bleeding underneath me started a familiar feeling. i grew accustom to the sensation and the pain seemed to fall asleep. so i ketpgoing.&nbsp; go. obstacles endured me. mailboxes to my perifrials houses shouting trees spitting. stop whispering i shouted! zealously struggling to get to the bridge, oh how i have always dreamed of accomplishing its high altitudes, lie in the sad fatigue of idleness. i was so close now i could taste the concrete. the aluminum fencing began to kiss my toungue. i could distinguish its characteristics. grey walkway. towering up in a 30 foot slab overhanging the busy highway. soaking wet dripping, looked wounded and begged to me for a blanket, or possibly an umbrellla. the cars below slicked and scurried by like ants in fear of the deterioration of their homelands.&nbsp; i was so near! i felt i could touch it! i noticed my hand still raised perpendicular to my body and tried to grab the bridge. i was maybe about a foot off. but suddenly i couldnt move any closer. the trauma was unbearable; i viewed down to the end of the street where i remained, and noticed i had no more legs. i had worn them down almost completely. such tradgedy in the final submission.i slumped over and crashed onto the asphalt. i tried to roll on my side to make it the final distance to the bridge, but i was far too exhausted. in the summit of my stress and endurement, my bleeding body, the resting on the puddle-conquered street was quite comforting. i turned onto my back and faced the sky, squinting to ward off the rain from stinign my eyeballs. the grey mass of cloud and weather slowly rolled by from which millions of dropletts parachuted down to land on my skin and crumble. i thought about the atrophy so intensly, i, myself started to feel the excitement in falling from the heights to topple down into peices. following my brieft resting and refreshing, i folded my arms in to my sides, and rolled right onto the bridge. up and up i went. i could taste the concrete i could smell the cars beneath. so peacefully noisy/&nbsp; and so secretley conspicuous. i had never reached such a success in my entire lifetime. after all i had lived, all i had gone through just to be within this very moment. i reached the midpoint of the bridge. i streched my arms out and layed, again, on my back facing the sky. my arms severely damaged. calloused and battered. but everyting was ok. suddenly i felt a great rumble. the concrete began convulsing. everyhting became amplified thousands of times louder than before. the bridge began cracking, and dust began to rise from the floor like smoke. i continued to lay there, in awe, as the bridge begun its collapse. i feared for the cars below. i felt pity for the constructors of the magnificent looking overpass, for they might feel now as if they have failed. the cement holding my body soon began to cave in with the rest of the destruction. my dream was crippling like an old man at the end of his life. heartattack. the bridge was simply suffering a heart attack. the feeling of falling down from these height returned, this time for correct than ever. the rain ceased to drop onto my face, because now i was dropping right allong side to all of them. i looked sideways, they looked at me, i looked the other way and they looked at me too. that faceless expression. worry? fear? content. i knew what they though and they knew what i thought. i had never connected with anything so well that day as i did with the falling rain. everyonce in a while we woudl look down at the street getting larger and larger and closer and colder. the peices of cement broke apart in midair. i heard cars screeching tires to avouid the large boulders. there was honking and crashing. i was near the street now, i turned to the rain and said
goodnight.

"event","well i took the overcast, right from the heavens wings, and placed it underneath my pillow. the next day i found nothing but torn up notes and an empty syringe with your written on each item. i dreamt the previous night of watching the sidewalks melt into mountains. im sure there werent any oceans involved. to be young and in love, well ive got the love part down, but its getting pretty old. these days, i figure, the only time the phone ever rings is when the cord is wrapped snugly around my hands. and each one of my fingers would turn blue like how i drink my disshwasher fluid. no not chlorox. and i take great notation on such adornments. necklace, 19 of them====praising! all at once; if i were a lesser mortal i would have greater privledge. if i were the least mortal, i would have the most privledge. but the higher one organisms intellegence the higher the stress, responsiblity, worry, obligation(to survive maybe decide) and nightmares. while resting my body upon this certain grey+ red +sophisticated chair, which i was uneasily able to obtain sanction over,&nbsp; my attention was called to the carpet below. beigeish tan in colour. textured sloppily like hundreds or yarn fragments glued to a moorr. glued to a morgue?            hello? i asked politely and the carpet made no reply. hello. again. nothing. by this time i was overwhelmed by confusion and despair. i spoke again, this time in a more wilted and stressed tone. ""hello"" i proclaimed! oh the guilt was wrenching up my liver like a case of cold needles digesting themselves into my esophogus. finally the beige plain of mossy polyester whispered its anticipated response. ""hello"". the releif poured down my spine. the relief poured down my throat. the releif poured and kept on pouring. ""what should i do?"" i replied anxiously. i felt another needle find comfort in my stomach. ""you must find a tool' said the carpet floor. i thought in my mind brain. tool tool toool, instrument? application! drug. tool! hammer? no. sewing machine? i dont know. i will ask. i will ask the carpet what he means. what kind of tool i will ask him. i will. im sure i will. ""what kind of tool, what exactly do you mean, sir?"" i questioned. slowly the words came clear of which it spoke. they jumped up and crawled&nbsp; into the sides of my face. ""the tool which ties your mental processes directly and constructively into your physical soma and existance."" hmmm my brain flashed camera lenses and photographs. there was cultivation of the time spectrum=whcih i was unwillingly strought amongst. will this tool explain the whereabouts- the edges- of the spectrum? if we can predict the futuress, surely we must be able to predict the pasts. the backbone of my burdens now rested opon the wisdom of my carpet., i spun the chair around. seven. rotations. how many rotations did our universe rely on? well damnit, why havent we relied on it to supply us with rotations. why did everythign have to keep changing, yet eternally remaining the same. ""can you explain this one?!"" i begged the carpet! in the midst of spinning in my aching chair i once pondered collapsing from its high altitude and&nbsp; parading my body onto the vast floor in which i indulged upon, wisdom! compainionship. conversation. ""there are two possibilies for the spectrum of existance. the line and the circle. both of which have no beginning and no end; however the line allows for progress and possiblity. perhaps the past can not be seen in its infinite direction nor has any effect on the future stretching in the opposite path. mathematical equations can only tell us how far it will never end, never?; consequently, time being theorized in a circle, leaves no choice to the existor in its existance. time will descend like a clock only turning in its own circumference. like a carousel of pictures and numbers. doomed to drag and repeat itself. time repeats . past repeats. it circles on and on, sam. it never ends. the future repeats. the past will soon be the future and the future will soon be the past."" i felt a great deal of dizziness upon the enlightenment from below. i spoke in return with my eyes dampening.""which one is the correct notion?"" oh please please please what is happenening to me. why did the floor decide to inform me on the fate of the air i breathe! why must i be the sultan to the higher knowledge of in which we existt! such is life!? ""they are both indeed correct."" oh sweet disease please consult me to your sypathy. i see myself through a glass of stale water. the molecules slowly tear my image but mend me after they have left. the tan carpet which held the my chair(now my colour) could sense and absorb my lament. ""it is up to you to choose between the two."" the chair ceased its rotation. i ceased my rotation. my blood still kept spinning, as did my teeth. i lost the will to hold on to the sitting device. id rather lay down. on my new freind. its kind of itchy on my face. not too hot not too cold. thanks for your love. hide the hour glass!

thats what i said. goodnight."

"event","during my breif slumber on the sidewalk, which was cauterized by many different theta and delta waves, images of an old man batting his arms around in the darkness of his room. wearing an old sleeping robe. and a pair of slippers. the man was frightened. possibly by the darkness or possibly by his confusion with everything. he began crying and calling out his sons name. jonathan. he had insufferably outlived his only son, and his wife, helen. these nights went by and these nights were very hard for him. all he had left was a dark room, in a quiet house. not even the sun graced his presence. the words jonathan, and helen, rung loudly in his brain and made him so sick of the darkness. i was so sick of the darkness when i awoke from the dream. i discovered myself in a completely different place. my eyes could barely open still. glued around. the concrete sidewalk that once held me was now a bed of carpet. stickly warm carpet. beige polyester. as the pictures, questions, and words ran together like paint and water, i realized the carpet was my carpet. the house was my house. somehow i had ended up back at home. oh god, i felt, why did everythign have to keep changing so abruptly. i grew sick on my ability to pull myself up from the carpet, in the queit living room. i trudged to the bathroom and threw up water. once again. i scolded the television i plead shame on the couches. thirty days seems so long. ive never felt like such a period of time could be so anticipating. i wonder if i ever thougth how short time could be. time is everything. a burning fuse that goes on and on but,, there are no ashes behind, only photographs and memories, and there is no slack ahead only hopes and fears. i signed my name on my fuse and the letters are short. all six of them. i signed away my fuse into the hands of the grey building. i thought gladly how the script which read my existance was free from my demise. the pen had been handed over. i had no idea what time it was, nor what day it was. but it was the first day. i found the kitchen. i fixed myself a glass of warm water. i set the glass on the table while grasping a knife and making a small insicion on my left arm. one.

"event","there is a reason for all of this. it happens to be lost. only read this is you are very bored. or very messed up in the head.

                                                                                      i awoke and found my body resting on the sidewalk. but there was no road. there was no one around.&nbsp; just grass. and a building staring down on me. it was so tall. it seemed to be laughing at me, howd you end up there kid? my shoes were gone. i saw the two black doors in front of me. i noticed their rectangular shape. bed. i wish i had one. i pulled on the handles and as the door opened a pressure change of cool air and hospital smells invited me in. i wasnt quite sure where i was. or how i had arrived. but im sure that will explain itself, like it ever does? i assigned my eyes to the tile floor. i noticed their cubic shape. house. i wish i had one. a forest once told me, when i was in my youth, that grey was the most lamented colour, yet it is so close to white, which is the most heavenly colour. the mesaic peices that puzzled together a sturdy floor, alternated between these two shades. i slowly peered up to gaze around this strange building. the initial breeze which rescued me from the immense heat of my fever, soon turned into a very uncomfortable chill. i held my arms close. i put one hand in my pocket. there were people walking around. they didnt see me, hell knows if they even saw eachother. the faces they wore were more blank than the doors. the clothes they wore were neatly pressed. iron. wash. warm. suit. dress. doctors. nurses. children. all walking around carrying clipboards. sheets of paper were shackled down. oh how i wish i had one. a large open lobby began this building, and gave offspring to roughly seven other doors. which i assume enlosed other rooms. the walls = white, the tables- grey. the hair = blonde. the way the scent of the freezing air and the empty faces and straining colours blended together made me sick. the goosebumps on my arms strangley complimented the beads of sweat creeping down my face. down my cheek like tears. my brain throbbed wiht confusion. and fear. what are these people doing. is this a hospital. what if they notice me standing here? maybe i should sit down. before my thoughts ran together, i heard the words. ""welcome"". two teenage girls appeared standing in front of me. grasping their clipboards. exhibiting their blonde hair spilling over their grey gowns. the comfort of their ironic beauty was both soothing and terryfying. ""what is the reason for all of this?'' i pleaded to them. the ceiling lights were dim and were chopped up by many spinning ceiling fans. ""can you help me.""???&nbsp; they stared in to my face like a telescope. like i was injured. like they were doctors. all i could think about was the fragrance of plastic, plastic chairs. the kind from elementary school. i used to keep my books underneath mine, leo the late bloomer, and a few ghost tales. 
&nbsp; &nbsp;  ""yes, we can help you."" they replied in monotone. they could see right into me. god like girls. ""we know you dont want to be here, we know by the way you cant speak."" i couldnt speak. they stole the words from my throught. i dreamt of water. water. how could i hydrate this throught. the girl on the left easily handed me her clipboard. white and yellow papers. ""okay"" the sound didnt make it quite bast my toungue, but they understood. truley yours. i followed the two of them into another section of this lobby. it seemed to be at the very back of the building. there were plastic chairs. just like elementary school. there were no books beneath. there was a table or a counter... i couldnt tell. it was so blurry in my eyes like they were underwater burning in chlorine. or salt. the blonde haired girls set the clipboard down, gently, on the table. they acted in manners that this was the most important object to them, and for me. its safety might save all of us. i rubbed my eyes red. they were already full of sweat. i noticed my hands were shaking. trembling, i returned them to my arms and i held on so tight. the clipboard sat crooked on the grey plastic countertop like a sacred shrine. it glowed with darkness praying out from the tiny letters scattered evenly acrross each line. creation = destruction. ""go ahead read it. and sign at the bottom."" i followed their orders like a mindless robot. i creeped into the back of my brain and looked out. my body moved and looked at the paper. the words caused to let go of my arms. i let go of my muscles. the sweat in my eyes turned to suprising evaporation. ""this is your way out of here."" they said and i wasnt sure if they were crying or smiling. but this was defenatley the business in this building. i wondered. what kind of hospital is this. theres no white sheets. speaking on behalf ofr starving for this oxygen. lungs held shut.&nbsp; they are always grey. the workers here are blank because of their occupation. they let people like me out of here. they give us a chance to escape the pains of breathing. seeing. feeling. they give us a chance to be free. they find people like me. they know who i am. they always have, and they want me now. they want me here now. by the high amount of people waltzing aroudn the facility i was comforted. maybe i wasnt alone after all. it must be a pretty common thing if there are so many others involved. they cant all be working here just for me. oh what a selfish task. ""how does it work"" i asked. ""its easy"" one of the girls replied. i pulled on my hair a little. i rubbed my eyes wiht my fists again. heres your chance kid. never worry again. this hospital just wanted me to stop worrying. thats what all the grey and white were trying to say all along. they are here to help. i put my hand on the plastic countertop. the surface was almost as cold as the air. and the papers. i grasped the pen. it barely stayed between my fingers. sliding around in&nbsp; my sweaty hands. the letters of my name slowly appeared across the thin line at the bottom of the white paper. the design of a farewell. ink. ""thank you sir"" the girls whispered. ""you have thirty days."" those thirty days were mine. i was given all of them. such a long time i thought. and in all the time i spent thinking inside this facility, the girls escorted me to the back door. i looked back once again at the blank faces walking back and forth over the tiles. pacing is a fashionable sport. the rear exit door was a heavy door. didnt look like it had been used very much. maybe a fire escape. one of the girls put her hand on my shoulder. the other pushed and clicked open the heavy grey metal door. outside it was cloudy and warm. the invitation was fair. outside the door was an alley way. some steps down into it. and some trashcans. i completely exited the strange building. the trashcans and asphat and brick inclosures seeemed lonlier than ever. but it wont be long i told myself. i have plenty of time to do things ive wanted to. do. i can watch the sun go down some more. i can watch the moon crawl across the sky. i can prolly observe waves crashing into sand and wash the shore away. with me. warm sand. maybe i can tell people i love them. but that doesnt make any less of a case. i can make this all less difficult than it shoudl be. nows my chance to tell her. about a thousand sentances flashed through my head then. i just started walking. i found where the bricks ended. i foudn the grass. again. the building still seemed to look down upon my withered body, with great blasphemy. insignifigant was the sidewalk. but it all made sense. i layed back down on the concrete walkway. i rested my head upon my folded arms. my eyelids felt more heavy than the clouds which escaped from me above. i wondered what it would be like up there. floating around. crying on eveyrone. blocking their precious sunlight in the summer. thats when they want it the most. so i can sleep. they can play. why am i so tired i said outloud, silently. to myself. to the gras. to the builiding. to the vacant sky. the sky heard my cry and carried it across the land and dropped it into the ocean. it drowned loudly and i fell asleep. 

i will finish this later. dont worry. there is an ending."

"event","so i have returned to this manuscript of messages. deliberatley plotting out the most unorigional way of explaining what happened to sam, when the sun came up, when the poison and the medicine collided. when the sun died. what is the difference between distance and displaced memory? there is a reason for all of this. there must have been some sort or storm because now my teeth feel like a car crash. just like the tires and broken glass that struck my ears last night, while soaking up some sweet insomnia. its funny how a chemical imbalance can cause you both sleepynes, and insomnia all at once. like being strangled and beat?&nbsp; i crawled from the back door and trudged down the road. my heart racing like the ambulance. and when i arrived to the burning pulsing spinning red and blue lights i saw the fireman. his stroll was slurred. it was slow. there was nothing more to be done. the night had taken its toll. and the job had burned its wages. yea we still go to dinner, but you wont hold my hand. we still sit at the same table, but you dont play wiht my feet. yea we still go to dinner sometimes but we dont sneak a kiss when the waiter turns around. there were too many police cars, ambulance, fire trucks, to see what had happened. something sad. sleep didnt come easy i had to cancel out the suns cry to retain my conciousness. its almost been a year since the last time i typed information in this retarded journal. the old entries well the are old i dont know how much has changed or how much has stayed the same. maybe one is better or one is worse. all i know is that two is better than one. and if i could be two. one would be the water i lived submerged in for half my life, begging a god with no mouth and no lungs to grant me air. starvation is cruel when the appetite is for oxygen. they will stop holding my lungs shut. they will let go of me. i will stare at the surface as i float to its sugary silk gown. the soul will have already left. but i will reunite with heaven=her arms. well now that i have rambeled on for quite a few minutes. you wont want to read more of this. im promising you too much. whoever you are. i love you. goodnight. said sam to you."

"event","i am pasted on the floor like a collage of vintage materials that have been used, thought abotu being thrown out but kept for the possiblitly of having some some meaning or some use, none 

existed so they are thrown about a paperboard. for the amusment of ones eyes. they must be dull., the eyes must be gray or blind. covered in cucumbers. ranch dressing. i feel like i have sat outside freeezing under the night for hours. i feel like someone stabbed me a thousand times wihtout telling me why. i feel liek my best freind told me a horrible goodbye and left forever. never to return. i feel as it i burried myself under a glacier and 
am pulling my skin over like a raincoat. i feel like my soul left me. i feel like my body left me. all thats left are these worthless fingers. straining the very veins supplying them alcohol to write these sounds. i just returned from a house, of one my very good friends. a lot of my freinds were in attendance. the parents were gone.  it was party time i drank excesivley like usually out of sadness and stupidity. i once again found myself slipping away, collaterally wiht my sobriety, cluttered in tight rooms with too many people too much noise too much love too much air too much beauty. i once again loooked for a more quiet room where no one would findm me. i shoudl 
have just gone to the root beer kegger. unfortunatley you hear more when im drunk liek this. im sorry. you will get no plot today. but i will tell about last night. friday we went to the show. mike 

scary acoustic, sedona, alli wiht an i, and conshafter. conshafter played first. i met the singer and talked to him a bit befroe they play and got real stoked to hear them he was a really cool guy and 
he told me i woudl love thier music. so i stood in front. suporting my new freind. i felt sad as they sucked horribly. they werent together at all. they sounded liek some late 80s punk ramones wannabees. they tripped oveer their chords, the singer kept dropping his mic, and they kept messing up to wher ei wcoudl tell. i felt so bad for not liking them, but everyoen has different tastes. since i am sympathetic i continued to stand, being the only one stading in front, smiling and pretending to be into their music. after the show i shook the singer, chris's, hand told him he did an excellent job and he looked sad because he knew no one liked their music, but he smiled and 
told me thanks for being the only person standing in front suporting them. i never saw him again the whoel night i belive they left and went on their way. i love them because they dont strike me as good musicians but they totally are doign what they love and thats what is pretty abotu their ugly performance. dont worry im not a hater haha and i do not enjoy criticising. but when mike scary played, it was amazing made my heart cry. the rest of the bands were good. during sedona i went in the back and sat in the corner. i noticed another girl sitting in the corner next to me as well. we began speech she introduced her sefl to me. i was startled by her flirtiness and she was 
quite attractive so it kind of freaked me out. her eyes were blue not like a sky but like the bottom of an ocean deeper than the highest mountain there is there was so much behind those eyes and i knew by peering into them. but we talked for a long time. and she told me great 
things and i hope i told her great things too. turns out she was liek 21 or somethign and thought i was too. when she found out i was 17 her flirtiness turned into oh how cute an adorable little boy. 

but we continued our in depth conversation, ive never really opened up as i did to a person i had never met before. she gave me good advice and told me she was glad she met me. as she left  i said to her, you are an amazing individual and i hope you have a wonderful ngiht. i hope you do to. goodnight im pasing out.  said sam to you"

"event","so the day begun wiht an exteneded morning, i got to sleep in an extra hour today. it was good except when my father was yelling at me through my locked door.
school went ok. the silence went on making it much worse on me and my eyes as they glue themselves to the floor so i wont look up. i cant look up. id be lying if i said i wasnt tired. 
i am glad tomorow is friday finally. ok you will get no more of this. continue anitplot please:

<i>she staggered like drunk off cotton candy waking up far too early this day. she tripped over the mindless objects scattered on her carpet. but she sunk her toes in when there was a free patch and rubbed them into the warm shaggy grass. she ripped her left bare foot up in an instance of a crack and blood. the crunch below her foot left a ringing in her head and the crunch below her foot left a crimson liquid to spill from her heel. a tear easily slid off her cheek onto the golden carpet. she wept because her eyes coudl no longer focus. she had crunched the best pair, the only pair of glasses she wore. since she was young they were like a mother to her, showing her direction, showing her words and pictures and letting them absorb wholly into her natural green eyes. the spectacles were timeless and time was no longer available for them. she fell to the ground picking up the peices in her hands. some peices painted in her blood liek it was their own. the peices miserably fell through her fingers like sand, like dying flowers ,like beign blown away in the wind impossible to chase after or puzzle back together. she took the one black hook which had been used to hold these glasses upon her left ear, and placed it in her jean pocket. she caughed, and got up to the bathroom. she glanced in the mirror. her eyes seemed blistered and red. lines cut across her face. the skin was distorted and her hair seemed to fall like wires. she sheeked around in disgust and fright. nicole crawled to her closet and put on a blue knit sweater. the one her father gave her before he sailed off on a large vessle into some other country, as he was going to support a land of blue market shemes, years of white suppremacy, and red blood of opposing countries. she wore the sweater multiple times during the week. she was attached to the article as much as a friend could be, he kept her warm and she felt a sense of beauty while in the sweater. after confidently squeezing into her clothes, she ran to her telephone. the way the light beamed off the glass of her window reflecting star shapped radials on the phone she took into account. she dashed in the numbers star sixty nine. she turned off the phone in dissapointment when the voice churned out 673. the numbers nicole wanter were 846.  the possiblity was far off anyways. the word hunger sprung into her perifial. she thought of treading all the way down stairs in her weary and dissoriented blindness. making her way into the bathroom again, she pulled on the mirror and it popped open exposing her toothbrush and bottle of pills. the pills werent of her own perscription but she obtained them from a familiar freind. after a few of the small white and orange capsuls, she stared out her glass window paine. she noticed the scenery like televison trees. the autumn bell had rung in mind as the lemon leaves fell onto cinnamon spruce and tangarine oak. all to die and convine on a suttle ground but perfectly like a persuasive finger painting. </i>"

"event","i would retreat if i could. the voices and sounds of today continue their incessant ringing. today felt like six years had passed from the time i opened my eyes to the time i opened my mouth.  ive longed to sleep all day. i slept first pd in my car. what a wonderful slumber. i slept again once i came home from school. nothing was accomplished today, yet not much was destroyed. maybe brain cells. perkiset. something about it makes me want to sleep forever, but good sleep it would be. the kind which you can open your eyes and feel warm but not know who you are or where you are and could dont care at all to know or find out. this nonsense is hurting my eyes. i will begin a plot. and try to continue for you to be entertained maybe. lines begin at zero.

<i>so the sunlight had been flying all night. like a jet around the earth. soaring high and higher as the other side slept. but once it noticed the moon trailing around, it knew it was time. time to fall. time for light to crash down below the clouds. outshine all darkness and all the stars. the light swam through the valleys, and forests. through cars and mailboxes. and finally burst into nicoles window. it broke through the glass like a train derailing into a golden stream saturated in morning. like a warm blanket it fell upon her soft skin. she cracked her eyes and began to breathe. she didnt know where she was or who she was and quite frankly she did not want to find out. the first thing she noticed was a landscape of cotton, a prarie of blankets and pillows. the grass was white and blue, the break of sky seemed miles away showing three walls. a short river extended some bit, but trailed back to the edge of her cheek where it deposited into a tearpool that had formed the previous night. some dreams cause rain to fall. she turned up gazing on a white stucco plain. she heard the wet black tires of the seven am busses slick by outside on the road. she imagined a horse drawn carriage. two white stallions. a caddy carried two beautiful people. the woman in the carriage was wearing a long white dress. long black hair spilled over her shoulders like chocolate silk. she easily had her head rested upon the mans shoudler. the man kept himself ina stiff black suit. nicole knew she loved him by the way her apple eyes peered up and met his but she was not sure he returned the feeling. his eyes sunk back like cold and black and they stared out past the horses, past the peach pebble road past the horizon- into his soul. nicole turned so she coudl see the floor cluttered in laundry and trash and empty bottles. nicoles thoughts began to flow together now, she remebered names and places. it was wednesday. ""i am closer"" she whispered to herself. she moved her leg, placing it upon the ground and pulled the hot blankets over to the wall. she thought how waking up can feel worse than death in which you would feel nothing at all.   </i>"

"event","so i guess it has been a while since ive said anything. silence is generated when words make their way up my throught but drown in my mouth. sorrryy.

well so over the past week ive slept and skipped some school and took action in other self destructive situations

yet last weekend there was delight, i traveled to charlotte wiht my best friends and got to see coheed and cabria, thrice, and thursday. my oh my what a show. i was nearly crushed during thrice, but i weeded my way out of the packed mass of sweaty faces to a nice and suttle seat upstairs in good view. i am glad i was blessed enough have the time i did. still sad that i couldnt afford the organ at goodwill. :(

so i broke it off, and we arent going to talk. its going to be hard for me. i hope i make it through the time to come. because time sure is coming for me.

such a night, i greeted my best freind upon the bridge that sacred place thats so desert and so peaceful and smells of fresh concrete like ice cream. and in the perfect ability to percieve whatever paintings the night spills to construct above. so we talked for at least two hours, great in depth conversation just how i like it. nothin can cheer you up like a long chat with a best friend.

why is it that when you are searching you will never find it.

well my fingers can sculpt no longer this rambling and irrelevant documentation of sams day, im going to go look for my appetite, its been mispalced for quite some time. pills and wine wont always keep me going. i should sleep after all this work. goodnight"

"event","is time really everything? well all i have is time to direct me to where i shall go. 

today is sunday and that means inside, tired, gazing out the window into something beautiful such as a moor or a tree of some sort.

i woke up quite early today. i ate a microwaved chickfila sandwhich, not half as tasty as they are fresh. 

i am still grounded, but i pray that i will still be allowed to eat dinner at moes tonight. i eat there every sunday night. it keeps me alive. for my parents to take away such a delight would be no worse than making me drink bleach. <i>welcome to moes!!!!!!!!!!!</i>

so i was saved last night by my friend bradley, we escaped to the bridge and hung out a while at like 2am. we watched the sky roll by as well as headlights below. they could have just been reflections, whos to tell.
he even brought me some yuengling. lis was supposed to join us, but she sold out and went to sleep. sorry lis.

i am strong and i am proud in that i did not call her today. rock sam rock.

hopefully next weekend will be one of better events, freedom, possibly i will party with my friends, and make new ones.

school has its hooks in me. deep

rake them why not wait until the spring and rake them all.

down to chapel hill and saw an amazing alli with and i and

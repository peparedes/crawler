What she doesn't know will kill you


by Matt Brochu
November 21, 2003



You met her a few months ago, and somehow she managed to seep into your subconscious like that ""Suga how you get so fly"" song. Just like you have no clue who the hell sings it, you don't know why she's there. But she is, whether you like it or not. You know her cell phone, her room phone. You can dial her Aunt Doreen's house in West Springfield (where she goes to do her laundry every two weeks) faster than you can peck-out 911. But she doesn't know.

Her screenname, that generic one with her first name followed by three to five random numbers or UMass, has its own category at the top of your buddy list. Not only do you know what a ""Buddy Alert"" is, you've rigged your computer to play ""Fat Guy in a Little Coat"" from ""Tommy Boy"" every time her screen name changes from gray to black. Then her away message comes down, and you have a decision to make. To IM or not to IM? These are the ridiculous games that you play on a daily basis. But she doesn't know.

She's it. All right, so maybe not ""it"" it. Not necessarily Ms. Right, but closer to Ms. Right-up-there-with-Anna-Kournikova-and-Lizzie-McGuire-on-your-list-of-people-you'd-give-anything-to-be-stranded-with-on-a-broken-down-elevator. But it's about more than that. When is it ever about more than that? Never. Not like frilly white dress, overpriced catering, embarrassing drunk in-laws more, but closer to UMass sweatpants, two D.P. Dough Roni Zonies, a futon and a movie you have no interest in seeing more. But she doesn't know.

She's gorgeous, but gorgeous is an understatement. More like you're startled every time you see her because you notice something new in a ""Where's Waldo"" sort of way. More like you can't stop writing third grade run-on sentences because you can't remotely begin to describe something ... someone ... so inherently amazing. But you're a writer. You can describe anything. That's what you do: pictures to words, events to words, words to even better words. But nothing seems right. More like you're afraid that if you stare at her for too long, you'll prove your parents right: that yes, your face will stick that way. But you wouldn't mind.

You wouldn't mind that the questioning, ""Hello?"" on the other end makes you want to smile and throw up at the same time. You wouldn't mind worrying about what to get her for her birthday and spending $300 when you only have $17.50 and a Triple-A card to your name. You wouldn't mind that she left your TV on and the blaring infomercials wake you up at 4 a.m. ... because it gives you a chance to watch her sleep. You don't mind that you've slipped up twice when you were hammered and hinted at how you feel, but she was too drunk to remember. So she doesn't know.

Sure, she's pretty, but it's about more than that. You two connect. Anything you throw at her, she can throw right back. You figured out what's going on in that predictable head of hers in under five minutes, but something tells you her heart would take about five years.

You remember everything she's ever said to you, and when that freaks her out you blame it on your photographic memory (which is a lie, you have a 2.7 GPA). You can't remember your teaching assistant's name, and you can't remember that your Puffton rent check was due four days ago, yet you remember the middle name of the kid who tripped her in fifth grade and gave her that cute little scar on her shoulder. Maybe it's because you actually listen when she talks. When do you actually listen? Never. But she doesn't know.

But she has a boyfriend. The kid is a tool, and you are not. He has no redeeming qualities, and you have about 38, even when you're hung over. You could kick his butt, and you've never been in a fight in your life. He treats her like crap, and you would treat her like the princess she believed herself to be on Halloween in 1988.

But she loves him. He wouldn't know what he had even if she slapped him across the face and dumped him, but somehow she still loves him. And somehow she still doesn't know.

Then, out of nowhere, she slaps him across the face and dumps him. She comes to you. You've been there before, so you seem like the smartest guy on earth. She cries, but your corny half-joke, half-compliment somehow gets a smile out of her that almost makes you feel ashamed that you're the only one around who gets to witness it. It looks like you might make her realize that all guys don't deserve to have rocks thrown at them.

But nothing changes. She doesn't know. You get that library elevator feeling in your stomach that she'll never know. You get that feeling that you'll be forced to write a cheesy Collegian column about her that makes ""Sleepless in Seattle"" look like ""Girls Gone Wild.""

You go to sleep. You wake up. She doesn't know. You're not in love. You're not obsessed. You blame it on the fact that you just need to get some, but still, it's about more than that. It would just be nice if once in your life, things worked out the way you wanted them to.

So ___________, it's about time you know*.

Now cut this out, fill in her name, and give it to her, coward. Just let me know how it works out.

Matt Brochu is a Collegian columnist."

But tonights basically the last night i have to go out and have fun with beth.  for about two months.  i need towake the fuck up but i just cant.

i cannot wait for the moment when i can actually just rest.  i think next tuesday, the 14, im going to take my exam from 11:30 until 2:30 and then come back to my house and sleep until i wake up, then leave to come home.  that sounds like an excellent plan for me.  almost done with one paper, one more to go.  im getting not only physically exhausted but mentally exhausted as well.  i just want to be left alone, i can't handle people anymore.

by the way, i have the worst fucking head cold in the world.  i cannot stop sneezing and its pissing me off to no end.  and its so uncomfortable."

Here is your horoscope for Friday, November 19:

Someone you've been admiring from afar -- either for professional or personal reasons -- is about to let you know that the feelings are mutual. It may be subtle, though, so listen carefully.

That was my horoscope for friday night.  I remember reading it friday afternoon and thinking, haha...suuure.  this is one of those weird horoscopes that (not that i live my life by them, but sometimes they are semi-true or can relate to the situation....) just dont make sense....but yeah....it kind of completely came true....except for the subtle part.  that part wasn't quite true.

it wasnt subtle...
maybe we were both admiring each other from afar...
i think thats true...
but it really wasn't subtle...it was the opposite of subtle."

"event","And once again, here I am sitting on top of the giant pile of shit I created for myself.  I wasn't thinking straight, I didn't realize that my head had one idea and my actions had another.  I didn't realize what I was getting myself into.  And I don't regret doing anything, it was nice while it lasted.  I don't expect anything.  I just wish that no one knew.  I realize that in some situations, it would be my fault that everyone knows.  But I didn't tell some people, they know because they were there.  The way Hunter looked at me this morning kind of chilled my blood.  When he approached me tonight at the party, I just freaked out.  I don't know what to do.  I don't want to sit here and be afraid to do anything.  I need to live my life for myself, I deserve to be somewhat selfish sometimes.  Don't I?  Isn't that what everyone else does?  Don't they have happy lives?  I was always under the impression that you need to do what makes you happy.  And what I did made me happy, but it wasn't supposed to have happened.  I could have stopped it, he could have stopped it, but we both didn't.  It's both of our faults.  Right?  Should I have not gone over there?  Should I have just gone home by myself, stayed there, slept in my car.  I don't know.  I felt that I had no options last night that made sense.  Nothing about last night made sense.  And I'm going to be making up for that for a while.  Yay.  My life sucks...and I have to resist being afraid and resist talking to him...right?"

"event","I am so hungry.  No money and no food sucks.  

Life is getting to be way to weird.  Around every corner is the impossible lurking.  Its like, everything I never expected to happen is happening.  And its really weird for me.

The weirdest part is that it seems like he is opening his heart up to me again.  What's even weirder is that I dont know if I can handle it yet.  Or ever.

P.S.  My house is infested with mice.  I hate winter."

"event","""Nothing Better""

Will someone please call a surgeon
Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart
That your're deserting for better company?
I can't accept that it's over... 
I will block the door like a goalie tending the net
In the third quarter of a tied-game rivalry

So just say how to make it right
And i swear i'll do my best to comply

Tell me am i right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together

I feel must interject here you're getting carried away feeling sorry for yourself
With these revisions and gaps in history
So let me help you remember.
I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear.
I've prepared a lecture on why i have to leave

So please back away and let me go
I can't my darling i love you so...

Tell me am i right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together
Don't you feed me lines about some idealistic future
Your heart won't heal right if you keep tearing out the sutures

I admit that i have made mistakes and i swear
I'll never wrong you again
You've got a lure i can't deny, 
But you've had your chance so say goodbye
Say goodbye

""Clark Gable""

I was waiting for a cross-town train in the london underground
When it struck me that I've been waiting since birth to find
A love that would look and sound like a movie so I changed
My plans and rented a camera and a van and then I called you
""I need you to pretend that we are in love again"" and you agreed to

I want so badly to believe that ""there is truth, that love is real""
And I want life in every word to the extent that it's absurd
I greased the lens and framed the shot using a friend as my stand-in
The script it called for rain but it was clear that day so we faked it
The marker snapped and I yelled ""quiet on the set""
And then called ""action!""
And I kissed you in a style that clark gable would have admired
(I thought it classic)

I want so badly to believe that ""there is truth, that love is real""
And I want life in every word to the extent that it's absurd
I know you're wise beyond your years, but do you ever get the fear
That your perfect verse is just a lie you tell yourself to help you get by?"

I am so fearful of marriage.  And I know, that at being on the brink of turning 21, that this is absurd...but I must speak of this.  I am terrified of investing my life, my soul, my love, into one person.  ""The Man"" of my life.  Only to never know if he is going to cheat on me, divorce me, use me.  Or if I will cheat on him, divorce him, use him.  I cannot count on that reliability.  Not right now.  Fearful of never.  And there is time.  There will ""always be time"" But what about now?  What am I to do now?  I am extremely distrustful of people, especially men.  I feel like I cannot afford to engage in anything worthy of being called a relationship because I am simply afraid of being hurt.  Of being vulnerable.  I don't know who is going to turn on me next.  I dont know which friend I trust and love is going to use me somehow and leave me.  I have my trusted few.  The ones that engulf my life.  The ones I love more than anything.  The ones I would do anything for.  These few people make my life so much more fufilling.  Each day I never know whats going to happen.  I do, but I dont.  I am still so thankful for them.  And fearful with what time will bring.  But one day, I need to grow up and do something.  And i know that they ALL wont be there with me, but I hope a few of them will stick by.  Please guys?

I haven't been in a ""real"" relationship in over four years or just about that.  I don't know how to trust someone with my heart.  I don't know how to let myself just fall for someone.  I feel like I pass up so many opportunities because I am fearful.  Not that there are many around...
But what if I am somehow stopping all of this by some means?  I'm sure that there aren't people lined up at the door just to spend time with me.  I'm glad there aren't, but soemtimes, it'd be nice if there were...I don't know what I'm doing right now, which is ok, I'm young, I have time.  I just wish taht something would be clear to me.  Something would just happen to tell me that this is where I am supposed to be, this is whats supposed to be happening.  

Basically, I'm lost.  Anyone want to be my guide?"

"event","So I've come to some sort of realization.

Maybe a few.
Well, one is that I need to stop living in my little fantasy world.  Now, this may sound slightly creepy.  And I'm not saying that I have scizophrenia.  That would be far from what I mean.  I overanalyze every little aspect of life.  Cut it up into a million pieces and then study each and every one.  Then, while you study them all, you imagine elaborate stories, each one having the slightest tangents to change everything.  Then you spend so much time inside your head, that you forget about what's REALLY going on.  Then you forget the point of it all.  The moral of the story, possibly.  Or even one of those small lessons you learn on the journey.  And sometimes this escalades so far into reality that you soon forget things like who kissed who, who threw the first punch, who really lead who on.  You forget the most important details because you were too busy studying the minor ones.  How he held you tighter, how he whispered to you that you were so beautiful, or even how he held your gaze longer than night.  Your mind begins to flutter off to never-never land as you forget the most obvious things.  Youre the one to walk up to him, you're the one to smile a little more.  As your mind wanders off into fantasy land, you are sending off these signals, and possibly even imagining a few received ones as well.

The point is, I still haven't cried.  I'm not sure if I will.  I think that, as of now, my standpoint on this issue is that I don't really care.  I'm sure this is subject to change.  In fact, tomorrow when I wake up, I probably wont feel the same way.  But whatever.   I need to go to bed.  Stat."

"event","It is 4 am.  I went to bed at 1 am.  I cannot sleep for over four hours per night, and thats just if I am lucky.  

""A smart girl kisses but doesn't love, listens but doesn't believe, and leaves before she's left.""

I found that in my friend's profile.  Its always kind of bothered me, but tonight, since I haven't been sleeping, it REALLY bothers me.  How sad is it that girls (or anyone) has to tell themselves anything resembling this?  And before anyone thinks anything resembling ""Who the hell cares"", its 4 am and I do.

It is just so upsetting that in the year 2004, young women can fight for their country, they don't have to have children, they are seen for more than just sex appeal but to trust in love is unheard of.  The newspaper just had an article in it about how relationships here are unheard of, and the only way that they might actually happen is through ""hooking up"" repeated times until HE decides to make it any type of official.  Basically, all guys here are scumbags who want to fuck.  If you are a good enough fuck, and asked to be fucked again, then you will be able to keep a guy.  Voila, you have a boyfriend.  Don't respect your own personal views girls, because here, the only way to have a relationship is to be a whore.  

And to think, this article was a sort of survival checklist for freshman.  God save you all.

I guess I've just lost my entire appeal to the whole love sha-bang.  I've been out of the game for too long?  I don't know how to share my feelings.  I don't know how to show how I feel.  When it comes to any type of extreme emotional moment, I don't know what to do.  I'm not sure if I ever did, but as of now, with the darkness of the big 2-1 lurking in the corner, I feel like I should know now.  

Since the entire Greg ordeal, I haven't cried.  Not once.  I haven't dealt with the fact that I have NO clue what's going.  All I know is that we aren't friends and there are really weird vibes.  That's it.  I don't know if I should talk to him.  Or if I should just never talk to him again.  Is it a fixable situation?  Are these ever?  So Beth and I decided that I need to cry and I need to deal with it.  I wish it was easier said than done.  I honestly haven't thought once that he was an ""asshole"", the typical girl response to anytime a guy is being sketchy.  I haven't thought ill of him to any extreme at all.  And this is extremely strange.  Usually I am able to hate him on some level.  I really wish that I could hate him.  But I think that right now, he still doesn't exsist.  Since the summer has just ended, it still doesn't quite feel like fall is coming.  I need to be forced to encounter him more.  Nudge the wheel at the top of the hill a little, so that it can roll, SO THAT SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN.  I would be happy with him telling me that he never wants to talk to me again.  I would be happy if I knew anything.  Then at least I can chill the fuck out.  

The few hours of sleep that I do get are spent with the strangest dreams.  Full of things that happened, some that didn't, and the weirdest plots.  

I think that everyone on campus is asleep or just not at their computer.  At least the ones on my buddy list.  I feel like sleep might not happen for a while."

"event","Contrary to its rather negative reputation in the West, the Pig of Chinese Astrology may be the most generous and honorable Sign of the Zodiac. Pigs are nice to a fault and possess impeccable manners and taste. They have so much of the perfectionist in them that others may be inclined to perceive them as snobs, but this is a misconception. Pigs are simply possessed of a truly luxurious nature, one that delights in finery and riches (in surroundings, food, lovemaking and otherwise). This Sign believes in the best qualities of mankind and certainly doesn't consider itself to be superior. Pigs also care a great deal about friends and family and work hard to keep everyone in their life happy. Helping others is a true pleasure for the Pig, who feels best when everyone else is smiling.

A Pig with no one around to appreciate its giving nature is a sad sight. Pigs are so magnanimous they can appear almost saintly; this can lead some less-than-well-intentioned souls to stomp all over this Sign, and the bad news is, the Pig will take the blows! Pigs make great companions in part because of their refusal to see the more negative or base qualities in a partner, but that rose-colored view can lead to this Sign's allowing itself to be taken advantage of. Contrary to their seemingly benign dispositions, however, Pigs can be quite venomous in response to being crossed by a lover, friend or business partner.

Pigs are highly intelligent creatures, forever studying, playing and probing in their quest for greater knowledge. They can be misinterpreted as being lazy, however, due to their love of reveling in the good stuff; this Sign could happily spend hours on end making love, napping, taking a long bubble bath or dallying over an incredible spread of rich foods. Pigs tend to make wonderful life partners due to their hearts of gold and their love of family. Even so, Pigs can be rather exclusive, choosing to spend time with those who will appreciate them most and ignore the rest of the populace. Pigs would do well to realize that there's more to life than being needed. When they open up their world to a diverse group of people, they will truly bloom."

Nor did I say that anyone was a ""horrible friend"" because there wasn't enough room in the car or that you guys did that without me.  I do not look to my friends to cater to my every need and make me happy.  I do, however, look to my friends to be considerate of other people's feelings, including my own, which is what I try to do for everyone else.  And since I do not like ""livejournal fights"" and I use this because sometimes I'm too lazy to write what I feel or think down on paper, I am just going to have to make most or all of my future entries private.  I did not say that anyone was a bad friend, or that I didn't like anyone.  Just because I chose to say that Dan was a good friend to me, doesn't mean that all of my other friends are bad.  The reason I am going to make it private, not that I need a reason, is because everything I say is taken the wrong way.  I would much rather not let anyone read this then have them get upset with me for feeling the way that I do.  If any of you have something to say to me, please do not comment on here.  You all know my phone number, where I live, you can call me and talk to me about it.  That way, maybe there won't be anymore ""8th grade drama"" following me around."

Cognitive homework.  Three of the most confusing questions in the entire world and since I'm stupid, I don't get them.  Due Tuesday morning at 8 am.  Tomorrow night I'm sitting for Beth's drawing class again.  This time in a reclined position.  I get paid $15...so its all good.

Ever since last weekend everything has been so messed up.  It doesn't feel like this past week was real for me.  Last friday I spent the entire night awake with mike, then saturday night I hung out with Greg all night, sunday I studied hardcore from 10 pm until 3 am.  And then some more in the morning, 15 minutes before I leave to take my test, I throw up in the bathroom and just get so sick all day long.  Come back, lay around for a while, just do shit.  Tuesday I went to class, did nothing.  Wednesday went to class, went to the bar, it was weird, i stayed up all night again with mike, went to my 8am on thursday morning, came back, tried to work on this homework for cognitive.  i couldnt even read words.  then I went to bed at 9:30.  woke up at 1:20 on friday.  Missed my 10:40, where we got our tests back.  everyone did so badly that he had to add 4 points to everyones grade.  I'm screwed.  Then the weekend began.  We went to Jordan Lake on friday afternoon, me beth jake and logan.  spent time there, made hamburgers and hot dogs, drank some beers, just enjoyed the weather.  then we came back, drank, went out, i totally ran into hunter.  hung out with him, weirdest situation ever.  i dont know how i feel about it.  i dont like thinking about him, i dont like dreaming about him, i hate seeing him but i hate it when i dont see him.  i just want to get to know him better, i just wish that there was so way to see into the future, to let myself know to stop thinking about him or to continue.  if its going to work one day or if it isnt.  i just cant handle not knowing.  i hate it.  it drives me insane.  and its not fair.  because i never know.  and when i think that i do know, im usually wrong.  i just HATE being a girl and i HATE having emotions.  I just want to be emotionally shut off from everything and everyone.  just exist.  you know?

I remember one time like senior/junior year of high school, i said something to jeremy along the lines of this ""I wish that people came with tags on their shirts that said if they were a good match for you.  Similiar to that pick up line, where you look at someones shirt, they ask you what you are doing, you say 'checking to see if you were really made in heaven' or something lame to that effect.  And you would read this tag and just know everything you need to know about the person.  See the future.  Know if they can take a joke, if they are sensitive to some things.  Everything.  And if you didn't like what you read, you smile and keep walking.""

I don't even know what to think or to feel.  I am so afraid right now that Logan is going to come back, come into my room and say that he has to pack his things up today and leave....

I don't know what I am going to do next year.  I am so afraid.  I know that its all going to be ok, that I will have so much fun, everyone will be happy.  I am going to live in my own fucking house...I am going to be a resident of Gibsonville North Carolina.  Weird. Weird. Weird.  But what's going to be weirder is not having Mike, Jake, or Logan around all the time.  I won't be able to see Jaime or Linds much either.  They will no longer be right next door.  I am already stressing out over moving out of my room at home, I do not know where I am going to put any of my stuff.  My room down here is smaller than my bedroom at home, and my bedroom at home is filled with stuff.  Stuff that I can't get rid of.  It took me almost 21 years to collect. 

I just don't know so many things right now.  I hate not being able to plan ahead, not knowing what's going to happen.  I hate it so much that sometimes I get lost inside my own head because I am freaking out so badly.  I just want to be carefree for at least a week straight.  Nothing to worry about, nothing to be afraid about.  Everything will be fine, perfect, for one straight week.  I need that so badly.  I just need some sense of comfort right now.  Something concrete that isn't going to disappear, something that is around all the time.  That won't leave me.  

I really have been hating myself lately for liking all of these boys.  Right now, no boy in his right mind would want to settle down.  Especially not here.  And I keep thinking that maybe, just maybe, something might work out to more than just a one night thing.  It hasn't, and I doubt that it will ever.  And I am so sick of trying.  And by trying I do not mean trying in a weird way.  I am sick of smiling, talking, flirting, just seeing boys.  They just sicken me.  People have begun to sicken me.  I feel like no one cares anymore about other people's feelings.  Everyone is in this game for themselves.  And its so sad.  So sad.  Its so sad to live in a world where, right now, the comfort and security that I would love to have will not come to me for a very long time.  And I hate the fact that I get so excited about some boys.  I hate how I act weird around them.  This has never happened before.  Usually I can at least act semi like me.  I hate how all I can think about is ""him"" and all I ever dream about is ""him"".  Thank God I didn't sleep last night.  I am afraid of what I would have had to suffer through while I was sleeping.  

Why is it so unacceptable for me not to be a huge slut?"

she was quite into ceramics most of her life.  i remember her making garden gnomes when i was a wee one.
they took over her lake-front property and often my dreams.
creepy little fucks they were.

my father put it aside for me.  i&#8217;ve not seen it yet, but my understanding is that it is huge.  
dad compared it to a 55-gallon drum.  hot damn.  

i&#8217;m correct in assuming i can use such a machine for pottery firing, no?

<b>The Legionnaire&#8217;s Lament</b>
<i>The Decemberists</i>

I&#8217;m a legionnaire
Camel in disrepair
hoping for a frigid air to come passing by
I am on reprieve
lacking my joie de vivre
missing my gay paris
in this desert dry

And I wrote my girl
told her I would not return
terribly taken a turn
for the worst now I fear

Its been a year or more
since they shipped me to this foreign shore
fighting in a foreign war
so far away from my home

If only summer rain would fall
on the houses and the boulevards
and the side walk bagatelles it&#8217;s like a dream
with the roar of cars
and the lulling of the cafe bars,
the sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine.
Lord I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll ever be back again.

la la la la dam
la la la low

Medicating in the sun
pinched doses of laudanum
longing for the old fecundity of my homeland
Curses to this mirage!
A bottle of ancient Chiraz
a smattering of distant applause
is ringing in my poor ears

On the old left bank
my baby in a charabanc
riding up the width and length
of the Champs Elysees

If only summer rain would fall
on the houses and the boulevard
and the side walk bagatelles it&#8217;s like a dream
with the roar of cars
and the lulling of the cafe bars
the sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine
Lord I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll ever be back again

"event","<b>Giving The Freedom To Live</b>
<i>Accepting The Journeys Of Others</i>

Each of us, in life, walks on the special path that the soul is destined to undertake. Our journeys are very different and we progress at different rates. The pitfalls and blessings we encounter are unique, yet we are all learning and no one form of knowledge is more important than any other. Even so, when we observe others, it can be easy to pass judgment on their decisions and to assume their actions will correspond with what we feel is right. But for every problem, there are a multitude of solutions. Everyone makes mistakes and, while watching others do so can be frustrating, it is important that you accept each person&#8217;s unique way of doing things. Giving others the freedom to act in the way they feel are best without the fear of harsh judgments honors the capacity for growth that all people possess.

It is helpful to practice accepting others as they are. Never judge the decisions of others based on the path you would have taken because every person lives by different values and experiences. Challenge is a universal concept, but we all deal with difficulties in our own way. Give others the space to fail, but don&#8217;t harden your heart against their experience. It isn&#8217;t wise to try and fix people or control situations. You may feel compelled to intervene when difficulties arise, but it is important only to offer guidance when asked unless the person is involved in a truly dangerous situation or cannot act for themselves. Failure to choose the right path or to make enlightened decisions is simply another step on the journey. It is a means to experience and wisdom. Letting go of the need to influence others does not discount offering loving support and it does not mean that you need to stop caring. It does mean stepping back, dissolving judgment, and gracefully allowing others! to live their own destinies.

Giving others the freedom to blossom in their own journeys gives you the freedom to take more notice of your own. You may not condone the actions you see taking place, but your reactions will be more loving by letting them be. And you will be able to focus on just being yourself, confident that the path you take is as right, valid, and special as any other.

The absence of God will bring you comfort, baby
And planning&#8217;s for the poor so let&#8217;s pretend that we&#8217;re rich
And I&#8217;m not my body or how I choose to destroy it
Folk singers sing songs for the working, baby

We&#8217;re just recreation for all those doctors and lawyers
There&#8217;s no relief for the bleeding heart
&#8216;Cause they&#8217;ll be losing bodies tonight

And Rob says you love, love, love and then you die
I&#8217;ve watched him while sleeping and seen him crying with closed eyes
And you&#8217;re not happy but you&#8217;re funny and I&#8217;m tripping over my joy
But I just keep on getting up again

We could be daytime drunks if we wanted
We&#8217;d never get anything done that way baby
And we&#8217;d still be ruled by our dueling perspectives
And I&#8217;m not my perspective
Or the lies I&#8217;ll tell you every time

And Morgan says, maybe love won&#8217;t let you down
All of your failures are training grounds
And just as your back&#8217;s turned you&#8217;ll be surprised she says
As your solitude subsides

And Mike I&#8217;ll teach you how to swim
If you turn the bad in me into good again

And I say there&#8217;s trouble
When everything is fine
The need to destroy things
Creeps up on me every time
Just as love&#8217;s silhouette appears
I close my eyes and disappear tonight

And something&#8217;s got to change
&#8216;Cause our love&#8217;s the slowest moving train"

"event","i finally gave in and went to the hospital.  after 3 long needles full of locaine and some scalpel slices, my toe is tidily wrapped in gauze and non-ouchy medical tape.  i underwent this small surgical procedure while awake, which was terrifying because it was done right in front of my eyes.  i have a &#8216;thing&#8217; for scalpel slices... they make me want to puke.

i warned the friendly young doctor that i would in fact swear when she touched my sore infected toe.  she laughed out loud at this point.  (lolz!) it&#8217;s refreshing to have a cool and personable doc for a change.  my usual physician is a wee bit uptight.

i was prescribed vicodin but the pharmacy gave me hydrocodone instead.  i&#8217;m assuming this may be the generic version of vicodin?  my insurance tends to cause such substitutions.  either way, i have been stoned since i returned home.  i had a slice of peanut butter chocolate cream pie and some smart puffs for dinner.  now i have a stomach ache and my toe is hurting again.  i was forced to take two naps; my eyes owned me this evening.  now i sit here half asleep and sore in my bed at just after 1am.  

i miss joe and wish he was beside me.  it&#8217;s becoming increasingly difficult to be without him, namely in the evenings and at bedtime.  it&#8217;s not that i don&#8217;t miss him during the day time or whatever, but at least i am keeping busy with work.  i am after all a woman who enjoys her personal time etc, and don&#8217;t believe that spending 24/7 with your love is a smart idea.  but i do know that my favorite time of each and every day is my time spent falling asleep or waking up with joe.  the combination of two of my two favorite things in life:  sleeping and joe. <3

this reminds me, what's your take on couples moving in/living together?  when is too soon in  your opinion?  what are some general rules one should pay attention to?  i have lived with a boyfriend before, but we had an awful relationship to begin with, and i was in a different place in my life.  at this point, because i am a much healthier and conscience woman, and because i want to do things with with joe, i'm curious what others might offer in regards to advice or opinions on this matter.  

anyway, i should try to sleep some more.  i have a lot of catch up to play tomorrow due to the two days of babysitting daniel this week, as well as the time missed from the whole green toe ooze debacle.

a few notes to myself regarding things i would like to accomplish in july:
&#8226; finally make the skirts from the patterns i made this past spring
&#8226; also make some appliqued pillows
&#8226; trim down my inventory by listing large lots of vintage goodies
&#8226; photoshoots with live models: used book store, those two houses in ocean park, abandoned house in saco, farmers market, beach, laural hill, garden store 
&#8226; rollerskating!
&#8226; camping with joe
&#8226; create wall art gift for jeff's 31st bday
&#8226;&#160;bring daniel to children's museam & funtown

"event","my left toe is revolting, i&#8217;ll just say that.

last weekend i gave myself a pedicure.  i may have gone a little to far with the cuticle remover.  later that day, i stubbed the same toe on the corner of the staircase on my way up from the laundry room.  i must have said the words &#8216;cunty whoreface fucker fucky fuckface asshole&#8217; at least 15 times immediately following the stubbage.  yeah, i&#8217;m a classy broad at times like these.

almost a week later, i can hardly put weight on it.  when i do apply pressure,  a wee bit of green oozes from the crack beside the nail.  mmmmm green ooze.

tina suggests i go to the outpatient for treatment, as it is quite obvious that an infection is present.  i am putting it off as long as humanly possible because i feel like a bit wimp going into the ER because of a stubbed toe.  that and i was just there like 3 weeks ago because my cat attacked me, causing a painful infection in my right hand.  argh.

last night joe and i went to the movies.  we saw mr. & mrs. smith, which was funny but a bit drawn out/long.  maybe it wasn&#8217;t all that long, but it felt like it because my ass was numb and my foot felt like it had a heart of it&#8217;s own, throbbing and burning like hell.  

i&#8217;d planned to go to the doctor today but didn&#8217;t end up following through with that.  instead i did some work this morning, then took a darvacet in hopes of masking the pain. yes, it masked the pain for a spell, but it also knocked me out from about 3-5pm, cutting into my productivity time.  it&#8217;s 8 pm and here i sit, slowly but surely preparing items for tomorrows sales.  i was supposed to be through with work by 8pm, but i feel as if i should continue on for a bit considering the lengthly nap i took.  all i know is that i would like to throw this ibook out of the window and chill with joe instead.

should i just do microsurgery on my toe myself?  i <b>am</b> a trained veterinary professional by trade, having much exposure to declawing surgeries... it&#8217;s not like this is all that different?

<i>*disclaimer: i am <b>not</b> a supporter of the declawing of cats! this is one reason i no longer work in this field."

"event","it&#8217;s sunday morning and i am sitting around my (filthy) house in yoga pants and a tank top that is two sizes too big.  because i am so pre-menses that i could eat a golden retriever in it&#8217;s entirety, i had a large triangle of asiago focaccia for breakfast along with my requisite green tea. mmmm.

yesterday was a long but good day.  i woke up (beside joe) in a great mood and went out to some &#8216;estate sales.&#8217;  i tell you what... i hate hate <b>hate</b> it when assholes advertise their junky ass yard sales as estate sales.  estate sales and garage sales are entirely different things.  i really wish people would advertise correctly.  it&#8217;s a waste of my time stopping at four different sales only to find an array of dirty children&#8217;s clothing and stained tupperware&#8482;.  

<center><img src=""http://jm.g.free.fr/smileys/cute_smileys/bigwhack.gif""></center>

after that, i decided to give up on the yard sale thing.  it was super hot/humid and i was getting discouraged by the lack of vintage treasures.  i decided to switch things up a bit and found my way to kennebunkport.  windows down and sunroof open, i sped down the various narrow and winding roads which hug the shoreline and divide the finely groomed lawns from the sharp and tall dunegrass.  it was downright lovely.

instead of feeling envious of those who have what i desire (in regards to living situations and materialistic possessions), i smiled at the man walking his handsome, show-worthy <a href=""http://rebturtle.com/images/Mutts/Vizsla%20Puppies%20001.jpg"">Vizslas</a> (my new favorite breed of dog, btw).  i waved at the divine middle-aged woman with her bicycle&#8217;s basket full of wildflowers as she  jay-walked in front of me.  i let the overly-tan trust fund teenagers in the convertible vw rabbit have the right of way when the sign clearly suggested otherwise.  i try to embrace the good fortune of others instead of sneering or hating; karma is a strong force, and i know that i too will someday live in a charming beach house with a modest stretch of beach to (selfishly) call my own.  

after getting lost in cape porpoise, i made my way to ocean park, where i quickly found a parking spot and headed for the beach.  joe told me that tina had left me a message about going to the beach, so i figured i would try my luck and see if i could find her since she wasn&#8217;t answering her cell phone.  my first thought was to try the same locale that she and i had spend the morning at earlier in the week; a usually tranquil section of beach at the end of temple ave in my hometown of old orchard beach/ocean park.  strangely enough, i found her!  her car was parked two cars down from where i parked mine, which is quite odd considering the seven miles of beach available and the bustling beginning of tourist season in our cozy beach town.  

then it was a matter of finding her on the crowded, overrun beach.  the sand was so effing hot, i had to put my sandels back on and akwardly run so the skin on my feet wouldn&#8217;t bubble or burst into flames.
oddly enough, i found her with no trouble at all... down by the waters edge with her son and husband.  
we played in the water, played in the sand, and got some much needed vitamin d from the sun.  and cancer... don&#8217;t forget the cancer. mmm uvb rays.  joe met up with us and dove into the freezing cold water like a champ.  chris mentioned something about his own nuts being inside of his stomach at this point.  what a lovely mental image.

tina and family left soon after because d&#8217;s skin was showing a bit of pink.  joe and i remained for a bit, watching the nosey rubber-neckers stare blankly at the emergency vehicles and the poor lady who passed out from heat exhaustion,  then left (again walking like morons through the hot sand to get to my car) and had some ice cream at the cute little parlor on the corner.  we sat under a tree in the grass and my black raspberry melted over my hands.  

i came home to shower and get ready for the antique auction.  joe had plans with his little sister, so we went our seperate ways.  after showering, i immediately starting sweating again... got to love humidity. :(
i then decided to go to the auction a bit late.  instead of hurrying around, i remained in my towel and laid on my bed in front of my ghetto fan.  being all pre-menses (as i mentioned in the beginning of this gawd awful entry), i was feeling &#8216;frisky&#8217; and send joe a subtly naughty text message, and he showed up at my door in less than ten minutes <img src=""http://jm.g.free.fr/smileys/yahoo_batting.gif"">.

naughty, naughty.  and sweaty!  oh my.  :ahem:  
to quote him: &#8220;my work here is done.&#8221;  hahaha... <3

after cleaning up (sorry, that was TMI, wasn't it?), i took off to the auction.  this was the first time i'd been to this type of auction.  as i pulled in to what seemed like the <b>sketchiest</b> of locations, i had second thoughts.  the building was looked creepy and i didn&#8217;t see many cars.  as i drove around the back, i then noticed a bunch of bmw&#8217;s, volvos, and other pricey rides.  i then knew that i was in the right place.  

as i went inside, i felt a bit overwhelmed.  due to the fact that i was a bit late, the auction had begun and the place was quite lively.  some fat old white haired man noticed my befuddled look and asked me how i was doing.  i mentioned that i was new to this and he gave me a quick but helpful tutorial.  i got myself a number, sat down beside a nice elderly couple who were apparently spending hundreds of dollars on miniature metal pedal cars, and got my bid on.  

there was a nice man named jack who befriended me almost immediately.  he was a bit flirty but harmless, and was set the idea of helping me out.  we spoke for a bit and he asked what type of dealer i was.  when i told him i deal in vintage clothing and am now looking to broaden my scope of knowledge to other textiles such as linens (and household collectibles), he &#8220;took me under his wing,&#8221; so to speak. he pulled out the various textile lots that might otherwise be left without auctioning, and helped me get them for really low prices.  he was one of the men who showcased the antiques as the caller did the auctioning, and he would often take a small break, sitting beside me to give me tips and pointers.  and to flirt with me, argh.  

i&#8217;m not really sure how to tell men that i am not interested.  i am a very blunt person and sometimes fear that my straight-forwardness can come off as rude, so in situations such as these, i sometimes hold my tongue and try to let things work themselves out.  he wasn&#8217;t being obnoxious about it or coming on strong; he was a nice guy that probably just noticed that i was alone and didn&#8217;t have a ring on my finger.  he gave me his phone number for &#8216;business purposes&#8217; and said something like &#8216;if i was so bold, i would ask you for yours,&#8217;  i replied with some comment like &#8216;yes, that would in fact be rather bold of you!&#8217;  i thought he got the hint at this point.  i guess this only supports the fact that dropping hints is a retarded way of &#8216;communicating.&#8217;  a bit later, he took another break and asked me if i would be at the next auction, saying that he would like to bring me out for ice cream afterwards.  this is when i just smiled awkwardly.  at this point,  i should have told him that i&#8217;m not interested in anything beyond friendship, as i have a wonderful boyfriend whom i adore, but i wimped out, giggled awkwardly, and walked away.  argh.  i def have to make this clear to him next time i see him.  i have no problem being friends with him, in fact it would be nice to have friends who understand the excitement and challenges involved with dealing in antiques, etc..  it&#8217;s just weird now that he has shown other sorts of interest, i guess.  anyhow, my point is this:  i should just say what&#8217;s on my mind when it is on my mind.  i&#8217;m not some socially retarded fool, it&#8217;s not like i&#8217;m going to spurt out some obnoxiously rude banter.  i should have just casually said that i wasn&#8217;t looking for anything beyond friendship.  anyhow.

i came home with my newly acquired goodies (which i will post photos of as soon as i get to photographing them.  i still need to clean the linens, as many of them are soiled but not beyond repair).  it was sweltering hot upon my arrival home, so back into the cold shower i went.  soon after than, my sinus headache was fully ruling my head and face, so by 10:30pm i was ready for bed.  joe came over and joined me in my steamy bedroom.  we laid uncovered and unclothes in front of two fans, and he listened to me go on and on about my evenings events.  he told me about his night with his sister, etc, then we fell asleep.  my headache was even worse when i woke up.  luckily, the pain subsided due to the umm... natural remedy that joe gave me before he went to work.

yeah.  on that note, time to go shower and start my day.
i must do the following:
&#8226; buy air conditioner at sears
&#8226; clean my condo
&#8226; do a load of laundry
&#8226; pick d up, bring him to my parents pool for swimming and garden burgers, giving tina/chris some time to get stuff done
&#8226; maybe play mini-golf or something? who knows

"event","I&#8217;m quite clever at the art of time-wasting. Often I find myself sitting and considering what I should be doing as the minutes (and hours) pass, in lieu of assigning my work hours to much needed tasks and duties.

There are myriad hobbies and past times I would like to engage in, but my horrific time management skills emphasize the fact that there are never enough hours in the day. If only I could engineer a steadfast agenda to follow during the work week. Then my attitude might brighten and my energy may accumulate, allowing for increased social and recreational enrichment. Would be nice... very very nice.

It&#8217;s not often that I complete as much as I would like to on any given day. Some say that I may be setting too lofty a goal with each work day, causing me to feel overwhelmed and inevitably inviting disappointment. Of course, this is detrimental to my self-worth. It seems I may be getting worse and worse in this regard, finding myself increasingly distracted as days go by. I tend to start with brilliant ambition but sure as shit end up veering off into the direction of gaieties: sun bathing, weak attempts at organic gardening, massage therapy, merrymaking in general.

Although I do manage to make a decent living (despite my tendency to concede to the call of leisure), I feel less than happy with my ability (or lack thereof) to follow through with my endeavors. I should at least be putting in an earnest effort. It pains me to admit this, but I&#8217;ve begun to consider myself a bit of a slacker. Not so good, my friends, not so good."

Again, my day started out wonderfully due to the beautiful man I found pressed against me as my eyes slowly adjusted to the morning&#8217;s light. While lying there savoring him, I decided that waking up with Joe is in fact my absolute favorite thing in life. If that makes me &#8216;simple,&#8217; so be it.

He is most beautiful and sexy to me on these mornings. I feel so close to him and content as he holds me. I&#8217;ve never been held like this before. I&#8217;ve never felt so loved and in love. It&#8217;s fantastic!

Okay, enough of that. We all know that I can go on and on about Joe and my love for him, but I&#8217;ll spare you (for now).

Today is Monday and I have a busy week ahead of me. Because the weather promises to be warm and summery, I am going to work my tail off today and tomorrow so I can take some time to enjoy the beach later in the week. I&#8217;ll be spending the morning babysitting D again on Thursday, probably bringing him to the park and maybe for a walk around the promenade in Portland. I believe Joe has Friday off (if I understand correctly), I&#8217;m hoping he&#8217;ll have some time to go to the beach with me. I&#8217;m also hoping to spend some time with Tina this week, maybe get some lunch and go to Kittery to return a few things to J. Crew.

To Do:
&#8226; Update sales (pottery & collectibles)
&#8226; Photograph for tomorrow&#8217;s listings
&#8226; Put together lingerie lot
&#8226; Yoga
&#8226; Set up dentist appointment
&#8226; Call Tina
&#8226; Watch Rilo Kiley on The Late, Late Show tonight"

"event","hi hi
so i said i wasn't going to post entries here anymore, but here i am.

things are going well.  i had some allergy testing done on friday.
fourty-five or so holes in my right arm and twelve+ in my left.
though the results were inconclusive, i am feeling better.
the doc gave me some zertyc, which happens to be the only allergy medication that actually helps with the sinus pain and dizziness.

i'm a little behind with work but plan on playing catch up this coming week.  tomorrow will be a day full of photography and measuring dresses.  i sort of hope it rains because i am oh so tempted to go outside and play when the sun is shining.  just my luck, it will be a beautiful day to go to the beach and i will be stuck here playing dress-up with my life-size barbie.  oh well.  someone has to bring home the bacon, no?

joe is fantastic.  i really dig this guy.  i love spending time with him.  he really makes me smile.  he can always cheer me up, no matter how shitty my mood might be.  and he's a lot of fun.  i'm constantly smiling or laughing when with him.  it's nice to be this happy and in love. :)

today is father's day and i will not see my father.  he is up in unity maine with his other family, doing some picnic thing or whatever.  it's alright though. i spent some time with him yesterday, and will be bringing him to dinner one evening this week.  

i've managed to get a lot done tonight, though there are a few more things i need/would like to do.  i've cleaned my house, rearranged a closet, did a few loads of laundry, took some pics for work tomorrow, and gave myself a manicure/pedicure.  i'd like to find the motivation to get off of my ass and convert my closet from a storage area into an actual functional wardrobe closet; i'm sick of living out of laundry baskets and some random portable garment rack.  it's been this way since my father started the flooring/stairway project in early april and it's driving me bonkers.

in other news, i'm feeling good today.  the past few days have been sort of shitty, as i have had headaches, sinus pain, and neausea due to the allergy testing and the steroids i was given to open my airways a bit.  my body doesn't react well to things like that, leaving me pretty much useless and in pain.  but as i said, i am feeling well today, and keeping my fingers crossed that i continue to feel this good for the remainder of the day.  hell, i really need to feel great this week so i can get ahead with work.  

i've officially met the weight loss goal i had set in january.  i'm pleased to have lost 45 lbs since may 2004, 30 of which i lost in the past 4 months or so.  i know i've posted about this before, as well as the concern that some of my friends/family have had about the speed of the loss, but all is good... i am healthy and happy at a size 4 again.  i feel much more like myself, not some chubby, uncomfortable lady.

anyhow, i should make the effort and go work on my closet project again.  it's so nice out, i feel like i should be outside doing something, but a girl must have priorities.

more later.

for one, i need to stop posting my feelings regarding my relationship with my boyfriend in this journal.  instead, i need to tell him these things face to face.  

in the past few weeks i have become too comfortable with typing out these thoughts and feelings and have stopped telling him these important things in person.
i realized this today when thinking about yesterdays creepy and needy mood.  i simply should have sat down and brought it up to him.  he&#8217;s a loving and understanding man, i don&#8217;t know why i felt goofy bringing up the fact that i felt something was off.

here i go again... writing it here instead of talking about it.

"event","I'm not fond of these feelings, let's just start with that...

From time to time, I find myself feeling uneasy for reasons I can't seem to explain.
Like today, for example. I have a sad, sinking, and tight feeling in my stomach/chest.  

I'm able to push the feeling away for short spurts of time, doing other things to occupy my mind:
submerging myself in my work, calling a friend and talking about the most random things possible, working out for a bit, or reading a good book.  Unfortunately the tight spot in my chest comes back as soon as sit back and relax.  Hell, it can even infiltrate when I'm keeping busy.

What is this all about?  Am I crazy?  Is it because I am ovulating? God, I'd hate to think that my hormones can cause such upset inside of me.  I feel unreasonable and paranoid, even.  I can't help but wonder if I am just being blind to something, and my intuition is trying to tell me something.

In short, this is a bad thing.  If I only knew how to rid myself of this feeling.  I feel this is one of my greatest flaws.  It's as if my 'normal' thought process is out the window when this happens.  Luckily it usually doesn't last very long, a few days tops.  But while it <b>is</b> present, I have to do all I can to remain positive and sane.  

Argh. Sad sad sad.

I'm probably giving myself a fucking ulcer."

As I sit here in my ill-fitting 1970&#8217;s bikini, my partially bare asscheeks stick to this chair. My hair still wet from showering, I look less than presentable. It&#8217;s good thing (for the general public) that I&#8217;m working from home most of the day.

Today&#8217;s To-Do List: (to be updated as tasks are completed)
&#8226; Photograph & prepare 10 sundresses for this weeks sale
&#8226; Make phone calls:
- Tina about belly dancing class
- Barb for appointment (therapist)
- OB/GYN for appt to have my cervix inspected again
- Hanna & the other Tina (models), re: set up outdoor shoot (I&#8217;m still searching for ideas in regards to location of this shoot. I&#8217;ll post more about this later.)
- American Apparel about my previous order. I&#8217;m pretty sure I am going to cancel it (if it hasn&#8217;t already shipped) because a number of people are wanting to add to the order.
&#8226; Pack & ship last weeks sales (Shit! about 5 days late, I was waiting for printer ink! I need to remember to enclose a discount coupon and note of apology with each item in hopes of smoothing feathers a bit.)
&#8226; Home Depot, pick up:
- recycle bins
- trash can
- (2) 8&#8221; bull-nosed moldings for bathroom project
- large planter
- organic plant food (Unlikely to find such a thing at HD, anyone have any suggestions as to where one can buy organic gardening supplies? I&#8217;ve yet to look into this. *cough*Bin&#233;t?*cough*)
&#8226; Go to beach/lay in the sun (if time & weather permit)
&#8226; Yoga (Either find a 7pm class or practice from home for at least 1 hour. My body hated me last night; I did a rather advanced video after not practicing for about a week. Argh)
&#8226; Spend at least 2 hours working on trophygirlvintage @ eBay, trophygirlvintage dot com, and possibly on the selling journal.
&#8226; Hopefully see Joe in the evening <3"

"event","What a great feeling... kicking back in your newly cleaned home on a warm, mellow Sunday afternoon. I spent the entire day scrubbing, sorting, and getting rid of clutter. I am now physically drained yet happy as I lay against freshly laundered pillowcases, using my propped knees as a table and tapping away on this keyboard.

I&#8217;ve felt content today; I&#8217;m smiling from the inside out. The usual irritability that accompanies Sunday&#8217;s tasks didn&#8217;t make an appearance. Instead, I&#8217;ve felt appreciative, lucky, and at peace as I went about my duties.

I&#8217;m happy.

It&#8217;s a new thing for me really... sometimes my eyes well up with (happy) tears for what I would normally call &#8220;no good reason.&#8221; I&#8217;m certain that all of the pain and confusion of my past was worth it. Now I am able to take in and appreciate what it feels like to love and be loved.

I feel alive, in a way that I&#8217;ve only daydreamed about.

For as far back as I can remember, I&#8217;ve believed that I was just one of those (unlucky) people who would never experience real reciprocated love. Though I had been in a few long term &#8220;relationships,&#8221; I&#8217;d always felt as if I was alone in a number of ways.

Despite the fact that I was never fully happy with my most recent and longest relationship, I somehow managed to brainwash myself into believing that he was the best I could get. Meanwhile, my self-worth was at a less than healthy level and as time went by, I realized that I was losing all ability to feel excited and/or passionate about anything.

It wasn&#8217;t until a month or two after the break-up that I realized that the seemingly awful experience was actually going to benefit me greatly in the long run. I knew that the pain of the betrayal would lessen with the miracle of time, but I didn&#8217;t realize how much I would mature from it all.

I never allowed myself to fully trust boyfriends of my past, and was never able to be 100% myself. It&#8217;s not as if I was being fake with them, it&#8217;s just that I wasn&#8217;t as open and able to be vulnerable as I am with Joe. Although I am still slightly reserved, I see the reservations slipping away more each day. I trust Joe more than I&#8217;ve ever trusted another human being. For the first time, I can feel that I am loved. I can feel that I am cared for, and it feels really amazing instead of scary and intimidating.

It blows my mind how much I&#8217;ve changed (or actually blossomed) since December of 2003. If it wasn&#8217;t for all of the shit I went through in the past seven years, I&#8217;m not sure I would be able to fully appreciate the incredible connection that Joe and I have. Not until the past 6-12 months was I able to feel any sort of excitement or hopefulness, and not until I (re)met Joe was I able to feel the spectrum of emotions I&#8217;ve felt for the past two months. I feel more alive and in love every day. Joe has definitely sparked something inside of me."

"event","I love me some green tea. It&#8217;s a delightful staple in my diet. I like it over-steeped to the point of bitterness, giving my cheeks and palette that mysterious wet/dry sensation. Steaming hot to room temperature to ice cold, green tea pleases me to no end.

The benefits of this addictions are myriad, but I fear there&#8217;s one negative aspect of my high rate of consumption. You see, I never allowed myself to become a drinker of coffee due to a fear of sporting brown teeth. I&#8217;d heard that tea could also have a discoloring affect on the ol&#8217; dentadura, but refused to believe it. Unfortunately it seems I&#8217;ve been naive, as my teeth appear to have a yellow-green tinge these days. I hadn&#8217;t noticed this until seeing a photograph that Joe took of me at the beach last week.

<b>Nobody likes green teeth.</b>

I&#8217;m hoping there is something I can do to prevent this discoloration. If not, I hope to at least find a way to remove the green hue. Suggestions welcome.
(I&#8217;m assuming someone will recommend Crest White Strips. Yes, they definitely whiten the teeth, but unfortunately they make my teeth incredibly sensitive to the point that I can&#8217;t even expose them to air. This proves to be a challenge and huge inconvenience.)

This tinted teeth thing very well be a figment of my imagination, by the way.

Now I must turn the focus to sinus related issues and deliver myself to an appointment with an allergist for various tests and needles."

"event","at times like this i fully appreciate and revel in the fact that i took the risk of giving up my career as a veterinary assistant, giving in to my creative urges, and making an earnest attempt at starting/running my own business(es).  

as i lay on my patio, topless and listening to blonde redhead on the ipod, i sunbathe and study the pages of a current anthropologie catalogue, gathering inspiration from the exquisite color and composition of their set and photography.

ahh, the beauty of being your own boss and working from your home...  
however, in the winter months it&#8217;s not quite as rewarding. with so much time inside and being spending so much time at home, it&#8217;s easier to become burned out and discouraged.  the up side of the colder months is that sales are up and the profits are fantastic.  

once the warm weather comes, sales may slump some but i make sure to remember how lucky i am to be doing my own thing.  i&#8217;m really fond of the idea that i have no one to answer to and no timecard to stamp.  hell yeah.  and who can deny the pleasure of working in a bikini? (or in my case today, half of a bikini.)

back to the aforementioned anthropologie catalogue:
the composition of their photography is to die for. their color palette of their goods and sets coupled with the allure of their gorgeous models make the catalogue a work of art in my opinion.
though i look at their book as art more than advertisement, i must admit that i <i>do</i> give in and buy a flowing cotton lawn skirt or pair of earrings from time to time.  though i am not particularly font of prints (especially floral), i&#8217;m currently ogling a gorgeous <a href=""http://s7ondemand1.scene7.com/is-viewers/dynapi/src/lib/tsapi/images/cover.gif?220x340"">bedspread</a>, but am resisting because of my impulsive <a href=""http://www.tiffany.com/images/products/zoom_images/17837397_xl.jpg"">tiffany&#8217;s</a> purchase last month. (i allow myself a certain amount of disposable cash per month for the purchase of something frivolous but beautiful... as materialistic as it sounds, i adore visually pleasing objects, i guess?)

<i>random:
i must know, is there anything i can do to increase the view-ability of my ibook&#8217;s screen while in the full sun?  this is quite difficult, typing on a nearly invisible screen with hands greasy from body oil and laying on my stomach. dang.
</i>

anyhow, this is fantastic.  i&#8217;m getting some sun while working. i&#8217;d initially planned on going to the beach at some point today, but figured i should stay here and get some work done while sunbathing.  plus, topless sunbathing is prohibited in these parts. ;)

oh and last night was nice.  joe came with me to jeff&#8217;s mother&#8217;s house.  eric, his brother and my long-time friend, is back home from southern california for 10 days with his family.  his daughter lilly is just adorable, and quite tall at 2-years-old.  it was also nice to see angel (his step-daughter) and pj (his wife).
i hope to see them a lot more on this summer&#8217;s visit than i did last  year.  it was nice of joe to come with, and i&#8217;m really glad he had an okay time.  they are my extended family and it means a lot to me that he gets to know my loved ones. :)  he is so incredible and i was so happy to have him there with me.  he also accepted my invite to the levesque bbq this weekend, which pleases me to no end. :) 


we came back to my place for a bit after we visited the levesques.  there were so many stars in the sky last night and it would have been a perfect night to lay on the beach, but i still had a terrible stomachache and really needed to get some rest.  we laid down on my bed for a bit, being cooled by what may be the most ghetto oscillating fan in existence.  apparently we can&#8217;t keep our hands and mouths off of one another, because we ended up kissing (etc <img src=""http://jm.g.free.fr/smileys/cute_smileys/angel_not.gif"">)for a good hour.  i&#8217;ve never felt so much emotion as i do while i&#8217;m kissing him. i could kiss him and hold him all night long.  

yeah, i love joe more than i ever thought possible. and i seem to fall more in love with him every day. 
i love being with him, it doesn&#8217;t matter what we are doing.  i&#8217;ve never felt so loved and in love.  i&#8217;ve never felt so happy and lucky.  <3

"event","i have such a friggin&#8217; headache right now.  it really pissed me off that my allergy/sinus issues can turn into migraines.  i spent the last hour laying in the bathtub with a towel over my face.  my vision was blurry and my head was literally throbbing.  i took some leftover rx migraine meds i had (imitrex, i believe?) and that seemed to help some.  i&#8217;m still really foggy feeling, and my entire face hurts due to the inflamed sinus cavity.  awesome.


the weather was gorgeous today.  i managed to get some sun, walking around and going to estate sales with my mother.  she picked me up at 7:30am and we drove around portland and cape elizabeth with our trusty city map book, searching for the elusive estate sales of the wealthy cape suburbanites.  i didn&#8217;t bring home much in the way of vintage clothing, but i did pick up some neato fabric and linens, as well as some leather handbags.  i also was a fat kid and ate a cinnamon bun the size of my face.  mmm healthy breakfast.

after mom and i finished our ritual saturday morning bonding, she dropped me off at home.  i got my lazy on for a bit, assing around on the internerd for an hour or so.  after i drank some (too much) tea, then hopped in my car with rosa and headed to the antique market.  there i met a really gregarious rotund woman selling vintage jewelry.  we discussed the world of antique dealing and those known as &#8216;bottom feeders.&#8217;  she gave me some pointers on selling at these outdoor markets and i gave her some tips on selling online.  i fell in love with a jadeite multi-strand seed bead necklace she had, and she cut the price in half for me.  of course i was sans cash after spending it al on a collar & leash for miss rosa, so she kindly set it aside for me.  she took my business card and told me to come back next saturday with my collection of vintage jewelry so she could school me a bit.  nice lady, really.  it&#8217;s always refreshing to talk to someone else who works in and understands the whole antique/collectibles dealer thang.  

soon after our discussion&#8217;s end, i realized i was really dizzy and needed to head home.  the combination of the sinus infection, the lack of any substantial food, and the sun were getting to me fo shizzy.  i had planned on walking rosa on the beach at this point, but headed home instead.  

in hopes of ridding myself of this motherfucking headache, i figured i would get some more fresh air.  i donned the gardening gloves and wielded the garden tool thingie (i believe this is what one might call a HOE?) and proceeded to get my hands earthy.  cutting worms in half, smashing spiders, and turning the soil, i managed to till a one-foot wide strip along the eastern edge of the building.  i then did the ghetto thing and laid a pre-seeded pad of wildflowers along one end and poured an entire box of mixed wildflower seeds over the remaining area.  i can&#8217;t even imagine what is going to grow from this, if anything at all.  i&#8217;m so not a gardener, but i do enjoy getting dirty.  oh, and the headache remained.

i&#8217;ve been in a fog ever since, honestly.  the head throbs more and more as i sit here feeling shitty and pathetic because i would much rather be at some bbq or outside enjoying the summery night sky.  i can hear my neighbors hooting and hollering while listening to come generic country music.  even they are having a grand old time and they only have about 18 teeth between the 5 of them.  not that one needs teeth to have a good time, of course, but... nevermind, i don&#8217;t even know where i was going with that.

so hey it&#8217;s 8:42pm and i&#8217;m sitting at home alone with a heavy head, painful face, and wearing a too-tight tank top and not much else.  i did shave my legs and shower, and my hair looks cute.  it only figures that it would be cute on a night that i&#8217;m sitting home in my underpants listening to carly simon sing about apricot scarves."

"event","i did today&#8217;s work load yesterday so i could take today off.  
i woke at 6am to babysit daniel again today.  he was somewhat cranky and teary-eyed when tina left for work, but his mood changed quickly when we ran into the yard in our socks and played on the slide.
he squealed at seagulls and flashed me big toothy grins as out stockings became wet from the morning dew.

while eating a few animal crackers, we watched &#8216;the wiggles,&#8217; a children&#8217;s program on dvd that i find rather creepy and disturbing.  after that, we got dressed in play clothes and drove to a playground.  
swings, slides, and wood chips filled the morning.  daniel played with a little irish boy named colin while i awkwardly did the chit chat thing with boys father, who is a stay at home dad for two adorable blonde toddlers.  being only and &#8216;aunt&#8217; and not a parent, i found myself being overly cautious of daniel playing on the equipment, but this mister mom fellow assured me that i don&#8217;t have to spot the boy during every single activity. 

after that, the strangest thing happened.  i was driving by cheryl&#8217;s house and felt compelled to stop and see how she was doing.  she and i haven&#8217;t be so close lately, but for some reason i felt like i should stop and at least say hi.

i take daniel out of his car seat and knock on the door, which is slightly ajar.  i see that the television is on and that there&#8217;s a plate of food on the table, so i say &#8216;hello&#8217; and &#8216;cheryl?&#8217; a few times.  a few moments later, cheryl comes walking around the corner, hands over her eyes and walking off kilter.  she looks pale and really out of it.  she starts crying and says that she can&#8217;t see anything, and that she feels like she is going to pass out.  i put daniel down and put the chihuahua in the back room, as lola can be nasty and bitey sometimes.  i sit cheryl on the couch and she starts crying more.  she looks really out of it and her pupils are like the head of a pin.  i ask her if she&#8217;s had anything to eat, but she says she&#8217;s only had coffee.  she mentions her blood sugar, so i look in the refrigerator for something sugary.  i offer her applesauce or pudding, but she just ignores me.  she also ignore the water i offer.
 
i finally get her to lay down and she looks really uncomfortable.  she says she feels sick to her stomach and like she is going to pass out.  she mentioned that she had just called ed, her husband, and that he was on his way home.  i tell her that i&#8217;m going to stay with her until he gets there, but she says she thinks she needs to go to the hospital right away.  she&#8217;s wearing nothing but a tank top and some shorts, so she asks me to find her some underpants and yoga pants.  i get her dressed, just as ed shows up.  

at this point, ed and i agree that she may be having a panic attack, as she has had in the past.  whatever it is that is going on, she needs something.  there&#8217;s talk of calling an ambulance, so she could get some oxygen, etc, but cheryl isn&#8217;t into that idea anymore.  she says she is fine and wants him to call the doctor instead of going to the hospital.  ed ignores her pleas and puts her in the car to take her to the hospital.  
he thanks me for coming over to help her, but what he doesn&#8217;t realize is that i had no idea why i was stopping by when i did, all i knew is that i had to stop and see how she was doing.

i told ed to give me a call if he/they needed anything, and he said he would give me a call.  i haven&#8217;t heard from them since, i hope everything is okay. i&#8217;m actually going to call soon, as i am worried about her and the baby.  (oh yes, cheryl is 5 1/2 months pregnant, mind you).  

there are some other issues that i&#8217;m worried about, possible reasons for her not feeling so hot, but i won&#8217;t get into those issues here, as they are her business and i don&#8217;t want to post that stuff publicly on the internerd.  but i sure am concerned... i wish she would start taking better care of herself and her little one.  :/

other than that whole situation, today was really great.  daniel and i had lunch after the playground time.. chicken nuggets from david&#8217;s subshop. mmm.. processed chicken nugget things.  i actually had a BLT on rye, daniel had the nugs.  he didn&#8217;t really eat them though, but that&#8217;s my own fault... i gave him a cookie right before.  oops.

after tina came home from work, i went for a ride before heading home myself.  then i oiled myself up with neutrogena body oil, put on my amazingly slutty 1970&#8217;s red string bikini and laid on my lawn for 2 1/2 hours, reading &#8216;natural health&#8217; magazine and listening to the decemberists on the ipod.    rosa and i laid on some weird, scratchy brown polkadot blanket and soaked in the sun.  awww yeah.  where my freckles at, b?"

"event","my skin smells of joe&#8217;s cologne from hugging him before he left for work this morning.  i don&#8217;t really want to wash that away, but it&#8217;s 11:30am and i definitely could use a shower.

today is dreary again.  i suppose it will rain.  maybe someone should start building an ark.

my ears are happy right now, taking in a little azure ray as i work to list a bunch of shoes and random accessories on ebay.  i need to work on the website at some point today, but am lacking in the creativity department right now.  i&#8217;m also lacking in the html skills department.  i wish i could hire alli smith to create the site for me, but she seems busy lately.  perhaps i shall ask her again sometime soon.
of course there are many pre-made templates i could pay for, and some free, but i can&#8217;t seem to find anything that suits my taste or even resembles the look i am hoping to create.

the holiday weekend was pretty uneventful in regards to the usual memorial day social goings on.  since i no longer &#8216;party&#8217; as a verb, i stayed away from whatever rain-soaked events i was invited to.  i find that i still need to avoid many alcohol-related social gatherings due to the fact that i often feel tempted to jump from the wagon, despite the numerous benefits/positives i&#8217;ve gained from quitting the sauce.  i hope to be over that soon so that i can at least take part in a few of the get-togethers where drinking is the main activity.  then again, i&#8217;m not all that fond of being around a bunch of drunk people these days.  as the often singular sober one, i find myself feeling slightly embarrassed for the shit-faced folks.  i am reminded that i, too, acted like that when i had a few in me, and this gives me further incentive to keep up the alcohol-free lifestyle.  it&#8217;s interesting how different one can be when one has had a few too many.

though he has stated otherwise a number of times, i can&#8217;t help but wonder if i might be keeping joe from having a &#8216;good time&#8217; and living it up at parties and such.  of course i trust him when he says that he would rather spend this time doing whatever with me versus getting shitty and drinking his troubles away with a bunch of &#8216;party people,&#8217; but i just can&#8217;t help but worry a little that, for instance, his chillin&#8217; at home with me while his friends are out boozing it up will someday cause some sort of resentment towards me.  

i know, i know.. i&#8217;m over-thinking this and i should just shut the fuck up, right?  
also, it&#8217;s not fair to him that i doubt his word.  he&#8217;s a good, honest person and has no reason to lie to me.  he is an adult and will do what he wants to do.  boy i&#8217;m ridic sometimes, eh?
 
in short, i just don&#8217;t want anyone.. any friends or my boyfriend... to have to give up certain aspects of their respective lifestyles in order to spend time with me.  sometimes i feel like my decision to fill my time with anything <b>but</b> drinking/partying is an inconvenience to my friends.  

anycrap, i must return to work mode.

more later.

&#8226; sorting my entire wardrobe, which includes many large bags of tops, skirts, dresses, pants, undergarments, handbags, shoes, and various accessories
&#8226; trying on basically every single garment to see if it fits
<i>note (and by 'note' i mean huge tangent): <b>this</b> is the time daunting and somewhat depressing part. though i am thrilled and proud to have lost nearly 30 lbs since january, i find myself unable to fit into ANYTHING i own. i had purchased basically a whole new wardrobe in size 8 or 10 (from j. crew/anthropologie/gap/dkny) last year because i had lost like 15 lbs, and now none of it fits.  my favorite dresses, jeans, skirts, etc. are all at least 2-3 sizes too big now.  so i need to go through and try each piece on, setting aside things i really love and hoping they can be tailored to fit.  i'm not sure. but i think it's possible to have a size 8 dress taken in to fit a size 4? gosh, i hope so.    otherwise, it looks like i will be selling most of my wardrobe on ebay next week  i'm sort of scared to invest in <b>more</b> clothing, considering i have been losing an average of 7 lbs a month.  it's not like i want to be too much smaller, but at this point i am losing weight without really trying.  

anyhow, i have spent a good $400 on spring/summer clothing in my current size already, and don't have much to show for it.  grrr.  don't get me wrong, shopping is a guilty pleasure of mine, but it's annoying to me that even my underpants and bras are now too big.  my favorite dkny & seven jeans... they come off without even unbuttoning/unzipping.  i know i should not be complaining and certain friends are going to want to punch me in the face for bitching about such a thing, but it's costly and irritating to have to replace your entire fucking wardrobe.  even my SHOES are too big... huh? how does this happen?

(back to the description of my closet project)
&#8226; wash/press/hang each item that i do decide to keep
&#8226; bring to denise (my seamstress) those items which i assume are able to be tailored to fit me
&#8226; find a way to organize handbags and shoes that allows for ease in selection & use.
i think i will use <a href=""http://www.containerstore.com/browse/Product.jhtml?CATID=72586&PRODID=61479"">these</a> for shoes.  but handbags?  i don't know.  hooks on the inside of the closet door maybe?  bins or something?  

(omg i love organizing things... i am getting excited just thinking about it!  :screeee:)

&#8226; figure out how to utilize the three closets i have available for all of this (one in bedroom, two in spare bedroom)
&#8226; downsizing: talk myself into having a 'minimalist' wardrobe.  i have always had tons of clothing, most of which i don't or hardly ever wear.  i am sick of that.. it's a hassle and a waste.  i figure i have a pretty minimalist lifestyle otherwise, so i should do what i can to trim it all down to basics.  no more frivilous shit for me.  

i bought a ton of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00024JR7Q/qid=1117464349/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/104-5262752-9392733?v=glance&s=home-garden&n=507846""> these </a> in hopes of utilizing the space efficiently and resolving the problem of stuff slipping off of hangers all of the time.

hmmm, while typing that last sentance, i realized that i have put way too much fucking thought into all of this.  instead of sitting here typing about it, maybe i should get off my ass and get to working on this damn project?  my god, i'm terrible."

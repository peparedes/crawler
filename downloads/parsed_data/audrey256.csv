But I went to go see her and it was just like old times. we acted like dumbasses together and her mom got us mega bakered. man i swear that's all i did yesterday was smoke pot. it was great. anyhoo...

It is just so annoying that they can't understand that not everyone thinks the same way as them. today in cwi we were debating and we were talking about if we think that homosexuals should be more accepted. well why shouldn't they be. they're people just like everyone else. errr......

then fucking clint stevens pissed me right the fuck off!!!! i proved him wrong and the only thing he could come up with was ""oh, now that we all know you're a lesbian cassie we'll try to be more accepting of it."" i dont really care that he called me a lesbian that's not what i'm pissed off about, i could care less. it's just that i thought that at least he would be more accepting. errrr...I lost a lot of respect for him today. 

then when we had a debate about abortion today he was all like ""well if a 13 year old girl gets raped by some BLACK pervert?"" what the fuck!!!! why would he have to be black why couldn't he fucking be white, mexican, indian, native american, middle eastern, asian, canadian, why the fuck did he have to say black? fhluvzgh ureahfjkeahcuirf it pisses me off so fucking bad.

"event","yeah right... I used to be able to make myself believe that, but not anymore. I wish I could be happy. I'm so sick of lying to everyone, including myself. It's funny how my friends see me as that girl that is really happy all the time. You know the one I'm talking about. The one that even after her whole world falls apart, she still manages to keep a smile on her face and look on the bright side. 

But that's not me. Sure I may act like it. But I'm sick of acting. I'm constantly wearing a mask and i hate it. For a while there I was fooling myself. But it's not working anymore. 

to tell the truth, most of the time when I am smiling, it's to keep from crying. I was always told growing up to smile. You'll look prettier if you smile. Don't let the bully see you cry, it'll just make them stronger. But if the bully sees you smile, it'll make them weaker. So I always smiled. Because if I smiled it would make the bad things and the sad things go away. Even when my uncle tracy died I heard ""ok cassie, don't cry, you have to be strong for aunt debbie and tiffany and ashley."" I wasn't even allowed to show my emotion when my godfather died. But the truth is, just smiling and putting on that mask, all it did was push those emotions deep, deep down into the core of me and now that's all I can feel. the mask is wearing away and it's getting to be almost impossible to hide behind. 

I just feel so alone lately. But it's my fault. I dunno. I just think i need a long vacation. Maybe a permanent one."

Yeah I have the best friends in the world! So I was having a bad day, I couldn't even smile. And most of you know how I can smile on cue and make it look real, but I couldn't even do a fake smile. Then Lucy and Chauntae brought me flowers at work. It made me so happy. I dunno lately I've been feeling really down and that just made me feel good. It made me feel like someone actually wanted me around. It's the first nice thing anybody has done for me in a while. I just wanna say thank you so much.

"event","I know this may seem a little soon, but I am in love with Tony. I've loved him for years, but I've never been able to admit it to myself. When I'm with him I feel so-I don't even know how to describe it. I feel whole, I feel like I have everything just by having him. Most of all, I just feel so happy, but the real happy, not the fake kind that I've felt all of my life. He makes me want to live. He makes me want to wake up in the morning and face the day. I feel like a new person. He brings out the good in me. He makes me feel special and smart. He makes me feel real. But doesn't have me up on a pedestal, and I love it. I am so happy now, it's scary. But I like it. He's my penguin."

"event","Lucy and I went to Phantom of the Opera tonight. It was so wonderful. I loved it. I can't wait to go see another play or opera. I love the theatre. It's so great. I can't wait to move to New York. Then I can go to Broadway shows. It will be great!"

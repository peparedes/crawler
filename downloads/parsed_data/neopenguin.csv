i went to florida so this weekend was pretty good. not as good as i had hoped because i did not even get to see most of the people that said they would but that is okay i got to spend a lot of time with emily and alicia.  i did get to see amanda and i did get to see danielle for about half of an hour.  i did not get to see mark or nam or ryan or anyone else.  which sucks.  i saw zack and jordan for a little bit though which is better than not seeing them at all i suppose.  with everyone soon going off to college i bet i will not get to see a lot of these people again for a long time.  unless they go to the same school as me, but even then...

the breakthrough i thought i was approaching never came.  or maybe it did and i just missed it. i'm not sure any more.

new york is soon."

Now I will inform you all of the five most useful items ever.  The first is the stove top because you acn cook anything on it.  The second is the exacto knife because it is god's gift to people for having to cut things apart. Paper, plastic, thin metal, even LIMBS AND FINGERS this thing will eat through them.  The third is electrical tape.  It is five hundred times better than duct tape and much cheaper. Anyone who tells you ""duct tape is the best thing ever"" is living Hitler's illusion.  You too can stop the inhumainty.  Four is coffee. It must be a cure-all of some sort. Other than that I just felt like putting it on the list.  The fifth is the pop-tart because it feeds millions of hungry people every day, and is always fresh.  The only gripe I have with the pop-tart is that there is one smashed in my floor.  And that is billy's fault. I swear.

Lately I have done nothing but schoolwork and contemplation.  I am close to a breakthrough I think.  My monitor is now officially covered in post-it notes.  Every one of you probably has one on here. All 3 of you.  Us.  The universal we.  We had an interview with the USC admissions officer and blew his mind.  He likes us and thinks we are impressive.  We hope NYU thinks the same of us.  However, our anticipation will be held until December-or-so.

tomorrow i get to see ken burns talk at greensboro college. i hope i can ask him questions. man the triad is like a movie hot spot lately... four articles on film in 2 weeks have made front page of our paper... yesterday, while eating at mexico, i saw an indie film actor from winston and there were some other film related people that i do not know with him.  i am pretty much done with my application process now i just have to mail it all in. sweet relief.

a few weeks in math class we saw this weird graph, and i am sure its something that no one is able to understand its paterns. i think its a model for reality. every point, they influx in the same exact pattern, but those patterns are part of a bigger pattern and so on and son on. you can look at the graph on any scale and it looks exactly the same.  i bet the universe is like that if you stood far enough away. and if you zoomed in far enough on every particular cell, on every particular atom it would still look the same.  how can there be a limit on the extent of the number of levels that can exist anyways?  WHY would it exist?

i am gonna be in florida in about 3 weeks or so. whenever thanksgiving is - that tuesday of that week. o-town isnt ready."

"event","wow it has been awhile.  sorry 'bout that.

the impromptu film society thing is meeting again this weekend on saturday at five. same thing as last week and the one before that. people should come it'll be... (insert adjective)

i have a stack of 8 movies i am in the process of watching and i think we'll pick one of them.  i don't have much to talk about besides film. no wait i do.  the communist party sent me activist papers again but no card yet.  bastards.  oh well. i get the communist newspaper again!

applications are hell. i am writing an essay right now for them.  sometimes i feel this fear towards the whole process like i am doomed no matter what i do.  that is most of the time.  then i sometimes feel that i am going to get in and have a little bit of confidence.  some other times i just feel apathetic to the whole thing.  SCHOOL is what i really feel apathetic about.  i am totally disillusioned with high school at this point.  we really don't need it. hey here's an idea! lets combine the worst aspects of middle school and elementary school, take away all the good things, and throw them all together.  oh wait thats HIGH SCHOOL. 

whoa i need to calm down.  ironically, i am just writing in the essay about how jack kerouac made me a more mellow person.

if livejournal is pointless if its for rants, pointless if its for just saying what you did in the day, what is it for? just... self thought projected? deep philosphical writings?

i think it just is. and thats all we can say for it."

i saw a movie last night, donnie darko.  it was an incredible movie and it really opened me up to some realizations. the only problem is that it also made me very sad about my life.  i watched a music video of a song that is at the end of the movie a few times afterwards and i could just feel this sadness flowing through my veins.

"event","A crazy week it has been.  I have spent most of it at band, school, and doing homework.  I also have had an SAT class on some days.  *sigh*  The hours drip away into nothing, then reappear in my dreams in a twisted, obscure version of a truth I never understood in the first place.

Friday we had band at the football game, preceeded by a pep rally at the end of school.  I was completely energyless by the time it was all over.  It really stressed me out for some reason.  I must have too high of expectations or hopes or dreams or something.  We will never be good.  I should just face this.  The band from the other team never did show up.  (and to think I was afraid we would be totally humiliated by their skill)

Saturday is a different story.  My neighbor Thomas ""billy"" Reaves and I attended the CCGA LAN Party in Charlotte.  We had to leave at an ungodly time in the morning, half awake and hyped up for a day of maddening computer gaming.  And caffeine abuse.  Lots of caffeine abuse.  We got there with no trouble (besides traffic, stupid drivers, and a sign that said it was 155 degrees outside).  The LAN lasted all day, and Billy was the total pimp of Battlefield 1942.  I, on the other hand, got my ass handed to me in every game except Battlefield, which I did ok.  :]

In the end, I ended up winning a CD cleaner as a door prize... lol.  Billy got a L337 alienware hat with the alienware logo on it.

The ride home was incredible.  We drank more caffeine, and listened to Bright Eyes very loud.  I sung and screamed lyrics along.

Now I am coming down off of the insane amount of caffeine and the busy school week.  What does tomorrow have in store for me? Church, SAT class, homework.

The real question, however, is what does tomorrow have in store for you?"

No time w/ school and band.

Speaking of band I had not band because of voting or something.  I have a ton of tests this week though, so they balance out anyways.  *sigh*

I feel down right now but I don't even know why.  It is just an emotion; purely an emotion.

"event","I'm not even sure what is up with my life right now.  I would rather not complain about it online; i would rather not broadcast it out to everyone.  It is just that I have not updated in a while and I have nothing else to say.  I just feel like such an outsider at school.  I never have anything to say in class or wandering the halls at lunch... I just sit there with whatever random clique i decide to sit with that day.  I never feel like I belong with any of these people, like I don't fit in.  I just don't feel the same as they do about things... I only fit into certain parts of other groups.  So I am left to wander between them.  I wish people in band here actually cared about it like I do.  I am really enthusiastic about marching band, yet no one else cares.  Therefore, we suck.  No discipline and  no creativity.  No ambition.  We could be so great; we really are talented musicians, it's just that no one really has their heart in marching band.  Another problem with this is a lack of funding.  Those bastards downtown won't pay for extra instructors.  With just one band director and no one else, it is hard to run the ENTIRE band.  Especially with a VERY LARGE drumline that could be so so so so so so so so talented if we had the right instructor.  

I think marching band is the one place I actually do feel like I belong;  however, this is only when we are practicing.  Once the music stops and everyone is talking, I go back to feeling distant.  

In non-depressed me news... I got a messenger bag.  It is gray and black, with a Union Artillery, 1st Division patch; a fight club pin; a DCI pin [i made it myself!!]; and a get up kids pin I stole from Janelle with her permission.  It's very awesome.  I wish I could show it to you [that is if you aren't someone that goes to my school or has seen it].  It can hold 4 of my 8 notebooks for school.  I have to carry the other books and notebooks or put the in my locker [damn IB].

I am going to quit my Medal of Honor clan because no one there likes me, they all refuse to tell me when practice is or when matches are or what server it is on.  I really tried to be involved but no one took me seriously.  The same thing is happening with a JK2 clan I am trying to get in.  They won't tell me when tryouts are; they just avoid me.

It was fun though.  I got to go to the Dudley vs. South East football game before that, with two fellow drumline members.  We filmed the Dudley drumline and field show.  Crazy High-Steppers.  :[]

I returned to my Aunt's house after that and I went to sleep on a couch.  I was woken up many times during the night by this dog that really liked to run and jump on me and then lick my face.  argh!  It wasn't even there dog! It was their neighbor's! It was staying at their house... dammit.

I got up the next morning (it is still pouring outside, as it has done for almost a week now) and went home.  My parents finally got back.  Yey.  I downloaded the Unreal Tournament 2003 beta test... that is not supposed to be publicly available.  Yey for piracy!  :P

I also found out that I am supposed to beta test ANOTHER game.  argh.

My sister made cake and it was very yummy.  :[]  
I also learned how to put images in forum posts... and hmm my computer just died.... the other one...  Weird.  Damn that overclocking!

I went to drumline after school... well Band practice actually.  It was OK.  I am convinced of our band director's lack of authority, control, and sanity, though.  He can't keep anyone in line.  It sucks.  *sigh*

Plus the fact that our show music sucks.... whatever.

I found my robot pin which will now be modified to feature a COLOR robot.  Yay for robots.  and pins.  and crayons!! Crayons are the one cool thing in my bookbag.  :[]

My classes are very tedious.  Blagh.  I apologize for the sporatic-ness of this entry.  It's all fragment-full.  With lots of these-things that go like-this.  Because-they-can.  What do you call that anyways? Compound words I think? :-/

I need to find a rad icon for my livejournal, forums sig, etc. but I cannont find the picture i took right when i got my glasses... that cool one in blue w/ the wind effect.  [a sad attempt at art...]

I don't have to go play at the football game on Friday, which is too bad because marching band is the one time when I can let go of all of my troubles and let it just... slide.  Do any of you -readers- who are in marching band feel the same way?

Also, I found an old MP3 disc of mine last night and it is one of my favorites.  Loaded with Ben Folds Five and Phish.  And even The Greatful Dead (!)

Its... very Greensboro.  It reminds me of Hunter and Dylan.  And my Freshman year. (ah, I miss the great lunch table... *sigh*)

"event","I have to write this entry before the day is over because I have to go to the airport to pick up some guy that was living with my stepbrother in Costa Rica.  Or something.  Today was pretty boring.  I went to school, and it was raining for once.  It felt really nice to just drive through the rain at really early in the morning for my 0-period (before school starts) class.  I was listening to some Ibiza CD.  Billy was there, too.  I always give him a ride to school and a ride home when I am going home instead of drumline/band/etc.

So at school I was piled down with work again [such is life in IB]  and I went to drumline after school.  We started learning some new cadence that Jake, a veteran member that is now in college, wrote.  It was really odd.  I don't like it very much.  I had to leave early to go to the doctor to get a check up on my anti-depressant pills.  Blah.  Pills suck.  If I could fight a war it would be against pills and.... I forgot.  Dammit.  I had this all planned out.  :-/

*notice how the 2 songs on my current music are in alphabetical order... ah the power of mp3*

ANYWAYS! So I went to the doctors office at Five.  At Six Thirty, I finally went in.  In the meantime, I finished almost all of my homework.  Yey!  Isn't that weird?  Normally I don't do homework until the day it is due.  I guess this a new me.  :P

I came home and ate some pasta.  Pasta owns j00.  End of thought."

"event","Ah another weekend has disappeared.  At least band went *okay* on Friday.  I cleaned out my car today, which has been really dirty because of the insane amount of transportation I have been giving to people on drumline.  And we are very messy.  Heh.  My car is all sparkly and shiny inside, but we are on ""water restrictions"" due to the drought here, so I am not allowed to wash it.  Plus, I don't like paying for a car wash because... thats just a waste of money.  I can go with a dirty car for the sake of the environment and seven dollars.  Plus, the pay-for car wash would be wasting just as much, if not more, water.

I had a ton of homework and still have some left to do.  This is the trouble IB gives you.  I am in IB Environmental systems, which is cool since I want to be more environmentally consciencious.  I also have history ID's to do.  Eek.

Last night, my family had a huge dinner thing, and my family is really big.  So many people! Agh!!  It was fun though; I got to talk to Mauricio the Mexican foreign exchange student living with my Aunt.  He's the man. :P

Speaking of Spanish (heh)  my stepbrother, who is currently living in Costa Rica, got dissentery...  What a stereotypical disease to get in a Central American country.  How strange.  I find it humorous though... Oh well.

I hope that we get out of school early tomorrow from the heat... Not having A/C in your school sucks.  *sigh*"

I got to see Franco play at battle of the bands, they are a really great band.  Some of my friends are in them.  You should check their site out sometime.  I think it is franco.i85.net  (please correct me if I'm wrong Jordan or someone).  I got to spend a lot of time with Katie last weekend, which made me feel a lot better than I did the previous week, but coming back was just worse.  I am so bitter to everyone here, I cannot help it.  I feel so terrible here.  I am sorry everyone that is here, I am not an asshole to you because I want to be, I just feel so bad.  I am trying to be nice.  But this whole move thing has really messed with my head, I feel so much on the edge of just snapping.  Sorry eveyone.

Well nothing is new here really.  I got new CDs yesterday.  My car got the timing belt and the water pump replaced.  I am going to fix up the stereo and add cool air intake soon.  I should get the windows tinted, too.  They look really ugly all clear.  

I am going to start a band.  The whole rave thing is not really working any more.  We just got lazy and never bought any good vinyls.  Oh well.  No one in this city would ever appreciate it anyways."

It seems like the whole world has slowed down or disappeared.

Much of today has been spent driving around with my friends, trying to find them some drugs, and just general wandering into trouble.  I kept reflecting so much as I realized the connections between my old friends who now do drugs and everything.  It is so weird to look back at the people you once knew and see what they have become.  It is almost scary to see how much everyone changes, but then you just have to lay back and accept it as the world hands it to you.  Because that is all you can do.

I kept thinking about everything that has happened.  I am just sort of neutral with a bit of gladness about it.  And I have hope for the future.

I really would like to go into journalism.  We were talking about colleges when we were at the park and I think that was when I really really realized that journalism.

I would tell you about my day, but that would bore you.  I went to Friendly, to some druggie's house, to Leah's house, to get Ice Cream, to the grocery store to get caffeine filled superdrinks, and back home.  When at home, Janelle and I listened to music, stared at my glow stuff, and played guitar.  It was very fun.  It almost felt epic.  Maybe I was just tired, thoguh.  *sigh*"

I started reading Johnny Got His Gun two days ago.  I am almost done already.  It really is a powerful book.  (As if I did not hate war enough already....)  It will probably get me into numerous arguments with people.  Books that really cut deep into my mind do.  I wanted to get some other books, but this one had a very catchy looking cover (all black with hand showing the peace sign in white, with the shadow of a soldier standing in a field.)  I read the back cover and it looked very interesting, so I got it.  I can hardly put it down.

I have the writing test tomorrow, which is easy, so I will pass it.  That means no Exam for me in English!! Yay!!

The CD I am listening to, I downloaded multiple times, but I only got ""five minute long"" versions.  I listened to one all the way through anyways and it turns out to be the full CD!!!  I got upset at the fact that I could not find a really great breakbeat CD.  Then I had it, so I got happy.

Well before I leave, I am gonna give you two quotes:

Pi - Sol: ""Max, this is madness!""
      Max:  ""Or maybe it's genious!!""

Aqua Teen Hunger Force - Carl:  ""It's like my pool is tearin' ass in the backyard, but it's standing still..... Still waters run deep."""

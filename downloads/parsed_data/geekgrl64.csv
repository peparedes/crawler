"event","I work for a large corporation in Atlanta.  I happen to work in the HQ building which is 20 stories tall.  We occupy all floors but 3.  We used to be on the 4th floor, but were moved the 18th floor which require riding another set of elevators (bad building design IMHO).  Anyway, since having to ride the other set, I have noticed that the people who work on the 19th floor (not our floor) push the Close Door button on the elevator as soon as someone steps off.  It is the most annoying thing to me.  In fact, one person didn't even wait one day to see if anyone was waiting for the elevator that my arm was almost shut in the closing doors because I didn't have a chance to get on the elevator before the doors began to shut.  Since then, I have noticed that everyone who works on 19 pushes that damn button.  Just weird.  Is their work that much fun that they have to rush back to it?  Just wondering..."

"event","So today I had to take my car in to have it worked on.  The damn transmission gave a message that it needed to be worked on (I have a volvo, they tell you when they don't feel well).  So, rather than get to work on time, I had to traipse all the way to the dealership where I bought the car.  Grrrrrrr!!!  Bad start to a rainy day.

On another note, my mom is better and at home.  My dad won't leave her alone for any amount of time.  He is always there in case she needs something.  That is what 50+ years of marriage gets you.  Someone to worry over you when you are down and out.  She is annoyed by it, I think it is sweet."

"event","I was asleep.  Had been for 2 hours at least.  Actually, I had just woken up because my bladder told me to get up.  As I was walking back towards the bed, the phone rang.  The land line.  It was midnight.  No one calls at midnight unless it is an emergency, or at least, that is the way I see it.  I cursed and wondered who could be calling at midnight?  I was pissed.  I thought it might be a wrong number.  I picked up the phone and looked at the caller ID.  It was my dad's cell.  Oh shit.  I answered and immediately felt anxious.  It was my dad and he was calling to tell me that he and my mother were at the ER because my mother was not feeling well.  At that point his cell phone died.  Not great service in the ER.  My anxiety increased and tried to call him back several times.  All calls went immediately to voicemail.  Full blown panic set in.  I messaged him from my cell.  As I was calling 411 to get the number to the ER to have him paged, he called me back from a landline at the hospital.  He told me to stop talking so I would listen to him.  My mother had had a heart attack.  OMG!  She was in the catheterization lab as he spoke to me.  Come now...

So, I threw on clothes, left my beautiful child sleeping in the care of the canines and ran to my car.  20 minutes later I was at the ER getting escorted to the cath lab waiting area.  They were putting a stent in her artery.  Before the cath lab, down in the ER the doctor told my mom that she had had a heart attack and that she was in the best place that she could be for that to happen.  After the cath, the doctor told my dad and I that she was going to be fine, everything went well.  CCU x2 days, regular room x2 days and then home.  When I saw my mom lying on that gurney, I was so scared and felt immediately like a child again.  My dad looked so very, very tired.  It has been a strange few days.  

She is fine.  She has already been moved to a regular room, still in the cardiac area, but now she can be mobile without having to call the nurse to take off all the monitors.  She could very well go home today.  I truly hope so.  

Call your loved ones and tell them you love them."

"event","I am weak.  I have no strength when it comes to dealing with my beautiful son's father.  I cave to this man who continues to deceive me when I think he understands where I am coming from.  Now he has his wife in on the game.  Where do I get the strength to stand up to him?  When do I take the power away from him that I continue to give him?  He is not here for our child.  Every other Saturday and part of the day every other Sunday.  I get all the other time.  Which I adore.  I love my child.  He is the best part of that past relationship.  I pray that he doesn't become like his father.  It seems I can't have healthy intimate relationships with men.  I just screw them up."

"event","Is the root of all evil.  I know that it makes me crazy.  Especially when I don't have it and it is making me poorer.  I also hate the bank.  Yes ladies and gents, I am in dire straits financially and I don't know how I got here.  I don't remember buying the ticket or booking the trip.  When my monies get like this, I get especially stressed and lash out.  At the ones that I love.  I want to win the lottery.  Hell, I just want to win enough to crawl out of the hole that I find myself in.

"event","Well, I hardly ever post in here, but today I thought what the hell, right?  No one reads this except me :) although I have heard that someone read my single solitary post.  Things have been status quo as of late.  No overt fights with the significant other (yay!) just fights with the small human that has taken over my sweet child (pre-adolescence, ah the joy).  My honey is going away soon, just for a week, but I already miss him.  I know that he'll be back before I know it, but I still miss him when he is gone.  I also hope that he knows how much I love him and how sure I am of things working out for us.   I have faith.  

Well, almost time to hit the old time clock.  Another day down, 2 to go til the weekend.  Thank the gods! Be happy and safe to all who may hit this post.

Til next time....

"event","Wow, well here I go.  I don't know why I am posting to a live journal.  Maybe it will be a bit cathartic.  Lately life as a single parent has been a bit of a bitch.  I have an 11 year old rapidly hurling himself towards adolescence.  He is a brillliant child, tested into a Magnet program, tested into the highest math he can be in, and yet he is failing.  Is it because his father is moving away to another state?  He says no, but I am beginning to think otherwise.  Is it because his mom is on the verge of jumping into a relationship that she has been waiting for many years to happen?  He says no, that he likes the love of her life.  I just am at a loss for how to deal with him.  I get the attitude, the yelling and the looks of disgust that I know his dad does not receive.  Why is it the people that give you the most love and care are the ones that you hurt the most?  Is it because you know that no matter what they will always love you?

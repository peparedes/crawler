My mom's house doesn't have a comp, so I dunno when you guys will hear from me again. I'm gonna try and get her to get one, and I'll find an internet server for her tht's cheap. I'll be on when I can get onto a friends comp, and I'll catch up on comments then.


I love you guys, you're all freakin' awesome, and I'll post when I can.

Xmas was good, got a bunch of stuff, and Jayme said he'd buy me the tattoo I want on the back of my neck.

New Years was good too, got to chill in Ipswich with a bunch of people I haven't seen in a long time and used to see nearly everyday. I couldn't really drink though because I had gotten my tongue pierced, like, 2 days before, and alcohol wouldn't have felt too good.  But we all sat around and I watched the guys play Texas Hold 'Em and Jayme almost won, but Brad ended up taking the pot. Jayme had gotten real trashed and his bro kept beeping him on his phone to come and get him because he was in no shape to drive. And when we got to Jayme's, Jiggs got some one on one time with the toilet.

I miss everyone so friggen much- it sucks that I hardly ever see them anymore. And even though I'm moving back, I probably still won't cuz no one ever really called me except Amy. Probably cuz I don't have a liscense or a car, so it's harder for me to get there. But I walk to beverly from Peabody, it only takes like, an hour, and I love walking.

I dunno.


Peace bitches."

Well, he was Justin's, but you wouldn't know it cuz Justin was never here, so I ended up taking care of him. I miss him.

Jayme came home, and he left this morning. God, I already miss him so much. Had everyone over here last night, and got wicked drunk and had awesome sex. Then woke up and had awesome sex again. It's great when you wake up to your guy's hand between your legs. 

Sorry if that was too graphic. If you don't like it, don't read it.

"event","Eh. Today sucked.

1- I got up at 7 this morning after being up until 2 or 3(I dunno- I don't have a clock yet) to go to work and basically clean the store until 6 pm.

2- I'm coming down with a cold. My nose is running and my throat is sore. So I'm not a happy person.

3- Did I mention I had to basically clean the entire fucking CVS store?? And face everything?

4- Had to deal with a woman I work with be all pissy about my possible promotion because she has worked there for a couple years, but she still doesn't qualify to be Beauty Advisor. She bitched to everyone I work with, and they all basically told her to shut the hell up and deal with it.

5- I think i have a fever- and if I get sick, I have no insurance. So I'll just end up dying.

6- I don't think I'll be able to see alot of Jayme when he comes back for his Thanksgiving break, cuz my manager doesn't like giving people time off. Which I guess is understandable, cuz of the season and shit, but it still sucks. I'll have to talk to her about it and explain that he's in <b>Pennsylvania</b> and i never see him.

7- I went from being a lazy fuck and sitting on my ass all the time, to working all the time and getting next to no sleep. That's probably why I'm getting sick.

Aside from that, when Kim was talking to the people at Piercing Pagoda(one of those small little shops in the middle of the mall, and also directly acroos from CVS) I was looking at the shit inside Spencer's, and some guy started talking to me. He looked 20. Anyway, he was talking to me about random shit and asking me all sorts of questions(although the bf question never came up, so he'll be in for a little surprise). He asked me if I wanted to play pool sometime, and I was like ""Yeah sure"". I figure, I work all the time, and it'll be nice to have someone to hang out with. Most of my friends are guys anyway. So we traded numbers. I told Kim if he called tonight, to tell him I was sleeping tho. Cuz I don't want to have to deal with that shit. And go figure- his name is Joe. What the fuck. I'm surrounded by guys named Joe. And if he starts showing up at work, I'll be pissed. Cuz that's real annoying. And a waste of his time. And mine.

I talked to my grandparents(cuz dad wasn't home, and I needed to give him directions to my house for tomorrow morning), and they are sending me a ton of stuff for the house and whatnot. My Grandmother also said that I should look for an envelope, which means money. she said it was for a specific purpose, but she wouldn't tell me. They're awesome.

But yeah, tomorrow my dad is coming to take me to breakfast and get the rest of my shit out of my mom's house. I'm gonna have him take me to the bank so I can open an account and kill time until we go to my mom's. I no longer have a key, so i need to go when they're home, and they work until 5.

Eh."

I used to live right next to Salem(30 seconds walking and I was there), and I used to be in Salem all the time. Well, the guy was interviewing a Witch, and the reporter was mocking him. It pissed me off so much.

Sorry, I had to vent."

So she hates me. And I hate her. So I went on another sn and fucked with her a lil bit. She had no idea who I was. It made me happier about today.   But anyway... off to get mah check."

"event","Awesome, Kim got a LJ. Even though I prefer DJ, but oh well. Jesus, I work so much now. Even though it's just CVS, standing for 8 hours kinda sucks. No- it <i>does</i> suck. Alot. And the shirt I have to wear makes me look stupid. My head manager is awesome though. I'm completely broke, and I can't afford to get work pants. So I've been wearing jeans. Today she told me the district manager is coming in on Friday and if I'm wearing jeans, he'll tell me to go home, because of the dress code. I guess he's a real ass fuck about it. So since I have no money until Friday or Saturday, she took me to Sears and bought me work pants. Dude, she's even gonna hem them for me cuz my legs are so fucking short!! She's friggen awesome!! And all the other peple are pretty nice too. Kinda wired... but nice.

Bleh.

"event","Ugh. I'm still tired from last night. The keg party started at like, 6, and I went to bed at 2am. It was great. 
I got home from work, and people were already here with Justin (he was already drunk). So I put on my makeup and did my hair. I got somethin to drink and Kim and Casey went to the store to get strawberries and whipped cream for the Strawberry Shots we were gonna do. We had the stereo going and Justin was dancing, and it was a goooood time. Kim and I made the Strawberry Shots for everyone. I had 5 or 6 of them. They're soooo good. I recommend them to anyone. You hollow out a strawberry, pour any alcohol of your choice(we used banana rum...mmm...) and top it with a little whipped cream. I got wicked trashed just because of those. They taste so good, you just gotta keep having them. I had some Smirnoff twists too.
There was some guy there (I think his name was Kevin) that kept talking to me and following me around. I told him about Jayme and even showed him a picture, hoping he'd get the hint- no such luck. An hour later, he was like, ""I know you have a boyfriend, but I really like you."" He said he was there with some girl, but he was trying to hook her up with some other guy. Well, after awhile of being really creeped out by this guy(Casey was taking pictures and Kevin came up next to me and put his arm around me and was like, ""Take a picture of us!!"" I can guarantee I wasn't smiling very nicely.), Casey knew I wasn't happy and he had one of his friends (who looks like he's Tom Brady's little brother or something!!) pretend to be with me. So Kevin saw that and started to be all over that girl he was supposedly trying to hook up with one of his friends, even though he had a fight woth her and called her a slut 10 minutes prior. And he kept trying to get me away from Casey's friend when he wasn't. *shudders* And it didn't help that he was creepy looking in the first place. Oh- and start the night off right, when Kim was in the shower, Kevin walked in on her, looked her up and down a couple times, then apologized.
And wen everyone went to bed, the few people that were staying the night downstairs were bitching cuz Kim and Casey were having drunk sex and Kim was kinda loud. Dude, it's their fucking house, they could have sex right there in the living room and you can't say shit.
Other than that, I had fun. I had a drunken late night phone call with Jayme. He was drunk too, so it was interesting. <3
I'll post pics if I can, and burn the one of me and Kevin. Ugh."

"event","Well. I did it, with my friends advice I've moved far from home and found a little flat in St Ives I'm renting, lucky for the money I've saved over the years. I have a job locally and am doind other stuff to bring in the pennies. I feels weird being so far from my family but good at the same time. I now have my PC up and running. Will be online some evenings so se how it goes. Thanks to AJBT and Kinc for their help. Will talk 2 u both soon, love Cass."

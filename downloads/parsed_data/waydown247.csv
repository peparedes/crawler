"event","hey lena, just wanted to remind you that you are only obligated to work when you are scheduled, and you do help everyone out there when you can, and it is also no one else's business how much you work or go to school!  ok, i just wanted to tell you that cuz i hate coming in to see you guys and hearing all this drama that should not be happening!  just be your extremely sweet self, don't let other people's drama/issues get you down for a second.  so, yeah i decided to break my not-writing streak to tell you that.  also, someday when im not working all day we have to hang out!  call me sometime if you want to do something! love ya!

"event","Bitchology


When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, 
they call me a bitch. 

When I stand up for those I love, 
they call me a bitch. 

When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or do 
things my own way, they call me a bitch. 

Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in 
my heart. It means I live my life MY way. It 
means I won't allow anyone to step on me. 

When I refuse to tolerate injustice and 
speak against it, I am defined as a bitch. 

The same thing happens when I take time for 
myself instead of being everyone's maid. 

 

It means I have the courage and strength to 
allow myself to be who I truly am and won't 
become anyone else's idea of what 
they think I ""should"" be. 

I am outspoken, opinionated and determined. 
I want what I want and there is 
nothing wrong with that! 

So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame, 
try to squash every ounce of beauty I hold 
within me. You won't succeed. And if 
that makes me a bitch, so be it. 

I embrace the title and am proud to bear it !!!!

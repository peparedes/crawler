Well....
i've met this amazing girl... She's better than anything i've ever come accross before. She's amazing, treats me well, and makes me soo happy just by being her. I can't believe i wasted my time trying to win someone who was crap, when a perfect  girls like this are out there...

I just... word's can't explain how wrapped i am to be with her.... Every morning i wake up, and have to pinch myself, just to check that it's real.

I hope it lasts forever.... 
I'm moving on.... Fuck the past... You had your chance to love me, now you can love someone else... not that you already haven't......

I'm on cloud 9.... and i'm not coming down for a long LONG time...."

"event","My parents informed me lastnight that the day I move out is the day that they're lives will become easier...hmmm..that's wonderful isn't it? Let's tell our 17 year old daughter that we hate her living in our house even though she cleans it, does the dishes and laundry and is oh wait...never even there because she works all the time!! That's just wonderful. So I told them that it was fine with me and that the day that I turn 18 is the day that I'm moving out and I said ""So you've only got about 8 more months to screw with my live so I suggest that you take advantage of it"" So that was the wonderful night I had. Anyway, I'm out of here. I'll write more later."

I'm starting to hate my job, I'm suprised that it took me this long to figure this out. It's not that it's hard, just really long hours. But I guess this is what they call ""The really working force"". I do love the people that I work with, granted there are those few that I absolutely can't stand but you'll find that anywhere I suppose.
Prom is less than three weeks away, this is my 3rd prom, sad really. I'm somewhat excited but not as much as I was with my first prom, I've spent more money on this prom then I have spent in probably the last 6 months. We stil don't have a plce to go eat but we'll figure out something. 
The people in my town have gotten more rediculous in the past few months then I ever thought possible. More drama and rumors and crap are floating around this town then freakin air. It's Pathetic.

I need to get going though, I'll post later sometime. I'm off the next 2 days so that will be nice. Bye"

"event","Alright not too much has been going on lately. For the next 3 weeks, I've got 2 days off of work. I am going to be extremely tired and cranky but it's money of which I need right now so I probably shouldn't be  complaining. 
We got a new dog 2 days ago she's only 7 weeks old but she's kept me up until 3 a.m. the past 2 nights so I'm running on very little sleep, I think I'm actually only running on adrinalin (sp?) right now which I don't really know what's going to happen when that runs out but we'll see.
The boyfriend is spectacular what's really nice is he hasn't said the ""L"" word yet which I told him not to until he was sure I also told him that I was really in no hurry to hear it. He is as sweet as can be so it's very nice. 
I'll hopefully have some new pictures up soon we'll see when I can tear myself away from work to do it.
Well, I had better get going just thought I'd give a quick update.

Or what if he just wants to be friends?? Or what if I'm just a stupid paranoid girl who needs to just shut up and see what happends??? All I know, is that I'm excited and I hope this works out because with my last 2 relationships, I kinda just jumped right in which well...sucked but this time I'm not doing that I'm getting to know him and all that good stuff. All of our mutual friends that I have talked to all say that he's a good guy. I work with his Step-sister and she says that he's a good guy too. She doesn't know that we're going on a date yet so she'll be really excited! I know I am :-D
I really hate computer tech, this class is so worthless seriously. Oh well, it gives me time to update all of you beautiful people about what's going on.

26 Days until my birthday which means that it's a year and 26 days until Dee gets to come kidnap me. Haha we pretty well freaked out Ian with that whole thing, but by the end of the other night, he was full in on the plot and even planned out my entire travel route. Haha. 

Well, that's about all from me for now but I will be sure to update either tomorrow night or on saturday to let you know how my date goes. Wish me luck!!! *muah* love you all!"

I am now boyfriendless...I don't really like it but I'm learning to accept and adjust. Andrew still means so much to me and hopefully with time things will work themselves out but for right now this is how things have to be.
I miss everyone on here, I don't get around to doing this nearly as often as I should. But I love you all and thank you for sticking with me in all of my times of absense. I hope everyone's lives are un-complicated and happy. 
I've got another hour in this class. GAH it's so torturing! 
I got a new job about a month ago and it's a good job, I've met a lot of new and awesome people, unlike Dillons you actually get to know the people you're working with and you hang out with them outside of work. I hang out with a number of people that I work with. The only complication is that I work with Andrew, I know it's an awkward situation for both of us but we both do our job and do the best we can to seperate work and relationship (or lack there of). Other then that, school pretty much takes up the rest of my time. We haven't had much school here recently. I think in the past 4 weeks or so I've been in school about 9 days but that's including Winter Break which was two weeks and we went through an ice storm which got us out of school for 2 days then I was sick another day I keep getting sick it's one thing right after the other and it's starting to get frustrating because I have to keep trying to make up stuff and my make up work just piles up every day and we just got done with a 4 day break. So I haven't really seen much of this place recently but hey who am I to complain? Hopefully the grades will come out better with this semester. Erik was dissapointed with me, I failed my first semester Algebra 2 class, which I shouldn't have and I really could have avoided it but I think that lack of concentration and laziness showed it's ugly head. But hopefully things will be better for me. Everytime my life seems to calm down something happens to stir it back up again. Oh well. We'll see what happens. Well, that's all from me for now. Talk to you all later.

"event","Well lets just say that everything is wrong but everything is right at the same time. I grow very tired of dealing with all the ""drama"" that goes on in this stupid town. 
Current Situation: Here's a little Story....

1)I've got a new boyfriend
2)He has an ex-girlfriend
3)Parents made them break up
4)He still cares about her (wasn't a mutual break up)
5)She turns 18 in two months so they're free to be together if they want
6)I'm freaking out
7)this really sucks...
8)But he's with me right now
9)two months is a long time
10)Things can change...
11)who knows....

Knowing me it's a big possibility that I am blowing this entirely out of proportion and it's really not as mad as it seems. But of course people are talking crap (hence the outburst paragraph ^) which is making things much much worse, while my boyfriend and I are attempting to ignore everything that people are saying it's growing hard, it's stupid really. I love him, he loves me. I'll guess we'll see what happends...a day at a time....blah...I know what everyone says ""If he really loves you everything will be alright"" or ""Everything will work out how it's meant to"" I really hate it when people say that, I really really do. This is a tricky thing...hmm...

However, my classes are a different story. I've been sick for awhile and well..I'm very behind on things. Maybe one of these days I'll actually wake up and realize that I have to do something. It's terrible. I don't really feel like taking summer school. That would suck. As long as I can keep up my Algebra 2 grade, I'll be fine. That's really the only class that I have to worry about right now. 

Well, I'm sick. So I'm going to go upstairs, make some soup and lay down. It's snowing so that should help make me feel better.
Anywho, I'll talk to you all later!

"event","I finally have a minute to sit down and write something. My uncle passed away and needless to say it's been very very difficult. No one really ""expects"" death, some may, but I sure didn't. He had cancer and it only 2 short months it beat him. Now we're one of those families who lost their ""battle with cancer"" gah I hate that term...battle with cancer...what does it mean anyway? 
There are so many flowers and cards and Food oh my gosh I have never seen so much food in my life! 
I don't know...by now I am just completely sick of the whole suprise death concept...this is the 8th time I've been through all of this just in the past year. 
My grandfather (uncle's father) doesn't know yet... he recently had heart surgery and there is no possible way that we could tell him without sending him to the grave himself (as awful as that sounds) and it's tearing me apart, he doesn't even know his own son has passed...they were never really close and the worst part of it is, during the last few months of my uncle's life neither one of them knew the seriousness of eachothers conditions. They had been trying to get closer these past few years but then things just kind of took a turn for the worse I suppose you could say. 
I miss him very much, he my my closest and most beloved uncle and I will miss him more than words can say..but I've found out through this past year that I cannot sit here and cry for the next year as I did in time past.

On a bit better know, my dear boyfriend's brother will be married soon so we are all headed up to ohio for a week for that celibration. I'm very excited actually,  I've never been to Ohio before so it will be a new expierience for me. 

Well...I suppose that is about it for now, I'm not very good at keeping this thing up to date and I'm very sorry. I feel awful because Erik thinks I die just about every month, I'll try and do better but I can't make any promises!!"

Oh man, I am so sorry everyone.

Well I am officially a junior. It's craziness. I worka  lot to being th reason why I am never on the computer. I do think of you guys I promise I do. I hope you don't think I died or anything. 

My boyfriend and I just celebrated our one year about a little over a month ago. It's nice being with someone that long. My friends all seem to think that Kyle and I will ""tie the knot"" right after my 18th birthday. That's a nice thought I will admitt. 

My mother wants to take a family vacation to Oklahoma City...I'm not really sure why because well...I can't stand my family atleast not in a confind space like that anyway. She only wants to be gone for a couple of days but even that is going to feel like FOREVER. 
Anyway, I need to get going. I have to go to work and what not so I'll talk to you all later! :-)"

"event","So yeah, apparently I do nothing in my classes and I'm failing because I don't give a crap. Right...it's my goal to have my parents pissed off at me every two seconds. I hate people, no not all people. Just stupid people. 
I've been sick a lot and come on everyone knows how hard it is to keep up with everything. GAHH!!!!
I don't know, they get mad when I try and get all of my crap done and I don't do it good enough and they get mad when I don't do anything at all. And by ""they"" I mean my parents. 

I turn 16 in 5 days, Dee that's one year closer until you can kiddnap me. I'm still holding you two that don't worry!!! :-P

I'm sitting here in school because I don't feel like going home yet.

I don't care about anything anymore I really really don't. 

I'm sick all the time now, always. I lost 9 pounds in 6 days, I stopped eating. I didnt' even take in 2500 calories in that time period. It was quite sad. I was so depressed.

my mom kept tryiong to fit me into prom dresses lastnight and it was really starting to piss me off. She kept picking up all of these saying ""Oh this one looks cute"" Finally I told her to just leave it the fuck alone...then she stopped. 

Erik where are you at now a days?? I talked to you not to long ago on aol but I haven't heard from you since. What's your aol name these days?? Mine is on a prior post if you want it.


Well I think that's it for me for now. I'll talk to you all later. Ta Ta"

"event","It's kind of strange, I can never seem to dig far enough into my head to pull out the words that I really want to say. I have three years and 9 weeks left in high school and I feel as though I've fucked myself over for life. Just this ""stunts"" I've pulled off so far this year I mean my god this isn't me. So yeah there are the things in which I haven't given into yet such as drinking, and drugs. Yetthere are still those dumb fucks who think that I go and get high and drunk every weekend. Damn, I am through screwing up my life in order to keep others sane. Sometimes I wish I was rain...just fall not worrying about where I land because it wouldn't matter. I would soak into the ground and never be seen again. That wouldn't be so bad. I was sitting on my front porch earlier today and it was raining and it has been rainging for 3 days now but for some reason today it seemed like it was raining for me, like today was supposed to be a day that I could replenish myslef. I remember a thought I had a long time ago about how I could tell what hte rest of the year would be like by the first day of it. I'm still deciding if I was wrong with that or if I was right. So far this year I've learned what being a friend is and who my friends really are and I've learned what exactly I want in a guy and Brian appears to be that guy. :-/ Good Lord I look at people like my sister for example maybe because she is so confident everybody think's she's fine but she's not. Deep down she can't be happy but she covers it up better than anyone I've ever seen. I've never seen her laugh without the smile being fake first. 
    Alright I'm done boring you all now. I'll talk to you all later. I miss you all and I am very sorry I haven't written in a long time, I talked with Erik today for the first time in awhile hehe he was worried if I was still alive or not :-P no worries I'm still here just very busy. I'll post whenever I get the chance I promse :-)"

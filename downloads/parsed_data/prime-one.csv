"event","I hate teenagers.. including myself... why did I ever have this journal? So my ex little prissy gf would have a way to make sure she had me under her control!She WAS SUCH A CONTROLLING BITCH! No one take this serious because life is much more wasted if you care what people think of you that you really don't even like. Im just pissed because no matter how ""mature"" people are they are still going to do fucking stupid things. LIKE MAKE JOURNALS SO THEY CAN ""OPEN UP"" and share their lives with their ""friends"". If they are your friends they should already know what's going on. This should be my last post on here. I really do hate this thing..and myspace. stupid fucking trends and me following them. Not so I can ""be cool"" but because I was BORED AS HELL! I care for my gf alot but the fact of the matter... 95% of teenage relationships are a waste of time. Im not saying that 95% will not last, probally only a rare 2ish % will. Congrats, you beat the odds! 
Emo math!

If 1 emo trendy child kills themself, how many others will?

Answer...none because they dont give a fuck about you, and they will ""cut to feel""

Yay, math is fun!

So for those who really do care about what I say, sorry if this hurt you but it's true. I'm stupid so it is ok. Hope this Journal was fun for all of you!!!

Much Love,
Eric"

"event","Been getting really depressed again.. not sure why. I absolutely love being with my gf. She really helps me feel better. I've been wondering about why Im still like this. Maybe Im stressed out about what's going to be happening this week. I really hate feeling this way. Hollie and I talked some. We are on normal terms, but for now I have her blocked. I don't think right now it would be right for me to talk to her. Too much going on with me. I really hate feeling the way I do.. I keep wondering if I should be with her. She is so wonderful.. I really don't think Im good enough with her most of the time. I'm not going to be stupid and break up with her because of how I feel though. I will let her do it if she isn't happy..I really hope she is. I love her alot because she is my best friend..dont worry Im not ""In Love"" yet... I felt weird saying I love her because I'm her first bf... but it makes me so happy hearing it. Gah... Im dumb.. sleepy.. and I miss her. I'm being emo.


On a different note, I got my sin to lvl 35. When I get lvl 40, Im going to get new throwing claw, and make it +7, that that will be around 600K... my mage will be poor. Then he is going to wear his new hat, and I still need to get his shoes, those shouldn't be to bad to get. Im not sure if I should get lvl 40 on him or get my mage to 50. Then Ill have cash to spend if I do that. I guess Ill choose when my mage is unbanned...stupid nubs... I was afk...bastards.

"event","Im pissed off. During spring break my mom and I were going to go visit Crystal and her family. Well Crystal and I were talking and I told her nothing sexual would happen. As I tell her this, she pretty much tells me that I shouldn't even come then. Makes me feel like shit because appearently the only reason she wanted to see me was to do stuff. I wanted to just hang out with an old friend, try her New ddr pad, see her town, and relax in a hot tub because hot tub would be :drool: awsome. Makes me thing if the only reason she wanted to see me was because of that, then why was she with me before. GAH! I try to tell her that I wouldnt let anything happen and I just wanted to hang out and joke around, and she just blocks me. Guess she really only ""loved"" certain things about me.

On another note.. Ive been happy lately other then :points up:. Ive been really tired, but its ok, I think Im not use to going to school. Sorry if people are wondering whats going on with me. Right now I can't say much. One thing I can say, Bj, its not what you think ( if I know what your thinking). Ill tell everyone soon-ish. Just need some time. I played MS for the first time in like forever... game is so dumb...

Happy Easter Everyone!

It sucked that a few of my plans this weekend didn't go how I hoped or just didnt't happen. Joshys Gf is short,I thought she was tall and it was going to be her towering over him. Now I kinda know what they look like together,awwww cute ^_^

This weekend should be wonderful, can't wait till Saturday, makes me mucho mucho happy. Yesterday was wonderful, good day at school, no Ms. Berry so YAY! The day went off pretty well, Art was fun, worked on my drawing of these 2 birds on branches, I really really liked it till I messed up on 1 birds beek, Im still going to finish it though. Programing we had a sub,first part we went to some stupid duel credit thing for another area, didnt apply to me at all. Then we ate Sun Chips, Yummy ^_^, the second part, I found out that there is GBA games on the school comps, so I played some old school Mario. Then we had that Election thing to vote on, didnt vote, alot of the people didnt even seem to care much about winning. Then Lunch was very nice, ate a little and just was Happy. Berrys' was pointless, like normal.

So its Friday, it should be pretty awsome, no plans for tonight that I know of, but tomarrow Im pretty sure will be the best day Ive had in a long time, and Ill be all super happy, its weird to be like this again. I haven't been thinking about the past AS MUCH. That's very nice, just things are going to be weird in a bit. Yawn, I should shower, even though Im going to PE, idk, seems, pointless, but I dont want to be extra stinky. Wondering if Ill see the G'ma before she leaves, concidering I think she wants to watch ""Get Backers"" and Im like on ep 30 out of 49. I should maybe watch the rest tonight/tomarrow. Or Ill just put them on my comp then she can have them back and I dont have to watch all of them at a rush. Gosh... Weird being so happy. So if this is all secretive, but it wont be for long, so dont be mad everyone.

Funeral For A Friend
Title: Storytelling 


 
You say it's not going to work out
Why do you have to tell me now
Is there a difference in anything
You've said and done
Or is it just the way we've been pretending

I'm leaving
Do me a favour don't even think of me now
Just when you thought it was over
It had only just begun

I'm not going to let this tear me apart
She's not my only reason
He's not my only reason she said
You're a weakness to me
You should've sent me a note
Or wrote me a letter

I wish it was how we planned
Everything will work out
You said I hated you if only that was true
You should've said that he'd be happy now"

If you you want to come, your very welcome but got to find your own ride. ^_^

Bleeding is worse on a sad-er note, need to go to the doctor bout that soon.. scared kinda sense it will result in my ass being looked at closely by someone...heh seflesteem problems there. I might need surgery if it is that bad... not good -_-.

Well not much more to say, hurry up weekend, get to see Amber, that should be fun. I havent hung out with Nick  or Mike in a while to, so thats awsome too. Well thats bout all.

I have never stopped loving her and that is kind of a double sided blade, I realize that my feelings were and are real, but then I have to realize I wont have them again. The only way Ive wanted her back is as my friend, even when we werent together she made me happy. It was never just because we were going out, it was because she was my bestfriend. I should have known it wouldn't last, all the times she needed time away from me, time to deal with things. When we were first together, she would come to me to feel better and after a while she started to go to different people. It really sucks that something so wonderful can make you feel so empty. Im going to school but only for 5th period. I really dont know whats up with me but I feel like the world around me is moving but I'm just watching it drift away. My mom called the insurance company and got the name of people I can go to. It's hard to choose, and how am I suppose to by just their names. I guess I shouldn't worry, it's not my goal to open up to them, I just want the medication. I never really thought I would say that, I use to be so anti-meds but I've tried for a long time to just be happy and it never just happens anymore. I don't want a relationship like I've had before, I just want a bestfriend type gf... thats what makes me happy. I won't mind kissing some but I just want that person I can just go to and be happy. Well Im not sure what else to say, I guess Im just displaying myself on here hoping someone will just take this pain away, but not many people really read this so I guess that it is just a hope. I've been having thoughts of dieing alot, I just wonder why Im not afraid of it, I just dont understand. I think Ill start writing crappy poems again.. they are fun...

[Kelly]
How many times
Are you gonna apologize about the same thing
And how many times can I take you back
When I'm not the one that's doin' wrong
(When I'm not the one that's doin' wrong, yeah)
I thought maybe if I started prayin'
That we would get better, but
When I would pray the answer would always come back to me bein'
done
But we are so hard headed when we're in love
So I

[Chorus]
I told myself that I would make some changes
But the more I change there's one thing that remains the same 
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me
And everytime that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
But I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take his bad habit no more

[Kelly]
I'm totally out of my element
Learnin' new ways to live, while your in a comfort zone
Not even thinkin, (you couldn't think about me) to call 
And then when I get mad you buy me gifts 
Thinkin' it's gonna solve every issue
From the girl callin my phone, to the pictures that I saw
And every time you would break up with me for nothing at all
I've takin all I could take (I've takin all I could take)
But the way I live has gotta change, oh

[Chorus]

[Bridge Kelly]
Let me break it down
Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you was just to blind to see
Past, all of the pain they was causin' you
Ladies do you feel me (do you feel me)
Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you went against the right things that you should
do
Then it's time to make a change
So I

[Chorus]"

I've been shaking for a while, stomach has been weird lately, and back has been acting like it's out. I'm really thinking that I'm one of those weak people that needs a relationship to be happy. I hate feeling like that but even since I had the experience of being with Hollie, things just dont seem as good without her being part of my life. I know that Ive said this before.. so Im sorry. I just kinda figure no one really reads it or much cares. I really wish she didn't hate me like she does... she wont even give me 5 mins of her time so I can feel like I wasn't completely worthless to her. I guess she isn't as good of a person anymore. She doesn't care at all.. why would I exspect her to... she hasn't cared about me for a while.. so I guess I have to realize that. I'm still unsuer what to do... I miss just being close.. and feeling ok. I really miss feeling ok inside. I just wodner why things had to change... I still do even now.. why I dont feel like trying when everyone else does. I dont't have the feelings of wanting to try. All I really feel like doing is sleeping.. and just hoping that Ill just end up going away. I don't really see why I'm here. No one really needs me.. I feel empty inside like all the time.. and I can't stop loving her. I hate it so much... I hate myself. I know must people will ignore this but sorry to the ones that waste their time reading it...

"event","Going over to Hollies right now... probally going to go out with a 18y ear old that Ive known for like 3 years. Very attractive, fun person to be around, and she actually likes me lol. I've made out with 3 people at the bowling ally now. I'm probally going to go to narrows tomarrow. Im tired as heck. If I dont go out with the girl, we have already kinda thought that it will still be more then friends type of thing Im pretty sure. Going to go see her maybe tomarrow if not then on Wed. Woot Eric gets some..more. Well off I go.. maybe head to the mall afterwards.. so boring but not much else to do. Well Ill update later. Maybe say how things went.

"event","Tomarrow being wed. Im going to go over to Hollies and get my item. She doesnt pick up phone, or call back, so Im just going to finish this. I didnt go to school today because I was too tired. I havent got like any sleep lately, Ill go to bed around 11 but It always seems like Im more tired when I wake up. I really hope she doesnt hate me for showing up but I just need to done with. I just need to just have closure... she didnt give it to me last time. I figured out who she likes/wants to be with Im pretty sure, concidering he wouldnt say anything back to me. Ironic how so many times you can be told that it will never happen, they are just their friends... This makes me understand that she isnt completely right in the head.. how she abandons people so quickly.. how she can change her mind. I was just another toy for her. Well soon enough this will be done with.. Time to lay back down.. still very tired..

"event","Im so tired of feeling sick... my heart constantly is acheing and throbbing... I cant control my thoughts always throwing myself into a depressed state.. even if I was in a good mood. The only time I feel happy is when Im with my friends, but alot of the time even then does help.. and alot of the time people are busy or cant doing anything or dont want to. Im going to talk to my mom about the doctor thing again tonight.. I really need to start meds.. I dont think this is a temperary thing.. Ive tried to jsut deal with it, Im not strong enough.. I really just want someone that will be there for me. Im tired of seeing people have wondeful things and not even realize it.. like great friendsships.. I always seem to throw mine away.  I just wish I wasnt so damn needy.. I constantly seem to be depressed... I want someone I can cuddle with and talk... I dont care about other things.. I dont want to be a swinger.. I just want to stop feeling like shit.. try new things. Games are not nearly as fun as they use to be.. Im so tired of feeling like there is nothing to do. I have everyone blocked on MSN right now... just dont want to yell at people for no reason. I just want to have a bestfriend like I use to..is that too much to ask...

"event","Not sure what to say really. Im going to go finish whatever is left with Hollie. I still love her but I really think that she isnt the same good person she use to be, so it is best if I dont be friends with her. I should be going to the doctor again soon, my mom is trying  to get the insurance to pay for the person I saw before, Im going to start higher dose meds when I go back. I hope they help. Ive been really just idk, weird feeling. I find it hard to really think about anything other then the problems. I just want to be able to handle this stuff again. I really hate not being able to stay happy. The thing is I can be happy now, it came at the expence of me being kinda a asshole but hopefully I can learn to be nice again. Well thats about all.. just wondering what recent events will change into..

"event","I have been in quite a weird mood lately, the more I just forget about thigns, the more angry I seem to get at people. I really think Im not able to be really close to people. Its like a fear I cant make go away, I guess its ok, when your get committed you can get hurt. Ive been really tired recently too. ON a more positive side, I get to hang out with Crystal, that should be fun, I was going to try and give the note to Rachael myself Im thinking..Ill just try to see her walking home and just kinda give it to her. I've been making alot of plans to meet new people lately, hopefully it goes well, I need to find a new hobby, DDR kinda lost alot of what I called being special. Alot of good memories with it but it is ok, I dont dislike it at all, just wont go play large amounts. Im thinking of starting to watch an anime called ""The Getbackers"" maybe that will be good. Not much more to say, Ive thought alot about the gf thing, I want one, but I know I wont be able to love her. Im still undecided, still not sure if I could handle it again...not after all the BS I went through for ""love"". Kinda think I wasnt suppose to be in love, it was just a sick twisted joke by someone. I just think that Im tired of being so...fucked up ^_^ best way to say it. Well, if you want to maybe do something this weekend, E-mail me. Thats bout all I guess...

"event","You always leave Hollie... you could never give me a chance...I was a wonderful bf..and you tried me like shit..you draged me around in the mud. You made me feel like shit for so long..you did everything you promised you wouldnt.. you are a horiable person to me.. you  wouldnt give me a chance even when we were both happy..when we were going to see each other..you left me.. you mom has no room to be involved when she has no fucking clue what you did to me.. and you act like your the hurt one. I cant stand how much you act like you didnt know you were hurting me..I cried and begged you so many times..and so many times you hung up on me. Why should I not hurt you.. you would never be the person I loved.. the one that actually cared about people.. I hate you so much for how much you didnt try..and you lied saying you did.. I give up on people... If your ""one of the better ones"" then I dont want to be around them.. they are going to just fuck with me as much as you did.. you did it on purpose..I dont care how much you lie about it.. you knew exactly what you were doing. I tried to fix thigns and see you..talk thigns out..be there for you..give you time..I tried everything...and you gave me nothing in return. If your mom knew what you did to me.. you should understand why it hurts me so much...if she saw the way you treated me.. I was so wonderful to you and you just tried me like shit.. I just want someone to kill me.. I know I cant...Im not strong enough..."

"event","Well.. 3 people wanted to do stuff with me today..  2 canceled kinda.. and the 3rd was too late cuz I was going to hang with the others.. I'm just not going to hang out anymore.. gets my hopes up that I might have a good night..but It never seems to really happen. Such as last night, thought I was going to have one spend the night.. but that got kinda ruined.. Im just really stressed out for some reason.. and hating so much in my life. I just want to give up.. I dont want to try and be happy anymore.. it always gets ruined. I'm never going to see the girl I love again..because she doesnt exsist.. she has changed too much to even be called the girl I first started loving.. I just dont know what to do even... DDR is boring now..ITG makes me remember Hollie..and It is all the way over at narrows. I never have anything to look forward to when I get home...or for the weekend. I use to love knowing friday was coming... so then I could cuddle and see the girl I love and just have a great time. I know I can't say Im not going to be friends with anyone..I want to.. just feel like it is going to be a big let down. I feel sick right now.. I think I need to find new people to hang out with, but the problem is..I dont really like getting to know new people.. it is just that much more to worry about, wondering if it is going to turn to shit. Like my relationships... they were wonderful..but somehow I seemed to know how to mess those up. Lose the girl I love 2 times... gave up a really good friend.. and end up with not much then alot of feeling like Im going to be sick all the time... I really can't wait till I start meds... I really hope it changes me.. I dont care if Im the same person, as long as I dont feel like shit all the time anymore. I still haven't been eating alot.. I feel sick if I do eat much.. and I feel like no matter the amount of sleep I get..still so tired...  I really cant wait till I can hold someone again...I feel like crying but I dont want to cry ever again.. Ive done it enough.."

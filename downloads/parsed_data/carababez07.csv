"event","I stole some pictures from Rob from Valentines Day at Disney and some other random times at his house, and some from Fridays (which I may have posted already but I'm not sure). I can't post ALL of the pictures from his house... too scandalous! =) And I don't know if some of the other parties involved want them shown to everyone. I also uploaded some other random pictures I had onto weblog, so I'll post those too.

"event","Only You

Before you I had a heart of stone
And before you
I never let anyone get close
But you broke down those walls
One kiss from you
Baby that was all
And I knew by the way I felt
I would never love anyone else
Oh, it's true

Only you
Oh, only you
Oh, only you
oh, only you

Life was hard
Full of unrequited love
And breaking hearts
Seemed all I was capable of
And I feared that I
Would never be tamed
I didn't know my life
Was about to change
How many have loved me this way
But made me feel the same
Oh, it's true

Only you
Oh, only you
Oh, only you
Oh, only you

I knew it from the start
You completely stole my heart
Oh, it's true

<b>Goodbye Cry</b>

Sometimes you cry when you're alone
And sometimes you cry because you miss being home
There's so many reasons to shed a tear
But there ain't nothing worse
Then this one right here

It's a goodbye cry
You can't see your face
Through the tears in your eyes
It's a goodbye cry
You don't know when
You're gonna see her again
Here comes another goodbye cry

It's getting late
And she knows
It's time to leave
But she's not letting go
She squeezes as tight as she can
And that's when you feel it
Starting over again

It's a goodbye cry
The kind that hits you
When she's just out of sight
It's a goodbye cry
You try to be tough
But tough ain't enough
Against a goodbye cry

Oh, I don't want you to go
Even though we know
Baby we both know

I'm gonna have to say
Bye, baby, bye
I'll see you again
It's just a matter of time
I said bye, baby, bye
A kiss on the cheek
My heart skips a beat
Oh lord, here comes another goodbye cry
--------------------------------------------
<b>Can't Stop Thinking About You</b>

Last night I knew I needed
To get some sleep
At about 3 am,
I knew it wasn't happening
Can't get any shut eye
Baby, what am I supposed to do
I'm slowly losing my health
Look at what you put me through

I can't stop thinkin about you
Oh, I can't stop dreamin about you
And I wish that you
Would give it another chance
I tried but I just can't
Stop thinkin about you

Too many thoughts keep on running
Through my head
I'm starting to wonder why
I even got in bed
You memory has been
Just too hard to shake
I know you're gone
But baby, you just won't go away

I can't stop thinkin about you
Oh, I can't stop dreamin about you
And I wish that you
Would give it another chance
I tried but I just can't
Stop thinkin about you</lj-cut>"

I got a prom dress guys. It's cute. I got really bored, and I was tired of having to describe it to everyone... so I found a dress that's similar to it and then altered it on paint to make it look a little more like my dress. =)

So it basically looks like that minus the frilly stuff at the bottom. And that's a bow on the neck thing if you couldn't tell. It's cute, and I'm excited.

I also got a little black purse with a black bow on it, and then my mom and I are going to go to the store to look for the same pink ribbon to put on the purse instead of the black bow. I also got some hot shoes that match SO good. I found them and they were $60 and I was like I can deal with that... but then we got to the register and they were majorly on sale and ended up costing $20! So that's very cool. I'm getting really excited now. Limos are fun! =)

"event","I hate to have 3 entries in one day... but my dad just told me the weirdest story. It gave me the chills. So I figured I would share. It's funny how certain things happen in life.

<lj-cut text=Those.odd.things.in.life>
Just a little background before I get into this story. So my dad's side of the family isn't really that close. My grandfather passed away when my brother was one or something, so I never met him. My grandmother lives in New York and we don't get to see her that often. My dad has 3 brothers (Alan, Brian and David), but Alan passed away long before I was born. My Uncle Brian lives in Longwood, but we don't talk to him that much for a lot of reasons. My Uncle David lives in North Carolina, and we probably see/talk to him the most. Ok, that's the basics.

My grammie just had surgery today (which I could get into a whole other story, because I found out today that I have a very high risk of developing ovarian cancer when I'm older. But we won't go there). So my Uncle Dave and Uncle Brian are up in New York right now making sure she's okay and all of that. I guess they talked to my dad earlier today and told him about how they had been talking about when my grandfather passed away. My Uncle Brian was living in Sarasota at the time, and my grandfather had flown down to see him. So my uncle picked him up at the airport, and they were somewhere where there was a piano. So my grandfather played a song (no one even knew he knew how to play piano except my grammie), which was his favorite song, he closed the piano, and then had a massive stroke and died right there with my Uncle. I never knew any of this. So I guess they told my grammie about that and she was like ""yeah, that was his favorite song, he played it all the time."" So my uncles went to the music store today to buy a tape of that song to give it to my grammie because she likes it too. What song was it you may be wondering? It turns out that it was Claire de Lune by Claude Debussy. No one probably knows, but I like to listen to classical music sometimes... and Claire de Lune is by far my favorite classical piece. My dad knew that I love it because we went out to dinner with my grandparents at the Portofino Bay Hotel a little while back (I wrote a post about it, maybe I'll look for it a little later) and the pianist in the lobby was playing it and I made a big deal about it. I don't know, it's just a really weird coincidence. I guess it's just that Menzies in me. I never met my grandfather, and I really wish I would have gotten the chance, but now I really feel like I can have something to connect me to him. I don't know, this just really was meaningful to me.</lj-cut>"

"event","Gah... everyone stop it! Just forget about everything. We're all <b>friends</b>. Things shouldn't be like this. Just stop. Enough drama. We all realize that some lines may have been crossed, and some feelings may have been hurt... but it's getting old.

Dylan - I know you are probably not appreciated as much as you should be. You're always the one that everyone goes to with their problems... and I know it's probably annoying as hell. But you don't even realize how much you've helped me, and I'm sure the same goes for everyone else. You can take time from yourself... but don't completely seclude yourself from everyone. It's just making things more tense. You can still be with yourself without being completely by yourself. Don't talk about your problems through lj... let people know in person.

Lynzie - I know that you really care about Jan... but I think we <b>all</b> let things go a little too far. I know she appreciates us sticking up for her, but I don't think things would have gotten as bad if we hadn't all said everything that we did. It's not just you... she wants us all to just let it go.

Marnie - Not really sure what problem you have with it, but we all need to stop being retarded.

Jan - I can see where everyone is coming from with this situation. We were all there for you non-stop, always listening to your problems, talking to you on the phone when you called us up crying, sticking up for you... but then when we try to help with things you get all defensive like our opinions don't matter. Things did go too far and a lot of what was said shouldn't have been. I think we're just all burnt out from giving advice and telling you how we feel because this has dragged on for so long. I know sometimes I feel a little like my advice didn't matter to you because you still went against everything I said, so I'm thinking that everyone else might feel the same. If you stop talking about it, maybe everyone else will too.

Anyone else - same goes for you.

Seriously, it's getting ridiculous. Stop talking about it in your live journals... stop talking about it at school... just STOP talking about it all together. We need to all take our pride, throw it out the window and stop being dumb. This goes for me as well. Just stop talking about it and I think everything will be fine. This is the last time I'm saying anything about this. We have 108 days to make the <b>most</b> of our time together. Just think about that..."

- I can't see out of my right eye very good at the moment. It's <b>weird</b> and I can't figure out why.
- I took a rather long nap today. <b>Refreshing.</b> It probably would have been longer... but people kept calling me and waking me up.
- I just found out that <b>Armor for Sleep</b> is coming to the Social on the 12th... Britt, Andi, Ann... we are SO going, yes? Next Thursday. (<a href=""http://www.orlandosocial.com/calendar/index.cfm?date=%7Bts%20%272004%2D02%2D12%2000%3A00%3A00%27%7D&next=0&more=0&all=0"">Oh Yeah!</a>)
- <b>FSU this weekend!!</b> Leaving Friday, driving Paige back up with us (us being Jan and I). Ah, I'm excited. Yes, we're <b>actually</b> going this time. No more saying that we're going to, and then not... because we're definitely doing it! Paige, Matt... you better show us a good time! =) <b>Edit:</b> Matt is going to be out of town. Sad. =(
- Jan and I actuallly went to <b>1st period</b> today. Crazy, huh? We decided to go in to Mr. Handley's and make some cool stuff. I didn't finish my little candle holder because I'm slow.
- So far I'm doing good on this going to school this whole week thing (unless you count 1st period... which I don't!)
- I somehow managed to BS my way through my outline for English... which means hopefully I won't fail this semester.
- Everytime I wear my <b>Flagler</b> sweatshirt to school (like today), people always ask me if I'm going there. I then get to proudly smile and say yes. I get more and more excited every day.
- I took the most impossible Family Law test today. It sucked... a lot, and I'm more than positive that I <b>failed.</b> Even the smartest people in that class thought it was horrible. Oh great.
- I decided not to bake cookies today because I didn't want to do it by myself again. So instead I went to McDonalds with Andy and all of those <b>crazy kids.</b>
- I went with Kyle to the store today to help him pick out flowers to give to Brittany. So cute. They had <b>tulips</b>... and they made me happy. They also had these gorgeous bright pinkish-purplish roses, but they only had those in a vase, so he didn't get them. The light pink were still a very good choice.
- Dylan was <b>MIA</b> today. That made me sad because I missed my Dylan hug. =(
- Now since we're leaving Friday... I can't go to <b>Rob's</b> Friday night. Now I'm sad. =( Sorry hun.
- I think I'm obsessed with this song. <b>Beautiful.</b>
- Jan is 99% definitely coming with us to <b>Italy!!</b> (some stuff with the flights still needs to get worked out) Holy crap, I'm so excited. I was excited before, but now that she's coming... it's like excitement in double time!
<b>- I don't think I can complain about anything in my life right now. Everything is going good... and I'm completely happy.</b> I love all of my friends."

"event","So one good thing did happen today... I managed to sign out and go to Best Buy to get the new Incubus CD (as promised). So here is where I become a nerd (but what's new?) and analyze the CD...

<lj-cut text=A.Crow.Left.of.the.Murder>
<b>1. Megalomaniac:</b> I'm sure everyone has heard this on the radio or MTV by now. I enjoy this song. I think it's kind of generic Incubus rock... but I guess that's what they're known for best. This song may have fit somewhere between Make Yourself and Morning View. Still don't know what Megalomaniac means, but maybe I'll figure it out one of these days. <i>""If I were your appendages, I'd hold open your eyes so you'd see that all of us were heaven sent.""</i>
<b>2. A Crow Left of the Murder:</b> Hmm. Maybe not one of my favorites on the CD, but it's kind of interesting how it switches from mellow to rock a lot throughout. Still not a bad track. I don't think it really fits into any of their other CD styles... so good for originallity? I do like the little intro guitar riff though. <i>""Even straight roads meander""</i>
<b>3. Agoraphobia:</b> Different sound. I like it though. I like how Brandon's voice sounds on this song a lot. Pretty good track. <i>""Know that fate is what we make of it""</i>
<b>4. Talk Shows on Mute:</b> I like this one. Kind of that more relaxed, chill out feel. Lyrically... interesting? Less turntable effects on this one... more natural, I guess. <i>""You foundation is canyoning, fault lines should be worn with pride.""</i>
<b>5. Beware! Criminal:</b> Lyrically... VERY good. I actually like this song a lot. Overall very good musically. Interesting distortion going on. Simple as that. <i>""A butterfly under the glass; you are beautiful but you're not going anywhere.""</i>
<b>6. Sick, Sad, Little World:</b> Very interesting guitar... I like. I think this is very different than any of their songs before. The bridge sounds really cool and different. Experimenting with many different types of distortion. Longest song on the CD I think. Pretty neat song. <i>""The world is a joke when out of love.""</i>
<b>7. Pistola:</b> Cool lyrics. One of my favorites on the CD, I believe. Lots of interesting things going on in this one (sound effects, crazy guitar stuff, etc). Switches up with many different sounds throughout. Very interesting. <i>""My intention: a bullet; My body: a trigger finger!""</i>
<b>8. Southern Girl:</b> Ah, being a sucker for pretty lyrics and Brandon Boyd's voice... I REALLY like this song. asdl;kfj. Yeah, I like it. Lots. That's all I have to say about that. =) <i>""If you're looking for an open book, look no further, I am yours.""</i>
<b>9. Priceless:</b> Here we get back to S.C.I.E.N.C.E. some. Which is cool because I like older Incubus. Very very cool jazzy breakdown. Which I like a lot. Good song overall. Definitely very much like older Incubus. <i>""I wish that you could get a glimpse, I wish that you could see because the look on your face was priceless.""</i>
<b>10. Zee Deveel:</b> This song is different. But it's cool, I like it. Cool drums going on. Pretty crazy, but neat. <i>""You should be careful what you wish for! 'Cause everyone of us has the devil inside.""</i>
<b>11. Made for TV Movie:</b> Probably not one of my favorites. Nothing really stands out to me with this one. It's just okay I guess. Eh?
<b>12. Smile Lines:</b> I like these lyrics. Nothing specially stands out musically, but it's still a good song. <i>""So, insecurities... are about as useful as trying to put the pin back in the grenade.""</i>
<b>13. Here in My Room:</b> Digging the piano. Very different from any of their other songs I think. I like it though... ya know, being a sucker for those slow songs. =) Good lyrics here too. Good vocals. <i>""If the world were to fall apart in a fiction-worthy wind, I wouldn't change a thing now that you're here."" ""Now show me the world as seen from the stars""</i>
<b>14. Leech:</b> Fits somewhere between S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself. Pretty interesting. I sense some anger in the lyrics? heh. Good song, but not one of my favorites. <i>""Yes, men too, can be on the rag.""</i>
</lj-cut>

So there ya go, I'm a dork. heh. Very good CD overall. Once again, didn't let me down. =) So everyone should go out and buy it... RIGHT NOW!"

So apparently today is supposed to be National Friendship Day or something like that. Kind of ironic... because today seemed like everything but. I don't know what's been going on lately. High school is turning us all into monsters. AH, the tension. It's driving me nuts. You could cut it with a knife. We all need a LONG vacation... or we just need to have a bitch session where everyone can get what they're thinking out in the open. Something tells me that would be a very bad idea, though. Spring Break is much too far away. Today was just another one of those ""ehh"" days for me. I felt like I was kind of unneccessarily rude to everyone today. Maybe it's from lack of sleep... but I don't know, I don't think I was really myself. It was just one of those days where everything and everyone was getting on my nerves (and no, it's not that time of the month). On top of all of that, the administrators were being dicks today. I hope they don't act like this the rest of the year. Overall evaluation of senior year thus far... fucking sucks. 109 days. Blah. I just really don't know anymore.

"event","Tomorrow should be a national holiday. =) NEW INCUBUS CD COMES OUT! I'm most definitely leaving during lunch (since I don't have a 5th period tomorrow) and heading out to Best Buy to get a copy. I've been listening to the CD on MTV leak... and I'm really digging it <b>a lot</b>. All of their different album styles combined, but also with a new sound. I don't know where to place it... but I really like it. That's why I think they are so incredible... their ability to reinvent themselves and pull off so many different styles of music... they're not afraid to experiment with new ideas, new instruments, all that good stuff. I'm just always impressed by them. Yeah, so Incubus still stands as my favorite band of all time, and this CD is definitely not a dissapointment AT ALL. Now I have to go to bed... so I'll update with more later."

"event","Haven't updated in a few days. Hmm. Wednesday, most likely nothing interesting because I can't remember. Thursday, Brave Aid XIX (yes, that's a 19. lol). It was nothing spectacular. Sound system sucked (what's new?). Rob is like in love with the Bravettes. haha. Stix was better last year, I could have gone without the guitars. Now for some rambling...

So once again... being grounded over the weekend has proven to be something productive. I made 2, count em, <big><b>2</big></b> live journals! One for Lynzie (<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/jo_bug/"">jo_bug</a>) and one for Marnie (<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/mar_mar_04/"">mar_mar_04</a>). That is because I am awesome. Lynzie likes the beach and pink, Marnie likes Nemo... so things worked out. 

I guess my parents aren't very good at this whole grounding thing because they let me go to girls night at Jan's and also let me spend the night. Fun times to say the least. I don't even know how many times I've seen <i>Varsity Blues</i> and <i>Finding Nemo</i> now. Jan and I got in a ""fight"". Then she thought she would be all cool and call Rob on me to tell him that I was being mean... like he's going to do something about it? =) She threw something at me and it hit me in the head. Meany. I was kind of tired all night so I probably wasn't much fun, but what can you do? Brittany pulled a Cara on us and didn't show back up until like 2, after not answering her phone for a million years. It didn't phase me much though because I fell asleep. lol. 7 people in a queen size bed? Not a good idea. Dylan brought Jan and I slurpees! mmm.

Jan and I had a good conversation last night. About college and all of that good stuff. I think I'm pretty ready for it. I dunno. I'm excited that she decided on UNF. She'll only be 30 minutes away from me. Close enough... but still far enough. hehe. I will definitely be spending some CRAZY weekends in Jacksonville. Now I found out Mike (not English) will be living in a house with Drew, Chris and Justin (and Zach??) in J-Ville, and he said I could come stay with them too... so definite crazy times.

Eee! Rob is coming to see me... RIGHT NOW! I missed him SO much last night. I don't know what it was... but I was just like wow, I really wish he was here. ... He just left. hehe. He and Ryan were on the way to Citgo (yes, I introduced both of them to the wonderful world of the Curry Ford Citgo and their lack of IDing), so they stopped by here real quick. Rob ran at me like he hasn't seen me in a year or something and gave me a HUGE hug... too bad it's only been like 2 days. Nerd. lol. We stood in the middle of the road in the rain. Aw how cute. Hopefully I'll be allowed to go to Marnie's tomorrow and he can get a ride over there so I can see him again! He gets his stitches out tomorrow too... so I won't have to look at his yucky chin. lol. How did we both spend our Saturday nights? Talking on the phone while I read some of his lj entries from way back in the day out loud to him. He has some... interesting (for lack of a better word) stories. He's gone through WAY more than I will probably <b>ever</b> experience in my lifetime. But that's what keeps me intrigued... wanting to know more. I'm hooked. And I'm happy. I played my guitarra for him. I guess he was impressed, but I still think I suck. But actually, I think I've gotten a lot better recently. Sugar cookie! =)

The Mad Caddies are awesome. Too bad the Pennywise/Mad Caddies show sold out, because it would have been very cool. Anyways... I'm pretty beat, so I'll probably be heading to bed soon. So go do something productive... like DL some Mad Caddies."

Go to school, <b>every</b> class, the <b>whole</b> week. Not even skipping 1st period (even though there's really no point of going). You guys don't even know how hard of a task this will be for me... but I'm gonna try real hard! Blah. Who am I kidding? It probably won't happen. lol. I guess I'll try though. I can't make any promises about 1st!

I think Martin on 7th Heaven is way hot. lol. I'm such a nerd, I've been watching this show for years. (yes, big dork. I know) I used to think Simon was hot... but Martin is WAY better. Ok, I need to shut up now.

I found this on Rob's live journal, so I stole it because I think it's nice:
<lj-cut text=Clickity.Click>
somewhere between the procrastination, and the homework, and the friendships, and the calls to each other complaining. somewhere between the phone calls to old friends, and the ""i miss yous"" the ""i love yous"" and the ""what are we doing tonites?"". somewhere between all of the changing and growing...somewhere between the classes, skipping classes, and tests...i forgot. i forgot what it was all about. somewhere between the appointments, paying and not paying bills, making & breaking plans, appearing, disappearing, then reappearing, i forgot. i forgot what its like to cry, that pretending to be happy doesnt make you happy, pretending to be smart doesn't make you smart. i forgot that you cant just forget the past in fear of the future. i forgot that you cant control falling in love, and you cant make yourself fall in love...and thats its ok to mess up, and ask for help, and feel like shit. ive learned that its ok to complain and whine to your friends for a whole day, and sometimes the things that you want most you just cant have. ive learned that the greatest thing about highschool isnt the partying and the drinking or the hook ups. its the friendships, which means taking chances. ive learned that the things that we sometimes want to forget are the things that need to be talked about. ive learned that time can heal things, and just when you think it cant get any worse- it does. but with your friends, you survive. ive learned that when you start feeling bad about losing touch, those that youve lost touch with feel the same way. but basically, ive learned that friends, both old and new, are the most important people in the world, and without them i wouldnt be who i am today. so this is a thank you, to all of my friends, old and new, in touch and lost touch...thank you for teaching me what highschool and friendships are all about. </lj-cut>
I guess it pretty much sums up everything I've been thinking about."

"event","Everytime I listen to this song... just wow. I love it. (Jan, go DL it) It makes me think about how I want my last night with all of my friends, before heading to college, to be. Kind of bittersweet, but still amazing. Just randomly hanging out somewhere, not acting like so-called ""adults"", being stupid, laughing, crying, taking pictures, not wanting the night to end. I hope it's not a letdown when it actually happens. I have this huge idea built up in my head, and watch it be some lame night with nothing interesting going on. But my friends are awesome, so I imagine this night will be something special. It's like those nights laying on the beach, freezing cold, wind blowing my hair, staring at the stars, just as a shooting star goes by. Those nights driving around without a destination, with the windows down, listening to my favorite mix CD. The kind of nights you live for. At least, the kind <b>I</b> live for. Call me cheesy... but little things like that excite me. As much as I always say I want to graduate so bad (don't get me wrong, I still definitely do. 119 days, something like that)... there are really times where I'm going to miss being in high school. Probably not high school, but just being with my friends. I hate living in Orlando and want to get out, but I'm really going to miss the stupid things that provided some sort of entertainment. Driving down I-drive honking and yelling at tourists, little drives downtown on busy Friday nights, annoying everyone at the restaurants when we go out to eat (got 'em!), stealing christmas trees, silly-stringing random cars, getting chased by said car owners, Pointe Orlando, Festival Bay, bowling, mini golf (including the glow-in-the-dark kind!), getting hit on by either nasty old guys or 14 year olds (how old? he'll be 15 in a few weeks?), going to tons of 7-11s to find freaking Dr. Pepper slurpees, anything crazy having to do with Narcossee (Publix field trips, parties, cops), driving on I-4 to see what downtown looks like lit up at night, the strange smells while driving on I-4, Cowboys, movie nights (even though the movies ALWAYS get interupted), concerts, nights spent sitting around doing nothing except saying ""what do you want to do?"" ""I don't know, what do <i>you</i> want to do?"", going to the mall and spending money I don't have, go carting, unsuccessfully looking for hot guys to pick up, porn hunting, Wendys, just being bored and stupid in general. Sorry to bore everyone with my corny little ""growing up"" posts... but when I get bored (like I am right now) I really get to thinking about a lot, and I like to write it down.

That'll cost me a good, about $90.00. Oh yay. According to Andi... SoCo and Yellowcard are coming in March. How freaking awesome would that be? Oh, and who wants to drive to either J-Ville, Tampa or West Palm with me to see John Mayer? (J-Ville may work out the best) Know what I was just thinking about... when I go off to college, I won't get to go to as many shows. That's sad. Because I doubt anyone goes to St. Augustine. I'll probably have to drive up to J-Ville (or come back here) a lot. There's this place there called Jack Rabbits that I imagine is very similar to the Social, so I'll have to check that one out. But I won't have House of Blues or Hard Rock Live, and that's sad.

Jan might go to Flagler! She applied today. That would be so cool. Pure craziness, I would imagine. Me and Jan rooming together... scary thought! If she decides to go to UNF instead, I guess I would be okay with that because it's only about 30 minutes away, and I'll have somewhere to crash when I drive up to go to concerts. She can be my little concert buddy. =) Speaking of Jan, I just remembered I was supposed to call her back, so that's what I'm off to do..."

We had to go let Lynzie's mom meet Rob so that Lynzie would be allowed to go over to his place. That was a scary thought in my mind. Jan and I stayed in the car... but apparently it went pretty well. He said that she was glad he wasn't some crazy stalker, and told him he has a nice smile and that he and I would definitely make a cute couple. Aw. lol.

I think all of this lack of sleep is just starting to pile up, and I'm eventually just going to have a physical breakdown and sleep for a very long time. I almost fell asleep in all of my classes today, even while I was taking my tests in Marine Science and Economics.

We've had our ups and downs... but even though there have been times I've thought things can't get any worse... I always know that we can find a way to work things out and that our friendship will only get stronger because of it. We've experienced SO much together. All the trials & tribulations of high school, her corruption process (hah, I'm responsible for that one! errr), bullshit, drama, shit talking... but also the good things like middle of the night beach trips, spring break, movie nights, slurpee runs, trips down I-drive, parties, and so much more. I can't think of any other person in the world that I would rather do all of this with. 

There is nothing I hate more than if someone hurts my best friend. I don't understand how anyone could even begin to fathom such an idea as to treat such an exceptional person like shit. You know who I'm talking about. He has NO right to treat her like that. He knows that, for some reason unknown to me, she cares about him so much. He knows that he can walk all over her and that she'll just keep coming back to him. He knows that he can toy with her emotions, and manipulate her mind into thinking that he actually cares (even though he really doesn't) so he can get what he wants from her. What kind of person goes out with a girl, says he loves her, cheats on her, lies about it, still says he loves her, breaks up with her, goes out with the first girlfriend's <b>best friend</b>, says he loves <i>her</i> after a few weeks, tells people he can't stand to be with her for long periods of time, cheats on her more than once, breaks up with her, goes back out with her, cheats on her <i><b>at least</b></i> 2 more times and still says that he loves her? I don't think I can think of a word mean enough that I would like to use to describe this person. I like to think that I'm a pretty good judge of character. I'm usually not one to put you down for something you do, and I'm not one to tell people what to do because I believe everyone is capable of making their own decisions... but if there is EVER a time that I am going to judge ONE person, and I so strongly discourage you to hang out with them... this is that time. Jan, you do not deserve <b>ANY</b> of this from him. You are SO much better than him. You are SO much better than he makes you think you are. Who is he to say that no one will ever love you? Just because he made the worst decision of his life to pass up a chance with you, does NOT mean that he has the right to say that you... or ANYONE for that matter. One day you WILL find that one person that loves you more than life itself... and when that happens I'm sure you will be completely blown away. Jan, you're only 17... you have SO much more time to find that. Don't let <big><b>ANYONE</big></b> tell you otherwise. Don't rush it. Jan, just PLEASE don't let anyone get to you. You have so much going for you and you are an awesome person. I love you!"

"event","So here I am... still grounded. =( I guess I'll just have to mooch rides to and from school off of my friends still. I don't think I would be as grounded if a certain <i>""adult""</i> wouldn't have decided to stick their nose where it doesn't belong and told my mom anything. Actually, I don't think... I KNOW. What was the point? Honestly. What kind of ""grown up"" starts more drama than most high schoolers? We're better than you anyway, mind your own business. If I end up anything like you in the future, I really don't know what I would do. Probably something not very good. Whatever... you go ahead and have the satisfaction of <b>thinking</b> that you did something good and that we're the bad ones here... but I know otherwise, and I'll just sit here and know that would rather be grounded for the rest of my life than to be anything like you. Jealousy can make an ass out of <b>you</b>. </vent>

But this whole being grounded thing has proved something pretty good to me... I have a kick ass best friend. =) Jan, thanks for taking time to come bum around my house with me. (and bring me coffee and chinese!) You've saved my sanity. I also cleaned my WHOLE room. So I guess I feel somewhat accomplished. Who would ever think one person could collect so much crap in a period of 7 years? I guess it was about time I cleaned everything up. So I picked a lovely weekend to screw up, but I guess it wasn't all THAT bad. Now tomorrow we're back to hell. I would rather be grounded then have to go to school. Ew."

I'll be really sad. And then I'll probably end up lieing to them more and that would be bad.

We ate at Johnny Rockets and made friends with every waiter in there. Ev is loud. Then we went and shopped... again. haha. I tried on this hot skirt in Abercrombie. Too bad it was REALLY short. It still looked hot though. I didn't buy anything, even though I have $175 in gift certificates to there. We saw Peter Pan. If I was a 13 year old girl... I would so want him.

Lots going on since I last left you. So St. Augustine was fun. Besides the fact that my parents were pissing me off a lot by being the most impatient people ever and thinking that they have a lot of money and had that 'holier than thou' attitude. I had fun hanging out with my brother though. It took almost 3 hours to get home because people think it's neat to slow down and stare at the car that's broken down. Not even an accident, just one car sitting there. I want to go back and just sit there on the beach. You may think St. Augustine is boring, but I love it. It will have to do until I can make it to Cali. Then later I headed to the Social to see Spitvalves and the Supervillains (and others). The Supervillains are so great. I'm sad Andi couldn't be there with me to experience them. =( But we'll go the 29th (I looked it up!) 5 hours of standing was getting a little annoying though. Today Ann came with me and I got a HOT haircut. I like it a lot. I didn't have enough money to get some hot red highlights... but maybe another time. Then we went to Ann's to eat Wendys and watch most of Supertroopers. CANDY BARS! The snozberries taste like snozberries. ""If I had guy hair, it would so want to fuck your hair"" Then I almost forgot I had guitar lessons (again), but my mom reminded me so I went there and played me some Brand New. After that I headed out to Fridays to meet Britt, Andi, Dylan, Marnie, Jan, Lynzie and Steve for some dinner (even though I didn't eat because I'm poor). That was so much fun. Rob is a kick ass waiter. =) They told the balloon guy that it was my birthday, so he made me a purple monkey. And Britt is a genius. heh. (Yes, make you look like an idiot in front of the hot guy. haha)

And now I sit here at 12:17 am because I'm not tired, but I should be in bed because we have to go back to school tomorrow. I'm really not looking foward to it... at all. There's really no point of going anymore. I already got in to college, so I'm good. Right? 

Things to look foward to (as of 1/6/04):
DC trip - 2 months and 1 day
Spring Break - 2 months and 7 days (the week where I'm allowed to break New Years resolution #4... even though I'll probably break it long before that)
Graduation - 4 months and 15 days
Italy - 4 months and 17 days (you guys don't even know how excited I am. I get to hang out with my natives. haha)
I'm legal (and the day I'm going to a strip club!) - 6 months and 1 day (who ever said being illegal stopped me before anyway? =) )
College - about 8 months (and that's too far away)

"event","I've been talking to one of my friends about a lot in the past few minutes. They're not someone who I usually go to for advice or talk about my problems with, but the things they've told me make so much sense to me. It's made me realize a lot. I've realized that I am not going to sacrifice my happiness anymore for anyone. It just seems like sometimes when someone else is unhappy, I feel bad for being happy around them. That shouldn't happen. Let me be happy, damnit! Looking back on some of the little fights I've had with people, it always seems to me that I'm the one to blame for everything. I've realized that I'm really not. I'm not going to let anyone make me feel like that anymore. This is the second half of senior year... I need to just enjoy myself. I need to relax (or relaz, as Kyle would say. hah) I need to get rid of the unecessary. Quoting Kyle: ""You will feel better about yourself and sometimes thats all that matters."" That is so true. I've always thought that, but then I always feel so selfish when I do... but hearing it from someone else just makes me realize that it's okay. I am going to do things that make <b>ME</b> feel good. So this is what I'm going to do from now on. I'm not going to work hard to make things work out with anyone. I don't think you should have to work with good, strong friendships. They should come naturally. I'm just going to sit back and let things come to me. I am going to ENJOY myself. I'm going to hang out with people like Andy and that whole crazy group more often. Because recently I've never laughed so much or felt so much of myself except for with them. I think guys are so much easier to hang out with, they don't give a shit. At the risk of sounding selfish... the second half of my senior year is <b>ALL ABOUT ME.</b>

So I've realized that online journals are evil. Yeah they can be cool sometimes... but then there's the other times when things are said, people read them and end up getting really pissed off. I don't know if anyone ever gets offended by my journal (because I think I censor myself a lot)... but I'm just going to stay on the safe side and take it easy on here. I guess don't consider this my farewell post... because I'll probably write something from time to time. I'm just not going to spend my time on here writing meaningless crap that no one cares about. I could sit here and write something ""meaningful"" and thank people for being so great and then leave someone out... but all that would do it make people mad and feel like they're worthless in that person's eyes. I guess maybe I'm bitter, but I don't need online journals right now.

So until next time... go listen to some Something Corporate!"

"event","Hope everyone had a happy and safe New Years! My night was... enlightening, I guess. I think I learned a lot about how I want 2004 to go. 2003 was an... interesting year, to say the least. A freaking emotional rollercoaster. I could get in to detail and write all of this meaningful stuff, but I'm kind of tired and not in the mood. Lots of great memories (and maybe some not so great ones too). Once again, I could get into those, but we'll save that for another time.
So here they are...

Cara's New Years resolutions:
1. Get a job
2. Tone down the senioritis (doubt that will happen)
3. Get better at guitar
4. Stop drinking
5. Start working out and get some abs!

I had some other ones... but I decided to get rid of them, because I think resolutions should be things to improve yourself... not just doing them to please other people. Just a few minutes ago my top 2 were <i>Try to be less selfish</i> and <i>Try to be a better friend to everyone</i>, but I don't want those as my top 2. People should like me or dislike me for who I am... and I'm not going to change that now. I'm in such a blah mood right now. I've thought about a lot lately, and I thought I had things figured out... but I messed up somewhere along the way. I don't know. I've been beating myself up over thinking I'm a bad person all day... but I don't think I should be. I don't think I want to change myself for anyone. As pissed off as people may get at me, right now I don't even care. I hate to say that, but I'm done being fake. Ultimately my life is just about myself. That probably sounds really selfish, but it's the truth. I'm here to live my life and do the things I want with it... and hope that I'll make something of myself. So make what you want out of that, because <b>you're just getting me - uncensored, straight foward, no sugar-coating, real - from now on.</b>

I'm going to St. Augustine tomorrow so my dad and brother can see Flagler. I have a feeling that being there again is just going to make my want to graduate and leave go in to overdrive. 4 months and 20 days... too far away if you ask me.

""A long December and there's reason to believe 
Maybe this year will be better than the last"""

"event","I changed my brother's (<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ghettogumby/"">ghettogumby</a>) layout because I'm nice like that. It's okay I suppose. Nothing special. (I used most of the same codes that I used on my layout. haha) But this is what happens when Cara gets bored.

My parents are going out of town in a few hours. So that means I can stay out as late as I want! =) Too bad I have nothing interesting to do tonight.

I got all of my Flagler shit mailed today. (paperwork and deposit) So yay, I'm going to college. My brother and I are driving up to St. Augustine on Friday to meet my parents up there, then we come home Sunday. I guess we're going so my brother and dad can check out the campus. I'm just ready for senior year to be over.

Sorry if I've seemed kind of rude this break. I've just been in the mood to just relax and spend time alone. I'm not sure why... but sometimes I just don't want to be bothered."

<s>Oh crap. Where the fuck did my background go? =(</s>
Do not fret... I fixed it. And now Brandon is here to stay. =)"

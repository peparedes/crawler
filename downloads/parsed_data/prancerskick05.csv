"event","ok fellow LJ nerds.... Yeah i know it's been a while... but i updated now so don't get ur panties in a knot.  OK well now i have a lot to talk about at least! So the DC trip was mucho fun aside from the fact that we got snowed in for 2 days... but it's ok snow is fun... oh ya then i came down with the flu.  So over all i missed 7 days of school... still not caught up... who cares all i care about is passing... i already got accepted to TX state YAY! (fyi: if you want to come stay at my dorm just holla) Prancer competition went well ... i guess... we got gold sweepstakes, super sweepstakes and all div. 1's... even though i still think my solo sucked hard core.  Lets see... Dillon and I just came up on our 3 month mark on V-day... which is kinda fun... UM if you hadn't noticed natalie has gone back to her natural color (black) and i have gone a lil darker as well... I had frozen custard for the first time on Wednesday... that's exciting.  I'm preparing (or lack of) for the musical... yeah i know i don't show up to practice but lets see... what's more important the musical... or dance... ya that's what i thought... who cares i only have like 5 lines... i'm the freaking house keeper, i'd rather be piece of dust under the priceless asian carpet #963... oh and an update on alexia's latest stupid remark: so we were at Razzoo's and they have their menu organized to where like rabbit food is salads and other random clever things... well she goes omg they serve rabbit here and brian and Dillon and i egged her on and we were like ya... duh... it's sooooo good and she was like eww and so the waiter come and she's like how's the rabbit here and he's like... the WHAT... and she's like it says you have rabbit and he's like... uh... no... that's rabbit food AKA salad... SOOOOO funny.... ok and as far as ADE goes we're learning a badass hip hop to california love and 1,2 step (so good but so over used) anyways this is getting really long and i probably forgot a whole lot so be looking for an update soon! I'll keep ya posted!

"event","I hate drama... I HATE it.  But anyways... Yesterday/Today was fun.  Alexia spent the night last night... and man did we party lol.  First We played a lil DDR then we ate dinner and then we made our famous guacamole and took some to Katie, Dillon, and James.  Our plan failed because James and Katie don't like guacamole and Dillon thinks its spicy... well it is.. kinda... but Alexia and I just inhale it because it's just TOO darn good.  So then we left and came back to my house and we watched Napoleon Dynamite (Heck yes!). So then we stayed up and talked and then went to bed at like 2:30. Then we woke up at 7:30 and took showers and got ready and then we went to Dillons and he was asleep at 9:00 when he said he'd be awake but whatever... we FINALLY at like 10:30 went to IHOP and had a lovely b-fast and then Alexia and I came back here and we looked at old prancer pix and I played her the sneak preview of the super secret prancer song HAHA and then she had to leave :( and since then I've just been layin around and talking to people online so ya... fun stuff! Well I'm gunna go be bored some more but ya'll leave me some comments or something.. Love ya!

"event","Sorry it's been so long since i've updated, but not much has really been goin on around here... lets see... I've been chillin with Katie a bunch which is totally awsome because I love her to death! So New years was fun and I definately stayed up till about 5:15 this morning... doing pretty much nothing lol but OMG we bought 16,000 fire crackers they were all connected and it was just this HUGE role omg... 100 feet long it took 30 minutes to light the whole thing and we actually ended up lighting both ends A) to make more noise and B) because it was taking forever.  We definately left a mess in the church parking lot off of becaves at cuernavaca... so if any of ya'll go to westlake bible church HAHA it's my mess... gotta love it... so loud and obnoxious I definately would have gotten the biggest littering fine ever... seriously if we woulda gotten caught. Well I'm tired I'm going back to bed... more to come later!"

"event","Ok so now i'm in a SUPER good mood.  I got a phone call from Dillon which totally made my day and then of course it's christmas eve so that's just fun in itself. We drove over to 37th street and saw the lights which by the way they are amazing! So now i'm going to bed because I'm super tired so if ya'll want to call me you can but i might not answer... just depends on how much of a good mood I'm in! so have a merry Christmahanukwanza, Happy easter, and whatever other religious holiday you might be celebrating!

"event","Sigh... it's going to be a lonely christmas... at least i have my mom and my sister and my grandmother here... it's so tragic though because Dillon is in Houston and I don't know when he'll be back, hopefully by monday or tuesday.  But never-the-less I miss him and even a nice phone conversation... no even an IM conversation would make my day.  To make matters worse, I'm on house arrest so basically I can't go anywhere without my sister or my mom.  But, I did get to see amanda about an hour ago and she definately spread the Christmas cheer! Well I'm off probably playing a game or building a puzzle, or something else just as boring!

Ok so today i went over to Katie's and we looked at dogs on her computer and then I ate linner (lunch/dinner) and went and picked up hannah.  Well this is the part where i get in trouble... my mom called right as i was leaving katie's and was like where have you been for the past 2 hours and i'm like... at katie's and she's like well you aren't suppose to be hanging out with your friends your grounded and i'm all like... ok whatever i'm picking up hannah... so she threatens to take my car away and now i'm at home in trouble... possibly without a car... so anways i'm probably going to get in more trouble tomorrow and the next day... but as Cambryn says ""It's our job to mess up"" that's how we learn from our mistakes so anyways i'm just going to have bundles of fun at home for the rest of the holiday!

Oh and one good thing did happen... i got the napoleon dynamite DVD SO excited... but for now ya'll call me and keep me from committing suicide for the next couple days while i have to be cooped up in my stupid house! AH! insanity!

"event","OK so you read my first entry... ya... bad day... well it got a lil better when I got to go shopping with my mom.  So we're on our way to Old Navy and we hear this really loud like pop sound and we're like UHH... but nothing else happened so we go into old navy.. fun fun whatever... then we come back out and like we're driving to Target and all of a sudden the car made a really loud squeal and then it starts like smoking really bad and it smelled like burning rubber... ew... and then we pull over into a jiffy lube and we're like ya... where's the nearest place we can get our car looked at and he goes... pop the hood.. so we did and he was like... ya... i think it's the radiator... we're like well we know you can't fix it so where can we go and he was like well good year does that so we pulled over to good year which was in the same parking lot we just didn't know they fixed problems like that.  So we go in and we're like well how long til you can look at it and the guy was like ... 20 minutes so we're like ok.. we're gunna go eat.  So me and my mom walked half a mile to fizoli's and ate dinner and then walked over to walmart and then the guy called and was like... ya... so basically your airconditioner blew up and caught on fire and my mom was like.. so can you fix it and he was like yeah i'll have it done by 5... it was 2:30 when he called... so we stay at walmart for another like... 2 hours and then decide to walk back... well we had to walk across the whole parking lot, down a hill, over a creek, up a hill, across a field, through a ditch, across the rest of the field, past the empty target, and finally make it back in one piece.  So finally he fixes our car and he's like ya that'll be 1100 bux merry xmas lol... so we had been watching CNN while he was fixin our car and this story comes on about this drug Celebrex, which is an arthritis/cancer drug that my grandmother is taking.  They were like this drug increases the risk of heart attack, high blood pressure... etc... the recommended dosage is like 100 mg a day and she's taking 800 becuase that's what's prescribed to her and she had been feeling really sick lately but we just thought it was from the chemo... so anyways then i went over to her house and had to fix her computer... wow i totally felt like a computer nerd... but anyways then we were on our way home and dillon calls and he was like all shaken up because these guys were on their way over to fight him ... still waiting for the results on that one... but anyways I just really hope tomorrow will be better but i have a feeling it's just going to get worse...

Katie! and grey and sam and some other people... but mostly katie.  So Katie came with us and then we went back to my car and drove over to dillon's house... who was asleep, but whatever..then we went and got a new dog for him.  Her name is missy and she's a 3 year old boxer who we adopted from the humane society. She is SOOOOO adorable! She is super hyperactive but she is so people friendly. SO we took her back to his apartment and then Brian (Dillon's roomate) and I went and got supplies for the new dog so she doesn't like starve herself to death.  Then we hung out for a lil while longer and Katie and I ordered a pizza and katie flirted with the pizza guy which was hilarious.  She of course ordered it for pick up so we picked it up and met the guy she was flirting with... how embarassing... and then went back to dillon's, ate the pizza, and then I took katie home... so we definately had an eventful day!"

"event","I'm sure everyone is just thrilled about the cast list... well a particular person on the cast list who shall not be named.  But, as for the rest of you, congrats! Personally, if i was casting it, I would definately put traci, callie, and sarah as the 3 main parts.  Unfortunately I didn't make the cast list so i can't really do anything about it.  I think there should be a certain relm of fairness about it though.  Like, for example, Seniors should get priority. All of the seniors are equally capable, or more capable to do any of the lead roles.  I'm not dissappointed with the part I got because i know prancers and dance take up too much time to have a lead role, but I am dissapointed with Mrs. Morris and Mrs.Kent's decision and I think everyone knows why.  If you are confused, just ask me but it's not that hard to figure out.  Well I'm going to quit griping and start getting ready for the day.  Maybe shopping will help out!  Oh, and if anyone wants to come to the Nutcracker tonight they are selling tickets at the door and it's our last performace and it's going to be really good.  So come watch, I'm a spanish dancer and a Rockette.  Yes, I know there aren't any Rockettes in the Nutcracker, but this is the Nutcracker Spectacular!  See ya'll tonight at 7:30 at the Westlake auditorium hehe.

"event","Yes, so once again I'm baking a cake.  This time it's a vanilla cake with chocolate frosting... MmMmMm...so anyways, baking makes me happy.  Why does it seem like the world is out to get me? I don't understand... even when i don't do anything wrong it seems like people still find a way to hate me for it.  But in other news... Musical auditions are over with! YES! Results are posted tomorrow at 3.  I want the part of Lily, but at this point I don't even care what i get because i'm going to be busy with dance anyways. Speaking of dance, Miz Ormesher is making us come in every day next week during finals and stay till 3... what a drag... anywho, i'm tierd so i'm going to go to bed now. Later ya'll"

"event","Hey ya'll yes... i'm now a LJ member too, but don't get me wrong i've been a long time reader.  I just don't know how i will ever be able to compare to some of ya'll... like Traci and Courtney...but i will try my best.  OK so today started out alright. I got to school and read a couple lines for the play, and went to detention after school.  I got a call from my mom saying that she had an emergency eye appointment because her retina is torn, which freaked me out because there was a possibility of her going blind in one eye. But she called back after her appointment and told me that they can repair it with laser surgery. Then, I went straight from school to Westlake FAF for dress rehearsal for the Nutcracker which lasted from 4:30 till 9:30.  Then on the way home, I stopped at McDonalds and drove home.  It took forever to get home because they are doing construction on Mopac.  So i'm stopped at a light and I got all excited because they gave my cookies in my Mighty Kids meal and I did my whole jazz hand in front of my face thing and i was like ""omg cookies!"" and the guy next to me... i'd say he was 40-50 yrs old, he honked and i look over and i was like ""Hannah, do we know him?"" and she goes ""just smile and wave"".  So I look over again and he MOCKED me!! He acted really homosexual and did the whole jazz hand in front of the face thing and mocked me.  I was so embarrassed, but it was so funny!  Anyways, I'll see all you Hyde Parkers early tomorrow mornin!"

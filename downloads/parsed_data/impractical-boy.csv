"event","I walked in between classes with Tina.  Tina had been kind enough to have her father fix my watch.  I suppose one might say that this obligates me, but I still enjoy her company anyway.  

Tina smokes but she's not supposed to.
""Ah my boyfriend would really let me have it if he knew I had bought a new pack of cigarretes.  He doesn't want me to smoke,"" she tells me. ""I have to make sure not to smoke an hour before I see him.  I don't want him to smell it.  I spray perfume over me so he can't tell.""
""Have you tried gum?"" I ask her.
""Oh yeah,"" she replied, ""Breath mints, perfume, everything.  Just to get rid of the smell.  But I can't really blame him for being so serious about it.  I mean, he's had cancer before.""
""What kind?""
""lukemia.""
""Oh.""

She stands there, with her slim cigs glowing.  I thought I could stand the smell, but it's worse than I thought it would be.  I think Ariane has quit smoking.  She used to smoke when she was teaching Writing 31.  I haven't seen her smoke since.  But Tina right then, much like me, we both just wanted to get through the day."

"event","I'm having a bit of trouble getting started this quarter.  With many things that is.  I have barely kept on time with the comic and my reading hasn't gotten to the point where it should be.  I didn't find the time to finish oliver twist, and I fear that I won't finish Villete.  I should have done more work yesterday.  But I wasted the majority of it on videogames and movies.  I was suppposed to write, but I couldn't really get started.  I guess I just need something to go on.
What I want to bring to our writing workshop, is a well worked story.  Not just something I produced in two hours time.  I think that doing this is of great importance.  I can't really say why.  Ah well,  I still have  Sunday.  I can make the most of it."

"event","The word on the street is that ""the claus"" has already begun to make his rounds across the world.  It'll probably be only a matter of time until his frosted boots alight upon our beige carpeting.  I've heard a number of rumors questioning the plausibility of Senor Cringle.  I realize that the sheer number of houses that the red blur must visit in the space of one night seems almost insurmountable.  I won't deny this fact.  However, I still refuse to adopt the common thread, the whispers of ""it's the parents"" hovering in the atmosphere.  I ask these detractors, Why would there be a santa man if the parent's just make all the christmas miracles themselves?  Certainly, there must be some service that he preforms in order to justify his being.  The latest findings in quantum physics more than sufficiently offer us some idea as to how exactly our st. Nick finds his way about our sphere in one nocturnal period.  The discoveries of matter randomly poping into existence into our universal plane provides us with a better understanding of exactly how these wrapped trinkets appear below our tree every year.
As for this year, my christmas requests were very distinct.  A new printer, possibly a scanner.  A DS game (yay).  The Scrubs and Arrested Development DVD sets. And money.  The latter of these things being the most important if I hope to survive after purchasing all the gifts for my friends and relatives.  I possibly broke last years spending record, but I don't really mind.  I just hope that every will be a bit more pleased with their gifts than they probably will be.
I actually spent quite an amount of time attempt to locate the gift for Laurie.  I went to several different stores, none of them yielding the fine DVD I had sought.  It took a Borders and a call from my mom in order to solve the problem.  Leah was a bit easier, I wasn't quite sure if I should give her something girly, but a phone call quickly settled the matter.  ""A video game.""  That, I can do sweetie.
For today, I'm expecting family over for our annual pre-Christmas showdown.  We usually eat together, laugh a bit, and then open up our gifts from across families.  Like most years, I expect to get a lot of that money I didn't really bother to ask for.  Like subatomic particles in the universe, it usually finds a way to show up without notice."

"event","Well, it's been a while, I realize, oh well.
I've been unable to really access a internet ready comp for a few days, so I had to backseat my journal once again.  Tragic really.  The good news is that I'm pretty much finished with all of my christmas shopping.  So now, I can just sit back and coast until sunday.  However, another one of my concerns is that I spent too much on people for the holidays.  Every year I've made it back, but I'm not so sure this time around.  It's obviously over 150 dollars.  I just hope that it's not too much this year, as I really do need the money.
After a few prayers I checked my grades online, and apparently the big man and I have both been doing our homework.  Good grades.  I got Bs in my English, and Cs in my spanish.  I'm fine with that.  I realize that there's a lot of stressed out people who can't seem to live with such mediocrity, but they're going to go on and live fruitful lives, so I don't feel bad for them.
I finished my copy of ""Being Dead"" a nice novel of 198 pages or so.  As my Theory of Novel teacher put it, ""it's about decomposing bodies.""  I really did enjoy it up until the end, where the narrative sagged a bit.  I found that I had lost interest at that point.  All my questions were answered.  Twenty pages left to go.  But the writing was noticibly modern, and quite entertaining.  I'm not sure if it's normal to want to hi-five the author at the end of a paragraph.  Sometimes, I feel, somebody should.  It's like a touchdown.
As for myself, I've started work on ""The Castle English"" my play about putting on an old play.  I've realized that my reluctance to begin my project is the lack of understanding of my characters.  I have a great list of names that just sits there.  I can't really say who most of them are.  They just need to be there.  As for the main plot, I have yet to really figure it all out.  Ah, the more I write about it, the more I realize I'm unprepared for it's creation.  I would like to simply shrink back into my previous work, it feel just so comfortable there."

"event","I just picked up Mario Kart not too long ago.  The online experience is almost everything we've been waiting for.  But finding people online is a tedious affair at best.  Too many times I've ended up with only one opponent.  It turns out that mario kart is not meant for two player.  It becomes this strange struggle back and forward.  Since the man in front is almost helpless (being that the item boxes yield crap to him) he easily gets picked out from the guy behind him.  Thus the dilema.  My most devious victory was such a game where we were approaching the finish line. I was a bit in front, but he had three mushrooms waiting and ready to spring.  So, I dropped back behind him in hopes that I could get something good from a item box.  There indeed turned out to be a blue shell there, which I unleashed upon my most likely cursing foe, and snatched victory away from him.  Don't feel too bad for him, this proves to be all too common in such matches.
Mario kart was made for eight players, four doesn't seem to cut it.  There simply has to be more people.  I feel that Nintendo needs to find a way in the next console iteration to have players join up more frequently.  It's painful to sit there, waiting for people to join up, watching their little boxes go on and off, knowing that there must be hundreds out there playing right now.  
The system of guildwars works so well that I suspect that something similar should be done.  In guild wars, a group of four battle another set of four about every four to five minutes.  The pace rarely slows down, as it usually only takes thirty seconds to find a new group to go up against (the chatting makes it go by faster as well). And one must also consider just how few people are playing Guildwars in that specific area in relation to what Mario Kart must be carrying now.  
If something similar were implemented, then people would be joining games more often, and the whole thing would feel a whole lot smoother.  Also, they should punish the drop out jerks.  They just decrease the fun steadily as you go along the four tracks.  I was elated to find four opponents just a while ago, but by the fourth race that number narrowed into two.  Ah well.
Strangely enough, I managed to find myself online.  I was a bit shocked that someone else not only used the exact same handle, ""cavalier,"" but he also used the same kart as I did.  We played many duel matches.  The total ended up in two ties and one win in his favor.  However, on our last outing, total victory was about to be mine until he was given a blue shell while I was ten yards from the finish line.  Now, I would say he was a better racer overall, in that instance, he simply stole the victory out from my grasp.
Laurie figured that my mysterious opponent was really my future self, come back to warn me in mario kart form.  It's difficult to precicely decipher the message, but I'd imagine it to be this: PUT DOWN THE DS AND GET BACK TO WORK LAME ASS.
How true."

"event","I had a tough weekend.
I spent most of my time in anticipation of two tuesdays.  Last tuesday I had two essays due and a Spanish Test.  Of course, Spanish test also mean that my workbook was due as well.  I prepared myself a schedule for which I could finish all these separate projects with some ease over the weekend.  This ideal I set out for myself did not come to fruition.
Friday I did basically nothing.
Saturday I did a little work on my identity paper for my Life writing class.  I had a bit of trouble getting it started.  In fact I began it with some random sentences that were stuck in my head.  It wasn't all that true, but I said it anyway.  This did not necessarily lead to an essay.  I ended up spending most of Saturday with Leah.  This was unplanned, but she had gotten into a spat with one of her roommates... so she didn't want to stay in her apartment.
Sunday I finished what I could, which did not amount to all that much.  I basically finished my identity essay.  As of late I've been receiving 7/10s on my essays for that class.  Since I've been writing about myself, I take this a bit more personally.  With the last one, I was determined to produce a lengthy and engaging essay.  It resulted in an almost ten page affair that meanders through various points in my life.  However, it all comes down to one point in the end, so it feels quite satisfying when it finishes.  If she doesn't at least acknowledge me this time, I honestly don't know what to do.  I refuse to boil my experiences into a manageable and expected structure.  I refuse to just give her what I think she wants.
Monday came and everything stared me in the face.  I checked the New U to find quite a shock.  Instead of printing the Taboo comic like I thought they would, they printed my original comic about the broken Gamecube.  It took up three fourths of the page.  It was huge. I honestly couldn't believe it, and I called Laurie immediately after seeing it.  Wow.  You should check it out if you get a chance.  Looking at it now, I know I could have done a better job with the space that they provided me.  It leaves a lot of people confused, and this leads me to consider my art more thoroughly.  It was just my first comic, and I hope that everyone finds the next one in greater favor.
As of my schoolwork... I had done a bit of work, but I had finished nothing.  So I labored over the spanish workbook and got it done.  Then, to start my Theory of Novel essay.  Starting meant reading the prompt.  I spent hours considering the prompt and reading the material.  I took an hour off to eat and watch Arrested Development.  It was absolutely hilarious so I don't regret it a bit.  When writing my essay my main mistake was not faithfully turning off the internet.  I kept returning to the Nintendo Wi-Fi stats page and exploring it's wonderful possibilities.
I suppose now is as good a time to tell you about the other tuesday I was anticipating...  Next tuesday Mario Kart and Tony Hawk both come out for the DS, and they are both online my friend.  Praise Be.  So throughout the whole time I was supposed to be writing my essay, I had both online nintendo games and ""Never You mind"" in my head.  I just couldn't focus at all.  I ended up spending the whole night writing the darn thing.  After I finished that essay, I spent a little time putting the end to my identity paper, and I was done.
In theory of Novel class, we turned in our essays.  Then we told the teacher that the online material we were supposed to read simply wasn't there.  So our teacher gave us the class off, and after she left we stayed and had an impromptu class support group.  Apparently, everyone is just as confused as I am ingorant of the material.  Because of this group, I can tell everyone here is an intelligent individual, it's just that the class is almost at graduate level course, and we don't feel like we're really on the bandwagon with this thing... I just hope she likes my essay to a certain extent.  I don't want any D's.
It doesn't matter.  the more I reflect on that essay, the greater it makes me feel that it's already done.  Honestly, I'm damn tired of academic essays."

Over the weekend, I had plans of all the things I would accomplish.  Very few things ended up happening.  On Saturday, Leah drove me, and Vivian to Target where I proceeded to be tempted by many a shiny things.  The prize in my mind was clear, I needed to get Arrested Development Season 1.  I found it, and there was much rejoicing.  But then I kept looking, and found myself the Schindler's List DVD.  I wanted that too.  So I snatched it up.  Then we all paraded down to the checkout, and I swiped my card giddily.
Not Approved.
This was an outrage.  I tried again, but with the same result.  SO I had to abandon my prizes, and we headed off to the local bank.  I was fraught with worry on the way there.  But the teller simply told me that the money was indeed there, and it was just a problem on their end.  Well...
So, to wrap it all up, I went to Gamestop and pre-ordered Mario Kart and Tony Hawk.
Then I said screw you to target and went to Best Buy.  I just ended up buying Arrested Development.  And then we went out for Hamburgers.
All of the schoolwork I meant to do over the weekend never came to fruition.
Monday turned out to be a busy day.
I checked the paper and my wonderful comic had managed to show up in good (or decent) form.  I'm am very pleased with it, but I feel a bit bad from breaking the thread of my other comic.  No matter.
Halloween at first, did not.  It didn't feel like the holiday at all... I felt a bit bad.  What made it worse was the Interview paper that I had to write about the interview that I had not done.  So yeah, it was a bit precarious as one might say.  However, at around two hours before midnight Laurie and Jessica appeared at our door all dressed up in unusual day clothing.  Laurie was the Autumn fairy (Aka crazy pirate grandmother).  Jessica was the generic Goth.  They invited me along, but I had so much work left, that I had to say, ""All right!""
SO I threw on a dress shirt and wrapped a red tie around my head... I became Shaun of The Dead!  So we began the carousing march around irvine in semi-costume.  It wasn't all that effective in the end... We meant to visit Kendra's house, but she was already in bed.  So, we were in the neighborhoods, so I paid a visit to Leah, and got one chocolate bar. Yummy.
The next day, I woke up early so I could finish my work.  All in all, tuesday turned out quite well."

But just a few days ago my roommate Daniel, stepped up towards Laurie and me (while we were watching code Lyoko mind you) and informed us that he would be gone for the rest of the quarter.  Apparently there are family matters to attend to, ones that require great attention.  He told us this about two minutes before he left.  Ah, well, I don't mind having the room to myself for a while.  It's actually quite nice.
But the whole thing was very sudden and I hope everything is all right.  I should probably use this opportunity to stop the newspaper.
Speaking of which, I spent about three and half hours working on my special Halloween comic.   It didn't turn out quite as I wanted it, but I don't worry much about that.  The first panel isn't as dark and dramatic as I hoped it would be, and I'm afraid that the font might have been a bad choice.  The art is a bit better than what the New U usually sees so I think it's acceptable enough.  For this week I put it under a different name ""Many Things"" (as in, this comic is many things) and under a different author ""Dr. Ostensible and the Left Kilt Brigade.""  I did this mainly because I didn't desire to raise suspicious from my christian group (though I doubt they'd mind much, it really is a rather harmless comic).  I also thought it would be a bit fun, and I managed to sneak in a nod towards Laurie within the pen name.  I doubt that she even noticed it though... Now, As much fun as it is working with Laurie on ""the project"" I often fear that I am testing her patience.  Fortunately, The next week's is already finished so she has plenty of time to edit it.
I'm looking forward to tomorrow because Leah will take me shopping.  I imagine we might grab something to eat as well.  I'm definitely going to pre-order my DS games, but I fear that I will give into more temptation.  I don't know what's been wrong with me lately."

Darn.
If I had known that our bridge could be named, then I would have been first in line... I mean, that's all the guy had to do right?  In any case, everyday as we cross the thin line between material goods and scholarly infusion, we are blessed with the sight of a construction worker.  He sits there behind a green gate barrier sawing away at the symbolic crevices.  ""WATSON BRIDGE""  It's a good enough name I suppose.  I was even tempted to take a picture of the man at work.  I probably should have.  In a few weeks the naming should be done, and we'll be well on our way to kicking and stepping on the good man's labor.
In other news, my beloved comic ""Toaster Fire"" received publication this week.  I am quite happy with this, and the strip fits quite nicely alongside it's peers.  I still have yet to really start on the work for the halloween strip.  I do fear that I shall be up late at night on Thursday.  We'll all see how it plays out.
I'm becoming more and more displeased with school.  It's boring and gotten to the point that I don't feel like I'm drawing anything out of it.  Last week in ""Theory of Novel"" we finally got to our first novel, and we spent the better half talking about a preface that wasn't even in my version of the text.  All I can say to that is ""Pleh."" And here I was looking forward to a nice good old session of interpretation...
Just today Laurie conviced me to take her out for a small bit of Jack in the Box (I still owe her money) and I complied with her wishes despite my undone homework.  I'm glad we did it because we ended up running into Crystal yet again.  So we sat down with a medium Dr. Pepper and listened to Crystal regale us upon her past experiences.  I enjoy talking to Crystal even though I end up doing very little of the talking.  I probably should have called her.  But that's really only one more name of the people I should have called.  I do miss Emily, Tanya, Keenan, and the other Krystal... but I never seem to bother to pick up the phone... What would I be able to say to some of them after so much time?
So finally, I feel that i am in need of material goods.  It's been over a month since I really bought something for myself.  I feel that sickly desire for DVD's and their ilk.  Mario Kart DS is nigh but not here.  I do suspect that with my newly received allowance I shall finally succumb to the allures of the ""Arrested Development"" DVD set.  I need my fix...  stupid baseball preempting stuff..."

This one will be short as I doubt that there is all that much to say.
I invited Laurie to come to our Weekly Writing Workshop.  We didn't actually have any material to go over, so we ended up at the Steelhead chatting the two hours away.  I think that Laurie enjoyed herself, but I wasn't entirely sure.  I still owe her for the onion rings.
Also, I've been getting mixed results with my Life writing class.  I got a 7/10 on my last essay which was about my education.  She wrote that I told a good story but it didn't seem to have any point.  Why was I writing this?  Why should the reader be interested in what I have to say?
I felt that this is a valid critique of a life essay, as there should be a reason that one would bother to put his/her time into reading about one's life.  Yet, I am still doing this for a class, and it was sort of presumptuous that my life would have any particular meaning to it.  I don't like the sappy crap.  I don't have overlying emotional thingies or what not.  My life has not been very traumatic.  So when I wrote her some cleverly written stories about my time in school, I sought to entertain her.  I honestly didn't know how else to attack the situation.  Ah, well, I do believe that adding the stories and characters from my relatives' past, that would help spice up my story.  Because my own personal narrative, it doesn't have that much to it."

She seems to have taken to it, but I find that it is now difficult to tell.  With all those times spent watching anime with Laurie, anyone who sits through an episode silently seems to have missed the enjoyment boat.
I find that I really do enjoy that anime, and I'm very glad that I am now in possession of the boxed set.
In other news, my comic strip, ""Toaster Fire"" as we fondly call it, was not publish by the New University.
All of the regulars were passed by this week in favor of a pathetic strip starring the three little pigs.  The humor in the strip is almost beyond grasp, as it is so very small in nature.  But it had an advantage from the get go I believe.  It seems to have been penned by the former opinion editor for the newspaper.  So this printing was more of a nod to it's creator than the actual comic.
I'm okay with this, but it is very apparent that the New U is not all that particular towards it's comic strips.  I believe that ""Toaster Fire"" was an excellent comic and I also got a chance to read this week's ""Sour Milk Sea"" and I don't remember it being funnier.  I expect to see my comic on the ""Antics"" page next week, but I can't help but be a little frustrated.  The ideas now are spouting out faster than the newspaper could print, yet I feel that many of them will end up in vain.
I suppose that this is merely a taste of the frustration that many comic artists around the world go through.
For Halloween, I'm planning a beautiful and imaginative strip that will require many hours to produce.  If it all turns out well, and they still neglect to print that, well... I wouldn't know what to say."

The first bit of news is that my comic strip was published by the New U.  This would essentially be the first instance of real publication.  Laurie and I can barely contain our excitement over the project.
For next week I worked on one concerning the unfortunate loss of our student center.
It was a bit long and we were running out of time so I stayed up late last night and finished a quick three panel strip about a toaster fire.  This turned out to be the best yet.  I'm certain they'll publish the former.
I've ended up meeting quite a bit of people in a strange and surprising way.  I met my old friend Crystal (who I hadn't seen since freshman year) and we talked together for quite some time.  It turns out that she married that dude and is currently living with him.  It makes me wonder how my all my other old friends are doing after all this time...
I also attended the second meeting of my writing workshop.  We only spoke about writing for a short period of time.  For the most part, we just ended up sitting around in Brita's Cafe talking about our lives.  We all happened to be children of divorce, and some of their stories were really interesting.  I do find that I have a genuine interest in people, and I usually like them even when their personality doesn't necessarily match with mine.  I don't honestly know why."

"event","Ah, the poor poor live journal got somewhat ignored this week.
Well, there were several highlights this week I would say.
For starters I managed to produce another comic strip for the New university.  Also, with Laurie's help I (actually she) came up with the name, ""Never You Mind"" for the strip.
Here's how it goes:
Person A: ""Why that's a good strip you got there""
Person B: ""Why yes it is""
Person A: ""What is the title of said strip of comic?""
Person B: ""Never You Mind""
Person A: ""I say!""
Person B: ""Indeed!""
This one is both shorter, more widely appealing, and just as good.  Laurie also managed to scan, clean, and print the product.  So if they don't print this, I honestly don't know what's up with them.
On Saturday, Leah and I went on our second date.  She took me to this Italian place, and my first thought while sitting down was something in the field of ""well, this is gonna hurt""
It wasn't so bad actually.  Leah also persuaded me to buy her a glass of Merlot.  I'm beginning to think my aversion to alcohol is related to my disliking of both coffee and tea... I may just have a drinking sweet tooth.  Maybe Keenan can hook me up with some Jewish spirits.
The food was really good, I was rather impressed with how much I enjoyed it.
After which we walked around and went to Nordstrom Rack (or something whatever) and then to Barns & Noble where I purchased ""Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are dead"" and the Garden State soundtrack.  The soundtrack is pretty awesome, and has a number of songs that I found to like.
Then we went to the theaters and I saw Corpse Bride for the second time.  I did decide that I enjoy that movie, however it felt like it was a bit too fresh in my mind when I saw it the second time.
However, a problem arose, when a man behind us thought it would be great to listen to rap music in the theater.  I assume he had headphones, but we could still hear it quite well.  It was down right rude.  Leah told me to turn around and yell at him to turn it down, but I couldn't really.  I failed her in that respect.  Leah eventually did it herself.
It's been apparent for some time that I'm nicer than she is.  This was the only time in our relationship that ever felt like it was debilitating.  Ah, well...
As for my emails, still no responses, I do believe I will have to send more out."

Sigh, It's all ready Wednesday and I've forgotten to tell you so much.
Well, the first bit is that my comic was not selected for the new university.  There is a little hope left for it though, because no comic was chosen for the new university.  Yes, they did have a few one panel pieces that related towards the articles they sat beside, but no comic strips.
I still wonder about my comic though... if it was in fact good enough, and if I will ever get the original back... in retrospect, giving her my original drawing was rather foolish.
I've been checking my emails a lot lately, looking for letters from people who won't write back.  I may never get back my drawings from my Beginning Drawing teacher, that girl from the newspaper seems to take a very impersonal approach to all this buisness, and Alex may have effectively disappeared from the earth itself.  As for Mrs. Pfaff, well I shouldn't expect a letter anytime soon.
But then again that reminds me that I do have some letters to reply to of my own...
No matter right now...  tomorrow I will finish this week up on a hopefully good note.
I've done most of the work for my classes thus far, and I feel that this quarter will go smoothly.

I already feel like a different man.
The prospects of publishing my play feel very real.  Closer than ever before.
And by tomorow morning I will learn if my comic was accepted into the newspaper or not.
More importantly, is my current attachment to Leah.
I am her first boyfriend.  A daunting title, indeed.
Our date went well, as you should suspect.  I wore my suit and bought her a bouquet of pink roses.  I ordered a hamburger, and then watched her for half an hour as she worked on her Balsamic Chicken.  Then I took her back to my apartment, and we held one another against the backdrop of the Life Aquatic DVD menu.
I could go into more details, but relationships are filled with such frivolous and pointless things, that I fail to see the need.
My point is that we were a couple by the end of the night.
I have to admit that I was weary of committing to that assertion so soon in the game.  But when she spoke during our date, her words were filled with this understanding that there would be something between us.  She speaks much more than I do.  Already my head is filled with the knowledge of her past acquaintances, friends, and teenage drama.  Yet she knows hardly anything of my friends or much of my ambition.
But I like holding her and saying little.  I like to watch her when her eyes are closed.  I'd like to discover what it is that makes her beautiful.
It just might be that our most compatible quality is necessity.
But don't feel like letting go.
What I really want now is for her to get along with my friends.  That way, I won't be torn between two places.  Hopefully, everything works out for the best."

"event","I've just finished my first week of classes, and boy what a week it is.
I put the last touches on my comic strip and submitted it to the University newspaper.  Walking to their office is a bit scary.  First you sort to have to go through a mini quest just to find the place.  The email I got literally described their office as the place behind the dumpsters.  What it didn't predict were the group of day laborers circling the area, and the old elevator that seemed less than reliable. I was hoping I would get to meet the girl who would potentially approve my comic.  No such luck.  Nobody there really even looked at me, so I just stuffed the paper into the mail slot and removed myself from the premises.
I'm now anxiously awaiting their response.  There's no doubt in my mind that it's funny enough to print (they've printed much worse), but it is a lengthy strip, and that could hinder it's approval.
I've also finalized my schedule.  I'm keeping the english life writing class and dropping poetry.  All for good reasons.  My requirements to graduate call for a English 105 class, and apparently I didn't meet the prerequisite for beginning poetry.  Oh well, less work for me.
My theory of Novel class appears to be difficult.  I didn't do the first reading (Handout), but I may not have missed out on much.  Perusing some of the pages in class, I discovered that the author had yet to be acquainted with the simple sentence structure.  The document was like a medical dissertation, but I still managed to comment on it.  However, It turned out that being stingy with my attention led me to miss the first assignment.  But I won't let it happen again.
I'm going to purchase the rest of my books tomorrow.  I just hope that they don't total much over a hundred.
Finally, I attended the first writing workshop with my old beginning fiction teacher (who shall forth be known as Ariane).  There were only two other people there, Robin, an older looking girl with large sunglasses, and the other dude who's name I forgot... Sigh.  Next week I should have something for us to read.  I just don't know what exactly that will be."

I'll try to work harder.
Actually, there have been a lot of things that haven't been much attended to lately.  My virtual dogs are now learing the other meaning of the word ""fast,"" and as for my attendance for my Guild in Guild Wars, well screw it.
On saturday Leah called me back at a bad time, I mean right in the middle of Evil Dead 2, but I didn't mind it much.  I had decided to do it, so I did.  I asked her out for next Saturday, and she responded with something to the effect of ""Wow, um, sure.""  Interpret this as you want.
The point is, I am now a dating man.
Doing so has put me in an awkward limbo of a relationship.  I don't really want to see her that much this week because our relationship is on unfounded ground.  I honestly don't know what to do with her.  More on that later though.
On Sunday I went to see the Corpse Bride with Laurie and Co.  It gets my approval.  I avoided spending too much money on material things.  I realize now that if I'm going to be taking girls out, I will have to save some cash for that.
On Monday I had my spanish class for the first time in about a year.  The teacher's a little crazy, half of the vocabulary words he pronounces seem to be intertwined with a sporadic orgasmic flair.  It appears to be a fun class over all.
Today was the big special.  I had all my classes lined up in a row like planets on doomsday.  First was English 106 which turned out to not be the same class that Laurie was taking.  Oh well.  I'm in a odd Life Chronicling class, while she's in Medieval Drama (they get to act).  I'll see if my schedule will allow a switch.  
My second class was ""Theory of Novel."" I came in several minutes late due to some wonderful little printing story in which I don't care to regale.  It wasn't fun.  The class seemed to be a bit boring despite  the teacher's ""chemistry explosion"" hairdo.  We discussed the idea of theory vs. something else.  I don't know...
Third class: Spanish again, complete with more questions that I can vaguely understand.
All throughout the day I accidentally met up with various people I knew.  I saw my old Beginning Fiction teacher three times.  I saw Kari twice (let her go by both times, not because I don't like her but it wasn't the best timing).  I met up with Keenan's friend, and saw Devina twice.  there may be more.  But unfortunately no Keenan or Alexandria.  But I did have a good chat with my old fiction teacher.  She told me she still reads my letter to her class at the beginning of every quarter.  I told her about my play and she said I should start talking to the drama people from the school.  She also invited me to a thursday fiction workshop with some former students of hers.  The only problem is that it would conflict with my poetry class...
I went to Beginning poetry (my fourth class) with the intention to drop it.  That hasn't changed really.  I would much rather spend some thursday afternoons working on wonderful short stories.  Also, Sonia (who had taken BegFic with the same teacher) should be there, proving my silly prediction wrong.  We'll just have to see.
And today was the final welcome dinner for the christian club.  I saw Leah, and we talked for quite a while.  I'm having second thoughts, but I will have dinner with her on Saturday.  I owe her that.  There used to be a lot of reasons why I wouldn't ask a girl out, creating this web that would never let anything through.  I'm trying to drop those guards, but I'm beginning to realize that I might not be cut out for careless dating.  I just feel like a fool, with various emotions and desires pulling me every which way.  The thought of actually having someone to wrap my arms around leads me to belive that I can withstand a little bit of incompatibility.  Now I'm begining to realize why every body else does the stupid things they do.  Despite my intent to date Leah, I can't stop thinking about Grace (recent crush).  So I suddenly feel a cliched teen drama has been thrust upon me.  I finally snagged something I felt that I wanted only to start looking back.  I'm just a fool."

It was only about a week and a half.  Not even really.
I'm sorry for the lack of updates, I'll try to avoid letting that happen again.
I went back home for my brother's birthday.  I went to the local EB to get him a DS game, when I spied a lovely (used) Escaflowne DVD set for only 71 dollars.  I was even tempted to call Laurie so we could workshop the idea of me purchasing this delightful thing.  I eventually decided to leave it where it was and just by Advance Wars for David.
His birthday wasn't all that exciting and he didn't seem to be very excited over his presents.  I can't help it if there's nothing out for him right now.  Wait a few more months.
On the weekend I went over to my Dad's and ate at the Red Onion with them.  As I was entering the restuarant, Laurie called me and told me she would be getting back to the apartment on Wednesday.  I took the opportunity to ask her whether I should get the Escaflowne DVD set for only $71.
""Hell yes"" was her answer.
All right then.
I had previously decided that I should paint a picture for my mother's birthday.  That would require a canvas.  I asked Ruth (Grandma-in-law) to drive me around, and she was more than happy to.  So on monday she took me to Michaels where I acquired a new canvas for $5.99 (50% off coupon) and then to EB for a used Escaflowne DVD set for only $60 (Marked down!).  Material happiness ensued.  I watched the first three episodes while I waited for the Gesso to dry on my canvas.  
On Tuesday I started the actual painting, and it turned out to be what I would consider my best work yet.  It was a desert scene with a woman and a guitar.  I employed a lot of various colors and a spiral techniques for both the sand and sky.  Very nice.  The woman is a bit short but we won't worry about that.  I finished the painting within a day because I wouldn't have the time the next day.
Wednesday was meant to be a busy day.  I would wake up early and walk over to the dentist for my 10:00 appointment.  I did that.  Then I would walk over to the DMV and get my learner's permit renewed.  I didn't do that.  I and don't particularly regret it.  It was unbearably hot that day, so much so that the blueberry icee that I purchased was like a fine wine to me.  I doubt it should ever taste that good again.  After I had filled myself with blue ice, I walked over to my old high school.  I planned to be there at around 2:20 (which is when it gets out) so I might not have made it if I went to the DMV.  I honestly didn't know what to expect as I approached my old campus.
I checked Mr. Hamilton's old room and I didn't find him there (turns out he left for Boston).  So I went over to talk to Mrs. Ardalan because I hadn't seen here in a while.  I asked her if Mrs. Pfaff would be here because I suspected that she might be on maternity leave.  Mrs. Ardalan informed me that Mrs. Pfaff's baby had died.  I don't believe it was a miscarriage.
The last time I had seen here was in January, when she told me with a smile that she was expecting.  She wasn't showing at that point and it was still supposed to be a secret from the students.  I don't really know what to say.
Mrs. Pfaff was there, and I was able to talk to her.  She had indeed begun to read my script, but she just hadn't been able to get back to me on it yet.  I'm usually a little peeved at how Mrs. Pfaff consistently fails to respond to my attempts to present my script to her.  But talking to her tends to put those feelings aside.  That was especially true this time around.  She told me she liked my script so far and that she wanted to do it.  She already has plans for the fall play, but maybe it can be the spring production.  She was just worried that we might not find someone able to play Sherlock Holmes.  I felt the same way, but I really want this to be produced, so I urged her to produce it in this spring.
We'll just have to see.  For now Mrs. Pfaff has to finish my play and see if we have the talent it requires.  I just hope everything works out.
I presented my painting to my Mother for he birthday.  She liked it quite a bit, and it's now on the wall back at home.  We had cake and then I was promptly shipped back to the apartment.
I've successfully spent some time with Laurie (and Jessica) and I got my birthday present from Laurie.  I got a cool new key chain, a Mario set thingy, and a Naruto CD. These things were pretty awesome, so I was feeling particularly generous we we went to Alakazam for her present.
As of now, I've attended two Welcome Dinners for the Christian Club and have been recruited to speak for the final one on tuesday.  The ideas are already spinning in my head.  At the meetings I met a reasonably attractive girl named Leah.  We talked for over an hour on Thursday, and did what I considered to be flirting Today.  I vaguely asked her out by handing her my a scrap of paper with my phone number and the words ""call me.""  
Now, I recall watching Katie while she gave a little message at the meeting, how her voice wavered and her body shook as she said her little part.  I marveled at how talking in front of a respectable audience made her so nervous, but it would be nothing for me.  
But I could barely walk after handing Leah that piece of paper.  And I don't even like her all that much yet.  She has trouble pronouncing her R's.  What am I supposed to do with myself?
At least this all is progress.  I hope."

"event","Well, everything's done now.
Last week, I turned in a take home test for my Linguistics class.  It came back with a 94/100.  That's good.   Today I woke up at around nine and studied for the final.  I really can't say I've really put in all the effort I could for this class.  But it seems to have been sufficient.  I ended up studying for about two hours, and that's all I really needed.  I came to the test feeling pretty confident and left it the same way, plus that elated feeling.
Yesterday I turned in my final for my drawing class.  I am a bit disappointed by my self portrait only by the fact that it doesn't look like it took me six hours to draw.  This is mostly because it didn't.  three and a half at most.  It's a good picture though.
I drew a small comic for my teacher in my sketchbook.  Someone told me I should send it to the campus newspaper.  I think I will.  Their paper only comes out every week, and it is sorely lacking in a good comic strip.  So I now officially have the goal of becoming a cartoonist for the ""New U.""  I'm going to do it.  I have other ideas, and I have just enough talent to me by.
As for my play, well, no go.  I haven't heard anything yet, and now I doubt if I ever shall.  I suspect that it was once again, put to the side, unread.  I think it's too late right now, they should be starting the auditions for whatever play they chose relatively soon.  It's just awful to be ignored.  There's a little hope left though, so we'll see.
Actually, I think I'm going to get started on my next play.  I really enjoy writing them, and after that I really enjoy reading them, even if no one else does.  This next one's going to be different.  It's going to be bold and unapologetic.  Probably terrible, but I'll still love it.
The point is, I'm done with summer school.  Tonight I will be heading home for my brother's birthday.  He's already 12.  My, how time flies."

I still haven't gotten any email regarding my play, so I just assume that they will get it tomorrow.  I'm really hoping that I will get some sort of response.  I just need something.
As I previously said, I've been wondering how to fill the extra time that writing had taken.  I've been thinking about my next project.  I have a number of other ideas for plays, and I would like to get started on them.  The prospects of starting another play is a bit daunting, and I feel that it may once again get ignored by the rest of the world.  But I don't care anymore.  I've been playing the fool for a long time now, what's one more day?
In other news, my ear has become congested.  It feels like in an airplane, ready to pop, but nothing seems to release the pressure.  Maybe my eustachian tube is blocked or something.  It's really bothering me, and I wasted like 15 dollars trying to treat the symptom.  Word of Advice: don't mix ear medications, they somehow combine into burning.  Ah well, maybe by tomorrow everything will be better.

P.S. Happy Birthday to Laurie during this general birthday phase.  Have a good one."

"event","First Off: OMG. http://dvd.ign.com/articles/649/649280p1.html 
I'm really going to miss those thirty dollars.  It's like fate has just forced them down the toilet of unearthly glory.  But it's still a toilet.
Secondly, fate gave me break yesterday and I was able to choose a take home test for my syntax class.  The worse thing I could probably do is to wait to do it until hours before it's due.  But I think I shall because that's just how I opperate.
And finally, I realize that it's been a while since I've spoken about my drawing class so here we go.
We started shading about two weeks ago, and it has proved a little difficult for me.  I haven't used charcoal much before this class.  I never really cared for charcoal, but this class has made me a new man.  As far as charcoal goes, that is.
On Tuesday I turned in an image of my desk lamp that I thought was rather nice.  I found myself to be somewhat in error, as Amy (our teacher) still said that I simply was not using enough value in my drawing.  That was a bit hard for me.  But no matter.  After that we proceeded to actually start drawing real people. I don't believe I've had more fun in class.  I love drawing people, I just hadn't really realized this since I've never really gotten the chance before.  I drew about five people that day.  I think the teacher kind of wanted us to focus on one person, but I couldn't help myself.  I find that I really enjoy the ""loose hard"" style where you can really see the marks that I made in my drawings.  A lot of people smooth out their charcoal marks really finely, but I don't.  It does result in a very sketchy look, but I enjoy it tremendously.  For my final portrait on Tuesday, I drew an Asian guy who looked rather like a geek.  No Offense.  But when I took my charcoal to the paper, he was a modern samurai.  Mainly, I just gave him a pissed off expression, and depicted him several times cooler than reality bears.  It was freaking awesome.  To return the favor, he drew me like a neanderthal with glasses.  Yeah, my self esteem can only take so many hits in one day.  Thanks man.
Thursday was different though.  We were still doing portraits, but we were going to spend the whole time on only one.  So it better turn up good. Sonia and I chose to do each other's portraits, which was what I had wanted to do all along.  Sonia is the girl from my painting class and I've gotten to know her over the few weeks that we've spent together.  When I started my work on her portrait I thought it was turning out pretty well, but as you work along you find things that just arn't quite correct.  It is as I have mentioned, how good art looks good at first glance and only gets worse from then on.  I had to fix all of that out.  I pushed my values this time around; I didn't want to make any mistakes, not with Sonia's portrait.  
You see, Sonia is absolutely gorgeous, and I cannot quite express just how spectacular it was to look at that face for a whole of two and a half hours and draw.  I imagine that when I get a girlfriend I will want to spend an unwarranted amount of time simply drawing her.  I do wonder how many artists fall in love with their subjects, because it is not a difficult thing to do.  I soon became aware about every little detail that made her beautiful, and then attempted to capture it in some seemingly impossible way.
My portrait of Sonia doesn't quite live up to the real thing.  But there is indeed an attractive girl staring back at me whenever I view it.  She resembles the original, so I'm satisfied with it.
And as for Sonia's picture of me; well, she drew my nose too small, so I don't think I've ever looked better.
I started this class within my LJ and now I'm about to finish it.  Over the weekend I will finish my final drawing for the class and simply turn in a portfolio on Tuesday.  I think I'm going to sign up for the next drawing level.  This has been really good for me.  I doubt I'll ever see Sonia again, but as of late I've gotten used to saying goodbye to my friends.   Besides, there's a lot of friends that I never really did even get a chance to say good bye to.  At least I have a picture to remind me."

"event","And so ends the busy half of my Week.  I was pretty much working non stop (breaks for eating and sleeping) from monday afternoon to one o'clock Wednesday.  I stayed up until three last night, and now I am finally done with my script.
I woke up at around nine and headed off towards the library to print out my creation.  But then I thought, ""Hey Daniel, you clever guy, why not print it out at Kinkos? It's closer.""  So I set my eyes on Kinkos and plopped a fiver into one of those debit cards of theirs.  I went to the printing station and ordered 124 pages of simple text (I was printing two copies).  At which time it gave me a nice little notice that the print job would cost me $63.40.  I shit you not.  I ran away from Kinkos, having realized it to be the satanically inclined temple that it is, and rushed over to the library.  There, I discovered that I no longer possessed the fourteen dollars that it would need for my 124 pages, as five of it were now so irrevocably donated to the church of Kinkos.  
So I hurried over to the ATM, where I curiously met my old ""Beginning Fiction"" teacher, and then back to the library.  The previous ordeal made those warm newly printed sheets feel all that much more satisfying.  Despite all my previous toil, I still felt like diving right back into my work even as the sheets were still printing.  I don't care about my Syntax Class, and I don't care much about any essay I write.  I don't even proofread those anymore.  But when it comes to my art, be it writing or drawing, then I know that something's actually there with me.  Even if it amounts to so very little.  But for now the future is in the hands of the united states postal service.
Both Mrs. Pfaff and Mr. Hamilton will soon have my improved script and my email address.  And I am honestly almost dying of anticipation for what the following weeks just might deliver."

Despite all the progress I previously had accomplished on my play, I haven't actually touched it in a while.  As much as I enjoy ""Wonderfalls,"" I don't feel the marathon runs were doing much good for me.  It's my choice to sit there, though.  Yet, I fear I won't be able to finish my play quite as soon as I had hoped.  It should be all right.
Laurie, Heidi, Jessica, and I went swimming at the pool today. There, I developed the the wonderful idea to attack laurie's foot in a high risk underwater assault.  Bad news on that again, and now I have a scar on my face to show for it.  I was apparently either in a fight, or the water badgers got me. I'm not quite sure.  Laurie never actually realized that my face was in the direction she was kicking, and she continued to apologize for it afterward.  The only thing that I really regret is that the mark doesn't look very cool.  Perhaps I should have swam a little more to the left.
Tomorrow I will wake up early.  We will journey to Target in order to find something that I doubt is still there.  But they will have a clock.  And we really could use one of those."

"event","Here's to pointless posts!
Today I felt the sweeping desire for some authentic mother's circus animal cookies.  I'm certain that you're familiar with them, the two color treats that come in a variety of vague animal shapes.  Why, I sat at my desk just imaging myself eating them until I was sick with frosty pink and white.  You know that twinge in your stomach when you've just eaten too much of the same product?  That was one of the many side quests for today.  And Let's just say, mission accomplished.  While I did leave the greater majority of my little sugary menagerie still in the bag, I think that seventeen of those is all that it probably takes.
As for good news, well... As part of my new (and barely existent) exercise regimen, I visited our local pool and learned how to sink.  It turns out that I'm relatively buoyant when I hold in a large breath, but when my lungs are empty, I fall so fast that it worries me a little.  So I spent some quality time with the bottom of the pool.  I actually found it rather peaceful to lie down flat at the base of the five feet mark.  I'd probably enjoy it more if half of my brain wasn't screaming out for air. Yet I find that I am quite capable of staying down there for a good ten seconds, and I probably will get better over time.  It is an experience which I recommend almost everyone should try.  Just remember to keep your eyes open, that's where all the magic happens."

"event","Today, as on Wednesday, I arrived fashionably late to my Syntax class.  There is simply something about that class that conjures up a deep distaste for appearing on that roll call.  Perhaps it's my preference for the phonetic side of linguistics, or maybe it's my inner frustration with the complicated nature of the course.  But I'm rather willing to bet that it's the fact that looking at the grass outside my window is a nigh orgasmic experience when in comparison to one session of syntax.
As of late, i've taken up the habit of bringing my sketchbook to the class and just letting myself go.  At this point, very few objects in that room have been left undocumented.  Today, I started a comic strip starring my unknowing class mates.  It's not finished nor very complicated, but I've managed to pick off a few people who know how to remain still for a minute.  Sigh... I really don't feel like I'm learning in that class at all.
But good news for you all.  My midterm came back as an 83/100.  My original plan was that if I got a D, then I would buckle down, do the reading, and so forth.  If I got a C, then I would pursue a decent amount of studying before the final.  Now, with this B-, I doubt I'll even show up at all.
Oh yes, and the other day I discovered something nice.  It turns out that the wonderful aromas produced in our bathrooms are summarily pumped out to greet our guests at the front door.  While I am glad to have solved the mystery, I can't help but feel a bit displeased with this revelation."

"event","Way back on Sunday, I had begun my work on my drawing project, when a sudden feeling of laziness swept over me.  So, being myself, I set a plan that would maximize my procrastination potential, while maintaining a hint of plausibility.  I know it wasn't very original, but the ""do it before class"" strategy really seemed to be the answer.  That meant that I was supposed to wake up at ten today, which I nearly did, and then finish the inked landscape of my back porch.  I thought it amusing that I took up my brush again (which I had sworn never to do) to fight the evil land of Philistia.  At that moment, it felt a heck of a lot like painting all over again.
Just to spice the picture up, we were told to find a ""master drawing"" off the web, and then incorporate it into our work.  I pretty much chose the first item that a google image search yielded.  This proved to be a sketch of a nude man's backside.  It was rather well drawn, so into my porch he went.  I then finished all the trees, walls, and buildings, and dropped a cup of joe into the good man's raised hand.
""Nude tribute to morning."" by Daniel Murrell
Done and Done.
In class, the teacher seemed to be a bit impressed by it, at least to some degree.  At least I got her to laugh.  I mean, I thought the picture was pretty amusing.  She commented that it looks like I inked it with a cat's tail.  My brush was a bit frayed when I used it, but if she says it works then I'm fine with it."

"event","Big Day planned today.  First, it was get up study for the syntax midterm, i.e. learn all the stuff you ignored in class, and then take the final.  I realize this plan seems a bit odd but it worked out well enough.  My guess (and I might eat my words later) is a C or better.  More likely a C.  I nailed some sections but others parts of my test wouldn't pass the seismograph test.... Well, I thought it was clever.
After that I would hike a great three miles to the local gamestop and pick myself up a smoking copy of Nintendogs.  Yep, I'm just that masculine.  Turns out, bad news on that though.  Despite what IGN says, the release date for the game is tomorow.  Oh how I wanted something new for my DS.  Meteos will have to do for a bit longer.  But I did buy Baten Kaitos (spelling?) and discovered it's profound okayness by the first hour into the game.  I highly suspect that a group of expert volunteers were selected for the voice acting, and I really wish I could have done something to fix up the dialogue in the first place.  But then again, at some point I decided that the female lead should have been wed to the god of destruction, so it's probably for the best.  Well, I just hope it gets better... 'cause it's gonna be a long ride."

"event","The beta fish of Miss Christine Chen appeared to be at death's door when I visited her apartment.  It's fins were torn, and it perferred to spend it's time clinging to the greenly tinted surface.  Our solution: change the water.  So she placed the poor thing into cup, and we emptied out the enormous glass jar it called home.  She resolved to put thirty drops of water purifier from now on.  
Christine has a way of worrying about things like this... I had helped the fish previously (by simply telling her to feed it more often), but this time the situation felt a bit more dire.  Christine put three extra drops in the new mixture of water that was to save ""China"" from an early grave.  The fish curled and fought as it reentered the jar.  Maybe it was showing a bit more spunk now... nope, it then proceeded to ooze out a disturbing green liquid (bile?) and then started to sink down to the bottom of it's bowl.  It would fight, swimming right back to the surface when it normally hung, but only to slowly drift back downward.  Christine began to cry as she watched her fish struggle with it's apparent fate.
Watching something die in front of me isn't something I'm quite used too.  Especially while I stand there helpless to save the poor thing... not so much for the fish, but because Christine's seemed so attached to it.
We took it out and buried it next to the pool.  I'm not too struck by the whole ordeal, but clearly Christine was a bit. She called herself a fish murderer, and I said that it wasn't true. it must have been sick.  She asked me if it was sad, and I said ""I guess so"".  She asked if it was in pain when it went, and I replied ""probably"".  I didn't want to patronize Christine.
If you find yourself smirking a bit, just remember that Christine is probably the nicest girl I've ever known, even if a little emotional.  I had told her in the car ride that I was a little bit lonely, so she decided that we should go to the beach.  She can lie on the shore and get a tan, while I draw the landscape for my art class.  I'll tilt the picture just enough to get all the trees, the people, the little chapel where couples get married, and the parasols...
Just right after we save her fish."

"event","I think I managed to disappoint my drawing teacher today.  I rather failed at my homework of making line squares... somehow I found a way to get it into my mind that we were supposed to do seven instead of twelve.  And then I didn't use water in my ink, and I totally forgot about these ""master drawings"" we were supposed to bring.  Three strikes, you're out.
My picture that I worked on today turned out okay, but it was in charcoal so I couldn't really work it like I wanted to.  Both my teacher and I thought my preliminary sketch was better than the final product.  She said I was more loose with the sketch.  I called it dumb luck.
Also, I've been gradually building a crush with the girl in drawing who I knew from my painting class.  We pretty much talked the entire session today.  This isn't allowed at all.  She's attached and outa my league (if you'll bear another baseball reference).  I shouldn't worry really, it's okay to just talk.  But it kind of makes me miss talking to Marleen.  Or Tanya for that matter.
While we're on the topic of Talking.  I spent the afternoon with the Egans Yesterday.  We had In-N-Out and then went for a dip in the local pool.  I spent half the time catching their youngest as he jumped into the shallow end.  After that I came back and talked with Rob for two hours.  We just shared various things from our lives.  Hearing about his life lead me to wonder what's still in store for me now.
At the moment it's my script.  I just hope I can finish it in time to meet that invisible deadline.
For all I know it may already be too late."

"event","The assignment for tuesday was to draw a three hour picture.  So Monday night, I plopped down In front of my desk and went to work on drawing my desk.  When I actually got to the class I discovered that many people stole my idea.  I rather enjoyed it, sitting there drawing my little naruto figures while listening to my music.  All homework should be that easy.
Unlike my painting class, I feel that I am able to deliver something a small cut above most of my classmates.  I think it just means that I've been drawing for too long for basic drawing.  And I suspect that few of the people here are art majors.  But the teacher did compliment my work, so that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside.
Actually I do feel pretty good right now.  I have been working.  I worked on my painting over the weekend, and I've been fixing up my script for production.  I just hope that Mrs. Pfaff will take it seriously this time around.  For all I know, she might be on maternity leave.  I'll just give it to Mr. Hamilton.  It'll be okay.  My point is that I'm pleased with what I'm doing this summer.  I'm relatively busy, and I could actually finish the things that I need to finish.
As for my script, well, the things that I didn't like so much have started to vanish, and I believe that it is an even better piece for it.  I fixed a number of problems and I have actually managed to make it funnier in certain places.  I think it's a good play.  It's not really all that great. But it's a good fun play that should be a pleasing way to spend an hour and a half.  I just hope that She sees it that way."

"event","I've finally managed to find time for my painting again.  Actually I think I've had the time, I just haven't used it much.
Anyway, I worked a bit yesterday and finally finished the girl's head.  I tried to do it in just one go so that I wouldn't have to remix the color of her skin.  I failed.  I thought I could be happy with her look, but I came back to it and was just a bit horrified.  That's usually a sign that something needs fixing.  So I bit the bullet and mixed up the red and raw sienna and the yellow... a little bit of green... close enough.  My second attempt proved to be much better.  She's actually attractive and that part of the painting rather resembles a Renaissance piece.  I'm really good with the way it looks.
Today I came back to it and started on the background.  I decided to do a country scene behind them.  My idea was that they were sitting in front of a flat for the production.  This is a little difficult I realize because I am in essence doing a painting of a painting.  I only really managed to paint the hill behind the girl, and I am still unsure it all of this will look decent after I'm done.  You see the flat background will not quite be able to comply with the lighting on the figures, you see my problem.  I guess my only choice is too finish it as best as I can, and hope it turns out good.
But don't worry.  I think it will.
On a side note, I bought and watched KungFu Hustle yesterday.  I thought it was pretty entertaining, and I think Laurie will get a kick out of it when she comes back to visit."

"event","Yesterday, Laurie returned to her home after an attempt to maximize her time with her friends down here in Irvine.  Thanks to her visit the apartment is now clean and newly organized.  I found it a bit difficult to find things today as I rummaged around the fridge for my usual sustenance.  All for the better though.  Laurie was quite considerate in giving me a set of nintendo pins and a pristine naruto dojinshi.  I still haven't quite figured out what I will get her for her birthday, but I did think of a trick to play on her when she gets back.  We'll all see how things unfold in the coming days.
I still need to call Emily and see how she's doing...
Today turned out to be a bit difficult for me.  I just had my first real drawing class.  This whole ""basic drawing"" thing is proving to be difficult.  I was particularly disappointed at hearing that drawing human figures was something that we would not be learning in this class though it is the thing that I would like to focus on the most.  Rather, we spent the first two hours drawing chairs and.... well... more different chairs.  We were told to gesture draw these objects on our recently purchased newsprint paper.  So I took out my trusty vine charcoal and sketched away.  It got old real quick.  Later she threw tons of random crap into the mix hoping to liven up the drawing area.  I was particularly amused how so many of my painting bottles had managed to make a triumphant comeback.  At the end of the second half of the class I was still struggling to find new objects to portray.  She kept telling us to start new sketches and I was soon out of material.  At the last hour we were assigned to pencil a contour sketch.  Easy enough.  Actually, I must say that I was mostly pleased with the way it came out.  My teacher's only complaints were that I wasn't quite conforming to the ""contour"" style rather than saying that there was something wrong with my drawing's perspective.  My only problem with the class is that I won't be able to draw all the stuff I really want.  Maybe I should welcome the challenge.
I almost bought a cake today.  Kind of strange, I realize.  I was feeling a bit lonely, and perhaps a bit depressed.  In walked over to Abertsons in a stupor and paced around the dessert aisle as if in some sad reverse mating dance.  It was even on sale.  Four dollar savings.  Vanilla icing.  I eventually decided that whatever it was that currently kept me down wasn't something that could be fixed with six dollar cake.  No cookies, no DVDs, no video games.  Something else I guess.   Perhaps a little time. I guess I'm a little mad at myself.  There are so many things that I have to get finished soon, that I don't honestly know if I can do it.  I just have to push myself, that might be the only way."

"event","I was late to my three o'clock class of basic drawing.  I can place the blame for this squarely at Laurie and her tetris playing whims.  I was a little nervous about being late as I arrived at Art Studio room 260.  But I really didn't miss anything.  She gave up a half sheet of paper in which to describe our goals for the course and our art experience.  I wrote that I needed work on my anatomy and consistency, and that I've been drawing for a long time now.  She came back in full with a long list of materials for the class.  I honestly fear that she made some of that stuff up right on the spot.  I was really hoping it would be just a pad and paper, but then again I am looking forward to working with ink.  However I am a bit down about how I will have to draw a lot of things that I wouldn't normally draw.  No phalluses fortunately, but I like to cartoon and there will be little of that in this class.  Rather, she chose to teach us a sketch technique where we focus on the object and not the art.  Namely, look at the office material and not the paper.  I don't actually believe that I've ever really viewed a stapler before, and my sketch of it seemed to comply with that assertion.  
Our plans with Alexandria and Jessie took and mild twist today.  She called me at five to change our meeting time from six to eight.  Then again later that evening to ""twenty minutes more""... They didn't arrive until nine thirty. It's kind of funny how things usually end up that way, but I was okay with it.  We ended up seeing the wedding crashers (which I had wanted to see for quite a while) and really enjoyed it.  I only regretted that we wern't able to spend more time with them.  
Alexandria has a funny way of looking different every time I see her.  She seems to be turning more and more into a mature adult, and I keep wondering more and more what it was exactly that makes us friends.  She told us about how her family seems to be getting out of hand (if she'll permit the expression) and I can't begin to imagine myself in her shoes.  I believe that even without her good looks she would still be perhaps the most intriguing woman I've ever known."

The good news is that Laurie has comeback from Japan, the bad news is that I never actually got a chance to finish my painting or do something to clean up the apartment.  Ah well it didn't matter much.  Laurie pretty much tore through the apartment today leaving everything lemony fresh in her wake.  I'm rather glad that our apartment is more presentable now, but I feel a bit bad that Laurie had to do most of this when she got back.  It felt really odd just how much got done today, between the cleaning and my Linguistics class the day just felt packed.  
I think it's pretty obvious that I've been missing my friends over the summer break, and I'm glad that Laurie came over to visit.  I'm also looking foward to seeing Alexandria tommorow.  It'll be nice to see her again."

"event","I had trouble sleeping last night.  This is sort of normal for me, but in this case the thoughts that kept me up this time were unusually wieghty. I think it's time that I get everything together.  I am going to rewrite my play for the third time, and I am going to make Mrs. Pfaff recognize me.  She told me May, and I gave it to her in May.  Now it's August and she hasn't sent even a signle email my way.  There's not a whole lot of time left.  By the end of this month I will fix all the little problems left in my script and I will send it to her again.  And perhaps I will keep sending her letters until she responds.  I feel too strongly about this to let it go again.
The good news it that I may finally have figured out the ending that the play so desperately needs.  It's not too different from what's there on the paper, but it'll be more engaging and it shouldn't be campy.  I just need to find the time to write it.  I want to be able to publish this before I graduate.  I just need my foot in the door.  That would make it seem like this was actually worthwhile.
Honestly, if Mrs. Pfaff likes it, I don't even know if we can do it.  There are the actors and the other director now... essentially there are a lot of things ready to get right into the face of this project getting out of the water.  But I'm not going to be one of them.
And this resolution goes for more than my supposed carreer.  I'm going to start asking girls out when I see them... well you know what I mean.  I tired of the way things are.  It's got to stop.  I'm going to be uncautious.  I'm just going to try to actualy go on dates with actual girls and then I'll be better with myself...  I hope."

"event","I studied a little bit for it yesterday.  I can only assume that I wasn't too worried as I saw it fit to pretty much only go over my old homework in between parts of Frasier.  I woke up early today so that I could go over some parts with Zeus before the exam.  Thanks to our little study session, I learned where the coronal consonants were, and that he was confused about the same parts where I was confused.  Only about half of that showed up on my test.  
If you really knew your stuff then I would consider the test pretty easy.  It consisted of six big questions where you figure out the rules of the consonants of the syllables of the so on and so on...  I found it pretty easy to fill out the first portions of each question but right at the bottom it got difficult.  It was sort of like running a mile and then being asked what specific muscles I just used to get there.  
""all of them.""
I even left question marks at the end of some of my answers just to make it all the more apparent that I didn't really know what I was talking about.  I honestly felt that I actually knew some of these answers, it's just that the wording was such that I didn't always know what was being asked. But don't worry.  I believe I passed.  Actually I was less optimistic when I left the previous test, and I ended up with a C.  I probably had a B in the class overall before the final.  Another C isn't going to shake anything up.  So I felt pretty darn good as I walked away.  It's strange how being mediocre can sometimes be so satisfying."

"event","I believe I found a bit of solace with my painting class.  During my walk there, I held my painting in such a way as to almost to shelter it from the world.  But over the course of the class I saw my work in a new light.  A few touches here and there, and a number of compliments from my peers and I showcased it all the way back to the apartment.  i must say that it is a bit strange as you walk down the shopping center with a large canvas in your hands.  it's one of those rare instances where such a important piece of you is projected for everyone to see.  All it takes is but one glance to know that I am an artist.  A moderately talented painter with a big canvas and board shorts.  That's me.
I can't help but feel a bit sad that there's so many people I've gotten to know whom I won't likely ever see again.  I've really enjoyed the people in both of my classes, and I feel that I am going to miss them a little bit.  But that's just the way things work around here.  
Now I must say that I was impressed with some of the others student's work. It definitely made me wish that I had pushed myself to finish the painting so that everyone could have seen it in it's completed state.  Jessica's painting was the one that I was most impressed with.  She produced an image of a stairway that was everything you could hope for it to be.  Simply wonderful to put it concisely.  Yet as I watched all of our paintings hang on that wall, their imperfections slowly became more clear... the bird's feet are just too small... that girls head really doesn't look attached to her body... and as for mine, well, I already knew each of it's dark little secrets.
It occurred to me that it just might be that the truly great paintings (like you'd find in a museum) are the ones that become more exceptional as you view them.  The good ones strike you when you first see them, but it may only be fleeting.  I feel that our paintings are much more towards the latter, but that's not something to worry about.  In fact, I'm quite good with it.  I just hope to have it finished and on the wall by the time Laurie comes back.  It'll make a good conversation piece between the pasta and the potatoes."

It doesn't matter much anyway.
I got back to my painting after pretty much ignoring if for a day.  I slapped on some red for the girl's dress and it didn't turn out quite as nice as I would have liked.  I'm not sure precisely what I was looking for in the dress.  Unlike the boy when my painting clearly meandered from my idea, the girl's dress essentially conformed to my vision.  I just hadn't realized that my image of her would prove so unimpressive.  I feel like the more I work on this piece the more it disapoints me.  I ended up e-mailing my art teacher to ask for help tommorow morning before class.  That way I'll hopefully be able to get the girl's face to come out right.  And having that would make me just so much more content with the work overall."

"event","I missed my opportunity with Marleen, and it's likely that it's for gone for good.  Now you should understand that Marleen is simply an attractive and available Egyptian girl who seemed to enjoy talking to me, so it's not like I spent my days writing her name on my book margins.  But all the above mentioned qualities should have been enough to warrant a request for dinner.  Honestly.  I'm uncertain if she was even remotely interested in me, girls never smile intently while I talk... but that's not the point.  The point is that she's just added to the pile of potential girlfriends that I failed to ask out...  I really meant that in a non-disturbing way.  Ah, well... the last thing I want this to be is a series of personal complaints.  So I'm over it."

"event","Somehow I have managed to find myself alone in the apartment.  Laurie is still off enjoying herself in Japan, and more recently Dan has disapeared after some mysterious calls regarding plane flights.  I woke up friday to find a message on the board saying that Megan would be off in lake tahoe until August. I think that this has been the first time in at least a year that I have been here alone.  Oddly enough things didn't feel all that different.
I started the day at around twelve with pancakes and then off to my big painting project.  Today was painting, and very little else.  I had decided that today was the day that I would to finish the picture of the boy I had started.  I was rather happy with how the shirt and shorts had come out, but the rest of him proved a bit problematic.  I can't stress enough how hard it is to get the color of flesh right, and at the end of the day the boy turned out rather black.  It was a good black, a nice tan skin that could easily be found in the real world, but still it was not what I had previously intended. But he's going to stay black.  I've spent too much time now to complain about original intention.  Needless to say the painting has indeed begun to stray from my original vision.  That vision mainly consisting of a well crafted painting.  I feel constantly irked by just how poor that teenager looks in comparison to my concept sketch taped to the same canvas.  Drawing, for me, is a thousand times easier and it seems to show.  Nevertheless I feel that the painting should still be good enough for the wall when it's finished.  I'll just try to stick it up there when no one's looking."

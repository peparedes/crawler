But i recently got laid off from my job at tru-kay.. Bunch of bullshit so im unemployed right now but im getting unemployment.. I baught a new car to.. A 2006 grand prix gxp its a sweet ass ride but without a job i cant really go to far with it.. Im still single.. Its been about 2 years now that me and Amanda broke up and i still havent found another Gf... I feel so pathetic at times.. Since ive been unemployed ive had tons of time to think about my life and i realized how im going no where fast.. Im sad lonely and miserable and everyday it gets worse.. I dont know what to do with myself anymore.. Ever since i graduated from highschool I pretty much lost all contact with my friends.. Its like when you graduate everyone forgets about you... Its messed up.. I always say everything happens for a reason, And i really hope that their was a good reason why i got laid off, and why all this shit has been happening to me.. I just so desperatly want to find a girl to love and that loves me... All I know is that if my life keeps going the way it is now.. I dont know how much longer im gonna last."

"event","in a week im finishing college, that means no more school. Which couldnt possibly be a better thing. That also means im finished with my internship. So im finally going to be able to sleep in :). I also got a new job working at Tru-kay and it pays great so im finally making shit loads of money, and i got out of debt. I was gonna move out but i changed my mind. Im just gonna stay at the house with my family for a little while and save maaaad loot and prolly just buy a house. On the darker side of things, my dad is going back to iraq, sucks balls. Every time he leaves its awkward when he comes back. i dont no how long my family can do this shit."

"event","Been sooo long since i last posted.. Almost forgot all about livejournal

Quit my job yesterday... I didnt want to... I just got so sick and tired with all the bull shit there. Waking up every morning knowing that im not doing what im supposed to do with my life.. I just couldnt handle it any more.. I got no clue what im doing anymore. Im so sick of life, and all its bullshit. 

Im interning at the Cumberland Police station... Odd how that happens. With all the fucked up things ive been doing lately, youd think thats the last place id be working at, The only bright side to my life right now is that im in my last semester of college... but what then? Continue on my lonely path of destruction? In the last year my life has done nothing but fall apart And what do I have to show for it? A broken heart? empty pockets?

Something Big is about to happen to me... Ive been feeling it for the last few days now.. I got no clue whats going to happen.. If its good... If its bad.. Or what im supposed to do when it happens... Maybe im just crazy and desperatly hopeing for something that will never come.

I hate being ignored, I tried so hard to be a good person and i have nothing. Im sick of seing scumbags end up with everything that i so desperatly want. Whats wrong with me? Am i just some kind of joke? It feels like I have absolutly no control over my life anymore.. Maybe its better that way... Id only fuck it up even more...


Oh god, I just wish someone could save me."

Im trying to stay away from my friends as much as possible. They are trying to get me to smoke again, and i cant ruin my life. even tho smoking was the only time that im happy and seem to have a good time. Oh, how i wish i could change my life. And i think im going to."

Mcdonalds hired a bunch of new people that suck at life.. Im so glad im trying to get a new job.  But to do that i had to quit smoking, Which is ok. 

Me and amanda are hanging out again which im so happy about. I love her to death, And when im around her, she makes me feel... special.. I dont no how to describe it. All i no is that when im around her, im not hurting anymore. Thats pretty much the only time where its worth living. But she just wants to be friends i guess. Well.. So i guess im not that special then. 
Its strange.. amanda said that i have like 5 personalities... And ive always thought the same thing about me.. could their be a problem with me?  And thats wat ive been working on since we broke up. I changed myself, only if she knew that. But its prolly to late to save any chance of us getting back together.. If only i could get her to love me again. 

Lets talk about some highlights about my life tho .... well... I got nothing., So i guess this is the end of this entry. So i guess this iss farewell for now. Hopefully next time i update something amazing will have happened."

"event","Not to much has been going on lately and all i can say is that im simply going insane. Inside out it feels like my world is drowning. I dont no wat to do.. Everything seems so fake right now. Everyone, everything.. Just doesnt seem real. Life is so Plain and boring. Everyday seems the same to me. I cant deal with this shit. I need to find something real in my life. Something i can grab onto and never let go. I need to be saved. But noone is here to save me. I hate how whenever Im single everything just falls to drugs and alcohol, I got to be the most pathetic person in the world. But if i dont do it.. then ill really be all alone.. 

Ive been working alot more recently. Going into work earlier so i dont have to be at home. Least at work i feel somewhat alive and needed. I guess thats my problem. Im just not needed. Amanda is gone, Most of my friends are fake, or just to boring to stay in contact with. Noone needs me. And tif im not needed. then wats the point in being here. I so desperatly need to get outa here. 

Do i dare to turn to him one last time? ask for another? when so many times before he gave, but took away? Life is so unfare. 

I dont think this life is meant for me."

"event","Ever since me and amanda broke up ive been trying to figure out who i am and wat i am doing with my life and so far i havent gotten far. Ive been so deeply confused and upset at myself. This is the second time in my life where i have felt so crushed and didnt no wat to do. It feels like im all alone in this world trapt. Since the day we broke up it seems like amanda has had no feelings towards me what so ever.. Like we were never in love in the first place. She doesnt love me.. And it makes me mad because after a year of going out how do u just stop loving someone. I beleive that if u are truely in love, that feeling will never go away. her and felisha. The 2 people i ever loved, Twisted my world, and left me alone. And now once again i find myself in my same patheticness. Drinking and smoking. Every time i do it, I hate it so  much and i never want to do it again.. But i always end up doing it again.. I need so much help but i have noone to help me. I hate this world so much. Why would god give me so much, Make me so happy and contantly take it away. Its a sick game. Nothing ever goes my way. And i always end up hurt and alone in the world. I asked god to give me someone to love me, and for me to love them, He gives it to me. And then takes it away. And i end up more hurt and alone then wat i began at. Most of the time i just feel like giving up on the world. I have absolutly nothing to live for. Noone that loves me. And if i do fall in love again i no it will only be a matter of time untill i get crushed again.

Its funny. I was at work, And i was trying to think wat i got to live for.. And the only thing i could think of was that my dad was fixing my room for me, and i didnt want to let him down. How pathetic. I told myself that i was gonna change and grow up. And i have done this. I can see the world threw new eyes. But where do i stand.. I have nothing. I hate being alone. I hate everything. 

Wats the point in trying when its all gonna get taken away? Sometimes i wish i could go back in time and change everything."

"event","I havent updated this thing in like a million bagillion years. But its ok, just more to right about now.

Im still working at McDonalds, Sadly its the best job ive had... Well.. On most days. New people are constantly getting hired their now so everyones hours are getting shorter and shorter. Which is good tho, I like not working, and it gives me more free time to hang out with amanda, or bye myself :(, 

Ive been saving my money like crazy, Tomarrow my car should be finished getting fixed so tomarrow i can pick it up. HOPEFULLY!. Usually i have really bad luck and i like... never get my car fixed. So im hopeing god gives me a break for once with my birthday being 2 days away and all. I cant wait to be driving it again. When it works its such a beautifull car. But ive hardly been able to drive it since i got it. And when i get it, Im gonna be doing MAJOR shit to it, im gonna make it the bestest looking/racing car you have ever seen.

I just got out of school, I got a 2 week vacation before i have to go back... :( while everyone has like... 2 months off. That hardly gives me any time with amanda. Im pretty sure i passed everything at school. Im just worried about 1 class.. Which i pray to god i passed kuz its so boring.
Im hoping My friend marlene (Ma) calls me over vaca. She is supposed to be having a party over vaca, and was very ify about me going since theirs gonna be Liquor. I told her that i wasnt gonna drink and if anything ill be a designated driver.. Ill be very sad if she has the party and doesnt tell me about it. She is like... My best friend at school. And ive became very good friends with her Bf. His name is Jessie james Presley. lol. How awkwardly funny. I call him SweetBoots.

If my car is fixed im hopefully going to the mall with gabby and grace. 2 members of our trio, Sarah cant go because her mom is a douche. Which is good tho.. hanging out with sarah is very awkward.( i hope im spelling that right) And if amanda and mali have nothing to do at that time, Hopefully They go to. Kuz im bringing everyone! :) i need to show off my car. Noone has seen it cuz it brokeded after i got it. 

Me and amanda just got over a fight. I was wrong with what i did, i admit it, but i was really upset. I hope she can forgive me. Amanda is like.. The nicest most caring person i know. And she deserves the world.. And sometimes.. i feel like i cant give it to her.. I just hope that she is happy with me, and stays with me forever. :) And soon our 1 yr is coming up.. And then her birthday! :) Im hopeing to make both very special for her. Cuz she completly and udderly deserves it.

back to work. Just want to say for the records. Ive made up with everyone i had problems their with. So now im friends with everyone.. Even courtney. I just gotta swallow hard sometimes when she has a bitchy moment. But when u get passed that she is cool. I just closed with her tonight and we talked alot. It was nice. Seems like she is having relationship problems to. And seeing it from a girls point of view, Makes me understand amanda a little bit better. 

Well im beat, I worked long hours today and i might have to wake up early tomarrow.. IFF my car is ready. Today is now friday EARLY morning. and my b-day is sunday

And hopefully i see amanda everyday this weekend.

And the 4rth of july me and amanda are going to her aunts house. :) im really excited. I miss seeing her and Jordan. And i have yet to see her new apartment all set up. 
 
If amanda says its a good idea, then im gonna talk to her aunt and apologize about lying to her.

I LOVE U AMANDA!"

"event","It is better to love and have lost... then to never have loved at all. or.. something like that..
These words seem to echo threw the back of my mind.

Like so many times before, I will start by saying this, Its been a while since my last update, And well.. Lots of stuff to write about.  Well the whole car thing... We have a court date on may.. 11th?.. i think.. Something like that. Still kinda upset about the whole thing,... But i still love the car., Its nice. I got alot of great plans for it.

Mcdonalds... Is good. Ive made alot of great friends. Their all really coool. Just about everyone their is just awsome. Like taressa. She's like.. 40 something years old. lol. The only old person their. But she is so great and funny. She was the first friend inside mcdonalds that i made. I call her ""Ma"" kuz well.. i donnol.. I just do, And its alot easier to call her that then to remember her namee... For christ sakes.. it just took me like 2 minutes to remember her name to right it down. Besides tabatha theirs. Glenn, Marcus, Dave, Chucky, Billy, Jeff, Karen, Zina (black older lady manager.. Always has to have that one black person lol), Kate, Courtney (She is such a fucking cunt sometimes tho... Just gets on my nerves... If anything.. she would be the reason i quit or get fired) Then theirs... Sara... And.. Thats all i can think about so far. Well.. For my friends that is. And theirs still alot of other people that i havent met or bothered talking to yet. Or their just all Fag Bags.. Like Ray. lol. Such a fucking Douche.

But anyways. Ive been working alot.. 7-12:30 or even till 1:00 in the morning.. And it sucks. Kuz i dont fall asleep till like 2.. And i gotta get up At 6:30 for school.. I got like.. Ansomnia.. Or however u spell it. So after school... I usually sleep till 5 when i dont see amanda... Kind of pathetic my life is.. Just school and work.. And ive been way to tired during school.. I keep falling asleep. It sucks ass, I just hope my grades dont drop because of it.  Working their Is alright i guess.. Depends who u work with.. I like working with Glenn, dave, ""Ma"", Chucky and Karen. We usually just goof around have fun and eat FREEEE food. And it helps make the time go bye. but enough about work... It seems to be the only thing my life is about right now... EWW..

P.S on the work thing. My uncle Tom FINALY got in contact with me and my bro about working for him.. I could go part time making $8.50 starting. At McD's I get $7.. So thats a big raise... But... Its alot farher away, so gas will be used more (AND GAS PRICES ARE RISING... AND STILL RISING!). Id get less hours.. Id be getting like 3 days a week 4 hours per day.. And the hours would be 4-8.. So that would mean i wouldnt beable to see amanda on those days.. So id be making more money, but get less hours and id be wasting more money getting to the damn place... Kuz its alot farther then mcd's

Talking about distance.. In 2-3 weeks, My family is finally moving into our own house!. And i got a basement apartment thing with its own bathroom!.. But the washer and Dryer is downstairs so my parents will be down their alot doing laundry, but we all have started arranging ""A SySTEM"" Untill we fix the downstairs to make an extra hallway to cut it off from my apartment thing. So I will have complete privacy. And I have my own door leading out so i can sneak out easier to go get amanda and go to school without having to go up the stairs of doom. So, Im really excited about moving. But i will miss the village.

The village has been my home for about 9 years now. Its full of happy and sad memories. But as time moved on, Alot of friends have came and gone. Used to hang out with vance and Ashley with glenn everyday for years.. but then vance and ashley moved out. And so the village just mainly consisted of me glenn and marcus for the last couple of years. But no i guess its our time to leave.. I no i will shed tears when we leave.. But we arent going to far. Ill still see glenn and marcus at work.. and whenever we want to hang out. 

Hopefully cool people take my house when i move.. Give me glenn and marcus some more people to hang out with.

Now my section on amanda, The part ive been trying to get to.. So if u dont want to hear me babble about My relationship.. Stop reading now....:BEEP:

ewww Its 1:46 A.M right now.. Gotta get up for school soon lol. But i never have time to update anymore.

Our relationship i suppose, Has been very off.. I dont no Who's fault it is exactly.. or wat is to blaim.. Well.. I guess it is kind of my fault.. But its something That I have hadly any control over.. For the last 3 years I have been victemized and Scared from my last 2 ""relationships"" 

Just keep in mind.. When someone is victemized, The fear stays with them forever. Example.. U get jumped by a group of Black kids.. Then everytime ur out alone.. or everytime u see A group of black kids... U will be scared shitless... well... Thats kind of how i am with relationships right now.. Scared shitless.

Felisha isnt the only one that had caused me this problem.. Threw felisha, I had found out that.. Anything can  happen in a relationship... One minute u Think u will be with the person forever.. Then the next minute THEIR SCREWING AROUND WITH UR BEST FRIEND (PETE.. COUGH). Felisha... Pretty much scared me for life.. Ive never had someone so close to me hurt me so much.. All around me ive seen relationships with people cheating on their partners.. I just never thought i would happen to me.. Well.. As long as i stayed true.. But how wrong could i have been.. I just dont understand it... Pete.. The one and only friend i had that i thought would be their forever.. and always have my back... He always spoke of how honest he was... and how loyal he is.. but even after this happened.. I just saw how he was fucking everyone from behind.. and How he was stealing or trying to steal everyone away from me.. I experimented with torie.. and i was correct... Anyways. From him i learned that friends cant be fully trusted.. If u mix best friends and g/f's to much... Only bad will happen..
Other then that.. Before chuck and chantel went out.. me and Chantel was kind of ""involved""... And we were about to go out.. When we fucked around with my brother IN MY BED!.. when i was at work.. The day i was thinking about asking her out!... And my brother new it to!. Well.. Chantel actually didnt mean anything to me... I was just kind of lost after felisha.. And needed something to do.. But I learned that Family cant even be trusted... I cant trust my brother around my G/f's.. I cant trust my friends around my G/f's... It just seems like theirs noone to trust..  IM TERRIFIED OF LOSING AMANDA!.. Thats the cold honest fact.. Theirs so many people out their that can take her away from me and it terrifies me.. Thats the truth.. 

Amanda... Ive been Victemized.. Scared.. Broken.. I admit.. I have really bad trust issues... But u will never know how i feel.. Or what it feels like to go threw wat i did... But Im trying so hard! Me and u have been going out for about 8 months now.. And i still havent gotten over it.. I dont no if i ever will. But Wats so wrong about caring?.. I mean in every relationship theirs that feeling of wat if ur partner isnt being loyal... Or nervousness and jelousy when your partner is around the opposite sex.. U say that u dont have it.. But U do. Everyone does.. But not everyone really knows wat it feels like when it really happens.. Im just one of them  unlucky people who had found out the hard way on how relationships can turn bad.. Amanda. I will always be very uneasy when u are around guys.. And u will secretly be uneasy when im around girls.

I love u to death amanda. I want to be with u forever. But if u cant deal with the fact on how i feel towards the whole guy thing.... Then We should just break up now.. Save time for us both.. I desperatly dont want to break up.. I am willing to keep trying... Well.. Try to stop sounding like an ass to u, when u talk about hanging out with ur friends and their being a guy their..  Its not that I dont trust u amanda.... I do have trust for u.. But if ur out with a guy.. just u and him.. It would kill me.. Just thinking about it.. hurts.. The past will always haunt me.. It will hurt.. But i will try to swallow hard.. And Well.. Deal with it.. But just like i said.. I dont want it to be like.. U and him alone in a house.. That I dont trust.. 

Amanda.. I want it to be me and u together.. Forever.. But also our friends to.. I want us to beable to hang out together alone. Together along with friends. Or just Alone with friends... But Being in a relationship, just keep in mind their are boundries.

I just hope that our relationship works amanda. I care about u so much.. I think about u all the time.. I mean.. I do got some issues.. And im thinking about maybe going back to a phycologist.. Maybe that will help me a little.. I am willing to do anything for u and our relationship.. U mean the world to me.. Honestly amanda.. Sometimes u say that i dont appreciate u.. But the truth is.. From the second i wake up till the second i fall asleep. I am feeling So greatfull that we are together. I just wish u knew how i felt about u.. Without u, i feel like im lost. Amanda, U name it.. And ill get it.. Or  give it to u.

Anyway... On the last note before i get to bed... because its 2:14 how..

It kinda feels like my life has been on hold for a while.. I havent written any poems in a while.. I know.. UR thinking ""oh wow.. Poems.. Yippy"" But My writting means alot to me.. Gives me a chance to let my feelings out, instead of dwelling on them, and bottleing them in. U may not beleive it but I bet if i start writting again me and amanda will do a little bit better.

      Well. Good night.. Tomarrow is another fun day of school and Work.. :Sigh: But im seeing amanda tomarrow... And then Thursday i dont have work so thats nice... Maybe me and amanda will have a good day tomarrow...

Well... She is going out with Mali tomarrow morning.. Makes me nervous when we goes to prov.. Its dangerous and everyone their are pretty much all assholes. :Sigh:... I also have problems with worrying. 

U no.. Every time i bring amanda home.. Im always thinking.. Wat if something happens to her on the way up the stairs.. Or :( if someone is hiding in the hallway.. To kidnap or hurt her :(.. I always think about calling her like.. right then and their.. 2 seconds after i drop her off.. But i know that Im just way to pathetic.. Ive always worried way to much.. And it always seems to get the better of me.. Makes me worried.. Makes me scared.. Which makes me unhappy... :( but then amanda calls me.. Or i get home and talk to her online.. Then i feel so much better!

Well. Amanda is my world so good night"

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33ff33>Well im still going out with felisha, Its going on 8 months. And we are engaged. Im happy about it. But i.... Its wierd to explain.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33ff33>&nbsp; Felisha is always telling me that im not acting like the old jonsterz that i once was, and its tormenting me, I so desperatly wanna be like i once was. The jonsterz that she fell in love with, The jonsterz who always smiled no matter how much he was hurting. Do u wanna no my secrete on how i was such a great fun person.... Its vcalled having the best supportive friends. My bestest friend PETE, ALEX, And Eskamoo AMANDA. They were always their for me and it made me soo incredibly happy. But since me and Felisha started going out she doesnt like me hanging out with alex or amanda no more, And it pisses me off. I mean. The only reason she doesnt want me to hang out with them is because she thinks i will cheat on her or something. She thinks im like all the other guys out their, but believe me... im not. I try to be the most honest kind hearted person, who tries to never hurt or back stab. And i think ive done a good job of it.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33ff33>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a confession. Felisha doesnt like Alex because I USED TO have a crush on her. When i first met her. It was like 10-11 months ago, But it ended when She and My other good friend Glenn whent out. Then the feelings i had for her ended and we just became great friends, And thats all i ever wanted from any of them. A solid friend ship. Nothing mad me happier then to go to the mall and Have people actually excited to see me. Thats y im so happy to be friends with Pete, Amanda, and Alex. Because they are Actually my friends.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33ff33>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I dont see how felisha is jelouse of me wanting to hang out or talk to alex. While felisha is doing all the things she tells me not to do. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33ff33>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex is&nbsp; going out with this kid kyle. And i was really sketchy at first of him becuase i didnt no him. Im just gonna clearify this now.

I have met kyle and i think he is really kool.. Im really happy for Alex and Kyle. I really wanna hang out with them, Me felisha, Alex and kyle.

"event","Well, Here i am again. A new year of school. Its been a while since i last updated, Im sorry, Ive been kinda buisy.

Well im still going out with felisha, Its going on 8 months. And we are engaged. Im happy about it. But i.... Its wierd to explain.

  Felisha is always telling me that im not acting like the old jonsterz that i once was, and its tormenting me, I so desperatly wanna be like i once was. The jonsterz that she fell in love with, The jonsterz who always smiled no matter how much he was hurting. Do u wanna no my secrete on how i was such a great fun person.... Its vcalled having the best supportive friends. My bestest friend PETE, ALEX, And Eskamoo AMANDA. They were always their for me and it made me soo incredibly happy. But since me and Felisha started going out she doesnt like me hanging out with alex or amanda no more, And it pisses me off. I mean. The only reason she doesnt want me to hang out with them is because she thinks i will cheat on her or something. She thinks im like all the other guys out their, but believe me... im not. I try to be the most honest kind hearted person, who tries to never hurt or back stab. And i think ive done a good job of it.

    I got a confession. Felisha doesnt like Alex because I USED TO have a crush on her. When i first met her. It was like 10-11 months ago, But it ended when She and My other good friend Glenn whent out. Then the feelings i had for her ended and we just became great friends, And thats all i ever wanted from any of them. A solid friend ship. Nothing mad me happier then to go to the mall and Have people actually excited to see me. Thats y im so happy to be friends with Pete, Amanda, and Alex. Because they are Actually my friends.

    I mean, I dont see how felisha is jelouse of me wanting to hang out or talk to alex. While felisha is doing all the things she tells me not to do. 

    Alex is  going out with this kid kyle. And i was really sketchy at first of him becuase i didnt no him. Im just gonna clearify this now. I think of Alex as.... Well kinda like a sister. I just wanna see her with a good kid. Alex is a great person and i just wanted to make sure she was in good hands. I have met kyle and i think he is really kool.. Im really happy for Alex and Kyle. I really wanna hang out with them, Me felisha, Alex and kyle. But i doubt that will ever happen.

I promise this, I will bring back the old Jonsterz at any cost. I mean, If Felisha fell in love with me while i was the ""Jonsterz"" why is she trying to change my life. ITs either u love me for me or u dont. Its that simple.

Kuz no matter wat. Im not going to lose my friend ships with Alex Eskamoo or Pete, They were my friends before i met felisha, And damn well they will be my friends After.

I love u felisha,  I love u Pete
And to my good 2 friends Eskamoo and Alex."

"event","Well today is thursday, Woopie!. And tomarrow is friday. I get to see my Darling Felisha, And im pretty sure we are going to the mall. We havent been to the mall in a while and ive been wanting to go. I miss some of my mall friends. And well, I just wanna get out and do something. I just hope tomarrow night goes by smoothly. 
Itll be nice spending some time with glenn and pete. I havent spent much time with them with me being sick, Its been icky. And maybe ill see Eskamoo and Kinksterz at the mall to, And Liz and Purple and all them fun people. Lifes been kinda hard for me, but i no its gonna be better as long as i keep my head high. Being sick had really put me down, I tried not to let it get to me, but it did. Oh wells. I still got Felisha, and my friends. I really miss Felisha, and  Pete. I dont no whats happening with me and Pete. Him and Glenn have been hanging out with the young'uns of the village and its wierd. Like i dont no why glenn and Pete just suddenly started being friends with the girls and stuff. I got no clue if their planning on going out with them or what. I just no that its making it harder for me to spend time with Pete. Not to mention I think Glenn and Pete are seperating a little. Glenn has been ditching pete alot recently and well, I think it makes Pete more upset then he acts. But Pete is still my bestest Friend and I love'ems for it. 
Well untill next time, Later people

I love u Felisha, Soo very much
I love my son Pete"

"event","Well its been a while since i last updated my journal. Ive just been kinda buisy. 


Well any ways...

For the last 2 weeks ive been sick, I have Mono, Really sucks but i got to miss 8 days of school. So it was pretty fun. But being sick was kinda icky, For the fist 4 days I couldnt sleep at all, I was getting very frustrated and upset, THEN!! the docters decided to give me medicine, And it helped me sleep. Which was a good thing. While I was sick I got to see my baby, Felisha alot, It was sooo wonderfulls, Except I wasnt allowed to kiss her because I could get her sick. Having mono suckes soo badly tho, Every one treats u like ur diseased and everyone kept telling me i Cant do this, i cant do that. I HATE IT!. I hate being told i cant do something. All I wanted was to be with felisha and be left alone. My dad also came back home, He left for 2 weeks because of A National Guards thing, Felisha came with me and my mom to pick him up. It was soo nice of her. It was at like 12 at night to. So we were both exhausted. It was soo funny tho because me and my aunt was goofing around making a scene and had everyone around us laughing. Its June 8, School is almost at end, and summer will soon take place, This summer is gonna change my life. Im gonna be 17, Have my licence. And well Me and Felisha are going a long way and its great. I love her soo incredibly much. Well Thats it for now. Sooo. Yeah. By people


I love my felisha,
I love my Son Pete"

"event","well yesterday is friday... I came home and found out felisha is sleeping over her best friend jackii's house.. Which is a good thing kuz they never hang out after school. But i miss her sooooo incredibly much. Me Glenn and Pete whent to the mall. We all walked around for a bit. Saw a few people.. THEN FELISHA SHOWED UP. I was soooo happy and filled with joy. But then She ran off with Jackii to do their thing. So i was kinda upset and sad again. But its nice to see felisha running around with her friends being happy. Uhh. We found Josh.. So glenn and josh did their ""thing"" while me and pete just kinda stood around waiting for them.. I think pete is as pissed at them as i am, ha. Felisha came back and I hung with her for a little bi because i just missed her soo much and if i didnt spend some time with her i would have died or something terrible. Then she told me to go play with my friends and she whent off again... so i was alone again, so me and pete just hung out some more. Soon it was time to go and i couldnt find felisha to say good bye.. I left sad.. That was the worst mall night ever.

Uhh. Now its saterday and pretty early. I didnt sleep well.. Grr. Felisha is still at jackii's and from wat i no. She is gonna hang with jackii again today so i prolly wont beable to see her.. I think im gonna cry. If felisha ever left for more than 2 days. i dont no how i would make it. Well. If felisha doesnt come down today... then my day just sucks now doesnt it.. but hey. Its all good. If im with my 2nd fav. person Pete than its all good. Well im going now. Im gonna try to salvage my day.. Grr (tear)"

"event","<P><FONT color=#00cccc>Well. Life above all, is slowly moving. I got my contacts..Finally... I found my Korn hat and i got me a new kool hat as well. Lately, Ive been seeing Felisha alot and hanging out with pete and glenn, so its been really fun. Since i got my contacts ive noticed ive been acting differantly... Like i got more confidence... Well thats how felisha said it, But I just feel so much more free without glasses and i feel like i can get so much closer to her. And most importantly I look, feel and act better than i used to. Its kinda dumb but, I think getting contacts is gonna make me be more of the person felisha wants to be like. Since i got them, Me and felisha seem to be enjoying our selves more, and i feel more like a part of the guys.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00cccc>Hmm, Friday, Felisha, Pete, Glenn, Me and Paul whent to the mall, We had a good time, Well it was uhh ok. I saw Alex and kyle... They werent supposed to be here this friday but it was good to see some familiar faces. Alex and Kyle have been going out for a long time and its good to see that Alex has found a good guy. Im just sorry i was kind of an ass hole to kyle at the beggining. And uhh, Felisha was upset that i was all excited and happy to see alex. But I understands. and im sorry. I love u so much Felisha. uhh, Well, after that, We ran into manda, She thinks that me and felisha hated her... And well, we didnt but i am kinda upset about the hole thing she did. (kind of a long story). Well that was the night. Then saterday rolled around AND I COULDNT SEE FELISHA!!! (Cries)!! I was sooooooo upset. Well today is sunday. I spent my day with felisha.

"event","Someone asked me... At what point in ur life, was ur happiest? I thought long and hard.. I didnt have an answer. That question has hounted me but now i no.

Back when i was about 6, me and my brother was as close as can be. I still remember, Everyday We hung out together and played with G.I Joes, And even beastwars. So much fun we had. Chuck even read books to me.. I remember, Back then when i couldnt read good ha, One day, I was sick, and i was really upset my brother came into the room and sat next to me. He said. Do u want me to read to u. I said sure. So we sat their and he read a goosebumps book to me. I still remember the book. Beware of bat winged hall. It meant so much to me. I loved him so much.

It was a little after that... He grew up

I whent up to him, with my bag full of toys and asked him if he wanted to play with some toys with me.. He said no. and called me a loser. I was so confused

I guess. I just wasnt good enough for him anymore

after that, Chuck changed so much, and left me behind. Thats when he got into music and all that. I just sat back in the shadows and wondered wat was happening to him

He changed so much

After this is when he just became so mean to me. He started to pick on me daily. the brother who once took an hour out of his day to play with toys with me, just because noone else would.

I remember when we were little how, we would sneak into eachothers rooms and just talk to eachother untill we fell asleep. Or on holiday mornings we would be up like 3 hours before my parent woke up. We walked on the house wigging out because we could sleep, We were to excited.

But this was the old chuck.

The new one... Is just.. Differant

My phyco docter, asked me why, all the problems i talked about,, revolved around chuck.. I didnt no

But i guess its because, Chuck used to be my... God. He did everything for me, When noone else could or would. Were we lived it was just our family and our cousins.
But now, He is so far away from me and left me behind in his life.

I guess. Im just lost.

I try to be as good of a brother as i can. But.. i guess its just.. A lost cause. our brotherhood.. Slipped threw my fingers and i couldnt save it.. It took 7 years. And i suppose we are almost ok again. but.. I cant explain it. Grr
He used to be all i had.. I actually looked up to him, But hey, It happens. Threw all my life, At least now i got the girl i loved, A few great friends and a good amount of friends. but.. still. I wish me and my brother were like we used to be... 

   Like best friends.

But i suppose, ill never stop trying to save it

      I love ya bro. In a brotherly way
       I love you felisha. My one and only 
        I love my best buds glenn, pete"

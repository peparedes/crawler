"event","Once I managed to shield my eyes from the glare, it seemed to be a letter from Serra, concerning a costume party she's holding in Kathlet in a few weeks. The theme is ""Famous Lovers"". I think. I'm not sure entirely sure what letters the distorted hearts were supposed to represent, if they were meant to be letters at all. I suppose I should attend, since it IS a celebration of Nergal's defeat. (I think. I really want to know what those hearts were supposed to be.)

In more immediate news, Lady Lyndis has returned to Lycia! The castle's in an uproar, so logically that stress headache should be persisting, but it's completely gone. So is that annoying involuntary twitch above my eye. Perhaps they're only produced by double-related stress. <font size=""1"">More likely, it's Lady Lyndis' presence.</font> I wonder if she'll want to resume control of Caelin? I'd be glad to serve as her Knight Commander again. That's between her and Lord Hector still, though, and I'm not even sure if she's back for good or only visiting. <s>I hope it's for good.</s>"

"event","I have a... double? imposter? clone? Something of the sort. If you see someone who looks like me running around and screaming about ""duty"", it's NOT ME. I swear. *panicky* I'm not that obsessive about the subject. <font size=""1"">(Am I? I hope not.)</font> It's raised some questions, though, and even some answers. If I have a double, might the oddly-acting members of this journal list also be doubles? It would explain a great deal. It would also mean that the Sain who's been pro- ah, acting oddly isn't the Sain I know. *hopeful* I really thought better of my friend than THAT.

On a less stressful subject, I need to find some time to work with the young knights-in-training - our current instructor is good, but he can use the help. I often wish Wallace had returned to Caelin, as he said he would. I hope it's merely because he found something more to his liking, and not because something has happened to him.... In any case, I enjoy working with the older students, and a few of them seem quite promising. Legault, you're a guest and I'm not trying to ask anything of you, but if you'd like to drop in on the training once or twice, I'm sure they could learn something from you.

Some sort of muscle twitch seems to be developing above my right eye, and I can't get it to stop. I also have a horrible headache. My double's shouting is rather... piercing. *sighs*

[edit]
Erk appears to have a double as well. While I don't mean to wish my headaches upon you, Erk, I must say I'm relieved to find that I'm not alone in this.

Now, I need to go find some willowbark tea.

"event","I wasn't alone from the start, apparently, although I only now noticed <lj user=""hurricane_fang"">. And not only are more members of Eliwood's army here, Sain is among them. Unfortunately... he's acting quite oddly. I wonder whether he's ill. A few of the others I've seen are not behaving quite as I recall them, and Legault has mentioned seeing another member of Eliwood's army acting strangely as well. It lends credence to the possibility that it's an illness, or perhaps a spell. Has anyone else noticed this, in someone I might have missed?

Still, it's pleasant to see so many old faces, as I haven't seen or spoken to most of Eliwood's army since we defeated Nergal. Sain has visited frequently, Wil of course leads our archer division, and I've seen Lord Hector a time or two when summoned to Ostia on business, but I've missed the others. Especially Lady Lyndis. I hope she's safe and happy in Sacae right now."

"event","I do hope that others I know show up on this ""Livejournal"" affair, though. I must admit I am a bit uncomfortable about being one person along among countless strangers. Perhaps Sain will join; this is his fault, after all. (I must admit that the blame falls on him only in part, however, and quite indirectly. A passing comment he made the last time we talked. I doubt he himself recalls it.)

To go into my personal life, though, as this seems intended to do, I must mention that Arden threw a shoe this morning, forestalling my planned visit to the outlying villages. I spent three hours at a small hamlet near the incident, instead, holding an impromptu session of court for the villagers while their blacksmith re-shod my horse. I was... surprised to see how eagerly they recieved me, though they did not have any important cases to be judged. Then again, they may not have seemed important to me, but I'm sure they were important to the villagers involved. Every day, I learn more about my duties.

From the sounds coming in through the window, somebody has found a copy of General Wallace's ""Manual of Knightly Prowess"" and is reading it aloud to the young knights-in-training. Whether it's a threat or punishment, I'm not sure, but I'd best find out who has it and conceal it, or the squires may very well revolt. Although it certainly brings back memories...."

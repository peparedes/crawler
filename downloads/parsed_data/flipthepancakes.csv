"event","Gummie bears are the most awesome candy in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE! 1. all of them are named fred, no matter what color they are 2. if you put them in water over night, they become SWOLLEN GUMMIE BEARS! and 3. they are uber YUMMY!

We definitely had an AWESOME day in Seeconk (or should i say seecock) with the sun beating down on us hard, and the blue track making us more thirsty than we should have been...it was some good times.  We had to go through RI to get to Seeconk, MA? how retarded...neways, on the way, kristen drank SO much coffee that she had to go to the bathroom wicked bad, we had to stop at mcdonalds for her to go. On the way home it was the most fun! First Alex was all like wouldn't it suck if the bus broke down on our way home (not to mention its like a 2 hour bus ride home) then about 20 minutes from home, we get a flat tire, that seemed more like an exploded tire! It was frickin hillarious, especially cuz Howie (our bus driver) continued driving with the flat for another 5 milesish, and totally killed the front right wheel! It was awesome lemme tell you. Then we had to wait for another bus to come and get us, and my parents were behind the bus, saw that we had a flat, and just kept driving home...what great parents huh! 

Once we got back, we had an awesome time, swimming in our track stuff, we just ran right into the ocean, everyone staring and all! Then Adam tried to teach me how to throw a frisbee, that didn't go off to well...

Then tonight, there was a bonfire at devereaux it was awesome! everyone was there it was this massive party of roasting marshmellows and skinny dipping! so much fun...and if you werent there, u missed out BIG!"

Neways, on a happier note only 37 more days until school gets out! (THATS RIGHT THIRTY SEVEN) 

Sometimes people are heartless.  They really really do not understand that their actions actually affect other peoples' lives.  Also people don't realize the value of friendship.  A friendship can be tainted with the drop of a pin...a lie...a comment...an unthoughtful gesture...a promise not kept.  Promises are a key part of life.  When you promise something to someone, all i know is that you better fucking plan to keep it.  Or if you don't, you better have a damn good excuse as to why you're not keeping your word.  Try not to be heartless.  Try not to be too competitive.  Try not to replace other people.  Try not to take away the little joy that people find from things they love to do.  Keep your promises.  Put your friends before your boy/girlfriends.  Keep your eyes open to people you may be hurting.  Keep an open mind.  Keep in mind the cardinal rules (you all know what i'm talking about.)  Just try and be a sensitive, humane person and everyone will be fine.  

HOWEVER. if you so choose to inflict pain upon others, well then i don't have anything to say to you.  The world does in no means revolve around you nor would it care much if it lost a person like you who doesn't give a flying fuck about anyone else. (the truth hurts doesn't it).  

some people are disgusting me right now.  they don't know who they are because that's not my style.  i'm the non-confrontational type.  but if you think it might be you....then shape up buddy. that's all i have to say.  and maybe you should think before you act every once in a while.  You've hurt a lot of people whose feelings could have been spared had you stopped to think for  5 seconds about what you were doing.  

I don't care if you think this is harsh.  Some people need a wakeup call, they need to wake up and smell the coffee.  And i'm going to be the one to give it to them.  

Thats all folks!"

"event","i got really sunburned yesterday. well not really i think my face looks like lobster-red, but my shoulders and back are more like just a reddish-tan.  PLUS i have a sports bra tan, which makes the situation 34 times better. 

alex's mom made BAKED PASTA for our track team dinner, it was AMAZING! (sorry guys, more of a new jersey thing i guess)

Why It's good to be a woman: 

1. We got off the Titanic first. 
2. We can scare male bosses with the mysterious gynecological disorder excuses. 
3. Taxis stop for us. 
4. We don't look like a frog in a blender when dancing. 
5. No fashion faux pas we make could ever rival the Speedo. 
6. We don't have to pass gas to amuse ourselves. 
7. If we forget to shave, no one has to know. 
8. We can congratulate our teammate without ever touching her rear end. 
9. We never have to reach down every so often to make sure our privates are still there. 
10. We have the ability to dress ourselves. 
11. We can talk to the opposite sex without having to picture them naked. 
12. If we marry someone 20 years younger, we are aware that we will look like an idiot. 
13. We will never regret piercing our ears. 
14. There are times when CHOCOLATE really can solve all our problems.
15. We can make comments about how silly men are in their presence because they aren't listening anyway.

and when i said chocolate really can solve all our problems, i meant it! it really has this week!"

"event","Beware: This journal entry is actually meaningful to me- so dont' just read to read. 

I have realized that I don't have any friends. No, your right I guess everyone has to have friends so I must have some- yet I don't have any true close friends. Ever since elementary school ended I have always been the neutral person. The kid who doesn't really belong to any group and just floats around. Everybody seems to have their own little ""clicks"" and I never have. I have friends here and there yet I'm always the odd one out of the group. 

I've kept my mouth shut for a long time about this cause i figure- you might as well worry about world hunger and peace, but what's better than a bunch of friends you can always turn to- and always do stuff with? So for any of you out there that need a friend- your def. not alone. 

Neways, on brighter side of things, i'm listening to music, and its just putting me into a terrific mood. I'm just kind of bopping around and in a really pleasant mood. Not thinking about the whole friends shit. 

AND i went swimming, in the freezing cold massachusettes water, stripped and just dove right in, it was uber fun!"

"event","Hey, its me again...

I would just like to say a few things.  I hate hate hate all the drama that comes along with life.  I mean it's ridiculous.  Look outside your window right now.  If you don't live in a city, then most likely, you see nature.  observe how peaceful it is.  If only our lives were as simple as this.  but no they're not..we choose to make them hard on ourselves by doing stupid things (especially me) and creating obstacles for ourselves to overcome rather than just sitting back, relaxing, and enjoying the simple things in life and allowing our lives to run on course, peacefully and fluidly.  Imagine that life is a line. We disrupt the calm way that life should be and make it so that instead of having it be homeostatic and good, we created these big dips in it where our lives are just all over the place. This is where the line analogy comes in...you know when you were little and you used to see if you could draw a straight line while you were driving in the car over bumps in the road? well imagine yourself doing that now.  driving along, over a generally smoothely paved road and when you hit a tiny bump in the road, rather than trying to keep the line going straight, you jerk the pen up and make almost a 90 degree angle.  That isn't what is supposed to happen.  It's supposed to have a tiny bump in the line, but still be pretty much straight.  I have been exaggerating the bumps like that too much lately and i need to stop and try and keep drawing the line straight.  It will make my life a lot more easy and fun to live.  I mean on occcasion i blow things out of proportion (i'm not going to mention any specific examples but i think you can most likely guess what i'm talking about if you've been around me the past few days) and when i do this, i just make other people feel bad/ stupid.  I want to take this time to apologize to anyone and everyone who i did that to whenever in my life.  It was a stupid move on my behalf and i'm sorry i put you through that unnecessary pain. 

So with that i'm going to say  SORRRRY 

to anyone who i have ever hurt.  Whatever i did to you i'm sure it was something stupid that i did without thinking.  

I love you so much. and don't you forget it."

1. im running on lack of sleep, so most of this is probably just going to be babble...

2. PROM--what a great time. i had so much fun on friday/saturday morning! 

3. saturday, had track at 7am! not the greatest way to spend the day after prom night without getting any sleep at all!

4. happy birthday liNdz haha i didnt forget the N like timmy! We (timmy and i) made a macaroni birthday card for lindz and he forgot the n in her name, and because we were both running on no sleep, it was incredibly funny.

5. we went to richdales to get some wonderful red bulls (most awesome energy drink in this universe) and we get into timmy's car, are estatic while drinking them, goes to turn on his car, and his battery is dead...then yea we got some help.

6. i'd have to say chappelle show is the BEST show ever! its UBER funny and makes me laugh! and we watched some of the first season at evans house saturday night.

7. i cant believe it but i fell asleep during the CHAPPELLE SHOW at evans, im such a poo head, who falls asleep during the chappelle show? well i needed sleep so i guess i had an excuse...

8. woke up at 3 today! thats a lot of hours of sleep hmmm lets see went to bed at 11:30 woke up at 3...shit thats almost 16 hours of fuckin sleep! woah...

9. then whitty and nate talked me into buying them food from mcdonalds...they changed the fucking value meal numbers around, and RAISED the prices...fuck them!

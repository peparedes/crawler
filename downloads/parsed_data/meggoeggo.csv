Afterward, he walked toward the exit, stopped, pulled down his pants and laid a log right right on the court room floor, and said ""Now that's real ultimate power."" Then he ran.</i></center>

"event","Man, so I finally did my karate test.

I was SO fucking nervous, right before the test.  I honestly, didnt think I could do it.  Someone even told me, that if I needed to take a quick break during the test, just to calm my self down, that they would let me.  I didnt need it though.  

But after I had done everything, I had to go and sit upstairs.  Usually, you just have to go and be there for like, 10 minutes.  I was there for 20 FUCKING minutes.  God, do you know how fucking nerve racking that is?  I was sitting there, and I actually started to hear them laughing.  And while you're second guessing everything you did, thats NOT a good thing.  It turns out, that I had learned a technique wrong, and they were amazed that I ended up in the spot you were supposed to be in, but meh.  :D  So I totally passed.  And evidently, everyone there said such nice things about me, which makes me totally happy.  And now I dont have to test for at least a year or so- thank god.

I had my birthday party as well, which was fun!  True, the music they played sucked major balls, and yes, the highest I bowled was like, a 60 but still!   Katrina got me this AWSOME bag, that Im totally going to use, once I find glue to glue everything to the bag.  Ill have to take pictures just so you can all bask in the awsomeness that is my bag.  :D  Jenny got me a sword and an eye patch, which I love dearly.  Ill just need to find something to wear it with!  xD

I got too much sun today, so please excuse the major spelling errors.  Just, FYI."

So, I babysat for these kids for 3 days.  Ive babysat for them before, and it was $8 an hour.  This time, for the 23 hours I worked, I get payed $5 an hour.  Thats fucking $2 less than minimum wage!  Im assuming its because the company he works for (along with my parents) hasnt been having good business lately, and everyone is getting a MAJOR pay cut.  :(  But oh well.  Ive made about $500 from babysitting so far this summer, so Im not complaining.    Too much.  :D"

But I also saw The Island.  Best.FUCKING.movie.EVER.  God, I loved it.  It was shot really well, which was suprising, since there was so much action in it.  But, god, awsome movie.  And Ewan McGregor looked pretty good in their! God, I can be such a fan girl at times. But, during the previews, there was one that had Cillian Murphy (bad dude from Batman) in it, and it looks so FUCKING awsome!  Its like, this person is taking a red eye to her home, and it gets delayed.  So she goes to the bar, and meets Cillian Murphy.  Well, they're talking and their plane is ready to leave.  Turns out their sitting next to each other, and he has kidinapped her father.  Bah!  Looks excellent!"

"event","So, Kathryn and I went on the boat today.  While on it, we had a discussion on how to know if you're a true Seattlelite.  The list (or at least, what I remember it being)-
1) You can taste the difference between Starbucks, Tully's, and Seattle's Best.  (Seattle's Best is a lot stronger, and Tully's is a bit more creamier.  And at Starbucks, majority of every drink you get there has a coffee aftertaste.  Or at least, thats how it is for me.)
2) You know what it means when people say ""The Mountain is out.""  I myself use this saying nearly all the time when applicable.
3) You dont wear sunglasses.  If you do, you're a fucking tourist.
4) You dont use an umbrella.  If you do, you're a fucking tourist.
5) When trick-or-treating when younger, you're costume was always made to go over a rain coat, as Halloween is right in the rainy season.  :(

There where more, but as I am a whore, I forgot them.

Kathryn and I went out on my boat today, and one of our discussions was about how to know if you are a Seattle-lite.  The obvious one was, of course, knowing what it means when people say that ""The Mountain is out."" And that you can taste the difference between Starbucks, Tully's, and Seattle's Best.  (Very easily done).  You also never wear sunglasses or use umberella's, unless you're a wimp or a tourist.  And when you go out trick-or-treating, you design your costume to go over a coat.  We had other things as well, but those are the one's I remember.  And that the main singer from the Bravery is cute.   The end."

Because, honestly?  3 weeks is a hell of a long time to not do anything but babysit and do karate.  But, its scary for me to realise how quickly I became depressed all over again.  :(  Brought back so many issues that I havent dealt with, nor do I really want to deal with.  I think I may try what Katrina is doing, and just have a journal, and fill it with figuring yourself out.  



I saw Batman today.  Fucking <b>AWSOME</b> movie!  It was shot incredibly well and, suprisingly, artistic like, what with all the fights they had.  Seriously, I would probably buy that movie, and I dont buy a lot of those!  



I almost bought a fish today too.  But, since I had forgotten to call my mom to tell her when to pick me up (ah, the joys of there being only 2 weeks until your 16th birthday, and still needing rides from the parentals) she was pissed, and wasnt going to let me take 5 minutes to buy a fish.  Damn it.  *pouts*


I changed my layout again as well.  Im not really liking it, but I needed a change.  It will have to do for now.


<b>Only <i>4</i> days until Charlie and the Chocolate Factory comes out, and only <i>5</i> days until the new Harry Potter book comes out- Im so excited!!!1!! </b>

Listed below are some warning signs to indicate if your child may have gone
astray from the Lord. Gothic (or goth) is a very obscure and often dangerous
culture that young teenagers are prone to participating in. The gothic
culture leads young, susceptible minds into an imagined world of evil,
darkness, and violence. Please seek immediate attention through counselling,
prayer, and parental guidance to rid your child of Satan's temptations if
five or more of the following are applicable to your child.

-Frequently wears black clothing.
-<b>Wears band and/or rock t-shirts.</b>
-Wears excessive black eye makeup,lipstick or nail polish.
-Wears any odd silver jewelry or symbols.
-<b>Shows an interest in piercings or tattoos.</b>
-<b>Listens to gothic or any other anti-social genres of music.</b> (Marilyn Manson claims to be the anti-Christ, and publicly speaks against the Lord. Please discard any such albums IMMEDIATELY.)                                                                  -<b>Associates with other people that dress, act or speak eccentrically.</b>
-Shows a declining interest in wholesome activities, such as: <u>the Bible,
prayer, church or sports.</u>
-Shows an increasing interest in death, vampires, magic, the occult,
witchcraft or anything else that involves Satan.
-Takes drugs.
-Drinks alcohol.
-Is suicidal and/or depressed.
-Cuts, burns or partakes in any other method of self-mutilation.(This is a
Satanic ritual that uses pain to detract from the light of God and His love.
Please seek immediate attention for this at your local mental health
center.) 
-<b>Complains of boredom.</b>
-<b>Sleeps too excessively or too little.</b>
-Is excessively awake during the night.
-Demands an unusual amount of privacy.
-<b>Spends large amounts of time alone.</b>
-<b>Requests time alone and quietness. <u>(This is so that your chid may speak to evil sprits through meditation.)</u></b>
-<b>Insists on spending time with friends while unaccompanied by an adult.</b>
-Disregards authority figures; teachers, priests, nuns and elders are but a
few examples of this.
-Misbehaves at school.
-Misbehaves at home.
-Eats excessively or too little
-<u>Eats goth-related foods. Count Dracula cereal is an example of this.</u>
-Drinks blood or expresses an interest in drinking blood. (Vampires believe
this is how to attain Satan. This act is very dangerous and should be
stopped immediately.) 
-<b><u>Watches cable television or any other corrupted media
sources. (Ask your local church for proper programs that your child may
watch.)</u></b>
-<b>Plays videos games that contains violence or role-playing nature.</b>
-<b>Uses the internet excessively and frequently makes time for the computer.</b>
-Makes Satanic symbols and/or violently shakes head to music.
-Dances to music in a provocative or sexual manner.
-Expresses an interest in sex.
-Masturbates.
-Is homosexual and/or bisexual.
-Pursues dangerous cult religions. Such include: Satanism, Scientology,
<u>Philosophy</u>, Paganism, Wicca, <u>Hinduism and Buddhism.</u>
-Wears pins, stickers or anything else that contains these various phrases:
""I'm so gothic, I'm dead"", ""woe is me"", ""I'm a goth"".
-Claims to be a goth.

If five or more of these apply to your child, please intervene immediately.
The gothic culture is dangerous and Satan thrives within it. If any of these
problems persist, enlist your child into your local mental health center.

"event","So I hope you all had a good 4th of July and set fire to many fireworks (or at least more than I did.  Which was one.)  We drove up to our friends trailer up by Canada, and hung out there for the day.  But, we had to leave before the fireworks started. :(  But it was pretty cool, becuase we were driving down the highway, and all of the houses where doing really big, pretty ones.  So I got to see more.  And, once or friends come back to W-ville, we're going to get together and light of all of the one's that we bought but never did.  Minus the Roman candeles, because those were fucking fun to light, and make them bounce over the water.  :D


So, I got to babysit the two Indian girls today.  Juhi and Neelie.  So nice, and so cute.  But I <b>never</b> want to do fucking arts and crafts for such a long time.  6 hours today, and thats all we did.  *dies*  But, I made $45, so, you know, thats not too bad!


And we figured out what my rash was from.  It turns out, it was an allergic reaction I was having for my medicine I was taking for my knee.  So, I am now on 2 different meds, 1 to take away the rash (and the pill, has NO coating, so its nasty as hell to take and the taste doesnt go away for like, 5 minutes.)  and one for the itch.  But the one for the itch doesnt really do anything, so I still have to take oatmeal baths.  But those are very relaxing, so its nice. :D"

Friday school gets out, I go bowling with Heidi, Jenny and Maehreen.  Sondra and I get in a huge fight.

Saturday, hurt my knee, am not supposed to walk on it for 2 weeks.

Next Friday, still cant walk on it, and Sondra and I talk.  Fight is somewhat over.


Wednesday, participated in karate, because we just did drills, and my knee felt ok.

Thursday, help my mom clean stuff for our G-sale and have a water fight with my brother.

Saturday, wake up with this huge ass rash all over my arms.  It then quickly spreads, forcing me not to go to karate.  I am not allowed to go to the doctor until Tuesday evening, because thats the only time my mom says she'll drive me.  Fuck.  So this shit I have on my arms (and currently, legs, hands, back, neck, and I think face) itches like a bitch.  FUCK.)


Everyone I know, is talking about how much this summer is awsome.  Really?  Because it obviously fucking <b>hates</b> me."

God, I have karate tomorrow, and I dont really feel like going.  We're going over a technique we learned last week, but I could only sit there and watch, because my knee was still hurting.  I kinda remember how they did it, but its a hard technique for me, because one arm is attacking one part of the body, while the other is doing something else, and one of them you cant see, and while in the mean time, you keep shuffling forward, to try and get them off of you.   *sigh*  But I need to go, as Im not going to camp, as Im out of town.  Plus, I need to tell the karate teachers that I need my test moved back like a week or so.  *sigh*"

I suppose I just need to run a bunch of virus scans and shit.  *sigh*  But, on the brighter news, I got my iPod replaced!  Yay!  Its very pretty now, what with it having no scratches/dents.  xD"

"event","Oh man, on Wednesday in karate, we had the best conversation- Why Pirates and Ninjas cannot be the same thing.  For instance, you cant throw a chinese star thingy with a hook.  And when you sneak around in the shaodws, you cannot have a parrot on your shoulder, squaking.  But, you can be a ninja and be a dude from Star Wars.  That would be acceptable.

Haha, I love it when we have discussions like that."

"event","*gasp* I got my grades today!!!  So, my grades where:
ASL: A-
Biology: B (She said I put forth great effort.  I didnt but, whaterver.)
PE: B+ (He said that I needed to put forth more effort.  I was also very curtious and mature.  And missing homework effected my grade.  Whatever.)
Math: B- (I was a pleasure to have in class.  God, I loved that class.)
CAT 2: A-
English: A (I participated frequently.)


Sweet.


But, anywho, I met the people who Im babysitting for. They seem really nice, and when I left, the kids wanted to know why I wasnt staying to play with them.  Aw!  They're Indian (not Native American Indian, Indians from India) and the little girls are so pretty!  They've got really big eyes, and ah!  Adorable!  I cant wait to start babysitting them!"

Which means, I now probably have a steady job with them, and Im going to be interviewed/meet the kids for a new job tonight.  Sweet...  And, they evidently live in the really rich part of the neighborhood, which makes it all the better!



And, Im curious.  Has anyone from IHS gotten their grades yet?  Because Im dying, as I want to know what I got.  *pouts*"

"event","If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely 100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it would look something like the following--

There would be:
57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
8 Africans
52 would be female
48 would be male
70 would be non-white
30 would be white
70 would be non-Christian
30 would be Christian
89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual

6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth and all 6 would be from the United States.

80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
1 (yes only 1) would have a college education
1 would own a computer

When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective, the need of acceptance, understand, and education becomes glaringly apparent. The following is also something to ponder...

If you woke up this morning with more health than illness...you are more blessed than the million who will not survive this week.

If you have never experienced the danger of battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation...you are ahead of 500 million people in the world.

If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment, arrest, torture, or death...you are more blessed than three million people in the world.

If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof overhead, and a place to sleep...you are richer than 75% of this world.

If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a dish some place...you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If your parents are still alive and still married...you are very rare, even in the United States and Canada.

be thankful."

"event","Seriously.  Everyone is like, ""Wow, summer '05 is so much fun!""  Really?  Because I fucked up my knee, making it impossible to do my running I usually do in the summer, and not allowing me to do anything.  Not even karate for two weeks.  So basically, Ive sat on my ass this whole time.

I havent even done shit with friends.  I went bowling the night school ended, and yesterday I went to the mall with Kathryn.  But, thats it. Fuck, I need more hobbies.

So, I faced the pain that I knew I would have in my knee today, by taking my dog on a walk.  We went through the trails, and when you have Coldplay/really relaxing music on your iPod, its really nice.  I should do that more often.

Plus, my iPod hates my computer.  It doesnt recognize it, so I cant put any more music on it.  I even went to the apple message board and posted about it, and nobody knows whats wrong with it.  <b>FUCK!</b>"

"event","<P>So today, Kathryn and I went to the mall. I bought lots of stuff (posters, shoes, necklace, iPod cover with HAPPY BUNNY!, the bracelet from Hot Topic, and a CD.) Yay for shopping! But the greatest and most grand thing? The cd we found that was ""A Blue Grass Tribute to Metalica."" Jesus, that was the most weird ass thing I think I have ever seen. That, and the hip-hop tribute to Metalica. Jesus christ, what are people thinking?!?</P>

<P>In other news, my iPod is broken. It doesnt recognize my computer, so I have to drive all the way back out to Alderwood, so I can convince the people at the Apple Store to give me a new iPod. But, Im sure they will. I just have to ask really, really nicely.</P>"

"event","I've been neglecting my journal for a long time.  I shouldn't.  It's a good thing.

I have been so excited by life, by everyone, by everything.  So excited that I have become distracted.

I was told a long time ago that I was an engaging storyteller.  That was before my stories were really all that exciting.  Now, I have ridiculous stories aplenty.  They've gotten so insane that when I run into someone I haven't seen in awhile (i.e., more than a couple of weeks) I often have so much I could tell them it's hard to know where to begin.  I try to be aware of not alienating people.  I noticed 1 or 2 times... I mean, people always get very engrossed in my recent stories, because they are good stories... but I have noticed that, yes, of course I'm dominating the conversation, and after I've done that for hours to tell them, oh, 20% of the exciting goings on in my life as of late, and need to pause for water or whatnot and turn the conversation to the others... well sometimes they just stare at me blankly.  ""Well, um, yeah... I don't really have anything exciting to talk about.""  

Y'know... I'm happy for people, if this is what they want out of life.  I think some people lived chaotic early lives.  Some people crave stability.  Some just want predictability and calm.  It's cool if it makes them happy.  Those, however, who give me that look of... ""why do you get to do all this stuff and I don't?""  Well, I feel sad for them.  Sad because, well, fuck... 

A guy I know sent me a message the other day.  He asked if I still lived on the west side.  I said that I lived downtown.  He asked if I went out a lot downtown.  I said, of course, almost too much.... the only real problem or complaint I had was that I had too much going on and couldn't be in more than one place at one time.  He responded that he wished he could go out more but when he got home from work he was just way too mentally exhausted to do anything.

I don't remember feeling that way since I was working full time and going to school full time and was really depressed and got migraines all the time.  And then, anyone who read my journal knows about my health and probably that I almost died. Of course I didn't go out much during that time, though surprisingly still probably more than I did when I was stressed / depressed.  Well... now that they found a treatment for my joints, and my health is getting better.... wow... what a world of difference.  I just cannot imagine feeling that way.  I can't imagine letting something as petty as work getting to me like that.  I can't imagine... I dunno... I can't imagine ever feeling compelled to do something I didn't love doing to begin with.  Why?  How could I ever let myself be that unhappy?  That stressed?  What would it even take at this point?  Every moment seems worth being savored.  It's hard for me to do things I don't like; and it's hard for me to dislike the things I do.

So back from the tangents... I tell all these stories... these giddy, happy, crazy, wild, tangential, fucked up, wacky, liberating, hilarious, tragic, outrageous stories.  People make faces.  The cringe, they laugh, they gasp, they smile, they tear up.  I get all this engagement.  And now I've had all these people tell me, ""You should write a book!""  And the thing is... I keep thinking about it.  But now I'm not just thinking about one book.... I'm thinking about several.  Is that crazy?  Do I care?

The problem is... I still need to finish my prelim and dissertation.  Writing a book is no small task.  Well, neither is writing these other things.  I can't focus though.  I keep thinking about these books.  One of them I keep thinking about and it excites me.  The idea of writing it excites me so much.  I already pretty much know how it will begin, end, the characters (real people), format, outline.  I wonder if I'll be able to concentrate on school if I don't write it.  I wonder if it's even possible for me to not write it at this juncture.  I wonder if I could write pieces or outlines here and there.  I've never been good at multi-tasking.  I always do large chunks, one big project then another.  But a book?  That's really big.  Not sure how to do this... or not... in chunks."

"event","Heh.

So he did never respond to my email, but did respond to others that the other TA had sent. He responded to them as though the day before had never happened.

I think the best part was... He had asked me to change the handout I had done, and to draft a specific email.  Also to get it cleared with him before I sent it off to my students.  The other TA went ahead without consent (but ignorant of any of the events the day before), drafted her own email to the whole class, and sent out the handout I had done without changing it.  Made me a little happy, cause now he looks like a bigger d-bag, and has to contend with it."

He moved a shit ton of his things into the apartment.  But really so much that the whole bedroom is overrun with shit.  I can't get to my dresser.  I asked when we could deal with it.  He's not off again til Sunday.  Awesome.

So... he decided to have a bunch of people over, and play their shitty music.  Eh, I was actually doing okay by then.  Then they went out, and got really drunk.  He came home with even more people.  They were so fucked up.  They had food.  They came in, obnoxiously took over my futon and my computer.  Played really loud music, and ate on my ""bed"".  They spilled food and drinks everywhere.  Food all over my futon cover which I get to sleep on now.  They spilled drinks all over the floor.  Then one of them came and used my good cream colored towel to soak it up.  

And then they all left...

"event","So let's move onto what happened in the morning with the instructor of the course.  To give some context, he's new.  He's never taught before.  He has way less education and teaching experience than I do.  He's also younger than I am.  He knows this.  I know this.  He has made some glaring mistakes in teaching.  Glaring mistakes in setting up dynamics.  Basically he has been wholly incompetent all semester and completely hands off.  But, the other TA and I have been working together for awhile.  We've picked up the slack, and we've had his back.  I've given him pointers.  I've helped correct some of his big mistakes behind the scenes so that he doesn't look like a huge ass-hat.  He's afraid to talk about one of our big topics that needs to be addressed, so he asked if I'd do it.  I said I could if he wanted.  I sent him a bunch of stuff... an outline and videos to look over.  He said he would.  He didn't.  So that's been the semester so far.  

So after the email exchange and the TA and I sorted everything out... the instructor, decided that because the two TAs disagreed on one assignment (and although this was not the first time we've disagreed, this was the first time he interfered before we resolved it)... well, he decided we should have a meeting.  The other TA could not come.  He decided I should go anyway.  I went.  He asked what the problem was.  I explained it, and that we worked it out.  He said that was not sufficient, he needed to have the final say, and from now on he needed to have the final say on everything.  Even if I sent an email to my students.  He scolded me for sending an update to my students on the status of their grading, for which I'm responsible.  

Next, he said I would have to create a new assignment for the students this weekend, make sure the other TA was involved in the creation and that she was okay with it, then send it on to him for final approval, then post it for the students.  I reminded him that I was having my second medical procedure of the week an hour later, and that I would not be in any condition to work this weekend.  He questioned the validity of that... ""the whole weekend?""  And acted as though I was faking or somehow shirking my responsibilities.  He also said that he did not think it unreasonable to expect me to work all next week during my holiday break if I was going to be taking off the weekend for these medical procedures.  (Let's keep in mind I'm a 33% TA, with disability accommodations and medical leave on top of it).  He said he did not believe I could not work the whole time because I would be TAing.  I tried to explain that my ankle would still be numbed from the procedure, that I would be expending the last of my energy on crutches, with a very unstable back that had just been worked on, and then I would have to crutch to my inaccessible apartment afterward, which would all leave me very sore.  That I could make it through the one session, but it would be unreasonable to expect me to concentrate and work all reason and come up with a meaningful new assignment.  Then I realized how ridiculous it was that I was justifying my disability and medical procedures to him, especially since the only reason I was not taking the time off was because when I tried the time before both he and the other TA said they were unavailable.  So I had to go regardless.  

Well, after I explained why I could not do this, then he asked accusatorily if I had been canceling my sections that semester and hiding it from him.  So that was awesome.  By the end of the meeting I was really upset.  He was basically saying really ludicrous, but threatening things to hold power over me.  I told him that I would do whatever he said, but it was uncomfortable, and that without feedback from him, etc, I couldn't imagine it a good idea for me to do a lecture with these dynamics.  He did not much like that.  He still wants me to do all of the hard work for the class.  But meh, if I have to do 18 layers of check in for everything, which will take extra time and energy, I'm not wasting my other energy elsewhere.

He made sure to follow up with me on another email ""Just to be clear about what we talked about today"".  In the email he wanted to make sure that I understood that I could no longer make unilateral decisions about changing things on the syllabus, or about changing assignments, etc.  I had to run everything by him.  I was pretty angry by then.  Because I never had, he was twisting what we had discussed to turn me into a problem -- a person who had done unauthorized things.  In the email he asked if there was anything that needed to be clarified.  I responded.  We'll see what happens with it.  I think it may get ugly.

I responded that I did want clarity, because he was stating all this as a ""change"" in policy and saying that I could no longer do things that I had never done.  I wanted to clarify in the email that I'd never made any unilateral decisions or even trilateral decisions to change the course.  I listed all of the emails I'd ever sent.

I then followed up with my upset about being accused of not fulfilling my duties as a TA, him not respecting my disability and medical needs, and accusing me of canceling class without any evidence of such things.  I ended my email with this:

""I understand your position, and I will comply with whatever you ask.  However, as much as you require my compliance and understanding, I require your understanding and that you respect both my medical needs, and the fact that even ill I have gone well above and beyond as a TA to help make this course run smoothly.  I will respect your wishes and run everything by you, but you cannot expect more from me than a normal TA with those dynamics.  If you have any misunderstandings of what that is, you can look at the TAA guidelines.  Also, if my disability is causing you any concern, I can have my disability liaison or someone from the Office of Equity and Diversity contact you about policy regarding students and employees with disabilities and their accommodations.  I am sorry that we could not speak about this more easily on our own.""

When I had expressed my concern earlier about how much time everything would waste having to run everything by him... he said, ""I always have my iPhone with me"".  Yet... he still hasn't responded to my email.  I expect a lot worse before it gets better."

"event","Today I crashed.  Hard.

I did not sleep much last night because I'd stayed up very late responding to emails with my fellow TA.  We'd had a disagreement about an approach to teaching our sections.  Our students have a big project coming up, and we have to instruct them on how to complete it.  I wanted to take a more inclusive approach using different methods of delivering information, and had made a handout to give to the class that went through the sections of the assignment and provided examples/suggestions of how to approach it.  I did this to help out some of my students with learning disabilities and to provide some answers to FAQs from the time I'd taught the class before in advance.  Basically to proactively answer questions about the assignment to save email and office hours time later, since students tended to ask the same questions over and over.

The other TA said if students did not understand anything, she preferred to answer each email individually or meet with them in office hours, or wait for them to ask questions.  She wanted to take a more hands off approach.  Her biggest concern was that providing students extra suggestions is the same as making a contract, and that it obligates the students to do the assignment in a specific way, and then obligates us to grade it in a specific way as well.  

We went back & forth, with me explaining that there is a difference between providing suggestions to a student to help them launch a project or simplify it vs. criteria upon which they will be graded.  I tried also to remind her that undergrads spend much of their career taking multiple choice exams rather than writing like we do.  Sometimes hints like ""it's easier will be easier to do all of your later sections and stay with in the page limits if you choose only one issue of focus"" are not quite as intuitive to an undergrad writer.  Anyway, after about 3 emails back and forth, we came to a consensus.  I did understand her concern about not wanting to spoon feed students too much.  I think I err on the side of over-clarifying things that are not essential parts of the assignment.  For instance, if the goal of the assignment is to learn how to evaluate and write a plan to improve discrimination in an agency--I don't think students should have to spend several hours trying to figure out how to format their reference list in APA style because it was unclear and they have not yet learned how to do that. It is not integral to their learning, and I am more than happy to spoon feed them how to format their references, so that they can focus on the important parts of the assignment.  I want them to learn what I am there to teach them, rather than waste their time trying to decipher other things.

Anyway... I dunno... I think I knew what I was doing.

My students seemed appreciative, and I've already gotten more than one student emailing to ask for a copy/thank me for it.

Probably what was more annoying about the situation was that the other TA dismissed and argued that the handout that I was making was bad before she'd seen it.  

I do know I have issues with trust.  I get annoyed when people don't trust me.  My policy is to trust people until they give me a reason not to.  I know other people are not that way.  But I think it bothers me when I consistently do things competently, and someone who knows it still treats me like I might suddenly not have a clue.  I'm sure it's my ego.  When it comes to competence, certainty, and the like... I do not do well with it."

"event","I'm not sure where I would be right now without pharmaceuticals.  Pretty sure I'd be freaking out and sobbing hysterically.  Definitely in lots of pain - physically.  And who knows what kind of illness I'd be riddled with.  

At the same time, I'm pretty sure they are turning me into something of a zombie.  Not quite human anymore.  I take recreational drugs so that I can escape what has become of my life.  Really the only time I feel pleasure is when I escape reality altogether.  It makes me really happy to go to another world and not really be in my own anymore.

I'm trying very hard to cope with my real problems -- my body is falling apart; I have no money, quite literally; my schooling is hanging by a thread, and just barely; and I have very few prospects for the future.  I would be terrified if the pharmaceuticals would allow me to be, but thankfully I'm somewhat numb most of the time.

I've been trying to take things one at a time, for instance, trying to just get my prelim done at school, but things are piling up higher and higher and higher.  I keep having things that need to get done right away, and there's no time to do them.  

Appeals, appeals, appeals.  I'm so exhausted by administrative paperwork.  2 appeals to stay in school that had to be submitted multiple times; 1 appeal for financial aid; 2 appeals for social security so far, both denied, and a 3rd one I have to start soon; and another medical appeal to start to get the procedure I need to keep my joints in place.

I feel as though my new modified life now that I'm disabled takes 10x the work that it took when I was healthy, and not just because I'm sick and exhausted, but really it just takes more work.  Tons and tons of paperwork.  It's so hard not to just give up sometimes.  I really want to.

I keep thinking things will turn around.  Hoping.  But I feel like I'm sinking again.  I really thought things would go well.  I thought my insurance would come through.  I thought I'd get my financial aid.  I thought I'd get my social security.  I thought life would be good.  So confident I was that I made bad decisions...

I decided to get my teeth fixed.  $5000.  Borrowed from a 12 month plan that I have to start paying next month.  And my rent, which is equivalent to my paycheck.  And still no financial aid.... I have $20 in my checking right now.  I've had people say, ""That's what family is for"" or ""Why don't you just ask your parents?""  I wish it was pride that kept me from borrowing money from them.  I called and asked my mom for money.  I thought with how desperate things had gotten for me... to the point that I do not have money for food... that she might be able to send some.  She said, ""Your Dad is being forced to take furlough days this year, so now we don't even have enough for our mortgage.""

I'm addicted.

There's no way to deny it now.

I stopped for 2 days.

I got really sick.

I cut back to vicodin for a week.

I fell.

I went back on oxy again.  Not fully, but some again, which is more than I want to be on.

But I'm watching this show about addicts.  And they aren't saying this, but I'm watching them... and it occurs to me as these people are flying off the handle at every little moment and falling off the wagon... so to speak....

I think this is what addiction really is at my level, for me, at least how I'm projecting it:

It is being at this point where I look for any excuse.  Any excuse.

I fell.  I'm in extra pain today.  I'll cut back tomorrow.  Today was rough.

On the TV I'm watching and thinking... they had a fight, they get stressed out, someone talks trash, they're at a party and handle it... any little petty thing and they start using again...

But I'm no different...

My body is on eggshells...

I'd have to lie around in pillowy clouds of rainbows and magic and flowers all day, and maybe I'd still find an excuse if a butterfly flapped its wings the wrong way....

When I stop making excuses for myself... only then I'll truly beat this."

"event","So... I've never been one who cognitively thought that biological family was any more important than anyone else.  But I've always had this... kind of unconditional bond with my immediate family and some parts of my extended family that just, well, there's no other explanation that I can give other than... ""Hey, they're my family.""  It's not with any blood relative.  I stopped talking to my pedophile grandfather when I was younger, and by association, my grandmother.  I also have some aunts & uncles on that side that are not particularly close.  I even have one cousin on that side who, if she were drowning and I had an oar, it would be a serious debate whether to extend the oar to help her or whether to help expedite the process by pushing her head down with it.  She's a huge asshole and I really just can't imagine there are very many people whose lives are better off having been touched by her presence... other than to know that everyone else in their lives is much more considerate by comparison.  Other than that, the rest of my family, for better or worse, I feel a fondness.  Even my cousins I met very recently in Seattle & Portland.  I just felt this bond that, they were my family.  I was fond of them.  And they may not necessarily have been people that I would've immediately hung out with if I met them randomly on the street, but I didn't mind being related to them.  My uncle who has schizophrenia I really quite like despite his occasional breaks with reality.  And my uncle who has a developmental disability, well, can drive me up the wall at times, but still love him dearly.  I've always felt pretty lucky about my immediate family.  Didn't really have a lot to bitch about.  No abuse, neglect, seething hatred.  Yeah, we had differences at times, and I would get annoyed sometimes.  Generally, we tend to get along.

Lately, my little brother, though... I've always felt very strongly about him.  Ever since he was born he was extremely important to me.  He was so little, and fragile.  I remember being in the hospital so vividly.  So many events growing up.  I was happy when he was going to come down here to school.  I dropped everything to help him get in here.  

I think it was a mistake.  So yeah, he's become a pot-head, and whatever, I've been around a lot of pot-heads.  And school hasn't gone great for him... he's been apathetic about it.  I think it's common enough.  I was feeling bad about that for him.  I was used to, from last semester, not hearing from him much.  Him being a bit flaky about stuff.  But, it wasn't until this fall when things have gotten really desperate that I've had to face up to this idea that maybe my brother is just a wanker too.  I've been puking every day, so no big surprise that I've needed help.  I don't call every day, only on the days when I was puking so much that my muscles started cramping from dehydration and I was falling down.  So I called him, and begged him to come and bring me something to drink and maybe some soup since I hadn't eaten.  So if he called back at all on those days, he'd call once, not leave a message, and if I'd call back even within minutes, he wouldn't answer, and he'd never call back again.  That's if he'd even call.  This is particularly shitty since he's the only one who had my spare keys.  Well, after 4 weeks of this, I finally just got my keys back.  Of course, this took 4 phone calls.  So then he calls me today and asks if I need help with anything (I found out later because my mom told him to).  Am I being ungrateful if that made me want to punch him in the trachea?  Oh, and on the phone he also asked me why I don't just drop out and move back home with my parents in Northern WI.

So I do have my keys back.  I'm giving them to Eric.  Who has been much more like family.  I just feel so desperate right now.  I think that my brother feels like I should probably just feel lucky if he's willing to call me to offer to help at all, ever.  But I don't.  And maybe beggars shouldn't be choosy, but I don't even want help from people who are going to be assholes about it.  Honestly, I'd rather continue to physically destroy myself than to accept help from someone who makes me feel like shit about it.  Maybe it's the wrong decision.  But it's the one I'm making right now.  I only hope that I can find enough non-shitty people in my life.  I'm trying, I'm asking, and some people are responding.  And the ones who are being crappy about it... I'm withdrawing the requests.  Maybe I need to move into assisted living or a commune that accepts gimps or... something like that."

The original plan was to go to the show, leave after Jenna's act, and then go make ""special brownies"" and play board games at my friend Don's.  Well, we went to the show, and it was phenomenal.  There were a couple of mediocre acts, but most were extremely well put-together.  The burlesque performers were very talented, and in particular, there was this drag king performance troupe from Chicago called the Smarmy Chorus Girls.  I was just completely in awe of them.  Smittened, I would say.  I went and talked to one of them, only.  I was dismayed to find out they don't have a website or any way that I can find for me to stalk them.  I emailed the event coordinator today, in hopes I can find some way to track them.  I really want to see these gender bending geniuses again.  They're my new grrl/boifriends.

I get to meet Glynda tomorrow.  Hooray.

What I have done since I got here:

Thursday:  Jason picked me up at the airport. It was almost midnight PST when I landed, and I had been up since 6am CST, so very tired.  I ate and went to sleep right away.  

Friday:  We went downtown to the wharf and I got to see the bushman... still in the same spot 8 years later jumping out and scaring people.  Made me so happy, I gave him money.  We had some drinks and food, then headed to golden gate park to see the butterflies.  I found a great little hippie cafe.  We were going to come back and rest awhile, but had tickets to the Improv in San Jose to see Ralphie May.  So we drove.  It was fun, the food was good, the opening comedians were great.  Long day for a gimp, went back and crashed.

Saturday: We woke up, and I was talking about some things from Madison.  The brunches with $1 drinks and Bennett's smut n' eggs.  Got hungry, so went to the store, made eggs, bloody mary & watched porn bloopers for breakfast.  After a good nap, we got up and met Eugene, another friend, who took us to Japantown for Sushi.  We wandered around a bit.  So, Eugene is some sort of Asian descent, but never says what.  Maybe Chinese, he always claims to know Mandarin when he hears it.  He also happens to own a ninja mask.  So we were making fun of him always using his iPhone to find all the Asian places to eat/drink.  Poetically, he was walking and staring at his iPhone, and walked into a tree, and broke his phone.  So then we were making jokes all night about his ninja brawl with the tree that kicked his ass.  We ended at this karaoke bar, where the bartender fucked up, gave us quadruple shots when we ordered, then charged us a crapload.  $56 for 6 drinks.  Thankfully their smoking drove us out before we ordered any further drinks.  We came to hang out at Jason's.  Jason passed out/fell asleep.  Eugene took a bunch of pictures of him to post online.  And then we played around online, until sleepy time.

Sunday: Yan came over, and the original plan was shrooms in the park.  But the park was cold, so we ended up watching firefly instead.  Eugene came over, too.  Apparently the Orange Juice he was drinking attacked him too.  Because it comes from trees, he said.  And as we were all sitting and chilling, there was a loud explosion not a few blocks away from us, and then all these alarms on cars started going off.  We never did find out what happened.  Oh, and I got a jiggly ball.  I should post a pic of it.  I shall.  Anyway, lots of laughs and fun.

Today sometime I'm supposed to go with Jason, since it's his last day off to meet up with Julie.  I'm making him go with me 'cause she has kids.  He has trouble not swearing around kids, as do I.  So this will be nice... we can both be uncomfortable not swearing.  But really it should be fun.  She's a huge gaming geek.  And her kids are starting to be too.

And Glynda and I are going to have a fantabulous time.  Oh, and if Glynda reads this... Daly City, right by the border of the Mission district.  So might not be such a big deal for transport after all :)"

"event","... and psychedelic mushrooms...

quite possibly the best idea I ever had.  Well, in retrospect, anyway.  I suppose everything could have gone horribly wrong.  An enormous freakout, an arrest before the show (one after I wouldn't have cared), etc.  But risk, reward.  I cried at one point thinking it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.  Cheesy, it sounds, but certainly felt it at the time.  I guess sentimentally I think seeing my brother sleeping in the incubator after he'd turned from purple to fleshy color when I was 10 was probably more beautiful.  But... the colors, the music, the feel of this experience.  I'm sure it would've been amazing even without the drugs, but I don't regret taking them.

I think I figured out some things about myself on psychedelics too, though I'd probably have to hypothesis test a bit to fully support them.  1) Although my brain does get a bit numb relative to my normal state, I don't seem to really lose my ability to problem solve or my mental acuity.  Examples: Jenna asked if a picture on my phone was one I took and I found it quite funny considering the quality of the picture, as cell phones don't really take pictures of that caliber.  I remembered that her phone didn't receive texts when she went to the bathroom so knew I had to call her to get ahold of her.  She kept saying she wanted to go to sleep and I kept having to remind her we were in Chicago and still had to drive home, but that I couldn't drive until I stopped tripping.  I also remembered that the length of the experience on shrooms after not eating would probably be roughly equal to the experience after eating since Amanda and I had experiences that lasted equal lengths but started at different times when one of us ate and the other did not.  2) I don't tend to freak out even by the strangest visual things.  Robert Smith is the weirdest looking guy to begin with.  At one point his face kept morphing into this creepy demonlike figure.  At another point Jenna's skin took on this zombie-like coloring.  I just thought... eh, ya took shrooms and that will happen at times.  And I would wait for it to return to normal.  I just seem to always remember that I'm on drugs and what I'm seeing/feeling is a side effect of that.  Also, probably helps that I wasn't raised to be afraid of demons.

Anyway... it was the best.concert.ever.  So glad I did it and that all the other people who had a chance to come with me didn't get to go so that it worked out just as it was supposed to."

I just can't remember the last time I was purposely hurtful/pissy to anyone.  Not that I'm a saint, or even the ""nicest"" person in the world.  I'm most certainly not.  And I can certainly go through really ill periods where I don't ""keep up"" with friends.  But I don't ignore people, and I'm not mean to them.  I'm just me...  and I'm okay with people not liking that.  It's fine.  I just tend to have people who are okay with me as me for years, and then are still fine on a whim being shitty.  I mean, I can't even do that with people I break up with.  I don't want to be in a relationship with Eric anymore, but... I still love him for all the things I always loved him for.  He's still him.  And I still like that he's him.  

Eh... whatever... I think it was just shitty with pain and whatnot being wholloped with 2 in one night.  Enough time will go by and I'll get back to my regular routine with the friends who've not yet decided to be wankers.  I guess that's what I really see it as... this lifelong filtering process.  In the end, I hope I have at least one friend left.  More would be cool.  I don't need lots, just some good ones.  Interesting ones.  That I can just continue to be myself around forever, and maybe chill with sometimes... 

If not, I'll just get a crapload of cats, and do heroin when I'm an old lady.  Hopefully the neighborhood kids will think I'm a witch.  That'd be cool."

I've been teaching a research methods class, and I love it.  Best class for me to teach ever.

I have been eating dinner Thursdays with little bro and watching Flight of the Conchords and Scrubs.  He saved me when I was gimpy many times, and made my moving feel like it was going to be okay.  I am so grateful you moved here this last year again.

I had to learn who my ""real"" friends were again, and it pissed me off.  Because honestly, I didn't feel like putting all that much thought into it.  I just wanted to chill.  But some people actually went above and beyond regular douchebaggery.  I'm not saying, hey, they weren't there for me when I needed them... no, that's not it... I haven't even asked that much of people.  They were actually assholes to me, and kicked me when I was down to boot.  Good times.  There's a little drawing someone I know does in wow, and I think it's appropriate: ..|..
I like it.

I've hung out with Eric a few times recently.  It feels good to do this whole friend thing.  The cynic in me says it's going to implode eventually, but the optimist says... we can do it.  I think of this quote from the move ""singles.""  When they decide to be friends, Campbell Scott says, ""Let's be the first people in history to say it and really mean it.""  I always thought that was a great line.  I hope we can.  And well, if not, at least we're making a really good go at it.  In fact, when things got their worst when I was on crutches and crying, Eric ended up being the one who showed up to change my lightbulbs.  He's been one of my best friends for a long time.

I killed Illidan.


I have gone out with Leah a few times and it's always awesome.  The universe wants the world to be our oyster.  I want to go to her play.  I've been putting up posters all around my building.

I took my brother out for his 21st birthday.  He got obnoxious.  A heckler on the street told him to watch out for me because I was underage.  Made me giggle.

I bought tickets to fly out to San Francisco last night.  I got them for under $250.  I'm going in July... July 10th.

I think most people who have seen me recently are wise to the fact that I stopped sleeping and eating due to some odd medication changes.  I started taking one that suppressed my appetite and kept me up, and I stopped taking the narcotics and sleeping pills.  And of course, I've dropped the 30 lbs. in 2 months.  So that's starting to become noticeable.  It finally caught up with me on Friday morning.  All of my muscles locked up and I had difficulty moving around.  I was very weak.  I was pretty sure in the morning that I'd end up in the doctor, but I felt really dumb about it, because I knew exactly what was causing it and I didn't want to go.  I ended up eating and going to acupuncture.  I felt renewed that day.  But then I still didn't sleep for the next 2 days.  And I started arguing with someone and I was so tired and angry and surly, and I knew I had to start work the next day.  I ended up just taking a sleeping pill again, after weeks of being off them.  It knocked me right out.  And I finallly slept for the first time in weeks.

I found out because I was being so anti-social this weekend I missed my wonderful friend Caley, who had tried to email me on my work email (which I was not checking), and was only in town for the weekend.  I also missed Leah, who tried to contact me on LJ.  I bungled up two potential social contacts.  One of which I cannot make up.  However, on Sunday, I did get out of the house with Amanda, and I got a new swimsuit.  I found out that I dropped 6 sizes in jeans as well.  I guess that's a lot, but probably partially their tendency to downsize things every few months.  I guess it's nice to get new jeans after having ripped the crotch out of 2 pairs just this winter.

So, I did something yesterday.  I want to get out of the house more.  I want to do something with Leah this week, and the mysterious *hyarrostar*, if we can work out our schedules.  And then next week, I plan to start weightlifting with a friend here at WC who is now officially a survivor of cancer.  Get these atrophied muscles working again.  I bet that will help a lot.  So... still want to get off the drugs altogether.  Still want to be healthier about my fitness.  Still want to be social.  I think I need to allow myself to go partly in the right direction and give myself some allowances.  Hard from going all fucked up to all healthy."

I was expecting them to do it.  I felt a little... well very nervous.  But, thankfully I was able to call Anna and get her feedback on the cover letter.  And in the end, it was really nice to be able to do it myself.  I felt as though it was really my manuscript.  I am a little nervous about the review process, but just a little.  I want it to go well, but I think it was just so difficult finishing the paper and getting it out.  Hopefully I'm not being overconfident.  I guess it would suck to have it completely trashed in peer review.  I would be fairly disappointed.

I have my fingers crossed that it makes it in.  I really want it to get into the first issue, which was the goal.  I want to celebrate, but maybe I should wait til reviews are done... probably a better bet.

I guess in other news, I got my second injection last week.  My first one went perfectly, until I walked on it and bruised it.  The second one, not so perfectly.  He missed the injection spot, and ground the needle on the bone and the joint more than once.  He hit the spot where I had my microfracture procedure a couple of times and I felt it.  It hurt just a bit.  The pain was not what got me.  It was just psychologically... I tried taking deep breaths, and repeating the mantra ""you're okay, you're okay,"" but he ground it a 3rd time, and suddenly I wasn't okay and I blacked out.  My vision closed in.  Thankfully I hadn't eaten, so there was no vomiting.  I had to lie down.  All this was a good thing, though, because he pulled the needle out and started over, and then it only took about 20 seconds.  And I didn't bruise the joint this time, so it only really hurt a couple of days instead of 5.  I get my 3rd injection on July 5th.  I also took the 6th off.  I'm glad about this.  I'm just going to veg.

"event","When I was maybe 20 or so, and Cassidy and I started dating, I met Seth and Walter.  Walter lived in Evan Scholars with Cassidy.  Seth was Walter's best friend, and a local Madison musician.  He played on State Street very often.  I would very often walk down the street and hear folksy music and stop and listen to Seth play.  Or we would go to a coffee shop show that he was doing.  Sometimes Walter would play with him.  Seth's songs were the kinds of songs where he was telling a story about something that had happened, or letting bare a part of his soul, or sometimes they were great metaphors about dreams.  And then he would throw in a fantastic superficial song like ""You and me baby got it goin' on"".  I paid attention to all of them, enchanted with his stories.  I was mesmerized by Seth, who spent time in a kibbutz in Israel, found a butterfly in a desert, who wandered Europe playing guitar with Walter for money, and who still found the time mess with a bad motherfucker.  And he was so introverted... he lived in his head, as I was wont to do at times when I was working on statistics (like the extra credit problem that I was so close to figuring out) or other geeky things (like the latest and greatest Khlorm joke on World of Warcraft).  One time, I brought my family to one of the coffee shop shows, and my little brother was there.  He was only 12 years old at the time.  Seth's shows were not ever obscene, but he did have a few innuendos, occasional swearing and adult themes.  But with my little brother there, he got this little smile, and he launched into this song I had never heard before.  It was innocent and funny and clever, clearly written long before, about not having the energy to go to school that day.  I remember my family really enjoying his stories and the show.  And Walter would play with Seth sometimes... those were some of my favorite sets.  You could tell how much they enjoyed being together, and energy like that emanates, spreads throughout the room.  I was able to enter their world a little bit, with Cassidy.  When the four of us were together, we would all talk, and those interactions were always quite pleasant.  Even Seth would join us at times, extrovert himself a tad and bring out the jokes when the other three of us would get going.  And Walter really shared the love with us.  He was the manager at the Memorial Union at the time that we had our ""legal ceremony"".  A day that I had totally dismissed in my head and put no planning into.  We met the Justice at the union that day, and Walt happened to be working.  He was so excited to be there.  He stepped away from work, got out the big ring o' keys, and took us out to this big private terrace overlooking the lake.  This is where people usually have to pay and book months or over a year in advance for their weddings.  On that Saturday, we had our little ceremony, with Walter standing by us, beaming.  He signed our license, even.  Then 2 months later when we had our party and planned *ceremony*, he and Seth came, brought their guitars and played music for us.  Although the marriage itself toppled so quickly, that day was honestly one of the best memories I have.  So many special people came to be there.  I remember thinking, and I believe I even told someone that, I didn't care about the wedding part.  It was just seeing everyone in the same place, made my heart swell.  I didn't want it to end.  

When I got back from Europe and we split, I ran into Seth and Walter.  They were friendly and cordial, and being the peaceful and chill guys they were, they were not going to snub me for a silly little thing like crushing the heart of a friend.  These things happen.  Though, I knew things wouldn't be the same, the dynamics if I was alone and not with Cassidy.  I was a different person alone.  I kept stopping to see Seth play when I heard him.  One time I went to visit him at his apartment, where he and Walter lived, but Walter was gone.  This was the fateful day, when he beat me in Tetris, the only person who has ever clearly defeated me in Tetris.  There is a rumor that he has gotten 300 lines in Game A of original Tetris, and I was skeptical, but I can attest that he did slay me one on one.  And before I met him, I had never met anyone who was better than I was.  Despite my newfound tetris envy, I knew things were just not quite as connected as I maybe had hoped.  I think it was so much easier for me to feel connected to Seth, Mr. Introvert who shared all of his inner thoughts on stage and in his music, than it probably was for him to feel any sort of connection back.  Even if I were to say, ""me too!  Yeah, I totally agree!  Oh, and, I like your music.""  It's... just not the same.  So, shortly after this, Walter got engaged, and then married.  He moved away to Appleton.  Then awhile later Seth moved to New Mexico.  We messaged once very briefly last year on Friendster, but nothing too in depth.  

Then, this week, I got an email that he would be in Wisconsin this week touring with his band.  They played during the day Wednesday at Memorial Union, but I was working.  But I noticed they would be playing tonight in Minocqua, which is about 30 minutes or so from my parents' house.  Tomorrow is my grandma's wedding, so we were coming up for that anyway.  I convinced Eric to leave the night before so we could go to the show, and my parents agreed to meet us.  So, we went.  And, although I wasn't expecting it, Walter was there, too.  I got the surprised, but warm greetings I expected, because I did pick an odd gig to attend. I wished I could've spoken with both of them all night, but we did get to talk some.  The band ""Meat the Vegans"", music was very different from Seth's folk music, but it still was colored by him.  They did a cover of ""I'd love to change the world"", and even though the song is not at all folksy, there was just something so Sethy in it, that I looked at him, I looked at Walter, I had a flash of nostalgia for my early 20s and tears ran down my eyes.  When I said goodbye to them, I gave them hugs, and I stumbled over words, the usual ""take cares"" and such, but if I could have said what my heart wanted to say, I would have said something like, ""Seeing you tonight both makes my heart swell and break at the same time.  Although we play such a small part in one another's lives right now, the memories I have of you are keepsakes and you are someone that I will always treasure.""

I also found out from Walter that he tried to email Cassidy as well, and that he did not get a response.  So that means that his email address probably is defunct.  The last email I sent him, I said I would understand if he did not want to respond and I wouldn't bother him, but then I always wondered if he ever got it.  Now I am thinking he didn't.  I am considering trying again.  Seeing Seth and Walter tonight.  They made me ache for everyone.  Including Cassidy.  Not as my ex-husband.  We were horrible as a couple.  Depressing and depressed.  But we were such good friends before that escapade.  I know I can never have it back.  And I usually try not to regret.  I know I needed to do what I did at the time.  But, I miss my friend terribly.  I really did care for him.  Hopefully I can stop wallowing and crying in time to get sleep for my Grandma's wedding tomorrow.  I probably will not feel as nostalgic with them."

Though I learned all the lyrics and it didn't really seem to be much about jealousy at all.  I really loved that song.  I don't listen to it much anymore, but I still do kinda like it.  It has one line, ""if you don't expect too much from me, you might not be let down.""

I think I really took that line to heart, at least with my friends (the established ones).  For the most part.  Realizing that if I kept my expectations low enough they would never, ever disappoint me.  By and large this defense has worked for me.  Still, I find that no matter how low I set the bar, some people still manage to limbo under it.  Curious.  I don't want to be high maintenance, but I am tired of people being fuckers.  I guess it's time for a little bar-raising.  Thankfully, I have kept it high for my romantic relationships.  And, some people are just engaging friends no matter what my expectations are.

"event","The doctor tried to prescribe me another drug for pain.  I punched her in the face and told her to take it herself... y'know...  to stop the pain in her face.  Not really, I just said I didn't want to take anymore drugs.  That in fact, I wanted to stop taking the drugs I was currently taking.  She said okay, and ended up writing me a prescription for a TENS unit.  I got it from my PT on Thursday.  Since then I have only had to take painkillers for migraines (which I had a lot this week because of my bi-annual menstrual cycle), but other than that, it has been amazing.  I use it usually only 2 times a day, 4 at most if I really fuck up my ankle.  I also stopped taking sleep meds... which made me stop sleeping, but, ah well.  I finally slept again last night, so I think it is catching up.  So, yesterday... I did my elliptical trainer for the first time in almost a year (and I only did it about 3 times total last year).  I was able to do it a full half hour and reach my target *distance*, which doesn't mean much on ellipticals, but anyway.  It hurt a bit afterward, but the TENS took care of it post haste.  So... I think I can exercise again.  I am still going to do the injections, because I think my ankle could still do better than it is, but... even without them I am going to dance by the end of the summer.  In addition to all this, the TENS works great on back and neck pain as well... I've already used it 4 times for that.  I wish I had had it sooner, but either way, I am so happy to have it now.  It makes it so much easier to ""suck it up"" when I know the pain is going to stop in the near future.   I feel so much stronger right now."

And I got these new electrodes to hook up to my ankle and zap it to... alter the perception of pain.  I got this prescribed from the pain clinic.  It actually zaps pretty hard, and I've only gotten up about 2/3 so far.  Strange how replacing the pain with a new pain helps, but somehow it seems to.  I think it's the persistent burning, and anything to change that at all is nice.  I don't want to take drugs anymore.  Also, the PT said if I wanted I could use it to zap my other owwies on my back and whatnot.

"event","Usually when I start to think things are hopeless, something happens to remind me that I my life is not so tragic.  I forget that things rarely end in total doom.  I guess it's my old dramatic nature creeping out again.

I got a very unexpected call from the PA at my new surgeon's office.  He talked with the synvisc rep, and they worked out some sort of deal where they are writing off the injections and giving them to me free of charge.  I assume it is because I am the first patient at this particular site to get them in the ankle and I am a fresh, young and appropriate candidate.  If they work out well, the surgeon is more likely to use them again with other patients who can afford them.  Regardless of the rep's motivations, I am grateful and excited.  First injections start in a little less than a month.  Don't you just love your new orthopedic surgeon?

I am in Atlanta, at another conference.  Traveling is hard on me.  Not just physically.  I get so tired.  And then a bunch of little things happen.  Flight delay.  Hotel room mix-up.  Broken alarm clock.  Being put on hold 20 minutes.  Being disconnected.  And then I just snap and start crying.  But then the hotel responds and gives me free room service.... A bad message it sends.  I hate that I always get nice things when I cry.  I wish people would just be nice to me when I'm pleasant.  

But, back to the semi-charmed thing and *it* working out.  My old new boyfriend from wow has a new saying that makes me chuckle.  At the start of anything, he says, ""What can go wrong?""

I like that."

"event","So actually, just no injections.  Even though the FDA approved these injections in 1998, they only approved them for the knee.  If I were in Europe, I could get them.  Sucks that if something makes a penis hard or makes a person not eat, they can get approved right away, even if they cause death.  But harmless injections cannot get approved, even with evidence that they help with pain.  Fuck you, FDA."

"event","I met my new doc.  I found out today that no matter how much or how long my ankle hurts, until something structurally changes (it grinds down, the bones give, the joint displaces, etc.), they have absolutely no prognosis.  Well, aside from that I will never run, jump, etc.  Hmmm.  I thought I knew what was happening with my ankle.  I thought since it kept hurting more that it was just getting worse and that was that.  But the doctor said that despite this, it could still stop hurting so much in 6 months, 2 years, 10 years.  Good and bad, I guess.  There is hope.  I might not always hurt.  At the same time, I might hurt forever, but will never qualify for permanent disability or any of the fellowships that I thought I might.  I guess... good to know and accept now.  

So... what to do.  I wait to find out if these new injections he recommended are covered by my insurance.  They are supposed to lubricate the joint and in some people make it not hurt so much.  And when my age doubles, he said I can look into joint replacement.  I bet he won't be doing them anymore.  And I bet they will be somewhat better.  I hope the injections are covered... and then I hope they help.  Fingers crossed."

"event","I do have to turn one in tomorrow, but 4 days early.  I'm done with my master's and my Ph.D. coursework.  Now all I have to do is... everything else.  It's going to be really nice not having to do a bunch of assignments that are going to be evaluated for grades anymore.  I'm pretty pumped about that.

I think June... July... something.  I don't know what I am going to do.  I feel a little panicky.  I need to chill out.

Stress my ass."

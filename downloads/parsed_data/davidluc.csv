Each case contains 12 pizzas.</p><p>The possible E. coli contamination was uncovered by state and federal authorities investigating 21 E. coli-related illnesses in 10 states.</p><p>General Mills said nine of the 21 people reported having eaten Totino's or Jeno's pizza with pepperoni topping at some point before becoming ill.</p><p>The people became ill between July 20 and October 10, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said, adding that all the patients recovered.</p><p>The people did not have packages with dates codes or other information General Mills needs to narrow down which pizzas might be affected, General Mills spokesman Tom Forsythe said, adding that, for the same reason, the company could not determine which of its suppliers provided the pepperoni.</p><p>E.coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacteria that can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration.

"event","I just got back from the Young Love concert and can I just say it was FUCKING AMAZING! I have to say it was one of the best concerts I have been to in a long ass time (and I go to a lot of concerts). The music was great, he was awesome on stage just dancing around, and even though the venue was out in the middle of no where it was really big and there were only a handful of people there so you felt really connected to the artist. Right before the last song he made everyone upstairs (in the 21+ section) to come down on the dance floor it was so cool being so close to Young Love and just dancing around. I love discovering an artist right before he gets huge - trust me this guy is going to be so big - I can say that I got to see him at his first show in Seattle playing to only a handful of people, I think that is fuckin cool. (Plus the guys is so fuckin cute and nice, I went up to him after the show and was like ""dude that show was fuckin sick"" and he shook my hand and said thanks and signed my CD. That is a cool guy.)<br /><br />Anyways I forgot to bring my camera but I had my phone and recorded parts of his show, once I figure out this youtube thing I will post the video.<br /><br />Check out who I am talking about, and if you get the chance to see him live now - take advantage of it, seriously!<br /><a class=""l"" onmousedown=""return clk(this.href,'','','res','1','')"" href=""http://www.myspace.com/younglove""><font color=""#551a8b"">www.myspace.com/younglove</font></a><br /><a href=""http://www6.islandrecords.com/site/artist_home.php?artist_id=623"">http://www6.islandrecords.com/site/artist_home.php?artist_id=623</a><br /><br />"

"event","Tonight's Super Bowl was great - the weather conditions made the game even more exciting. Even though the the Seahawks didn't make it this year (aw sad) I still think the two best teams this season played tonight (the Saints and Reggie Bush also had a great season). I am glad the Colts won - I think Peyton Manning is the best regular season quarterback especially during the past the 3-4 seasons, but the team always sucked ass when it came down to the post season. I remember the Orange Bowl game between the Huskers and Volunteers - even though Tennessee lost that game it was pretty obvious that Peyton would go on to bigger things (not like Eric Couch). Anyways the game was really exciting, kick-off return for a touch down by Chicago was fuckin ridiculous and considering how often Indianapolis was in the red zone and how they could not convert and had to settle for field goals kept the game tight and frustrating at the same time. I got a little tipsy but still enjoyed myself.

On a completely different note, I don't know how it is in other parts of the world but I find as I get older the possible dating pool of gay men starts to shrink. I find it fascinating that I can't meet someone who isn't already friends with or has dated someone that does not like me or that I do not like (which considering the gay population in Seattle is almost everyone). Where have all the original guys gone?"

on a complete side note... MTV needs to start doing their dating shows somewhere other than California. I was watching a couple episodes of their new dating show ""Exposed"" (they put dating contestants through voice detection lie detector software - yeah... i think its bullshit too) and I swear they are recycling people from ""Next"" and ""Parental Control"". Seriously MTV you should try like Seattle or something, there is plenty of dating drama and stupidity up here."

Since&nbsp;I was obviously none of those things, I didn't think I would ever&nbsp;find love. It's pathetic, I know, but I was 19-20, had absolutely no self confidence and associated myself with people who were not supporting me.

"event","Buying shoes today at Nordstrom when I run into Ryan Cabrera... weird. 

Now I know if I were living in LA or NY seeing a ""celebrity"" out and about shopping isn't too surprising, but I live in Seattle, I might see Dave Matthews once in a while or the guys from Death Cab at a bar, or Danny from the Real World at my gym, but that's about it. What's even weirder he was there with two 14 y/o girls. I wanted to go up to him and go ""On the way down I saw you and you saved me from myself"" or ""Oh my god have you talked to Ashlee lately, how's Jessica doing? Did she cheat in Nick?"" But instead I paid for my new Pumas and left, I think everyone's entitled to some privacy, even if you are a celebrity. (He's not even that famous anyways, if it were Jake Gyllenhaul, I'd be all up on that shit.)

On a completely different note, I was watching part of the SAG awards tonight and the award for best cast ensemble went to ""Crash"". It's weird when I think about the first time I saw this movie back in May, I walked out of the theater completely taken aback by its message about racism and its reflection on society. I saw ""Crash"" with Ryan right before the summer started. After the movie we sat and talked for a while about what it all meant - and when the movie came out on DVD I went out and bought it immediately, hoping to touch base with him again to see if the summer had changed any of our previous perceptions. Unfortunately Ryan passed away a few days later and I was never able to talk to him. 

So it is weird, random events on a rainy Sunday with nothing in common except for the fact I decided to write about them. Peace."

Although, I do find it funny looking back over my course of ""blogging"" how I have two years of my life basically documented. The happier times in my life, my disappointments, lots of laughter spread and even more tears shared, one or two moments of revelation and plenty of stupidity, all available for me to look back upon.

"event","<P>So... here we are again. Another year has passed; I am one more year older, maybe a little wiser, but definitely not 19 anymore. This is probably going to be one of those drawn out examinations of how my life has been going so far, so for the sake of saving space when y'all click your little friends tab I'll just cut this section, let's face it&nbsp;<lj user=""katyb_xox"" />&nbsp;is probably the only person reading this damn thing anyways. <lj-cut text=""But for those of you who have nothing better to do, enjoy:""> </P>
<P>I've never been a big fan of birthdays. Maybe it's because&nbsp;the date runs so&nbsp;close to the&nbsp;birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that <EM>my</EM> birthday over the years lost emphasis. Growing up in Oregon my family never threw me any&nbsp;birthday parties, my mom tried&nbsp;to surprise me&nbsp;for my 18th birthday, but by that time I had outgrown the celebration phase, maybe a little too old and&nbsp;a whole lot too cynical to really enjoy a party. So by the time I could drive I have basically been&nbsp;celebrating my birthdays in the same manner, alone for almost the entire day, I take the time to really ""reflect"" on my past year. The things I am proud of, my regrets (the regrets usually win) all come bubbling to the surface, released from that&nbsp;cage in my mind that I store them; this kind of truth scares the shit out of me. (I know what a waste of a perfectly good birthday wish)&nbsp;</P>
<P>2005 started out with such promise and anticipation. 2004 had to have been one of the worst years ever, what with the being sick for such a long time, and the depression, and the not liking my job, and the hating where I was in my life, nothing went right that year. So when it finally approached the end, I was so excited for the beginning of 2005 expecting that anything would be better than that crap I had just put up with, and knowing that I was taking the appropriate steps to place myself in a really good position to have a&nbsp;great year. </P>
<P>And it <EM>was</EM> a great year. Quitting my&nbsp;job at the law firm&nbsp;in the beginning of the year was one of my best decisions. It gave me time&nbsp;to enjoy being&nbsp;young and&nbsp;in college, and not always over doing things with school and work and mountains of responsibility. And in March I figured out that I am not this unfeeling droid incapable of having feelings or showing interest in another human being, it just takes the right type of guy to capture my attention. Even if that guy didn't reciprocate those feelings, I still am thankful for at least having the knowledge (thanks Jeremy). And I got involved with the HRC and really making the effort to understand myself and what it means to me to be gay and creating my own definition for the term away from the typical society/community image. I wanted to try and&nbsp;surround myself with positive influences, gay men that were&nbsp;intelligent, and successful, and using their time and resources to&nbsp;try to make an impact&nbsp;for the community, instead of looking up to this&nbsp;image of&nbsp;gay men with their six pack stomachs, their perfect smile, and attitude&nbsp;of&nbsp;sexual inhibition and emotional carelessness (I failed). </P>
<P>Time moves&nbsp;so quickly and before&nbsp;I could grasp what was happening, summer was approaching, and I am&nbsp;trying on&nbsp;my cap and gown for graduation, and four years of my life, four years that I dedicated to higher education and independence and discovery pass me by as I walk&nbsp;on stage in husky stadium&nbsp;to pick up my fake diploma on a rainy day in June. And thus began the summer. This amazing wonderful summer that I benchmark as one of the best,&nbsp;not because I went anywhere special (I stayed in Seattle the entire time), or&nbsp;because I met someone special (single as always), but because it was simple&nbsp;and carefree and full of laughter. I met&nbsp;some of the best new people during this time (Jake, Tristan, Sarah,&nbsp;Adam, Tiff),&nbsp;with a great mixture of partying and seeing friends, and spending time by myself with a good book and a towel&nbsp;at&nbsp;Madison&nbsp;Park. I miss it, terribly, the memories, the feeling of the sun on my face as I scoped out my surroundings, waking up at 10:30 in the afternoon and being greeted with a&nbsp;friendly IM. The only&nbsp;shadow during the entire time was my looming stress about not having a job, but it all worked out in the end, and if I knew then what I know now, I would go back and tell myself to live it up even more, enjoy the sunshine every second possible because the&nbsp;clouds will roll in soon and things would never be the same again.</P>
<P>September first greeted me with a new job and sunny days, but then... September 14th happened and my understanding of the world would never be the same. I know I've talked about his death a lot, and I am sorry. I figure y'all get it, I use the same&nbsp;description every time, losing&nbsp;that kind of&nbsp;presence, energy from this world, I still wake up and feel different. I know&nbsp;I should just get over it, move on and remember happier times, and I have tried, and I do, but it's hard especially when you carry around so much regret. After the memorial service, I went home and read his goodbye letter; maybe I shouldn't have, at least not so soon. In it, he describes feelings and pain that I had went through, that he and I had specifically spoken about in relating to my depression. During our countless coffees, lunches, and dinners, this topic would come up and I would talk about my own struggles and how I eventually (thought) I got over it, never&nbsp;once thinking that he might be going through the same thing. To me, he had it all, the looks, the money, the family and friends, the house, the car, the laughter, how could he possibly be feeling that way. <EM>But he did</EM>.&nbsp;And I regret, everyday I regret,&nbsp;that I didn't see it. I mean I should have recognized the signs right? I went through the exact same thing, with the same thoughts (the only difference&nbsp;I was too chicken to ever go through with it), I should have seen him pulling away, I should have listened more and talked less, I should have done something...&nbsp;I know he had his mind set, and there was probably nothing I could do or say to change that, but the regret is still there and it has&nbsp;changed me. </P>
<P>Ryan's&nbsp;death marked the end of summer and essentially the end of my ""innocence"".&nbsp;The person I was before&nbsp;September 14th seemed so young, I was in school, lacked responsibility, and carried myself in a very juvenile manner (I still do that one), even after graduating college my entire summer was spent dickin around. But starting in September I began my first, real, full-time, salary job, and I hadn't even been there for more than a week when I got that phone call saying that Ryan killed himself. Having to deal with the pain of losing someone you were so close to, having to try to collect yourself to just carry on through the day without breaking down, and having to say goodbye to someone I loved&nbsp;and admired so much, was probably the most adult thing&nbsp;I have and will ever have to do. Ryan's death forced me to grow up. That&nbsp;understanding of the world changed, obviously, and I had to reevaluate it now that it had crumbled and reform my&nbsp;globe with this new perspective. </P>
<P>His death has brought back a lot of my insecurities, and I know that was not the effect he would have&nbsp;wanted me to have. Part of the reason why I miss the summer so much,&nbsp;is because I miss that ""I don't give a fuck what you think of me"" attitude I had during that time. Now it seems that I am once again caught up in trying to gain acceptance from those who will never accept me. I understand that&nbsp;people&nbsp;don't like me; I am either too fake or too real for them to feel comfortable. I&nbsp;realize that people&nbsp;find me annoying, obtrusive, and way too loud. I recognize the fact that I am too quick to judge and not quick enough to take responsibility. But even with all of that, I don't think I am a bad person, why are people so eager to make me out to be one? I can't help that I care too much, that I am constantly sad over my friend, or that my feelings get bruised so easily, I can't help it as much as I try. In any case I am gonna try, for Ryan's sake, to be okay with things again. He&nbsp;once wrote to me&nbsp;""<SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">I hope I still know you when you're my age""&nbsp;</SPAN>well Ryan, in ten years, if I'm still around, I'll write you a little something to let you know how I've been, hopefully by then I will have learnt from both of our mistakes. </P>
<P>So like I said earlier, here we are again... The truth spilt out onto a stupid blog, too long to keep anyone's interest. Anyways the first two thirds&nbsp;of 2005 were awesome, some of the best memories of my life. The last third... I am adjusting, and it'll take some getting use to this whole ""adult"" thing, but here's to a good year anyways. Cheers.</P>

"event","Usually I don't pay much attention to the messages placed on any company's products, thinking it held little significance towards my life. But today, for whatever reason, I read the quote printed on the side of my Starbucks cup and it struck me as not only unabashedly honest but completely relevant to my life and the events that have taken place these past couple weeks. The quote under the title of, The Way I see It #43, read:

""My only regret about being gay is that I repressed it for so long. I surrendered my youth to the people I feared when I could have been out there loving someone. Don't make that mistake yourself. Life's too damn short."" -- Armistead Maupin

Wow, it is interesting how a quote on a side of a cup that's probably manufactured a million times around the world can come into my life at this time when I am faced with a similar situation and witnessing others going through the same experience. I have to believe that things happen for a reason, it might not make sense at the time you are going through it, but with patience and a little time down the road I hope that the fragments of emotions and questions and analyzing all finally come together. I am probably putting too much emphasis on a stupid quote on a cup, but maybe, just maybe there was a reason I got this cup today..."

<P>I think&nbsp;Southridge and Beaverton is missing out on an amazing&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;by not allowing the community to&nbsp;show&nbsp;The Laramie Project. It's a play that speaks about tolerance and accepting one another and the tragic death of a young man whose short life served so much meaning.

"event","I went to Timberline Spirits tonight for its finale, after tonight the bar closes its doors forever. I'd only been there once before and stayed like five minutes so I wanted to check things out before the bar went bye bye and the gays in Seattle will have to find a different place to congregate on Sundays nights. Well this being the final night the bar was PACKED it took us (me, Katie and her boyfriend Jag) like 15 minutes to get in the doors, once we got in it was so hot and sweaty we had to immediately switch to the other end of the bar where it was a little cooler. I wasn't going to drink since I have to be at work Monday morning for a staff meeting, but this was definitely a needing to get drunk situation. My ass got grabbed and I was touched so many times I was just getting angry, and it was so packed and I wasn't drunk I just did not have a good time. Even though I met up with my friend Tristan briefly, it was still just too much uncomfortability (I know it's not a word but just work with me here) for me that we left after being there for like 45 minutes.

"event","Couple quick blurbs:

- Got my contract info for my new job, woohoo. I had Mr. Clint Eddy, Attorney at Law, take a look over the information make sure I wasn't getting corn-holed over anything. It's nice to have lawyer friends :-) He gave me the green light I signed and faxed my acceptance letter back to HQ and will start work September 6th (day after Labor Day). I am excited but there are still some things I have to work out with the Seattle office I'll probably give them a call tomorrow.

- I have some car problems this weekend and so I took my baby to the Toyota dealership today. At the end of the day I shelled out over $400 dollars to get the damn thing fixed. New platinum spark plugs(?), air filter, drain and clean transmission fluid, and just the initial taking the damn car and getting it hooked up to their computer to figure out whats wrong cost $97. The car needed a check up though so I am glad I did it, the lady told me besides these couple problems for a car with this many miles it was in excellent condition, and after getting my car back it felt and drove a lot better. Money well spent I guess but 400 bones is a lot. I forgot how stressful and expensive it was to own a car. (My dad already said he would pay for half od the maintenance, I am hoping to talk to my mom and be like ""yeah I am running low on money I just had to spend 400 dollars on fixing my car"" and she will then cut me a check for half. Since my parents are divorce and hate each other so they never speak to one another I can basically get the repairs done with no money out my pocket and no one will be the wiser. Way to work the system David.)

- On top of all this Katie and I each bought new matching laptops. There was a sale going on at Office Depot so we got a great deal on them as well. The model is the HP zv6000 with a free printer, the base standard price after rebates for everything was $499.99, with any upgrades half off. Well we upgraded our hard drive, widescreen, battery, memory, and DVD/CD-RW burner. The final price ended up being $1054.11 up front, and then I have $400 dollars in rebates so in three months the actual final price for my laptop will be $654.11 which is a fuckin steal considering all the shit we are getting. The only hassle is keeping track of your rebates and making sure you don't get dicked over, but I am good with shit like this so I am not too worried. 

I think that's all for now I am pretty damn tired. Peace yall."

"event","<P>Now that I am officially employed my time spent dickin around on the Internet can be better utilized writing crap like this. Before when I was job searching it was 50% job hunting and 50% finding porn, now that things have change and I can devout more time to porn, bout 80%, and a good 20% updating this piece of crap and commenting on the rest of yall's stuff (I love porn, honestly there would be a HUGE void in my life if I didn't have Sean Cody and Corbin Fisher). </P>
<P>Now those of you that know me know that I loves me a good crap load of television. Reality, comedy, dramedy, whatever, as long as I can fill 30 minutes to an hour of my life entertained and vedged out I'm a happy camper (extra points if the show has a consistent amount of hot guys with their shirts off). So for this random piece of crap there are a few shows/networks that I wanted to especially <lj-cut text=""comment on the summer TV season"">.</P>
<P>Taking first place for the most entertaining network over the summer: MTV</P>
<P>I will admit that MTV has A LOT of misses on TV right now. The biggest and probably most obvious is <EM>My Sweet Sixteen</EM>. First off, all these bitches need to be shot and take their bloody corpses tie it to the back of a&nbsp;U-Haul van and drag it through town so&nbsp;everyone can throw rocks and shit at them. God I hate everything about this show, even though I know that if I were in high school I'd probably be friends with these spoiled brats (why? cause I am one) at least I have matured since those days and have realized the error in their perception of the world. The girl&nbsp;that irks me the most... the fat bitch that kept calling herself a diva. Listen honey, Whitney, Mariah, Aretha, even Celine, they are divas, they have earned the title of Diva, they even have a hit concert on VH1 to fuckin prove it. You Miss Thang are NO DIVA, you are just a fat annoying bitch who has to buy friendships and you will be unsatisfied the rest of your life.</P>
<P>The network also fails with shows like <EM>Trailer Fabulous</EM> (you can dress a fat person up all you want in ribbons and bows but at the end of the day they are still huge, you can try to make fancy a trailer as much as possible but at the end of the show the thing is still a trailer, and the people on your show are still poor, and generally unattractive), and Wild 'N Out (hood bitch what? This is suppose to be funny?) But why MTV gets a first place finish for the summer television watching...</P>
<P><IMG height=221 src=""http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/421584313/1.jpg"" width=425>&nbsp;<EM><STRONG>LAGUNA BEACH!</STRONG></EM></P>
<P>Okay have you ever gone out to eat and thought to yourself ""All I really want is chocolate cake, chocolate cake sounds so good right now"" and when it finally arrives and you take that first bite it tastes and feels so much better than you could have ever thought. And each bite gets better and better that you just want to take off your clothes and roll around naked in the confectionery rubbing everything against your body and genitals and basking in its decadence... That is how I feel about <EM>Laguna Beach. </EM>The petty drama, the ridiculously attractive white people, the back stabbing, the heart break, well its all I can do from just wetting myself right now. This season is even better than the first because Kristen is now the feature character and that skank LC is a big loser like I called it last year. And plus this season's cast is <STRONG>WAY</STRONG> more attractive then last years, mainly because they limited the fat brunette role to just one girl (peace out Christina and Morgan may you finally discover that your love for each other is more than just a friendship one day) and at least this fat brunette is kinda skanky and looking to steal boyfriends. And Kristen, I love her, if&nbsp;I were a 17 year old girl I'd want&nbsp;to&nbsp;be her, I want to be her homo best friend and feel her big ol boobs all day.</P>
<P>MTV also scores points with the new season of <EM>The Real World</EM>. This cast is definitely a step up of and of the past five previous shows. All within&nbsp;three episodes Danny gets his face bashed in, goes through surgery, recovers and goes out partying and the next day (Valentines Day) finds out his mom has died. I was crying throughout the entire damn thing it was so sad. What's next for the poor guy ""I'm sorry to inform you of this Danny but you have contracted a flesh eating bacteria that will slowly devour your remnants"" the damn show knows how to pulls at your emotional strings I'm telling you. And I still love all the MTV dating shows like <EM>Date My Mom</EM>, and <EM>Next </EM>which&nbsp;I find embarrassing and incredibly cheesy.</P>
<P>A close close runner up to MTV is Bravo. The gayest network on TV has finally backed it up with some quality crazy programming. The best of the best is <EM>Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List </EM>which basically is Kathy's shameless attempt to pawn her DVD and get free shit, and I&nbsp;revel in&nbsp;every second of it. You gotta appreciate a chick that loves her homos and is not afraid to announce that she is a hag and proud of the fact. A lot of my friends find her utterly annoying, I find her delightful and hilarious and very comforting.</P>
<P>Then there is <EM>Being Bobby Brown</EM>&nbsp;the craziest shit I have seen in a long time. I sometimes wonder what compels crazy people to allow cameras to follow them around and tape them, do they think that they are not crazy and that by allowing the American public into their everyday lives that our perception will change? Whitney, Whitney, Whitney, I love you dear, your voice still resonates as one of the greatest voices of all time, but when you told Bobby to take you in the woods and fuck you, I don't know that was a little too much for me. I do feel sorry for them though, where ever the family goes they are barraged by pictures and autograph seekers, especially Whitney who has solidified her fame, Bobby's public image needs some help so he's takin whatever picture her can take thats not a mug shot. The real victim in this story, their daughter Bobby Christina, the poor girl is gonna need so much therapy from having two crazy parents (not to mention the eating disorder she is sure to develop in a few years unless she drops some pounds immediately). Their crazy lives brings a smile to my face.</P>
<P>Well that is the summer TV wrap up. Basically besides <EM>Laguna Beach</EM> and <EM>Kathy Griffin</EM> this summer TV season has licked balls. Luckily the new fall season starts very soon and you know what that means... New <EM>America's Next Top Model, Veronica Mars, Will &amp; Grace, and American Idol</EM>. Oh television how you make my life seem so pathetic at times, what would&nbsp;I do without you. Peace.</P><lj-cut>"

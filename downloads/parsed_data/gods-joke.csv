"event","He tore apart my bathroom, took away all my razors, my beautiful box of solutions. He threw them all away.....he can't fucking talk to me about!! BUT HE CAN TEAR EVERYTHING APART AND TAKE AWAY THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS ME SANE!! AND THE FUCKING COWARD HAS TO WAIT UNTIL I AM GONE!!! Until i am at work and the garbage gets picked up before i can get them back.

So what did i do?

14 deep cuts into my arm to say a wonderful FUCK YOU to my father. 

thanks dad...i feel much better now."

"event","I came home last night from work. Well, really this morning since i work until 2am. I was stressed from the previously mentioned incident, emotionally on edge, and physically my head was in so much pain i was near tears. And i come to my computer to check my messages, and there is a note ""Clean your room by tomorrow afternoon"". And i lost it. Like, they know how frazzled i am, how fucking on edge, and all that matters to them is my god damn room being clean. So i lost it. I wrote a long message back, telling them about the cutting, the suicidal thoughts that won't leave me alone...and i left it on the Kitchen counter. This morning i woke to two notes, one from my mother, and one from my father. i read them, and concluded one thing....THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND A FUCKING WORD I WROTE! My father's note was pretty much telling me how ungrateful i am but he is so proud of me for doing well in school (WHICH HE FUCKING KNOWS I'M NOT...so just more guilt there). my mother's note, while not so bad was her typical responce. She listed out bits of advice she had learned over the years, recycled words of hope that were empty by now. It made me feel sick.

I've near starved myself all day. i refused to even eat anything until 3pm. The hunger pain was good. 11 days until the David Bowie concert....57 until the next Harry Potter movie. 

Hope i make it to both...."

"event","I had been fighting with my father. He walsk in the door and just yells. About everything. And he finished it off with, why the hell aren't you in school. and i screamed back that i was on spring break,a nd maybe if he took two seconds to pay attention to my life, he would have known that. He just ignored me, and when he does talk to me, its always vicious. nothing i do is right. and when i do one thing right, there is something else i am doing wrong.  And then when he notices i am slipping, he tried to cram in some time on the weekends like that can make up for it alll. A quick fix.

So the yelling, then i ended up in the bathroom and a few cuts later, i was quiet again. But, it didn't end there like it normally does. I was washing my face, watching myself in the mirror as i held the washcloth> And then i was covering my mouth and nose...and i was holding it so tightly. I  bent down and closed my eyes. I could feel my lungs trying to suck as much air as they could through both washcloth and my hands. When i opened my eyes, iw as bent over and i stared down into the sink. When i finally pulled the washcloth away, my lips were blue and i was so dizzy that i just fell to the floor.

It's maybe two hours later. My head is killing me and my throat is so sore.

It's been so long since i have done anything like that. It's scary...i know i'm getting worse.

i got my insurance card yesterday. Not that i think it will help, but i think it's time i go back to therapy of some sort."

"event","I can't tell how i feel. i guess my parents tried to talk to me today. i think they can tell something is wrong, but i just get angry. They go about it wrong. I told my mother i was lonely because i miss out on so many group functions because i am at work. And she pretty much said it was my own fault and well, that wasnt the comforting parenting i needed. I don't know what i am feeling. Part of my just wants to sink into a hot bath and bleed for a while. The other part wants to leave the house, just drive and sing and cry. Another part just wants to sit outside (but its too cold so fuck that part). I just wish i knew what would help. What would make me feel better. because i am have no clue what i want or need.

I just still want to dissapear. Close my eyes, count to 10, and dissapear."

"event","I hate living in Roseville. I'm so far away from my friends. And when they plan to do something, i'm always working. It's taking it's toll. Maybe i should just let go. Because i hate the feeling of hearing what everyone else has been doing. Or Melissa saying ""we are havign a big bon fire"" and i get happy because i get to see friends, and then she says it's on a sat, and i work...and i wish she just hadn't tol me at all.

It's hard working this shift 5:30-2am. Because i'm at home when everyone is at work, and i am at work when everyone is home. I wake up to an empty house, i come home to an empty house. Maybe that isn't helping the recent overwhelming depression.

It doesn't matter. Thats life. Alone. Fun."

"event","I wrote a bad email to Daniel. Just venting, crying, yelling. Fuck me, fuck him. I get so mad at him, but i think really i am just mad at myself. He's overseas and just wants me to write, to tell him i love him. But i don't. And i don't want to lie. Because he'll come back here to nothing. But instead of writing and telling him about my day like he wants to hear, i just close my eyes and let the days pass by. Then he writes, pissed off at me for not talking to him. And i yell back because i think he is being so selfish. but actually, remember, just mad at myself for not being his perfect pen pal. *sighs* does any of this make sense? 

He called today, but i left my phone at home. So he left this voice mail that just said one word ""Typical"". And i was so angry. What does that mean? I'm flakey. Thats what it means. That he thinks i am some unreliable whore. And i am.

Whats on my cubicle tonight.

3 books: ""Shadow and Light"": given to me by Nick's brother for Xmas. ""Harry Potter"": The first one which is silly because i read the second one, then the third one, now the first? huh? ""Thinking in Writing"": because i am supposed to be reading the essays in it so i can write my next essay. nah.

"event","I don't know why i treat Greg the way that i do. I love him endlessly, and i am so overly protective of him...but i also get angry at him. He called to tell me to cheer up...and i snapped. It rubbed me in such an awful way, like i was angry that i was expected to prance around as Mary Fucking Sunshine. Like i have some switch i can just flip on. Like i should just shut up and act like there isn't a problem, when there is. But...i know he was just looking out for me. And maybe i just took it badly because i am on my period and thusly really sensitive.

"event","Suicide. I have been suicidal since junior high. Thats a long time. But the idea of it was always just that...an idea. I've stood on my fair share of ledges with arms outstreched, wondering...what if i just fell? I've had the pills in my mouth, the razor to my wrist. But even then, it was just an idea.

For the past few months, it's moved from those shadows. I'm terrified at how real the idea now seems. So less an idea now, more of purpose. Something that can and should be and will be accomplished. I can't see my future anymore. i can't see myself years, or even months from now. There is so much i don't want to leave behind...and there is so much fear for what may wait at the end of the suicide trail. But at least 70% of each day, and usually more, is spend considering this final alternative. I'm doing so poorly in school...and i can't bare the thought of facing my parents...AGAIN..or failing...AGAIN...and this was it. The last chance. What happens after this, is nothing but bad. I wish i could just run, run and dissapear. But since i can't...there is only one other way to make it all go away. How can someone live like this? In pain all the time? Crying ALL THE TIME? I don't think anyone knows how serious i am. How sincerely at the end of my rope i am. I could tell my parents. i could break down sobbing and say I AM GOING TO KILL MYSELF! and they would just roll their eyes. How do i know? because it's happened before. 

the next few months are going to be hard....and i don't know if i will make it out this time.

so i think i should start tying up some lose ends. Just in case."

"event","Today has been tolerable. Brian and i went to eat at Daphne's (a local and wonderful Greek resturant/cafe). Then we cruised by some apartment longingly and then wandered the mall rather aimlessly. We parted ways as i had class to attend to. This is the class i actually enjoy going to. Not because of the subject or work, but because i really admire this professor. She's sort of like, how i would like to see myself years from now. On the way to class however, i gave myself three cuts on my wrist. I don't really even know why save a sudden frantic need. Watching them bleed was very calming, as was wrapping them in beautifully pure white gauze. Class got out very early, and i spent the next hour or so just talking with the previously mentioned interesting instructor. It was nice. Just talking. She knows about the cutting, and i think i like that she doesn't see that as a sign of being broken. I certainly don't think she condones it, but i think she understands it. Most people i meet see that, and i think i am either fucked up or just angsty. However, she does see me as very intelligent. i dont know why it makes me so uncomfortable for people to say or think that. Don't i want that? To be thought of as intelligent? i know why...

when i turned in my last essay, it was crap. i didn't want to sign my name to it let alone turn it in. But i did, and got it back with an A. I was so angry. i wanted to take it back to her and say, NO, this is not an A paper. It is crap! DON'T YOU SEE THAT! Grade it again because it doesn't desearve the A! maybe thats what its like. i don't think i really am intelligent. I think maybe i am, less blided by society than some. I think i know some big words and can string a sentence. i believe i can think for myself. But intelligent? No. And i value her opinion, and by having her see me as intelligent...i feel like i am lying to her. And i don't want to tlie to her. So durring most of the conversation i wanted to cry. To cry and say why don't you see i am not who everyone thinks i am?  I'm a shame. A lie. Maybe i had hoped she would see through me, and now feel that she did not. And i'm just another poser. A child walking around in heels and smeared lipstick, trying to play grown-up.

So now it's off to work. But first i have to once again rumage for a long sleeve shirt. Sometimes i wonder what would happen if i walked into work, all those born again Christians, with my cuts climbing my arm like harp strings. How many would want to save me, fix me? How many would shun me?

Oh well. Time to put on my pretty smile and dance for the camera."

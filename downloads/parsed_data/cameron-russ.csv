"event","Cameron has decided his favorite book in the whole world is ""Goodnight Moon"".  He calls it Ah-Moo.  We know it is his favorite book because he is carrying it around the house from room to room.  He has given it to me to read to him at least 5 times today.  I haven't asked Ben how many times he was asked yet.  He is partial to Moo, Baa, La La La by Sandra Boynton but it does not get the preferential treatment of being carried about the house.  Today he also wanted to take ""Tumble Bumble"" around as well.  

At one point he looked at his  book and then gave it a big smooch.   

For some reason - he has also adopted a polar bear toy.  It is one of like 25 animals in a set - its only  2 or 3 inches tall.  He picks that one out every time and gives it a hug.  He's a nut."

"event","So, it has been forever since I have updated Cameron's  journal.  I will try to backdate some things later but for now I will start from here:

Cameron is finally having a verbal boom.  It was the next big worry on our list.  Supposedly, 18 mos olds should have about 20 words.  We aren't at 20 yet but we have made a huge increase in the last two weeks.  

Words before: Mama, Dada, Juice, Bye-Bye, Dah (down), Bah (bite)
Words after:  Mommy, Daddy, Juice, Bye-Bye, Dah(down), Bah (bite), Archie, Choo-Choo, Ka-Boo (peek-a-boo), GO! (go is used for an attempt to run like brother), Uh-Uh (up)

We're thrilled about the verbal increase in such a short time.  He still doesn't have a good name for Mason aka brother.  We have tried to get him to say brother or Mason - he seems shy to say either.  Tonight I said Bubby- and he seemed like he was using that but that just strikes me as darn funny.  

One of the most striking differences between the kids is Cameron's stubborn streak and temper.  When he is mad he wants to SHARE it with the whole world.  If you tell him NO! He will come over and hit you.  If he can' hit you he will try to claw you and scratch you, if he is REALLY mad - he may  even try to bite you.  Yeah, I can't wait until he is really strong.   I haven't even mentioned how he will fall to the floor and literally have a fit, kicking and yelling.  He will plow his whole body forward to be angry.  So needless to say he has had some unintentional further injury happen to him through the process of having the fit to begin with.  

Tonight - I am going to hope he isn't scarred for life. He decided to have a fit in the bathtub because I had to have the washcloth he was playing with the scrub him down.  The child was in a seated position and literally pushed his head into the water as if to touch his forehead to his toes and it really took him about 30 seconds to realize he was not going to be able to inhale from there.  I felt awful for him, but you would think that he would start to piece that the falling forward thing just does not work.  I couldn't help but giggle just a tiny bit after I knew he was safe.  

...and lest I forget - God help you if you try to wipe his nose.  That little bugger can channel Thor for that defense.

"event","Herein I will finally stop my brain panic when I  try to figure out what to call these updates.  Cameron turns 8 months old tomorrow - but I  can't really do an 8 month update when he just TURNED 8 months.  So, this update is for months six and seven.  

These last two months have been such a roller coaster ride.  At Cam's 6 month checkup the doc informed us that he seemed to be low tone in his legs and told us to buy him a johnny jump up to try to  get him to use his legs.  It didn't work and we started physical therapy. After our initial PT visit I proceeded to freak out and panic about what was wrong with our child.  We spent the next 4 weeks white knuckling the steering wheel at every turn.  We had Cam evaluated by the  early intervention program in our county which made us  breathe a bit of relief.  Cameron does have a gross motor delay, but his cognitive skills seem just fine and he is making improvements week by week with his therapy - you would never know a thing was wrong with him to look at him.  

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/cam-7months/IMG_2262.sized.jpg"" title="""">
FOOD
We started solid foods just before the six month birthday and we have now made  lots of headway into the stage two foods - we haven't found a thing that Cameron doesn't like AND we haven't had him refuse food either.  I've never hit 'full' with him.  He complains vehemently once he realizes that yes, it is meal time and YOU HAVE  NOT GOTTEN THAT FOOD IN MY MOUTH YET. 

All of his prior eating issues have gone.  His thrust reflex is gone.  The hardest time we have is that sometimes he is so busy watching everything around him like, Mason, Archie or the cats - that he really could care less about that bite of food.  He has also developed the orange nose that Mason had as  well when he was on baby food.  

We just started him  on those puff finger food and he loves it - I think he loves  feeding himself more than anything else.  We also started cheerios.  All the finger foods give us buying time at dinner when we need to distract him so I  can cook.

TOOFERS
WE HAVE TEETH!!! Finally!  That little boy cut his two bottom teeth - the first one came in 2 weeks ago and the second one is here now as well.  His little cyst in his mouth is agitated from the teeth - tonight it was blue/purple color.  Maybe it will finally pop on its own.  

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/cam-7months/IMG_2248.sized.jpg"" title="""">
DADADA
Our little boy is officially babbling and I LOVE hearing him talk.  He really likes to talk to his bunny in his crib when he wakes up from a nap - and it is so gosh darn cute.  He was saying La-La-La and Ya-Ya-Ya for several weeks and the last week has brought a definitive DA DA DA!!!! My worries about him being speech delayed are quickly eroding - oh how we moms like to worry.

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/cam-7months/IMG_2246.sized.jpg"" title="""">
MOVEMENT
Cam can pull  up to a standing position if you hold his hands.  His hips are still wiggly but we are working on  strengthening his hips and his arms these days.  His legs are getting really strong and he really loves his jumper now.  He will work to get things out of reach and may fall over on his belly.  He can sit up pretty well  now but has no interest in pulling to  standing using objects.  His in home PT started last week and even she said that Cam was a laid back child.  We have an appt at Duke Childrens Center with a neurologist just to be safe- the appointment is at the end of May.

SLEEPING
We moved Cameron to his crib a few weeks ago.  I  was  beginning to suspect that I was disturbing his  sleep by moving around too much and sure enough - we moved him to his crib and he slept through til 5 am the first night and most days sleeps through til 7 - 7:30.  He adjusted just fine.  Ben and I were both rather shocked about it.  It was much more difficult with Mason.  

VAX
I am trying to research delaying the rest  of Cam's vaccinations based on his health issues.  There is so much info out there my brain wants to spin - but I feel its the right decision for him.  

MASON 
Mason still seems to really love his brother and is so good with  him.  Cameron still is so excited to see Mason every day.  Mason has been trying to fill that space  in our bed  that Cameron left - hopefully he'll get over this phase soon.  

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/cam-7months/IMG_2258.sized.jpg"" title="""">
NANNY/PLAYMATE
I hired a sitter/nanny who is a 23 year old mom to a boy who is one  month younger than Cam.  She works here about 10-12 hours a week and seems to really enjoy all the differences between the two babes.  Cam is a cuddlier baby and hers is not.  We're still adjusting but I think we might have a pretty good fit here and I am pleased about  that.  

SIGN
We just started attempting some signs  with him and I think he has picked up a modified one for Momma.  It is so nice to start that communication process where he can tell us what he wants. 

NURSING 
We're still breastfeeding and going strong.  Occasionally I  can coax Cam into holding my finger while he  nurses but many times he wants to press on my breast- it reminds  me of the way kittens nurse their mothers.  I try to interrupt him from doing that but he is very determined that this  is the way breastfeeding must be done.

"event","Our little boy is now half a year old.  I am shocked that it has been that long already

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/cam-6month/IMG_2185.jpg"">



Cameron just started baby squawking/screeching.  I am pleased to hear these sounds and I am so glad that I do not have a migraine every time I hear that sound because WOW is it loud!  He has also started to bang things despite the fact that there is nothing to really bang them on to when you are lying flat on your back.  

<lj-embed id=""1"" />

This month Cameron decided to completely reverse almost everything I knew to be true.  He went from sleeping a 3 hour nap and a 2 hour nap to this smorgasboard of naps.  Occasionally he'll nap for 2 hours in the morning, or he might only nap for 1 hour.  I was so confused that I actually broke out the spreadsheets to start tracking the progress to see if I could find a pattern.  Yes , yes this is a geek family.  We were entirely baffled as to what was going on with him.  It could be a growth spurt, it could be teething, it could even be that he was approaching a milestone.  To this day - and by that I mean all of two weeks later - I still can't tell you what happened.  Regardless, we started you on solid foods hoping that if nothing else you might sleep longer.  Starting you on solids changed nothing except the frequency and thickness of your poop.  It also increased my laundry.  

I started him out on some applesauce and he kept shaking like it was the most tart thing he had ever tasted.  To be fair, it WAS the most tart.  However, Cam eventually came to stop shaking every time we gave him a spoonful.  We then migrated to pears and that involved no shaking.  Bananas came into play - those were the easiest.  I tried peaches but Cam started doing the shiver shake again and I decided to just stick to what we knew.  By this time he got so gummed up over the weekend I had to withhold solids for 2 days so his digestive tract could get moving again.  

Feeding Cameron is a bit of a challenge because he still hasn't given up the thrust reflux yet - but he does enjoy the food.  So, half the time the food is on the bib or on his face.  He seems happiest when we let him suck the food off the spoon.  

Cameron is definitely struggling to reach ANYTHING in his path.  I have to really watch out when I am holding him because he will start to lean for something and well..let's face it - he's heavy! His hands are constantly 'raking' for items.  

We had to move Cam out of his infant car seat and into a convertible seat.  Our current one had a height max of 26 inches and 20 lbs.  His feet were hanging over the end.  He is pushing out of the 6 month clothes we had - they are pretty snug and we are definitely into 9 month old territory here.  I'll be glad when he starts sitting up more so we can get him more mobile.  

Developmentally I am worried - but not SCARED worried yet.  We have been ordered by the doc to work with him more on strengthening the leg muscles and getting him sitting up at least to tripod.  Cam has only just begun to discover the feet in the last 2 weeks.  He really enjoys playing with the socks until he pulls them off.  On the developmental milestones chart they ask if the baby is putting toes in their mouths.  All I can say is that for Cam to get his toes in his mouth is a MAJOR accomplishment.  There is a lot of CHUB in the way.  

This month also brought about awareness of the mouth.  Cameron has been sucking on his tongue and his lower lip.  He also started blowing raspberries.  Occasionally we can get a game going back and forth of blowing raspberries.  

Cameron is still co-sleeping with us - and he ONLY wants mommy when going to sleep at night.  It is amazing to me how great this kid is about going down for naps, but he KNOWS when it is bedtime and there MUST be a MOMMY and a BOOB thankyouverymuch.  It worries me about leaving him with sitters, and as a result there are very few people I trust him with.  

Alas, this month Cam got his very first cold thanks to Mommy.  He slept much better when propped up on a pillow. He also HATES the aspirator (aka booger bulb).  

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/cam-6month/IMG_2187.jpg"">

Finally, this month has brought us much laughter.  Cameron laughs so hard at his brother that it will bring tears to your eyes.  Cameron had the audience at the Montessori school open house laughing because for SOME reason - touching Mason's hair was the funniest thing EVER.  Of course, it is now distressing to Mason that he cannot get Cameron to laugh ON CUE.

"event","I missed Cameron's 4 month update due to all the crazy holiday schedule.  At least, that is my story and I am sticking to it.
 <img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/2007thanksgiving/DSC02696.sized.jpg"">


SLEEP
So, in the last two months we've seen some major progress.  Cameron has put himself to sleep a few times.  For me that means I have laid him down when he was awake and very sleepy and he went to sleep on his own.  This was not the norm we are used to because Mason could not get to sleep without us until we forced him to.  Most days Cam will take a 3 hour nap and maybe a 2 hour nap.  On other days we'll have these horrible one hour awake and one hour asleep days that I swear will turn my hair gray.  

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/2007-christmas/IMG_2084.jpg"">

LEGS! 
Cameron's favorite places to kick his legs are on his changing table and in his bouncy chair.  Why those places spark the leg kicking is beyond me.  The other day I was laughing hysterically at him because he would put ONE leg straight up in the air in his car seat.  No rhyme, no reason, and certainly no purpose were involved.  Just a leg up in the air.  

GRABBING
Oh how the grabbing has begun.  I mean he's been grabbing things on his little gyms for awhile but now there is this chutzpah behind the grab.  It is as if he'd snatch it out of your hands if only those darn arms would work faster.  Everything of course goes straight to the mouth- but God forbid it be anything plastic.  We still really don't like plastic in our mouths - but stuffed animals and blankets are big hits.  

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/2007-christmas/IMG_2032_001.jpg"">

TEMPERAMENTAL TICKLES
Ben had me convinced for years that he was ticklish.  Two years in - he gave up the facade and forever broke my heart.  I think Cam has inherited this trait.  I can tickle the dickens out of him and he will GUFFAW sometimes.  Then, I try to show daddy how to tickle him and NOTHING, NADA, ZIP.  It is as if the world is conspiring early to prove how crazy I am - or maybe it is how crazy I have yet to become.  

BREAKING THE BOOB
Cameron has started to REQUIRE boobie to go back to sleep at night.  Which is a big pain when it is 4-5 times a night and he isn't even eating.  He is literally asleep 1 minute after the boob is in his mouth.  My efforts to convince him that I am not the boob buffet aren't going well.  We went through a similar bout with Mason which ended up with Mason moving to the crib at 6 months old.  We are starting to put him down to sleep in his bed at night and unfortunately, yes - there is some crying involved.  I can't let it go more than 15 minutes.  Tonight he fell asleep before the 2nd round was up.  

THANKSGIVING
We had our first vacation as a family of four when we drove to PA for Thanksgiving.  We saw lots of family that we hadn't seen in 2 years and we marveled at how big all the kids are now.  Cameron received lots of praise for being such a good baby.  

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/2007thanksgiving/DSC02730.sized.jpg"">

CHRISTMAS
For the Christmas holiday we darted over to Western NC to meet up with Ben's mom and step-dad.  Ben's mom bought tickets for us all to ride the 'Polar Express'.  Mason was enthralled while Cameron took the opportunity to nap.  Regardless, Grandma was so glad to hold our little turkey.  Santa was good to the boys this year and mom and dad contributed as well.  Cameron received some baby gear and we've been using it every day.  
Christmas gifts.  The boys received some movies for Christmas and thankfully, Mason still enjoys the Baby Einstein series.  Cameron is really enjoying that movie and it is cute to see the boys watch it together.

SANTA! 
We waited too long to go see Santa and ended up at the mall the very last Sunday before Christmas.  Due to a snafu - the line would take almost 2 hours.  We were sitting on the floor nursing in the middle of the mall.  I don't know if anyone scowled at me, I didn't look to see.  5 minutes before we were actually about to see Santa - Cameron falls asleep and looks like a deer caught in headlights when they snap the picture.  Ah well - there is always next year. 

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/2007-christmas/mason_cameron_santa_christmas_2007.jpg"">

DISLIKES 
The one thing that will make Cameron cry every time is people who smoke trying to say hi to him.  I mean he will full out CRY immediately as if you kicked him in the gut.  I hope this continues through adulthood.  


SITTING UP
Right now Cam is still so big it is hard for him to sit up.  We did discover this past weekend that he CAN sit up while assisted with the boppy and some toys.  So, it is up to us now to really get his practice in.  He's just so darn chunky and REALLY wants to eat his hands!  Going for the hands just insures that child will topple over immediately.  

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/5-months/IMG_2130.jpg"">

POOP!
Cam's digestive tract is a mystery to me.  Lately he has gone on a poop strike.  No poop for 2-3 days and then he'll unleash the beast and send me running for the laundry as fast as I can.  I won't even get into the stench.  How two boys can be SO DIFFERENT AT EVERY TURN is just amazing to me.  I'm positive Cameron is at or over 19 lbs now, this boy does NOT need to be holding in his poop! 

I'm so torn between enjoying his babyness and wanting him to hurry up and sit up.  I keep fighting this internal battle between savoring his sweet smell and those sweet gummy smiles with the frustration of having to do everything for him all of the time - and his weight is seriously about to put me back into chiropractic care.  

MASON 
Big brother Mason is such a big hit - Cameron will almost become a contortionist trying to strain to see his big brother and what he is doing.  It is really cute and Cameron gets all spazzy and smiley when he first sees Mason in the morning.  Mason is so good about sitting with Cameron and keeping him company while we cook or run to the other room.  In my heart I pray they are bonding - Mason seems to enjoy Cameron in spurts and he tells us that he loves Cameron.  I think it also helps that at his daycare everyone wants to see Cameron so Mason feels like he has something special when he gets Cameron by himself.  
<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/2007-christmas/IMG_2079.jpg"">

BATHING 
It seems the only way we can consistently get Cam a bath is if we put him in his infant tub IN the big tub with Mason at Mason's bath time.  I think this is another reason why we really want Cam to be able to sit up.  Bath time is really hard right now.  Mason however enjoys <strike>dumping</strike> pouring water on his brother.  Hopefully, Ben's back will last long enough through all of next several years of bathing. 

We really have a great family - and a great life.  We are so blessed."

"event","This last month has really been wonderful.  Cameron is SUCH a good baby.  I am so afraid to write that out, because you just never know when your child will prove you wrong, but there - I said it.  Cam started to get into a semblance of a routine this month.  He gets up with the family around 7:30 - 8 am and is back to sleep 1-1.5 hours later.  He typically sleeps about 3 hours.  Then we sort of each lunch together, in turns anyway.  He plays in his play gym while I eat my lunch.  We talk and coo for a bit and after another 1-1.5 hours of this - he is ready to go back to sleep.  Some days he sleeps for an hour, other days he sleeps for 2 and there are many days where he may be awake longer, and I end up having to wake him up so we can go get his brother.  At night time, he is really ready to get to sleep by 9 and stay in bed.  He really prefers nursing to sleep for this round.  He will stay asleep til midnight or 1 am and then we're back on the every 3 -4 hours feeding in the middle of the night.  At the beginning of the month he was stretching out to 4 and 5 hours but that isn't happening these days.  Amazingly, he doesn't really mind being wet and isn't terribly wet for the 3-4 am feeding so I usually let him stay a little wet and let Daddy sleep in til the next feeding.  

We have had such laughter from Cam this month!.  He is such a giggle box.  It still just makes my heart soar to hear him laugh.  At the 2 month mark he wasn't even smiling and was about to give me heart failure for fear he had early signs of autism.  This last month has brought us a plethora of smiles, giggles and coos.  All the wonderful things of having a baby.  

Cameron is reaching for things and gripping them. He especially loves that new play gym, AND his thumb.  

This week we have noticed that Cam is starting to make conversation or contribute to the conversation.  He has these groans that he does that just drone on and on for a good 5-10 minutes.  I don't know who he is talking to, or complaining too - but I will bet you that he talks earlier than Mason does, and talks a LOT more.  

I cannot believe what a Chunky Monkey this kid is.  Seriously - he's the perfect baby chunk.  I have to find new nicknames for him because I am using Mason's nicknames and Mason is not amused.  Mason informed us that HE is cutie-pie and so we have had to rename Cameron to ""sweetie-pie"".  Mason has always been my pumpkin - so now I am going to have to train myself to call Cameron - Dumplin'.  Lately, I've just been glad when I got their NAME right. 

This month we are driving Cameron to PA to introduce him to all the extended family on Ben's side.  I hope he acclimates well.  My hairdresser scared the bejeezus out of him this week."

The all impressive clenched right fist is his attempt to master his own destiny.  This is the hand/thumb that he is determined to fit into his mouth.  You can see him concentrating so hard on WILLING that hand to move to his mouth.  He will get SO close to getting it to his mouth and then it shoots straight back up in the air.  He will occasionally let out a frustrated yell which of course, cracks me up.

His 3 month update will come next week.  This child actually LAUGHED for the first time last night and had us in stitches.  He is still learning how to laugh so the noises that come out are funnier than normal.  I can't wait to post that video.  We have to move the firewire card to my PC.  

Here is a full view of Cameron so you can see how big he is getting.  He is my chunky monkey.

These last few weeks have been interesting from a mommy 2nd time around perspective.  With Mason I loved every moment and was content to hang out on the sofa with him in my arms for hours.  

Not so with Cameron.  
For starters, you just cannot linger around the house all day with number two.  Dishes need getting done, groceries must be bought, and this time, I still have clients that I am working with so work must get done.  Plus, Cameron really does not seem to enjoy an extended sleep in mommy's arms.  To be truthful, he'll crash out in Daddy's arms for a good hour or two, but with me?  With me he'll fall asleep and then startle awake again several minutes later.  

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/2months/IMG_1695.jpg"" align=""Left"">This scenario only holds true on the sofa.  We are cosleeping with Cameron.  In our family bed, that kid will snooze.  For two months I had him in a contraption that would allow him to sleep on his side while being supported so that he does not roll in either direction.  I gave that up this week.  He doesn't really like it and one of its few advantages was that it would prop his pacifier just a BIT but not enough to last before he fell completely asleep.  Plus, he really started complaining about being on his side.  This kid really loves sleeping on his belly.  He loves it so much, that he damn near gave me heart failure when he slept SIX HOURS straight the other night.  I thought it might have been a fluke but nope, he slept another 5 last night.  I love that we are blessed with a child that gives his old worn down parents some decent sleep.  On top of all of it, he really isn't peeing a lot during that snooze fest and so we can skip the middle of the night diaper change too.  All of this at 9 weeks - I would have never believed it. 

We are falling into a semblance of a routine and it is really allowing me to get more done in the last day or so.  I hope I have not jinxed my life but typing those very words.  In fact, I'm bracing myself as I type. I am still shocked that he isn't awake longer during the day - but maybe after we get this sleep pattern thing really down - I'll have a better idea of when he wants to be awake.  

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/brothers/IMG_1664.jpg"" >
Mason is still very sweet with Cameron and says ""Mommy, I love Cameron"" at least once a day.  Cameron almost smiled at Mason tonight and that made my heart swell.  His smile makes me want to break down in tears with joy.  Especially since just over a week ago I was almost paralyzed with fear that he had early signs of autism.  Yes, I am a nut - I know this.  

Cameron really smiled big at Daddy tonight and I think Daddy was almost bowled over by that gummy grin. The coos are few and far between but they are slowly easing into our lives and I am so thankful for those coos when I hear them.  We've been so used to hearing grunts and moans for the last two months - to hear some joy from Cameron just makes you realize why you thought having a second child was a good idea in the first place.  

If I haven't mentioned it yet - our poor Cameron is a snorter.  He snorts when he is really mad.  If this continues he will surely be scarred from us laughing at his temper.  We should start saving for that mental health fund now."

I suppose the first month of adjusting to a newborn baby is the hardest - and the same was true for us at the house.  So many things are different for Cameron than they were for Mason.  We barely left the house with Mason his first month and I think Cameron has been out every single day for something.  He is a pack n' go baby for sure. 




























 Cameron started off nursing for only about 10 minutes tops and now he is nusring anywhere from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.  He is truly the chow hound.  I know this because I took him to the doctor this week to get something looked at and he already weighed 11 lbs 14 oz (with a diaper on).  Cameron is definitely more chunky than Mason.  He looks like he is going to be a TANK when he grows up.

Apparently all our kids get the baby acne and the cradle cap and Cameron is no exception.  I finally just realized what that mess was in his eyebrows.  Who knew babies could get cradle cap in their eyebrows? 

Cameron is such a great sleeper.  I can move him from the bed to his infant carrier seat and he will fall back asleep.  He is still sleeping quite a lot during the day.  He finally has about 3-4 hours where he will be awake at SOME point during the day.  Lately, that time has been at night which is ok with me.  Ben can bond with him at night.  Cameron sleeps on his side with a sleep positioner to keep him from rolling over.  However, if I am working at my computer, I put the play pen in front of my desk and let him sleep on his tummy there.  

Cam really seems to enjoy his baths.  Even if you are fussy, you calm down for bathtime.  I can't wait for the day to see my two boys in the tub together.  

Cameron was lucky enough to get to have his Grandma and Granny come by this month and help care for him.  We are so blessed to have family help welcome you to this world little man.  

Big brother Mason told you a story about Goldilocks and the 3 bears the other day.  That was his first real conversation with him.  Mason wants to hold Cameron at least once a day and is always very concerned when the baby is crying.  I think he is going to make an excellent big brother - but he may have a hard time letting the baby play with his OWN baby toys.  

<img src=""http://www.simply-solved.com/albums/cam-1month/IMG_1652.jpg"" align=""Right"">At week five he is now really starting to pay attention to those flying things around his head when he is in the swing.  It is nice to see him progressing in the world. He must be concentrating really hard on seeing things because his eyes are crossing like mad anytime I try to catch him looking at the camera. 







  I think we are finally catching our first smiles this week which just warms your heart."

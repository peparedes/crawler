"event","this weekend was pretty amazing Kayla is now 19! Woot! we celebrated with Olive Garden Comedy City and then hanging out at my house afterwards me and kayla had fun and who knows about ryan and amanda couples shouldnt go to birthday parties together BOO! oh well right after comedy city i got into the car and took off my cute but very painful shoes and jacket which meant i jsut had on my cute brown dress (that is fairly backless and just has strings that tie in the back) but i forget that i needed to get fruit punch so i went into a gas station after comedy city to pick it up and i ran in with just my dress and throwing my shoes on without fastening them expecting to run in and out really quick (BAD IDEA!!!) the cashier was on the phone so there was already two guys in line one older (60's at least i would guess and not to be mean but was semi scrubby old guy creapy kinda look) and then one probably around 40ish or younger  so i grab my stuff and then stood in line feeling a little self conscious about what i was wearing and then the older guy made some comment about me looking hot and skanky (I dont remember the exactly what he said i just remember feeling DISGUSTING!!!!) and the other guy just kinda a laughed so i just looked up like ha ha your SO funny but didnt really say anything THEN he says right before checking out his stuff that hes sorry and that he when he sees a pretty girl that he cant help himself and his brain gets all crazy or something which would have been fine IF he didnt scan his eyes up and down me when he said it EWWW GROSS then proceeded to walk all the way around me to leave the gas station every time i go somewhere for kaylas birthday i get hit on by old guys and it needs to stop

then kayla and i went and worked at the races on saturday where we got rained out and was out of there before 930 and i made $20 in tips which is AMAZING kayla claimed that the guys were checking me out during the night and thats why i got the tips i love feeling pretty it doesnt happen often so when i does i reveal in it... 


PS i would just like to note that checking me out is ok if your not old enough to be my dad and the fact that i was a lot more covered when working in case some people did understand why one guy checking me out was bad and the other one wasnt"

"event","So turns out its a bad idea to tell your best friend you like them... Who knew??? 

not me i guess (also dont tell them when you have a few in you cause then you get told you told him this by one of your mutual friends) and turns out i might have just lost my best friend... i wish he could just get over it and just start talking to me again oh well... i guess i cant make him do anything taht he doesnt want to do my the summer will settle us down and we can hang out next year again *sigh* boys are dumb  (so are girls though i will admit it) 

so avoiding studying for my astronomy quiz why am i really going to know how many moons jupiter has come on now. But i lost all motivation to study... i blame sundrop soda gives me adhd ever since giving it up for a month..  this week seems to going so slow ugh! i want to go back home were i dont have a confusing best friend no offense to maribeth or kayla but i have no desire to date either of them so our relationship rarely gets annoying or confusing... lol

cant we all go back to kindergarten when all you fought about was who got what crayon????"

"event","*sigh* OK So Easter was amazing i got to see Trevor and Katie two weekends in a row... came home friday night went to church and ended up gettting the giggles in the middle of the sermon which is naturally a bad thing but those unfamilar with a Good Friday service it is very serious and somber and there is Amy giggling away i couldnt help it and i did try to stop but the more i tried to stop the more i tried to giggle and to make matters worse i was directly in front of the pastor (granted a few pews back but right in front of her) yeah needless to say mom was not happy lol oh well.... Saturday i woke up to the written instructions that i was supposed to make my Apple bar dessert for Easter dinner (which i wouldnt even be able to make it too) so i did and by the time it was in the actual baking phase i had to leave for work (i worked 12-11) (at the racetracks in shawano at a foodstand) where i got to eat once at 3 and did not have a break for a good 8 hours and it was interesting to say the least my legs were cramping up for the rest of the night when i was sleeping woke up on easter not feeling well but ate some breakfast and then head to church and then to my aunt and uncles for dinner and cards before coming back for point 

saddest part of the weekend Maribeth was home and i couldnt go see her which is ok cause i mean easter is technically for family but i still wanted to see her.... sad 


Anyways (i apparently wrote that earlier and closed out idk so this is what i really came to write) this week was bad well at least not good... i decided to delete alex from my phone and msn(but didnt block him) so if he wants to hang out he better make the effort cause im  not gonna this decision is the reason my life has been BlAh this week and hanging out with him on thursday (aka the final straw) was horrible HOWEVER this weekend was AMAZING! friday me and kayla hung out we went to gb (malling) and got cold stone and then went to Comedy City small show But HUGE LAUGHS!!! oh it was so good it was just what i needed...and its kayla's b-day next weekend which tentative plans of olive garden and Comedy City again but this time we get to dress up and have a bunch of other people YEA!! :D and then maybe go back to my place to hang out fun fun im excited also Saturday races got rained out so i got to go home from work early amazing and now im back at point and have to get going to go hang out with some people i havent seen all weekend so ill write more later"

"event","So summer is going to be interesting this summer or at least busy... I got accepted and will be a cook/kitchen person at a camp about five minutes from my house with this job i will be living at the camp during the weeke Sunday afternoon till friday afternoon and i also will be working at the race track on Saturday nights from like 4-10 so basically Amy is not going to have a life this summer because i have a feeling either Saturday mornings or Friday nights will be reserved for sleeping and that leaves very limited time for hanging out with friends

onto other news Amy was drinking the other night for my brothers 21st one of my really good friends 21st and my best friends 19th birthday party... BAD IDEA! by the end of the night (well not even end of the night more like the beginning-midway through) the night i was sick and hystarical which for anyone who doesnt know me and think that im a dumb drunken girl... this has only happened this one time and the first time that i got upset was justified im still not to happy about it... but ends up i ended up pouring my heart out to my best friend which is fine but apparently i told him i what i thought about him.. (which is obviously not anything mean b/c he is my best friend but could definetly be OVERLY complimentary for a best friend(if you catch my drift))  so that could be interesting to say the least....

Then last night i was trying to talk a very depressed guy down... i was a little nervous about what he was going to do last night but he seems safe and everyone around him is uninjured today... but he hasnt come online today, and my roommate did say she saw him running today so he at least came out of his room but i still think hes reallly depressed... *sigh* i think i might go check on him"

I need to build endurance i did a mile run jog yesterday and i had to stop twice granted i never been much of a runner ok so i never let the word enter my vocabulary in general but trevor and katie are starting to do running and enter run walks together (like the pointbewery one) and maybe i can have an excuse to go visit them one weekend if i do a run/walk with them fun fun granted with my job (if i get it) at camp would limit me to going down on friday and then doing the run and then coming back after it on saturday .... but thats alright i would still have time to hang out with them...  so hopefully another run today and see if i have an ultimate team for this block...oh and classes today... cant forget about them.."

Saturday-woke up at 730 drove home (to navarino) showered and got ready picked up maribeth dropped off Emily in Green Bay and then went to Jared's house were i finally played settlers of Catan?? or something like taht good game went to mall with MB dropper her off at Comedy City went to Perkins, Friends arrived late and ate slow GRRRR! i hate being late, but i was to One Act Scrap heap (?) im horrible with names today.... it was AMAZING i would recommend people to go see it but since it was the last show it would be a little hard. OH speaking out which if Jared is reading this my friends LOVED it as well and 3 out of 4 girls agree with me and maribeth about the spikey hair lol :D and the other one i havent seen so really it could be 4 out 4 by far one of the best days of spring break then drove MB back and went home to bed

Sunday- sat around and did nothing and it was wonderful, watched walk the line and laid about with the parents watching tv and just veggin

Monday- Dad had off from work so we did yard work for the start of the day and then cleaned the house another night of nothing much less need then the first so the start of getting antsy and bored was about to hit

Tuesday- went to quilting with my grandma showed up during there break by mere concidence got to here about the good ol' days... they asked me if i knew waht an out house was lol and for the record i did. then called up alex hung with him for the rest of the day went crusin the bonduel cecil and gillet for lack of anything better to do then mike joined us after school let out for them but the really cool thing i want is these awesome little kid costumes spiderman and batman i wanted to buy them and do superhero wars it would have been so much fun but they were 20 bucks each and i dont have 40 dollars to spend even thou i think it could provide HOURS of entertainment

Wednesday- called Cara up and hit the mall tried on some prom dresses SORRY MARIBETH I NEED TO DO THIS WITH YOU YET but no one was in debs so i took advantage of the opportunity walked around for a bit came back home about 5ish went to church later taht night

Thursday- hung around the house cleaned, studied, putzed online for awhile, tacos at hurricane dawns at night and hung out with ryan (rye bread) micheal s. and katie from gillet  me and katie both talked about our love for the songs had a bad day and your beautiful when they came on the radio

Friday- went to appleton with mom so i could pick up michaela(kayla) at school mom went to work but dropped us off at the mall we got two miles in and did a stop at the food court and got my lovely gloria jeans drink (i think that makes 3 for the week but i have to indulge when i come home because i cant get them in college)  then we went back to my house to switch cars and get a bunch of games for game night over at kaylas much fun much much fun.

Saturday-with kayla in gb for a few hours more gloria jeans im seriously addicated hung out at kaylas house for the day until movie that night Larry the Cable guy. *sigh* kayla didnt laugh at all and it wasnt as great as i thought it was going to be but eh tahts alright

BUT UGH DRUNK GIRLS!!!!!! they just need to know when to go home and stop trying to bring a boy with them. Ok that makes it sound like i wanted to go home with a boy, but not at all more like i knew this boy SHOULD go home by himself to save him a headache in the morning, but i dont think he really had an option that wouldnt end in a headache after last night. Just thankful he stayed in his bedroom last night and hopefully didnt share it with anyone else. My guy friends need to get a clue sometimes love them to death but really should be having this many girl problems so consistently in a row..... (ok so this journal will only make sense to me and maribeth probably) but i just need to vent before talking to alex about it so i dont get to pisted STUPID BOYS & GIRLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","So last night i got woke up at 5 AM there is very few things that wouldnt make me mad getting woken up for at 5. And this was definetly not one of them. The emergency alarm was going on at my dorm and the entire dorm had to evacuate the building. Now its pretty cold in Stevens Point with my jacket and everything else i put on to go outside. So leaving my dorm in my pjs and boots (thankfully maribeth yelled that i would need shoes when i stepped into the hallway) was not fun at all. Thank goodness the hec was open or i would have been really mad. I still dont even know what happened. Luckily i got back to bed right away considering i only was sleeping for a few hours i kinda knew i would. But still no fun no fun at all. This weekend was so weird in general though we were expecting all these people from all over to come to point this weekend and none of them did and THEN no one knew about maribeth coming to point and she showed up on saturday to the surprise of many im sure. All in all good weekend graffitti party was fun got a shirt i may never wear again but thats ok i knew what i was getting into when i went, and jesses is always a good time (and when i say always i mean usually) :D. Well i should go eat and then study somemore before sociallizing and v-ball tongith. Goodnight to all and hopefully you will not get woken up at 5 in the morning cuz its not fun."

First camp people should not be at the same party together especailly if one of them is drunk. However Crazy Mike did teach us all this awesome song that he sings to his campers. THe trick to the song is that its not about a skunk its about birth control (well about pulling out to be exact) Now it probably wont be the same effect as Mike telling it but hopefully it will still be good. Enjoy!

I stuck my head in a little skunk's hole, 
And the little skunk said, 
Well, Bless my soul! 
Take it out (take it out) 
Take it out (Take it out) 
Remoooooooove it! 

I didn't take it out 
And the little skunk said, 
If you don't take it out, 
you will wish you were dead! 
Take it out (take it out)

Remoooooove it.

"event","Last night i returned to my room fairly early. So needless to say i was asleep by the time my roommate came home. So at about 1 oclock last night i wake up to someone poking at me. And i wake up to Ben Weyers(one of the guys from my graduating class) My roommate apparently met him at a party found out he graduated with me and brought him back to our room(here i will note that my roommate was extremely drunk). Soon i fell back to sleep only to be woken up once again by Ben. Amy your roommate went to the bathroom awhile ago and i think you should go check on her. Ben *sigh* give her two more minutes and if shes not back wake me up again. *POKE POKE POKE* Amy the CAs are here i think you should wake up emily is passed out in the bathroom. Im going to leave but i think you should go help her. I (after taking awhile to find my shoes) walk to the bathroom to find to CAs my CA amanda and another CA who i dont know he leaves right away meanwhile me and amanda try to wake up Emily (my roommate) who is passed out on the toliet.  She was not waking up and Amanda really wanted to move her before someone comes into the bathroom. So Amanda and me try to pull emily up this is when she actually wakes up a little and manages to pull up her pants and underwear.  So I walked emily back to our room and got her all set up for her night, tucked her in, gave her a garbage can, and some water. Later that night someone unlocks our door (reminder me and my roommate are still in our room) and in walks in a drunk halie (emilys friend) and some boy i never met before(he seemed sober). He explains that halie stole emilys keys couldnt find hers and she needed some place to crash. So in came the third drunk(I forgot to metion Emilys best friend from back home came up but she passed out in emilys bed right away). It was actually a fairly hilarious evening all in all. Especially if we dont get in trouble for it. ok well emily will no matter what as long as i dont(which i shouldnt because i hid my beer before i left to get emily). Well thats all for now i need to go to bed. G'night"

This<br>demon will make you confused about what you<br>want to do next. You can be quiet often and a<br>little on the dark side, but not depressed. You<br>can sometimes make poor decisions because the<br>Demon won't let you find which one is right,<br>but you remain calm which is good in many<br>situations. This is probably the hardest Demon<br>to get rid of. Hopefully you will grow out of<br>it or you can try accepting more things they<br>way they are.

Well isn't that the truth, I think confusion is my normal emotional state actually when I not feeling confused I'm even more confused about why im not confused. Confusing? Isn't it."

So... Maribeth has been telling me to get a LJ for a long time. So here it is i figure i already go see maribeth's journal all the time i may as well write my own stuff too. Trevor and Katie came up last weekend which was the most exciting thing since coming to college. I love Trevor and Katie they are a blast even if trevor did fall and start a domino effect causing me to hurt my back when i landed on Jesse's table. It was actually quite hilarious until i laid in my bed that night with an aching pain that i couldnt explain.  Also a quick note, In sports this week the Fightin' Hobos (the ultimate frisbee team Im on) fought on to victory over Centrifuge. It was an amazing victory 8-1. The conditions were awesome not necessarily great for playing but still excellent. There was a fairly thick fog so it semi resembled a battlefield where figures were suddenly coming through the fog. It was awesome well Maribeth im not addicted yet but give me a day."

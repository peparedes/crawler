Honestly, she lived a lot longer past him than I thought she would, but it&#39;s still really sad. She was 13, pretty old for a cat, but that means I have had and raised her almost half my life. Three generations of cats.. Pywacket - Loki and Tasuki - and Chibi. Now they&#39;re all gone and I&#39;m really going to miss them. Having to work all day without crying is one of the hardest things I&#39;ve had to do in a long time. I&#39;m probably going to be bawling as soon as I get off. I should have known I wouldn&#39;t be allowed to have a good birthday for once. I never do. I can only console myself that she&#39;s no longer suffering and that she lived a long and full life. Goodbye Tasuki, I will always love and miss you &lt;3</span>"

"event","I think I need to just accept that my birthday is cursed and learn to stop caring. I have had one good birthday that I can remember and the rest have ranged between mediocre and downright bad. My birthday always fails. Not even a paid trip to Vegas can save the curse that is my birthday. Birthday curse wins. The years before that when I tried to plan something for myself, it always ended up bleh. This year isn't going to be that promising either. Why? I'm spending it at a wedding where the bride doesn't even like me. Whoo hoo! So much fun.&nbsp;

And yet I have friends that are trying to salvage this for me. The topic comes up and what happens? I start crying at work. Why? Because I have no actual faith that it can be salvaged. The same thing will happen that always happens. I'll invite a bunch of friends and the majority of them won't come for one reason or another, so I'll be sad and disappointed. Though I guess sad and disappointed is better than sick or injured like my usual Halloweens. But still. By and large, my birthdays suck.&nbsp;

So whatever. I give up. I'm not even going to bother expecting my friends to make time for me and set myself for disappointment like every other year. It's not exciting anymore. It's depressing. A miserable birthday spent at an awkward wedding is just par for the course now.&nbsp;"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Sometimes it's better not to pay to see a movie in the theaters""><span style=""font-size: smaller; "">So, I watched a chick flick. I downloaded it, because really no one else wanted to see it and I was only mildly interested in the potential for a character that seemed to share my beliefs, so I was curious. I liked the fact that the girl was non-monogamist&nbsp;and open. If humans were meant to mate for life, it'd be a genetic imperative. Since there do exist species that mate for life, and since humans are not one of them, I don't see the need to conform to the social standard that says we should be in 1-1 relationships only. I liked that this character seemed to share that view. And the &quot;why can't we just have sex?&quot; 'cause really.. sex isn't that big of a deal and I don't see why any activity, even something as intimate as sex, has to be reserved for a single person. There isn't any other activity where we say &quot;We do this together, so now we can't do it with anyone else&quot;. Imagine how restricted social interaction would become!&nbsp;<br /><br />But I digress. I was interested in seeing a character I may relate to. I knew they'd ruin her. It's a sappy Hollywood chick flick so of course they'd make her fall in love and want to be with him despite what she said. And you know, that's fine... it's not like you can't love someone and still be non-monogamous. I'm pretty irritated at how they went about it. Despite her claims and beliefs, she's the one that starts to fall hard first. She's the one who can't reconcile how she feels with her belief in non-monogamy. The movie basically had her &quot;learning the errors of her ways&quot; and learning what all the fuss was about once you find someone that you really love.&nbsp;<br /><br />It pisses me off.&nbsp;<br /><br />You can love someone without it having to be exclusive. You can love multiple someones, even. What's worse, is that it wasn't even that she changed her mind. She was made out to just be someone grasping as the convenient excuse because she was afraid of commitment, or because she had simply never found someone she loved enough. It pisses me off. Don't try to address a different ethical and emotional standard to the norm only to label it like &quot;sorry, you just don't know any better.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />a;skldefgaosd!! &nbsp; /end rant</span><br type=""_moz"" /></lj-cut>"

We had him checked, just in case there was a treatment, but it turned out he was as bad or worse than we thought. The most immediate problem is something I forgot the term for, but basically when he started losing weight (he was down to 10 lbs from his original 23 lbs) the toxins that were stored in the fat got into his body. He had trouble eating or drinking and so was dehydrated and nauseous. We could have basically put a feeding tube into his stomach and force-fed him for a few weeks/months until that cleared up enough to figure out what the primary problem was, which was some kind of intestinal cancer. The odds weren't good, and even at best there was a low chance of chemo. Plus there seemed to be liver failure as well. So basically... we could have prolonged his suffering just enough to find out what else was killing him. We didn't want him to suffer anymore, or to be unhappy at the end, so we put him down.&nbsp;<br />Saddest fucking thing ever.&nbsp;<br />We held him as the euthanasia relaxed him and he just sorta went to sleep, and we were all sobbing. He was 13, I've had him half my life since the day he was born in my closet. He was such an awesome cat. And the worst thing is that we just kept petting him and he seemed like he was sleeping, and I petted down to his tail and it just about killed me to see just no life at all as I let go. I don't even know how I got us all home safely. Reflex and autopilot.&nbsp;<br />I still keep crying. I miss my cat!</lj-cut></span>"

I think it's just all the stress of everything that happened yesterday combined. On the plus side, I didn't feel nauseous or lose my appetite, so that's definite progress since summer. On the down side, the fact that I still feel like this just goes to show that I'm not entirely recovered. Another plus and minus to it; it's a weaker reaction than I was experiencing before,&nbsp;but it has now lasted into the next day. It's annoying feeling bothered like this. I can't tell if I'm a little high-strung or just a little sad. I don't even know why I should be either. I just want to curl in a ball and ignore everything, but of course my mind can't stop so I need to stay occupied. But I'm bothered and nervy and can't focus.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Murphy's Law mocks my attempts at fun""><span style=""font-size: smaller; "">Seems like things can never go too well without Murphy's Law rearing its ugly head and making a mess of things. It started off well. I had a long day of driving on thursday because first I drove down to Long Beach to get my hair cut (like Rapunzel!).&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to my brothers'... which, ok, that kind of backfired because I needed to get stuff for Luke's class and it turned out the campus didn't even sell it so it was a waste of time, but at least I saw Pat and Elyse and talked to Luke a bit on Skype. Then I went to JoAnn's to get some stuff for a V-day project, but they didn't have a lot of what I needed. Ok.. maybe it didn't start off as well as I thought, but at least it wasn't terrible. I got some of what I needed and went to visit Dawn. This is good times. I was running late, so there was a lot of traffic on the way back to LA and we didn't get to Danny's until about 7pm. But that was still ok, because at least it was dark. Dawn made delicious meatball dinner and then we settled in to play Amnesia.&nbsp;<br /><br />For the record, this game is hilarious. Especially if you watch this video here&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loSzpvq73FY""><span style=""font-size: smaller; "">www.youtube.com/watch</span></a><span style=""font-size: smaller; "">&nbsp;I swear, I laugh so hard it hurts.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, we turned off all the lights, turned up the sound, and watched Danny play. Unfortunately it took a good long while to start seeing anything creepy (we were already a third of the way through before it started getting more fun). The theory of staring at the cenobyte reject making it less scary was also proven false. It was still freaky. But cuddles and giggles and things didn't help with the atmosphere and we didn't find anything scary. Well whatever, we eventually curled up in a pile (three people in a single twin sized bed = cozy). Friday was full of more Amnesia! And we finally saw the cenobyte reject more! &quot;Hey Danny, did you check every door?&quot; .. good job Dawn, that last door had the monster and RUN LIKE HELL! Were we freaking out? No, we were laughing hysterically. This game makes me lol. Surprises me maybe, but doesn't scare. It's really entertaining.&nbsp;<br /><br />Eventually we went down to OC because I had to take Dawn home, and we all decided to go dancing at In Cahoots, too. Line dancing is fun! Traffic was a nightmare though, as usual for late afternoon, but we still go in before they started charging. Didn't dance as much since there was a lot more couple dances than usual, but danced a bit and had fun. Went to Denny's after and talked for a good long while. Left a little after midnight.&nbsp;<br /><br />And that's where Murphy decided to start mocking us. Lanes were closed riiight as we got on the freeway and some dumb timid bitch was stopped and we ended up hitting her. No one was hurt, but much much suckage anyway. Car accidents suck. Dawn's car ended up pretty badly damaged and undrivable. Airbag powder and radiator steam was an unpleasant smell. I don't really think it was Dawn's fault because the bitch shouldn't have been stopped ON the freeway! But well, we'll see how it goes. Hopefully well. By the time we got back to Dawn's it was around 1am or later and we headed back to LA. Of course, I'm retared, went the wrong way on the 57. Hit the 91. Detour anyone? Yeah. Late night, open road, not a lot of cars. I wasn't paying attention to my speed. I got up around 85. Noticed and stopped accelerating. Then noticed a car really close behind me. Then noticed it had lights on top. Then the lights lit up. Oh shit. Amazingly he let me off with a warning. <br />&quot;Do you know what the speed limit is?&quot;<br />&quot;65?&quot;<br />&quot;Then why were you going faster than that?&quot;<br />&quot;*sigh* I'm sorry, lots of open road and not a lot of cars and I lost track of my speed. I slowed when I noticed&quot;&nbsp;<br />&quot;*runs info and comes back* Keep your speed down.&quot;<br />&quot;Yessir.&quot;<br />Got back to LA around 2am and I passed out at Danny's because I was tired and didn't want to be in a car anymore at that point.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course that was just the start of the day. Still had to come home once I woke up, where my car stalled while I was trying to park it. I forgot to run errands and so dragged my ass back out for that after a small nap and shower. Car didn't want to start. Fabulous. Got it going and left. First stop, and car didn't want to start again. Coaxed and pleaded with my car to start and when it did I headed straight for Autozone to get spark plugs. Got those put in, and hoping to gawd that it solves the problem. Oh right, and stereo is being&nbsp;spastic&nbsp;so there's probably a short somewhere or something, too. Not going to deal with it right now unless it impedes on the running of the car. But still. Fucking Murphy's Law!&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: smaller; ""><br />At least the day's almost over. Unless fate decides to kick my ass some more for Akane's birthday party tomorrow, I can go to sleep in a few hours and sleep this day off like a bad hangover.&nbsp;<br />And on a rather random side note, I know people have the best intentions but I'm getting a little annoyed with people trying to fatten me up with fattening foods. Granted, I'm not worrying much about how fatty things are because I am trying to gain a little weight, but that doesn't mean I want to gorge on junk purely for the sake of getting some weight back. I want HEALTHY weight. If it takes me another year to get those 5-10 pounds back, so be it, as long as I'm not losing any more and it's a healthy gain. I've gained about a half a pound in the last 2-3 months since I've been able to eat again. I'm fine with slow and steady progress. I'm happy enough to be able to eat again, I'm not going to piss my body off by stuffing it with too much junk.&nbsp;<br /><br />I hope the rest of the month isn't like this... but at least it was equal parts pain and pleasure, so it wasn't all bad. I just about have a schedule for visiting Danny, at this point. I have plans to visit Dawn at least once a month if I can help it. We may try to go down there more often now because we found out the Line Dancing instructor does private lessons and can be done as a group, so Nora is planning on hiring her regularly on weekends. This will be fun, when I can manage to go down there.&nbsp;</span><br /></lj-cut>"

Now, I don't believe in Astrology, but I can find it entertaining. I find this especially entertaining because I was supposedly always a Virgo and I adamantly didn't agree with this. Many people agreed that it didn't really fit and thought I should be a Leo. I blamed it on being born late. But lo! I am now apparently a Leo after all. So, for kicks, I'm going to post the info about both Zodiac signs and compare what attributes I actually have in common with them. Underlining the things I actually feel fit me.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></span><lj-cut text=""Long ass info about Virgo and Leo""><span style=""font-size: smaller; "">VIRGO:&nbsp;<br />Traits<br />You are thought of as quite shy and introvert, and even quite naive. Your personality and composure is virginal in the sense that you are passive and still don&rsquo;t let your personality and approach get affected by others. The positives are that <u>you are very organized, meticulous and systematic </u>and don&rsquo;t like cluttering and irregularity.<br />You perform your tasks with a machine like planning and accuracy and this might get on others&rsquo; nerves. You are very down to earth and <u>are acknowledged for your ability of making people feel comfortable and at home in your company</u>. This is in close association with the fact that you possess an ant-like sincerity and solemnity, and at the same time don&rsquo;t bother about who gets the credit or the spotlight.<br />You might also possess that nervousness and apprehension that is quite characteristic to people who work hard and want their results too bad. You are <u>not that reserved against sex</u> but take it in a very pure sense. You fancy yourself for being too wise in terms of managing money and making friends, that is the reason why you tend to be a little stingy and at the same time, <u>a bit too analytical and judgmental of the people around you, even your close friends and family.</u><br />Qualities that make you lucky are systematic, <u>rational, communicative,</u> and discriminating. Qualities that hinder your success are unbending, indifference and <u>argumentative.</u></span><span style=""font-size: smaller; "">Personality<br />Of all the twelve signs, you will find these Virgo guys the busiest. And here&rsquo;s the funny part &ndash; it&rsquo;s not that they take up the most responsibility or the toughest job, or that they are so polite that they do all their coworkers&rsquo; work. It&rsquo;s just that they end up the most swamped &ndash; might be because they are not that well-organized, or for some other reason, but they just can&rsquo;t seem to be getting enough time.<br />Another very important characteristic, probably their most prominent, is their desire to serve people. They can literally become slaves for the ones they love; pleasing them is all they wish to do! In doing so, they can get tricked or let down once in a while, but they do make very good friends.<br />Virgoans are very versatile and have a great number of talents, but most remarkable of them is their <u>excellent judging and critical capability. </u><u>They can size up things, form an opinion, and express it in a very diplomatic and constructive way</u>. This is what makes them such good critiques, teachers and diplomats. But they do this with a very honest humility, and just the way they are critical about everything, so also <u>they are critical and judgmental about their own ability and talent. </u>And this is horrible for their future prospects. Their friends should be there to support and encourage them at such moments; after all, that&rsquo;s what friends are for, aren&rsquo;t they?<br />And this attitude is not that great for their relationships either. This tendency continues into the married life even with all the devotion and love and care. They start getting judgmental about the partner&rsquo;s habits and attitude, and at some point, either the partner gets irritated because of the constant nagging and pointing out, or the Virgo gets irritated with the partner&rsquo;s habits which is, of course, magnified by his/her critical way of thinking. [haha... Ken &gt;.&gt;]<br />This brings out another trait in the Virgos &ndash; they seem to worry a lot. So they surely are tender and talented, but they need to mend a thing or two if they wish to make the best of their life and love.<br />Friendship<br /><u>Virgo value friendship greatly and are ready to put great amounts of effort</u> &ndash; not just to keep their friends happy, but also to be of use to him/her in every possible way. That means Virgo will leave no stone unturned in providing their friends with every single comfort they can ask for, and do every single chore for them, just so they wouldn&rsquo;t have to stress themselves.<br />That&rsquo;s so very sweet of you Virgo, but there is a problem with this. It&rsquo;s not about being used; you are not so stupid as to be taken for a ride. The thing is that when you are busy making life better for your friend, you miss out on him &ndash; the person. People say friendship is all about being there for the other person when he needs you most, but if you have spent absolutely no time with the other person, there is no concept of friend, and with friend there is no friendship. So no doubt you are appreciated by your friends &ndash; who does not like to be taken care of?<br />So the message is simple &ndash; don&rsquo;t think that when it comes to your problems, you can take care of them on your own; involve others in your life just as you involve yourselves in others. Once that is figured out, you have this other trait of making comments. I know you have an excellent sense of humor and most of your comments are absolutely spot on, but to tell you the truth, these critiques don&rsquo;t have a lot many friends. So try to make your comments more humorous than critical, constructive, and as few as possible.<br />Other than this, you <u>have the ability to keep your friendship going for long</u>, which is great. Also, it is very important for you to have a lot of really intriguing hobbies, and you are really passionate about them. So you make it easier for your friend to embrace on of them and make headway in it.<br />Love and Sex<br />You have the <u>gift of charming those of the other sex,</u> but you are too modest to think that anyone could take you seriously. That&rsquo;s why Virgo duck low whenever they have the chance of approaching someone and moving things forward. What you need is a little self-confidence; have some guts, stop waiting around and grab the opportunities that come your way. But don&rsquo;t overdo it, because what makes you the magnetic the most is that very modesty of yours. So in the words of the Buddha, take the middle path.&nbsp;<br />But this is not as easy as one might perceive; Virgo have a natural repulsion for emotional or sexual involvement of any kind. You just can&rsquo;t stop to thinking that the other person might find you unattractive or insufficient. This is not self-loathing; this is something even worse &ndash; this is called lack of self-esteem. What you need at this point is some serious soul-searching &ndash; try looking at your self from an objective point of view, try talking to a friend who&rsquo;s close to you, or take the help of a professional counselor. I don&rsquo;t wish to scare you; this might not happen to all of you. But if it is happening, you need to give it some serious attention &ndash; people suffer from this for entire lives without actually managing to cope up with it. [this paragraph is so unlike me it's sad..]<br />Try your best to fight with your inner demons, and one day you will have that loving relationship you always wanted. And when you do, don&rsquo;t let it go, no matter what. Experiment with new things and try out new ways of making your life spicy; trust me, your partner will love it.<br />Career<br />The first thing one would notice in Virgos, career-wise, is their great love for outdoor activities. [hahaha.. ahah.. haaa...] There might be the odd ones working in closed, congested cubicles and slogging days and nights to make it to the top of the ladder. But most of them would give anything to have a career in a field such as farming, fishing or surveying. They also like to nurture things and see them growing &ndash; that can explain their great affinity for agriculture.<br />Also as I have pointed out on amply, they have a tremendous urge to serve others and take care of them. That is why I would say the best profession for them could only be in the field of medicine, or teaching, or the like. Probably nothing can satisfy you more than helping a patient recover from an illness and reducing his pain. Teaching, again, involves taking care of raw talents, nurturing them and seeing them grow into matured, capable individuals.<br />Other than this, you have an immense need to communicate. So the career of a critique or a journalist can also be very rewarding. The way you look at things, and the unique way in which you are able to present them will be your main plus points. Virgos also have a variety of natural talents which they bring literally from their mother&rsquo;s womb. So if you have a strong enough impulse, I would even recommend a career in art for you.<br />There are however a few weak points &ndash; Virgos are not born leaders. So early on in their career, no matter how strong you might be in it, if you are given a huge responsibility, you might fumble and spoil the task, and lose what little confidence you have. You are just not comfortable with stations of power, or the spotlight. So you should not take up positions just for the money and status that come with them &ndash; there might be other more enticing opportunities for you.<br /><br />LEO:<br />Traits<br />Lion is considered the ruler of the jungle, so also you are <u>the leader of your own world; you exhibit impeccable bravery, superiority</u> and sovereignty. You are expected to achieve extraordinary feats. You have the strength of character to take command of any situation and your presence commands respect and attention. And just like a king, <u>you have a big heart, you are generous and sensitive to others&rsquo; feelings.</u><br />But again, you are <u>quite egotistical</u> and it&rsquo;s quite easy to flatter and take advantage of you. At the same time, <u>you tend to be quite self-congratulatory and boastful and at the same time dominating, courting resentment from your peers.</u> Leo is all about ambition and compassion; and at the same time headstrong and a little corrupted by power. But it equally characteristic of you to be contemplative and moody, especially when you are with yourself.<br /><u>You can get into deep depressions, but the only answer to this problem is self-control</u>, hard work and paying heed to others&rsquo; counsel. You show your ambitious and sensitive character with your relationships with the opposite sex. And you are also in quite a bit of luck, but being a little imprudent, it would be ill-advised for you to try your hand at speculation.<br />Qualities that make you lucky are <u>bighearted, forceful,</u> aristocratic, and <u>affectionate.</u> Qualities that hinder your success are <u>aggressiveness, boastful,</u> haughty, and <u>pride.<br /></u>Personality<br />All Leos of the world can be described using one metaphor &ndash; the sun. They want to be a sun giving out light and warmth to the whole world, and to see everyone in their circles thriving in or at least benefitting from their radiance. One other important thing needs to understand is that Leo is the sign of extremities.<br />People of this Leo sun sign innately want to lead and be a master, but for those they adore and revere, they are ready to become slaves. They are <u>very well organized and do things just the way they ought to be done, but it is also true that they are much better at organizing and systematizing others&rsquo; lives than their own. </u>This trait of theirs <u>sometimes borders on bossiness.</u> But all this effort to improve another person&rsquo;s life comes with an unnatural amount of warmth, kindly encouragement and a promise for help without having to ask, whenever it is needed.<br />The other thing about Leos is their <u>creative streak</u> &ndash; they possess some talent that hardly anyone around them is good at. But they can also be influenced very easily, and are prone to losing out against nagging criticism. They therefore have a great <u>need to be encouraged and shown the right way.</u> In friendships, Leos are <u>very generous and caring, </u>but may also get a little carried away and shower their affections on the wrong person. The same happens in case of love interests, but if the other person is the right one, he/she will find <u>no derth of kindness and generosity.</u><br />Leos are <u>very passionate and very faithful partners,</u> but the problem is their extremely sensitive nature. And this sensitivity is on most occasions <u>eclipsed by their influential and bossy exteriors.</u> So it&rsquo;s quite possible that their partner may have hurt them in something he/she says without his/her even realizing it. That&rsquo;s why living with a Leo takes some getting used to.<br />Friendship</span><span style=""font-size: smaller; ""><br type=""_moz"" />Leos have a very <u>wide circle of acquaintances and friends and mutual friends</u>. But most of them are just part of their circle of influence, they will deal with them only if a need arises on either side, and e<u>ven though they are helpful and dependable and all that, they do not take these as their &lsquo;friends&rsquo;. That takes a lot of time &ndash; they form a rapport first, find out the likes and dislikes and more importantly the character of the other person, and only then decide if the other person is right for them.</u> And once they have given him/her that status, <u>the friendship is for a lifetime. They will stop at very little in making sure that friend of theirs is not in any kind of distress.</u><br /><u>Even if they have lost touch with their friend for a long time, they do not find it difficult to resume from where they left it. This is because friendship means too much to them. They would themselves not want someone to call them a friend just after a brief acquaintance.</u> They of course like meeting new people, making contacts, enjoying their company and being of use to them whenever need by. But <u>the title of &lsquo;friend&rsquo; is too sanctimonious for them to be conferred to too many people.</u><br /><u>Once they make a friend, they wanna do a lot for them.</u> For example, if the friend has some talent that he/she wants to show or some project that he/she wants to work on, there can be no one better than the Leo at encouraging and helping out the other person in his/her endeavors. When they become adults, Leos show their generosity by giving away generous presents to their friends children, and taking them to fancy restaurants for dinner. Now, such things may turn on their head and the friends may start thinking that our guy is splashing money at them. Thus, there is always a fine line that should never be crossed. Too bad for the Leo because there is no joy for him/her greater than that of knowing that others derive pleasure from things that he/she gifted them with his/her hard earned money. That is the way of the world, the misers can&rsquo;t keep everything in and the generous can&rsquo;t give everything out.<br />Love and Sex<br />When a Leo falls in love, he/she falls very hard and very quick. He/she will shout out and declare to the world that he loves such and such a person. Leos are <u>full of zest and vitality when it comes to love, sex and relationships, and for this reason they give a lot and expect a lot in return.</u> Sure they are let down at times, sure there are some heartaches and sad moments, but that&rsquo;s a part of the Leo way of life. And you what &ndash; many years later, at old age, when they look back upon their lives,<u> they experience happiness, nostalgia, sadness too, but never regret.</u> So as the sun shines out through the clouds, the Leo keeps enjoying life without losing his/her vitality even with all the setback he/she suffers in life.<br />The Leo&rsquo;s <u>enthusiasm and verve</u> makes the partner enjoy all the things that the Leo enjoys. It happens almost naturally, and takes hardly any persuation. One thing the Leo and his/her partner need to realize is that even in the most intimate of relationships, sharing interests and combined enjoyment are required as a lubricant is required for smooth running of a machine. And this need is experienced all the more by the Leo.<br />Leos <u>express their creativity and passion in their sexual life quite skillfully and also set up the atmosphere needed for the work up to the love making with an impeccable dexterity.</u> They set the pace of the relationship and never give up. The partners are very content with this attitude and hardly ever have a reason to complain. The only glitch, however, is that in setting up the scene, the Leo <u>may become a little too overwhelming</u> for the partner. He/she might forget that the partner might be a little shy and the situation might be too hot to handle. Thus it is sometimes necessary for the Leo to supress his/her need to be appreciated and noticed all the time, even though it is his/her prime priorities.<br />Career<br />Leos need a profession where they can express themselves fully, shine in a way that all can see, and show of their talent. Even if they have hardly any opportunity to show their talent, they will be happy to just show their work, and<u> be appreciated and noticed for it.</u> A backend job with hardly any responsibilities and total isolation is not their cup of tea. They<u> do not mind if they are made to work in a library or a department store, or made a receptionist at a desk, they want a job where they feel someone is directly benefitting from their services, and also receive accolades and admiration from him for the work they have done.</u><br />So their basic objective is to make life a little easier for atleast a few people. And even with all the need for appreciation and commendation, <u>they have this personal yardstick of doing well, and they have to cross that minimum. If not, they will suffer from depression and restlessness</u>. Of course, these bouts keep coming in their lives, when they feel everything is just falling apart and that they are of no use to the society, but t<u>here&rsquo;s no one better at coming out of such states than them</u>. And when they&rsquo;re out, they will be alive and kicking as ever, and they will go out and make things happen.<br />Another remarkable characteristic of a Leo is his/her <u>insistence on doing things properly and without flaw</u>. Leos hate amateurs and <u>strive hard at achieving high standards in their output</u>. Whatever their career might be, they show this quality to the fullest and their superiors take notice of this. They soon rise in influence and then boss around people working under them to show perfection and professionalism. They do not want to do things properly, t<u>hey need to do things properly</u> so that people may take notice. Leos would love nothing more than to stand out as an example. Leos, however, do not shine in time-consuming jobs that they find unnecessary and annoying. And if their superior is, according to them, stupid and incompetant, and demands being sucked up to, then the Leo <u>will be the first to give it to him in the face, without caring about the job. They need appreciation and opportunity, but not at the cost of their honour!<br /><br /></u>All right, comparatively I'd have to say that I do fit Leo better. It's not a perfect fit - I don't think anyone is ever a perfect fit - but it's a hell of a lot closer than the damn Virgo. Egotistical and proud? Me? Hell yes! Two things that have always mattered a great deal to me are my pride and my honor. Makes more sense to be the lion, really. My Chinese Zodiac sign for the Rat (Earth Rat specifically, apparently) also seems to fit me pretty damn well. Rat-Lion, lol.&nbsp;<u><br type=""_moz"" /></u></span></lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""mostly just about ALA""><span style=""font-size: smaller; "">Hurray for the new year? Time will tell. Hopefully, though. But I'm honestly not holding my breath since each year has, for the most part, been somehow as bad or worse than the one before. Building up to an apocalypse?&nbsp;<br /><br />Meh.&nbsp;<br /><br />At any rate, nothing much is new. ALA has come and gone. I actually had a lot of fun there. It was nice to be productive, or at least feel like I had things to do to be productive, rather than retreating to the room halfway through the day and generally staying there. There was a small snag with said room, but it was all cleared up. All the new sashes and armbands for Cosplay Chess got finished, despite my stupid mistakes on them. The board was finally returned. For once we didn't actually watch the game and instead went to Stan's panel. Spent some time running around in Tron and ruining most pictures with all the reflectiveness. Kim's boob battle with Minion Jackie was epic. <br /><br />I spent most of the con bouncing between Kim and my usual friends, and Danny and the JAC. Jack always seems to be busy and productive, and since I didn't want to feel like I was wasting any con time sitting around in the room or something in boredom - especially since it looks like I won't be going to the usual number of cons this year, I wanted to get the most out of it - I followed him and the others around. I have realized that I miss the JAC people, and actually have a little regret that I wasn't able to be more active. I saw them at cons, and I knew them, but I didn't <em>know</em> them as anything beyond passing acquaintances. Now, through Danny, I'm getting to know everyone a bit better and finding that I like knowing them. I'm making an active effort to socialize and be more involved. Maybe it's just because I've gotten so restless from all the inactivity, but I actually find myself wanting to be more involved for once. So I'm making the effort.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that Kim didn't get overtly mad at me over the course of the con [which maybe I shouldn't say, because you're probably reading this? But it's true, and I appreciate it. I don't know if I upset you, I tried not to, but I do sincerely appreciate the lack of conflict between us].&nbsp;<br /><br />Scavenger Hunt went.... relatively well. Apparently we weren't very clear about some things, which annoyed some people. But we took notes and will try to do better next year. At least it wasn't bad for our first try. I feel bad that Katie woke up so early to skype with us and we ended up not even using her questions. I had meant to offer the extra credit trivia in the original announcement and had forgotten, and by the time I got skype up it was too late. At least it was nice talking to her a bit. Working for Costume Repair backstage with Minion had actually been really fun. Somehow, it was nice running around taking care of everyone, several of which were our friends.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm still a little peeved at Jenny for the whole SNSD fiasco. I hadn't really wanted to wear the costume, but I did it for the group. JenPan was sick, but came and paid for parking anyway, for the group. Alex came and paid for a room and parking, for the group. I asked for multiple confirmations about our flashmob plan. What happened? We all found each other and she was the only one missing because she ran off and got into Baccano cosplay. Leaving the group kind of hanging. And didn't tell me, even though I'd been texting her and asking for updates multiple times over the evening. Yeah, pretty sure I'm done with that costume now.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ended up sickly again by sunday. Pretty sure it was a combination of dehydration (I tend to forget to drink water, and most of the water available was cold so I couldn't drink it anyway), sleep deprivation (I only got 3-4 hours of sleep a night, despite going to bed early, because somehow I couldn't manage to settle down and sleep), and the stale air of being in an enclosed environment for more than a few days without fresh air circulation. I felt better eventually, mainly after I'd been outside long enough to feel hungry instead of queasy, and then food helped me feel well enough to chug a pint of water. By monday I was tired, but not so sickly. I really hate my body, and that it still takes so little to push it over the edge. Also, I was somehow stressing myself to anxiety again without really realizing it at the time and without a clear reason why. Emotions also suck.&nbsp;<br /><br />At any rate, mostly better now. For the time being at least. Back to the normal, which is a whole lot of nothing. Mostly just trying to find things to do to fill the emptiness and unfortunate overabundance of free time. Will probably be visiting Danny most fridays, except when I go bother Dawn so we can finally head to In Cahoots -sober-.&nbsp;<br /><br />I wonder if it's weird that I feel like I don't really have a reason to visit my brothers anymore now that Luke's in Scotland? Pat's still there, and Elyse. Pat and I barely interact, and while I get along with Elyse, it feels strange to visit her. Also sucks that Pat's now getting a divorce, mostly because of Madison. And apparently Chantel hooked up with one of his now es-friends, so that's kinda suspicious. Poor Pat. Anyway, feels strange for Luke to be gone. I haven't heard from him at all, except to make sure that I'll still do classes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sadly, I can't think of anything else to say to update. Life is just that boring I guess. For now, I'll go back to huddling in a little ball of pain as cramps try to crush my spine for the next day or two. I fucking hate being female.&nbsp;</span></lj-cut>"

As it was, she avoided everyone most of the day. Around dinner time though she let me take her up to the room to eat and I played trains with her. After opening presents (it took a while to convince her to come down and open anything), she ended up getting hurt by one of the toys and since it was dear daddy's fault, she let me take her back upstairs. I got her to stop crying (how the hell did I manage that?) and we ended up playing. For over two hours.&nbsp;<br />This girl is a born hostess. I think cooking will be therapeutic for her in the future. She had a bunch of plastic foods and a little kitchen thing, so she spent a few hours &quot;cooking&quot; for me with intermittent &quot;coffee&quot;. I wasn't allowed to escape, she'd follow me down and call me back and force me to sit by the &quot;kitchen&quot;. It was really adorable, if taxing because I had no idea what the hell to do and I'm not well-versed in baby talk yet. Still... she played with me! To the extent that she refused to let anyone else play. Even gave me hugs and kisses. So.... I'm happy. I think that really is what made Christmas for me this year. Everything else is just standard, but to have my niece actually like me for the first time... that's something special.&nbsp;<br />It was a good day.&nbsp;<br /><br />And now MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE &lt;3<br /><br />Edit: Also, apparently Ken's only a brat around me. My dad said he heard him talk more last night than in the last five years combined, and mother said he was all chatty in the kitchen, and when I was upstairs with Madison... But he was bratty whenever I was around. So wtf? Mrrr -.-;&nbsp;</span>"

Played at the arcade (Rambo is amazingly lulzy) and went down to the beach to go in the water for a while, playing around and diving in the waves. After that we went back up to the Promenade to find some lunch and walk around, checking out the game store (pity there were no trick dice, I've convinced him to cosplay Duke Devlin) and the book store (haha Farscape comic!&nbsp;*nerd*), then eventually went back to the beach to just lie down and relax. Eventually gave up when the breezes got too chilly and headed back to his place. Would have probably passed out, but Jack called and we all trooped out to go see this Hip Hop Orchestra concert thing in downtown. Was fun, mostly for hanging out, but the show itself was meh. Too much hip hop, not enough orchestra. The parts that did have stronger orchestra were cool though. <br /><br />Today was car maintenance adventures. Poked and prodded mother to get up and going so we could get started, finally succeeded around 10:30 or so. Got stuff for the cars, headed out to the studio, and got started. Turns out the Autozone had given me the wrong brake pads, so we had to go back to another and get the right kind. Did my brakes, my oil, air filter, and a couple other random things while we were at it. Oil change on the van was considerably less time. Came back in time to watch True Blood with my dad, and then we all went out to Outback where I treated my dad and Ben (really hard to think of him as my step-dad... it breaks my brain a little) to dinner... Mother and Jill were on their own XD And now I'm blobbing from food coma. <br /><br />Tomorrow will be another adventure. Gotta go to Costco and get new tires (haha, so bald &gt;.&gt;;; ) then drive down to see my brothers in Fountain Valley. First to see Luke and take care of some bank stuffs, then back to their apartment to visit Pat and Madison until Elyse and Luke get home, then dinner... and then I get to drive back. I&nbsp;have a feeling I will be exhausted this week. I want more kitty-cuddles, lol. </lj-cut><br /></span>"

I'm just going to cover November because I'm lazy. And my memory doesn't really go back much farther than that. 
</span><lj-cut text=""Covering November or so...""><span style=""font-size: small;"">So... hmm. Kim and I went to PMX. That was good times, because I got to see several friends and we did the CosFest thing and somehow (I don't think the shock will ever wear off) managed to win Best in Show. Yay! I still want to touch up that costume for ALA next month though, but whatever. It wasn't bad for being rushed. Got busy somehow around Thanksgiving. It was my brother's birthday two days before (which.. seriously where the fuck is the present I ordered?!) and I tried to make him a Red Velvet Cake from scratch. Hands down, worst thing I ever made. Somehow it not only looked like play-doh, it tasted like it too. He has now dubbed it the best worst present ever. I agree. Ah well, at least I tried xD I think I give up on cake-from-scratch for now. Then I had two Thanksgivings, because Ken wanted to do his own thing this year, but I also wanted to do the family thing.. So we did ours on wednesday and the family thing on thursday. Friday I hung out with Kelleigh who was in town for a bit and had good times. She taught me how to knit! :D! After that I went to Kim's, Elyse picked us up and we went to my brothers' place to all head out to Vegas. 
Starting off, we (me, Kim and Elyse) made a drinking game out of all the slow ass fucking Priuses we passed on the road (total of 12, btw, most of which were in LA). We got there kinda late, checked into the Sahara, and did a little gambling and drinking and the like, mostly at the Sahara and Slots-A-Fun. Found out from a cab driver that it's a good thing we didn't go to Caeser's Palace like Luke wanted because there was a shooting like a half an hour after we decided not to go. Goody. 
Saturday we hung out, gambled, yadayada (Pat was hungover, sucker) until we went to Treasure Island to see the Cirque du Soleil show Mystere. I love Cirque. Seriously. So fucking awesome. I even ninja'd a few pics before they got mad at me. Someday I will see all the shows! Before and after that we were hanging out at the Kahunaville bar, drinking huge margaritas and daiqueris (Pineapple rum in a strawberry daiqueri is pretty gross btw) and having fun with the hot bartender from Milan. They had some skills show things (that we caught both before and after Cirque) that I killed my voice screaming for our bartender for. Looked awesome. And he poured the most delicious mango rum down our throats that I've ever had. Tasted like fruit juice. Soo fucking good. Anyway, after that we were supposed to have dinner at the Rio buffet. That failed because it was after 10 and it closed. We wandered around looking for food, eventually stopped at a restaurant in a hotel (The Mirage?) that had the monorail that we could then take back. I think we even made an attempt to gamble a bit but went up pretty early. 
Sunday, Kim and I ironically found a 24hr diner in our hotel, making our search the night before pointless. Oh well. We gambled a little more, then left for a buffet at the Bellagio... which made Kim and I really regret having breakfast. But it was good and we all gorged ourselves on food. Voted to walk around more before heading home because we were so full. Took pictures at the &quot;Welcome to Las Vegas sign&quot;, being dorks, then at the outlet mall nearby for a little shopping. Then it was traffic ride on the way home, with us emphasizing our nerdiness by the fact that we had Elyse's iPhone hooked up to the stereo playing Star Trek... and then Kim and I sync'd up our ipods to play it too with the car's stereo for audio. And also several hours of playing Scribblenauts. Yes, my family is full of dorks 8D! 
Anyway, it was really fun and I want to go back again some day. With more money and a knowledge of how to actually play the games. Figuring it out as I went didn't go so well xD; 

I spent the rest of the last week mostly lazing about and recovering from first sleep deprivation and then the epic cramps that have been kicking my ass even through pain killers. So now I'm resisting the temptation to want to make a Tegami Bachi costume (those hats are so damn cute) and focusing my attention back on 666 Satan for motivation to get off my ass and work. Also, practicing knitting for the damn Soul Eater Spartoi jacket collars (who puts a knit collar on a blazer-type jacket? Seriously?) . One more month or so until ALA.. really need to get start

"" class=""ljcut"">Sometimes you have one of those moments that makes you realize... wow, I'm sad. I had that thought this morning. After I woke up from a dream about <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em>. I wish I was kidding. Seriously. To make matters worse, it also had 5D's. I had a fucking <em>crossover</em> in my dream. Complete with children's card game duels (using sexy female monster cards to get all over each other, of course) and ultimately... hot chocolate. So weird.

My only real conclusion is that I've quite possibly watched too much Abridged series lately *gasp!* and it's been too long since I groped some girls....

If I were to be really optimistic though, I could blame it on the chocolate I ate last night and the fact that an email about a YGO con gathering was the last email I read before I went to sleep. Still, I think this is actually more disturbing than when I had dreams about RO...

I'll respond by asking you five questions so I can get to know you better (which means preferably people in my f-list that hasn't done this meme with me much, you know who you are).
Update your journal with the answers to the questions.
Include this explanation in the post and offer to ask other people questions.</strong>

<div text=""Questions from Stan"" class=""ljcut""><strong>1. It's your birthday once again, and someone *most likely Jason* wants to buy you any one drink. What drink do you choose?</strong>
I probably tell the bartender to surprise me with &quot;Something fruity and girly and doesn't have tequila&quot;. 

<strong>2. Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?
</strong>Oh geez, gotta ask the hard question, huh? I don't normally really think ahead like that. Uhm, honestly.. either I've actually succeeded in getting credentials and am a teacher, or I'm still trying to find my place in the working world. I expect to still be with Ken, somewhere or other, and still have my social life revolve around cosplay. Beyond that, I have no idea. 

<strong>3. With the exception of Japan, name one country you want to travel to. 
</strong>Huh... Probably something in Europe, one of the countries I have heritage from like Norway or Ireland. Probably Ireland 'cause they have sexy accents and drink like crazy ~

<strong>4. One movie that impressed you a lot this year?</strong>
Bloody hell, I can't even remember what the last thing I saw was (oh wait, Astroboy with you.. ok, the last one before that) let alone everything in the year, lol. If I could remember, I'm sure I could pick one out... 

<strong>5. Kamen Rider question time! What's your feeling on Fang/Joker form?
</strong>Zomg, wut? I haven't even seen it yet! O_O *runs to google* NOOOO!! PHILIP!! DDDD:!!! ... it looks cool, not so big on that spikey shoulder thing, but the B/W theme is nifty. Didn't see anything about what its actual power is, besides placeholder. Replacing Philip though makes me sadpanda T_______T Do. Not. Approve. <endljcut></endljcut></div>"

"event","Went to see Surrogates with Ken today. Good movie overall, but one thing bugged me that I kept thinking about the whole damn time. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""My take on the concept of Surrogates"">So I&nbsp;assume everyone has seen the previews and knows the overall concept of the movie. People walk around in sophisticated robots so much that they barely leave their houses anymore unless inside their Surrie. The thing that struck me about this was something they stated early on, how once Surrogates were widely used by the general populous crime and discrimination and yadayada dropped rapidly; how problems we've had for ages ceased to exist almost overnight. <br /><br />WTF<br /><br />Seriously. I personally would think that the concept of Surrogates would actually increase crime, rather than decrease it. Think about it, Murderers could get off on the feeling of killing without actually killing anyone. The worst crime would be Vandalism, since a Surrogate is only a machine. They even have the increased speed and power and whatnot from being in a machine rather than a fleshy body. Granted, you could say that the visuals recorded by all Surries could be used as a deterrent to the criminal getting caught after the crime, but even that's a stretch.. because it establishes that the physical appearance of the Surrie is easy to change and they're instead identified by their chips. So that doesn't really make it that easy to identify a criminal by visual record after all. And it's not like most criminals don't actually plan to commit crimes without getting caught... I mean, I'm sure that if someone plans a crime, they're going to plan to try to not get caught and thus probably make plans to circumvent the visual recording or whatever. Not to mention just plain old theft and whatnot, things that aren't against another person at all. Seriously, who honestly thinks that by giving people a advanced robot toy to control will STOP&nbsp;people from committing crimes?&nbsp;Rather than &quot;Sweet, think of all the cool shit I can do with this 8D!&quot; ... Yeah, no. That part of the movie just kinda broke my brain and had me scratching my head for the rest of the movie, sadly keeping me from putting my full attention to everything else that was going on as I tried to wrap my head around the wtfery of that concept. <br /><br />Taking away the risk and dangers in life does not stop crimes. I would think it would just make them more bold. Just.. ugh. That was one of the most retarded things I've heard in a while. Anyone else's thoughts on the concept? x_X; </lj-cut> <br />"

"event","YAY!&nbsp;Got to go out and spend time with Amy, Tracy, Michelle, and Amy's boyfriend Steve. I haven't seen the sisters in like.. ten or eleven years. It was awesome. We met up at Dave and Busters, had some late lunch/early dinner, some drinks, and played some games.. with more occasional drinks. Amy won a crapload of tickets, it was fun. Luke and Pat helped. They got like 1k each and she won three times and got 3k. Good times. We ended up going to see The Hangover, got more drinks (just so you know, Shark Bite is strong but tastes nasty.. I got Kamikaze shots instead). Seeing that while inebriated was both ironic and entertaining. I laughed muchly. Good movie. At any rate, I'm still a little drunk while I write this. Seeing everyone was awesome, Amy and I are freakishly similar, which I wouldn't have expected given how different we were ten years ago. But very much awesomeness nonetheless. Tracy seems more laid back, Michelle is about the same. Steve is nifty, I approve of him. Overall it was a really good day and I'm really happy, and not just because of all the alcohol consumed. I had a lot of fun and am really happy to have caught up with them all. I really hope I can continue to see them and do stuff with them together in the future.

And he doesn't like people coming over and intruding on his zen space, so he kept trying to make sure I came over when he wasn't home. Apparently he likes avoiding people more than spending time with me, but most of his attitude was from me not being around. Eh, whatever. So once they were in town I took charge of Share since Kim's mom won't let that many people stay over. I worked on the damn bone helms - which thwarted me SO&nbsp;HARD&nbsp;that I almost wanted to cry at one point - and whatnot things. Had to pull an all-nighter on tuesday night to finish sewing things up. Naturally didn't manage to sleep much on the drive up on wednesday. Our detour up to 'frisco was nice and scenic, was nice seeing the forest and ocean and such, but took so long we didn't even make it to frisco at all. Postponed the visit for friday instead. Went back to San Jose and checked in and all that jazz. Thursday.. I actually don't really remember what we did, to be honest, besides the fact that we worked on stuff in the room and watched movies and went to go see Terminator: Salvation with Calvin and Kelleigh. Entertaining, but not particularly great. Marcus T__T &lt;3<br /><br />As of friday when con started... also don't remember that much. Finished some stuff up, ran a little late trying to get to artist's alley, Kim went ahead of me but I met up around setup time. Stayed down there until about 5:15 before packing up to leave because Dani and Dan were almost there. Kim got mad at me for leaving, despite saying we should pack up and leave at 5, but what else is new. Met up with Dani and Dan, hung out in the room a little, went out to dinner, ate some Indian curry - which was later to be a big mistake on my part - and continued to chat about in our room until they left. We worked on more stuff, watched more movies, and started our drinking night. For the record, Absinthe is NASTY&nbsp;BEYOND&nbsp;WORDS. I never want to drink it again. It also constitutes mixing drinks.. also a bad idea. So I found that curry +&nbsp;absinthe + a quarter bottle of vodka and triple sec = bad bad times. First hangover ever!&nbsp;Not fun, but still worth it. Despite having spent an hour and a half in the bathroom puking that night. Ironic thing is that the point of all this was to watch Dragon Ball Evolution - because the only way it could be enjoyable is wasted - and I&nbsp;don't even remember seeing most of the movie. Yeah, fail.&nbsp; <br /><br />Saturday... was a blur of hangover unpleasantness. Woke up nauseous. Share had her puking fit that morning, mine was out of my system already. Heartrate was racing and I was shaking, which was honestly a little disturbing. Took a while to get some food down - lunchables - before we started to feel better. Then she ate a bagel and I had a sip - a sip! - of soda and we felt like shit again. So we pretty much starved all day just so we could crawl out of bed and into Soul Eater costumes because I refused to stay in bed all day. Met up with Cal and Kell again, who brought Chris along this time. Then met with Collin, Share's soul-twin brother. Hung out a bit, went out to dinner at Red Robin - I think it was, since we couldn't find a Rainforest Cafe in town - and Mai and Khai met us there. Nice long wait to get a table for 11 people. That was also.... eh. Awkward, I guess. Two of us were hungover, half the group didn't know the rest, and Kim and Kathryn were tired and angry at me for picking somewhere so far away, or so that was the impression I got. Stev was just in too much pain, I think, to really care. At least after eating this time we felt better rather than worse. Worked on stuff a little more and then I'm pretty sure I passed out. <br /><br />Sunday I actually did stuff!&nbsp;Got up, got dressed, went to do Bleach Chess. I, of course, tripped on my heels and fell on my ass, thus breaking my hair ornament in several places and had to glue it badly back together before I even got out of the hotel. Lame. But at least it was salvageable. I got killed by Share in Soi Fon.. that was also ironic. Tripped and fell, tried to grab for balance, pulled her down instead, but somehow didn't break my hair thing again. Couldn't manage frisbee very well in the heels, the gathering was... a little disappointing because AS&nbsp;ALWAYS&nbsp;they focus on captains and shinigami and arrancar get neglected for shoots. So we took a few of our own, Jason got yelled at for climbing trees again, and I went inside to turn in a phone someone forgot and stopped for pictures at this guy's setup in the lobby. Got out of costume, rested a little, actually changed into Naruto for a bit to go to Dealer's Hall and whatnot and get our stuff out of Artists Alley. After that we went for dinner at Denny's, then we came back and packed up and then played some Rock Band for a while, which was also very fun. <br /><br />Monday was just the rather uneventful trip home.Leg room was nice to have. Detoured to give my brother back his laptop, continued to Kim's long enough to unpack and trade luggage, then went home. Tuesday Share and I went to Victoria's Secret to trade in the undies she bought me for a smaller size so I could model them properly. Yeah, amazing how hard it is to find XS&nbsp;in the stores. My choices were pathetically limited. But we found a few things, took a few pictures, then left back to Kim's so that Share and Stev could head back to AZ. Didn't want them to leave, but no choice. Honestly, overall I had more fun hanging out with friends than at the actual con this year. Which is what makes it kind of strange and disconnected to think about. But to redeem Ken that he's not as much of an ass as he seems to be so often, as soon as I got home again he dragged me to bed and cuddled until he left for work. Lots of cuddles since my return, so I can't complain. Now I'm just going to relax a bit before I get working on finishing stuff for AX.<br /><br />And now, on a totally different note.. about Naruto 449. What. The. Fuck. <br /><br />Seriously. SERIOUSLY?! You expect me to believe that Pain spent a very large portion of his life plotting and planning and doing all this shit for his ideal, and after ONE&nbsp;LITTLE&nbsp;SPEECH&nbsp;from a teenage boy he'd been trying to kill, he just up and decides &quot;Oh, my bad. sorry. Here, let me pull a Phoenix Pinion out of my eye and revive everyone in a totally bullshit deus ex machina move. I'll just invalidate my life and dreams for your sake now, take care!&quot; .... It makes me want to scream with the utter lameness of it all. Now, I know that it's Kishimoto's series and yada yada don't complain about what he does with his own shit. But as a reader, the person he is trying to impress and get money from, I keep being consistently disappointed. He seriously needs some pointers from his brother about decent storytelling. I'd stop reading Naruto, but I have a problem with quitting things once I've started. Now it's just a trainwreck; pretty terrible (most of the time) but I can't seem to stop watching (reading). It's just.. it's just.. .it was so TERRIBLE!&nbsp;Besides the completely unbelievable change of heart Nagato has, besides the rather lame resolution to the conflict, I honestly wanted people to die and STAY&nbsp;DEAD!&nbsp;Is that too much to ask?&nbsp;For Naruto NOT&nbsp;to become like Dragonball where it doesn't really matter because you have people like Shenlong!Nagato to make things right?&nbsp;Now Naruto's decision to not become like Nagato despite everything they both endured is now invalidated because he will not have to suffer the pain of losing those dearest to him (besides Jiraiya). Way to not have that lesson stick. &quot;Oh, you're not going to become a bitter young shinobi bent on world destruction like me?&nbsp;Well then, let me just take back everything I did so that it doesn't matter anyway.&quot; Bullshit. And.. I can't even begin to explain my irritation and disappointment that Kakashi lives. Of course he lives. Fucking perfect character. I hate perfect characters. Not to say that I hate Kakashi, he's a fun character. Just too perfect. I would have been happier if he died. It would have made him more human. But noooo. <br /><br />Oh Naruto, how you disappoint me so. I hope the series is ending soon so the frustration of following this despite its growing absurdity will also end. Train wreck. Epic train wreck. &nbsp; </lj-cut><br />"

I knew there was a reason that I never make plans and such, and why I always try to shaft the planning of things off on other people.

I try, for once, to make a plan for my birthday and have a sort of party thinggy. I just happen to choose the one weekend my best friend is busy and the one weekend for a month that my husband is working, one of several weekends where my other best friend can't get the day off. Well fine, can't have my husband and two best friends but I can at least see other friends, right? Of course not. First a few of my friends are out of town, then one is busy with work and tests, then two more have their cars break down in the same week - thus there goes seeing any of my old classmates that I really miss. I am now left with two family members - brother and uncle -, a friend, and a small handful of coworker friends out of all the people I invited and wanted to spend time with. Let's hope the night is salvagable still and not a bust despite having less than half the people come. *sighs and tries not to be too morose about the failure*

I'm at that&nbsp;SPAZZ point now of ""omg it's almost con time and I'm not as finished with stuff as&nbsp;I'm supposed to be!"". Gloves are an annoying thing to have to make... I made one and am not even happy with it so going to try to make the other look better.. in which case I'll need to remake the first. I have to&nbsp;tear out and recut half of my dress, which pisses me off. I still have to get the boas and barretts for my&nbsp;veil and hair clips, so those things haven't even been started yet, along with my bouquet. I have to do all this in two weeks,&nbsp;as well as hopefully have time to finish Trunks touchups and to make Hiei. /rantrant

And I'm still tired x.x Saw a midnight showing of Iron Man on thursday - much awesomeness - which was fine, but then the going back over to Kim's friday, saturday, sunday, and tuesday.. I'm&nbsp;so tired I can barely manage to work on anything. Oddly enough, I'm getting less work done at Kim's than&nbsp;usual. If I wasn't already taking the days off for Fanime I'd be so tempted to take a couple off just to grind out the costumes.

"event","So my brother Patrick got married today! Huzzah! It's still kinda like.. whoa... because I always figured Luke would be the first to settle down, then Pat... and I would just plain never marry. Yeah, see how well that went.. I was the first to go and now Pat and Chantel are married and I can tease Luke for being the next one to go xD

Sometimes I feel kinda weird around Chantel's family though... Chantel's cool and all, and they're all nice people.. it's just awkward sometimes. The parents are really religious and I have to try to keep my mouth shut and not be snarky. I've already gotten weird looks from them before for saying smartass stuff that's so common in my family and among my friends. So instead I spent most of my time there with Luke when I wasn't helping, which I didn't have much of a choice in the matter of anyway... (the helping, I mean... I wouldn't really be allowed to not do anything.) So yeah, it was a slow and mostly boring day. But it's family, what can you do?

S'all well and good, finally got the dinner going with the pictures and toast and the whole shebang. And of course... saying grace *twitch* and Chantel's mother actually cried... gawd they make me feel awkward. And when earlier the topic of marriage came up and she was saying how ""it's a sacred thing"" and it's ""forever"" and people going into it without concern for all that... and I had to try SO HARD not to comment that it's really not that big of an issue and for me it wasn't much of a change from dating. You're either going to be together or you're not, a wedding doesn't make a difference in your relationship except in taxes. This is why I find it hard to be around them... I have to watch what I say to avoid offending. Normally I wouldn't care, but they're family of family so I have to make the effort. 

Stayed until nine when I decided I had paid my courtesy dues and was free to go home. And there was an accident on the 405 that made it a parking lot for a half hour or more. Literally. Most of the cars around me were in park or even turned off. Took an hour just to get to the 5. And then I saw a dog get hit under one of the overpasses a little ways before the 710. I saw it jump out, get hit, fly a little and tumble on the ground.. and then drove by it and saw it sprawled with it's jaw lolling broken and open. That was a little surreal and disturbing. 

And now as I write this I'm scared shitless of a spider running around on my desk. I'm going to go to bed now.. which is far away from my desk and hopefully the spider as well T___T I hate spiders!"

I can't handle playing against other people. With, sure. Against, no. I can't handle playing against my brothers, I can't handle playing against my best friends, and I can't handle playing against my internet gaming family either - there's no way I'll be able to handle playing against some jackass I barely know at work. <br /> <br /> I've been stuck playing Multiplayer for a few weeks now. Fine, whatever. Desyncs suck and so do a bunch of the other things, but in general to try to get through the game we both work towards the actual Victories. Jackass thinks is so cute to threaten to take over my civs all the time but at least he hadn't. <br /> <br /> Until today. WTF?! We were playing as TEAMS, not even in a versus game set, and the jackass ups and nukes me! NUKES!! And then thought it was so fucking hilarious that he could hardly get out the words ""come on, it was funny"". <br /> <br /> Yeah, not so much. I was not amused. <br /> <br /> In fact, as usual when I'm subjected to PvP of any kind, I started fucking shaking uncontrollably and it took massive effort not shake so hard that I couldn't keep playing. The effort usually makes me a) nearly hyperventilate until I have a headache, b) get very loud and violent, c) cry from the effort, or some combination thereof. Managed to get through the last 45 minutes or so without a breakdown, but driving home in traffic on the 101 while still shaking and trying to keep control was definitely Not Fun. <br /> <br /> At least now I'm home and can stop trying to control it and let it pass on its own. But I'm still so fucking pissed off. So tempted to demand getting put on Single Player. Hell, the other guy likes taking people over, let him play the jackass instead and let me play alone. If he attacks me one more time, I probably will... Gawd, I hate PvP so fucking much. <br /> <br /> And if one more person tells me ""calm down, it's just a game"" one more time, I'm going to kill 'em. <br /> </font></div></font>"

"event","Car accidents suck. 

I've come to the conclusion that my car hates me. Or, more likely, Mistubishi in and of itself hates me, given that the last car accident was also in one. Car accident - broken window - car accident... Yeah, I think it's safe to say Mitsubishi doesn't like me. 

So basically, I was driving home from dropping off a pattern at Kim's, driving on the 134 West. At the point where it crosses the 5 and like 3 lanes start merging together... all the cars were suddenly backed up. I saw this and started braking. Realized I wasn't slowing enough, braked some more... kept at it as the panic of OMIGAWDI'MNOTSTOPPING! set in until I was flooring the brakes... at which point I guess they locked up and I slid into the stopped car in front of me. Suckage. 

Luckily I slowed down enough that the damage wasn't TOO bad.. bumpers were screwed, a bit of head/taillights and my hood and her trunk were dented in a bit. Could have been worse if I hadn't managed to slow down. Because yeah... I HAD seen it and I HAD tried to stop and it was really damn scary knowing that you're trying to stop and just... not stopping. I think that was worse than the accident itself. No one was hurt, worst is a small bruise on my knee where I jerked up and hit the steering column.. which is kinda wonky now and doesn't like to release my key from the ignition. 

At least the lady I hit was nice, and I feel so bad for hitting her. We sat and talked for the hour or so it took for the police dude to show up. Her friend came and I called Ken and they respectively went with us as we left to make sure we'd be ok. I also called in to work that I wasn't coming because of the accident... which I also feel kinda bad for because my boss really needs people this week since we're in the last stretch for submission, and I'm on the card team... and oddly pretty good at my assignment. 

Of course, I had gotten that not-so-subtle scolding from my dad that I drive too fast and whatnot... and what really sucks about it is that I would have felt better if I had been being reckless. Then it'd be easier to kick myself and be like ""well, this is what you get for being an idiot."" Knowing that I do drive kinda fast, it somehow makes it worse that I actually WASN'T at this time. I KNOW that road home like the back of my hand, I know cars slow up on those turns and I know that the lanes merge so I always slow down. I know that I should have had enough time to stop... I should have, but the car just slid and there was nothing I could do about it. Slid, not skid.. not even any tire marks on the road... felt like I was on water or something. So yeah.. It would have been easier to kick myself for being stupid and take this all as just desserts if I had been, but no... I should have been able to stop, and it just didn't happen. So frustrating. 

So now I can just hope that the insurance rates don't go up too badly and that my car damage isn't too bad... since I think I only have Liability so I'll be the one flipping the bill to fix my own car. I'm just hoping that it's mostly superficial, because actually damaging the frame... oh gawd x.x; 

*sigh* Mistubishi hates me."

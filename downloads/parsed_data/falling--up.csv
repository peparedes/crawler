"event","So my throat is healing, slowly, but at least it's healing.  My mom decided that the pain medicine given to me was apparently for the family.  She didn't realize that it wasn't cough syrup.  
I hate my work.  I hate the people.  It sucks so bad...but I guess it's money.  Money's all that matters.
I'm afraid that my sugery won't be scheduled until the fall term starts, and then it will conflict with my classes.  I don't want to miss any classes and it might force me to.  Worries me a bit.
I need to get this Anna Nalick's CD...it's not really my type of music but I'm addicted now.  Music is music.
Anyway, pointless entry, as always.

"event","I've realized something in the past few months...and I've been told that it is true.  I get myself all wrapped up in these situations and I tend to live in the moment.  I spin webs and webs around myself, without really ever realizing it.  I put so much effort into reaching the most impossible goals that they just kind of consume me.  And once I finally reach them, I end up realizing that they are not at all what I desire.  I get tangled in webs and end up spinning out of control.  This is where my friends come in.  All those phone calls recieved at 2 in the morning with me on the line unable to get myself and my life back together are caused by my recklessness.  I appreciate the friends that help me put myself back together from day to day.  
I know what I'm doing when I'm spinning the webs, but for some odd reason I can't help it.  I love to live and hate being bored and alone.  It's like I can see it happening, but I have no control over myself.  Over my own mind.  Without my friends I'd be a broken mess...

"event","Well I just got discharged from the emergency room...I was there for a little over 24 hours.  Here's a shortened story: I woke up with a pre-existing fever of 103 that began two days before, only this particular morning I couldn't breathe.  It felt like my air passage way was kind of closing slowly, and my voice was very, very muffled.  It was the worst pain a ""sore"" throat had ever given me.  I knew something was wrong so I woke ap my mom and waited for her to get ready to take me to the ER.  We got there my fever was still 103 and I got in right away.  They immediately took my blood, hooked up and IV and pumped me with steroids, fluids, morphine, and other things that I can't remember the name.  The doctor came in and told me that she saw that there was basically a blister filled with puss on the outside and inside of my tonsil.  So she went in there with a syringe poked at and tried to suck it up--this failed and hurt miserably.  Next an ENT specialist (ear nose and throat) came down much later and numbed my tonsil with 2 cc's of gel and made an incision in it with a razor blade.  He then preceeded to use a pair of medical scissors to squeeze the rest of the puss out.  After both mini-surgeries I proceeded to spit blood up for an hour or so afterwards.  In between and after the mini-surgeries were many many doses of steroids, anti-biotic, constant fluid, and morphine.  In fact my last morphine dose was at 6:00 am this morning.  

It seems to be healing up fine, and my voice is almost back to normal.  Except one of two things happens in this case:
1.  It could heal right and go away and remain away.
2.  It could come right back, get another abscess, and I'll have to repeat this procedure. And then once all the swelling was gone, I would have to get my tonsils removed.  

Unfortunately, the latter circumstance is the more common one.  So keep your fingers crossed.

I would like to thank everyone who came and visited me.  It was greatly appreciated.  Everybody knows how well I do cramped up in a stupid little room all day.

Anyway, for the time being, all's well.  And that's all that matters."

"event","It's been a year since high school, and even longer for some.  Do you ever think about it anymore?  Well today I was...and I usually think about it in one of two ways.  One way: I think about all the people that I disliked seeing and waking up at the buttcrack of dawn.  I no longer have to attend 8 classes in a row.  The other way: Think about all of the people that you haven't spoken to in a year.  There are so many of them.  It's a difficult change for me, just knowing that high school friendships fade so quickly.  All that time and effort that you put into constructing all your relationships with other people essentially (most likely) was a waste.  I mean sure, you may still be hanging on by a couple threads--but how long will that really last?  What about marriage and a family if you have one?  Will it last through that?  In all honesty that is a rare circumstance.  But what are you without friends?

I realize that she doesn't like me, and I admit it, I really don't like her.  I don't like what she's let her life become or how she treats people, especially family.  But it is one thing to not like somebody, and a whoooole other thing to try to convince the people that love you to leave you.  I don't think that I did anything to deserve this, I, for instance, did not pull any of this shit on her.  I'm really actually hurt right now, and it takes a lot to actually hurt me.  I don't know what to do or say, and I don't really want to be confrontational.  But seeing as I see her everyday, eventually it will have to surface.

"event","Well today was certainly the most interesting day that I've had in awhile...I got into a car accident on 696.  Here's what happened:
I was driving in the lane next to the left lane, and a red SUV was in teh left lane.  The lady driving it didn't use a turn signal and failed to check her blind spot--she moved over and smashed into my right front end sending me flying into the lane next to me.  This happened around 8 am this morning, so there was morning work traffic.  The lane that I was heading into due to the impact was occupied, so I swerved to avoid the cars while slamming on my brakes.  This caused me car to kind of spin and it smashed, basically head on, into the cement barrier/wall.  This was the most terrifying experience ever.  And the lady who actually caused the accident and hit my car drove off, and I never got a chance to get her plate number.  Wonderful, huh?  Good news is, the only damage it caused my body was my head smashing into the steering wheel and my ankle catching some weird impact.  The damage to my car isn't nearly as bad as it sounds like it should be.  I guess I got lucky in a way...well I mean, I'm still alive.

Anyway, pretty crazy day, don't ya think?  I'm not afraid to drive but I havent really had the desire to get in my car all day.  Just looking at it makes me kind of queasy.

Time for me to go to bed.  Goodnight all."

Here's one shot to being on the outside.

I'm really, really wishing that I was anywhere but home right now.  I can't stand this city.  Why didn't I apply to go away to college?

So far Macomb classes prove to be as easy as highschool...and I guess as much was to be expected.  It's going to be hard to not fail in the pact I made about not missing one day of class.  I mean, c'mon, we spent almost an entire english class on reading an essay defining ""macho"".  What a freakin' joke.

So it woudn't be enough time to enjoy it that much, but it would be enough time to get me feeling dirty all night.  Plus, I'm in a skirt.  So yeah, I'm sitting here alone again in the dorm room.

"event","Well, this weekend I'm making my rounds of all the near universities...last night was Michigan, tonight is Western, and tomorrow is State.  I'm sure I'm in store for a fun weekend.

I had my first two days at Macomb, and oh my god I can't tell you what a joke all my classes are.  I seriously am afraid of college now because it's going to be so easy, that I may just have a problem showing up.  Hopefully I can maintain some type of dedication to school...hopefully.
Just for instance, in my English class we are going to study paragraphs...you know topic sentence and closing sentence relating to one another.  I did that in fucking elementary.  It's such a joke
And my first day of Math class we did factoring...and the students actually didn't understand it!  Just horrible.

Anyway, it is hot as hell in this dorm room cause Sean forgot a fan, and I have been constantly sweating.  Hot, isn't it?  Hot weather makes me cranky sometimes.

I have so much time to kill (actually only about an horu left) before Sean gets back from his gay RA training.  I set up his room for him because before it was a fucking mess.  
I guess I'll go walk around Ann Arbor, again, for a little bit.  See ya later."

Well, yes, yes I do.  Best friend wise...happened so many times I can't even count.  In fact, it happened this year.  (or was that over a boy? hmmm, makes no difference) 

How about the best friend I had growing up?  She replaced me with the, well shall we say...little one.  Or was that because, so you may have heard, I committed many, many uncessary lies?  Perhaps, perhaps (though not likely) I did, but only because I got so used to telling them to cover up the ultimate one--but that's only a sidenote.

How about boyfriend wise...I remember one time in ninth grade when I was replaced ""secretly"" (and we all know how well junior high secrets are kept) by a good friend.  


Such an interesting question isn't it?  Go ahead, hit me with another good one--I'm sure I've got an answer.

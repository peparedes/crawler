"event","i am finally done with shopping...thank god. i am so ready to get this holiday over with...ugh. dont get me wrong, i love christmas, but i am so tired of all the political correctness. all the ""happy holidays"" and telling little kids that they can't perform at their school pageant because they chose songs about Christ. im tired of it. this is a RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY. everyone knows it so stop trying to secularize everything. its bullcrap. a school in LA banned an elemetary school choir because they wanted to sing ""Joy to the World"" and ""Silent Night"" but they allowed anything that was from hanukkah or kwanza (a made up holiday). so basically anything christian is banned. and do you know what that is?? it is called RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION. did you know that it takes courage for someone just to say ""Merry Christmas""? yeah, christians are beaten down because they don't include everyone in their greetings. if you want to tell me ""happy holidays"" fine, do so, but dont expect me to give you the same greeting. This is Christmas, in celebration of the birth of My Savior. I dont care about the secular end of the holy-day. Would youi like to know what i do with my christmas morning? I dont wake up and run for all the gifts, I have been given. My family and I get up at 4 in the morning and drive to cincinnati where we prepare and serve breakfast to the homeless in a church downtown. I stand there and watch these men, women and children who have no where else to go, the shelters close during christmas, and i see the joy on their faces. i see, behind troubled eyes, a will to survive. and i count my blessings. with tears in my eyes, i pray to God and thank Him for everything I have. I watch the children, who won't get anything for christmas, come in with their parents and sit in hopes of a future. My heart aches for the families. 



A few years ago, when we first began making christmas breakfast for the homeless of cincinnati, we met a man who could not have been more joyful and thankful for all that God had given him. He had no material possessions, however, this man had in his keeping that which few others in his position can boast. He was so grateful of God's mercy and he had a heart to serve anyone and everyone as Christ commands. He accepted our service but he also wanted to give something back in appreciation for our kindness. We had given out hats, gloves, scarves and socks to all who came. This man, who had formed sort of an attachment to my younger sister, approached her and gave her the socks he had previously recieved, even though he was in desperate need of them. Not knowing what else to do my sister pushed them back towards him and said ""They're too big for me, you keep them."" He handed them to her again and replied ""But I want you to have them. You'll grow into them someday."" I watched all of this and cried because I saw a man in desperate need yet, he was willing to give away all he had to bring happiness to someone else. How selfish we are on this most holy day! to care about no one and nothing but what is waiting for us under the tree."

WORDS WOMEN USE ... 

FINE 
This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up. 

FIVE MINUTES 
If she is getting dressed, this is half an hour. Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given 5 more minutes to watch the game before helping around the house. 

NOTHING 
This is the calm before the storm. This means ""something,"" and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with 'Nothing' usually end in ""Fine"". 

GO AHEAD 
This is a dare, not permission. Don't do it! 

LOUD SIGH 
This is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A ""Loud Sigh"" means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over ""Nothing"". 

THAT'S OKAY 
This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. ""That's Okay"" means that she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake. 

THANKS 
A woman is thanking you. Do not question it or faint. Just say you're welcome. 

WHATEVER 
It's a woman's way of saying F*** YOU!"

You are a virtual roller coaster of emotions, and most people enjoy the ride.
Your mood tends to set the tone of the room, and when you're happy, this is a good thing.
When you get in a dark mood, watch out - it's very hard to get you out of it.
It's sometimes hard for you to cheer up, and your gloom can be contagious.

 THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

Push your eyes for interesting light show
(Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes)
See a variety of blobs, stars and flashes. Try to make out things your subconscious is trying to send you a message? Can you control what you see by pressing different areas with different forces? Would it be possible to somehow see the same effects on TV?

See how long you can hold your breath
(Amusement Potential: 4-20 minutes)
Not that much fun, but it sure passes the time. Play with a friend, or try to beat your own personal best. Some tips: hyperventilate before hand, and stay as still as possible. My personal best is 2:00 (exactly).

Try to not think about penguins
(Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes)
This is especially hard, because by trying too much, you remember what you were trying to avoid thinking of. If you try too little, you end up thinking about penguins anyway.

Use your secret mind power
(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)
Pick a passing by and try to use your mind power to command them do something, like drop their bag or knock into someone. The law of averages dictates that sooner or later one of your mind commands will come true, so you can convince yourself that you really have super human powers and waste even more time trying them out.

Scratch yourself
(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)
Go ahead, scratch yourself now. Even if nothing itches, go ahead. Doesn't that feel pretty good?

Repeat the same word over and over until it loses its meaning
(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)
Pick a random word out of a magazine and say it aloud to yourself until it becomes a meaningless set of noises.

Hurt yourself
(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)
What is pain? Why is it unpleasant? There's nothing physical about it - it's all in your mind. Plus, after pinching yourself for awhile, boredom will seem nice next to being in pain.

Try to swallow your tongue
(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)
There's not much to say about this one. It is possible.

Pretend to be a car
(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)
Make appropriate revving noises in your head as you walk along and add a racing commentary as you pass strangers in the street. Use blinking eyes as indicators for extra authenticity. 

Look at something for awhile, shut eyes, study after image
(Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes)
Another great time waster. It takes about 30 seconds of staring to create an after image, and the image is then viewable for about the same length of time. Fun to combine this one with pushing on your eyes.

Get yourself as nauseated as possible
(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)
Best achieved by looking straight up and spinning around. Try to be so dizzy you can't even stand up. This is also entertaining due to the ""makes boredom seem a lot better"" effect (see ""Hurt Yourself""). 

 

 THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH VERY LITTLE

See what's in your neighbour's rubbish/trash
(Amusement Potential: 20-30 minutes)
You can learn a lot about people by what they throw out. You might uncover some dark secret about them. Plus, they might be throwing out something with value that still works, like a VCR or some porn mags.

Watch TV, repeat everything said in Italian accent
(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)
Sort of entertaining. Include flamboyant shoulder shrugs for added impact, or go for a Marlon Brando set of grunts. 

Send spooky emails
(Amusement Potential: 15-60 minutes)
Look up someone's CV on the web, do some research on them via Google and then send them an email full of personal references claiming to be an ex-work colleague who fell in love with their shoes. Or something.

Play our useless games
(Amusement Potential: how long have you got?)
Waste away the hours with our collection of useless games

Make prank phone calls
(Amusement Potential: 20-60 minutes)
Very entertaining, but requires discipline. Remember - vulgarities don't make a call funny, but getting the other person to believe a ridiculous story will. Try seeing if you can get them to make noises to 'test' the line. One to get you started off: Call McDonalds with weird complaints about their food.

Pretend all humans will die except for people in room with you
Amusement Potential: 10-20 minutes)
What would you do if this really happened? Would the group stay together, or would there be factions? Who would join what group? Remember, there would only be power for a few days before the plants ran out of fuel or broke. To travel, you would always have to be near cars to siphon gas out of. Best to do with people you know.

Step off a curb with eyes shut, imagine it's a cliff
(Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes)
To get any benefit out of this one, you have to have a good imagination. Don't step off immediately, build up to the jump. Study the ravine below. Feel the winds at that altitude. Step off and...AHHHHHH!!!!!

Try and sound Welsh
(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)
The key to sounding Welsh is to make sure that your voice goes up at the end of the sentence, so that everything sounds like a question. Throw in a superfluous 'isn't it?' at the end of everything you say and you're halfway there. Isn't it? 

Burn things with a magnifying glass
(Amusement Potential: 5-30 minutes)
Ants are always fun to use for this, but burning the face of someone you don't like, under some circumstances, can be just as entertaining. 

 

 THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH ANOTHER PERSON

Have a water drinking contest
(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)
While the competition is fun, you probably won't feel too good afterward. To give your event an old western theme, slam the cups upside down on the tables after you have emptied them.

Stare at the back of someone's head until they turn around
(Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes)
This works on the ""I have the feeling I'm being watched"" principle. Conduct an experiment-does this really work?

Have a ""Who is less competitive"" competition
wonder (Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)
Trying to win at this will make you lose. Trying to lose makes you win which makes you lose. Not trying at all makes you lose which makes you win which makes you lose.

Pick up a dog so it can see things from your point of view
(Amusement Potential: 3-5 minutes)
Think about it: your dog has only seen the house from a viewpoint from 6"" to 2' high (15 to 60 cm for all you metric fans). It's never seen the tops of counters, what you keep on your desk, the tops of shelves, etc. Try looking at things from its point of view, too.

Pull out a hair, stick in someone's ear
(Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes)
Best done to sleeping people. Added challenge in having no one else around, because then you can't blame it on anyone else. Try to beat your record number of times before the person catches on.

Pour water in hand, make sneeze noise, throw water on back of person's neck
(Amusement Potential: 5-15 minutes)
Always a good gag. For an even bigger reaction out of the person, act like you're not sorry at all for what they think you did. Comment instead on how big that sneeze was or about how there was a lot of mucus in that one.

"event","I woke up at 4am Thursday with an awful pain in my side. I can't even describe how painful it was (mom says its almost like giving birth). Well, I started getting sick because the pain was so bad. I called Mom and she thought it might be the flu or something. Then, my roommate called the nurse (even though the nurse that is ""On call"" gets off at midnight) and she said that it was going around and to lay still, that it would stop hurting in about two hours. The doctor didn't get in until 9am so I had to wait five hours before I could see someone about it. I eventually went to sleep and woke up at 11am. I went to the health clinic and the doctor said she wanted me to go to the emergency room because she thought I might have kidney stones. I called mom and we went to UK and waited for HOURS!!! Finally I they called me in and yes, I have kidney stones (plural), one in each kidney. They gave me pain meds and sent me on my way. Hopefully I can just pass them and don't have to go back and have them dig it out. One is embedded in my right kidney and doesn't look like it'll move which isn't a bad thing really cause mom has had one like that for 14 years. The other one (the one that woke me up and is giving me all sorts of hell) is still on its way. They said it souldn't take too long but that was thursday and this is sunday. Now, what they mean by ""too long"", i have no idea. Anyway. Enough complaining. I have work to do. I still have to finish my report. And i missed half of my german exam."

"event","I'm am very irritated!!!
 
1) My room is still freezing. They are trying to ""conserve"" energy, so they won't turn on the air. Well, my room is now colder than outside. I can't sleep at night because it's so cold.
 
2) The internet has been down for a while and I couldn't get any homework done this weekend. Not that I could anyway, because everytime I sat down to do anything my fingers would turn blue, like now. 
 
3) Natalie's clothes are EVERYWHERE!!!!! She said this morning that they were all over the floor because SHE'S stressed. Well, HER clothes on the floor are making ME stressed. I feel like I'm about to explode because I can't get anything done. It's hard for me to clean up when I cant make her mess go away too. It feels like I didn't get anything done. I can't even walk in the room without tripping over her clothes. There is a HUGE pile in front of the door. I'm embarrassed to have anyone come in. I even told Julie not to come in. She said we could room together next semester but neither of us wants to leave our hall.
 
4) AND NOW, the pipes in my closet are cracking and dripping. I had to take all the clothes out of my closet this morning before class. There is now a rather large wet spot on the carpet in my closet. I can hear drip, drip, drip all the way across the room. It's very irritating. 
 
 
I need a break. I need longer than a three day weekend. I'm counting down til Thanksgiving break. I've gotten to the point where I don't want to do ANYTHING. All I can do is sit and stare at a wall. Then I feel even worse because I didn't get anything done. And where did my sunshine go. I'm already tired of being cold, obviously, because they won't turn the air on. AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

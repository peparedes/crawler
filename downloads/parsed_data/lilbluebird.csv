life is so funny sometimes. it comes and goes so quick. i thought i wanted to do death and dying work, and i still do , but i still need a lot of training. the same patient that died coded twice today and i was there for one of them, right outside with his wife. i felt like i was going to throw up. yea i need to work on that."

Featuring: Still Feels Good Album
Songwriters: N/A
Complimentary ""Every Day"" Ringtone
You could have bowed out gracefully
But you didn't
You knew enough to know to leave well enough alone
But you wouldn't
I drive myself crazy trying to stay out of my own way
The messes that i made
But my secrets are so safe
The only one who gets me
Yeah, you get me
It's amazing to me

How every day
every day
every day
You save my life

I come around all broken down and crowded out
And you're comfort
Sometimes the place I go is so deep and dark and desperate
I don't know
I don't know

How every day
every day
every day
You save my life

Sometimes I swear I don't know if I am coming or going
But you always say something without even knowing
That I am hanging onto your words with all my might
And it's alright
Yeah I am alright
For one more night
Every day

Every day
Every day
Every Every Every day
You save me
You save me oh oh oh oh
Na na na na na na-ah
Every day
Every day



Every day
You save my life"

but this entry is to talk about how much i have changed and how much has changed in my life since i first had this journal. its really fukin amazing. look back at my entries when i was 16/17. oh jeez i was a fukin herb. but still there was some wisdom in them. and a sense of undying strength and determination to what i want and get what i want and to FEEL how i wanted. 

i think i forget that sometimes. this adult thing is hard. this love of your life thing is hard, this military gf thing is hard. i mean i have been doing that for some time, but now, that we have been together so much i dont know how i handled the past five years, and honestly it was all strength adn determination. 

i think it is important to look back at ourselves and see where you have ended up and how far you have come. 

now if i can remember all this during the upcoming weeks, months, years i will be ok."

"event","i had an interesting day.


i really just got it started at about 5 today because i was a lil iffy all morning/ afternoon. i then took the bus to the mall. i was hungry so i grabbed some suishi , it was delicious. then i did something bad. i literally made a wrong turn at tiffanys, and then made another wrong turn inside (well the first one i was really lost, the second, not so much =) , anyway after getting depressed in there i went to walmart for a few things. then i made a deal with myself, if i walked home, i was allowed to get a matcha green tea from jamba juice ( my new fav drink as of yesterday lol). so i got one and started to walk home. and then i came to a store which had something i needed. long story short  i was carrying literally TEN POUNDS worth of stuff ( dont worry you will know what it all was on Friday). so then i started to get hot, and sweaty and cranky. then i was like fuk walking i am taking the bus . all i had was one single and a 20 so it was a no go for the bus.


i tried to get on the bus by the hilton. so when i realized that wasnt going to happen i continued pissed on my way. i came across a sicilian place we should try , and a million annoying tourists, but i wanted to stay on the strip bc i felt safer. some hawaiians were singing some songs for a group of people  along the way , stopped listened to that and rested and then continued on my way. by this point i am starting to feel sorry for myself, i am cursing you out in my head , and i am mad that i dont drive or at least have a moped lol. and then it happened.............



i saw a bunch of people congregated on the beach by the police station. now , another person may have kept walking, but no,  not i,  liz grillo. i know a group near water just staring at it,  means one thing and one thing only......... FIREWORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

so i stood there for about 10 minutes and they started at 8:45 exactly. it was friggin AWESOME and made me feel so much better. it was right there on waikiki beach i stopped feeling miserable enjoyed the hawaiian breeze and an amazing fireworks show !!!!"

"event","so being by myself in hawaii while tom is out to see for the week has been the hardest thing of life. not even kidding. it sucks living by yourself. during the day i dont really care , i enjoy being alone, but at night it is so lonely and depressing. 

toms friends gf is out here too, we have been hanging out and she is awesome . its nice to have someone who knows excatly how shitty all of this can be. her bf also has a diff job then tom so he is allowed to call and such and i have been getting updates that way as well. 

this was/is a real wake up call as to what life with tom being in the navy is going to be like. we spoke about it and it is clear i will be "" a navy wife"", but this aspect of it, being alone without friends, or family near is going to be the hardest adjustment. 


but i am so happy when i am with him. we have so much fun just doing nothing. i feel amazing. i need to keep saying this to myself to remind me its worth it. and i know it is bc when i see him on friday i am going to freakin bawl like a baby. 

ugh love. its freakin insane"

on the other hand.... i was by myself for the morning and was walking around the neighborhood and being on my own is a lot harder than i thought it would be. i felt totally out of my element and over my head. but then when i end up spending time with tom, i am reminded that the hard stuff is worth it . lets just hope i feel this way when he is gone for a long amount of time."

""There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are messengers of overwhelming grief...and unspeakable love.""

i used to think that tears were a sign of weakness, in a person, and part of me still believes that. but every day that passes by i know that i am a strong person. not just for me, but for my friends, family, and my other half. the tears i may cry from time to time are just sadness and pain, or joy and happiness. but nonetheless, it's not weakness. i've come a long way, and i understand now that if we don't allow ourselves to shed a few tears we will drown inside.

we are strong. don't let our tears fool you. what is distance but merely an obstacle that time will allow us to overcome? ladies (and gents), we are we can get through the time that we are separated from our loved ones. we'll stand by our men (and women), with unbreakable faith, that soon we will be reunited with them."

a) i love my internship. everyday is terrifying, but in the end its all worth it. who knew i would love an environment of recovering heroin addicts. 

b) a death of a friends uncle made me re-live the feelings of losing my dad---- it really fkin sucked. 

c) oz came to visit. he has known tom since pensacola days . shwoed him around the city. made me want to work with veterans more adn more then words can say. he just came back from iraq and afghanistan . the things he told me , i could never forget, so i can only imagine how he feels.

working with veterans doesnt even seem like an option anymnore, its so much more like a necessity. 

d) him. that freakin sailor. i love him, i hate him, i love him. but at least he is home and we can talk and handle it all together. even if we are freaks , we are freaks together.

e) NYU. 

f) losing weight feels awesome. i love it. i am gonna love it even more when i see the look on tom' s face and then have crazy body rockin lol. 

g) the stress of living home is KILLING me. 

h) but i love being around my family most of the time, so it makes it worthwhile SOMETIMES."

"event","A POEM ABOUT OUR GIRLFRIENDS    
Someone will always be prettier. 
Some will always be smarter. 
Some of their houses will be bigger. 
Some will drive a better car. 
Their children will do better in school. 
And their husband will fix more things around the house. 
So let it go, 
and love you and your circumstances. 
Think about it! 
The prettiest woman in the world can have hell in her heart. 
And the most highly favored 
woman on your job may be unable to have children. 
And the richest woman you know, 
she's got the car, the house, the clothes~~~~ 
might be lonely. 
And the word says, 'If I have not Love, I am nothing.' 
So, again, love you. 
Love who you are. 
Look in the mirror in the morning and smile and say, 
'I am too blessed to be stressed and too anointed, to be disappointed!' 
'Winners make things happen~~ 
Losers let things happen.'"

i was just looking at commencement pics online and it made it a little bit more real , but still not fully. not even as i gave my keys in for my dorm did it seem real. 


or maybe i just dont want it to be real. i am so dramatic lol 


anyway i had the best time of my life last night. some ppl just sat around and were fukin boring but the others were awesome. it was such a great night and it felt so good to just wild out,. 


look i even make my icon pic one from soph year. i make myself sick lol 

spoke to tom again this am ... i love it. i really really wish he was here with me. 

and i found out today my dad's brother my uncle is coming to my grad party from florida so i am excited and my cousins, but i still dont believe any of it lol 

i just hope everything goes smoothly tomorrow !"

"event","its friday and i graduate on monday. i feel like i should write a deep meaningful entry as i sit here by myself in my empty dorm room. and honestly i have nothing to give. nothing to say. maybe its because i am in complete shock , or maybe its because i am terrified or maybe its because the huge change which is about to take place makes me sick to my stomach. 

i am so proud of myself, and yet i think i still should have tried harder. harder for what i dunno, but harder. this is the one thing, no one can take away from me , i worked my ass for it and its mine. 


and i still feel so detached from the fact that i am leaving . honestly i really think it is complete denial. its too real. too close to being an adult . too much change all at once. last week i could have told you the hours till graduation, and now i kinda want just a few more. i want just a few more nights in my dorm, a few more orders of chinese food, a few more trips to post at 12:30 am and a few more all nighters in the library. but i guess thats how it is. i was/am so exited to leave and go to NYU i guess i overlooked how much i love my little room, on my little campus and everything which goes with it. 

i try to think back to how i felt when i was graduating h.s. ..... such a different feeling. such a different person i was. i feel like there are so much to say and not nearly enough words to say all the feelings i have. and i am having a hard time saying goodbye to people. so if you know me please dont try .... i dont even think i can seriously handle it on any level. 


the sad part of almost a lot of things is that i am happy i am leaving bc i am leaving quack behind. he really is no good for me , nothing but heartache and trouble which is not even worth writing about here but i still do. at least now i know he is an ass to every girl not just me. 


tom called me today from Brunei and then we got disconnected after 2 mins and 7 sec. and he didnt call back , so there was probably a million people waiting since the ships email has been down and no one has really had contact. i miss him. i need him here. i know it sounds hypocritical after that whole quack paragraph... but everything with quack has taught me so much about myself and everything with tom, and thats why i need tom here or i need to be where he is. 


sigh.... i think thats all i got for now."

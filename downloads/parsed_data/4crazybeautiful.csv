"event","This is for you;

Tell me I`m Beautiful;
Then, curse at me.
Tell me you love me; 
you just want to fuck me.
You want to control me;
and I put up a fight.
You always won, but I
tried my best, I guess.
You say ""It`s all for my own good;""
but you don`t mean that.
What you meant to say was;
it`s going to be this way, 
just because you think it should be.
You say you love;
but you contradict yourself.
You left me, more than once;
I held tight, didn`t let you go.
You had me under your spell, 
wrapped around your finger, &
you knew it all too well.
I finally won though;
I left you, crying;
And now; you miss me,
but I won`t allow you to hold on.
Tell me all my failures;
I know you will."

"event","<P>My eating disorder is spinning out of control.&nbsp; I hadn`t ate since Tuesday night, so I ate breakfast today.. I came home from school, and was so glad &amp; happy that I`d been doing well, so I decided to fix myself a sandwich &amp; have some chips.&nbsp; I hadn`t even finished the sandwich &amp; I started feeling like shit for eating it.&nbsp; So, I ran to the back porch and puked everything up.&nbsp; I don`t know how I`ve gotten this way.&nbsp; It`s all I think about.&nbsp; Do I look fat right now?&nbsp; You can`t eat that.&nbsp; And these things just recite over and over in my head.</P>
<P>I`ve been actually concentrating on school.&nbsp; Even in Chemistry, Coach actually came back to our table today &amp; was like ""WHOA"" because we never do anything, we always talk.&nbsp; I`ve realized that school is the only thing I need to focus on, nothing else will matter after May 2007.&nbsp; So, therefore, the petty shit is over.</P>
<P>Yet, I have been dwelling on something.&nbsp; Something that I believe I have every right to dwell on, I`ve even dreamed about it.&nbsp; As most of you know, I pretty much lost my best friend.&nbsp; I don`t know how or why.&nbsp; She just totally quit talking to me..&nbsp; I`m thinking that some people are telling her shit about me and she`s believing.&nbsp; Because this isn`t like her, we`ve been friends for four years and nothing has ever come between us.&nbsp; She seems like a totally different person, and I just miss my old JD.&nbsp; (Yes, she did start dating Ashton, but to me, that has nothing to do with it.&nbsp; Unless he`s the reason she quit talking to me.)&nbsp; I`m actually glad Ashton &amp; her got together.&nbsp; I think they make a good couple, and this gives him a chance to let me go.&nbsp; During the summer, I was always scared to talk to him because everytime we would even begin to have a normal conversation, he would change it all around to how he misses me &amp; wished we could have had a child together (pregnancy scare)&nbsp; because a baby might have changed everything, and he would end up crying &amp; leaving.&nbsp; That`s no way to live, I know that as well as anyone.&nbsp;I just don`t understand why I had to lose the only person I trusted.</P>
<P>So, I woke up this morning &amp; wanted to call her and talk to her &amp; work everything out, but I couldn`t remember the first 3 digits of her number, so I didn`t.&nbsp; Then, at school, I realized that she just doesn`t need me anymore, and I guess I don`t need her.&nbsp; So, I finally got over it today.&nbsp; <STRONG>Things change, people change, but life goes on.</STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I`m trying to get out of athletics.&nbsp; I want to go to Ag.&nbsp; Athletics is boring &amp; most of them are rich &amp; quite snobby.&nbsp; Yes, it`s nice to have girl talks sometimes, but when all you ever have to talk about it your new purse or outfit &amp; all the latest juicy gossip, &amp; your next cheer competition, something is seriously wrong.&nbsp; It must be nice to have a life like that, but you are so damn boring!</P>
<P>Justin`s taking me to the mall &amp; to a movie tomorrow night.&nbsp; We`ve been dating almost a year &amp; we`ve never been to the movies, haha.</P>

"event","<P><STRONG><U>20O4</U>; in review</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Ashton, Ashton, Ashton.&nbsp; January-April, some of the worst times of my life.&nbsp; Fighting, cheating, breaking up; hell, I don`t ever know why we stayed together as long as we did.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Cutting.&nbsp; I can`t say that I wish I hadn`t, because I`m afraid if I wouldn`t have cut, I would have killed myself.&nbsp; This was also in January-April, go figure.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I started hanging out with Erik &amp; ""Enterprise"" as everyone knew him.&nbsp; I was immediately attracted to him, but wouldn`t let myself fall for him, all the while, he was falling for me too.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I went fishing with Erik &amp; Enterprise a lot.&nbsp; Enterprise taught me how to use an open mouth reel &amp; we walked around the pond together.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>April, we had been fishing at the pond, then later went to the lake.&nbsp; I wanted to kiss him so badly, but I was still with Ashton.&nbsp;&nbsp; He built a fire &amp; we were just all hanging out, sitting/ laying in the back of the truck &amp; he kisses me.&nbsp; It was not a good kiss, but I didn`t mind.&nbsp; I knew what I wanted.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I left Ashton for Enterprise.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Erik and I went birthday shopping for Enterprise &amp; started drinking PGA.&nbsp; I got drunk off my ass.&nbsp; It was so much fun!</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I was so happy with Enterprise, god he made me smile &amp; laugh, and I just really liked him, but Ashton knew how to get to me.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I went back to Ashton.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>He cried 24/7 because I wasn`t the same person &amp; I had moved on.&nbsp; </STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I broke up with him for the last time, the Sunday before school let out for summer.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I took Ryan to my softball banquet with me.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>School let out, &amp; Enterprise spoke to me.&nbsp; I thought he was mad at me, but he wasn`t.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>The day school let out, all of us went muddin` &amp; rode with Enterprise.&nbsp; We had so much fun.&nbsp; That night, we partied at the pond,&nbsp;Enterprise started drinking &amp; he eventually kissed me.&nbsp; I liked it, a lot, but didn`t want a relationship.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Tiff &amp; I went to Lake Winnie &amp; had some fun, haha.&nbsp; It was cool.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Enterprise&nbsp;&amp; I would&nbsp;kiss, but I was scared to fall for him completely.&nbsp; He would ask me why I would kiss if I didn`t want to date him, &amp; I did want to date him, but I was scared.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>One day, we were fishing at lake &amp; he was standing there with his reel &amp; everything, I kissed him &amp; we started making out..&nbsp; Before I realized what was happening, he picked me up, my legs were around him, &amp; he was taking to the jeep.&nbsp; This was nothing like me, what the hell was I doing.&nbsp; After we had sex, I gave in &amp; was like, well, I guess I might as well date him now, right.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I was supposed to be at Tiff`s one night, but instead,&nbsp;Enterprise &amp; I went to the pond &amp; spent the night there.&nbsp; That was the most amazing sex, from like 11 p.m. to 12 p.m. take a break, wash my car from where we almost got stuck, &amp; come back &amp; have sex until 4:30 a.m.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I started smoking sometime in here.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Enterprise, because Justin, to me.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I meet Justin`s family &amp; get along with everyone.&nbsp; </STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Justin &amp; I go to the races a lot.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Erik started acting like a little bitch.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I went with Justin &amp; his family to Six Flags &amp; White Water.&nbsp; It was my first time to go to both of those places &amp; I loved him.&nbsp; We had so much fun.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I finally get to meet Deena, Justin`s mom.&nbsp; I absolutely love her.&nbsp; I was so scared to meet her because of Mrs. Bitch, but I did &amp; I realized that most people don`t act like Katrina.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>My dad tells me I look trashy because I hang with all guys.&nbsp; So, I get pissed, get drunk, &amp; drive to Hippy Hole..&nbsp; Park, unpark, TRY to park again, hit a car.&nbsp; Walk down to the Hippy Hole &amp; tell the guys ""<EM>I think I hit a car, but I`m not sure.""</EM> &amp; Everyone`s like ""damn, you smell like alcohol!""&nbsp; Yeah, I was so fucking scared to go home.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I get grounded the next day for driving somewhere I wasn`t supposed to.&nbsp; There goes my car for three weeks.&nbsp; At least they didn`t find out I was drunk..</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Justin &amp; I spend the night at Chad &amp; Alex`s, when I`m supposed to be at Tiff`s.&nbsp; I get so fucking drunk &amp; puke on him.&nbsp; Straight alcohol and then everything goes blurry.&nbsp; He took me into Chad`s room &amp; changed me, then he got me to drink some water.&nbsp; I never drink without him, because I know he will always take care of me.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>We go to a party &amp; on the way home we get lost.&nbsp; We end up in like, Marshall County, find our way back, go to Chad &amp; Alex`s, had a few beers &amp; went home.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>School starts again, I`m dreading it, I`m taking pills, I`m out of control.&nbsp; I go the first day.&nbsp; I skip the second day.&nbsp; I didn`t go the third day because I was so upset that I wrecked my car again.&nbsp; I can`t drive when I`m upset &amp; I was more upset that I had been in a long time.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I cut for the last time.&nbsp; After that, I threw my razor blades away.&nbsp; </STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>School gets better, I get caught skipping quite a few times, but pretty much get off the hook.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Justin &amp; I have our first breakdown in October.&nbsp; &amp; I can fortunately say that it wasn`t over something stupid.&nbsp; It was over something that really mattered.&nbsp; That was our first &amp; only fight, so far.&nbsp; *knocks on wood*&nbsp; I cry, I`m wondering why I did this to myself again.. I`m all to pieces, but I didn`t cut.&nbsp; We work it out, with some time..</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Justin moves in in November.&nbsp; That was a big step, but everyone was sure of it.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>We go to Enterprise to spend Thanksgiving weekend down there.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I have some alcohol &amp; am having a great time, when he disappears &amp; I realize him &amp; his mom are having a talk.&nbsp; I end up drinking all of my beer &amp; his too because I`m scared the he`s moving back to Enterprise.&nbsp; After their two hour long talk, he tells me that his mom can`t make him move back &amp; that that wasn`t even what it was about.&nbsp; I was still crying &amp; had gone to bed by myself by this time.&nbsp; We have amazing sex, and I feel safe again.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I try to quit smoking, but can`t.&nbsp; </STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Alix spends the night with us.&nbsp; We go to the Huntsville mall &amp; get lost on the way there &amp; on the way home.</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>We spend Christmas together &amp; have amazing times.</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>I have to say 20O4 was the best year I`ve ever had.&nbsp; I can`t explain it, but I wish you all the best year.&nbsp; &lt;3</P>"

<P><STRONG><U>CHiSTMAS;</U></STRONG>&nbsp; This will be the <STRONG>best</STRONG> Christmas ever.&nbsp; I have the best family in the world.&nbsp; Justin`s side of the family is nothing less than absolutely amazing.&nbsp; &amp; Of course my family, I love each and every one of them.&nbsp; I`m going to see my Pawpaw for the first time in almost a year.&nbsp; I just love hanging out with everyone, &amp; of course, you can`t forget the food!&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG><U>JUSTiN;</U></STRONG>&nbsp; As most of you know, he lives here.&nbsp; It`s the best feeling, waking up beside him every morning, and staying with him all day.&nbsp; He`s at work right now.&nbsp; For the first time, I know what it feels like to have someone treat me like I should be treated.&nbsp; He never puts me down, and he doesn`t make me cry.&nbsp; He doesn`t find all my fault &amp; throw them in my face; he loves everything about me.&nbsp; And I love everything about him.</P>
<P><STRONG><U>CHRiSTMAS PARTY;</U></STRONG>&nbsp; Justin`s Christmas party for his work was Monday.&nbsp; So much fun.&nbsp; We had pizza &amp; afterwards, a lot of us went back to Chad &amp; Alex`s.&nbsp; Justin, Chad, &amp; I went on a beer run to Scottsboro.&nbsp; (I`m ready for Fort Payne to start selling alcohol!)&nbsp; We came back &amp; a lot of people were smoking weed.&nbsp; It was funny, but annoying.&nbsp; I don`t like being around that shit.&nbsp; I started drinking (Justin didn`t drink `til we came home; he drove.)&nbsp; Justin took my outside when they started rolling another blunt `cause he didn`t want me around it.&nbsp; So, we sat in the truck until they were finished.&nbsp; I drank three &amp; snuck the rest in the house.&nbsp; We went up to his room &amp; drank some more &amp; I passed out..&nbsp; Drunken sex is usually great, but I didn`t get any, haha.&nbsp; Anyways, so that was a lot of fun.</P>
<P>&amp; Maybe I`ll be back sometime soon.&nbsp; &lt;3 y`all.</P>"

<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>Anyways, school has been alright.&nbsp; Everyone in my family is sick (including Justin)&nbsp; We`ve all got a cold &amp; cough non stop.&nbsp; It`s very annoying.&nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>Justin &amp; I are getting up &amp; going to trade-day in the morning.&nbsp; It`ll be cold, but we like to go there.&nbsp; I`m gonna try to get some more shopping done.&nbsp; We`ve got some of my parent`s &amp; we have his mom`s, but we like his cousins &amp; siblings.&nbsp; There like 3468932 of them.&nbsp; And, I still like everyone in my family.&nbsp; Christmas is so soon<STRONG><EM>!!</EM></STRONG></FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>So, today is <STRONG>day one</STRONG> of my fast.&nbsp; I`m cleansing my body, no food.&nbsp; I`ve had two cups of coffee in the past 24 hours, no food.&nbsp; I wanted to pig out all day, until I chugged the coffee.&nbsp; &amp; It feels great, really.&nbsp; Coffee keeps me going &amp; it makes me feel full.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; I`m going to go until at least Thursday.&nbsp; I wish I could go until Friday night, but Justin had Thursday off &amp; I know he`ll flip out if I don`t eat, `cause we <U>always</U> eat together.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>And, I`ve only had 5 cigarettes today, which is weird.&nbsp; You`d think since I`m not eating, I`d be smoking like a feight train, but it seems to be the complete opposite.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>I want a ring for Christmas.&nbsp; I`m not saying I want him to propose; I just want a ring.&nbsp; He asked me the other night if I wanted to go look at the necklaces &amp; rings, &amp; I was just like.. no.&nbsp; Because, I don`t want him to think he has to do something like that, yanno?&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>It can`t be any worse than last Christmas.&nbsp; I was <STRONG>really</STRONG> disappointed with Ashton.&nbsp; I could tell he didn`t put a minutes thought into what he got me.&nbsp; What kept me with him for so long?&nbsp; I don`t have a clue.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>Buut, yeah, I know what I`m getting Justin.&nbsp; I`ve already got him speakers for his truck &amp; some clothes, a John Deere tractor ( he`s in love with JD, if you didn`t know) and I know I`m gonna get him some new Timberland boots &amp; some AE shirts. Mom &amp; Dad will give him something, probably the boots.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>I have no clue what to get his family.&nbsp; I never do.&nbsp; Buut, I know they don`t expect much &amp; that makes me feel so much better.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>Hopefully, I`m going to get to go with him down to Enterprise to see his mom on Thanksgiving.&nbsp; As of now, my dad is still saying no, but I think I can talk him into it.&nbsp; =) I really hope so, `cause I wanna see where my boyfriend lived for 5 years, yanno?&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>Okay, just a lot of random shit there.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>I wonder is Jenn bad mouths me with Ashton`s family.&nbsp; I wish I could say that I just know she doesn`t, but I`m sure she does.&nbsp; Why do girls let a guy come between them.&nbsp; I mean, she was my best friend for 4 years, &amp; she couldn`t even tell me she was dating my ex.&nbsp; Hmm, that`s very hypocritical of her, because I`ve sat &amp; listened to her whine about Brooke, because Brooke does that to her.&nbsp; Honestly, I don`t give a shit that she`s dating Ashton.&nbsp; I`m actually VERY glad, because he isn`t crying to me all the damn time anymore (could be because I blocked &amp; deleted him)&nbsp; but either way, I`m just glad I have no contact with him.&nbsp; And when I see him, I just feel like laughing, because he`s such an ass &amp; I`m doing so much better.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>Not to mention, he`s extremely ugly.&nbsp; Why didn`t anyone ever inform me of that?&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>Yep, Justin`s at work.&nbsp; Waiting, waiting for him to get home &amp; call me!&nbsp; He has Thursday &amp; Saturday off.&nbsp; He also had yesterday off.&nbsp; We stayed at his house all day/ evening.&nbsp; He cooked dinner &amp; we/ they played darts.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; Always is.&nbsp; He`s simply the best guy ever.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>My daddy said if I get rid of Justin, he`s gonna kick me out &amp; have Justin move in.&nbsp; *l0l*&nbsp; &amp; When we are leaving, instead of saying ""I love you"" to me; they say ""I love y`all.""&nbsp; They`ve never loved one of my boyfriends like they do him.&nbsp; It`s adorable.&nbsp; His family does the same thing &amp; I think it`s so cute.&nbsp; =)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>Yep, life is amazing &amp; I am so very thankful for that.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>&amp; Yes, I do thank God.&nbsp; I don`t go to church, I usually don`t pray, I`m not very religious, but I do know that God exists.&nbsp; I`m just not going to be a hypocritical Christian &amp; say one thing, do the other.&nbsp; A lot of my friends, go to church &amp; think they can do wrong every day, because they go to church &amp; their sins are washed from them.&nbsp; I don`t think it works that way.&nbsp; Yanno?&nbsp; Yes, I`m sure God forgives, but there has to be a limit to his wonderful forgiveness.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>I`m in a wonderful mood, which is weird, being as how you`d think I`d be half dead from lack of food.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>Well, I`m going to get going.&nbsp; Love y`all.</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1><STRONG>Today</STRONG>;&nbsp; I got up &amp; got to his house around ten-ish.&nbsp; He was already up &amp; about to cook.&nbsp; He said ""Aw, I wanted to have breakfast ready when you got here.""&nbsp; I was like <STRONG>AWW</STRONG>, yanno?&nbsp; So, I just laid in his bed for a while, then ended up watching TV in the living room, like always, &amp; chillin`.&nbsp; I was eating while he was cooking.&nbsp; As soon as he would get something finished, I would ""taste test"" it, yanno?&nbsp; His little attitude about that was cute.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; After we ate, we watched the new <STRONG>Garfield</STRONG> movie, which was cute.&nbsp; &amp; We made love <EM>again</EM> and then ended up having some sex too.&nbsp; Very nice.&nbsp; Then, we went outside `cause set up a trap to catch whatever is killing his chickens..&nbsp; We played with the new chickens, his uncle got `em today.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; When he left for work, I was on my way home, &amp; I met my parents.&nbsp; Mom called me on my cell &amp; told me they were going to eat at Katy`s, so I just met them there.&nbsp; I saw him right when I got there, but I didn`t get to tell him bye.&nbsp; The food was super good, as always.&nbsp; On the way home, I rode with him &amp; let Daddy take my car `cause we wanted to stop at the junk store.&nbsp; I got some of the <STRONG>CUTEST</STRONG> stuff you`ve ever saw.&nbsp; But, you`ll have to wait for pictures `cause I don`t feel like it now.&nbsp; Now, I`m just chillin.</FONT></P>

I`m back, babes!  =)  I need a layout, very badly.  So, if you`re willing to help me, just comment & let me know.  I`m willing to give someone my password & let them do it for me `cause I`m totally clueless.

Anyways, I`m grounded, like whoa.  Hah, but I`m slighty getting out of it.  I should be with Justin right now, but I`m not allowed.  So, earlier I went to the lake to walk & he went with me.  Other than that though,  it`ll probably be all I see of him, other than at school, and right after.  He has Friday off too & I`m fucking grounded. Sucks.

Mmm, got a new vehicle.  '03 Avalanche & it`s MINE in April, yeah baby.  Oh my, it`s totally gorgeous.  Justin says I`m ""hot"" while driving it.  =)  Oh & I got this amazing new Victoria Secret bra.  It`s the ""B0DY"" one & it so works.  If you`re willing to pay $40 for it, I`d definely say it`s W0RTH every penny of it!  And, I got some new black boots, that come up high.  VERY cute & sexy.  I got a new blazer too.  It`s brown & gorgeous.  You can wear it with a cute shirt & jeans & it`s adorable.  Mmm, got a short for Breast Cancer awareness, because I almost lost my Gangan to it, 6-7 years ago.  She`s a strong woman, she just doesn`t see it.

Depression?  Psh, no way.  I`m over it.  I mean, if I ever get down, I do get VERY down, but that is close to NEVER.  It`s happened once in the past six months.  I know I`m strong, sometimes, you just need someone to help you see that.  Someone who doesn`t make a big deal about it & just lets you live. 

 Justin, y`all would fall in love if you met him.  He`s an amazing guy, y`all.  He`s so adorable & so sweet.  We go out & have fun.  He`s the most hilarious person I`ve ever met.  He works 4-5 days a week, so we spend EVERY moment possible together.  We`ll wake up & go to the other`s house, just to go back to bed with them.  He`s the BEST cook ever & he cleans.  Hah, that IS hott!  =)  I absolutely adore this boy & will not let him go.

Life is wonderful."

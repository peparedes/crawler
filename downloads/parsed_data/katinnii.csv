"event","hewwo-i dont feel as cheery as usual today..i feel like the glass is half empty..maybe its cuz my other half is 6 hours away..but who knos. im sittin here watchin the eagles-hello could they try a lil harder..ill spell it out for em..be aggressive b-e aggressive..b-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e! lol..thats one good thing about cheering..u learn how to spell, i kno how to spell aggressive..and without cheering taking behavorial science would be a mess, cuz i wouldnt kno how to spell psychology. 

last night kris came over. it was good times. we watched some movies and kris was introduced to chinese food. which was exciting. we made some cookies..which were tasty..but i prolly shudnt have eaten them considering im allergic haha. anyway we chatted while we watched ""my best friend's wedding"" but of course we watched the classic music scenes..we had some nice convo..then we watched ""freaky friday"" which was way better then i thot it wud be. i super liked the movie! we went to bed and in the morning watched ""bring it on"" and of course that was fun!

after kris left i entered a day of hell..aka..cleaning my room, doing laundry, and basically doing whatever my mom says..my escape from this day was eating a meatball sandwich. and now m bak to the annoyingness watching this eagles game where their not impressing me at all. they better shape up. lol

welp im outtie..i gotta go yell at the tv, and pretend im doing homework so i dont hafta clean some more..mwah!"

"event","so heres my thought..to everyone who has someone and u actually live somewhat near  to eachother..u are truly lucky. when u hug them..dont let go till the other one lets go first. its awesome having someone to love and share things with. but having to be away from them, and in my case 6 hours away from them.. u feel like ur missing a part of urself until they come back. so heres my advice..if u have a boyfriend or a girlfriend here..be with them as much as u can..cuz its miserable having to spend months apart. and thats my thought of the day. anywho...

last night my mommy wouldnt let me out..cuz i didnt go to school..and i need to rest..yada yada yada..so my dad picked me up..thank god cuz i couldnt wait to get out of the house! lol..me n my mom had been arguing about cheerleadin..u kno..the typical ""rah-rah wont get u anywhere katina.."" i hate those talks...such a pain in the butt! so i went out to eat with my dad n stepmom..i had a big greasy meatball sandwich..dont ask me why..its not my normal diner food-but u gota go with a change every now and then i guess. then i went to my dads and squishy came over. we watched the grinch lol..i was upset that i hadnt watched the whole cartoon version of the grinch before christmas like usual..so we made up for that..then we watched a kinights tale. we pretty much just layed there and talked..we got into an arguement about what age to have kids at haha..that was interesting. and then we actually had to pay attention to the part in a knights tale when they have the dancing scene. its so hot! i love that part..i love the music and the dance..so i had to watch that and dance around a lil. and i told squishy he shud grow his hair out like heath ledger lol..i like the way hhis hair bobs around in that scene. then we flipped thro and watchd some movie about love potions and monkeys...it was fun! lol

this morning my daddy woke me up at 845..cuz squishy came over at 9..we just chatted..layed around a lil..and watched the crocidile hunter..yeh so then it was time for r goodbye..of course i had the usual tears..but squish wiped em away for me. and then he left..and thats the last time ill c him..until 33 days from now. yep its a countdown. i then called laura..she made me feel better..i had some oreos and milk..some nice comfort food. and then talked to j-bean about the welcome back saquib party..which im super sad i missed..hopefully he'll come back again on april fool's day. 

now its time for my summary of this entry / my final thought :
spend as much time u can with ur b/f and g/f..take advantage of having them close to u..but do me a favor and dont tell me how happy u guys r..lol no need to rub ur togetherness in my face..but do have fun!

buh byez!"

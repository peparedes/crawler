Lots of pictures of things I've done to/with my hair.

Let's start with a look at what my hair used to look like: virgin hair! 
7th grade I think? Around then.

Oo! This is a good question! One that I have a little bit to rant about. :D
I hate the idea of being chemically preserved, put in a coffin, then the coffin being put into a burial vault (made of cement, plastic, or metal), and then being buried in the ground! IT COMPLETELY CONTRADICTS THE POINT OF BEING PUT IN THE GROUND. Put bodies in a damn decomposable bag or something, THEN put them in the ground. No coffin. No vault. Let it & your body decompose and be able to return to the earth like it's supposed to. We've turned it into something horribly unnatural.

Personally, I'd like to be cremated if the above method is not allowed. Maybe have a few morsels of myself be saved from cremation for my loved ones to cook and eat. You grok?

Have my cremated remains used in a garden somewhere.

Man, cemeteries are SUCH a waste of space! Especially since they aren't doing any good by not letting the bodies return to the earth. Fucking christ, man. I don't understand the idea of visiting a dead perosn's tomb. THEY ARE DEAD. THEY ARE NOT THERE AT THE GRAVESITE. Only their bodily remains are. You could remember and talk to a dead person just the same at home or in your car as you could while staring at their headstone. You really feel you need to visit the final resting spot of their earthly remains? You're really that attached to a bunch of decomposing flesh? I bet if you could see what the body looked like while you visited that headstone, you'd run away screaming and never come back. 

I'm really not trying to be insensitive here, a loved one dying is a very rough loss. But to carry on and visit the gravesite and shit... They don't THINK about what they're doing. It drive me nuts."

If your sexual identity is ""bisexual,"" why would you have to change it!? :D

But if any of the females below wanted me to go strictly girl, they could have me in a heartbeat.
There are pics behind the cut. A couple are nude, but with no naughty bits showing.

<i>In</i> the ocean.

I'm totally for space exploration and travel, I love it, but considering how much unexplored ""land"" we have here on earth I really feel we should be concentrating on that instead! Approx. 71% of the earth is covered with ocean -- if we could only develop the (safe) technologies to build cities underwater... Consider the possibilities! It would be fantastic! It would be great practice for building human habitats on other planets as well. It could solve over-crowding issues here on earth. It would teach us so much as well because most of the oceans are vastly unexplored. We're finding new species all the time, finding creatures alive that we thought to be extinct for millions of years. 

Antarctica would be a good place to start exploring more, too. It's 5.4 million square miles! And at multiple points in earth's history, it was lush and green and tropical. Imagine the fossils we could find there if only we could fully explore it! The things we could learn! Building habitats there would also be great practice for exploring icy planets or moons.

Let's explore and ""conquer"" earth before we go exploring/conquering space. There is so much here left to learn and discover.. No wonder no intellignt life from elsewhere in the universe hasn't contacted us yet. They probably look at us and laugh. I do."

Hmm now.. The first concert I fully remember: Counting Crows. In Lansing, MI. I was in 7th or 8th grade... That was legendary to me simply because it was my first. [And because I loved Counting Crows! I think that only <i>August and Everything After</i> and <i>Recovering the Satellites</i> were out at that time.. I haven't followed them much since, except for ""Colorblind"" off the <i>Cruel Intentions</i> soundtrack.. love that fucking song])

But Skillet has definitely had the most hard-rocking awesome concerts I've ever been too. Look past the preachy-Christian-Jesusness of their concerts (unless you like that, which is cool with me) and they have a fucking AMAZING show! Rock your face right off.

Tool was pretty awesome too. Their concert made me feel like I was on acid, or what I imagine acid to be like, I suppose.

Atomship was way fucking badass too, opening up for Sevendust. I really enjoy(ed) Atomship.

Those are all big-time bands, though. <a href=""http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=136519569"">theillalogicalspoon</a> has definitely been my favorite home-town concert experience. And not just because I played bass for them at one time. Seeing them in concert is as amazing as being in the band!


I've never seen Ani Difranco in concert, but if I did I'd probably say that would be a legendary experience for me."

Zombies?
What kind of zombies? The slow-moving kind, or the superhumanly quick kind? My disaster plan for the slow-moving kind is a chainsaw and a flamethrower and a big fence around my house. The superhumanly quick kind... well now, I might just join them and try to take over the world. And star in many many movies.
Actually, I'd probablly rush out and buy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Zombie-Survival-Guide-Complete-Protection/dp/1400049628/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1228326618&sr=1-1"">The Zombie Survival Guide</a> and cower under a blanket reading it with a flashlight, jumping at every noise.

As far as earthquakes and hurricanes... well I suppose house insurance would be good, but seeing as that I don't own a house... I have nothing to worry about at the moment. Living out of a hotel room has its advantages I suppose :P

But what about plagues? Air-bourne viruses and/or diseases that are sure to wipe out 90% of Earth's population?!!

THAT WOULD BE FRIGGIN AWESOME."

I think I'll be posting on here again. Re-acquaint myself with LJ. Been 2 years..

Aaron and I are in Texarkana for a few months. March, at least. More likely until June.
So nice to be out of Michigan for the winter!! Haha. Fuck the cold.

I just started a job at Michaels (arts & crafts store) part-time. Can't wait until I get paid... as of right now, I'm being supported by Aaron. I'll feel better when I can contribute.

Texarkana is pretty neat... I'm developing a bit of a Texas accent. There's a pool hall down the road a bit, and a nightclub that's open til 3 am that we go to a couple times a week. And there's 3 sushi restaurants here!! Get my sushi fix every week. Loves it.

Hey, I graduated from Jackson Community College in July.. got an Associate Degree in Science. 
Can't really do shit with it though, except go on to a 4-year university and get a bachelor's... Not sure what I want to major in. I wanted to get a degree in physics (astrophysics or quantum physics), but I've become extremely interested in Assyriology lately, so I've been considering that.

I've started sewing. Have the sewing machine in the hotel room with me. The idea was to do t-shirt surgery/reconstruction/etc and sell em online for a source of income... but ya need money to make money, yeah? I need to buy some blank t-shirts/tank tops first before I can do anything to them.

No new tattoos. Haven't had the money."

"event","Our idols and demons will pursue us until we learn to let them go. Habits will never break if you keep mending them. So here it is out and open: hoping to never be where I have been before. I went to Az this week, saw some friends and family. I had a draining day, my dad, well its better than it has been, we were able to sit in the same room for about 15 minutes this time before he just starts in and runs into another room. He is just so pist and hurt by me, I am not happy the way he wants me to be. I didnt turn out the way he had hoped. Daddy's girl growing up. Someday we'll be able to have a conversation again, I dream of that. Saw Curtis, he just got out for things WE did. He looked so good, the way he did our sophmore year, before the drugs. His face wasn't sunk in, he had some meat on his bones, like e could actually eat something. Talking to him makes me never want to think of those things again. Like he says though, ""it will be in my head everyday, but each day I am with out I am stronger"" It's better than being on the run or locked up I say. He's learning that people actually do give a fuck, and what it all hasthe kind to find out on her own. Im just wondering when she's go lead up to. He kept telling me he was sorry, like it was his fault. Lindsay, oh poor girl, she is lost. There is nothing I can say or do that will help her, shes so stubborn and is always ing to learn. Hopefully before it's too late. I worry about her, everytime I try to help her she just gets so pist. That's why I have to let go and stop feeling responsible for her. Ive got to let go of all the things weighing me down, get where I am supposed to be and what will follow will follow. If not then fuck it. I can't sit around and watch it all go cuz this is all I have is now. No more bullshit."

"event","fighting with rob is getting real old. i feel like we only fight cuz i always do things that make him sad. I dont want to make him sad but it seems like that is all i ever do anymore. when we fight it feels like hes always the one to talk and its always the same thing ""you do this and you do this"" the only time that were not fighting is when were having sex. we really shouldnt be doing that now either, i feel like i am so weak and cheap when we do. i mean i lke it i love him but after those names he called me and the fact that after we fuck he bails, i dont get it. everything is so complicated in our relationship, and it shouldnt have to be, we should be so happy, we have so much potential of being so great. we need trust back, we need all the romance, and all the friendship, and the butterflies back. we have it we just arent showing it cuz were too scared of each other and what the other might do to other, we need to take a chance and fall and let what ever happen happen."

"event","Rob-
Today was shitty. I'm going to be pretty straight up with you right now, that what you said about ""not having a girlfriend, and not wanting one"" sucked for me to hear. It's not the first time you've said that but our relationship is different now. I don't expect you to run back to me, just cuz i fucked up doesn't justify for you to say shitty things to me like you have. What did you think I was going to say when you told me that? Think I wouldn't care? Could you have even thought for just a second tonight when I couldnt even do a simple thing like text you back, that maybe I might be a little sad? And that maybe it was something YOU said? That sucks that you feel that way, that absolutely sucks. So we both lose huh?
It's been obvious to me that you need more time. I, on the other hand haven't wanted to admit it cuz i don't want to be away from you. It's too hard for me to try to be ""just your friend"" when we both know how I feel about you. I have friends, I have friends I could just hook up with if that was what I wanted, but I don't and especially not with you. I don't want to have to give you an ultimatum (is that how you spell that?) right now Rob But this sucks so bad, and it hurts too bad that you say you love me but don't want to be with me. What are you wanting to keep your ""options"" open for? You don't just throw those words around, you can't. Maybe I just don't understand how you can love someone and not want to be with them. I know I wronged you, and I'm sorry, but I am trying my hardest to give it all back to you... and still you keep pushing me away. You were scared before all this stuff happen, what are you so scared of? WHAT? You talk a huge game on not caring what people say or think, somehow I can't help but feel like that's part of the reason for being scared. If you beleived me when I say to you,""I love you"" then please tell me what you're scared of? Tell me what you're missing from those 3 words... cuz I can't seem to understand.
Rob- If we keep doing what we're doing it's just going to keep hurting me. I can't do it. I'm taking a HUGE chance on us. I've wanted to run so far from ever having to fall in love... and I suck, and i fell hard, and I HAVE NOT ran. even when you repeatedly push me away from you. But I can't anymore. I can't keep putting myself out there just so you can have me when you want me, and push me away when you get scared or whatever. No matter how much I hate to be a 'girl' right now, it's what I need to do, I need all or nothing. I don't want to be in love with someone who doesn't want me back. That is the shittiest feeling ever. And I don't want to feel like that.
I love you Rob and I do want to be with you and if that is not what you want then you need to let me know so that i can get over it so we CAN be ""just friends"".
So... please take time, if that's what you need. You don't need to reply to this, or message me or call me until you're ready.

"event","when did connie go crazy?? she used to be so perfect when i w a little girl and i was terrified of my dad, after the divorced their roles switched. i never understood the situation and i naver want to be able to either. what makes someone change to drastically so fast? what makes you go crazy?? when i was 17 i moved out. the worst mistake of my life... i fucked over everyone including myself i had it ok but it wasnt good enough. i had this rad girlfriend she was the sensible one. i put her in so much danger by my stupid fucking habits. iremember one night i came home at it had to be 4 or 5 in the morning i was so high and i just went into the bedroom and sat there and watched her sleep, i knew she felt it. i think it was the time i realized what the hell was going on or something close to it. she woke up and asked me if i was high again... i didnt lie, she knew it was the worst that i had ever been, i was down to 87 pounds and my eyes were so far set back in the sockets. i just remember her starting to cry and asking me to stop. worst mistake ever is ever starting swear to god . after i lost everythin i had to quit i wasnt going anywhere i swore i would never do it again i would never let something had that much control of me. quitting was probably the hardest thing ever, yuour in hell. and you are never the same again i am still my biggst critic from that. especially after all that i did it again and again. fast learner right??? i wont let someone or anything have control over me if i feel it i run. i think that that is why i i hurt people i get attached and even if they done know it they hold all the cards and i fucking run and get out of it as fast as i can. unconsciously of course, i dont have a master mind. no matter how much you give its never enough no matter how much you try to distance your self afraid that anyhting close will kill you it may seem to be working to everyone else but you know yourself the hell your in from all the distance you are putting in front of you and anything else. in your mind you are screaming and fighting with your self. no matter haw bad anything seems, it is a million times worse in your own head, you cant escape yourself you are your own worst critic.
ive never felt so small. I have never felt so shitty yet been so emotionless. there is something in this world that plays us, we're like puppets. like they want to see how we feel or how we react. i have never had my mind broadened yet so narrowed at the same time. all this realization in just a second. our lives could stop in just a minute.i dont have anything that i can hold on to i am still trying to figure that out. and something is pushing me so hard to figure it all out. my mind is so jumbled right now. i dont want anyone to talk, i just want to know that they are there, hearing what i am saying, just hearing me cry. I got a call tonight, my dad was diagnosed with cancer this morning. we are so powerless, we are nothing.
That prayer for 9 consecutive days, you pray in mourning, preparation, prayer, and indulgenced novenas. A recitation of prayers and devotions for a special purpose during these 9 consecutive days. Is starving yourself and praying to something or someone really going to make a difference in the path of your life? Let the chips fall where they may, let things float if they're going to float. Hopes and thoughts are the same thing right? People do things their own way. Its not that i dont beleive in God, my religious beleifs just arent what they used to be, which has lead me to this curiosity."

The whole L bomb thing might be getting to me, maybe i dont trust myself and i take it out on him. Its hard for me to beleive that some amazing guy can be in love with only me, to want just me... i mean look at me, i'm a complete disaster.  I dont know and maybe i will never know. some how  sometimes i feel like hes ashamed of having me around, i know he hates that people know what i did to him, and maybe it embaresses him but hes still kinda keeping me a ""secret"" girlfriend... which sucks for me cuz what i want and what i need is all or nothing, i know hes scared but its black or white when it comes to matters of the heart. there is no excuses, there is no gray area. I want to see this work. i told joan today that rob and i are serious. she told me to make sure that i knew what i was doing, in other words shes saying you know he needs to be mormon. which is totally not ehat i need to hear, i want them to be happy for me. they hated kevin cuz he wasnt mormon, but they started to like him layer, maybe cuz they knew i loved him, or maybe they knew they had no choice. if and when i take rob home they might be kinda weird in that aspect of things, they wont think that i can be ""truly"" or ""fully"" happy unless he was mormon that sucks! that is a shitty thing to think of your daughter, that is just a shitty thing. but i know it going in to it. do i need to tell kevin? all i know is that i am in love with rob, i dont want to mess this one up too. i want to do good this time, and i dont want to run and i dont want to hurt him. i want to make us happen and see where it goes."

We had an amazing night last night! You know that slow emotional sex that never really happens that often? The kind you can honestly call ""making love""? That's what is was. You can't get any closer to a person than sex like that. Holding each other, the looks, all the emotions, whispering ""I love you"" in each others ear. That is the sweetest sound, spoken so soft. 
I want this to work. I want to see us making it. Even if it doesn't last he will have left a huge print on my heart. I will have learned so much from him because Rob is so amazing. I don't want to see him hurt, I just want to make him as happy as he makes me."

"event","i promised rob that i wouldnt see lindsey. he was insecure about the whole situation after he accidentally read my last entry... i think he misunderstood it and took it for something it wasnt. i let him read the other one, why i now dont know. i mean i wanted him to know how i felt since he cant beleive a word i say. he was drunk all weekend, and i was aware of it. he asked me if i could say it to him... i told him we would talk in person about it. later that night he called and asked i told him yes. he told me back. he said to hear me say it was the most comfort for him, and he wanted to hear it again and again bcuz he said he knew it was hard for me. it was. real hard. but i said it. he told me too. that brightened my weekend. he didnt call sunday, i called him. didnt see him when i got home. but saw him today, he tells me that he did blow saturday... on top of all that alcohol... things were kinda different today, maybe it was the things said, maybe he doesnt remember, maybe he didnt mean it, maybe im reading way too into this. he tells me not to do drugs. 
i didnt see lindsey, i called her, i lied about where i was. she sounded so sad, she sounded like she really did want me there. she begged me to come and see her soon and that she really needed to see me now. i kept crying and she was so confused by it, but i felt so bad for lying to her, for not being able to see her. that was the first time ive not seen her when i was in town. it hurt. 
seeing my family was weird, kinda awkward however, i drove to meet them for lunch, no one really said anything the entire time. they didtnt like my nose ring thats for sure. after that we sat outside and again didnt really say anything. when i was leaving, my dad hugged me and started to cry. ever since i fell off the deep end, my dad cries when he sees me, mostly when he hugs me. i let him down and it hasnt been the same since. when i went home to get better from drugs i remember he didnt look at me or speak to me the entire time. i was in the bathroom door open passed out puking, dying from my come down and he would just walk on by. he didnt want to deal with it, or maybe he couldnt face the reality tht his little girl was a drug addict. wat ever it was thats how its been since. when i lived at home we could b.s and talk and whatever, now its just different. the feeling is different, i feel like i need to hide everything and not talk, afraid to upset him or something. it shouldnt have to be like that, but i know i dissappoint him, i know hes not proud of me anymore. 
I meant what i said to rob. i am so afraid of this feeling, like i said i want to run away from this feeling . i never wanted to feel this again unless i was ready. i dont think he meant it. and i am not going to chase him until he feels it. and im not going to stick around and let him take advantage of my feelings. cuz i am not getting hurt again, i am not going to have feelings one way. i know it sounds selfish but its like all or nothing thats basically what it comes down to. and i cant feel this about someone that cant reciprocate. i can move on and find someoine else. i dont want to and it wont be easy but its easier than setting myself for heartbreak. am i reading too much into this...?"

"event","what do you do when you feel like you have let yourself down for the last time?? when you decide that enough is enough... life is so full of shit. and shitty things happen that make you question yourself and others and all that you ever beleived in. how many times can you fuck yourself over until you get the point?? when i am ever going to learn? this isnt even all about me either. i am just my own worst critic and come down so hard on myself for wasting life and wasting happpiness. i just dont get it, i feel like i dont even know myself anymore. how can i feel so strong about a person and do such shitty things to them? how can i hurt people that i care about and when am i going to be able to forgive myself for it all. when does it stop? cuz everytime i think its the last time it happens again unintentional but still taking place what shouldnt. how much do i have to lose?
kevin says that i have power over men, says that if a guy falls for me he will fall hard. he was so scared to call me afraid of what i had to say next. he was never there and when he was it was always fighting and controling. no excuse though. i still did what i did and i just should have had the balls to tell him in the first place.we are too different people, we lead completely different lives. it would have been hard to make it work... he will find someone amazing, someone who will appreciate him and love him like i never could. he knows how to love. its hard to love someone so much and want to be with them but at the same time feeling and knowing that your not supposed to be with that person. its a tough thing to swallow. its hard to fall out of love.
love is a tough word. one word... when you say that word its ownership to the ear that hears it. its your heart in black or white, there is no gray in love. i want to run from it, i am so afraid of feeling it. although its amazing it cuts like a knife. i want to run from it. i have always been terrified of it. there is so much meaning to love. 
i knew that i was falling for rob. i knew it with in the first couple times of seeing him. he is just so amazing. i admire how hes himself, how he doesnt give a fuck what other people think, how he has taught me so much, how he makes me want to be a better person. just by knowing him i feel like a better person. he has played such animportant role in my life so far and have only knowing him 3 months, things happen so fast, i opened myself up to him and let him get close to me. allowing my self to feel things that i was afraid of, but didnt seem to care since it felt all worth it, just felt so good. he is everything, he is just a beautiful person inside out. i knew that i was falling, i knew it for a while. i never told him cuz i would have ran, and i was afraid of his reaction. and i fucked that one up. i fucked over a chance at happiness. what if i would have told him before? would things have still beenthe same? i see the hurt in his eyes now, i can feel it when i am around him. can he feel my guilt? can he feel my sorrow? when i am around him, he is so beautiful, and it is me that put that hurt there, the one that is supposed to care the most the one that wants more than anything to see him and make him happy. is it all over?if he forgives me can he forget? can i forgive myself? how can i forgive myself for self destructing my happiness. 
the feeling with rob is so different than that with kevin. with kevin, i loved him so much and i wanted to be with him too, but no matter how strong our feelings were or no matter how bad we wanted it to work we just knew inside that it couldnt happen. that feeling broke my heart. telling me that i couldnt be with the one i love. with rob the feeling is different,
eventhough its new and sort of just ended... when im with him, it feels ok. feel like i can be me and i am better. i feel so right about everything between us, except for the way things are now between us. he has shown me something real, something so real. made me feel things that i have been terrified of ever since the beginning of me.  i dont want to be afraid to feel this for rob. and if we dont work out then may i learn and be better and hope that i leave as big a print on his heart as he has on mine. 
i keep asking myself why, and how... i dont think my answer lies in those questions. i dont think i will ever have an answer. things happen for a reason, we learn and grow from our mistakes and heartbreaks, hopefully and if not the first  time hopefully the next or the next. in my case i should have learned already, i knew better. with jake, with matt, with lindsey, with kevin. ITS ONLY AFTER WE LOST EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE FREE TO DO ANYTHING"" maybe i just havent lost everything yet. maybe i still have alot to lose. i know i have alot to learn. i know that eventually i am going to have to let my heart break a couple more times to find something permanent. there is just this huge feeling of happiness i feel with rob and happiness is the one thing in the world that i want and if i can feel it then shit i should do what ever it takes to grab it and hold on to it.

Lindsay, lied to me, she played that so hard core, telling me about how bad she hated johnny and he treated her so bad. how she had to get away and she wanted to be together again. i was going to see what was going to happen. i drove 8 hours to get her and and left without her at all. she tries to call, i dont answer. she leaves no messages. i miss her so bad, she was my first girl ever, i cant help but just love her and fell so attached to her, i cant get hurt by her like that, i dont know why i am so sensitive toward her. she was all i needed to bring out me. she chose him and she screwed me over, she chose in front of my eyes. that hurt so bad.
dad hates me, i am not religious enough, i am not good enough, i was always so difficult to handle, he turned his back and stuck his head in the sand when shit went really bad. now hes talking to me now that i am doing better than i was.
kevin thats the love of my life i want to marry him so bad. he is so awesome, how could i have done all those shitty things to him? hes supposed to be my best friend through out eternity. i am trying harder now but i fell that i am never going to be good enough. the bad has a hold of me. he tries so hard for the both of us. to keep us together.
i cant do anything right. i have been in this same state of mind for too long, when is it my turn to be happy? to be comfortable with who i am and where i am at in my life? i cant seem to find my self. i am learning new things everyday. about life about people and the world and about myself.its hard to keep up and its hard to know how to place priorities. i cant find a peace of mind for a day to be confident in anything or anyone at all. i know things are wrong but i go through with it everytime, i need to grow some balls and learn to walk away from things that will cause regret."

in sheets beneath the blacked-out windows' makeshift night
oblivious to midday sunshine--

I am content!

That is all.

Looking forward to more hangouts, and my Doctor Who.

Warning! Good Times ahead."

"event","I've decided that the past year has been mostly work and not enough friends. Therefore I want to reconnect with all my friends.

Haven't heard from me in a while? Drop me a line and we'll talk, hang out."

"event","I figured that maybe if I reconfigured <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/friends/add.bml?user=dariansfriends"">the Darian's Friends Webcomic LiveJournal feed</a> to show the entire strip instead of just a thumbnail, that more people would want to <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/friends/add.bml?user=dariansfriends"">add it to their friendslist by clicking here.</a>

From now on, all new comic releases will be fully syndicated to LJ, without requiring a clickthrough to the <a href=""http://dariansfriends.com"">Darian's Friends Webcomic main website</a>.

The more people that have it conveniently placed on their friendlist, <a href=""http://cuteteenboy.livejournal.com/friends"">like it is on mine</a>, for example, the more new readers I find, and the less I have to cry at night (j/k).

"event","Hey guys well a LOT has been going on in my life. well not really but its ll confussing and like UGH. well on saturday june something, me and kyle broke up. youd think i would be heart broken but im not, well he was gonna do it and i was ready so it just worked out. well how it happened is really weird....ok it goes like this........i tried to have chris to tell him to do it cause i couldnt and he said no and i begged and begged and i was talking to tyler and a dif kyle. and i think tyler got tired of my complaining so in the tournment it was chris tyler kyle VS. kyle (X) and after the game when chris and them won tyler went up to him and was like she doesnt wanna go out with ya anymore and he was like its over, told ya it was weird and the worst part i i couldnt really enjoy myself at the game cause i felt like i was doing the wrong thing, then i found out later in the week that he had been thinking about doing it for a MONTH and none not one of my friends and the balls to tell me, o man that ticked me off, and he was being a real jerk to me towards the end of everything so now im glad that its over, and the thing that sucks the most is that i found out from one of my girlfriends who i went to flordia with what he was doing, that didnt go over to well with me, his lost cause im fine, and now i like this guy chris enlow, and i wasnt dumping kyle for chris even though thats what everyone thinks, but its not true. i didnt know that i liked chris till i had already made up my mind to dump, but didnt have the balls to do it for almost two weeks, so enough about that...anyways i was in flordia for a week, wow that was fun so many guys were hittin on us, and most of then werent cute or my age, or even close to my age.  someof them i swear were like 21, hello only 15. lol i got a really awesome tan! :)  and now nothing else is going on in my life cept im never home right now cause im always on vacation or at a camp so i probley wont be on here till AUG, again so ill fill ya in on my life then , ttyl

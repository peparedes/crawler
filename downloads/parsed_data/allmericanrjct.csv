But i think i'm going to start back up with updating this.

Well, summer is almost done. 
That's fucking crazyyyy! And my senior year is already here, 
time freaking flies. This is no joke crazy. 
I'm really excited, but i'm scared at the same time. 

We had our first football game of the year yesterday, 
and we won! Our dance was pretty good =) Great Job Girls! 
It's a great way to start off the season. 

Dance Team is going great, I love the team. 
I'm excited for the season even more now that like schools getting back in sesson.
That just means competition seasons starting, and i can't wait to learn our dances!

JAZZ DANCE= ADDICTED BY KELLY CLARKSON
POM DANCE = ""BAD"" THEME (basically it has songs w/ bad in it ? get it? hahaha)
HOMECOMING DANCE= you'll just have to wait and see for that one. =)

Let's see... boys. YEAH you all confuse me.
End of story w/ that one. 

Work is going okay i guess. I don't really work that much, but it's still decent. 
Today was crazyyy at work tho. SSOOOO MANY people came in at once... listen to this...
a party of 20,
a party of 6,
then random parties of 2-6 kept coming in. 
I was freaking out, i've never worked when its that busy before.
And i'm not joking either. 
And then my manager told me take this party of four over to the booth, but rob got it. So then my manager said take this party of 6 to that table and rob will be happy to get it. So i seat them there, 2 min later rob freakin comes yelling at me, and my manager saw him, so my manager appologized.

Because see there is a rule that the waiters n shit can't yell at us. 
We're doing our job seating people, especially if our managers tell us to put them at a certain table. I was about to cry. It was crazy there. 
But when i left, my manager complimented me on how well i worked and stuff today. and he told me he wouldn't forget it either. =) so that kinda cheered me up a lil. 

So theres a few concerts coming up that i'm really excited to go to! 
We haveeee... 
Gym Class Heroes - Sept 22nd
New Found Glory/Cartel/The Early NOvember- Oct 13
Hellogoodbye/Dave Melillo/Cute is What We Aim For- Oct 26

so leave me some comments, 
and i'll probally post an entry w/ pictures later 

PEACE!"

I just haven't really felt like it cuz no one really comments anymore. 

I dunno lately I've felt emotionaly distressed. I haven't really told anyone that, cuz well, lately some people just haven't seemed like they've wanted to listen to me. Things are getting better though I guess you can say. I really miss some of my friends. Some I hardly get the chance to talk to and or see and it really sucks. I hate it when some people will tell me AMY WE HAVEN'T HUNG OUT AND SO LONG! then like make plans without me, while I am stuck at home sitting on my ass doing nothing ? Oh well, doesn't bother me too much. 

Dance has been pretty good. We had our extravaganza on friday. Thanks to all that came =], it means a lot that you guys went... well those that could make it! It went pretty well. Monday we're learning our pom dance, and i'm over excited.

"event","Howdy. 

well things have been claming down i guess you can say. 

<b>Dance Team-</b> We had our competition on Saturday, and we placed 4th overall out of 7 teams. Which isn't bad. The head of UDA told our coach she thought we would have gotten 2nd or 3rd place, but oh well. lol I'm still really proud of us, our dance looked really good. I heard Ike (they won first) used their Nationals Routine from last year... so no wonder they won lol. The head of uda said that we've gotten SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better, she complimented us so much. And she never gives compliments, so that right there alone, is a huge compliment. We worked really hard, and In my mind we kicked some major ass. =] GREAT JOB GIRLS <3! We looked so like mad at the world out there, it was interesting. 

I really don't know what else i've been doing besides school and dance lol. 

OMG OKAY! 
READY? 
of course you are. 
So you all know how mr.french grades rediculously? 
So i had a d (in danger of failing) in his class, when i get a's and b's in english usually. 
I brought my notebook into him the other day, 
and OMG. IT RAISED MY GRADE ALL THE WAY UP TO A C/C+ =] you have no idea how happy that makes me y0. 

Wow, i read steph-a-roo's last entry, and it seriously made me sad/scared. 
WE ARE ALMOST HALF WAY THROUGH OUR JUNIOR YEAR. 
Pretty soon we're going to be applying for scholorships and colleges, paying for senior things, and entering our senior year. 
I really don't want next year to come, because I don't want all my amazing senior friends now to leave (like my bffe's julie and becky and raffi, and all the leadership people, and people like kevin, chris, joe, chris, jamie, adam, etc) It's so scary to think that the first day of school next year, they won't be there. =[ 
Erg, I better keep in touch with all these kids, if i don't man. I don't know what i'd do. 
Then seriously it's going to be so scary this summer already we have to take SENIOR PICTURES. 
WOAH. I remember thinkin my freshman year like dude thats so far away, and now it's like almost here. 
I remember in like 4th grade, we wrote a paper about what it would be like when we graduate, and I said CARS WOULD FLY 
haha wow. 
But man, that really makes me sad. =[

OYE I'm freeeezing in my house its so cold. 

Man, somethings feel like their falling apart =[ 
Anyone have some permenent glue? heh


Well right now this is all i can think of..! 
Leave me some comments. 
Later playas


(P.S. Listen to BEEP by the pussycat dolls) 
it's so funny HAHHAAA"

I've been extremely busyyyy with school/dance/leadership/friends/games and all that great stuff. It's been stressful but it's all slowly but surley paying off i guess you can say. 

<b>Ice Cream Social</b>- I got to be in charge of it with Mica! and Emily. I got to make up a dnace for the senior court. Which may i say is like 20 AMAZING seinors. (well i knew 18, plus the 2 hosts so i say 20)We had constant practices at mica's house and my house. It was always a blast. Their always hilarious. Planning all of it was stressful! I had to buy 500 slices of ice cream. That was sweet. haha It all payed off, we made over $1000 and we're donating it to charity. The show went pretty well i guess. Little bumps, but over all okay.

NOTE TO SELF: finish comitte report. 

<b>Pep Rally/Dance Team</b>- I loved our dance for homecoming. We performed it at the pep rally, and i got a lot of compliments. I always love dancing at pep rallys, their always fun. Everyone went nuts on our last song ""welcome to detriot city"" oyeeee. I still think nothing can top last years tho lol That one's always going to be my favorite. But practices were okay, yet stressful. I mean overall our dance went well, we showed the school what we can do. If you don't like it. uhm too bad. lol We worked hard on that dance. whateverr it was sweet. 

<b>Homecoming COURT</b>- So i was nominated to be homecoming princess for the class of 2007. and i WON. Holy crap, i was so surprised. when i get the picture of me when they announced my name i'll show you. But yeah, Ross and I won for that. I was exrtemly surprised that people voted for me, and i was happy.

<b>Homecoming.</b>- Homecoming was okay? i guess you can say. The DJ sucked. But this is how it went .... 
-Decorated the school from 8-12
-Got my hair done at 1
- Got ready at like 230-430
-Ross came at 445 and took pictures
-Went to Bj's house for more pictures
-Went to Papa Vinos and ate and saw bunches of people ther. IT WAS SOO GOOD. 
- Went to the dance till 11.
It twas fun. 

<b>FALL OUT BOY/STARTING LINE/MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK/BOYS NIGHT OUT/PANIC! AT THE DISCO CONCERT</b>Well, Well, Well. Can you say ... Amazing? Panic at the disco was really good, i love themmmm! Boys night out was a lot better at the warped tour 2 years ago, we''ll leave it at that. Motion city soundtrack was pretty sweet i like themmm.  The starting line was come on freaking awesome. I love them. I love the lead singers hair and dance moves lol. WOOP! Okay fall out boy do i even have to say, They WERE AWESOME. NO JOKE. Pete's sexy. Before the concert robyn and andrea came to get me, that was an adventure lmao. Good times!

Me - Steph - Andi- Robyn -- WE LOVE YOU PETE
Pete- THIS ONES FOR THE GIRLS ON TOP!
fuck yeah. he dedicated a song to us. 

I love them no joke. lol 

<b>School</b>- Good I guess you can say. My two favorite hours of the day are Leadership and Newspaper, cuz well they like give me a break, their realieving i guess you can say, and i love the people in both my classes. I like all my classes and the people in them, but those are my two faves.


<b>This Weekend</b> Good in a way. Yesterday i went to the football game with leesh, and met up there with josh, james and krystal. It was a lot of fun. We kicked ass no joke. Then we went to taco bell, and then to sherry's it was funnnnn. Then i drove home. hahaha Today i made pants with Tara and Juliet. ahhh it was so much fun. their great, and juliets mom's so funny. I like my pants. mu hahahaa Then uhm now i'm here doing homework. Tomorrow i have dance from about 10-4 then the team's going to Coney Island. SWEEEEET hani yummm. hahaha Then yea thats about it.

"event","Eh Hi. 

Weds- wasn't a good day, school was retarted. practicce went well , but then didn't. We got our warmups their really cute. Weds was also the 23rd?24th? anniversary that my grandpa died, I never met him. I wish i could have :(. I miss him, even tho i never knew him. Pray for my grandma guys, please? Thank you. That was basically my day. The end. I don't want to get into anything.

Thursday- Better than weds, but still not the greatest. School was okay, people are so FUCKING RUDE i swear on mylife. I was walking around the lunch room, getting donations for the Hurricane for Leadership to give to the red cross. This girl was bitching at me ""ARe you in leadership? (i said yeah) You are the 4th person to bug us to donate it's not my fault they had a hurricane, i don't want to donate"" and she went on and on, I was like ""Leadership is organized thanks, we aren't going to assign people to tables and go around  I'm just walking around with the can not bugging anyone to donate, and if they want to then they can"", and she tryed to say something and i was like ""no thanks bye"" and walked away. God DamN!N!! You people at mott are so cold, and selfish. No joke. The people that donated aren't... but honestly!  Those people need all the help they can get, they are losing family, losing their home, everything! And all you can think about is how much money you have? god damn. You can give a penny, a nickle, a dime, a quarter... Anything can help. Everything adds up to something, and if your that kind of selfish sonofabitch that can't even give like 25 cents, then I hope you can go through something like those people are, then you'll realize how it feels not to have nething, i'm surprised you have friends with that attitude half of you people do. Honestly if i had money, i'd donate it all to help out those people. I'd go down there to help if i had to! Even if it ment risking my life. But whatever i'm done with that rant.

We had a game yesterday against cousino. We lost =[ but it's okay. Cousinos 10th in the state, go figure. But our dance looked relaly good even tho our music was fucked up. No joke girls, it looked awesome. I dont care what people say it did. I watched it and iw as like DAMN! The game was fun, hung around with julie n leesh, then i saw lee n donovan, it was good to see them. Tehn i saw ANDREA AND ROBYN AND KELLI! OMGOMG! i love them! i missed themmmM! After the game we had a dance team meeting, and talked about everything that went on. After i went to coney with emily tara doogie quarter tim and dustin. It was sooo funny. quarter was like burp burp burp burp burp GOT MILK? lmfao it was hillarious. Alex, Pat, Lee, Brandon n bunches of others were there also.  It was fun. I went on the computer when i got hom, then i went to bed cuz i was exhausted. 

Today- Not a good day so far. I talked to julie becky n ross on the phone. Julie ur the greatest friend ever just to let you know, i dunno what i'd do without you. Later on i think i'm hanging out with ross.

Blah Everything just honestly sucks. I feel so bad for everyone down in Louisiana. It's horrible down there, people are luding stores, raping eachother, and it's horible. I wish i could go down there and help, but I can't. I'm so stressed out, this school years going to kill me. Dance team is getting better now since we talked about everything. We're going to nationals. awwwwyeahhh. But anyways. 

*sigh* 
i guess leave some comments. 
i'll talk to ya'll later. 

bye.

Then she picked me up, we picked up all the jerseys, then tara and kristina. We went to the Game in Romeo. Even tho we lost, it was a lottttt of fun. We had some girl talks ahha, and just had a great old time. After we saw adam get pulled over , and a car almost hit us. lmao Then stina had to go home, so then we dropped her off then danced in the mott parking lot. lmao Then me em and tara went to coney with dustin tim and raff. It was fun. A bunch of people were there. Then i came home at like midnight. lol 

Saturdayyyyy- Guitar lessons. Then came home did nothing for a while, then rachel n nick stopped by. Then i did a little bit of school shopping with Julie! Yayyyyy it was sooo much fun. We talked alot which is always good. Then at lakeside i saw.... Sam! aww i missed her. MR.KAY! ahhh hahaha. That guys awesome. Then i saw Sandra! aw it was good to see her. Then we saw blerta at sears. lol It was fun, we got sesame chicken YUM. Then we stopped at beckys and looked at her senior pictures, their sooo perdyy! Then i came home and watched Constantine. It was a good and confusing movie. lol 

Sunday- Church, then shopping with my madre. Went to kohls, aeropostle, american eagle, target, and office max. haha. My mom's crazy lol it was fun. Then i did nothing the rest of the day... 

I WATCHED THE VMAS. mkay yeah who won the mtv2 award... FALL OUT BOY =] I like screamed lmao my mom was laughing at me so hard. haha 
My favorite performances were.... Fall Out Boy, Kanye West, My Chemical Romance... and MC HAMMER lol. Kelly Clarkson went crazy when she performed ""since you've been gone"" i was like jesus woman. Green Day won a lot, which was cooooool. 

Today- uhhm I have dance team compettion tryouts, and i'm so nervous i gotta go practice. 


Today is the <b>last</b> day of summer =[. It was a pretty good summer. From the Vans Warped tour to the Rock n Roll hall of fame to Dance Camp n all that Jazzzz. It was awesome i'd have to say. I got to hang out with a lot of people, not as many as i wanted to but hey i can't complain.  It was overall a good one, it had its downs but whatever thats in the past. This summer i've met fall out boy, the starting line, the click five, pepers ghost and honestly (yeah their concert was like one of the last weeks of school so i consider that summer). Which is ffreaking awesome. and pete remembered me. ohhh yes. I have nights and day's i'll never forget, with the people i love which are my friends and family. Julie showed me this paragraph Jen wrote in her journal and it made me realize, that this is my <b>last</b> year of school with some people, a lot of them are good friends or best firends. That just saddens me. Like tomorrow is my last frist day of school with people like julie, becky, jamie, raff, kevin etc. That makes me sad, because when next year comes around, i'm going to go into shcool without them there. =[ Okay i dont wanna keep going cuz i'll cry hahhaa. 

Well thats all for now 
Leave some loveee
and i'll update later

well yeah i haven't updated in a lil while so here weee gooo....

<b>Friday-</b> Had practice, killed my ankle haha, then steph stina n me went to the mall and steph and i got our fall out boy tickets. I really don't remember what i did after that. Who knows haha. 
 <b>Saturday-</b> Gutiar lessons, got pizza, doctors (had 2 moles removed, on my head ahhh), pretty much rested the rest of the day. 
 <b>Sunday-</b> Church, i really don't remember what else i did sunday. I think that was the day i hung out with Leesh, Joe, Ross and B. It was a lot of fun. If that wasn't the day oh well i did that haha.
<b>Monday</b>- No practice, pretty much did nothing, practiced technique at the school with steph, tara, juliet, julie, and candice. Came home uhhm, did nothing pretty much. Went to the mall with my mom and went to aeropostle... ahah saw nick lmao. Then i came home, and went to the movies with raffi, dustin and emily. We saw the 40 year old virgin.. yeah i'm not 17 and i saw an R movie *gasp amy snuck in* who cares lol. It was a really funny movie. After, we went to emily's car, and they (dustin n raff) said dance wasn't a sport... haha oh boy, i clamed my self, and emily went off at them oh boy lmao. Oh well. Then emily and i got mcdonalds, and went to vrooms house. That was my day. 


<b>Today</b>-- Woke up at 6, got ready n such. Lauren picked me up at 6:45 and we headed off to registration. We registered first and then helped out with IDs. I got to see like everyone... literally lol. It was funnn i guesssss. talked to brad n nick n such. It was cool. Got out round 245ish-3ish? Brad gave me a ride home. I love ms.pam. She was like Amy ur so beautiful. i waslik eohhhgeeze haha. Then i came home n did nothing. Then later on ross picked me up and me, him, bj, julie n paul were over there for a bon fire. It was fun. B sang for us lmao. The cucumber farted lmao. Oh man Itwas fun those guys are awesome... Oh yeah i'm getting a candy apple red escalade HAHAH.
Then ross dropped me off, and that was that.

Now i'm getting bitched at by my mom for having a turkey/cheese sandwich yesterday. MKAY MOM. One fucking slice of cheese, and 2 pieces of turkey. Okay... Like honestly what the hell. Then she yelled at me for ahaving a little bit of ice cream today? WHO CARES. I don't eat this crap every day. SHe's like yeah i made you some yogurt bars to eat instead of ice cream, oh yeah for lunch tomorrow make urself a hardboiled egg. What the hell. 

I Fucking don't need that. I honestly have the lowest self esteem right now, and she's making it worse. Sure i'm not the fucking skinnest girl, but i'm not fucking huge. Come on. Honestly, I'm sick of putting up with her, tomorrow this is what she'll be like with our uniforms ""you should have gotten a size bigger"" BULL SHIT. I was freaking measured for that. So no. My mom was going from this morning YOURE SO BEATIFUL to WATCH WHAT THE HELL YOUR EATING. I've fucking gained weight because of gaining muscle in my legs, and honestly it pisses me off. Sure i lost fat and gained muscle. But l;sdkjfl;askdjfl;akjsd;flkjasd;lfkjas. I know i'm <strike>not</strike> never going to be skinny. People say i am now, but i'm sorry it's just like I'm sorry but no Amy Shaw isn't skinny, i'm not 130-140 pounds like people think. no i'm not a  size 5 in jeans that people ask me if i am. Compliments are always nice, and i appreciate them. <b>Half the time i think people say nice shit to me is because they know i have a low self esteem and their just trying to make me feel better. Well, It's def. not working. I'm sorry.</b> I'm so pissed off because of all this right now. I swear, just the thought of food right now is like making me think....
Okay gotta lose some weight, get in shape, eat less, just to fucking make my mom happy. OKAY MOM.

Ugh I hate thinking about how much i weigh and all that shit cuz it pisses me off, I honestly like cry thinking about all this stuff, cuz I know that i'll never be able to look how i'd like to. I'd love to be a size 5, i'd love to be skinny. WHAT EVER.

Eh i'm done with my freaking rant. I'm sorry you had to listen to that =[. I'm crying over this UgH!

<b>Tuesday</b>- Went to ohio, stopped at like 872643 stores, and i drove a lot too. Cabella's is an interesting fishing/hunting store. It's cool tho. Our hotel was nice. I also called julie i belevie. I aslo ran/worked out for about n hour or so. 

<b>Weds</b> Nothing really, ran for about 30 min straight while watching mtv2. yessssssss. Then went on the computer at the hotel, then this lady wanted to go on so i got off, and i looked back there four hours later... she's still in there. wth. I went swimming and in the hot tub and watched an hour and a half of Lauguna Beach <33. Anyways, I didn't really do nething that day. 

<b>Thursday!</b> Went to the ***Rock n Roll Hall of Fame***. It was so sweet. 6 LEVELS OF PURE AWESOMENESS. I say it was worth 20 bucks a person. They had everything from Madonna's bra to Jimi Hendrix's drawings to Britney Spear's outfits. Its a lot of stuff, but it's soooo coool. They had a sweet Tommy/The Who exhibit, and lots of other things. I loved it Majorly. I also drove lots that day. Then we headed on home and i got home round 930ish. 

<b>Friday</b> yesterday we had dance practice, and we practice in the aux gym... and then they kicked us out cuz they just uhm waxed the floor and did the floor cuz it's their ""1000 dollar gym"" as they said. Gayy, it was hard to dance on tho since it was really sticky n such. So we danced outside, tara and i taught some of our kick line, and we went over home routine and we talked for a lil bit. Then emily and i worked out, i saw raffi yayyyye =]! pluse like 839745 other people. haha We danced also. My turns are getting mucho better. Then she dropped me off at home and i did nothing. THen Margaret, Stina, Steph and I went bowlling and to Coney. It was a lot of funnn! Marg. Fell awwww i felt bad, but it was so hillarious. Those girls are soo funny i <3 them. THen steph came over, and we were like laughing so much, i almost peed my pants. It was soooooo hillarious. She's great. Then my mom dropped her off, and we watched this video for history that me, her, and tom did in 9th grade ! omggg it was sooo dumb i dont get how we got liek a b+ on it. It was hillarious. lmaoooo. Oh boY! Good Times!

<font size=""+1"">Dance Camp was Sweet.</font>

<lj-cut text=""D, D-U, D-U-C-K-S. We like ducks!"">

Thursday----- (Last Week) We met up at mott, and had to take pictures for coach writght. Then we headed over to the wcc and practiced. We went to the Hotel and Chilled and swam. Then we went out to DINNER! lol At the Rainforest Cafe at GreatLakesCrossing. It was so much fun. Steph, Vroom, Lauren, Catie and Stina are so funny. Our dinners were yummy. Then we went back to the hotel, chilled and swam somemore and had our candle light. Awww yay, I love those girls. Steph is hilarious. Then we all just went to beddd. 

Friday- We got all spiffy and ready, then we all went to Timmy Ho ho's! (Tim Hortans). yummy. The car i was in (lauren's with tara juliet candice and me) we got lost lol. Then we headed over to OU! We unpacked, and I saw Ms.Geri! Yay! Then we got situated in our rooms, practiced, had pizza, then Lauren Me Coach and Vroom had a meeting for camp with all the other coaches and capitains. We put people into their A routines. I was in the Level 4 Team Routine with Vroom, Catie, Tara and Stina. It's sweet for shizz. Then we had homeroutine evaluations. Wow, Chippewah was so good, and so were some other teams. We did pretty good, everyone was singing and clapping around with our music! Ross, B, Jill, Krystal and Mike all came. It twas sweet. Then we all ""went to bed"" Catie and I talked till 2:30 YAY! I love Catios>! Also we got the ""on the ball"" award from the UDA staff. That's sucha good thing to get. 

Saturday--Got up early. Booo, then i went to All Stars. I knew i wasn't going to make it, but Hey! It's worth a try! Then everyone came, and we did stretches, reviewed a routine and stuff. After Lunch i had another meeting and we put people in their B Routines! I was in Level 3/4 Kick Shake It! With ms.Tara Mace! She's so funny. It's a really killer kick line. It killed my legs for sure. Then after we had a picture party and technique and such. Then at dinner time we had another meeting, and put people into their C Routines. I was in Level Four Hip Hop with Vroom and Stina to Hey bitty! It's so freaking sweeeeeeet. Heck yes. then we did ICE CREAM AND CAKE! and Peanut butter jelly and other stuff and headed to beddd. 

Sunday- Hmmm nothing relaly exciting. Reviewed all of our routines, and then we had A Routine/All Star Evaluations. My mommy and pappiiii came :) YAY!So did ross and b. That was nice of them :). Vroom, Tara, Stina, Catie and I got blue ribbons for the team routine. cuz we're sweet. Then Tara and I practiced our Kick, and stina and vroom and i practiced our hiphop.Then i had a meeting with coach, lauren and vroom in vrooms room.We talked till 1:30. We couldn't stop laughing. Then I came back , and Catios was sleeping so i just went to bed. 

Monday-- LAST DAY OF CAMP. We performed our B and C routines, and got evaluated. I got all blue ribbons (which is the best you can get sweeet). Then we did our a routines again, drill downs, ice cream and cake. Then we did awards. We qualified for nationals! =] Vroom, Lauren and I also got invited to go to the Macy's day parade for thanksgiving and perform since we're captains. Yay! i doubt i'll do it tho. Then Ms. Kristina got the All Star Award! YAY Then camp was like over....


Camp was awesome. I got a lot closer to a lot of the new girls and i love them! So many hillarious things happened, and I'm a lot closer to everyone. We have a great team this year. These girls have a lot of heart for the game, and i really hope they don't lose it. If they do, I 'll be kicking some butt ! =] JayKay. But to be on a team like this you need to have the heart to succeed. Girls that have come and gone on the team, have the heart for dance just not the dance team. Dance teams a part of my life and i wouldn't trade it for anything. This team this year, is going to go far and do great things. Don't doubt us, cuz then we'll doubt you. We make the commitment and not the excuses. We're the lovers and fighters of dance. We will be kicking ass this year. So when you hearsome one talking about the WM Magix, be like oh yeah, their kick ass =] And don't think i'm trying to be cocky about the dance team saying we're sweet and all, because i know/ have a feeling that during the season... u guys will be like whos that? wait WHAT? WOAH THATS OUR DANCE TEAM. Seriously. Don't think i'm psyco for saying all that either. Ask anyone on the team this year. They will most likely say the same things just in different wordings.

Well where to start? 

Thursday-- Later on in the day I hung out with Julie. It was so mucho fun. We stopped at Best Buy and got some stuff. I got the new All American Rejects cd =] WooP! It's soooo good. Then we headed over to her house, and chilled for a few. We went swimming! Her pool was like a bath. Swimming was hillarious, and our dance is kick ass man. We talked a lottt, and We did some MTV Pilates... holy shit. I thought was going to die. It killed. Her parents got us baskenrobins yummy. Julie and I haven't hung out like that in a while, so it was a great time.  She dropped me off at 1030! Eeeep. good day fo sho. 

Fridayyy-- Had dance practice in the morning, and i think i lost every ounce of water in my body =]. Then worked out afterwords with stina. Woop. Afterwords, I came home and rested for a while and ate lunch. Then i went running, and while i was running Ryan scared the shit out of me and honked his horn at me when i passed his house lol. 

Later on I went  to Allison's graduation party!!! I picked up stina, and we headed over to Mike's house. It was a lot of fun =]. Emily, Katie, Mike P, Christina C, Mike F, Wilmo, Kathy, Curtis, my buddy Kevin, and lots of others were there. It was so much fun. Stina, Potter and I were jumping on the trampolene and Mike S came on and did like2934875293485937 flips in a rowww. Psyco i know. Stina had to leave =[, and i talked a lot to emily. We had some MEATY BALLS that were really good lmao. Meat Balls you perves. Then we had cake and chilled. Emily, Potter, Steph, and I talked for a while, then mike s joined haha. Mike showed me his basement, and its pretty sweet. Eeee I LOVE HIS KITTY, it's like the freaking cutest thing everrr.

We gave them dirty looks and becky was all like don't fucking call us skanks we arent skanks, as they have this skank ass girl in a cooch high skirt and in a tank top. God FAGS. So there was this guy that just got out of his car when they said that, and becky was like to him... do you think we're skanks? and he was like Nope. and we were like thank you. So we got back in kristen's car, and when ew drove past them again... kristen and i flicked them off and becky yelled FAGGGGGGGGGGGSSSSSS lmao It was funny, the boys just like looked at us like what happened. haha

I've actually been doing stuff lately, it's good to get out of my house. *thanks god* 

Wends--- Dance practice, it went really well and we did a lot of conditioning. Then i came home and took a shower. Then leeshieeeee picked me up and we went out to lunch, and talked mucho! It was fun =] Then i had drivers training. That was pretty much my weds. 

Thursday- I really don't remember. Just cleaned i guess, and went running. I saw Skop, Mr. Milanov and Rami. Then it was storming. Wootie woo. Then i had drivers training. and i went driving. Parallel parking is too freaking easy for words. That was my boring day. 

Friday--- No Dance! I woke up pretty late. Andrea wanted me to come over. So i went over there =]! It was me, her, and lauhoff (haven't seen her in forever). It was so much fun we laughed so much. Eeep Good times. I <333 those guys. We went swimming, and talked, watched Mean girls (ahh i love that movie) and laughed. lol Good times. That was my friday. 

Today- Woke up early, cuz i had to drive at 8. I drover till about 915ish. Came home did nothing for 2 hours and went to guitar lessons. Worked on manic monday by relient k and went over chord theory. Good stuff. Then after guitar lessons I went to stephs, and we headed out to lakeside. We went to mcdonalds, and there were these really hotttt emo boys there =P. (The story about them will come later) Then we went to lakeside. I saw eric burger... i always see him there. We went around looking for tank tops for dance team and put a bunch on hold at weathervane. They didn't have the other part at forever 21 tho. I was like [                  ] < that close to buying the mae cd =[ i kinda think i should of now BOOO.We laughed to much, it was funnnnnn. We danced on her front lawn, and saw brandon. HMMM. OH OKAY! So were walking in Lakeside... and the hot older emo boys were there! We walk past them and they look at us and one goes ""WE SAW YOU GUYS AT MCDONALDS"" hahahah I was like ""WE SAW YOU TOO""  hahaha. Then we didn't see them for a long time, then i had to Pee! So when nature calls come on ya gotta go, so we were walking to the bathroom as we're walking in who walks out from the guys? The hot emo guys! They said again ""WE SAW YOU GUYS AT MCDONALDS!"" and we all like laughed and i was like at the same time ""WHAT UP!"" and did some hand calp thing ahahhaha lmao it was great. I stayed with steph till like what? 6 ish ? We went to Lakeside 2 times, and Oakland once. cuz you know we're sweet. and when we went to oakland, and i went into aeropostle... nick was there and he was like WHAT UP! lmaooo (julie u know who i'm talking about hahaha)Anyways.

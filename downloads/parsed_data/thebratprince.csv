"event","Today I announce that I do not know,
know what life intends for me,
what life I may yet to live.

I do not know if the sky is still up
or if my heart is still in one piece.
I have no idea what tomorrow may bring,
I do not care.

I am nothing and there is nothing, save love.
And I can tell you that not from what I know, but what I feel.
Love does not know...it just is."

"event","We live in dangerous times. 

The common person's opinions are voiced by 
corporations that are controlled by unregulated companies and/or self promoting power brokers, not by the common person. 

If you speak out for your beliefs you are branded a traitor, and must fear for your safety and freedom, and the safety and freedom of your loved ones. 

Money has become the highest power, the rights of individual freedom are slowly stripped away in the name of the ""greater good"". National Security has replaced common sense. We are quickly becoming a nation with a voice that is a sound bite. 

I was taught this country was established in the name of those who were oppressed by tyrannical fascists, who made laws to fatten their own wallets. When did this become a positive motivating force ? 

The men and women who founded The United States Of America surely did not intend for their dreams of a place where all peoples may live a life of peace and harmony to become what it is today. 

I love this country, it is my home. But I fear I am only allowed freedom so long as it suits those who seek to control me for their own selfish reasons. 

On the 4th of July I think of many things. I think fondly of my grandfather, who was given the pistol of a dead officer on a blood covered battlefield, and then ordered to lead his fellow Americans in a war against those who would seek to rule them in the name of the Nazi party. I think of those who gave their lives to ensure that the dream of equal rights for all human beings would be carried on. 

It is my sincere hope that on this day that we celebrate our beloved country, that we stop and consider the direction we are headed in."

"event","sometimes in life you dont tell someone you care about what your thinking..maybe you think they dont want to hear it...maybe you 
dont want to admit it...in the end that road always leads to the same place... 

such a wicked little game we play with ourselves...kisses in the dark, hiding, 
waiting for something better, waiting for 
for them to feel like you do, sometimes just waiting.. 

sometimes you don't know yourself, sometimes the truth is hidden behind hope 
sometimes its so obvious you can't see it. 

but sometimes...your just you...and no matter what...thats good enough...don't 
ever let anyone tell you its not...they arent inside...all the stars in the wink and nod, we're all so fragile and the harder you try to be the more your heart turns to glass..careful not to shatter it 

little room inside...my white room where I dance...alone happy and free"

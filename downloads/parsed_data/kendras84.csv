"event","So my numbness is still dwelling deep within me.  Maybe I'm just an unhappy person incapable of happiness.  There's so much I want and so much I don't need.  I love Steph, but sometimes it feels weird.  She still calls WhoreBag and I try to tell her how it upsets me not to mention how disrespectful it is.  My lonliness is starting to get to me.  Playing a videogame to hide myself isn't working anymore and working like a fucking dog isn't either.  I want to go to Japan (things are holding me back) and everyone gives me the same advice and so on and so forth...  but I don't want their advice because they can never take it themselves.  I'm not a strong enough person...  I'm trying.  I want Steph to love me like she did.  I still get excited and happy when I know she's coming over, or when she gives me that smile that I tell myself is meant for me only.  It's frustrating.  I hate many of the choices I have made in my life.  I hate having no money to do as I please.  I know it does no good to wish or hope or even to condemn things.  I'll just keep floating along and beating into the rocks as I make my way in life.  Happiness is an illusion that one day with hopefully become real.  I want someone to talk to, someone who will just listen.  Good news is, I get tutored by my Japanese teacher and it's free.  I am going to go to Japan.  FUCK IT.  I am going one day when I am ready.  When I've mastered it, I am going there...maybe sooner.  Hopefully I'll hear from one you (you who you are) soon...just so I know at least you're happy.  Friends and acquaintances past and present, you give me a fucked up sense of hope..."

"event","Well, I got an early V-day's present in the form of a chihuahua...So I named him Copper Carter Cash (Copper from Fox & the Hound, and Carter-Cash as in June and Johnny).  You'd think me wanting 3-4 manga at roughly the price of $40-50 would be a better gift than a $300 dog that I have no room for in my little rented out basement, right?  Apparently not, lol.  My cats are sooooo mad at me, but I think they like him because they try playing with him when I'm not looking.  I used to make fun of all the people who owned a little dog and took them everywhere, but now I understand why they do...because it's like a living action figure!  I am going to dress him in all sorts of nifty outfits.  I think I might make little anime costumes and stuff for him.  Then he could be a kick ass ninja one day, a feudal ninja the other, or a supernatural futuristic ninja another....^_______^!  Just kidding, but I am going to make him some cool little outfits.  He's not yappy or mean like other Chihuahuas...I don't even know if I am spelling it right, but that's okay because he doesn't care either way.  He's a fawn like color with a little bit of black on his back and white on all four of his paws.  He also has one little white patch in the middle of his head.  Okay I need to possibly get back to work.  Just thought I'd let every one know I'm alive and still thrashing about in the current that is life..."

Working two jobs and going to school full time...my Japanese is coming along awesomely...  I feel sort of weird updating at the student desk because the professors like to annoy the piss out of us here...  I am exhausted...oh I get to learn to engrave this week!  So my resumee skills are now: creating/updating/maintaining a webpage, various office errands (copying, faxing [stuff I already knew how to do]), various tech stuff (setting up, etc), using all of the microsoft programs known to man, photo shop, adobe professional, watch repair, jewelry repair, sizing watches and said jewelry, some basic engraving on flat surfaces with a machine of course, deadline stuff, writing articles, etc...  Sounding pretty good right?  I decided to change my major to English and Humanities that way I can say I did something in college.  And I want to be a translator instead of a psychologist...  I uh think I might get a myspace account...of course I never update this one because I never time.  I hardly ever get online anymore and if I do, it's to write a paper and half the time I am not even online...  I actually don't even have time to eat or go to the bathroom sometimes...  I have become a bit of a drone.  All I do is school, work, work, relationship, sleep, then the same thing in a possibly different order.  So yea... but I need to go ahead and go because I have class now... So later everyone and I hope you're doing okay."

"event","well I have come to the conclusion that I have gone crazy (I'm thinking schizo or maybe just severely depressed) because here recently I have been seeing things in different colors.  Isn't there some psychological disease like that?  Like I'll just be sitting there and suddenly everything will be in a cool color mode (all blues, greens and purples) or I'll see everything in warm colors (just reds and oranges).  I also get to where everything is just sepia colored.  It sort of scares me...like I mean I haven't had any psychotic thoughts or anything.  The only person I wish an assload of harm to is someone I never see.  Maybe afterall these years my tormented  mind has finally snapped.  But I thought I would at least know it, I mean my thoughts have sort of become scrambled in the past few weeks.  God, this just adds to the stress I already have.  I've been getting super stressed over silly little things, I don't seem to be super violent either...  What do I do!?  I have been abused mentally, emotionally, physically and I am sure I've been abused in a few other ways as well.  I hate my mom anf my dad for being such assholes, my mom for beating me and dad for ignoring me.  I hate my drunken aunt for hating me for no reason and smacking whenever I looked at my sister the wrong way.  I hate having scars that run so deep, I fear everyone can see them.  I hate being weird, I hate that whore for taking the one thing that gave me hope even if she neglected me...  I have come to the realization that there is no such thing as love and happiness...only for people who have money, rich and or humble parents, and people who are a lot stronger than me and eventually stop being shit on by everyone.  I wouldn't bring a child into this world because I'm afraid of what would happen to them after I die, does that make sense?  I know I would be one super fucking parent; I'd never scream curse words or derogatory comments at them or hit them with my hands and other objects a drunken hand would grab...  Okay I need to just go ahead and stop...everything has become blue and green and purple...  I guess I'll go to sleep."

"event","So this waking up at the crack of dawn to leave Cricket's room is killing me!  ...She told me last night that A. (we will refer to the whore as A. now) had been in her room before I came over and they had kissed.  I was very upset and angry and we talked for a while about us and how she needed to make up her mind about who she was going to choose and about how it's funny A. is still living with her girlfriend and yadda yadda.  She said she didn't know if she was waiting for someone to choose for her; A. leaving her gf or me saying goodbye.  Well we ended up doing stuff that we weren't supposed to because we're serperated and it was sort of weird...  We talked about the different reasons why me and A. are different and this and that.  She says she doesn't know why she likes A. so much and I tried reasoning it was because we virtually have no friends outside each other and when A. became her friend and showed interest in her, it went to hell from there.  I told her that it was just an infatuation and that it was just physical (of course I don't see how but anyway).  We talked about how A. only initiated it with Cricket because A. was bored in her loveless relationship and how she would never be able to protect Cricket if something happened.  Cricket told me I made her feel safe and she slept better when I was near...  After uh doing things she said we could talk more about it tomorrow night (so I'm staying with her again tonight)and she stated she needed more time.  God why do human emotions have to be so complex.  I'm beginning to wonder if I should pull out while I'm still behind.  I almost wonder if I should say ""fuck you, you dirty whore.  Goodbye"" and walk out...but I'm not like that.  Instead I told her that it was odd I was beginning for her to take me back and she said she hadn't let me go...  I really can look past this whole thing and never talk of it again, but right now it's like a neverending battle.  I told her we could start over and do things differently and she could quit Things Remembered and go back to school with me.  She doesn't think the feelings would go away for her, but I tried reassuring her they would.  Why do I feel like I'm pleading my case with her?  She has to work with A. tonight and I wonder if she'll think of me at all in the time she'll be at work with bitchbag.  I seriously thought hard about what I am feeling for Cricket and our relationship and a) yes I can truly forgive her and trust her again (I am now!) b) she isn't my whole world, but I have made sure that my world accomodates her c) sex isn't a major reason why I love her, it's not even on my list of why I love her.  I just want someone to tell me it's gonna be okay, like the times before when we had to break up because of her parents.  I feel like I need to just put my foot down and tell her she needs to chose.  I hinted at it last night and told her that I was hurting and she needed to let me know where I stood.  She said she didn't want to talk about it, but I told her she needed to or else she wouldn't be able to decide.  Cricket thinks something is wrong because she wants both of us but she is in love with me.  I told her that it would be super fucking stupid to throw away our five year bond for a four day affair...  Will she come to her senses?  Will I be with her and end up happy?  Should I just drive my tank off the expressway?  Damn I hate having these stupid emotions!  GRAH!"

"event","Thanks for y'all's advice.  I have calmed down a bit, I'm still depressed and slightly psychotic...but hey I'm better than the past few days.  I uh...stayed the night with Cricket the past two nights...  It's sort of weird, me sneaking in through her window.  She has to work with bitchbag tonight and I'm not gonna lie about it but I am pissed/worried.  I told Cricket last night that even if she didn't choose me, I would have to respect her choice and I would at least want to be her friend.  I'm trying to not care anymore, but it's not working very well.  I wonder if she'll ask me to stay the night again tonight?  Like, I can totally look past the fact she cheated on me and is now trying to debate on who she loves, but I dunno...  I'm going to try and stay busy today so I'm going to apply at the Post Office (LOL!!) for casual help for the summer.  I refuse to listen to the radio or even MTV.  I finally got that Killers song out of my head (mr.brightside) and now I've got the stupid Rob Thomas song in my head...  It's funny how the songs about cheating were okay to listen to before, but when it happens you realize how truly sad the songs are.  Yea.  After all the little things that she does around me that everyone else says means she loves me and will pick me, I just try to remain pessimisic about it.  My luck is so bad that if I get my hopes up, it doesn't happen.  So even though she tells me she loves me, clings to me when we sleep and says she sleeps better and I make her feel safe, even though she woke me up this morning kissing me, pecks me on the lips before I go out of her window, and even when I talk in future tense and she doesn't correct me (only when I say girlfriend, then she reminds me of our seperation) or she talks in future tense, I will not get my hopes up.  I don't need another heartbreak...  Well I'm going to go ahead and try to do something productive to keep me busy."

We took my mom's friend to the hospital to get knee surgery, she has a brain tumor, and all sorts of other crap wrong with her.  ...but she is upbeat and cheery.  I like Kelly and I enjoy talking to her and today it actually hit me that she could die at anytime and anywhere.  Being in that rickety hospital in the small town (this was a small ass hospital too) made me think.  And the line of thinking that was storming in my brain made me depressed.  Then I got to thinking about me and Cricket and how we are becoming somewhat estranged...but not really.  After our adventure in Indiana with Kelly I came home and took a nap.  When I woke up, I just feel crappy and couldn't focus on anything.  I've been fine for a while now and today is just an odd day.  Tomorrow is my sister's prom and I am just now realizing she is becoming a young woman.  I feel so old...  But I'm only 20, I should be super energetic and shit right?

I don't feel like seeing Cricket this weekend...I feel like I need to distance myself being that I leave at the end of this month for the whole summer.  Now I am beginning to wonder if I'll like camp or not.  I haven't even got some of the stuff I need, but it's just little crap.  I wish it'd rain...rain always make me feel better sometimes.

So I spent the day loafing around gathering clothes for camp.  I found a bunch of my old t-shirts (cool ones I thought I had lost) and some more jeans (good thing because my whole two pair of jeans are getting 'vintage' holes)!  So I got that together and washed 'em.  I went through my little check list and tried to find the stuff I need to get.  I can't find my old glasses, so now I am paranoid I am gonna lose the ones I have now.  So...I am going to get a band to hold them on...IT'S SO EMBARASSING!  Or may I'll just leave 'em in a case back at my cabin and be blind as a fruit monkey with an eye patch.  Yea.  Not super exciting huh?  I took a break from the learn-it-yourself Japanese for now.  Instead I'm reading a psychology/sociology book on American teens and Japanese teens.  My mom decided to turn the air conditioners on, so that means it's officially summer in my household.  Quick question, does anyone else call air conditioning ""AC""?  I remember one time in elementary school I said it and some kid gave me the ol' what the blue friggin' fuck are you talking about look.  So I haven't said it since then, not even when writing.  No...I have strayed far from it.  My mom uses it, so maybe that's the other reason I stay away from that abbreviation.  I think I might get my gay man Damin to give me a massage since he's going to massage school and needs guinea pigs.  Cricket is going to get one next week, so maybe I'll see if he'll do me too.  Hm.  I guess I'll go ahead and play something online.  Later."

When I left I took in the beauty that is a expanse of darken light gray concrete and the smell of the asphalt that lingered in my nostrils...  Yea.  It was nice.  Nothing new to report.  I spent the majority of the day working, and tomorrow I am going to go to another mall (J-mall near my house) to return a shirt to get a better one or money for it.  I haven't decided yet, but I think I am leaning towards shirt.  I now bide my time until I get my anime fix.  I have recently discovered R.O.D.  It's pretty good.  I also like Stand Alone Complex and of course my favorite mangaka's anime, Inuyasha.  So like my nightly cartoon/anime fix is from 11pm-2pm.  Sad huh?  Oh well.  I think I'm gonna grab me a generic dr.pepper and relax.  Standing on your feet and running up and down a gigantic crickety ass ladder can wear on your knees.  I thought I was gonna die when the wooden ladder we have in the stock room made a not good creaking sound.  All right...nighty night."

It turns out that the physiological class before ours had decided to take their exam during the time we usually had the class.  Our professor was hella pissed.  She was like yelling at their professor and stuff, it was awesome!  So I took my last final today and a little bit of a weight has been lifted off my chest.    It will all go away when she posts my final grade.  If I could at least make an 80 on the final, I'll get a 70 for the class.  Whoo!  I passed my other classes with two A's and a C!  Yoush!  I am very happy about that.  I feel sort of tired and some various other moods.  I hope Cricket's night is a little better, today was her birthday and she was super tired and depressed.  I am still steadily losing weight and my clothes are becoming huge, so yay for me suddenly becoming a mindless sheep!  Tomorrow I gotta go to work (I am still at Things Remembered, I'm their bitch) from 9am-6:30pm.  Then I gotta cut the grass and then pass out from exhaustion.  Oh, my cat is in heat and it is so friggin funny.  She has been making sharp trill sounds and keeps rubbing her face on my feet or laying in the floor wallowing around.  It is so damn cute.  Camp is coming up soon...I am so happy!  Oh, if I don't write for two months, it's because I am away!!!!  I think I might keep a journal, since I have one that I occasionally use for cool ideas.  It's weird.  OH OH OH!!  Cricket dyed my hair because she wanted to and she even cut an inch off.  It is now a cool looking black cherry color...or maybe it's a mahogony color?  Teh b0X0r said ""Caramel Chocolate"".  I think it's red.  Oh well, it apparently looks pretty good on me.  Hm...I think I am going to practice my Japanese a while then pass out or sumting.  Jah...

I am praying so friggin' hard to pass all three of my finals...but now I sort of don't care because if I was going to fail they'd have notified me about being a fucktard.  I can't wait to start working so I can at least get some of my credit cards paid off and crap.  I hope when I come back I'll be able to do some work study or something.  I have to go see Cricket tonight at work.  We had another ""She's going crayz and feels depressed and feels like she's missing out on something important in life"" bull crap last night.  I finally was just like, ""Look...if we ever break up, it's because of your doing.""  A friend of mine said that was harsh, but I didn't say it to be harsh and I said it in a ""my heart is being ripped out my chest again because for some reason I only love you and am eternally your slave"" tone.  Gah...  It'll all work out.  Damn...  Oh yea, I went to sign up at Bellarmine finally and it took me about 45 minutes (10 minutes was spent trying to find another place across the street to park, talking to a catholic priest, and finally asking the nice people at some random building associated w/the school where the registrar's office was) of driving around the fucking college on huge hill until I literally screamed obscenities at myself in my car and parked in a handicapped spot in front (with out a sticker bitch!).  Then I hike up the stairs that normally lead to the tibetian temple in movies but instead a university with crosses all over it and have to hike up more stairs when I get inside the freaking building.  After finally getting to the registrar's office I gave the lady my metroversity form and said I was from the university of Louisville and wanted to take Japanese.  She didn't even look at me or the paper and said that I couldn't register until the 15th of August.  Before I could respond/protest or even ask a question she turned around and went back to chatting with some fat kid behind the counter.  I had called them before and they said to come in and register and even my advisor said to hurry up and go over there to make sure I got into the class.  So I stood there for five more minutes and she didn't even pay me any mind, so I said in a loud cheery voice for all to hear, ""Thanks ya fucking bitch!""  I hate people.  I am going to go and find something productive to do.  Later."

We went to hang out at a friends house with our gay man, and we watched the events on TV because it was waaaaaaaaaay to freaking cold to go down near the river front.  It was during this time I learned that if you mix malibu pineapple rum, pineappled juice, oranges and bananas together in a blender, if tastes super good.  I even made up a name because we couldn't remember if this type of concoction had a name.  So we dubbed it ""Kendra's Kablasterfucker"".  Cool huh?!  I went and saw that damn play for school finally and it was awesome!  I really enjoyed it.  It was hilarious.  It was called All in the Timing if anyone wants to try and see it or read it.  I also found out that I am losing weight pretty steadily and that got me all happy.  So yea for me!  Squats, push ups and sit ups kick hella ass.  If you're wondering what my titles mean, this one means ""I'm thirsty"" in Nihongo.

Maybe I could go to Bellarmine after my noon class...but I need to study for my final in Geoscience...HMMM.  I think I'll try after my exam.  Let's see...I need to just go over my exam notes then print out a review for my sociology exam next tuesday night...

I remembered this one time I fell off a trailer bed onto the ground and got the wind knocked out of me.  Then my friend jumped off too to make me feel better.  So then we both just started jumping off of it (it was like two feet off the ground) and landing on our stomachs.  It was so weird.  I also used to jump off this shed we had in my backyard.  It was like six friggin feet tall, and I'm leaping around like spider-girl.  I even used to jump off our deck on the back porch (we talking seven feet and I was six years old).  I think I know why my knees are so fucked up, lol.  So my memories snuck up on me out of nowhere, hence the title.  I like MSI, they're a fucked up and funny ass band.

But anyway, we were talking about how things have grown either quickly or slowly through out time.  It was then I realized that as humans we only live a maxium of 80 years; we don't see how society changes over the centuries.  I mean they do, but not completely.  We only get to see little bits of evolution, and we create offspring to carry on our genes so that they too can see little bits of evolution.  Okay so that was a stupid observation.

I had to go to the registrar's office, financial aide (that's how it's spelled on the sign), arts and sciences building (had be to advised but they suck ass).

I miss not having her with me every second of the day when we get off work and school.  I have to go see a play this week so maybe I'll take her out to see it.  Her grandpa isn't doing any better, so I'm worried about her being worried.  It's weird how when you love someone so much that you worry about them all the time and have those awkward 'no after you' moments.  It's also hard when she is always being pulled in a million different directions and then I try not to ask her to commit to a lot of things or ask her to do stuff.  I try not to expect her to do anything, so I try to just be there for her and let her do what she wants.  Things are a little different than they were before.  We have this connection that is stronger than before and although she can still wear on me when she gets stressed I love her even more.  I always forget about everyone hating gays when I am with her.  It's odd sometimes.  People say our love is wrong but when we're together it feels so right...okay enough of the cheesy crap, sorry.  I have to do so much crap this week.  I want to see Amityville Horror.  I am excited about camp and I have been trying so damn hard to look semi-toned.  I have to wear a bathing suit and I am so dreading that.  I guess I would need to get a little tan so that I'm not so white.

I am just waiting for Cricket to get online so I can instant message her to death.  I thought of a new activity to add to my list of things to do and that is definately save the money to go to my anime convention this year!  I want to go to Sugoicon, but if I save enough I can go to a bigger one out of state.  I might try to get a job with the GSA if summer camp goes well.  Gah.  My sister was at a friends and they were having a yard sale and she got upset because no one was buying her originally $30 pants for $6-10, so she started selling them for $1 and my mom had to yell at her.  It was one of those you had to be there moments.  =)  I need to get my final crown put on Tuesday, fun.  Crap, I think I am going to actually have a full week this week, what with reviews for finals and stuff.  I am actually studying for my sociology final.  I can do it!  I wonder when I can see Cricket again...  I finally am going to get caught up on the L word tomorrow at some little party tomorrow.  I saw the first three episodes and then stuff started happening and I didn't want to watch it if I had missed an episode.  So tomorrow I get caught up, whoo hoo!  I also need to see when Dallas season 3 comes out.  I lurv me some Dallas, so don't laugh or you shall die a horrible horrible death...=p!!  Yep.  I went to the flea market today with Cricket and I just love Kentucky even more sometimes.  Walking through it seeing all the crap people try to make $2.50 off of.  Or seeing people's little handy crafts and such.  One booth disappointed me, they printed out little signs (with no nifty fonts or images) and put them in cheap dollar store frames.  It was sort of sad.  But I love looking at all the old paintings and comic books and clothes and toys that children once loved.  I saw a kick ass sword in one booth and asked the lady at the front register (the booth was behind the cashier) if I could look at the sword and she was literally like, ""Yup.""  So I look at her for a second and said, ""Okay let me be more clear.  Could you please open the case so that I can see this sword?""  She looked at me again.  So losing my patience asked in a calmly strained manner, ""May I open the cabinet to look at the sword?""  Then being the lazy hobag she was she then proceeded to tell that she couldn't walk over to the booth, two feet from the counter, where me and my girlfriend were the only people there, and open the cabinet so I could look at the sword for two seconds to see if I would like to give her $20 for it.  Not to mention she even had all the keys to every booth behind the counter and could of let me open it myself and watch me the whole time.  If I really wanted to take something I would have and laughed.  So instead I shook my head and made my way past the 'git-r-done' hats and followed Cricket to some figurines of snowmen humping snowballs and me commenting on that's how snow men were made.  So that was my interesting morning!  I am gonna go play outside in traffic or something.  Later.  Oh...I'm still in a good mood too, ^________^."

1.  Save money to go to Japan!
2.  Win lottery.
3.  Win money off a radio show.
4.  Watch tons of new anime!
5.  Play some new video games.
6.  Switch to Tofu.
7.  Read some new books.
8.  Do some charity work.
9.  Write a sceenplay and a rough draft of a novel.
10. Do art; sketch on everything, because the world is my canvas.
11. Take over the world and have Harajuku chicks follow me around as groupies.
12. Become a DJ in Japan and do mad crazy shows in the middle of the street.
13. Learn Ninjutsu and use it on my enemies...or to get free stuff.
14. Graduate from college and get a spiffy job that makes me happy.
15. Get a house that has an upstairs, downstairs, basement, and an attic with stairs leading up to it in a closet (c'mon living in a one floor sucks ass!!).
16. Become a teacher in Japan for a while.
17. Become a substitute teacher for a while in America.
18. Visit Ireland because it is my homeland...or well something like that.
19. Make a comic book.
20. Just be happy...

Yea, so this is a craptacular list, but I figured what the hell.  Some of it are actual goals I want to try and eventually achieve...we'll see, ne?  Well that's all for me folks!"

Damn them and their attempts to get my money!  And some other stuff happened but I am pretty calm now and feeling jaded about the situation.  Grah!!!  My mom is driving me crazy.  GEEZ.  I tell her I'll get something and she just keeps on nagging and doing the chore she asked me to do.  So I just argue with her and try to keep what little temper I have with her in check.  Anyway...I am gonna get off this thing for night.  Later."

I am currently waiting for 3:30pm to roll around so I can head out to school a little early and print ou tmy extra credit for sociology.  I think I am going to do craptacular in that class, but oh well.  *Sigh* maybe I'll update later and let you voyeurs know how I am doing.  So I am out and over...yea.  Whatevah."

"event","Hello again people.  Today I went to one class, my English class.  I had a seven page rhetorical analysis due and I did it this morning at 2am.  And everyone in class was amazed by my paper and by the fact I hadn't even read the book.  My day was fairly boring, cutting the grass, playing Mortal Kombat and laughing at the cheesy dialogue, and I typed another paper in about 5 minutes to get me some extra credit in sociology (I hope).  If I actually attended my classes I would probably be making all A's, but I am a slacker so I hardly ever go to my classes.  It is very sad.  Yea...  I think I am going to try to take a crap load of classes next semester so I can get enough hours to be a substitute teacher.  That way I will never be without a job, right?  *Sigh*  I feel like doing something creative or something.  No, I think I just want to play that damn game.  I lost my tax papers and had to call the IRS like a million times today.  And each time I called their system was down, and I'm like ""Uh...but you're the IRS?""  Finally I managed to get through when their system was working and requested a Form Letter 1722 (sounds offical huh?) so I can get my financial aid, yay!  They give me money to go to school and it's pretty awesome.  I use it for books and crap.  Maybe I can get another work study job or something.  ...I hope I still get paid to go to school, my GPA won't be very good this year.  Oh well, let's hope.  I'm lucky because my mom doesn't get any income and my dad doesn't either.  LOL, okay so maybe I'm not lucky.  But hey it's better to hear me being slightly cheerful, right?  I am still trying to think of what classes I am going to take next semester.  I think I am going to take some bullshit classes to bring my GPA back up (it's like a 2.1-5 right now).  Gah.  I wonder how my cat Marie is doing in her new home... *sad face*  At least I have Mishka and Nemo.  They love me enough.  I told my mom I wanted to be a DJ for a local strip club and she said no.  I was like, damn.  I think it would be fun to be a DJ, it is not like I am stripping. Okay I am just rambling so I'll cut this off here and finish talking to my girlfriend."

"event","So yea, I have a seven page rhetorical analysis to write on a book I never read and use Oh Kentucky and a random Harlequin Indian Romance as ways to compare stereotypes and race issues used in romance novels.  It is due tomorrow!  Think I can crank out seven pages of pure bull shit to save my sorry ass?  Hell yeah I can!  Now if only I can quit playing my sisters Xbox with the new Mortal Kombat game (they killed off all the old characters, good thing I love Scorpion and Sub-Zero).  I feel old playing this new game because I was all like ""where's Liu Kang?  Where the hell is Raiden?!""  I quit playing the game after they made mortal kombat 3- back when it was still on Sega Genesis!  I beat Shenmue 2 yesterday and I was pissed because it was another open ending!  I was like all that work for that!?  Yep.  *ahem* Back to me writing my paper and other stuff.  Or not.  I finally got to see Meet the Fockers, and it was actually pretty funny.  But the Village 8 theater is really crappy and small. It smelled like poo.  When I was little I remember it being fairly big.  But I give the theater credit because they hire alot of special needs people and we all know how pissed off I get when people are mean/rip off/taunt/bully/give them grunt work/talk down to handicapped people.  Yup.  My gf got to stay the night with me and I have never slept better. It's weird how big the bed feels, or couch in my case, when you're in it alone and have been sharing it with someone for like evah.  Actually I asked her to stay the night because I wanted to sleep in my mom's bed and couldn't sleep on the couch, it's hurting my back.  If you thinking 'hey get in your own damned bed' well I can't because my mom moved my cousin in and he pays her $200 a month to steal my bedroom.  So I camp out on the couch while everyone including my cats get to sleep on beds.  It's okay, when I go to camp I'm going to be like one of those crazy mad survivalists!  I'm gonna be all like 'I slept on a couch for two months!  This ain't pain! Now hike up the trail ladies, let go'.  Yea...Or not.  I am such a dork.  I feel like I am writing the first random thoughts popping into my head- which I need to save for my paper.  So I am going to go play me some Mortal Kombat (after I get the codes, fuck the actual work!) and think of ways to bullshit my way through this one."

"event","So I went to see Sin City today.  It was hella cool.  I liked it because it actually seemed to stick with the comic book's plot.  It was a better comic to movie adaption that's for sure...okay so I just loved how they portrayed Miho! She was my favorite character in the comic and she rocked in the movie.  But yea...it's been an okay day.  My mom is mad at me, I ran around outside trying to reaquaintance myself with skateboarding, then decided to jog around and play basketball, all in all it's been a fairly normal day.  I think I am going to look into finding a kendo club or some martial art at school so I have something to do.  But that would be kind of stupid because I am going away for two months and it might be too late to join a club or something at school.  Maybe I'll just make up some crap and whip my wooden bokken around and try to be a l33+ ninja master with it.  I want to see some other movies that are coming out too, like the Amityville Horror (I liked the original) and uh The Devil's Rejects.  Oh GEEZ...they re-did the Honeymooners with Cedric the entertainer and his not so famous friend who isn't funny.  I was like 'what the fuck!?' in front of some teenagers and they were like 'oh that looks tight'.  I told them they were morons and that it's a sad day when they redo a white people comedy into an all black cast.  That would be like making a white version of the Jeffersons!  What the hell is the world coming too?!  And I swear I am not racist so don't even try it.  Movie theaters are getting screwed up as well.  I couldn't buy my mom and my sister's tickets to go see Sin City with me because I am not yet 21.  I looked at the lady and laughed in her face all maniacally and said 'Welp.  Guess I gotta go get my mommy then'.  I was in a really weird mood earlier.  Yes.  Well I'm off to do some mad stretchs and then to bed!"

"event","Holy butter tastin' buttermilk pancakes Batman!  I have not updated in friggin forevah!  I was reminiscing with an old internet buddy who I have still managed to talk to for about six years now and I realized 'hey!  Xav knows I am crazy and he still talks to me... weird.'  So I decided to update and maybe possibly try to start updating this damned thing again.  Things have looked up for me these past two years.  My life still sucks undoubtedly, but whose doesn't?  I miss all my friends from back in the day.  I miss the simplicity of going to a set schedule and grooling away over crap we'll never use again in our lives.  College is going okay for me, I am trying to make it through as quickly as I can.  I want to be an art therapist or something similar.  If that fails, I want to be a teacher in Japan.  It's sort of odd how I have finally somewhat settled in my Taoist take on life and trying to just move through life as it hurls itself at me.  I am a bit more calm, but as my father constantly tells me, ""you have so much hate in you.""  Well, that hate is something that will never possibly die, because it is me.  It makes me, fuels me, and it is the basis for how react to things.  I guess that doesn't make sense, but I'm just trying to say that I am a bit more sane now.  I am still with my girlfriend of what like 3 years?  We're happy and stressed and constantly bickering, but our love isn't viewed as normal by everyone else so of course it causes a bit of strife, right?  I have had one hell of a ride in my life and there's still more to come, so I can't believe that at one time I was ready to give up on it so easily.  GEEZ, okay sorry this is starting to sound like a damn school special or whatever.  But to make a long story short, I am here to bug the hell out of all you and make some money in the process and to raise a semi-normal family in the process!  HA!  So there!  Before I leave this random rant of updatedness (I just made that up, cool huh?) I just want to say a few things and see if the corresponding people acknowledge me or you know, whatever.  To Vina:  Hey, you still alive and running around out there making mad crazy art?  I hope all is going well for you.  To Gillian: Thanks for making my last year of high school bearable.  I'm sorry we're not friends now, because at least now I'm more crazy enough to do shit and not care so much.  To Melissa:  Sorry for treating you so shitty when I really wanted to have a friend who liked the things I did.  I hope you make it big as an artist.  To Jesse:  Thanks for being that token sexy cool-haired guy friend who made my last year of high school bearable, and for the Hunter plaque.  To Xavier:  For starting out as the friend of a boy friend and ending up being my favoritest person over Justin.  Thanks for being my ""brother"".  To my peoples in Florida (Disney):  You all rocked!  You made me feel home even though my home was far away up north.  Thanks to anyone else who has met me in my life, you have more than likely helped me realize something or helping me become a better person.   Well I think that's all for my cheesy ass thank you's, tomorrow I will be back bitching and thrashing anything and everything!  G'night folks!"

I HAVE A JOB!  HA!  I am going to fling myself into work and work until I fucking pass out, then keep on working.  I am so friggin happy to have an excuse to be out of this smoke infested hell hole.  I'll now have money to save so that I may one day get a car that actually runs!  Let's hope things keep going my way.  I put in the application, went home to be bitched at, the boss called, I went up there in like 5 minutes, and got hired, then even had time to do the stupid piss test for drugs (the place closed at 5 but I got there at 4:45!) and I had just enough pee to make it!  YAH!

"event","I am tired of living in a delusional existence where every moment for me is filled with doubt and depression.  For example, I'm not going to enter a comic book contest because my girlfriend thinks I should be doing other things like the fucking slave I am.  I swear she's a fucking nazi and everything is beginning to boil down to the point where I am going to tell her to fuck off.  She is my first love, so yea I have first fuck syndrome (where you're hung up on- it's self explanatory).  I can't take this anymore, I have no job, can't go to school next semester, and I can no longer receive conseling from school.  DAMMIT I only went once!  I fucking hate my luck.  I am not happy in this stupid fucking existence, I'm sorry everyone has to read all about me whining, but y'know what?  I have no one else to listen to me.  I mean, I'm sure I could find someone, but about a second into the conversation the conversation would switch to their problems and how they have it so hard.  My mom says she worried about me and blah blah, she's just doped up on pain killers.  'Sides my little sister babbling 'bout her ""fight"" with some stupid fucking boy is more important.  I am thinking about packing my shit and just leaving...I don't know where I'd go, but I'd go somewhere.  I think I want to go back to Florida.  At least at Disney I can have a secure fucking job!!!  I think I'm gonna stop writing in here too...  I'm no one reads this crap (or cares for that matter) and writing in this thing doesn't help me as much as it used to...  I don't know.  Maybe I will, Maybe I won't...  I know that I want to find someone to love me for me and everything stupid thing I like (or at least someone to respect that).  Should I break up with her?  Should I try talking to her so things are okay for a day or two?  Should I jump off the bridge?"

But...on the plus side I think my T.A. likes me or she's just really super duper nice.  I turned in a crappy ass frantic abstract to her and I did it completely wrong, but she said she really liked it and went ahead and gave me full credit for it.  One day we had a small discussion about how we went to the same highschool and some other things we liked/stuff and one time I talked to her about pronouncing the Japanese words correctly (we have them in like half of our texts and books, the Japanese are a collectivist culture and they are usually prime examples for psychology).  I would like to have someone to talk to about things because we seemed to have alot in common.  Actually I think because of my domineering girlfriend who I can't help but love, I am afraid to make friends with her (or the countlessly other cute girls that talk to me) because my girlfriend freaks out on me.  She accuses me of cheating and says I am oblivious to when people have crushes on me.  I dunno.  I just...geez I am sounding pretty stupid but...  I'm sorry if there's anyone I made mad at me (*coughGilliumcough*), things are just sort of fucked up for me right now.  I guess I'll be debating on whether or not to try and see if my TA would want to hang out with me...  And sorry for all the people struggling to get through my worst entry that sounds like a after-school special.  Later people."

"event","Classical music can be the most awesome thing ever.  It is haunting yet inticing.  You can almost feel the music inside of you.  I actually love music and if I had the money I'd love to learn to play various instruments.  I love listening to Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, everything!  I prefer the darker sort of ""hard core"" classical (like Bach, all organs and such...).  Lately my depression has become so bad that it is beginning to alarm me.  I have started to see a conselor at school.  When I did my interview (where they determine if you need short or long term therapy), the woman was surprised by me.  I scored a 40 (anything over is suicidal maniac) on a aptitude test and she said she my outward demeanor was very different from my test results.  She said, ""You are very well disciplined and clearly intelligent.  You are very calm and obviously sane mentally, I can tell by your responses...""  I sort of felt like Dr. Lector, inside I was screaming to tear the room apart to unleash every weight and burden that suffocates me.  But I calmly answered all of her questions and only sort of brokedown once.  I have cried 'til I can no longer cry.  I have become emotionless again, save for when I am alone in my room.  My conselor is going to make me retake the test because she said my score means that I should be rushed to the hospital, and she feels I made a mistake.  I made no mistakes, I was unfortunately honest.  I think about suicide all the time, but I am too scared to commit such an act, and I know it would be hard on my little sister and my girlfriend.  At least I pretend to think that way.  My cat, Sushi ran away the other night and that has depressed me even more.  I hope I can keep up my guise a little longer...  I need to find a job to throw myself into.  Did I mention I probably won't be going to college next semester because I still owe $666 dollars.  I don't have the money, my mom was supposed to take care of it in fall 2002.  She applied for welfare a few days ago.  I can't take this much longer...  I feel like everything is going to crap...  I am having problems making decesions and I can't think straight anymore.  I am trying to do fencing, yoga, anything that's physical and requires me to focus on the things on hand instead of mentally.  I hate my life, when I think will go no lower, they do.  I'm so fucking sick of myself and my existence.  I don't have anyone to talk to, and it frustrates me!  I can't tell people certain things because they'll criticize me for it.  The only reason I unleash my frustrations here occasionally is because I don't give a fuck as to what a stranger has to say to me.  I mean, I am used to being criticized, screamed, cursed at, and generally hated, but it is worse when it comes from someone you try to love but they don't care (i.e. my mom, my girlfriend, my FUCKING BASTARD FATHER!...)  Why can't I be one of the happy people for once...I didn't even get to go to my one thing this year!  I didn't get to go to my anime convention!  I hate everything...  I think I am going to go surf online for awhile...  I need to stop before I cry...at least I think I am going to cry...I don't know, I feel so out of control of everything...even myself..."

"event","good morning!!!  i'm so proud of myself.  i didn't have to work early today, but i still wanted to get up kinda early, so i set an alarm to get up at 9:30 and believe it or not, i was actually awake before that!  :)

i really don't have a lot to do today...finish putting away laundry, read, watch the last samurai before it goes back to the video store...yeah i think that's it.  then work at 2, yay.

okay this is kinda cool:

last night a friend and i decided to go up to this club just to dance, for old times' sake.  turns out we couldn't go to the club, since they changed the rules for thursday nights and you had to be under 21, otherwise you had to go to the bars downstairs.  we ended up leaving and going to stroudsburg, (the town we used to hang out a lot in) and went to this place called front row.  they have a sports bar type area and then a more restaurant-ish area.  my friend got a beer (eh) and i, water, and we just sat and talked.  we saw a few people from high school, but spent most of the time just chillin in a booth.  i was a little nervous on our way there b/c in the past, i was very easily tempted to drink.  it's not something i'm at all proud of, but we all make our mistakes and i've turned away from it and am learning from my errors.  :)  anyway, much to my surprise, it was SO easy not to drink.  and in looking around...there are so many badly dressed people in this world.  leave a little to the imagination already!!!

even though i found it very easy to not drink, i wasn't to thrilled to be there.  so it's possible to go out and not drink...but really, the atmosphere sucks.  *shrug*  i'd much rather corny, clean fun.

ciao."

"event","worked from 6am-2.  and i haven't taken a nap, i'm so proud of myself!!  i think someone knew that i needed to practice getting up earlier, hahaha.  as crazy as it sounds, i wish that i opened again tomorrow and saturday instead of starting at 2.  oh well..

i'm going to palmyra a week from today!  whoo hoo!!  i LOVE the hill cumorah pageant.  anyone that hasn't seen it, you're missing out.  it's amazing.  not to mention all the cool stuff there is there besides the hill...the joseph smith farm, the sacred grove, the town itself...there's the intersection w/ a different church on each corner, an awesome bookstore...it's great.  :)  not that i'm excited or anything!

man i wish i was going to utah this summer.  on the 14th i'll be headed down to florida, that'll be fun, but, i don't know.  i really miss utah.  and not entirely because of mike, either!  it's just such a different atmosphere, i love it.

this is kinda random, but i'm quite satisfied with this lj username.  it took me forever to pick one...i wanted a happier, more uplifting name than my other one.  i'm really, really picky about this kind of stuff, don't ask me why.  i settled on this one because it reminds me that i (just like all of you) am of divine birth, a daughter of my Heavenly Father that loves me.  and it makes me happy, because even if no one on this earth will love me, He always will.  and that's awesome."

"event","so i'm reading ""a marvelous work and a wonder.""  it's awesome.  i started it saturday night and i'm only about halfway through it.  my dad was making fun of me b/c i normally read faster than that, but it's some heavy stuff!!

the goal is to read all of the books in the ""missionary reference library"" before i turn my papers in.  i also have a scripture study program w/ the bishop that i need to finish beforehand also.  i have this sudden spiritual energy that i haven't felt in soooooo long.  i forgot how rewarding living the gospel can be.

eh, i have work at 6am again tomorrow.  but it's payday!  whoo hoo!  i'm so broke...so there's also the thing about saving up before i turn my papers in too.  oh how i <i>abhor</i> money.

hmm, i think i'm going go read some more.  and then go to bed...i've been up since 5am.  craziness."

"event","hey guys! Alright, first of all, west fest. it was fun and I woulda had a good night, except I got drunk and I was with mervin. we talked and went for a walk with steph and lindsay and everything seemed so normal, then we drive to my place and i talked to dan about everything, im balling my eyes out, I come inside, mervins fuckin trashed... so i bring him to the bathroom to puke, i bring him on the couch and let him sleep. well this morning I woke up in my moms bed but he was spooning me, so i was like wtf? I guess he was trying to wake me up, but I cant shake him! I know there's a way, but it's so hard to do everything right all the time. Im talking to chad on msn right now, have been for a couple hours, and he asked me how many guys ive had sex with... who they were.. he already knew about kevin, and then he asked what I would call ""us""... so I was a little confused, like what am i supposed to say... and hes like ""verge of being bf gf...or?"" so I was like.. ummm i dont know.. i dont think anything could happen cuz of the distance... then he was like ""well do we not date anyone else through out the school year?"" wtf do i say to that. so i just said.. too hard to look ahead right now... and hes telling me how much he likes me and AHHH why cant i get away from this stuff.. I mean I like him, but things are getting way too serious for my liking..  i dont know what to do, but i should get some sleep."

"event","(Last night) Hey! I tried sleeping but I cant.. I cant stop thinking about what my brother said! He wont just let it go. I talked to jenn an hour ago and she just told me that i had to realize she wasnt the one standing between us and we need to settle our own differences... w/e i guess its true but the things he tells me piss me off! How am I a whore? like there are 4 guys that I've done shit with and thats chad, merv, kevin and jer. Two of them I only made out with... oh yeah and Ian but that was a one night mistake when I was younger. Kevin was not my fault and Merv, we went out for 2 years on and off.. how does that make me a whore? I dont jump every guy I fuckin see! uhh well I have to go back tomorrow to see them and Im not really looking forward to it. worse gets to worse i'll go stay at someones place for the night or till my mom gets off work. Well I think me and my cousin are gonna try to get some sleep so Im gonna stop venting about this. Have a good night !

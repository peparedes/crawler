Craig came home from work today.. today was day 3 from work. After dinner, we went over to see how the house is coming along.. they started painting today.. they should be done painting either tomorrow or the day after. Carpeting however, we're going to have to wait til the week of 4th of July. I'm exicted about seeing how everything is going to look.

After we got back from looking at the house.. Craig laid in my lap while I sat on the couch and read.. I rubbed his hand with my free hand. I thought he was just hugging on me watching sports. But, I looked down, and he was passed out. He looked so precious, I didn't want to move.. just enjoy the moment.. but pregnant bladder took over, and I had to get him off of me.. or pee on him. He's up stairs now passed out. That was thrity min ago.. it's now 9pm. I think he's exhausted from work and getting up so early. 

Elizabeth.. I'm sorry I didn't call back. That stupid interview took 45 min, and it completely slipped my mind until I saw your livejournal update. P Diddy? Holy fuck that's awesome!! P.Diddy having a residence in Habersham is just awesome. Haha, I'm sure that wouldn't last too long.. he'd either get shot by the kkk or die of bordem. But, if for some unknown reason he buys the house.. I think a pack of black n milds would be a nice house warming gift... only if he'll let you smoke one with him on the back porch!"

"event","<P>okay, so today was the coolest thing ever. I already sound like a Mom saying this.. but we went to the doctor today.. and got the ultrasound.. and heard the baby's heart for the first time. Craig and I both were grinning ear to ear.. watching the kid.. (we have nicknamed the baby meatball... and refer to it as meatball when we're talking about the baby). When I heard it's heartbeat for the first time.. I teared up. They had a hard time getting a heartbeat.. not because it wasn't strong.. but because Meatball.. couldn't sit still for more than 5 seconds. The kid was jumping.. and I'm not over doing it either.. the kid would push off with its feet... and bang its head into the top part of it's home (aka my uterus). It just kept doing it over and over again.. it was funny.</P>
<P>I also found out I'm further along than thought.. I'm due December 11th now... I thought I was 13 weeks, but I'm actually 14 weeks and a couple days.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We got a video of the baby... and I'm sure if I see you sometime.. I'll make you watch it. It's only about 3-4 min long. We also got some pictures... that of which I'm going to try to post up here, but also give you a link to the pictures incase I can't get them to post. </P>
<P>Our pictures are a lot clearer, but when I tried to download them to the computer.. it didn't come out so good... it's a little blurry but you can make out everything..</P>
<P>Yeah, I'm a dork.. but oh well. These pictures are mainly for Beth L.. who wanted me to send her a copy.</P>
<P>This pictcture looks like an alien.. but you can actually see the two hemispheres of the brain because the skin is so transparent. The baby is looking at the camera head on. (the head is on your left side)</P>

<P>I was in atlanta this weekend with craig's family. We went to a A's-Braves game Sunday... and it was great. Craig and I finally saw an A's game that ended in a big V (for victory).</P>
<P>We started painting the house (we might live in). And Craig now never to be allowed a paint brush or paint again. I didn't think someone could actually screw up painting a wall... but alas, he has done it. And now, we have to hire someone to fix the disaster. you may think that it can't be that bad.. I didn't think it could... but trust me... It's horrible.</P>
<P>My second doctors appointment is tomorrow at 2:30. Maybe (hopefully), we'll get an ultrasound and get to hear the baby's heart this time around. I'm 13 weeks pregnant this week... if you were curious. Some people say week 13 is the beginning of the 2nd trimester.. others say 14.. so I'm just going with 14 to be safe.</P>
<P>Anyway, I told beth about this website I always looked at.. and it's kinda funny.. the tips for dad is, anyway. The rest of it tells you what's developing in the baby, which is really neat.

It would be possible now to determine the baby's sex by looking at the genitals if we could only get close enough. (We usually can't ""guess"" via ultrasound until around the 16th week.)

Well, if you haven't heard from me much or seen me out.. it might be because I'm living in Huntsville now... and am 3 months pregnant. 

Yep, I said pregnant. Cross my heart stick a needle in my eye.

So, I just thought I'd get that out there... and now maybe you understand why I haven't been updating my lj. But, from now on I will.

Pick your jaw off the floor now... and feel free to tell whoever.. because I know it's probably going to be good gossip for awhile."

"event","I cried last night... because it was the last night I would spend at home... living here. Yeah, I'll come back for a visit now and agian, but it won't be the same. 

I've been packing all day... I shouldn't have procrastonated all week and shouldn't have put packing off like I have. It'll take me a trip or two to get everything completely out. 

I've said goodbye to the people I'm closest to. Everyone else, it's just too weird. Over the last couple of weeks... I've grown into a different person. My priorites have changed majorly... and my views on people have cleared up incredibly. 

Drinking and what I'm going to do 'tonight' are now completely ridiclious to me. I've discovered there's much much more. People who are completely self-focused and are only focused on their life dramas... ie... which boy doens't like me... or whoa's me... I have to have a boys attention to feel complete... I've found myself caring for them less and less. In reality, they don't give a damn what I'm going through... it's just more gossip for them to share to anyone who will listen. So I act civil, and really don't give a shit about their stupid dramas in which they think the world should stop for.

They may think that I've been acting weird lately... well, they're right. So, they don't do anything.. don't acknowledge anything. Which pisses me off some, becaue I've called to check up on them when they were going through something in life. Once again, they only really care about themselves... and I'm done with those people. 
 
And I don't care about pissing people off anymore. I really don't. 


I've realized I'm gonig to miss my family terribly... my first family and my second, the lafonds. Beth, you've been and are the greatest friend anyone could ask for. I love you with all my heart... and I mean it when I say that all I want for you to be is competley happy. 

Courtney, you're amazing. My internet friend... we've barely hung out, but over the last year or two, have chatted about almost everything. You rock. And you made my day when you told me you would buy me candy cigs and nonalcoholic beer anytime.. even 3am.  

So, I'm off.. on a new life adventure... and I have no idea what to expect. Everything around me is changing.. and if you know me, I like a plan.. and not a lot of change... but I'm realizing I'm just going to have to adjust. 

Anyway, anyone else out there... I love you all. This isn't my goodbye to Lj.. but to the Sham. 

While I can't wait to get the fuck out of here, I'm going to miss the memories I'm leaving behind."

I have my last final tomorrow.. well, today. Thank god, I'm just ready to be done with school for now. After my final... off to the mall to buy a dress for Craig's graduation. Do I really need to do this, probably not... but I want to. 

Tried to sell my books back yesterday... I walked in the library with an arm full.. only to be greeted by a line 45 deep. I said 'fuck it' aloud and left with my books. I'll give it another shot today. 

I'm leaving for Tuscaloosa whenever I wake up Friday... I'll be gone a couple of days. Should be an interesting weekend. Haha, really interesting. I'll have to tell you why later. 

Anyway, I think I'm going to go and try to pass out again... I've been playing bejewled for the last hour or so... and it's worn me out."

Elixabeth Grizzard (noticed I spelled your name with X... haha) update... tell me what's going on with you... even if it is boring... Brandon Costerison, please update. And, Courtney Irvin... start another journal.. I miss yours dearly. 

So, since I'm here... I might as well update

I have been a big ball of nothing today... nothing. I went to class, took my test and came home and passed out until 4 this afternoon. The only reason I woke up, Craig called me.

I'm really hating Sharkys now... bad. Thank God I only have a little while longer to work there. 

See, we have the 'regulars'... but our regulars are super regulars... they are there every fucking night.  I don't think these people would know what to do with their lives if Sharkys closed. It's sad, yet entertaining. I know them all by name, what beer they like to drink, who they're dating, and how many times they've been married.

I look at these people... and I've set the bar high for myself... I will never be a regualr anywhere, unless it's an expensive restraunt or one of the following... burberry, tiffanys, or delta. And even then, I will not be a super regular.

If anyone knows me years from now, and I am a super regular at a crappy sports bar with a korean boss/owner, you have my permission to put gum in my hair everytime you see me."

Ever noticed that?

I went there today for lunch today. When I paid for my meal, I said 'thanks' as she handed it over to me... her response, ""my pleasure."" I just kind of looked at her and laughed inside and thought.. that my pleasure was  bit much, but whatever. 

When I was leaving, I went back to the counter for a water refill. I asked some other woman if she would refill my water. She did, and I said thanks. And what does she say... 'my pleasure'

And now I'm a tad creeped out. Do they forced these employees to say 'my pleasure' with a forced looking smile?

Yeah, I love going to chickfila because everyone is really nice.. whether it is forced or not. So, it makes me wonder what they do to the employees that don't look happy or say 'my pleasure'

Think about it, you never see a pissed off person working at chickfila. I bet they drug them before work... or chain them up and whip them til blood appears if they are asshole employees. I bet that's why they're closed on Sunday... they're punishing their staff."

I'm pastey white. I look terrible. 

I'm also stressed out about not getting into KSU... because if I don't, my plans are shattered and I have to conjure up something new... and I don't have an idea of what that will be.

so, i've got all my shit sent off to ksu. cross your fingers.
i don't know what i'm going to do if i don't get in. 
i don't know what i'm goin to do if i do get in, because i have to figure a whole new financial situation out. But i'm figuring that the financial situation/problem would be a good one. 

Craig graduates soon. I'm excited for him... and have my delta skymiles card in hand if needed on a regualr basis.

Mom found nudity pictures of me today, i was mortified. ask me for the entire story. needless to say, i went and had a beer after that conversation. 

well, i'll go ahead and tell you the story... I dont' really care. If my mom knows, how bad can it get?

The story:

Craig and I are in a long distance relationship... I was hammered one night, he asked me to take some naughty pictures... and I did. I thought I deleted the pictures from the digital camera, but I foudn out today I was wrong. 

Mom confronted me.

Mom : Can you please delete any pictures you take with my digital camera from now on? I found some pictures that I don't think you would want anyone else to see but Craig, and I know I did'nt want to see them. I deletled them for you.

Spring Break Tuscaloosa... was sometihng else. Words can't describe. You just had to be there... or no, you just have to be me to get the full effect.

My 21st is this week... and while I'm not really pumped about it at this moment.. come thursday... I'll be grinning from ear to ear. 

I have a fucking test tonight at 7. A huge writing test. They give you 2 1/2 - 3 hours to get it all done. And while that's plenty of time... I could have mine done in an hour... but here's the shitty part... you have to stay until it's over. No one can leave early. So, I'm going to be at fucking school til about 9:30-10:00 tonight.

The even shittier part... I would have never had to take this test if I would have just stayed out of state. Sometimes I want to punch myself for transfering back to georgia.

<P>2. I need to wreck my car. My kid brother wrecked his ford focus.. and what does he get for a new car? A BMW. Yeah, you tell me... it's really&nbsp; nice. Used, but still a lot nicer than my car... and I've never wrecked mine.</P>

<P>4 Never again will I be a bridesmaid.. I had a misrable time at my last one... and the bride was a bitch and took shit out on me. Fuck her.</P>
<P>5. Everyone seems to be breaking up... or having small crisis... I'm sick of hearing about it. Sick and fucking tired. My boyfriend, mandy, brian, steffan,etc.. blah blah blah blah BLAH (no beth lafond, you are not included in this group.. I know you were wondering) I'm tired of being the 'be there for you friend'... that's all i've been lately.. and I'm tired of it. Full.. filled to the brim.. full of everyone eles' shit. I am actually a happy person, but not lately... I've been stressed out because everyone else is...</P>
<P>6. I'm doing kick ass in school this semester... and it's such a great fucking feeling. I need to continue this. </P>
<P>7. I found some old CD's from highschool... when i went through my techno phase... and they are making a comeback... i love them. So, if you're going to be riding with me anytime soon... you better like techno or just shut the fuck up. </P>
<P>8. With that being said... I'm going to take a drive... and listen to my techno cd.. and smoke a black and mild... because i can.. and because i haven't taken a smoking drive in i dont know how long. </P>

"event","Something is wrong with me.

I had to quit swimming today, because I was dizzy and weak. I got out of the pool in the middle of the workout, and puked. 

I'm sick.. and I hate the emotion that comes with being sick. Everything gets under your skin.

And I've come to one conclusion... after all these years, I'm still terrified. Terrified of change and terrified of making a big decision. 

What happens if I don't get into State or Kennesaw? What next? My grades have been good since I came home.. but I'm afraid that my grades from Auburn might fuck me over. 

So what happens if my foolproof plan fails? I have no idea. And that's scary. 

I'm making myself get together all my application stuff tomorrow.. and then sending it all off Monday. I've been putting it off way too long. I guess to me.. just delaying the inevitable.

And what happens if I do get in? Then I'm in Atlanta... a completely new world from Habersham... and I'll be excited. But the one thing in the back of my head... 'will I be able to find a job where I can take off a weekend every now and then to go see Craig?""

(Terrible, right? I sound pathetic, I know. But, I'm pathetic when it comes to him.. and I'm not hiding it. We're suppose to be honest on these things, right?)

The answer, probably not. I've lucked out with this one job I have now... and even though this job is more relaxed about time off.. I still see him less than I use to.

We came up with a plan.. if I don't get in... I'll just move with him wherever he goes.. and try to go to school there... 

but I'm secretly wondering if that's a good idea at all. While half of me says yes, the other half wants to take a step back... and scream no. 

Am I becoming to dependent on one person? Is this normal? Why don't they give manuals for life? Because I sure as hell need one..."

I went to Beth's house tonight.. rented a movie (Wimbledon).. and the both of us went through a tissue box... we looked like old women blowing our noses. (Oh yeah, the other night we watched the Notebook... and I'm in love... I love that movie)

To make matters better... Craig has the same cold. Oh how cute, we're sick together. Boo. It's not cute... we both sound horrible on the phone.

I'm real tired.. and feel weak. Joy to my heart.

On a happy note.. September is graduating in the Fall... early. While I'm happy for her... it's fucking scary. Everyone is growing up... and I still feel like I'm at the starting line when everyone is done with the race.


My grown up thought....

I really just want to be with Craig. I know it sounds crazy... but in a way, I want to finish school where ever he ends up. I just feel like I'm more productive, happier, and a better person when I'm around him... and did I already say happier?

And you might be saying, ""Jess, he shouldn't be the reason you are happy."" I know, and he's not.. life is just better when I'm around him... than when I'm not. And I don't know anyone who would pick 'good' when they could have 'great'

We've talked about me finishing school wherever he ends up. But, it probably won't happen. Because I know while it sounds good to both of us right now, it's probably best for us to get things done... in a separate town. Because if I moved with him... I wouldn't know anyone... and neither would he...and I've caught myself rambling."

After work last night Jamie, Amy, and I all had drinks... girly drinks. And they were bad. I don't know if I just didn't like the drink or Jamie forgot to put something in it. Her forgetting to put something in it, was probably the case. I forced myself to drink 2 of them... and finally Amy's boyfriend offered me a beer. He was my life saver. He let me drink his beer the rest of the night. And drink I did. 

Woke up on the couch this morning and my head was throbbing. I miss the days when I could drink and not get a hangover. Looked at my phone log.. and text messages. I barely remember calling Craig.. and I barely remember text messaging him... but apparently I just proclaimed my undying love for him over and over and over. But, at least I didn't start a fight (I'm all too good at starting drunken arguments).

Next Saturday... Athens. I'm super excited.

Ummm, Craig called me Friday night drunk... it was cute. He just called to tell me he talked to his best friend and sorted things out. 

The story: his best friend and I apparently got off on the wrong foot and aren't fond of each other. At all. Last time I hung out in a room with his best friend, he was rude, acted like I was invisible, and ended with me telling Craig I wanted to go home and storming out of the room. 

But, Craig went out with him Friday night... and I came up. Craig told me that he told his friend that he's in love with me, I'm his biggest support, my opinon matters to him, I can go out and have a good time, I'm in no way bad  for him, and I'm not a crack whore (one of his other friends is dating one and everyone really doesn't care for her). And his best friend apolagized and said the next time he saw me he was going to be nice and friendly. 

Just because Craig made an effort to talk to his best friend and the fact that he really wants us to get along means the world to me. He didn't have to do that. And I think it's adorable that he did. He's so adorable. Anyway, when he told me all that it made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. He's great.

My next two weekends are as planned:
Saturday... girl night with Courtney and her friends. I'm uber excited. Oh man, you have no idea. 
Sunday... finally getting my bridesmaid dress
Friday after that... flying to Virgina to Diane's wedding. Rehersal dinner
Saturday... Diane's wedding
Sunday.. Flying home around 12ish and driving straight home to work on projects

I'm hoping the weekend after that Craig comes up... I miss him."

It's now 1am, and I have just decided that my idea was a bad one. Furniture is in the hallways, trash bags of stuff that I decided I don't want are in the hallways, my mattress is in the hallway. I have just about cleared out my room, but there is mess everywhere else. 

Everyone is asleep... I'm going to try and get it all cleaned up by morning so no one notices. 

This isn't the first time I've done this. About twice a year in the middle of the night, I decide that I want things differently... and without further thought... start moving everything causing mounds of chaos that normally take a good week to get back in order.

"event","I think this place drags me down. 

Every time I come home, I fight hard not to get depressed. 

This town has a way of making you numb... making you feel like you're going through the motions, but not really all there.

It's hard to stay motivated for school. Like right now, I should be studying for a test I have tomorrow, I know I need to... but I'm putting it off.

I know school is easy, it's only a matter of keeping up with the work... staying on top of it all. One step ahead of the game, I guess. 

I'm just fighting with myself not to fall behind. Fighting with myself, because I would rather not be doing endless homework. 

I need girl friends. 

I went through my address book in my phone... I have way too many guy friends. I love all my guy friends dearly, but they can't give me what I want sometimes. Sometimes all I want to do is go out, have girly drinks and be girly... gossip, look cute, and just tap into the feminine side of me. I've been finding myself wanting that side to come out more often. 

So, I've been working on making girl friends. A couple at school, a couple at work, and old ones. I found myself calling old girlfriends from highschool just to check up on them... telling them that we should get together sometime. I've got a trip planned to Athens in about 2 weeks, just one night of girls being girls. 

Before, every weekend I got off, I was in Tuscaloosa... seeing Craig. He finally told me that I needed to take a week and go see my friends. Go see the ones from Auburn... go see the ones in Athens... just go see them. And I'm going to... but what the crazy part of it all is... at the end of the night, I want to crawl into bed with him and talk endlessly about my night with him. 

Long distance is hard. God, I had no idea how hard it was going to be. 

I called him tonight, and he's out watching the game at a bar with some friends. And, I don't care. In a way, I envy him because he can go and do that any night of the week. I can't. I have to call and make plans or drive for about an hour. I miss a lot of friends being 5 min away.  I miss calling one of my friends from auburn and having lunch and chatting for hours. But here, I find myself alone over a salad at some restraunt. 

Don't get me wrong, I love eating alone sometimes... but it's just nice to have someone join you occasionally.

I'm not afraid of being alone. I probably prefer being alone rather than a large crowd. But, right now... I'm sick of being alone. 

If Beth weren't in Habersham, I don't know what I'd do. I would actually have a breakdown. 

Most people don't know the girly side of me... but, I like girly things. I like the occasional chatty lunch, make up tips, crafts, tlc, and feeling that women are superior. 

I think I'm driving some people nuts... because I keep calling and just want to talk to someone. I babble non-stop. 

Hopefully, I'll make it the next couple of months, and then finally be in Atlanta... and be able to make as many girlfriends as possible."

<P>Weird moment that did occur... Craig and I were wrestling at one point... just playing around. He started getting fiesty... I started getting fiesty... and then I started getting angry... angry at every little thing he had ever done to me... and I hit him. And then I hit him again.. and again... he pinned me to the ground and tried to kiss me... thinking I was playing around... But I wasn't playing. I started kicking and doing everything imangiable to get away from him. Finally, he realized that I was mad... and then he got mad at me for hitting him... he pins me to the ground... so I can't really move or hit him... and asks what the hell is wrong with me. </P>
<P>I could tell he was furious because my hand was pinned up against his neck and he was hot and his pulse was racing... I'd never seen that look in his eyes before. And while looking at him, he looked sad and upset. I teared up... and then he let me go and hugged me really hard. And had a talk.</P>
<P>I was actually hitting him because I was upset about all of the times he hurt me... and in our wrestling match, something snapped in me. I lost it. I ended up telling him that I just got furious about all the times he hurt me and found myself pissed off and venting on him. </P>
<P>It was all werid. VERY WEIRD. We didn't really say too much about it. I think he understood why I did it (not that it's acceptable)... and we didn't say much about it... but from then on... we were both fine... more than fine with each other. I can't explain it, but after keeping some of the anger inside... I finally let it out... and oh my god, I felt so much better afterwards... and I did't hold anything against him either. After that whole 15 min, we never said anything about it the rest of the weekend. We were amazingly great. </P>
<P>Yeah, sounds weird, huh?</P>
<P>For the record, he's never laid a finger on me. ... not even then.. he just pinned me to the ground so I would stop hitting him. And for the record, I've never hit anyone... until now. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anyway, got home... found out I have a lot more money in my bank account than I thought... and it only got better. I checked online for plane tickets (for Diane's wedding)... and now, from Atlanta to Richomond (roundtrip) is only 158.00. Last week it was 222.00&nbsp; ... gee golly wiz I'm happy. </P>
<P>Had an amazing talk with my little brother for 2 hours. He's a senior this year... and I'm so excited for him. He was asking me about college... and we were gossiping about anything and everything. We're closer than we ever have been... and that makes my heart happy. </P>
<P>On the way home today, I was bored and sent text messages to everyone I could think of wishing them a happy MLK day.. but I phrased it differently. He He. </P>
<P>Ummm, and I've got exactly 2 months and 6 days until the BIG 21!!! Yes, I'm having a birthday party.. but not just any birthday party... everyone is invited... if I haven't filled you in yet, I will... I promise. </P>

"event","<P>So, I got some new shoes... I LOVE them! I got them yesterday... I ordered them... and was super excited when they came. As soon as I got home... I ripped open the box and they have been on my feet ever since.</P>
<P>My brother Jim made fun of me. My brother Chris said they were cool... and my frist friend to see them, Beth, looked shocked. And she made a face when I told her I ordered them. I do not think she's a fan. But, it doesn't matter... because I heart them. We then went to play pool... it's kind of sad to think that the first outing in my shoes was to a pool hall.. but whatever. </P>
<P>Pool sucked because of a random guy with no soical skills kept hitting on me.. and kept telling us that we needed to do something the certain way. I was 10 seconds from yelling at him and telling him beth was my girlfriend and to leave us alone. Finally we just got fed up and left. On the way out, the guy told me to have a good night, and like a good bitch that I am... I just looked at him and walked off saying nothing. </P>
<P>Anyway, back to the shoes... I wore them to school today... got complements from some girls... and then one boy told me I had funny shoes... I just looked at him like he had no idea what he was talking about.... and told him that they were the greatest shoes in the world.</P>
<P>But by the end of the day.. the greatest shoes in the world.. gave me blisters. I just have to wear them in... until then but bandaids on my heels. </P>
<P>This weekend... the shoes will be taking a trip to Huntsville to see Craig. He's already seen a picture of them...and I don't think he's impressed. Oh well.</P>
<P>And in case you're wondering what they look like....</P>

16 hours this semester.. and I'm cheating on one hour.. I'm taking a fitness swim class. I love it. I love swimming and started going to the pool on my free time during the fall, but now... twice a week I'm guaranteed. 

Diane's wedding has been moved to Feb 5th... it couldn't come at a worse time. I have so many projects due the week before and week after. Looks like I'm going to be working on the on the plane ride.

I still have to get a ticket... and go do the bridesmaid dress thing. 

Work... lovely.. and I'm not being sarcastic. I finally like it there... well, for what there is to like. 

Family has been driving me crazy... more than usual... but I'm working on that. 

Oh and I'm in therapy again. Haha. I need it badly. I think everyone needs therapy every now and again.. just to prevent nervous breakdowns... I know it's helping me. The first time I went to therapy was in highschool.. I was forced by my parents for numerous reasons... I hated it, didn't want to be there, and lied about everything... I basically told the woman what she wanted to hear. But now, I want to be there... and I wake up in the morning... with a chest not quite so heavy.

New Years day.. I drove down to Tuscaloosa to spend a little extra time with Craig before classes started. The month of December I spent about 20 out of 30 days with him... I could get use to that... but right now it makes me miss him more. 

We celebrated our year mark on the 4th... weird for me.. I've never been in a relationship for this long... consecutively

Speaking of Craig and I... things with us... are wonderful. We were going through a rough patch there for a bit (or I felt like we were)... but last night we had a huge heart to heart... and everything's a-okay now. I feel so much better... and so much happier with him now."

"event","I've been a waitress off and on since 16, so I think I qualify to bitc-,eh, enlighten people to what annoys the fuck out of a waitress. 

You will be judged as soon as you walk in the door by your watier... when you have small children with you.. there will be profanity mumbled under your waiters breath. The look on their face when they greet you.. is fake. We really don't give a shit about how your day has been, we don't give a damn about how cold/hot/beautiful it is outside (we're inside asshole), all we really want you to do is tell us how many people are going to be at your table... and then shut the fuck up. You're stupid jokes that you think are funny are not necissary.

When we sit you down.. get your menus... and ask for your drink order... this is not the time to tell us your meal order. I don't care if you already know, I'm not ready to fucking take your order. And for you people with the order, ""Water no ice"" what the fuck? This is just a pain in the ass and takes longer to fill up. It takes more of my precious time. 

If you have children, don't ask for fucking crackers.. do you know who has to clean up their mess when you're gone? I've watched a two year old demolish packs of crackers... leaving them all over the restraunt. WE have to clean that shit up. We put lids on your kids cups for reasons... it's when fucking parents take the lids off... shit happens. There's nothing like being in the middle of an order only to hear... CRASH... and 'oh no'... looking over to find your little Johnny just spilt a full cup of sticky god damn coke all over the place including himself... and then he cries. The waiter walks over there.. already pissed off behind the fake smile... only to see mom and dad saying 'sorry, is this okay'... NO IT'S NOT MOTHERFUCKING OKAY ASSHOLE. CLEAN THAT SHIT UP YOU DUMB FUCK. YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE FUCKING LID OFF. WE GET PAID LESS THAN 3 BUCKS TO PUT UP WITH THIS SHIT. But do you think we're going to say that? No. We smile, and say... 'it's okay, i'll clean it up don't you worry about it'

When it's time to order... I'll tell you. If you need more time, let me know. I hate standing at a table with a bunch of indecisvie fucks that can't figure out who's going to give their order first... and I can't stand the people that say they're ready to order but then look over the menu for 5 more min reading it aloud and asking me questions about everything possible.

When you ask your waiter 'what's good?'... they probably know just as much as you do. I hate eating at my job. I have tried a total of about 2 items on the menu. When I'm asked what's good, I ususally tell people the thing I never sell or sell the least of... just because I want to see what it actually looks like.

When you order, if you want a side of ranch, honeymustard, mayo or anything else... when I'm taking your order is the time to tell me. The wrong time to tell me is when I'm bringing out your food... while your hot plates are burning my arms, hands, and fingers. If you do this... you will be an eye roll.. and it will not be hidden. Do not start spouting out things that you need, while my hands are full... becaues when you do this.. I will take my sweet time getting those things for you. 

Which brings me to another thing... don't get out of your fucking seat to come looking for me. There's nothing more that pisses me off than the customer that hunts you down. ""What's that? You need more ranch? Well sit the fuck down asshole, I'm with another table right now.. I'll get to you in a second.""

If things look really busy.. drinking your drink like it's your last one... is a bad idea. I understand you're thirsty, but you ahve to understand that you are not my only fucking table. While you are slupring down your 5th drink.. thinking it's cute that you're drinkin so much... I have about 10 other fucks that are doing the same thing. If you keep doing this, I will get nothing done for the rest of the night except filling your glasses. Slow the fuck down, I promise our drink machine will not run out. 

Don't annoy me with chit chat. I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't give a shit about how your car broke down and you walked 5 miles just to get our wings... by telling me things like this, you're just showing what a fucking moron you really are... and that you're stupid... and stupid people dont' tip well... so I will probably not give you as much attention.. because you are a bad tipper. 

When I'm picking up your dirty plates from your table.. when you see my arms are very full.... don't be cute and try to balance one more on my arm. The shit is already heavy... and your balancing act.. will probably result in the plates dumping all over me between your table and the kitchen. I do'nt want your left over food all over me, thank you. I promise, if I can't clear your table at one time... I WILL COME BACK FOR THE REST. 

If you are a shitty tipper. You will be remembered... and given shitty service next time you are in. If you are a good tipper... you will be remembered... and we will kiss your ass next time. If you aren't classified as bad or good.. you will not be remembered.. and your service.. well, your guess is as good as mine. 

And remember people.. we get paid under fucking 3 dollars. More goes on than you think.. sure it looks like we take your order and bring food.. what you don't see is us yelling at the cooks because they fucked something up, cleaning, refilling sweet tea buckets, refilling ice, clearing your fucking table, cleaning it, sweeping, mopping,and dealing with your terrible fucking jokes.. and mannerisms.  

And last but not least... don't ever go to a restraunt 30 min before it closes. FUCKING RUDE. This right here, is guaranteed to get you shit service. I can also guarantee that you will be called numerous things such as bastard, asshole, fucker behind your back. I can promise you, your waiter is not wanting to put their life on hold so you they can serve you for a lousy tip .Anyone who stays at the restraunt longer than it is open.. should be fucking shot.. and will be remembered. Next time you come in, people will refuse to wait on you... you may not know it.. but it will happen. 

But, I have to go.. back to fucking work..."

Today was a jaw dropper... I'm still in shock.

One of my best friends from highschool called me... she's getting married in February... and having a baby in August. This was completely unexpected. And now, I'm flying to Virginia in February to be a bridesmaid. 

I'm weirded out by all of it. 

She was my partner in crime in Highschool... we were connected at the hip my senior year. 

She came down to see me my first year in Auburn... we went to the Georgia game together. And we were shitfaced. God, it was so fun. I drove up to Virginia to see her one summer and we went to DC and got stoned. The friend that came down and saw me this summer when I was going through a really rough time...just to be there for me. 

I guess I'm weirded out because while she said she was happy... there was a certain tone in her voice. I'm know she's scared. But, who am I to say anything? It's her choice to get married... her choice to have the baby... I just question the marriage part. I'm not so sure it's the best decision... to get married because someone gets pregnant. I hope I'm wrong, I hope with everything that I have that she will be completely happy. 

And I guess a part of me is being selfish. I'm not ready to give up that carefree/wild friend... I'm not ready to see her grow up... and I'm not ready for her to be someone's wife... and I'm not ready for someone to call her mommy. 

But, I'll suck it up. I'm utterly stunned. I don't think it's all really sunk in. 

I love her to death, and wish her all the happiness in the world. 

Weird how life works out."

Before thanksgiving... I decided to drive to Tuscaloosa and surprise Craig. 

We hadn't seen each other in awhile, so I figured I'd surprise him. So, I left sunday night.. planning to get to tuscaloosa when he was still working at the gym. He worked from 8-12 that night. 

Anyway, I get there.. I walk in the gym.. see him standing and talking with some of the other people that work there.

As I open the front door.. I started walking in and all of them look to see who it is. The all looked up at me and then back to each other and continued talking.. even Craig.

I keep walking, smiling, confused as to why he looked at me and then looked away and continued with conversation.

All of a sudden, he jerks his head back.. and looks shocked. He starts smiling... I was really proud of myself.. he said he seriously didn't expect to see me for another week or two. A good surprise.

Anyway, story gets good here.

I'm there all of ten minutes talking to Craig in the middle of the gym.. while people are working out. 

I fucking faint. 

All I remember is that I felt dizzy.

Craig said I started falling and he caught me... but alas, I was dead weight.. so he was trying to hold me up.. and my shirt kept rising.. almost showing everyone in the gym my tits. He lays me out on the ground...

Next thing I know, is that I'm looking up at Craig.. he keeps saying my name... and I look at him and tell him I don't feel good. He tells me I just fainted. 

Weird thing, I've never fainted in my life. EVER. 

After the fact, he sets me up, I remember feeling like I was on fire.. and was sweating like crazy. He gets me water... and I feel fine 45 minutes later. Just tired.

Haven't updated in awhile... so here goes.

My job.. is much much better. I work a lot more, but get more money.

Thanksgiving day... some fucker put desitin in the toothpaste spot. So, without looking.. I grabbed my toothbrush loaded it up with what I thought was toothpaste.. and started scrubbing away. Thirty seconds later... I realized the toothpaste was nasty.. so I looked down and saw the letters... D-E-S-I-T-I-N laughing in my face. I screamed and started spitting like crazy. Mom rushes back to the bathroom because of the screaming and begins laughing when she sees my face and the desitin on the counter. 

What is desitin you might be asking? It's for fucking diaper rash. 

I was later informed by my laughing family that my brother, Jim, uses it for athletes foot. Fucking gross.

I feel productive today... I've done homework.. and have to work later... not to mention I've been cleaning like crazy. 

After thanksgiving festivites... Beth and I went back to her house to hang out. We did nothing.. but watch movies. We both got a craving for pizza later.. and drove ingles to get a frozen one... because dominos was close. Fucking thanksgiving.

I also told my family that I would not be around for Christmas... I told them during thanksgiving dinner... not to smart on my part.

My kid brother Jim, then screams out in front of my grandparents, uncle, aunt, mom, and beth... well, I'm getting you something you and craig will both enjoy! And then did a laugh.. my brother chris says he's going to starship to get our present. I wanted to die.. because Starship.. is a huge porn store with sex toys galore.. and if you live in Georgia.. you know what Starship means. I turned bright red and wanted to slam my face down in my plate.. or jump across the room and kick my borhter in the nuts.

Tomorrow is going to suck.. I work all day at work. 10:30-close. Fucking A. I'm going to be oh so tired when I come home."

"event","Yesterday was a shitstorm. 

My second day of work... I would never wish upon anyone. Well, maybe a couple of people I don't like I would.

Friday night, I was told to come into work at 2. So, I did. As I walked through the front doors, I had no idea that I would end up crying twice that night.

Yes, I cried at work. TWICE.

I walk in, and I notice only one other waitress. I assume, that more are coming... because the Auburn-Georgia game was coming on in the next hour and a half and it's a god damn sports bar and grill.

But haha, joke is on me. I ask the other waitress, we'll call Big Bitch where everyone else is, and she tells me, ""It's just us right now, but I'm about to leave.""  

Excuse me?

I just kind of stared back at her in shock. Surely, that has to be wrong, no one would do this to a waitress on her second day. But they did.

Big Bitch, told me she was leaving soon, and that I had to take all of the tables. I despise this person. I have never disliked someone this much.. that I really think it's borderline pure hatred. So, she takes 2. 2 I say. And how many do I have? That answer would be 10. On my seocond damn day. I was still learning their computer system. I honestly, had no clue to how everything really worked. 

So, I'm running around like a chicken with its head cut off. And, big bitch, what is she doing? Sitting her fat ass down having a smoke, and yelling at me to pour sugar into the tea. FUCK THAT. FUCK HER.

I igonored her. I did what I could do to get everything done, to the best of my ability. But, more people started coming in and they were drinking beer as if it were their last. J, my boss, started yelling at me becausse I messed up an order. 

And then I cried. 

In front of everyone... I just started crying. I did not give a damn who saw me. J asked me what was wrong, and I just screamed, 'she's not taking any tables, this is my second day and you slammed me with all of this, this is ridiclious' and then I cried some more. 

He put his arm on my back and told me to settle down. He looked around at all the other tables, called Big Bitch into the back and let her have it. Big bitch, was then pissed off at me... and while we were both back in the kitchen... I was standing by the sink.. full of water, and she threw a dirty plate in their, splashing me all over. She looked at me and said, 'oops,' and walked out. 

Finally, after the game was over.. Auburn won, which made me smile. They get good when I leave, but at least they got good this year. Two other waitress show up for dinner. They ask me how it went, and I told them, trying not to cry again. The two that came in... I'll call Amber and Jenna. But, Amber hugged me and told me that Big bitch is a waste of oxygen and that everyone hates her. Which made me feel a lot better.

A little bit later... Alex came to see me. I haven't talked to him in awhile, and he promised he would come up and see me today. He asked me if I wanted to go drink a couple of beers after work and hang out and catch up. He started dating this new girl that he wanted to tell me about, and I was excited for him. So, I tell him I shouldn't be getting off too late, because I was there at 2 and had to do the Auburn-Georgia game.

Wrong. Wrong. Fucking Wrong. 

I walked up to J, and asked him what time I was getting off, if it were around 8. His response, ""No, no, no, no. You work all night.""

""What are you kidding me? You're making me work 8-9 hours on my second day after putting me through the Aub-Ga game? I've never. NEVER. Had to work at any restraunt more than 5 hours."" I started crying agian.

So, I was there.. from 2-10:45. And hated every minute of it. 

J, is korean. and I despise him as well. He thinks we're slaves. And I seriously hope Big Bitch loses her job, or something bad happens to her. She is a terrible person. I have never met anyone like her. Terrible. 

After work, I called Craig, started crying and found out his grandpa had a stroke. He was having a terrible day too. I told him I wanted to drink a couple of beers and forget about the night... but he pointed out that it wasn't such a good idea to drink while I'm upset. So, I went to beth's for awihle.. went home, and talked to Craig for the rest of the night.. he calmed me down more than anything else. 

I feel better today.. but yestereday, was a nightmare."

Boss man was impressed with my skills... so I get to train/waitress tomorrow. And he was putting me on the schedule for this weekend.

I go and take a look at the schedule... and I stand there in bewilderment. It's not in english. I grab another waitress, ""What the fuck is this?"" Her reply, ""Oh, he writes it in Korean so you have to ask him.""

What the fuck? That's all I have to say about this. What the fuck? 

Already, I know this job is going to be an eye opener. 


Lets see, what else... haha.. here's something good for you. I'd make fun of me too.. but who cares.

This morning, I was freezing my ass off. And, it was raining to make things even better. I decided that jeans were not enough to keep me warm throughout the day... So, I took my jeans off... and put on pantyhose... and put my jeans back on.

Yes, the entire day I had pantyhose on under my jeans. 

Yes, I feel like I'm a 60 year old woman... but at least I'm warm, damnit. And yes, I will probably do this throughout the winter time. 

More good news, Craig found out yesterday that he IS graduating in May. I'm excited for him. I can't wait for that feeling... knowing that I have no more school. He was talking about getting a job close to Atlanta... that would be so so so great if it worked out. Then, we'd be a helluva lot closer. Not to mention, I'll be in Atlanta too!


I watched Bridget Jone's diary tonight with beth and her mom... and am uber excited about seeing the sequal Sunday! I might even whip out some heels for the event."

Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony. 

A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation. 

Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton. 

The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay. 

If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex. 

Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism. 

HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart. 

Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools. 

A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy. 

Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet. 

The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's cocaine conviction is none of our business. 

Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness, and you need our prayers for your recovery. 

You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt. 

What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant. 


Friends don't let friends vote Republican!"

"event","Well, another weekend in Tuscaloosa. I was planning on a quiet weekend at home.. doing homework.. moving... working out.. and hanging out with my mom. But, that didn't happen. 

I went to the movies with my Mom Friday night.. and we saw 'Shall we dance' ... major chick flick.. but I loved every single minute of it. Ahhh, Richard Gere. 

Anyway, Craig text me during the movie wanting me to come down and go to the game with him and his parents. It didn't take much arm-twisting.. and I was on the road.. headed for T-town by 9:30pm. 

I had a great time at the game.. his mom and I followed Craig, his dad, and his cousin around for hours while they scalped tickets. We had a few good laughs. Good times.

Sunday we just hung out... until Craig had to go to work.. so I decided to go run/walk.. and ran around Denny Chimes. I will give this to UA.. I love that area... it's so pretty.

Sunday night.. was interesting. Craig was playing on the computer... I was getting some work for school done... and he stops, looks up at me, and says, ""Quit prank calling my ex girlfriend"" I had no idea what he was talking about. It appears that while I was doing my work.. she Im'd him and told him to tell me to grow up and quit prank calling her. It made me laugh for a couple of reasons...

1. I don't know her phone number, and don't want it.
2. Craig and I have been together for a good 10 months now. She actually thinks that I would take time out of my day to prank call her.
3. I haven't prank called anyone since middle school.
4 I think this is the best part... apparently, who ever it was said there name was Jessica. I like the fact that she automatically assumed it was me. Plus, there are a billion people with the name Jessica. Her justification was that the girl had a deep voice. Hello, that's not me. 

We both had a good laugh about it... Craig made me laugh when he said, ""Well, she thinks pretty highly of herself if she thinks that you'd go to all that trouble to prank call her... and it's funny because she thinks it's you.""

Anyway, that was my funny story for the weekend. Everything else.. was great. I left eary this morning for class... and I hate that drive back. But, seeing him was worth it."

"event","So, I'm sitting in the library right now... I just finished my 'diet diary'.. god, what a joke.

I had completely forgotten that we had to do one for class... thank god, some kid in my class asked if I did mine or not today. As soon as he said it, I said, ""Fuck me,"" he laughed.. and told me he had just finished his in the library. 

What a joke, does the woman really think we do her work.. and how we're suppose to? Fuck No. I laughed my ass off when I got in here, because there are about 10 other people in my class doing theirs as we speak. We were all talking back and forth.. asking what food items we should put down. I would have love to see Mrs.Welch's face if she walked in... only to see half of her class working on an assignment that was suppose to be done a week ago. Oops.

The library is always freezing. I who ever contols the tempature. Right now, I'm sporting one of Craig's huge sweatshirts... His Cleveland Browns one.. it was the only thing I had in my car, and is about 4 sizes to big. 

I feel productive this week.. getting all of my work done.. what a nice feeling. If only I can keep it up. 

I need to go drop of applications today, but will probably do it tomorrow.. due to the fact that I look like shit. I rolled out of bed the last second.. pulled my hair up in a half ass pony tail.. no makeup.. and jeans. I wouldn't hire me. 


NOTE TO ELIZABETH  >>>> Sorry about the room mate situation. That blows. If you need advice on how to handle it.. call me or something, I was in your spot 2 years ago. If you don't want advice... I know ways to piss her off... things to do that will make her livid... you're guaranteed a good laugh out of it. Or maybe I'm just slightly sadistic.

NOTE TO BETH >>> I feel the same way you do... have you noticed.. that we always go through these spell together? It must be fate! 

NOTE TO KT >>> COME HOME, DAMNIT. And bring ole' September with you... and Mr. Robert... I still have to meet his boy. Only the best for Robert, I'll greet him at the door Habersham style... with a shotgun and a bottle of Jack."

"event","Yeah, I don't know anymore. 

I'm just really really tired... a lot. I think the lack of sleep I get is catching back up with me.

I love not having a job... well, for the moment anyway. But, too bad for me, I don't get that option. I have to turn in applications tomorrow. Not to mention, Christmas is around the corner.. and gifts have to be bought. Fucking Christmas.. just when you think you're starting to save money.. that rolls around and knocks you back to the ground. I wish I was still in 2nd grade, and could make everyone a house out of sticks and wrap it up. Maybe I should do that.

I felt alive for an hour today.

A feeling I've missed... and I want back.

I was invited to a meeting at school. The only reason I went... I had free time and nothing else to do. I had no idea that I would love it so much. I almost forgot what it was like to interact with people... and discuss issues. God, it was so nice. 

After the meeting, I was offered a membership, but I told them I didn't know. Because I don't know if I'll be able to have time for it after I get another job. 

I registered... I'm excited... because I got the two classes that I really needed. Two education classes. One of them, I'm going to finally be able to go into schools... which, I can't wait. The other is the special education class. It's only on Monday.. but it's from 5-8pm. 

I've decided that I still have major issues with my father. Well, Craig helped me realize it... actually he slapped me in the face with it. I cried when Craig said it, because it wasn't what I wanted to hear... but needed to hear. For the first time in my life, the rose colored glasses came off. And, I'm so thankful. I still haven't figured out how I'm going to address anything... but now... I've gotten rid of my false hopes. 

A lot has been going on in my head. A LOT. I'm really starting to wonder if secrets you keep to yourself.. that no one else knows.. will eventually destroy you. 

Anyway, after everything was said and done... for once, I feel like I'm coming out on top. For once, I feel like I'm finally being able to sift through the shit... and feel like I'm making slow progress. But, slow is better that nothing, right?"

"event","My title for this entry... is the big sticker on all of the computers in the library.. and I don't think I know how to spell library. HA!

God, this weekend was interesting to say the least. 

I went to Huntsville to see Craig and his folks.. fun times. Saturday we got up early and drove to Tennessee for the Jack Daniels BBQ cookout. Took a tour of the distillery... I had fun. The BBQ there, wow. They were having a competition... so there was all types of BBQ... and damn good BBQ. I think we all gained 5lbs that day.


So I'm going to be super busy this week. I have class work up to my eyeballs.. thank god, I don't have a job right now... so, I'll have time to get it all done. 

My interview... is now 'on' again... tomorrow 10:30. Cross your fingers, damnit.

Wed, Thurs, and Friday... I'm hoping to be in Atlanta donig a workshop with Craig's mom. I hope I can con my teacher into letting me have an extra day off... because I think it'll be a great experince... and a wonderful resume side item.

So much to do this week... I haven't even thought about my Halloween costume. Which, I will dress up again this year.. and be at B's infamous Halloween costume. Last year... yeah, well.. Austin and I were the only ones dressed up.. but good times had. 

Not to mention Craig's birthday on Friday... thank god, I already gave him his gift.. .because I don't know when I would have the time to plan anything this week. I took him to Oakland for an A's game... so I don't think he'll be too upset when he gets a card on Friday. Who knows, maybe I can con him into coming up here for the Halloween party... and be my date."

"event","The sounds of settling... funny how you never know you settled for something until it's over and done with.

I wish they gave away degrees. I hate school, no, I hate taking classes that I know are pointless. It's frustrating.

I have a job interview tomorrow. God, I hope it works out... but I've learned not to keep my hopes up about job interviews. I'm just hoping... damn, I need this.

I feel like a hampster in it's cage running is heart out and going no where.. I feel like I'm in a cage half of the time and I can't figure out how to get out. 

I have this communications class that I hate. I hate it. And now we have a group project. If there's one thing in the world I hate.. it's group projects with people you are assigned to. I in no way shape or form want to interact with these people, but now I'm being forced.

I hate that I have to have a degree. I want to quit. I know I'm not a 'college person'.. who came up with that quote anyway? ""College person"" who the fuck is a college person, I've yet to really meet one.

Sometimes, I feel like I'm drowning in this town... and I can't tell which direction is up. 

I wish they gave away degrees in the lottery.

And I hate going from class to class all day... it seems that every class piles on more and more work. By the end of the day you feel like you're going to have a nervous breakdown... and you try and try to figure out how you're going to have time to do the work... finding yourself saving sleep for another week and pulling all nighters... the next week comes... and more work piled on top again.

Sometimes I wish I needed prozac. i need to wash my hair.

There seems to be something that's beautiful about having a breakdown.. seeing a side of you that you rarely see.

I love the friends that actually ask how your day is.. and care. God, they're too few.

I'm going to go outside and smoke a cig and then scream as loud as I can."

"event","So a lot has happened in the last couple of days. God the dramas of my life...

I am now unemployed. But, this is because of my doings.. I didn't get fired, I quit. I quit on Friday. 

Yes, this is very unlike me just quitting.. not giving a 2 weeks notice.. but it was deserved. Something happened.. bad... and I just said fuck it.. that's it for me. What happened? Call me and I'll fill you in on the details.. it's that bad.

So, I said fuck it all... and went to see my boyfriend in Tuscaloosa. He made me feel great.. and we had a fablous time together. 

Went to a Bama game.. my first one. Never thought I would actually attend a Bama game without Auburn playing in it.. haha. It was slightly weird. A year ago I would have sworn that I would never watch Bama... but I did.
Never say never, eh?"

"event","So a topic came up at work tonight.. it made me uncomfortable.

At first I was very uncomfortable.. and then, upset. But, I kept my mouth closed the entire time.

I left work.. on the verge of a breakdown... slightly angry... I'm not sure exactly what I was feeling, but it wasn't pleasent.

I called Craig, because I really needed to talk to him. Just get it all out, because he's the only one that really understands. I call, and it rings four times and then voicemail. I didn't leave a message. I sent a text message.. no response. About thirty minutes later I'm a mess, so I call again... this time, two rings and straight to voice mail. I leave a message. Now, I'm getting angry.

Why am I angry? Because everyone with a cellphone knows it is about five rings when someone doesn't answer then voice mail.. and everyone knows that if it's under that... the person calling... pressed the ""decline"" button. I'm slightly livid right now... because I know he's ignoring the call and text message... and I know he always has his phone with him.

Fucking wonderful... when I need to talk to him most, he presses decline. 

God damnit I'm not happy... the depression/sadness just shot up to pissed off."

I stopped on the bridge to make sure the ducks and geese were following us. I noticed this little fella and he got tossed some cracker crumbs. We quickly had several turtles headed our way.

<img src=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/digiduckie/misc/Frenchmans%20Creek/DSC01141resize.jpg>
We get on the island and near the edge to feed them all. See, more turtles. We even had large fish coming around for food. They were koi I think. The geese would fight with the turtles, pecking at their shells. The turtles seemed to be biting them.

Beth feeding the ducks. We tossed some crackers in front of the kids and they freaked. I feed the ducks out of the palm of my hand. A goose wanted some too, but hissed at me and it made me think of feeding a snake. No thank you!

This was taken in an area equestrian estate community of more than 500 acres. This is where most of the area's rich people live. I have delivered to many of these homes when I worked with the mattress and bedroom furniture company. They are very nice inside and out.

I rode around yesterday taking pics of various things, including the one above. I need to get some filters for my camera. I swear that in 95% of the shots the sky was white and not blue. GRRRR! It sucks because I liked several of the images and would've made them into submissions for my daily pics, but the damn sky was white."

I was going to take a pic of an albino frog that was floating in some water. It was in an aquarium and I was going to put the camera right up against the glass and take get it floating in the water with its eyes just sticking up out of the water. I think it would've been a cool shot, however, the woman working there just had to show us that he would jump and try to eat her finger if she put it against the glass. That was cool though."

<font size=""-2"">The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe</font>

""<i>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door--
Only this and nothing more."" </i>""

This was shot with a hard back book I own called ""Edgar Allan Poe Sixty-seven Tales"". I got this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Edgar-Allan-Poe-Sixty-Seven-Tales/dp/0517092905"">book</a> while living over in Saudi Arabia. There wasn't much to do over there and I often turned to reading and this was my favorite books that I owned. I only have a small collection of books now. It's a rarity that I read a book anymore, but when I do I'm usually reaching for this one. The entire poem may be found <a href=""http://www.online-literature.com/poe/335/"">here</a>."

I took this shot the other day on the way back from Washington. I had just turned off of one highway and began getting speed up on another and suddenly I catch this out of the corner of my eye. I check my rearview mirror, no cars. I slam on brakes and Beth looks at me like WTF? I begin backing the car up and I tell her that there is a horse in this house. Needless to say I got some weird looks. I stop and she looks over to see this horse sticking its head out of the front window. There were large portions of the side walls missing.

This is what I think was really going on. The horse sticking its head out the window said to the other horse in there, ""Look, I got another one to stop and back up."" This other horse says ""You are so embarrassing."" I back up to take a few pics and the other horse is hiding for the most part. I could see just a little bit of its hind end in another window."

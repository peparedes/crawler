"event","Time flies, I guess. This is my first journal entry for years. Makes me wonder about all the profound thoughts I've had and forgotten about in that time. Journals are good things I think, though this is really the only one I've ever kept. I was watching TV the other day and wondered why we can't come up with a way to harness energy from nuclear waste. Our own planet thrives on the radiation of the Sun. Damnit, why can't the Sun talk!? My daughter Josephine will be 2 years old this May. I hardly see her. I feel like such a child to not be dealing with this situation any better. I'm scared to death of being a father. I suppose it's easier for me to not be. Quit being so selfish."

"event","OK.  I've had a rough time so far thinking of things to put into my journal. Today I thought of something that I've always believed, and spoken about with close friends, but then I realized that this sort of thing is exactly what should go into my journal. (This is irrevelant, but right now, just for reference, I've just come home from the local bar, I've ingested some Jameson Irish whiskey, some cold Coors Light, and some mysterious white powder. Now I sip on a Bud Light left at my house by a great friend who just got home from Iraq [and before that it was Afghanistan]) Here it is -- The Big Thing -- I find it utterly repulsive that most people tend to think of the Human race as a superior species. What could be further from the truth? So what. We have cognitive abilities (or so we think) much greater than, say, a Whitetaled Deer, or maybe a Slug, if we need to go that far. So we can add, and do all sorts of mathematics. So what. We can put down our thoughts in a manner (which we have, after all, only created) that will be intelligible to our species for aeons to come, and that will nurture the growth of knowledge of future generations. So fucking what, I ask. We also destroy our own environment (And who said it was ours to begin with - I don't think we own this place just because we are ""smarter"" than all the other animals. I think we, as a species, completely overestimate our rights as tennants of this wonderful Earth - our only home (so far). The Slug, for instance, although it may not know its importance or abilities, much less try to further those traits, simply exists. It does only what it knows instinctively to do, whatever that may be. It does not seem to want, it does not seem to try to dominate other things. It takes what the world gives it and does its best to survive and procreate. No greed shows through its existence. I simply ask, why do we? If there is anything the Human race can do, in my opinion, to better ensure a HAPPY and Fruitous life here, it is to realize that we are no more important than the Squirrel, or the Fish, or the Tree, or the Rock. We co-exist with these entities, and I believe all of us ""roomates"" will be better off when we cease trying to dominate, and satisfy ourselves with merely living to the best of our abilities with what NATURE provides us, and quit trying so hard to make everything better, and more convenient.

Now on the other hand, there is a formidable argument to be defended that such is the nature of every being on Earth, and that we are just blessed with the superior, or nearly superior, ability to capitalize on what Nature provides us. I struggle to define this argument, and make sense of Homo Sapiens seemingly arrogant behavior. Eastern philosophy drives me to say that everything is exactly as it is supposed to be, and that we are behaving the only way we instinctively know how. But if so, my ""Ultimately Superior Reasoning"" cannot help but find some dissapointment with our recent history of corruption, tyranny, and injustice to our  other ""roomates"" on this beautiful planet we call Earth.

Man, I'm fuckin' Jacked. Good night. At 7:00 a.m. I will continue my new job as a humble carpenter. Laughing and joking as much as possible."

"event","I was just outside on the porch smoking. I was thinking that our world is so obviously a living organism. So many similarities quickly came to me. The trees look like the bronchioles in a lung. Not that our universe is, actually, a lung, but maybe some sort of filtering device for whatever our planet would be considered. A cell? 
Fire. That's what I concluded was the root, and cause, of man's counterproductive destruction of his environment -  despite my conviction that men are not evil at heart. No other creature on earth creates fire. That's not part of their culture. Then manmade objects jumped out - cars, houses. I compared them to maybe, proteins, or something of the sort. Perhaps cells possess knowledge in a limited quantity, and a ""life"" going on within their borders. It is quite obvious when you see something through microscope that some bizzare things are going on in that parameceum, or whatever you're looking at. So I could go on but I won't for long, so if you boil that down we are all a part of God. Neat, huh?"

"event","Well, here I am again. Sitting at my desk (I have a desk!) wondering what tragedies or triumphs await me this week. At the moment I'm watching George W. Bush on CNN Headline news - what a smug shit-for-brains that guy is. It's pure speculation, but I think the guy has lied so many times in his life that it no longer bothers him. He lies like an old pro. He's convincing until you read about the shit behind the scenes - then a very different picture presents itself. And it seems the only people I know personally who really understand the magnitude of it all are people 30 or younger. Well, it won't be too long before my age group has some political weight to throw around. I just hope the folks who get appointed to important political positions aren't a bunch of sell-out scmucks, living and dying for the almighty dollar. Have some fucking pride, you feeble-minded pussies!"

"event","Fuck the carb diet-people. I am overdosing on the little morsels of time-release energy this evening. Angel hair alfredo from a box, most of a bag of Cheddar Munchies and finally a bag of Lipton Mexican rice. The flatulence is foul and overbearing, though few and far between in abundance. The newly generated gasses from somewhere about my small intestines must have a hard journey through the more densely packed lower section, involving severe hairpin turns and the colon. --- --- --- I can't seem to get past the rut I am in at work with a PC version of Pac-Man. My slow, dial-up, windows '98 gateway doesn't seem to have what it takes to run the program for a 2 dimensional video game written twenty years ago. Thanks so much to these new high-tech computers! Of course the fault does not rest solely on the machine I am using. I have been trying to employ patterns discovered by some nerd long ago - which prompts me to chew the idea that I want to be great at it without much effort on my part, no hard-earned pride attached - well, at least I'd prefer a shortcut to being an expert. I am tempted to think that I can somehow bypass the torturous work involved in really understanding the game. It's much like music for me, I suppose, and the approach I have taken with so many things. And I will argue that it is human nature. And if I can live an enjoyable life with less effort then I can almost rationalize that it is ok to settle for ""pretty good."" Am I cheating myself? I don't know. I have a good life, I think. It could be better, but it could definately be worse. What would become of the other aspects of my life if I focus so hard on just one? If I enjoy something so completely, wouldn't I be subliminally driven to do more of it? Be it Pac-Man or playing the guitar, or whatever? Why does my subconcious mind seem to affect me with its motivational inertia? Why do I try to skip past the race and on to the finish line when my concious mind knows that the race is where all the meat, and all the worth and all the fun really is?"

"event","The cigarettes don't last long in cold weather like this. Four or five minutes and you're stiff. Toss another butt into the coffee can and back in the house to the Dead, and more laundry. Coffee in the pot is all gone again, but the supplies of sugar and half & half are running surplus. Another few cups? I think I shall after I finish my Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Laundry should be ready for attention by then. I got news that Courtney is newly engaged, bringing yet another in a long line of disappointments that, although inevitable in life, come no more welcome. Our half-hearted pact of eloping at 35 now seems a moot point to ponder any longer. Maybe the psychological shedding of this type of emotional baggage, with which I seem loaded compared to my peers, will allow me to seek more worthwhile social endeavors. Emotional rescue must be out there and in comparison to the lottery I wonder if it is better to always play the same number (which it seems would be statistically correct) or to pick a new number with each day. It would be risking boredom to stay with the statistical approach that surely leads to a more predictable and possibly inferior  outcome. I tip my hat to the past, and greet new circumstances with reluctant enthusiasm."

"event","Just returned from a local tavern, where I was involved in heavy drinking and ate some fine Shanghai wings. For whatever reason I was inclined, as was my roomate, to journey far from our normal dark-beer-territory and into the unfamiliar haunts of foreign liquor drinks and various other concoctions. I came up with a number of theoretical new shots:
       Dysintery of the Yeti - 2/3 Bacardi 151, 1/3 Mayonnaise
       Tobacco Sunrise - 1/4 water, 1/4 tabasco, 1/4 powder snuff, 1 cigarette butt
       Polar Bear's Ass - 1/2 cottage cheese, 1/2 tequila
       Innocent Whore - (actually drank one of these) - 1/4 creme de menthe, 1/4 midori, 1/4 ?, 1/4?

Anyway, I decided that I could write a book; Worst Shots Ever Invented and make profits to lessen the burden of $42.00 tabs at the watering hole.  Though the wings and nachos cause no regret toward their 25% contribution to the bill."

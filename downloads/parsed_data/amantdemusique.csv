"event","Hey y'all!

Well I hope you all had a wonderful new years cause I sure did.  I got up and got ready to go pick up nessa to go to Madison's house.  I was to be a server for her mother's new years party/wedding.  So we get there and blow up balloons and make h'ors d'oeurve's (I think that's how you spell it) and stuff.  So then I wait till Brandon arrives and Sharise ,my co-server to arrive and then the party begins.  I have never seen so many bottles of champagne and wine go out.  Sharise and I were working like dogs just gettin food ready and serving and cleaning but it was so much fun.  Sharise is one awesome and fun girl!  But while we were stuck in our haze, Brandon and Nessa played absolutely gorgeous music.  It was awesome.  But yeah the night ended with me getting paid $150 just to serve and watch people just get totally smashed.  It was a lot of fun surprisingly.  

Heheh, anywho....here are my new years resolutions:
1.) Lose some weight and watch my eating habits
2.) Lose 20-30 pounds before May
3.) Focus more on my studies this next semester (work before play scenario)
4.) Save my money
5.) Write in this bloody journal everyday to get some stress out :)
6.) Become ambidextrous before the end of the year

And that's it.  Till tomorrow, adieu!"

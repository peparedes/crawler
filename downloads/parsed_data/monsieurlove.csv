"event","So, we are poised on the very brink of acquiring a car soon - in fact, on Monday November 5! I can hardly express my relief at having a car again. While I really do like the idea of living a car-free lifestyle, I have been increasingly feeling like Vancouver is ""almost"" suited to this lifestyle (if one lives downtown as we do) but not entirely. And that's the real catch, there are numerous life situations one might encounter that are trivial if one has a car, and an exercise in patience without one.

We have got a fairly reasonable (and at times, incredibly frustrating) transit system, and we rely on it heavily, as well as Zipcar, and rental cars, but honestly, owning a car is going to be such a liberation, such an enabler, that we are fools to not do it. And so, excitement. Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah forever amen!

Our soon to be car is a lovely 1984 Mercedes-Benz 300D Turbo. This is the 123.133 chassis with engine OM 617.952 - both lovely examples of a car series that is legendary for reliability. Seriously. A 300D (I think) recently passed the million mile mark, owned by a couple in California who are reportedly ""considering"" buying a new one. Our car is being sold to us by its original, no-accidents, 24-complete-years-of-service history owner, with a mere 304,000 km on it. I hope to, at the very least, pass the million kilometre mark with relative ease and happiness in it. It's a lovely bamboo metallic green, with tan leather interior which is nearly perfect for its age. I seem to recall it has rear headrests too, which is a nice (and safe!) option.

On a more prosaic note, we'd originally decided to buy it so that Rebecca could drive to work. But now that her office is basically moving straight into the heart of the DTES (aka junkytown, aka crackton), it looks like I am going to be driving her to and from work each day. Parking there means ""having to walk to and from the parking lot"" and possibly having our car defaced or windows busted. Yikes! So doing the chauffeuring is fine by me, since it is by far the safest way for her to get to and from work and I'd balk at any other option, especially when I have the power to make things easier and safer for her. I'd walk her there and back myself if I had to, and carrying a baseball bat if I had to (or maybe even something more badass) but given the car option, I'll take it. I guess it's pretty good timing!

It is rather lamentable, though, that small businesses have to move to shitty neighbourhoods just because commercial real estate is so expensive here. I am sure I have often been accused of being a limousine liberal, or a champagne communist, but honestly if the real estate situation in Vancouver doesn't count as a national emergency, I don't know what does. I guess I am rambling though becuase the real focus of this post was supposed to be:

1) I am glad I will soon have the ability to convey my dear wife safely (and in comfort) to and from work
2) I am glad we are buying such a coooooooool car

The end! 

ps. Now which with is the deceleratrix and which is the velocitator? Fill it up with petroleum distillate and re-vulcanize my tires, post-haste!

pps. No petroleum distillate allowed. Our new car is a diesel!"

"event","So, it is finally done! Almost 13 months after we began this journey to make the immigration happen, it was all done in a day's drive to Seattle and back!

Leaving early in the morning, we hoofed it down to Seattle and almost got to the Consulate when they opened. A few minutes later, Rebecca's passport was handed over, and we came back and picked it up about five hours later. In the meantime we amused ourselves by walking around a lot, finding things to eating, and riding the monorail out the space needle and visint the science centre. There I realized a long-held ambition to make up for my last visit (as a lad) where I was too afraid to ride the high-rail bicycle, and so I did it this time. It only took me about 15 years!

Rebecca got her passport back, complete with Immigration Visa, and then we set off to drive back. I tell you what, I cannot even handle navigating in Seattle on foot, much less by car, and this only steeled my resolve. Poor sinage, incredibly steep hills, nonintuitive traffic control, the works. Bad Seattle, no!

We stopped and did a bit of shopping and eating of dinner on the way back, and then crossed the border in a most expeditious manner. After so long, the actual process seemed a bit anticlimatic to me, but maybe I had silly expectations, like them playing O Canada or something. The important thing is that it's done!

And now, to bed!"

And it only took a little less than 4 months from the time we submitted papers until the passport request came through. We'll probably be heading down this coming week to the Canadian Consulate in Seattle do finish the processing off (since it is a lot faster to appear in person than to get the landing visa by mail).

Holy! the CIC (Citizenship and Immigration Canada) processed our sponsorship on June 12 (after receiving it May 9) and have made a decision about my eligibility to sponor my darlin' wife! Of course, they don't /say/ on the website what that decision was, but given that there is no possible reason for them to deny me the right to sponsor, we're just assuming it means that yes, I am her sponsor. Hopefully just a few weeks left for it to all get done!

"event","It was a pretty good long weekend. I felt weirdly quiet for part of it, but I am not entirely sure why. I think I have just been in a bit of a mood for cocooning and staying in a bit more than usual. It has likely got something to do with the weather. Honestly I am tired of it myself.

Friday was beautiful outside - we went to the aquarium and saw some dolphins (whatever, the dolphins we saw in Hawaii were both wild and also cooler than these ones), and also some cute sea otters who know how to hold hands (as seen on youtube). I forget what else we saw exactly, some Beluga Whales (silly lookin') and a lot of sea anemones (practically the only thing which grows in the Strait of Georgia, if you believe the aquarium). A sea lion made a face and looked at me + also made a howling noise (I think he was just saying hi) and we also saw a seal.

We had a small easter egg hunt, which was fun, and I was excited to give vague hints about where to find eggs. As of this writing, there are two that were not found, doy. I forgot I had even hid them!

Cousin + family (my cousin-in-law and his family) came over for the afternoon on saturday, which was very nice. I always like hanging out with them, and they are good fun. We went out for dinner later and I had a burger that had something to do with a ""butt rub"" - it was delicious.

I've been reading World War Z and I highly recommend it.

I am tired of being in the office.

We are going to sign up for zipcars! So exciting! It'll be a nice convenient way to use a car when we need it, which is admittedly a rare occurrence. But being able to have one only at those times, and at the drop of a hat (within reason) is going to be great.

UPS makes me mad. Scotiabank, makes me mad too, lately. I don't like us getting charged for customs brokerage fees that we didn't agree too, I don't like Scotiabank putting a hold on my wife's deposits. I would like the PR process to hurry up and proceed more quickly so that we can get on with things. One step at a time -- and thankfully, we're doing well on getting things ready for submission. Don't get me wrong, I am glad we're working on it, it's just, man, in the meantime, not having the process done can make some elements of daily living awkward. Doy.

Ten good things from the weekend:

1) Waking up each day next to my lovely wife
2) An excursion to the aquarium on Friday
3) Seeing relatives on Saturday
4) Taking some impromptu portraits of my new first-cousin-once-removed-in-law
5) Relaxing around the home with my wife, and reading books in bed
6) Eating a tasty roast together
7) Watching The Last Temptation Of Christ, which surprised me at how much I enjoyed it
8) Visiting with friends Saturday night
9) Goofing off at the car show on Sunday
10) Seeing my wife smile (okay, this is a good thing about every day)"

HILARY DUFF LYRICS

""Sweet Sixteen""

Today I'm gonna ride away
And feel the sun throughout my hair
Finally free to be who I wanna be
Who that is I don't really care

'Cuz I've got friends who love me
Blue skies are above me
My blonde hair is everywhere

[Chorus:]
Sweet sixteen
Gonna spread my wings
Sweet sixteen
It's my chance to shine
Sweet sixteen
Discovering
Sweet sixteen
So much more to life
Sweet sixteen

Drivin' down to the club where we go to dance
Radio is blastin' and the top is down

There ain't nothin' in my way
'Cept the traffic of L.A.

And I've got friends who love me
Bright stars shine above me
My blonde hair is everywhere

[Chorus]

Mamma loves me and a sister who shows me, and a daddy's always there

[Chorus]

I wanna know what it feels like
I need to see it from the inside
I can taste a bit of what I will find
So much more to life
Sweet sixteen


Lmao! Its so great being sixteen!! GO PATRIOTS!!"

HILARY DUFF LYRICS

""Love Just Is""

When the night won't fall and the sun won't rise
And you see the best as you close your eyes
When you reach the top as you bottom out
But you understand what it's all about

Nothing's ever what it seems
In your life or in your dreams
It don't make sense, what can you do
So I won't try makin' sense of you

[Chorus:]
Love just is... whatever it may be
Love just is... you and me
Nothing less and nothing more
I don't know what I love you for... love just is

When you ask to stay and disappear
It seems you're gone but you're really here
When every move seems out of place
But every kiss is filled with grace

Some things never get defined
In your heart or in your mind
It don't make sense, what can you do
So I won't try makin sense of you

[Chorus]

Don't ever ask me for reasons
I can't get to you
Don't ever ask me for reasons
Why I live for you... I just do"

"event","Ok, me and Danny had a huge fight last night. Troy came over to my flat and was ranting about he wants me back. I cussed him out and slammed the door in his face! Then he ran to Danny and told him that I was keeping secrets. Dangerous secrets. Danny knows there is stuff I don't tell him. So of course being the kind of boo who worries he rushed to my house. I had already left to go to the doctors to get some cat scans. My bro told him all bout the chest pains, headaches and respetory probs. I didn't tell Danny coz I didn't want him to worry!! This REALLY sucks!  We haven't talked since last night! I g2g! Bye

""Breezy""

Are you ready?
Are you ready?

I get shoppin sprees off the heezy
I get dough to blow, please believe me
Don't want the one on one
Take it easy
You're just the jump-off
I'm his breezy
I'm the one who knows him the best
I'm his one and only, nothin less
You don't wanna take it there
Don't you see
He told me he loves me
Calls me his breezy

Let me break it down, break it down
I got it on lock and
I think you better stop
I heard you been checkin for my boo
Who do you think he is, busy giving your best shot
But you couldn't get a call back
And even after all that
Caught you at the mall for a throwback
That's big pimpin but you
Wouldn't listen, he's mine
Not yours better fall back

I get shoppin sprees off the heezy (Off the heezy)
I get dough to blow, please believe me (Please believe me)
Don't want the one on one
Take it easy
You're just the jump-off
I'm his breezy
I'm the one who knows him the best
I'm his one and only, nothin less
You don't wanna take it there
Don't you see
He told me he loves me
Calls me his breezy (I'm his breezy)

Now I'mma let ya know to your face
You needa hit the brakes
Your about to make a major mistake
I'm gonna call you out, no doubt
Let me spell it out
Baby you ain't nothin but a FAKE
Cause I know what you want
And you ain't gotta front
So go ahead and pull another stunt
Remember that it's me that he loves
All he's thinkin of
I'm the only one that he wants

I get shoppin sprees off the heezy
I get dough to blow, please believe me
Don't want my one on one
Take it easy
You're just the jump-off
I'm his breezy
I'm the one who knows him the best
I'm his one and only, nothin less
You don't wanna take it there
Don't you see
He told me he loves me
Calls me his breezy

Cause what we have is so real 
It's more than just dollar bills 
This livin lavish 
Wouldn't matter if I didn't have his heart 
Sorry shorty, he's mine
Better luck next time
?? you can have it
But I'll still be his girl

I get shoppin sprees off the heezy
I get dough to blow, please believe me
Don't want my one on one
Take it easy
You're just the jump-off
I'm his breezy
I'm the one who knows him the best
I'm his one and only, nothin less
You don't wanna take it there
Don't you see

"event","I love Danny. Four pages in my notebook say that! I've known the boy since I was in diapers but I never knew that it'd turn out to be something more. We've been dating for a total of 7 months. I'm not even depressed over Erik any more! You see that Erik? I love Danny so you can go on fucking all of the girls in our old school! I don't care! Danny said he's buying me flowers, cards, candies, ballons and a big teddy for Valentine's Day! My 1st Valentine's Day with the guy I love! I don't know what to get him though! Lmao! You should she the ring he got me for christmas. Its REAL gold with this baby blue heart shaped diamond! Its a beautiful ring. My mum and dad love Danny and this summer he's taking me to Sweden with him. Now we just have to get through my parents. They'll probably say yes. My stepdad called my mum last night and said he wants he back. Hey fuck you Mark, my mum gave you the chance to stop hurting me but you didn't listen so FUCK OFF! Ok some of you may not know what I'm talking about coz I'm new. My mum and my real father got back together after my stepdad continued to beat me! Can you believe that sick fuck wants my mum back?! I'm about to castrate his ugly ass. If theres one mistake my mum ever made in her life, it was marrying that physco and even she admits that! Lmao! Well I should go. I'm in school and I haven't even touched my pencil yet! Mr. Benson is just staring at me like: Get to work LeighLynn Elizabeth! I'm outtie shorties!

"event","blah.

Last night I had the wierdest dreams and I kept waking up.  Each time I woke up, I was really cold, and then really comfortable.  I have to say it was the wierdest sleeping experience I've had in a while.

Today I babysat Tyler all day from 10 till now...I still am.  I really need the money.

It has been a wierd couple of days.  I am really glad that I don't have to go to school.  I am sick of my softball games getting rained out.  I want to play more tennis.  I need my parents to get off their asses and sign my up for my driving test, which should have been done so long ago.  

I need a job, but don't want to get one.  I wanted this summer to be a relaxing one, but I need money.

Oh blah.

Thats all for now."

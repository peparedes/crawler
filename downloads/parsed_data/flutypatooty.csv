"event","So yesterday was an awful lot of fun. (And for once, I'm not being sarcastic in the least - felt the need to clarify, sometimes these things don't come across online). It began when I rolled out of bed at 9 (what IS it with me and actually sleeping all of a sudden?) so I could have my riding lesson on my Moose. It was wonderful to actually have a lesson again, and I was SO looking forward to riding. Unfortunately, my lovely horse had different ideas. He threw me off within the first five minutes, then proceeded to throw Jenn of as well. Not good. We have a lot of work to do in that area, stupid winter with no stupid indoor riding ring. >8-0. But anyways that still could've been worse...no one was hurt!

After riding and playing my flute I had about 45 minutes for me to eat, shower, and pack for Sarah's birthday party. I ran out the door about three times - the first time I forgot her gift, the second time I forgot swimsuit and the third time I realized it would probably benefit to actually wear some shoes for once. So I arrived fashionably late to Sarah's party and was still the second person there. Go me. 

So the party was tons of fun! All of us there are total and complete Disney nerds, so we played the Disney edition of Scene It. Of course, none of us really has an attention span that lasts more than 15 minutes, especially on vacation, so shortly after beginning the game we went to the pool. It was sooooo nice. Have I mentioned how much I love summer?? While we were swimming, this kid kept following us around. He told us his name and stated proudly that he was 13 and three quarters, then asked if we watched the Cartoon Network. So he was our little fish for the entire afternoon at the pool; he followed us everywhere. But he was nice enough and obviously lonely, so what could we do about it? I also ran into my friends who apparently life guards at the pool whom I haven't seen for about 2 or 3 years, so that was good too :-). When we got back from swimming we tie-tyed shirts and hung around, and ate tons of food. It was all delicious, I must say. We also decided to be incredibly cool and stick confetti all over our faces - you should see some of the pictures of Liz. (If you're connected to my Facebook account, you will, mwahahahaha). 

Iman and I spent the night, with the total intention of having a Broadway marathon. We watched Grease (btw, what kind of ending is THAT?? Ir ruined the movie. And I'm still singing ""Summer Lovin'"", it's getting kind of old) then Iman crashed around midnight. Sarah had to get up at 4:30 this morning to start her guarding shift at the pool, so at that point she and I just decided to...not go to sleep. At all. So we watched more musicals, and hours of Smallville. (Again, have I mentioned how much I love vacation??? I can just let my brain completely blank and I don't have to worry about studying!!!). At 4:30 we went down to the kitchen and made breakfast, then Iman and I went with Sarah's mom and aunt to the 5:30 am spin class at the club. (Yes, I know.) It was actually really fun, and a really good workout. The class ended at 7, then we swam for two hours.

By the time we got back to Sarah's house we were kinda blahhh but functioning perfectly well, so we watched the Phantom of the Opera (how many times have I seen this now? I LOVE THAT MOVIE although the Phantom needs to meet Dr. Kempster. Wicked badly.) and covered ourselves in henna. This was also really fun. Then we just kinda crashed until I came home.

So here I am, after being awake for 36 hours. It was quite fun, there are so many much more entertaining things to do then sleep. If I'm awake, I'm awake forever. If I'm asleep, I'll sleep like a dead person until someone basically hits me over the head to wake me up. So that's my story! YAY!"

So basically, I'm learning almost as much over summer vacation as I did this past schoolyear. Of course, this may have been because I really didn't pay that much attention in school this year, but we won't go there. ():-) Just for kicks and giggles, here are some words to the wise. 

1) When your dad goes to Japan for 16 days with the intent of leaving you home in Cowtown, secretly buy yourself a ticket and go with him. 
2)When you can quote Black Beauty while you're watching it, it's time to put in another movie.
3) Don't let your mom do your laundry. She'll dye all of your white bras and tank tops blue by accident :p.
4) De-frizzifying conditioner really does work, and makes your hair much more managable.
5) Before you buy a bikini, make sure you have enough confidence in your body-image to wear it in public.
6)Les Miserables is an undeniably enjoyable book, but the music is undeniably more enjoyable. The reason being the musical does not spend 200 pages describing a character that makes a very brief appearance in the story.
7) Having a DVD player in your room is dangerous.
8) While you may find it perfectly fun to sing your way throughout the entire Phantom of the Opera, chances are your mom and brother will disagree.
9) If you don't wake up until noon, you won't be able to fall asleep until at least 1 in the morning.
10) When a three year old starts panting because he thinks you're pretty, it's time to go muck a stall...or something.
11) If your dogs are running all over your property, it means they've learned how to push open the basement door.
12) Bring your swim suit every time you go over to Pravi's or Keith's. That way you won't have to borrow Priya's. 
13)If someone from camp two years ago calls you and says ""Hey do you remember me???"" say no. The reason why you remember them is because they drove you nuts. 
14) Kitten poop is not a pleasant surprise in your riding boots.
15) There is a long list movies that is awkward to watch with guys, whether they're your friends, boyfriend, or crush. Most of these movies are sketchy perv movies, chick flicks, or anything with a sex scene in it. BS is a much more suitable activity.

Okay, I'm going to go write letters to my friends or something. Fun stuff! Happy Summer!"

"event","So.

This morning I rolled my lazy butt out of bed at 9, stretched and looked out the window. What a wonderfully bright and happy morning! And of course, I had oh so much to do. I had to muck stalls and do all the horsey stuff as well as other stuff. However, this was interrupted when dear Salem (my beloved black cat) needed a trip to the kitty ER. His paw had swollen to literally three times its normal size. This of course, was NOT GOOD. So we brought him to the kitty ER where we waited for 2 and a half hours in the kitty waiting room. I kid you not. 2 and a half hours!!! The poor cat was basically dying of pain, and I was dying of boredom and impatience. We were FINALLY brought into an examination room where we waited another 20 minutes, then finally, a vet appeared! (So much for ER, huh? My cat could have been dead by that point!) So the vet did all the vet-type things...I'll spare you the details of puncturing the absess and draining it. Then we went home. 4 and half hours later. ARGH I don't like veterinarians. And THEN (small world) I realized that the girl who was interning as the receptionist actually boarded her horse at our farm last summer. She didn't recognize us though (I think. I hope.) so that wasn't as interesting as it could've been. But yeah, that's my story. And then I found a pickle!

On a completely different note, I have come to the conclusion that most of my friends are either at camp, in Europe, somewhere in the US that's NOT Massachusetts, on a circus tour, or vacationing in Aruba. Honestly. I mean, I'm incredibly jealous of all these people because a)I wasn't allowed to go back to camp this summer because it wasn't ""as educational as [my parents] had hoped"" and b)I have never left the continent and would LOVE to be somewhere interesting and/or tropical. Not that I'm complaining or anything - I mean I'm totally fine with relaxing for the first time since last August and doing my horse thing (Amen) but honestly, why does everyone else get to go off and have fun? No offense to my 4th new town or anything, but Lancaster isn't exactly a party spot. And I don't know anyone. But oh well. At least ONE of you had better bring me back a tan!!!

I also had a wonderful ride on my beloved Moose tonight, but since most of you aren't familiar with most of the lingo I would use, I'll spare you the boredom. But it made me happy!

Peace."

"event","Hola Amigos,

Today, June 26, 2006 marks the day that I can OFFICIALLY place sophomore year behind me. (It also marks the day that, exactly one year ago, we moved from our Boxborough house. I was oh so naiive and still somewhat optimistic then). So maybe I should try to be cheery and say that this year wasn't so bad. Really, there were some awesome times, like sledding down the Year of Graduation hill from the tennis courts during our midterms. Hanging out with my friends, whether it's 6:30 in the morning and at school or 1:30 in the morning and at someone's house is always awesome. For future reference, Vinny T's puts some incredibly mystifying ingredient in their garlic bread...:/. ""Priya if this wasn't a fancy restaurant I would THROW THIS AT YOU!"" ""Hey, who wants to join the Vinny T's e-club?"" ""Sup, my homefry?"" ""Whoooosh - hey look! A chandelier!"". (Sadly enough, this was all in one evening.) I also found my wonderful sisterhood, and made some incredibly close friends this year, all of whom I love dearly. Pep band is always a good time, and oh dear. Our chaperone. And there were other...certain time periods, that I'm not trying to forget either. 

Sooooo my grades suck. It's okay though, I'll just work twice as hard next year. And I've lived in 5 houses in the past year. That's okay, too. We're done moving. My flute playing seriously declined...but I have all summer to practice for Senior District auditions. Whatever depression phases I went through are gone...hopefully. With my friends...well, I'm going to miss all the graduating seniors an unbelievable amount, but maybe being an upperclassmen will allow me to find my place again. And the major, MAJOR part of my life that I missed all year this year (my riding) is going to start up again and Jenn's going to help me. (YAY!) So I can take all of the crappy parts of sophomore year, roll them up in a blanket, and throw them away. And forget about them. Start over next year. And as I said, there definitely were good times, so I just have to be careful to not throw those away as well.

So now it's summer vacation. It's a really relaxing feeling, but I'm already relatively bored (haha, typical me. If I'm not constantly doing something, I go nuts). Soooo if you are not on vacation or at camp or doing any kind of family thing and feel like hanging out, you know who to call. I don't live THAT far away...I mean, I could live in Australia or something. Actually ,that would be really cool. Then I could eat Vegemite and talk with an incredibly entertaining accent, and everyone would call me ""Sheila"". On second though, maybe I'll stick with goold ol' New England.

Apparently, ""incredibly"" is my new word of the week. I need a different one. But now I'm going to go write to Lydia at Smirkus, so I'll have to think of one later. And I'll honestly try to keep my LiveJournal updated now that I don't have a MySpace. Happy Summer ya'll!"

"event","Wow...so a lot to say, but not sure exactly how much of it I want to say. I'm definitely leaving some things out, but I feel for the need of my stress relief I'm going to...contemplate and reflect on this past week. 

So yeah, this week basically just dragged on and on with nothing going right. I know what you're thinking...""There were only 3 days of school! How could it be stressful?"" Trust me, it can be, and if anyone knows how to make a vaguely stressful situation an extremely stressful situation, it's the Dentino family. I know everybody has their bad .... weeks but it gets to be kind of a bummer. I'm at the point where I would really enjoy just curling up in a bed (away from here) pulling the covers over my head, and staying there for a long, long time. And also, to make things even sadder, my horse is lame and can't be ridden for a couple of days while I'm doctoring him :-( But tomorrow brings a new day...(haha, I've been saying that all week, but maybe this one will be true)

*Note to Keith ... I'm going to quote you now* So while I was sitting on the vent with Rachy and Keith the other day, Rachy and I were talking about what a week it's been, and how humiliated I was by my Senior District pre-aud (which, btw, I am NOT going to get into a discussion about) when Keith said, ""Wow. It must really suck to care that much"". And I was kinda like....huh. Never looked at it like that before. And the thing is...it does really suck to care so much. I mean seriously, it's like my brain is on overdrive about EVERYTHING. I worry soooo much about everything I do, everything I attempt, my friends...so on and so forth. I try to relax but it's not exactly in my nature to do so. I would love to just let somethings slide every now and then, but I don't let go. Maybe I'll realize in due time that some things aren't as important as they seem now, and there are much bigger problems in the world. I mean, tonight I actually did something not work related (the Japanese reception/pot luck dinner) and enjoyed interacting with people that had no idea what I was saying. If you think about it, we could be living in Pakistan, or even down south in the US right now."

So currently I am practicing my extreme procrastinating skills and blogging, of course. But, I believe I deserve a reprieve because I took four tests today - one B block, C block, D block, and after school. BLAH! But whatever, I'm in a surprisingly plucky mood. (Haha, Guy, the Plucky Comic Relief)OK, never mind.

So....I have officially been in the 30 minute grace period of the Game ALL FREAKING DAY (it was ridiculous - EVERYONE was talking about the game.)It was awesome. I'm talking on the phone right now with Rachael and Priya and I have no idea what I'm typing so BYE! *Like I said, procrastinating*"

Let's see....sophomore year is turning out to be about the same as freshman year, only I like the subjects better. I love history, Spanish, and English so those are the same, I HATE BIO omg, and Algebra 2 is tons better than Geometry. I have Mr.Zellner for US History though, and everyone laughs when I say that, but he seems like a decent enough teacher...now I just have to be afraid of his tests. Or maybe not, maybe everyone's bluffing. HA! I always knew there was a conspiracy against me!!!! 

So the first day of school, Becca and her parents took me to a Red Sox game! It was my first Sox game ever and I was like WOOHOOO!!! Which means that I had to get my 3 HOURS OF HOMEWORK ON THE FIRST DAY done before 6. Woohoo! But either way it was tons of fun!

I, like everyone else in the school, am already rather overwhelmed and COMPLETELY loaded with homework. I have hours every night, then riding and music stuff and I get no sleep but whatever because I would have no idea what to do with myself if I had free time. I'd probably sit online and write in my blog. Like right now. 

So yeah I'm sick and wasn't in school today and am procrastinating on my make-up work. And talking to people because I missed my socialesness today! Well, at least tomorrow's friday and there's a pep band game so I can have fun and get even SICKER! YES! And Dawson, if you read this we're going to have to put our Loudest Class of 2008er competition on Hold because I can't talk!

"event","Okay, so today I went up to New Hampshire with my trainer, brother, and mom to test ride some horses for our farm and my trainer's lesson program, and it was tons of fun, and very successful. I would talk about all the horses I rode, but I don't think anyone really wants to read a detailed description of every transition and exercise and blah blah blah that I did, so I'll get to the point.

One thing you need to know is that this farm was about an hour and half away from my house. So after riding my last horse, I took off my helmet (it's flipping HOT!! This black velvet show helmet which I LOVE but it has no ventilation at all and I basically die), hosed off my horse and put her back in her stall. I then promptly got into my car and went home. After discussing all of my rides and the possibilities of a lesson horse, about 15 minutes away from home (1.25 hours away from the farm) I realized...hey, where's my helmet? Then ... CRAP I LEFT IT IN THE FRIGGIN HAY WAGON IN NH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is NOT GOOD!! Each helmet is about $100, and this is my fourth one (thanks to Brownie, I've cracked my previous 3 schooling helmets) so I call the people in New Hampshire. This lady says she saw it a few hours ago and if she finds it she'll mail it to me and blah blah blah. I really, really hope she finds it (I don't have a hundred bucks!!!!) and I hope I get it SOON cuz I can't ride without it. I don't have a spare and riding without a helmet is as stupid as drunk driving. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGHHH I would forget my head if it wasn't attached to me, sheesh."

"event","This is really sad...it's the end of August ALREADY??? You've gotta be kidding me, I just finished my finals, didn't I?? This summer went by way too fast...which I guess is only fitting because last year went by wicked fast, too. So I was sitting out on the dock today *most likely getting sunburned* when I looked over the lake and went- wait, it's really quiet here. Then it hit me that it's the end of August, and all the vacationers (who would be vacationing on Lake Shirley in Massachusetts is beyond me) have gone home, which means hardly any jet-skis or boats. While it's much more peaceful to not hear boats at 6:30 every morning, it also then hit me that the summer is coming to end, and I really haven't used the advantages of vacation. I can't believe I got home from camp almost three weeks ago, that's crazy. I haven't been to a single beach, and I've been up at 7 practically every morning so I can go ride 3 horses and do my barn chores. At least I've been able to see some friends, including some friends from my old barn and old school. 
It's also just kind of hitting me that the senior class isn't going to be at school anymore...this is also not good, or fair. While I'm looking forward to school starting (get me out of this cabin PLEASE!!!!) I'm not looking forward to the workload, or noticing the absence of some really close friends. I honestly have no idea as to how this year is going to turn out - sophomores are kind of forgotten about in the ranks of high school, aren't we? I'll just have to make sure I don't get lost in the ""slumps"", it doesn't sound like a fun place to be. I hope Algebra 2 is better than Geometry, and that I get a good history teacher. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to wait and see. Why do I always get so stressed at the end of August??? I guess I'm just that nerdy."

So I was just sitting here eating dinner, minding my own business when the animal comes out of my ""room"" with my favorite, most comfortable pair of flip flops in his mouth!!!! One was saved but I'm missing practically the entire heel of my left sandal, thanks to it being in Diesel's stomach. GRRRRR and what if I don't have $15 to spend on 'trivial' things, such as flip flops?? Now I'm really mad, I would love for Diesel to start to grow up, seeing as he's over a year old and STILL flippin orally fixated.

Secondly, I'm really excited because all of my hours of riding and training are finally starting to pay off!!!! I'm going to use as much of the rest of this show season as I can to get used to jumping 2'0''-2'6'' courses and entering canter classes. Next season we're going to work toward the New England Equitation division and Finals, I can't wait!!! I got Brownie two years ago, and it was disasterous for a long time. Every single day he would spook and bolt and buck at least 4 times, I've fallen off of him 8 times, he accidentally bit and kicked me, he knocked me over and ran over me, he bucked and bolted, didn't know how to carry himself properly, canter, or jump - it was nuts. Then once he learned how to canter, he would buck whenever you aksed him to go or whenever he got tired. After two years of riding at least 5 days a week, practicing and lessons, blood, sweat, tears, MRI's, xrays, bone scans, and 4 (count them - 4) new helmets, we're finally getting it together!!! We can jump 3 feet, we have Marshall& Sterling as a possibility in our future, and we're in training level dressage! Sure, it's only training level but it's better than introductory (once we won Introductory Dressage Champion, my coach decided we could move up, lol even though we're doing a lot more Hunter classes than dressage tests) and we're doing a lot! SO yay for Brownie!!!

"event","Hey Everyone!

So let's see..what have I been up to...riding!!! But last night I slept over at Jess's house and it was really cool. We were in her pool until dinner, and by that time we were total prunes. After dinner we got to showers (yes, the Beckstrom's let me use their shower - as in, hot water that doesn't smell like a pond! YAY!) and then we watched The Day After Tomorrow. Very good movie! It made me really, really, cold to watch it though. Either that or the air conditioning was up high. So yeah I had tons of fun, and Jess if you're reading this, thanks again!

Today when Jess and I got to my barn, my coach came out to tell me that we had (if you can believe it) even more kittens. We have 2 cats and 4 3-month-old kittens and today, Smokey (who is a stray cat that has adopted our barn) had given birth to 4 kittens. They are so tiny they look like mice! The thing is, Smokey isn't a very good mother AT ALL and won't let them nurse, so my coach and her husband were trying to get them to feed from a baby animal bottle. The thing is, adorable as they are, we already have 6 cats, 2 dogs, and 7 horses (2 are ours, 5 are boarders) so if anyone wants a free kitten, you can get dibs on them now! I think 3 are still up for grabs.

I only had time to school 1 horse today as opposed to 2 or 3, so I rode Fantasy since I haven't ridden her in about 2 days. She's a really good pony, but has these really annoying habits of a pony who has forgotten all of her schooling. She is very surefooted, but doesn't pay attention so she trips all over the place. She get's really heavy on the forehand so I constantly have to remind her to pick herself up and hold her with my abs. When she transitions into the canter, she runs into it from the trot which is an extremely bad habit and horribly uncomfortable to sit. When she jumps, she has a very nice pony jump, but she either a) runs toward the next one or b) pops it terribly. When Fantasy pops, she snaps up the middle of her back so I'm shot right out of the saddle. She did this to me twice in 5 minutes before I left for camp. Then after a fence, if she jumps nicely, she keeps pulling down farther and farther and doesn't come back up, so it's very difficult to get out of my two point. If you're not balanced, she'll pull you right off of her. She's a very strong pony for 14 hands. So yeah it's actually kind of fun to train her, but I would definitely choose my Moose! 

OKay so my mom wants the computer (what?? I have to get off?? Oh. I've been on for two hours. Whoops.) so I'm done. TTYL!"

"event","Okay, I'm back! I got home from SYMS on Saturday and I'm still sleep deprived. I had way too much fun at camp, I didn't want to come home! Let's see how much I can re-cap before my fingers fall off from typing.

My friends and I had a posse of about a dozen people that we hung out with 24/7. The first week of camp was intense (actually, they both were intense) but it was soooooo long. I made Symphonic Band (#2 out of 4 leveled bands...me being me was, of course, disappointed that I wasn't in Honors Band), took a flute masterclass, mixed choir, women's choir, and musical theater. I got up at 5:30 every morning, had classes from 8-3:45, and went to bed around 11:00 or 11:30 pm after our evening concerts or activities. The teachers were fantastic, the classes were a lot of fun and extremely educational, and during our free time in the afternoons my friends and I laughed so hard. The dorm that Lexi and I shared was Party Central - if us girls were inside the dorms, we were all crammed into room 205. We ate a lot of candy, read pointless magazines, and listened to music. We also went downtown a few times, and even though we had access to the swimming pools, and volleyball and tennis courts, we never had to make it down there.

My favorite director was Dr. Kempster, my choir director (closely followed by Mr. Orovich, my band director). Kempster is Australian and constantly makes fun of the American accent, it is SO hilarious. He insulted us multiple times daily, but it was all in good nature and inspired us to work harder. He called the sopranoes ""dying ferrets"" the altos ""a rare form of cattle"" and gave the tenors and basses credit for ""having balls"". People in my choir had pages full of ""Kempster Quotes"" and it was so worth it to be in his class. I learned a lot and he put together an excellent program - Kempster rocks. 

We had a couple of dances at camp, too. At the first one, the DJ was relatively sucky and played nothing but monotonous hip-hop music that you couldn't dance to and all sounded the same. That dance was outside and it was really, really hot but pretty fun nontheless. The second dance was on our last night and (since there were predicted thunderstorms) was inside a relatively small room, which was air-coditioned but still wicked hot. This DJ was much better, played better and more fun songs and took a lot of requests. That dance was kind of sad because it was our last night and no one wanted to go home. OH and get this - my friends basically tied me down and straightened my hair, making it look really long. It was so weird, and THEN they had me borrow their clothes so I was more ""appropriately dressed"" for a dance - which means, less appropriately dressed than I usually am. Lexi, Elise, Christina, Patrice, Sam, Jess, Krista...if you're reading this I got the pictures back...

Let's see, our music selection...
In Women's Choir, we sang four pieces: Ladaumus Te, Dirait Ton, If You Were Coming in the Fall, and The Storm Is Passing Over. The Storm is Passing Over was a gospel and my favorite piece. In Mixed Choir we sang Die Himmel Eh Zehrlen Die Ehre Gottes (German...don't know what it means) and a medley from Miss Saigon. In band we played a short fanfare called Cenotaph, the Prologue from West Side Story, and Of Sailors and Whales. The fifth movement of OSAW was definitely the most exciting and most fun piece to play. 

So that's camp in a nutshell...if I think of anything else I want to say I'll post it. Chances are I'll be talking about camp until next summer. Speaking of, 11 months, 9 days until SYMS '06 (thanks for the countdown, Brendan!).

Oh yeah...and you'd think that I would have a few days off to catch up on sleep, right? Nope, I rode Brownie the night I got home, Fantasy yesterday, and Brownie again today. I guess that's what happens when you're horse crazy and registered for a show every week for the rest of the summer. Yay!"

"event","The night before band camp,
and what do I do...
I go online - wouldn't you?
Packing? It's done,
Practicing? No way!
I'm gone for two weeks - 
I'm going away!

Wowwww I'm tired. To prove my point more? Here are some things that I found online that definitely apply to me and my Italian side of the family

You Know You're Italian When...
On Christmas Eve you eat only fish
(seriously, that's what my family eats...not just fish but ""bacala"" - fish and tomato soup. I personally stick to the oil and garlic spaghetti)
""Fuhggettaboutit""
(I can't even COUNT how many times my father has said that to me)
You love Nutella...anytime...
(Nutella?? OH YUM!!! Too bad my mom insists it's not nutritious...)
Your nonna's meat balls are the best
(Grammy Dentino's meatballs...enough said)
You always dress to impress
(Auditions? Yeah, always in a skirt.)
Guys gotta respect their women...or else...
(I don't believe this needs a comment. But I guess I just commented anyway :/ )
You've been hit with a wooden spoon or had a shoe thrown at you by either your mother or your nonna.
(My mom hits my butt with a wooden spoon every time I walk by her while she's cooking. Sometimes it's plastic and hurts more.)
You consider dunking a cannoli in an espresso a nutritious breakfast.
(Okay so I'm not the biggest fan of espresso, but cannolis DEFINITELY deserve their own food group)
If someone in your family grows beyond 5'11"", it is presumed his mother had an affair.
(Yeah. My brother's 5'10'', my dad's 5'9'', I'm 5'1'' and my mom's 4'10''.)
It is impossible for you to talk with your hands in your pockets.
(It drives me as well as others crazy, but I talk with my hands. And fidgit.)

So yeah I leave at 7:15 tomorrow morning for 2 weeks of music camp. It's actually not as bad as it sounds...I'm actually wicked excited. It's cool to be with a bunch of music nerds during the summer, and surprisingly enough, a lot of people there have heard of CCHS' Concert Band. My riding musceles are going to be completely soft by the time I get home, and then I have a show the following weekend - I'm not going to be able to stay on! (I actually fell off of Fantasy twice yesterday, but that's besides the point.) Okay, going to go over my checklist then go to sleep. Hope everyone's having a great vacation!"

See, Lexi, my roomie, and I have too much fun together! I'm so looking forward to this it's SAD!!! I'm listening to last year's concert CD's and re-living the 2004 experience, lol. I think this year we have access to the tennis courts...and maybe I can suck up to a counselor and get them to take me down to the stables and equestrian center...MWAHAHAHAHA! Unfortunately I play one of the most competitive instruments so entering Sr SYMS in the youngest age groups I might not audition well...but it'll still be fun. I hope my teachers are as good as they were last year, I LOVED Mr. Rush he was the man. I'm SO decorating my dorm this year too - my side is going to be covered in pix of horses and my friends and Brownie, lol. I bet Lex's side is covered with pix of...Ewan McGregor? LOL lylas Lexi! Maybe this year's dance won't suck *but it probably will. I'm not much of a ""dance-outing"" type of girl*. So yeah you should all come to my final concerts on August 6 because you know you want to spend 2 hours in the car driving to New Hampshire, hear my concerts and drive 2 hours back to Massachusetts...LOL.

Are you still the same 
Or did you change somehow
What do you do 
At this very moment when I think of you 

And when I'm looking back 
How we were young and stupid 
Do you remember that 

No matter how I fight it, can't deny it
Just can't let you go 

I still need you 
I still care about you 
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you like I'm right beside you 
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on, not refuse to see
That I keep coming back 
yeah, I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last

I've tried to fight it, can't deny it
You don't even know that 

I still need you 
I still care about you 
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you like I'm right beside you 
But still no word from you

No, No...
I wish I could find you
Just like you found me, that I
Would never let you go

(need you, care about you)
Though everything's been said and done, yeah
I still feel you (I still feel you)
like I'm right beside you (Like I'm right here beside you)

But still no word from you


Another song...
Everybody knows
That I was such a fool
To ever let go of you
But baby I was wrong
And yeah I know I said
We'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart
I didn't mean to break your heart
But baby, here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride's spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth
And now I'm crawling back to you
I know you're in there
And you can make me wait
But I'm not gonna wait
This is the least that I can do
Just is to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself
Now I'm dying in this hell
Girl, I know you're mad
I can't blame you for being mad
But baby, here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride's spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And now I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth
And now I'm crawling back to you
If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Heal my heart that's heavily bleeding
You would see a different man
But baby, here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride's spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance

Now I'm crawling back to you (Crawling back to you)
Crawling back to you (Crawling back to you)

And another.......
Oh no
Take what you need
Cuz I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel
Cuz I've got nothing left
Oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gunna keep it if it's wrong or right
And if I lose it all
There'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall
'Coz no way you are out there
Breathing in someone that I follow
It's a chance I'll take even if I break
And I'll lose it all
If I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway
Don't change then
A thing that you want
Time pass away
Time is all I've got
If my heart still tried watching you
There'll be one less thing I have to do
And if I lose it all
There'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall
'Coz no way you are out there
Breathing in someone that I follow
It's a chance I'll take even if I break
And I'll lose it all
If I lose it all
And have you will be waiting when
I fall in too younglow to get it out
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there
And if I lose it all
There'd be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall
'Coz no way you are out there
Breathing in someone that I follow
It's a chance I'll take even if I break

Of course.

Soooo many jokes, goodness. You laugh even more frequently than I do. So you see, Rachael has um...discovered another use for popcorn. Quite fascinating, I must say. So then we're at the scene in Star Wars Episode 3 where you see Anakin's eyes turn red and seeing him turn all evil; it's really quite a sad part in the play...but Rachael started laughing. And laughing. And laughing. So everyone was like ""What the heck is so funny?"" and Rachael said ""Popcorn"". Only I understood...oh yes. The popcorn. Who knew food could be so funny?

Then Rachael went on to say how everyone in Star Wars was either or disturbing, except for (in her opinion) Anakin and Yoda. So of course, Yoda is now attractive. Then Yoda got into his spaceship and flew away to Yodaville, land of the Hotties.

Let's see, what else...oh yes. Rachael took a chunk out of her leg by scratching it with a pillow. But I think one of the best things is that our experiences tonight prove girls have way more fun - Ravi, Alec, and Mike had no idea what was so funny. They still don't. And neither do you, so yup yay for dorky girls! Good night!"

So it's 4:10 pm on the Saturday of Memorial Weekend. I've been doing homework ALL DAY and now I only have math left, and studying. LOTS of studying. But whatever, I can afford a break, right? So I was going to practice my flute and then I realized...I can't find my music folder!! This is not good seeing as it contains the music for graduation, regular band, and my audition pieces for band camp. Last night I brought it to Central Catholic High School when a bunch of us from Concord Carlisle went to play for Mr. Sobchenko, and I could've sworn I brought it home. Maybe it's at school? Maybe it's on the bus?? (NOT GOOD) I don't know and I'm sure this is very dull so let me change the topic.

Okay...as I said last night I played at Central Catholic's graduation with (let's see if I can name everyone there) Rachael, Andrea, Liz, Keith, Danny, Kirill, Mike, Luke, Greg, Alec, Ari, Stephan, Ryan, Walter, and Adam. Woo hoo! When we weren't playing Mr. S let us go outside in the parking lot and get some fresh air for a bit. This was the time where Liz and Keith decided to make fun of me...omg it was so hilarious! I also succeeded in COMPLETELY humiliating myself. Oh well, it was fun all the same, and I got 7 hours of community service (like I need it) and a $20 gift certificate to Strawberries. While Mr. S was buying us the gift cards, a bunch of the guys ran next door to Joyce Chen and Mike bought a couple of huge bags of the 'unfortunate' fortune cookies. We had so much fun eating them (I swear I had around 15) then reading all of the messed up fortunes. Rachael and I played with my cell phone and Andrea and I pranked called each other - we must have been really bored seeing as both of us have caller ID. 

ANYWAYS I'd better get back to work...ttyl!"

My mom's taking me to Strawberries this week so I can use my giftcard, and I want to buy Gavin Degraw's CD. For those of you who haven't heard, he performed at AB last week, for AB students only. NOT FAIR! I totally USED to go to AB I should've been allowed to go...LOL. Oh well, not like I'm going to die from it or whatever. My friends said ""See you should've stayed at AB"" but I really don't think that would've been a good idea. Oh well.

I was supposed to go to a show with Moose, and Jess on Beans but that didn't work out thanks to some people that I won't mention...so now I have to wait until the next one, which will hopefully be before June.

Hmmmmmmmm I don't really know what to say. I never know what to say. So why do I even have a LiveJournal then one may ask? Basically because it's fun, and I'm good at rambling and sometimes I have nothing better to do, like when I leave my flute at school or am waiting to study until after dinner. So there.

64 more days until camp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SYMS here I come OMG I can't wait!!! I can't decide what courses I want to take, there are so many ... I'm thinking concert band, wind ensemble, flute choir, musical theater, master class, chorus, and maybe something else. I can't wait to see some of my campies again (Lex, you and I are going to have WAY too much fun) and I can't wait to set up my dorm this time...actually make it look like someone's living there. Okay, so while waking up at 5:30 am in the summer to go to 6-8 hours of rehearsals a day may not seem appealing to SOME people, it really is a lot more fun than it sounds. The people are great, the food is delicious, the courses are excellent, and it puts even MORE auditions and concerts under my belt. One can never have enough! Hopefully the dance will be more fun this year...it really sucked last year. Most dances do. But whatever.

Anyways, I'm gonna go cuz I'm running out of things to say. See ya laterrrrrrrrr"

Don't get me wrong - I LOVE school (I'm not even being sarcastic - I really do love school and being at CCHS, having something to work for and seeing all my friends) But the workload is getting kind of old, ya know? So tonight I worked for 3.5 consecutive hours (I didn't have much hw) I finished it all before 6:30. Then I didn't ride tonite because my mom doesn't feel to hott, so I had a night off! I practiced and was online basically all night because DUH I totally have a life. 

So, nice relaxing evening right? WRONG! Stephan, you are horrible! See, Stephan Wu finds it fun to torment me. And torment me. And make me spaz out.

"event","Hmmm it's Sunday and once again I'm sitting on my butt, procrastinating until I go to my riding lesson. I'm kinda getting End-of-the-yearitis where I dont feel like working ALL WEEKEND and I have a tendency to leave EXTREMELY important things at home, such as my math project (argh I am SO stupid). Anyways, I think this coming week is the one with the screwed up schedule because of MCAS, right? I have the schedule written down somewhere, but I'll probably still wind up going to the wrong classes. I have a test on Chapter 10 in Geometry tomorrow and I still don't really get it...which means I should probably go study. Actually, Jess just IMed me so I'll go talk to her, THEN go study. ARGH see what I mean by procrastinating?!?!?!?!?"

"event","Hey Everyone!

I just got back from the semi half an hour ago and it was super duper fun!!! Despite the fact that there were some technical difficulties with my dress and my feet are KILLING me but I still had a great time. Priya, thanks for letting me borrow your dress, I got a lot of compliments on it! (Don't worry, I let everyone know it was yours and that I don't have enough fashion sense to go to a mall and buy a dress myself) and I looked like a girl, so of course my mom had to take pictures. Everyone looked so gorgeous, I filled up an entire disposable camera so I hope the pix come out. I had a lot of fun just dancing out wide in the open where everyone could look at me and be like ""What is her problem? She's dancing by herself in the middle of the caf"" - it was very amusing. I was introduced to a lot of people, and 3 people asked me, ""Do you go to CC?"" And I was like, yes, yes I do, thank you very much. I felt so noticed, LOL. Then when I told them I'm a freshman they asked me who I came with and I said ""Emily!!!"". It was awesome. And YES Margot there was tons of grinding and YES I was kinda shocked but hey I'm a prude, and a sheltered freshman, it's not exactly my fault. Anyways it's 12:15 am and I'm exhausted and getting up early to ride tomorrow, so I'd better catch some sleep. TTYL

"event","OMG I had a great lesson on Brownie last night! He was being kind of a dork in the beginning and wouldn't get off my leg and kept pulling me through the bridle, but that stopped after a little. After lots of trotting I took Brown over a teeny tiny crossrail and he actually JUMPED it which was very impressive. Then we cantered (this is a very big deal for Brownie and I - he's very green and just learning to canter like a normal horse) 2 laps in each direction, which I was ecstatic about, because he didn't break. Granted my trainer was threatening to chase Brownie and I around the ring with a lunge whip which is pretty intimidating but hey, it worked. 

We're showing in two weeks at MEC, come watch me show at walk-trot and crossrails! LOL. Brownie and I don't get to see the jumps until we take the course, so he's going to see the brightly colored flowers around the jumps and be like COWA BUNGA!!!!  OK yeah so technically if you're not a horseperson *yes one word* you don't really know what I'm talking about but that's ok. I'm going to go put on a DRESS *ew* and be turned into a girl so TTYL

"event","Hey All...

The first thing I have to say is TGIF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Argh this week went on FOREVER, I swear I don't think I slept at all. But whatever, despite crankiness and adrenaline highs I survived and it's FRIDAY!!!!!

I still don't really know what to say in these things...it's like I'm just talking about myself and I don't know what to talk about. Well...tonight I have a riding lesson, tomorrow night I'm going to the Sophomore Semi (yes I'm a freshman) with Emily which is going to be awesomely fun, and Friday I get to spend my day in Worcester. Woo hoo. I'm borrowing a dress from Priya for the semi and it's really, really pretty, but I'm going to feel so self-concious because I DON'T WEAR DRESSES!!!!! Argh I feel like such a girly girl, but whatever.

ANYWAYS I should probably do some student council duties.... there's a carwash for the CCHS class of 2008 that was SUPPOSED TO BE Saturday May 14. However, the 2008 6 Flags trip has been postponed to that date, so I don't know when the carwash is but PLEASE PLEASE come! We need all the help we can get, and I want some of my friends there. So yup I'm gonna go TTYL

"event","OK so I started using blogs when they added the ""notebook"" feature to sconex.com, so now I'm starting my own live journal. If I get spam and crap though, I'm deleting it. I don't really know what I'm going to be writing about seeing as I don't really have much to talk about, but whatever. Let's see....what can I say...

Well, for one thing my horse is awesome!!! My pride and joy even if he's still afraid of the dark. Whatever. We're showing this month too, so YAY.

And yeah, I'm kinda going crazy with the whole band thing. See, besides school band I do pep band in the fall, and then I played in Jr. District last month, I'm going to music camp this summer...and oh yeah, I have a rehearsal tonight for some OTHER group that my dad recruited me for. Hmm. I should probably go make some dinner before I go. THat would be a good idea. BYE!"

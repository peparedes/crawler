"event","Things that make me happy

Having a vase full of white lilies in November
Smelling cardamom pods on my hands after eating a curry
Driving in the rainy night
Watching Bing Crosby sing 'Snow, Snow' in front of the fire-- drinking my tea.
The feel of a new roll of TRS
An ice cold pint of guinness drunk while in a quiet pub with friends.
That you taste of smoke from a wood fire
Opening night

Things that make me sad

Missing people
That the happiest, most energetic show of the year pulling us down into such a deep hole.
I got attacked by a giant sesame seed on the cheeseburger, and my lip has a jagged iron-tasting cut on it that I've been chewing open all week.
My vans have a huge hole, and I can watch my toes wriggle.
Wanting it to be all right between us
Trying to make people smile, but instead just being told that I look tired.
Closing night"

"event","It bothers me more than you think.
How can a parent steal from a child?
How can they watch me curl up at night, knowing they're who caused it?

Why do they think I'll keep absorbing these goodbyes, until fat and bloated with sorrow, I sleep.

Tired. I want to learn, but I want to help them survive... 
I want to be eight again. Swinging on monkeybars, unafraid, running fast through long grass, proud that my feet are becoming tough. Proud of my nut brown skin.

What is the obsession with paleness? Dark shadows under eyes, like uncried tears. Illness and frailty is in fashion.

"event","Well, last night was interesting. Paige actually came over to meet the parents. Mum was, as she always is, my perfect hostess, cute mother. She pulled Paige into the kitchen by herself for a bit and left me with Dad. Dad. He was only pleasant after mum got him a bit sloshy. He kept making snide comments. I know how hard Christmas is, but just because I want to be happy and enjoy life doesn't mean that I'm forgetting Joby or that I'm being insensitive...does it? No. Definitely it doesn't. It makes me furious the way he makes me doubt myself. I guess that it was a fairly pleasant dinner.

The best part was definitely after Paige stole me away. She and I are official now!! I thought that was the best Christmas gift I could ever get, but then she went for round two. I definitely have to send Chase and Drake a huge Christmas present. Speaking of presents, Paige liked hers. I still can't believe how I had to go about getting hers.  Needless to say, I LOVE Christmas again."

"event","It been a while since I've written. Part of it was that I misplaced this, then there was the whole rush of getting used to being a Prefect, the biggest thing, was that I didn't really have much to write. Or if I did, it was mostly that I wanted to hurt Luke for hurting Paige. There's lots of stuff to write about today though.

Today, I'm eighteen. Alone and yet not.

Since the fire, I've hated birthdays. Loathed them about as much as I've hated Christmas. It's just another smack in the face of all the things that I used to share and now I'm forced to face alone. In fourth year, I started going to the most isolated place I could think of, the top of one of the towers. I'd found a loose floorstone there. Every year I would write him a letter of the things he missed, times I wanted him there, the letters sometimes wouldn't fit in the envelope. I'd always get a little gift too, something that is pretty flat, so no one knew that there was something under the stone. I'd light a candle and bring a cupcake for him and me. Yellow cake with chocolate frosting for me and chocolate cake with white frosting for him. I'd find a first year to give his to later. Tonight, I had Paige join me. I think Jobe would approve.

I'm writing this late into the night because I can just now write this all.

I got a birthday present. A dreamcatcher to keep the nightmares away. I hope so. I can't help but think when they come that he's mad. Mad that I'm here and he isn't. Mad that I threw away three years. Mad that I was the one who watched from the sidelines, and he, the player, is forced to watch now. It hurts. Worse than Dad's looks. More than knowing Ma still cries on our birthday if she thinks too hard (Dad tells me, how kind of him). That she cared enough to try to make my nights peaceful is more than enough but then she went and blew my mind completely.

She thinks she's falling in love.

With me. With. ME.

I still don't understand. A lot of the time, I don't even love myself. How can someone like HER love, even think about loving, ME. I'm so screwed up, she's so together.

What's worse...I couldn't even say that I felt the same way. I went completely and utterly stupid. I dribbled out some words as she walked away.

She thinks she loves me."

"event","Last night was...
Exciting, Encouraging, Warm, Perfect.

I thought the summer couldn't get cooler after getting the tattoo. It is nice to know that I have a symbol of Joby with me, on my right side til my dying day. It really does look like a bracelt with the coloring Apollo did and I can cover it up with a leather cuff I found in a shop in Diagon that has runes for luck and prosperity burned into it. Ma won't be the wiser for a long while, but I showed Da. He liked it, even showed me that he has Joby's name tattooed over his heart. It's nice to have something tying Da and I together.

All of that was blown away by last night. Paige got me to pop over a little after midnight. She dragged me into the woods to this little clearing where she made a fire and there was a blanket out. We tallked, asked each other questions. Wow. I loved it. She asked me why I liked her. I could have gone on for ages, I mean I have liked her since second year. Through Jabari, Daniel, and Luke. Even with all of that, she told me that she just wanted to be with me right then. She's not my girlfriend...I think she's too scared for that right now. That's all right. I can wait. What's a few more weeks, maybe a month or two?

Things got a little more exciting when we started to kiss. She stopped it before things went too far. No rushing. That's fine. I'm flattered that what happened happened. Floored by the fact that someone could get all flustered over me. Would have to control themselves from doing something like that with me. All right, maybe there was a part of me that was a bit disappointed, but not much. Not for long. Sometime it well, she said so and I think it will.



...Just glad one of us will know what they're doing."

"event","So, it's been a while. And for good reason. After going over to Paige's and going for that swim, I figured I would need to wait so I didn't just write BOOBS. MILKERS. SWEATER PUPPIES. I would like to think myself typically more articulate than that.

So, yes, there was some alcohol involved and we were a little...giggly. Still I don't think I made a huge fool out of myself. When I went home, though, I decided I was going to do something all out. Went to Da's liquor cabinet and found a bottle that didn't seem like it would be missed. Drank nearly the whole lot. Didn't even look to see what it was, all I know is that I didn't care about /anything/. Then, I started feeling sick and the room was spinning. I puked like there was no tomorrow and went to bed. Thankfully, mum and da were out of town visiting some distant relative who was sick. I now know what it's like to be drunk and know a horrible hangover first hand. Paige is right, summer is a time for evilness...and I am finding a new love and respect for that.

Stole a quick kiss from her today, and a bite of her ice cream cone, without anything other than my own pluck in me. That was nice.

Very nice."

"event","Well, it is now officially summer. I say that because it's well after midnight, the feast is over and in a few hours the train leaves. I have one year left here at Hogwarts. I don't know exactly how much I'll miss it in the future but I don't think I really will this summer.

I have a new favorite place. Well, it's tied for favorite with the old, neglected, hidden garden Joby and I used to run off to. The edge of the woods. Right there, where forbidden and dangerous things live just out of arms length. It's always seemed kind of an exciting place somewhere deep in myself. most people wouldn't guess though. I mean, poor little withdrawn Toby wouldn't ever want to go there, or so people think...I'm getting away from myself.

After all the hoopla about the feast, I needed out. Too many people, too much noise, the wanderlust hit me. I ended up by the forest and found a very, VERY upset Paige. Thankfully she was taking it out on a punching bag. (Is it bad that I felt bad for her and yet couldn't stop watching that? It was...wow?) Anyway, she started to talk, got some more upset. She just needs to get away from here. Soon and very soon though, I told her. I wish I could remember more what was said between us but I don't. She came up like she was going to hug me. I was cool with that. Nice to be someone else's support, you know. Except, she didn't hug me. Like, one arm was in the right place but the other one was beside my face and the next thing you know *HOT DAMN* I was smack in the middle of my first kiss. That's right. My. First. Kiss. I know it wasn't snogging but I can definitely see what all the talk is about.

She didn't stay long after that. Smiled, at me, gave me another quick kiss and then kind of hurried off. I was able to remain fairly composed until she left and then I lost it. I hope she was out of earshot when I let out that whoop but if not, hey, at least she knows she made my night and my school year. After that I just sat and thought for what I thought was a short while, but apparently it wasn't.

Jobe,
Your baby brother finally caught up with you. Took me three more years but finally, quiet Tobe has been kissed...and by a very sweet and very hot young lady."

"event","All right, I know full good and well that I shouldn't be horribly excited, but I am. Something /very/ good happened. 

I've found out that I'm fairly normal. Mr. Brown doesn't want to run screaming. I can still be his intern and...well, even if he may have been humoring me with a few things - like telling me stuff I already knew, just because I needed to hear a professional say it - maybe, just maybe, he thinks I'm competent for this internship. HA! I'm normal. Well, if the entire world fools each other into thinking that, maybe I can too.

Then, to add heart-stopping (if slightly confusing) to the very good....

I've got a date. I. Have. A. DATE. With. PAIGE! Now, some things were a little backward. She asked me. Now, I know, ideally, that I should ask the girl but in this case...who the hell, cares? I promised not to read to much into it. She doesn't want a boyfriend. But, see, that's fine. Because who on earth really thinks I'm ready to be one? Not me. I could do backflips at the moment, but I won't. 

You can't help but feel a little guilty about it. You know? I'm not mentioning it to anyone. I'd hate for something to somehow get back to Luke. Or to have the gossipmill start turning on my account.

And...GAH, why did she have to put pictures in my head like that with the whole disappearing bathing suit comment. On one hand, I think she'd be horrified...on the other, I strangely think she'd be a little proud.

OK. Getting to weird now, even for my twisted brain."

My world is falling apart. Maybe this fun little experiment wasn't supposed to happen.  Maybe I really should have just stayed in that chair. Life would be easier. So much easier.

Still, I can't say I haven't enjoyed having my life back. Though, maybe it would be best for me to sacrifice myself to make life flow right for everyone else. Amend damage done.

Maybe."

"event","All right...Not written in a bit. Been trying to figure out exactly what it is I needed to write...what it was I was feeling...

Not that it helped.

So a few days ago, I went out to the lake. I was going to tan...a pair of jeans were sacrificed in order to give me shorts so I don't have to cause inadvertant blindness from people seeing my near nakedness, but I digress. I get to the lake and notice that Daniel and Paige are having a splash fight. So what do I do? Of course, I join. Heh...I said of course, like I've been doing it for years...maybe it's a good sign.

So I'm in the lake and Daniel is asking me to splash Paige and Paige was asking me to splash Daniel. Tempted though I was to turn the odds in Paige's favor I just didn't know...so I turned on both of them. Which ended in some screaming, lots of wetness and me, very randomly, doing a flying tackle on Paige to keep her in the lake. Then she demanded we carry her in like the Princess she is.

Then Luke showed up. I wish I knew why I felt like a kid in a candy jar then. Paige is my friend. Friends have waterfights...why the guilt? Luke's a good guy. Quiet. Hard to read. But good. Though, if you ask me more than a little obsessive over this whole cooking thing. Prince Pastry?! it's right up there with Prince Cream Puff. I know I'm not the definition of manliness but come on! Well, he waded out and carried her to shore then disappeared, followed shortly after by Paige. 

Daniel and I talked. Just about the future, a little about tattoos and stuff. It was a good talk. Glad for that."

"event","Well, this has been a rather eventful day. 

Well, after the talk about tanning with Paige I decided that maybe I should get some more sun, especially if that pool party she mentioned should happen. I was truthful, though, about not having any shorts. I finally figured if I was going to have tan legs that I would have to do the unthinkable...tan in just my boxers. I remembered a forgotten little corner of the garden that Joby and I found our first year when we wanted to get away and talk. The bushes have grown over the path and so it looks like a dead end unless you really investigate. So I snuck out there once, stripped down and laid out. I got a little pink but it had faded by night. No one knew. I figured I had this thing worked out and so I tried again...

Never fall asleep sunbathing in your underwear. Someone is bound to find you.

Paige apparently heard my snoring and dug through the bushes. Saw me and fell...which woke me up. I thought I was going to DIE right there and I've never scrambled for pants so fast in my entire life. Which made for much one-leg hopping and then my falling on my rear right there. Not all of my pink was sun. I lost the ability to speak correctly and sort of blathered my story in Paige's direction. I did start to calm down and then realizes that I still didn't have a shirt on, which caused another mild panic. Though, it was pointed out to me if I am going to this pool party then I need to get used to being seen without my shirt. So I didn't put it back on, just left my plucked chicken self right out there. We talked for a bit more. About swimsuits, ogling, how I need to catch up on three years of life...and ogling...and embarassment...and girls. Oh, and about our tattoos. Paige wants to get one now, too. On her chest, so I told her for Luke's sake I'd just hold her hand and look in the opposite direction. Which is good, I'd need incentive not to stare...maybe I'm more of a natural at this ogling than she thinks...Gosh, that sounds bad...

Well, it's looking like I have a new lease on life...and the makings of a tan."

Oh great day in the morning! 

The past few days have been great. Weird, but great. To start with, I got talked into going to the Quidditch pitch for the carnival. I didn't stay long but for the length I was there, I had a blast. I looked around for a bit, but hung close to Paige. She is one of my best friends after all. I got first try to sink her in the dunking booth and once I was able to ignore the fact that she was sitting there in a bikini I sunk her. And boy, was she ever in a bikini. Then, she was wet in a bikini. There's good reason why I snuck off. On top of that, I 'borrowed' a broom to go practice some flying. Those brooms are more steady than mine.

Then, this morning, I was up on the battlements like I usually am. Was messing with Remus and all. Not completely dressed for classes. Paige came up there. Was checking on her owl. You know, I don't quite remember how it happened but in just a little while, I was given my first backrub (gosh, that looks so stupid written down at my age...wonder if it sounded just as dumb), was told that I was hot, and then gave a massage. I don't know which I enjoyed more. Though that's a hard combination to beat. Makes me wonder a few things. Like, why do I get stupid around her? Why does she have to be so pretty? and If she wasn't taken, could she possibly see me as more than Ol' Toby?"

It's so gorgeous up there. You can see forever. Which strangely is another reason I should never play Quidditch: I'd get distracted by the view and get smashed by both bludgers at once.

It was amazing. And then I told Paige that she had to make me fear for my life. And man, did she ever do that. Plummetting from, oh, I'd say about forty feet up and pulling up only at the last minute...my heart stopped. And I LOVED it. Somewhere after the panic and stopped, there was a little voice inside me that was screaming 'That was SOOOO Cool. Can we do it again? Huh? Can we? Please?' Maybe it was my inner kid. The one who never got to play alot after the break. Maybe it was a rare chance when the veil parted and I got to share a moment with Job. I don't know, but I do know that it was amazing. I want, no, need to do more things like that. I need to tell that to Paige. I think she'd get a kick.

Speaking of her. Never realized it before, but she's very pretty. Not that anyone is going to ever hear that. Not that I thought she was ugly before...she was always just Paige. Our buddy Paige."

"event","Talked for a while with Paige last night. Would have written about it but we talked until we were both exhausted. We decided falling asleep together in front of a fire probably was /not/ wise. Not for burns but for the rumor mill that would have started up in the morning.

For all my thinking I was pretty much over it, this past day slapped me up one side and down the other about it all. Bless Paige. She's going to need alot of patience to try to do an internship she's not had hardly any classes in and put up with me. I promised I would help her. The good thing with mindhealing is that it doesn't require a whole lot of actual Healing Arts stuff, bedside manner perhaps but no splint in the world will help fix a broken mind. And Merlin knows she's listened to me enough over the past three years.

And it seems she's volunteered for it again. I think she thinks I'm not getting enough of what I feel out. I journal daily (well, most of the time), sometimes I write pages and pages. I honestly haven't been dwelling on it as much. But I needed to talk last night.

So many doubts. What if I'm too screwed up to be a mindhealer. Perry Brown could look at me and say, ""Sorry. You need to make appointments with me daily for the rest of your life and go...be a Potion salesman or something."" I want to be a mindhealer though, all of my problems or not.

Sleep. I need sleep. Though, Paige said she'd go with me to get my tattoo I want done. That's exciting. She's a great friend."

"event","Well, good thing I bought this new journal during the Hogsmeade weekend. It really does help clear one's brain. And, even though it is very early? Maybe it's very late? Not real sure...anyway, with a little help from Lumos I can write for a bit.

Davey, Donelle's brother, woke up with another of his nightmares. Screamed and I woke right up. I guess old habbits die hard? Job and I used to wake up whenever the other had a nightmare. I asked if he was all right. Davey, not Joby. We talked about nightmares. Sounds like he had a pretty awful one. Being pulled under by drowned people. Not drowning. Drowned. Already dead. Bloated, he said. I told him I used to have ones about the fire. That I still do on occasion. Not dwelling on those now, though.

He didn't know. Oddly, that has some comfort to it. I can be Toby, not Toby-who-used-to-have-a-twin. Though it hurts some too. I don't want Job forgotten. Let Davey see my scar. He touched it...I guess to see if I was telling the truth? He finally did get sleepy again.

The kid gave me a hug. I know he wasn't completely comfortable with it, but it was nice. I think I needed that as much as he did. I gave him a noogie as well. He really seems like a decent kid.

Here's to peaceful sleep for the both of us. 

Bro, Wish you were here... T"

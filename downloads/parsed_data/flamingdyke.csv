Anywho, the real purpose of this post was to let those of you who read this more than myspace that my phone screen has died. I can not recieve texts, nor do I have access to anyones phone number! SO please e-mail your number, or call me and say hi!

Remember kids: Cell phones and wet grass don't mix!!"

So I recently made a friend who is VERY interesting, andvery LJ centered (vs myspace) so I may pop on here a wee bit more often.

In a nut shell, Life is good. Work is crazy, Love is... well... I don't know. But I am happy! And truthfully, that is the important part!

Sometime, when I can breath (currently I am god-awful sick!) I will write a lengthy update. Or maybe I won't. LOL Maybe I'll start just WRITING... maybe something intelligent... hahhaa!

Not this time!!

Hope my long lost LJ friends are well!!"

I found that amusing.

On a different note:
  I have had the opportunity to collaborate with a friend on a mixed media performing arts piece. She is a dancer, and I created the sound for her interpretive dance! the narration that goes a long with it is very interesting too (she also created that). It is coming together great!!  Anyone who is bored and feels like a field trip to Wells College, should come see our creation! It is great to be DOING something worthwhile and creative again!! I have been lax since I left school...  Call for more details!! If you don't have my number, leave a message here for details!!"

"event","Oy!! I am still alive!!!  After what was supposed to be 7 days of work in a row... turned into EIGHT days in a row,  emerge from the raw sewage of dennys... However, it ended well!

Tues and wed were my last PIC shifts. I was a lot more bitter than I expected... oh well. Hopefully they will actually train me on the shit they said they would...

thursday i got to leave early. That was cool. I have no idea what I did with the day... Oh wait!! Yeah I do!! We went to Spaghetti Warehouse!!! OMG I love that place!!  More and more thanks to Liz and Jason for giving us the directions!!! Mmm..REAL sourdough bread...

Friday was exciting. We had massive wind storms in the area. Denny's lost power. there were down trees all over the place. We were sitting around in the dark, cause we can't leave in case the power comes back on. well, we get a call from the area manager pleading with me and my trainee (I was his ride anyhow) to go to the ONLY store in the area that had power. Jeesus christ people, if the power goes out, you DO have the option of going someplace OTHER than denny's.. ugh. We didn't want to go due to the horror stories we'd heard about that store...but it was either go, or go home. And I wanted the pay. So! Do NOT ever eat the the Denny's on 7th north street *gag*. Though I will say I like how their cooks like was set up. I have only worked in perkins conversion stores. But ew.

saturday I woke up at 7am. Had a rough night friday night. Should have called in slept through my damn alarm. I was supposed to be at work at 6am. fuck. Insult to injury, there was a whiteout outside. bad day. No one crossed my path when I finally got to work. I was SO fucking cranky. work finally ended. Went to my second job, was a lot less grumpy, then had a good long sleep. 

Sunday I was supposed to be trained to do orientations, however, I ended having to stay and cook until almost 6pm. However, I remained in a pleasent mood. sunday night we had a lovely evening with two good friends.. went to ithaca had some AMAZING mediterranean food.. omg.. we will totally have to go back there!! Though I did miss the Mate... lol It was a very nice relaxing night.

Monday I slept a lot. Went to work at 2. I was greeted by the evening manager asking who the dinner cook was, and when I told him I was he rolled his eyes. Nice. he's such a dick. Fortunately, I am not the only one who thinks this... lol. The night went well though. it was busy. The place closed at 10pm cause we were having our grease hoods cleaned. I clocked out at about 39 hours or so... Oh!!!  And I saved a mouse!!! there was a cute (and FAT) mouse in the back of the restaurant and I caught it, and set it free many miles away!!

So tuesday I was supposed to have the day off... at about 9:30am, I get a call from the area manager (while I am still asleep)

""Morning Vicki, we have a crisis at store 2185. We don't care about over time. Can you work?""

Still mostly asleep ""which store is 2185?""

""Your store.""

""oh yeah, I knew that. What's the crisis?""

""vince (the denny's inspector.. feared more than the NY health inspector and probably even god) is here.""

""oh christ. Who's cooking?""

""freddie.""

""yeah, I'm 30mins away, but I will get there as soon as I can!""

So! Freddie is a great guy, I like him alot. However, he is a slob, and doesnt do.. well, ANYTHING to denny's brand standards, and is probably the absolute WORST cook we could have on during an inspection. So I showered and headed to dennys. I acutally had fun, and I got three hours of over time. I did the best I could but was having a hard time telling how the inspection was going. Vince likes his job waaaay too much. I respect that. i would love that job. lol. So the day went on. At 2 the evening cook came in, I finished my clean up and went home. Stopped at wegmans and got inspired!!  I got stuff for Chili, plus grapes and carrots to munch on!

Amanda got home and we broke out the crock pot for the first time. OMG, the chili is SO friggin good. I will post the recipe in a separate entry.. lol this one is already a book!!

So later in the evening I get a phone call from one of my managers. She tells me we GOT the FOUR DIAMOND status that we wanted!! That is awsome!!  We have been striving for this hard core since the last inspection!! She thanked me for coming in and told me I made the different. That was pretty darn cool!

Then at 9:30 I got a call from my General Manager! He thanked me repeatedly for coming in, told me over and over than we would not have gotten it if I hadn't been there. AND that Vince noticed me too. In a good way. That is awsome! I really tried my best when I was there (lol, though i did break TWO plates.. lol) It was really gratifying to know that my efforts were not wasted AND were noticed. That really makes one feel good about their job, even if it IS just denny's. So that made my night!

SO! TOday, it has been my goal to not do a DAMN thing. And I have been successful. well.. I did finish my book.. and ate chili.. lol... 

Yay!"

"event","So! It has been a while since I posted an actual update, vs just saying I am bored, or Yay! it's snowing...

So! This past weekend my Mom came up to visit us. We had a lovely time! Unfortunately I was at work for most of it, but fortunately her and amanda get along swimmingly! Mom showed her piece she is working on or the restaurant to the owners and they LOVED it, which is awsome! I am so excited!

Sunday Mom left and after work Amanda and I went to a super bowl party. That was lots of fun!!  Thanks again for inviting us Kae!! Met some really cool people, some of whom I hope to hang with more. I NEED friends...

Monday I found out that our store has been approved for 4 managers. This is good and bad. It's bad because this new guy is going to take all my PIC hours. that blows. however, it is good because our store DESPERATELY needs 4 managers AND this frees me up to be trained on other shit. I will be learning inventory, ordering and other morning responsibilities.

Tuesday, the area manager was in and my boss and her were discussing my future. It came up that they really need trainers and store openers right now. Something that I am WAY more interested in than management! So the Area Manager asked when I would be free to go, and my boss said a month or two, which really isn't that long!!! They just need to get the cooks situation settled. I ampsyched about this potnetial opportunity. I really would like to be a store opener. The send you to brand new denny's, and you help them get on their feet. You train and help out the whole staff! They pay for travel food and lodging!! It's an exciting prospect, even if I am away from home for a long time! the networking potential and just the experience in general is very exciting!

Then I have had three days off. And I will not bitch about last night. I already did."

"event","Those four words sum up my day...

Nay:

 Denny's. So, there is a carbon monoxide rumor going around.. started by a MANAGER. So, what exactly, are we supposed to believe? We hear this, then put together some symptoms that do NOT usually occur, but have been lately, and they relate to CO poisoning. What do you do? Should you call the fire dept? talk to your GM? nothing? These questions ran through my head all day, while at the same token I am wondering if I am killing myself slowly for being there in the first place.

YEAH!!!

TATTOO!!  Werd! It still needs the texture and detail, but YAY!! I will post pics tomorrow. I really like my shop. I feel very comfortable there, and like the people.

Whoa...

So, while getting my tattoo I was offered a job by the co-owner who also works at Chili's. whoa. STARTING pay waaaay more than I make now, with acutal opportunities to move up. For example, their raises are not cents, they are DOLLARS. the guy is the kitchen supervisor. 36-40 hours a week. full benefits at like 100 a month. FULL benefits... and a NEW kitchen.. with WORKING  equipment.. a CLOSED kitchen, so we can cuss all we want. whoa.. sensory over load man. Too much to digest at once.. wow. A whole lot to think about. I am going in on weds to talk to the GM there....

Hmm:

So, after all that I went to Dennys to talk to our GM who was working tonight about the CO rumors. I believe in going straight to the source. I came armed with a CO detector and everything (we needed one for the house anyhow). He said they were just rumors. He said Sure! Bring your detector back! I say Ok! and  go and get it. On my way back in he stops me at the door. Says he changed his mind. We shouldn't do that, cause were not experts. blah blah blah. No shit. That is why the MAKE detectors, cause WE""RE NOT EXPERTS. Meanwhile, he can't make eye contact. Hmmm... makes you wonder. Makes weds sound more interesting...

they say everything happens for a reason. If I had gotten my tattoo as scheduled on thursday, I may never have run into this guy. Nor would I have the desire to leave denny's like I have now.Hmm...

Nay. YEAH! whoa.. Hmm..."

So, we finally got out and I got amanda to class, surprisingly, she was only 10mins late. I was gonna do my usual wondering, but yesterday was fucken COLD! The wind was wicked, and YES< unlike many of the dumbasses out on the SU campus, I was dressed for the weather! Fleece lined jeans, head sock and all!!

After she was done with her classes we abducted one of her friends and got Sushi. MMmmmm... If you are in Syracuse, and looking for good suchi, go to Secret Garden on Erie Blvd. It is not far from Fucillo's evil empire... err.. Hyudai dealer. The servers are assholes, but the food is GREAT!!

"event","<P>Yay!!&nbsp; This little guy was on a rock near the parking lot. I love Wooley Bear Catapillers.. they are cute, and fun to pet!<BR><IMG alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"" src=""http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a44/Flamingdyke/wooley.jpg""><BR></P>

<P>These next to are reversed. I took this one just before leaving, and the next one when we first arrived. The temp is so warm you can actually see there is less snow and ice on the rocks in this pic than in the next. It was neat! You could practically watch it shrink! We also saw a fair number of decent sized ice fall. That always amuses me!<BR><IMG alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"" src=""http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a44/Flamingdyke/falls2.jpg""><BR><BR><IMG alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"" src=""http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a44/Flamingdyke/Falls.jpg""><BR>Fun trip!&nbsp; Only a short drive from us too!&nbsp; We would love to show it to friends who visit, so come visit!!&nbsp; It was great to get outside again. We are both so busy things kinda get hectic, and we don't have a whole lot of time during the daylight to go out and enjoy nature.</P>

<P>On another happy note:&nbsp; There is a tofurkey roasting in our oven.. I have never tried it before! I am excited!! It smells GREAT!!</P>"

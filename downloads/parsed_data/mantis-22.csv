"event","Well, Saturday our paintball team headed south to Bear Claw, TN. Our game was Sunday and we got there uber early. Muah here drove the 3 hour expedition there. We stayed at a Days Inn that night and mainly chilled. I drank my first shot of vodka in months for social sake, and to be a designated driver heh. Me and Seth watched Spike TV for most of the night, mainly guys blowing up cars all night. But after the shot I headed to bed, to rely on the next morning.

Sunday morning sucked, I had a odd sickness in my stomach. To better myself I only chugged on water for the rest of the day at the paintball field down the road. I went through 9 Dasani bottles to make it sound like a record. We were doing great the whole day till our captains gun messed up in game and we took a loss that shoulden't of happened. Our captain is fixing the problem this week by selling the gun and buying a much better and more reliable one. We went home hard hearted at first but we know for sure we will make up for it in the next few games for sure.

On the way home, we thought instead of taking interstates, that it would be faster to take scenic routes and highways. We were damned wrong to start that nice outcome out. It took us 6 hours to get home, from what only took us 3 hours on the interstates to get there. I got pulled over in bumfuck nowhere by a Rosco sheriff for speeding also. It was a weekend of events as you can see.

I thought alot about Liz this weekend. I really missed her, holding her.... anything, I just feel so lost anymore not talking to her. I guess its for the better, I just dont want to rush or hurt her. Oh well, till next time.

I can't wait to go to the baseball game with her tomorrow after school. It means alot that she invited me to go too. I'm all smiles right now.

"event","Ok, so it has been indeed, a long, destroying, humilifying, in-stupidiotic week. To cut to the chase and I'll break it down for you about whats been going on this week due to me not posting on here for the past few days. 

 On Saturday of last week we had paintball practice. It was a pain in the arse. I had both of my paintball markers go down in practice, and to top off the day I messed up like 4 times in the drills. I need to start focusing more in practice on the weekends. After practice, I took a nice long, warm shower. I was pooped and didn't want to even bother go nowhere for the rest of the night. Nuff' said.

 Sunday, oh yes! You were the motherfscker of them all almost. I lost 50 bucks which I supposively left on my car dash, now gone. And to top the cake, I have two broken paintball guns. And we have a tournament coming up on the 10th so wooptie-fscking doo.

 Monday, fsck you Monday.

 Tuesday I rendered myself to go to the college. I found out the girl I was dating previously went back out with her ex boyfriend for a day and then broke up with him just as fast. She said she wanted to see if she still had feelings for him. I personally don't care. We weren't even technically going out. My mistake, once again.

<center><img src=""http://www.oneposter.co.uk/UserData/Poster/Poster_12572.jpg""></center>

 Wednesday, I decided to Ebay both of my paintball guns. I say fuck it, sell em 100$ bucks cheaper than what I paid for them and let some other focker deal with em. I'm done with autocockers for a long time. While Ebaying this shizzle I also dumped some other stuff on ebay to get out of my hands. I got alot of bills coming up.

 Thursday, I found a hella of a deal online for a paintball gun I always wanted so I bought it with credit, I should have the funds to pay it at the end of this month (April), anyways so why not. I also ordered a few extra parts to go with the gun. I can't wait to get this bad boy. Its nasty as hell and its gonna be my baby soon.

 Friday, well... Today is Friday and its the same old shit. I'm tired, I gotta go get my damn prom tux tomorrow in Bronston, and I have no gun to use this weekend at practice. I guess i'm at a loss. Money seems to be killing me lately. Hopefully this shit blows over soon."

"event","Eh, I tried to sleep again tonight with no luck. And this morning I gotta be up @ 9AM for practice with the team. All night I've watched movies, eat pizza, and drink up on caffeine. I've thought about Liz and missed her alot since last Tuesday. I'd do anything to have that night again. I miss her voice and its only been a few hours. The pictures just aren't enough to keep me sane. Anyways, I'm gonna head back to bed. I gotta wake up early. Till tomorrow...

It mainly compiled of people I never talk to or associate with. It was weird as fsck. I haven't gotten any messages from Liz today. She stopped texting me last night @ around 1:40 AM or so I guess she hit the sack or something. Weird cause she always texts me once in the morning but she hasen't. I hope shes okay or whichever. Anyways, I'm out. I gotta go deposit some cash in the bank and pickup some money from a friend.

And today, well. Now I gotta answer them before I go back into insomniac mode. Mainly anything from relationship, to love, to even jacking the neighbors Bass Tracker and driving it off of Keno. Long story made short, I have alot of questions to be answered on my own. Nuff said.

 I tried going to sleep but I guess I coulden't dump myself into a pillow before these bad boys get answered. More than likely I'm gonna be like this, sleepless till I know :/. I gotta wake up for college in 5 hours. Lets hope I wake up in time... Or even that, that I can get some sleep.

 It all started when I seen some abercrombie shorts and a element hoodie dirt-cheap for sale on ebay. Once I noticed I had enough cash in the bank I blew, blew, blew. Don't get me wrong, cheap clothes new that are worth more own, but yeah. I have about $233 left in the bank for the rest of the month. Not a problem, but I better be saving to pay next month's car insurance lol. Not to mention getting new suspension installed on the coupe @_@. Oh well, money sucks.

Today I went on a date with Liz @ the movies. We wen't to see the ""Ring 2"". I've seen the first one, it was pretty good minus the killer dead horses, and the freak frying his body to death in the bathtub with the toaster... On another sweet note.

It wen't really well. When I first seen her she looked so drop dead gorgeous. There wasen't a thing about her I coulden't of noticed. I loved being with her every minute through the movie. I love this girl! 

After the movie we kissed. I think that set me off to top off one of the best, maybe the best night of my life. I was so happy the entire date that I coulden't take off a smile. I loved it so much.

 Till next time..."

"event","Yeah, so I finally beat it on legendary. Game of the year, depicted long awaited console genre... Halo 2.
The ending regardless of what people said to me kicked ass. I know its not the end of the series yet but it filled in alot of questions most players got lost on in the first Halo. Which concludes me on that part that the final game on Xbox 2 is going to be an amazing finish. 

Anyways, that topped most of my day off. I was thinking of going back down in the basement and prepping the PC case for when the last parts finally arrive. But I guess i'm too lazy to get up :P.Its been a long day, and i'm sure tomorrow won't be any better heh.

Oh well, its not like I look up at faith to give me anything anymore :)"

I had a fun time on Xbox live in chat with some black guys from Michigan and they were making plays with the voice masking. One would have a big guy voice and the other one had a child voice over and he would keep asking the kid if he wanted a ""candy bar"" LOL. Long story, anyways yeah.

I got off at 8:00 tired as fock, yet the rain seems to cool my anger heh. Its about 10:35 now and I am bored outta my mind. I called Xoxid.com about the PC case they shipped damaged and they seem to be nice about fixing it and sending me a new one. With that off my shoulders I now only have to find another job...

"event","Chad sent this to my dad last night 

""Hey I got your email from Brooke. This is Chad. I was just wanting to say how happy I am that I am marrying your daughter.  And That I'm really excited to be apart of your family.   My Family is kind of Distant and we never talk so its nice to see a family that wants to be around each other.   I just want to let you know that I love your daughter with all my heart and she  can be a handful sometimes, but I think that if me and  Brooke can work out all of our problems now then maybe we can make it as long as you and your wife have made it.  I have so much respect for Brooke because she knows what she wants and goes for it.  My family was never that encouraging and it really motivates me to see her doing all these things and making something of herself and I hope that I can be Half the person that Brooke is.  In short, I just want to say that you've raised a strong daughter and I think she's rubbing off on me because from now on I really want to accomplish any goal I set and I want to make something of myself to.   I love your Daughter with all my heart. You guys are like the family I never had.

With the upmost resect,
Chad Callis""

That is really fucking sweet. he was kinda fucked up when he sent it, but it's the thought that counts! hahaha"

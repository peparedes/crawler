I guess i realize now that its me people dont like ... it took me to loose that one special someone to get me thinkin bout it all .... People just hate me and its my fault ... i dont kno what i do ... But i wish it'd stop...

"event","Well.... A LOT has happened since july 31st since i last updated. Well I shaved off my mohak that i've had for like 2 years and now my hairs startin to grow bak. I've been hell bound on getting a job and finaly getting the hell out of this house.  Me and KAra Broke up and a lot of shyt happened and we arnt getting bak 2gether again ... I've been with her for 2 years off and on and she's the 1st girl i've ever loved ... its not that easy to let go ya kno? .... I attempted to end all my pain and suffering a few nights ago ... My life got too fukt up too fast and i coodnt handle it. My friend Sam moved bak from Florida. Nuthin really 2 say there except i kno we cant be as close as we were ... My fault. Im a fuk up i kno. My mom is a fuckin crackhead now. 2day .. well yesterday since its 4:30 in the A.M .. But yea yesterday she left at like 3 o clock wanted my gma 2 watch hunter (my lil bro) for an hour my muthafuckin crackhead ass mom didnt show up until 2:00 in the morning. I cant fuckin beleive her ... Im about sick n tired of her bullshyt ... imma bout 2 let her kno how it is. I mean i cant force her to do shyt but she's gonna loose my little brothers and i cant let that shyt happen. If it comes 2 it i have 2 choose them over her. And maybe when she straightens up she can prolly be involved in these 2 kid's life ... she never was with mine ... So i gotta try n make their lives better then my childhood was. Im still lonely and depressed about all of my bullshyt. Everything seems to always pile up on me at once. Im goin in to my uncles friends work 2 get a job ... Its hard work but it's 9$ an hour ... And i need a job that will hire a fuk up like me. Im gonna try within the next 2 - 3 days to go get my permit or license one of the two ... then i gotta make 100$ to get my aunts car fixed so i can get it ... And that problem will be solved. But its way 2 late and im tired ... So i'll update mopre often i promise ... WEll for anyone who actually reads this... I dont think neone does ... But alright im passin out ... Later Fuks

My moms still a crackhead and she keeps fuckin aroun like she is shes gonan get my lil brothers taken away from her and if she does im totally droppin my mom b/c that'll be the very last straw after all of this shyt. Im starting to really change ... im motavated to getr a job and get my license and move out for sum reason ... but i like it b/c i reall hate it here but what can i do lol ... Alright anyway what else ... Im guessin nuthin Well nuthin that i can think of now ... ya kno since all my thoughts r kinda focus upon sumone else lol ... But imma get goin and TRY 2 sleep again ... OH WAIT ... Read this ... I just wrote it like 5 minutes ago .. and i have no clue why ... But yea lol I guess she just does it to me lol .. LAter

Tossing and Turning unable to find a comfortable place
It's been hours but there's still a smile on my face
U've been on my mind since minute one 
It's been a long time since that's been done
But the feeling i get when u come 2 mind 
It's kinda Like A rush and A High all combined
I kno this sounds silly and kinda strange 
But im sorry I dont want this feeling to change"

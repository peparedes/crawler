I just went and bought a whole stack of Third day tikkies this morning...woo hoo! Can't WAIT to go see them, its going to be incredible =)

And now I'm procrastinating, cos I have an assessment due tomorrow, gah! 

There is a whole heap of stuff I'm looking forward this and next year - Quidam, Kedron Primary Camp, The Cat Empire, Dirty Dancing, finishing Uni, turning 21, Gunnedah Summer Mission, SONFEST!! (hopefully including a week up in QLD!), and the Third day concert! woo hoo! =) God is also continually showing me and teaching me a lot, and I'm looking forward to growing closer to Him everyday and being able to live EVERYDAY for Him, and seeing the things He has planned for my life =)"

Prac finished on Thurs..I was actually really sad to leave the ward - because of both the staff and the patients..I learnt SO much on this placement..thanks to the nurse that I was working with the whole time, I was able to do many things for the first time ever - catheters, staples, stitches, wound drains...I am so thankful for the guidance and support she offered me throughout my whole placement! And I met some lovely, lovely patients. I just can't wait till next year when I will FINALLY be qualified and out there doing what I've been going through Uni for..yay =)

Was challenged alot in this last week, and for some time was feeling as if I had a heavy burden on my shoulders..but its so amazing how when you hand things over to God and put your trust in Him how that burden seems to disappear in an instant..He is amazing =)

Went to salsa for the first time in about a year on thurs night..Jess, my cousin Hayden's girlfriend, had asked us to come along as a surprise for Hayden as it was his birthday earlier on in the week...so Lexi, myself, Cheese and Luke all came along for a bit of dancing =). Reminded me of how much fun I had last year learning salsa!! 

Yesterday I went to DFO with Lexi and Ads and did a bit of retail therapy! Got some tops and a new pair of pants, all for bargain prices =). Then yesterday night, myself, Lexi, Ads and James all headed into the city for a bit of RETRO dancing! woo! It was so much fun hanging with those dudes..I love those guys and appreciate their friendship so much..=) 

Today we headed around to my grandparents place for a bit of a family gathering for lunch =).  Got to catch up with the fam again, which was awesome! My Uncle Ray and Aunty Beryl were also down visiting from Queensland, so it was good to see them again..their grand-daughter, my second cousin who is 19, recently got engaged, and we were able to see the vid of that..it was soooo beautiful!! It was all caught on camera cos her and her fiance both sing in performances, and at the end of one performance, in front of hundreds of people, he started singing ""Come away with me"" - 'their' song -to her, then got down on one knee and proposed!! It was sooo lovely!! aww!!! 

Unfortunately Grandad still isn't looking too good at the moment at all...I am so worried about him..his heart is just not working properly, and there isn't much that the medical staff can do about it now, because it has already had so many problems in the past..he can barely walk a few steps without turning absolutely blue in the face and lips and looking as if he is about to pass out..it isn't good  =( One thing that gives me hope though is knowing that he is a child of God, and nothing can change that...praise the Lord.."

Seen so many different cases - with many people in following motor vehicle accidents, with such traumatic injuries...many of the patients have to have screws drilled through their skin and into their bones to hold everything together..so after seeing all this high-tech stuff, I accidently had a bit of a chuckle when I read that one lady was recently admitted after having, I quote, ""choked on a sausage""...gah!"

Spent all day doing uni assignments (that wasn't the awesome bit! haha) and got two of them outta the way...now only 2 more assignments to go, and one presentation, and I'm freeee for about 7 weeks or so...woo! =)Can't wait for the hols! =)
Sunday was such a great day..Our family headed out to Riverstone to see our cousin Hayden get baptised...was such an encouraging service and witness..=) They also had this family from Texas along that gave their testimony..and WOW, what amazingly powerful stories they had to share with us...both the husband and the wife had, many years before, been involved with all kinds of things - drugs, sex, crime - yet the Lord was able to come into their lives and cause a total turnaround..
A lunch was held at the church, then our fam and relos and some of Hayden's friends headed back to his place for afternoon tea...golly gosh, I ate SO much food..hahaha..it was all just TOO delicious!! =)It was so fantastic spending the morn and arvo with my fam..I love them all so much!! Hayden's friend Andy came along as well, and it was really cool seeing him again! Cheese and I always have a little giggle when we see him, cos before he met us, he saw us on a video at Hayden's place, not knowing that we were his cousins. Anyway, Hayden pointed it out to him that we were his cuzzies, and Andy was a bit like ""..huh?"" and, in the most polite way, said to Hayden - ""...aren't they a little bit.....oriental?"" Haha, sooo funny..I think he's a little embarrassed about it now, but we seriously dont care! We think its an absolute cack, hehe =). Ahh, many memories of growing up and people not believing that we were cousins =) Actually, what am I talking about - ""memories of growing up""?!? Sometimes people STILL don't believe us! They are always like ""yeah..right..*wink wink*..'cousins' ""..hehe =)(for those who don't know, Hayden is 100% aussie, hehe). 
It was a blast from the past seeing Hayden's friend Nathan at church as well...I had met him once, years and years ago, when he came around to my grandparents place with Hayden one day..I seriously hadn't see him in about 10 years!! hahaha..spun me out =P
Then, I got to head back home to come and hear lil Donny boy speak at Narraweena Baptist....Lexi and Ads met at my place before, then we headed down. What an incredible encouragement it was to hear lil Donny speak..it is so awesome to see God using his children in amazing ways to help spread the wonderful message of the Gospel..=) It was also fantastic to see all my beautiful friends again..having lots going through my head the past week, it was good to have it all put back into perspective today..God is AMAZING, we should never lose sight of the reason He has kept us here on earth, and never take for granted the wonderful things He has blessed us with, such as incredibly precious friends. I love all of you guys =).

Best quote from the weekend: ""I could have flicked him like a booga!"" (say with a southern american accent! hehe)
Funniest quote from the past: ""Aren't they are little bit...oriental???""

Love u guys =)

Unfortunately, that stinky lil hot water bottle decided to bust over my leg, and now am left with a chunky delicious red welt...gah, was so hot!! Am scared of using hot water bottles now :S. 
Thurs night was good :) Went to see Van Helsing with Lexi, Cheeseburger, Lil Donny, Adzy and Mark :) I really liked the movie!! I had heard some good and some bad reports about it..but I quite enjoyed it..:) ""I wonder where they got the idea for this movie from?"" ""Mmm...from their brains..:)"" (Don't worry if you don't understand what I'm talking about :) ) Go Hugh! Go Kate! Wooo! :):)
Yesterday I worked all day at the cheesy cheesecake shop..but early into the day I encountered a little problem..when bending down to put a bowl in the mixer, my pants decided they would rip on me, right on my be-hind. Mmm, great huh?!? I freaked out as to what I would do if a customer walked in, and had to tie my apron on backwards until I was able to drive home and quickly change! Gah! 
Yesterday night was youth group, which went well :) We had a Playstation/Nintendo 64 playoff, which the kids enjoyed! Cynthia Marlin gave a really good talk, and Ads shared a lil of his testimony..very encouraging to us all :) 
Now today I'm heading out to the 'bra' with Adzy, Lil Donny, and Cheese for a Gunnedah Summer Mission meeting...first one for the year! Will be good to catch up with everyone again..I'm so excited about Mission! :) Then straight after, we are heading to a Camp Kedron reunion/meeting for the Primary camp in Sep this year..promises to be a good day :) 
Ciao party people! Sorry for my rambles..you all have a good day today :):)"

"event","Just about to leave for prac, but thought I would quickly write an entry..I got home from prac last night at 1030pm...now its 6am and I'm just about to head there again..starting prac this week was a shock, because I came back to the hospital to find out that one of the patient's who Ive been looking after over the past few weeks died last week...she was only 37..I was so shocked. The poor thing, she was SO unwell, and in so much pain. A few days before she died, I noticed a bible in her drawer, and I was going to ask her about it, but she was totally wiped out, so I decided to ask her later..unfortunately I didn't get the chance because she wasn't there when I returned :( But I truely hope that she is in a much better place now.."

"event","Ahh, I had such a nice & relaxing weekend..how beautiful was the weather?!?! I love the sun..so nice and warm..hehe =). Saturday I headed to Chatswood in the morning and did a bit of shopping..then came back home cos Ads came over to help me clean my car! =). It was so grubby, but thanks to Ads its nice and shiny now, haha =). We were planning on going for a bushwalk in the arvo, but we ran out of time, so instead headed up to West Head Lookout - it is so beautiful there! So peaceful, and you can see all the different headlands, and right across to Palm Beach! =). Later in the evening, Cheese and I and the girlies from church headed around to Lyndal's place for a girls night..pigged out on delicious food and watched Pirates of the Caribbean - I love that movie!! I never used to really like Johnny Depp, but he is just such a cack in the movie, haha =). Yesterday I went to church in the morning, and got to catch up with Andrew Eadie in the afternoon..hadn't caught up with him in YONKERS so it was really good to see him again..got to say a quick YO to Jazzi too! =)=) Then ahhh, I got to have a veg-out night last night..=) Dont you love it when you get to have one of those after being busy every other night of the week? Snuggling up, with my pj's and slippers and a hot water bottle in front of the TV..or reading a book..=). I was to tired last night, but almost didn't want to go to sleep...because waking up would mean having to face the horrid dentist today! AH! Its only a check-up, but I reallllly really hate going to the dentist..mainly because of that disgusting fluoride stuff they smear all over your teeth..and they pretend that it's a delicious 'strawberry' flavour, but even the thought of it makes me want to vomit..gah..:S. Not to worry..after this one its not another check-up for at least a year, thank goodness! After that I'm off to prac..which I wont finish till 10pm tonight! But I'm really loving it..learning heaps, and my poor patients have been so beautiful, despite being unwell :(. 
Till then, my stinky lil people..:)"

"event","Ahhh home sweet home..can't wait to get into my nice, warm, snuggly bed..ahhh :) Today I worked all day at the cheesy cheesecake shop, and then came home, and went straight to youth group! I learnt how to make the cheesecakes today!! haha :) In the past, I have just done the decorating on the cakes..but now my boss is getting me to do the cooking aswell...ahh fun fun..except I find myself wanting to eat all the cakes all the time..mm..not so good..haha :). I am heaps keen to go on a bushwalk tomorrow..little Ads is gonna come with me! :) I LOVE bushwalking!! It was so so beautiful when we went on a walk at Wentworth falls 2 weekends ago..God's creation is amazing!! We are so blessed to be living in Australia..:)

Gah, I should probably go get some sleep..am so tired for some reason! I think my lack of sleep this past week is catching up on me..I was so tired last night when Ads was over..I started talking rubbish at one stage because I must have been half asleep..my sock had fallen off, and I was confused as to where it was, but for some reason blurted out ""..my sock!..it is finished!""..resulting in Ads cacking at me...hehe :) ahhhhh dear :) I've had this annoying cough and sore throat over the past week or so, and it tends to just reappear at night..mm..croaky voice..:S..
Anyway, must get to rest! My plan is to go for a run tomorrow morn..hmm..I think that's just wishful thinking, haha :)

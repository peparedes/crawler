"event","I'm sitting here.. In my room. I have a headache and I can't sleep. I never can sleep this early. I don't know why. I just can't. I have a headache because my mom was just yelling at me. I really don't feel like cutting for once. So I start writing a story. A story much like this one. The difference is that story will never finish. I don't really cry much but half way through the first chapter tears start streaming down my face. They taste salty. I'm mad now. I hate when I cry. So I decided to turn off the laptop. I get the prompt save? yes or no. I click no, the less I have about me in writing the better. Its not safe I use to keep a diary I wrote in everyday till I found out my sister read it every day. So I have a headache, I can't sleep, and now, after spilling tears all over my face, I'm angry. I hate myself in fact. I can't even stand to look at my weak face in the mirror. I start cleaning my room. I'm not going to lie to you. I really want to cut right now. Sometime I found out it helps if you clean. So thats what I start doing. I get out the antibacterial spray, paper towels, I get my vacuum, and Windex. I start cleaning first I pick up all the clothes. Then organize books (mine and the libraries). That was my mistake. I found my old shaver on the ground and realize its still in its plastic to keep the blades together while I shave. So start to take them out. I tell myself I'm just going to take them out. So thats what I start doing. The metal is pretty. I'm obsessed with the color the feel even under the stuff on my floor its cold. I don't normally cut my arms, but after feeling the metal. I roll up my hoodie sleves and put the blade to my skin. All the while I'm singing to All American Rejects. Its like I don't even realize what I'm doing. Sense the blade is almost new it cuts my flesh like a knife through butter. When I'm done after about 6 cuts later I look down at my arm. I don't feel the guilt now I just see the crimson blood. I'm in an odd mood so I decide to use my blood and right HELP on my arm. In the background my cd starts to skip. Its like a bucket of ice water. First I deal with the cd. Then the drying blood on me with the usual baby wipe. Band-Aid the cuts. Now I feel very sleepy so I stop cleaning. Get on my Jim Jams. Slip into bed. In a numbing forgetting sleep."

"event","My Mom is yelling. She always yells at me. I'm use to it, but sometimes she can still make me sad. I moved upstairs to my room. I move fast almost running. I get the door. I'm glad it locks. For a minute or two I try to fighting back the urge. I guess I'm not that strong because the urge washes over me. I feel the want all the way from my finger tips to my toes. I know I wont be okay till I hurt myself enough to ease my nerves and dry any tears that threaten to cloud my vision or spill down my face. I move over to my desk. In my room I hide my razors between two Bibles. Who is ever going to look there. Nobody so its safe. I slide the first Bible of the shelf on my desk grab my razor and replace the book. I move like a robot. My actions are automatic. I can feel the chill of the metal in my hand. I dream of cutting and now its going to happen. I move back to the door and lean against it. My body slides to the floor. I roll my pant leg up, and just for a min I gaze over the graveyard of bad memories. I run the razor over my skin. Pick a nice spot of smooth skin. Over and over again I start cutting into my flesh. Staring into the nothing of my mind. Finally I am satisfied with the damage I have sliced into my body. I stop cutting and just gaze as my red blood starts pooling on my skin. I sit for fifteen minutes just staring before I come back to reality. I start cleaning the blood of. Band-Aid the cuts. Close my eyes and jest breath. Open my eyes roll my pant leg back down, put my smile back on and start counting again."

"event","I look at my watch 12:00 o'clock 25 more minutes before I get out of class. Passing period is between 4th and 5th is the only time I feel comfortable cutting in the bathroom. L Hall bathroom is always empty so I can get a stall that locks. Just check my watch again 12:15 10 more min. I'm digging in my back pack... well not really digging just getting into. I already know where my razor is. I keep it in the same place. Nobody would ever guess to to look where it is. I slip my razor which is now in my hand into my pocket. 12.24... one more min the bell will soon ring. I will finally be able to do what I have been craving to do all day long. Thats the bell. I'm already packed up. I practically run from the class room. Razor in pocket. I walk to the Bathroom. This might seem odd but I always go to the same stall. I move into the stall lock the door. My back pack slides from my shoulders and hits the floor. I put my foot on the toilet seat, roll my pant leg up, slide the razor out of my pocket. I start the process of searching my leg for a spot not already scared. I find a spot the razor slide through my skin. The cold metal is like a dash of cold water dowsing my on coming breakdown. My teeth clench not in pain. In restraint. It takes all my myself control not to slice to deep. I cut first one line, then two, three until I'm finally satisfied. I watch the crimson blood spill down my white skin for a time. Feeling the calm run through my whole body. I'm digging in my back pack again. I get out a wipe to clean the blood off. I slap a band-aid on the cuts. I roll my pant leg back down. Fix a smile on my face and start counting the minutes till I cut again."

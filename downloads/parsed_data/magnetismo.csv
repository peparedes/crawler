Take my advice; I don't use it anyway.

A clean desk is a sign of a cluttered desk drawer.

Then I drove to Katy to buy a new speedo :O) from this old old dude who has owned this swim shop forever & remembers me form when i was like 3.  Anyways, he sold me a new suit for 50% off (YESSS!) so it was like 30$ instead of 75% he hooked it up!!

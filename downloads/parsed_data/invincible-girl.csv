Carls here with me...we're having a beautiful beautiful night in. Hot chocolate and sex and dreams and the hopes and fears and songs we twist between each other.

God I love him so much."

"event","Today has been strange, passed by me in a bit of a dreamlike haze..

Did u guys enjoy the other night? I've got the pics back! I felt a bit scared to tell you the truth, especially after all the crap my ex gave me the other day, phoned me up...basically calling me names etc etc. I don't know...I guess its hard to be confident with yourself sometimes...

Carl reahearsed all day and night yesterday and today for the gig on thurs... and I really miss him. I'm so horny too... I want some girls...beautiful, gorgeous girls. Kissing girls is so fucking sexy, their beautiful bodies, tongues slipping softly between each others lips, feeling their boobs, feeling down to the fucking sexy gorgeous wetness....mmmmmmmm tastes soooo good. Hehe. I'm feeling bad tonight! 
I miss katie....

"event","Last night was amazing... I went over to Carls, and I arrived too early, he said he'd be back at 8, I got there at 7...I had a whole hour to wait for him...

When he finally walked through the door, I couldn't believe how glad I was to see him, we didn't even say hello, we just kissed and I lost myself in him, I love it I love it I love it...But I don't love him...

Do you think thats strange? I mean of course I love him but I'm not IN love with him. I love him as I love all of you. We have the most amazing sex, I can't stand to be without him, but I'm not in love with him. Sometimes I think I'm crazy.

Well diary it was beautiful! I love his body - I've missed it so much. I've missed his little smile as he starts to undress me, the little smile that shows he KNOWS he's the only one who can make me feel that good. I've missed his hair,his brown eyes, I've missed him being inside me, god I love it when he's inside me...I've missed the amazing way we connect, you can't get any better than that, having someone inside you feeling their pulse mixed with yours, heart beats beating together, fast, irregular, breathing quicker, moans....

It was beautiful. I want him to know how much I loved it. I wish he read this. Bloody non computer using bastard. :)

Love you all. x"

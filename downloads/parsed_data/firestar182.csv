"event","Today I found out that someone I go to high school with committed suicide.  Wow, what a sentence to start a journal post with, huh?  And I didn't know her well, not hardly at all.  She was older than I am and I was actually in the same grade with her younger brother.  But we went to church together and camp together and basically grew up together.  It's just strange...it makes me wonder what on earth could be that bad.  She left behind a sweet husband and three precious children.

Which leads me to the subject...while things have been bad in my life, I've been through a lot of crap, and I've thought maybe it would just be better not to have to deal with any of this anymore, I've never thought that committing suicide was the answer, just because I've always thought about what that aftermath would be.  What would that do to my mother, my father, my grandparents, my friends, and all those people I love.  How could *I* do that to them?  How could *I* voluntarily hurt them like that?  What would be so bad in my life that I could do something like that to the people I love?  And I understand that people who commit suicide are usually dealing with mental illness, but I think that it's so hard to understand why sometimes.  I think sometimes when I haven't had the will to live, it's been the people that I love in my life that have kept me going.  I've lived for them, for my family, for my friends, for my patients because THEY need me to live...not because *I* need me to live.  I can only imagine though if I didn't have those people that loved me when I was at rock bottom...I'd might not still be here.  If I didn't have something besides myself to live for...I would have thought that not living anymore might be a good idea also.  I don't know...

Anyway, my thoughts are with her family tonight.  I hope and pray that they are able to find peace and that they know that she loved them and that this is not their fault.  Be at peace.

Thoughts?"

"event","Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.  I know, I know, I'm sorry, my utter laziness has prevailed when it comes to livejournal and posting recently.  I just haven't had much to say that was appropriate for public knowledge lately.  I have been however trolling all of your journals reading about your daily lives.  Lets see, what can I come up with to rant about today...

Facebook status updates...the BANE of my existence on occasion.  Now, just like every soul on the world wide web I like to know what's going on with other people, but there are some people that take the status update to the extreme.  I don't need to know when you put the brownies in the oven and then again when you take them out.  I don't need to know when your child goes poo in the potty.  I don't care about your kids and what funny/cute things they do everyday(if it's once and awhile, fine), but I certainly don't want to see new pictures EVERY day.  I totally get that you love your kids, and I'm glad really because you should love them...but there's a limit.  Having a picture of your baby as your profile picture...well, I don't know what to say about that...it annoys me almost as much as wedding pictures for profile pictures.  Offenses such as these cause me great irritation and I have taken to a new practice...un-friending people because I just can't stand it.  OH, also, complaining about politics on your status updates and saying things like ""the president is an idiot, etc."" will also be voted off my Facebook island.  I am a liberal feminist and there are many things that make my inner woman DIE...any of these things, and you will be removed...unless, your one of my IRL friends and I'll probably just tell you that you're being retarded.  Like I say, not everyone annoys me.  Some of my friends that I know well, post pictures of their kids and tell stories and it doesn't bug me.  I guess that's just the problem with getting old...EVERYONE has kids now, so they are all over my facebook page.

Anyway, moving on...work has been crazy stressful lately.  We're going through a huge upheaval...and everyone is really stressed out, which sucks.  Hopefully, it will get better soon.  I'm needing it to get better soon before I completely lose it.  haha.

Well, I'm in Nashville this week.  Which is wonderful.  I've been able to go shopping and hang out with my family, which I love to do.  So, I'm hoping I'll be nice and relaxed when I get back.  Ah, well, that's all I've got to say about that."

"event","I have just arrived back home from a divine trip to Disney World...the happiest place on earth.  It's a magical place. 
Anyway, I was enlightened and surprised while there to find that there were not very many Americans in the happiest place on earth.  In fact, I saw a woman there...at DisneyWorld...in a Burka.  Yes, friends, a Burka and I was so ENRAGED by it because the mummification of women in black fabric is not just a Religious gesture but a symbol of the unbelieveable oppression of women today.  We are now living in the year 2009, and to think that some women are still forced to completely cover every inch of their body except for their eyes with black fabric because of some Religious extremist who apparently cannot control their sexual urges is atrocious and sickening to me.  Because these women are completely void of any identity and completely cut off from society by their religion.  If you read about Islam, and about the teachings of Muhammad, you will not find the teaching of oppression of women and treating others like cattle.  I'm sickened that this is still happening in our world today and it makes me desire to go to these countries and educate them on women's rights.  UGGGH! Angry.

Anyway, DIsney World was fun.  My mom and I are completely awesome at getting things done, and we have Disney down to a science...haha.  We rode all the rides we wanted to, ate all the food we wanted to, and had a blast.

I wonder sometimes what I ever did to the world to deserve what happens in my life.  Like, seriously, why me?  I wish that something could happen and fix everything, but the fact of the matter is that I have to fix it.  I can't just sit around and whine and complain and expect for the world to come to me.  I have to go to it and I have to buck up and realize that I've obviously made some bad decisions.  Decisions which have hurt me alot but were learning experiences and I'm therefore grateful for them.  I wish so much that I could have the things that I want, but I can't and I have to live with that because getting those things would be selfish and wrong.  Anyway, I'd like for something good to happen to me, that's all.*end pity party whining*"

"event","Not really, I just don't have internet at my house right now.  Anyway, I must say that another interesting year has passed.  You see, around this time last year, I was separating from my husband, meeting a new friend...and going through what some would call a complete emotional meltdown.  And it's taken me about a year to get my shit together, but now I feel as though I'm finally emotionally whole again and in a really good place in my life.  I got rid of the new friend that ended up shattering me far more than the husband and sucking my soul dry of anything good that I had, and I am pretty much back to being crazy happy Megan.  I currently feel as though the world has come full circle.  And I must say that on the one year anniversary of my hanging out with my friend...I went to play tennis with someone else.  It was freeing to know that I'm finally emotionally transformed into this much stronger and happier human being.

Anyway, all of that being said.  I got to watch a liver transplant...and pick up the liver that they took out of my patient's body.  It was the coolest thing...ever."

"event","Last night, I am sitting on my couch in my pajamas watching episodes of Doctor Who that I had recorded on my DVR and all of a sudden there is a knock on my door.  I'm like...""Qua? It's almost midnight...who is knocking at my door?""  So, I trot my happy ass over to the door, almost fall over Pippin (who is having a spaz-attack because OMGSOMEONEKNOCKEDONTHEDOOR), and answer it.  Anyway, I probably should have listened to Pippin...but I thought it was one of YOU GUYS, showing up at my house at all hours of the night.

So, there is the older lady who is like leaning on the door (so when I open it she almost falls on top of me) and she's like...CAN YOU HELP ME????  And I'm thinking wow it smells like a bottle of Wild Turkey out here. So, I'm like what's wrong and she's like...I CAN'T GET OUT!!!  and then she stops and she's like...""I NEED A LIGHT!"" and then she proceeds to attempt to push past me into my house.  I was like Oh, HELL no, you did NOT just do that.  And all this time I'm like, Stupid Megan, why did you answer the door?  Anyway, so, I explain to her at least five times that she has to drive around the complex.  About that time...my stupid idiot cat runs out the door between my legs and runs all over the entryway to my building...after five minutes of chasing her around I finally catch her and go into my house and ponder whether or not I should call the police.  I decide to look out my second bedroom window and see if she's out there.  Then she almost rams her car into mine and gets stuck again, comes back inside and starts banging on my door going on about how she was at a Monopoly game at her friends house and she just needs to go home.  I decide not to answer the door but that maybe I should call the police  She then leaves and gets her car unstuck and turned around and drives off.  I was like OMG, what to do...  

It was a bizarre experience.  I mean really, who DOES that???"

"event","Hark!  An update from...yours truly.  I know all of my faithful readers and fans have been waiting with baited breath to hear about my latest adventures, but to be completely honest there has been a fat lot of nothing that has changed.  So, I wasn't going to bore you all with my endless droning about the damn hospital. 

However, I finally do have news to report other than the fact that I am freaking awesome...haha, kidding, kidding.  

My news, I am in Arkansas at my cousins abode.  I drove here today being closely followed by my mother who has been in Oklahoma City hanging out with me for the past week.  Tonight we went to a place on Dickson Street called Brewski's and I ordered a rum and coke...well, I ended up with a glass full of rum with a spash of coke and a few ice cubes.  I mean it was clear almost...very lightly tinged brown.  I gratefully inhaled that and now I have a headache...go me.  But then we went to a coffee shop and had butterscotch coffee.  Anyway, I'm going to go see my horse tomorrow and ride her, which I am uber-excited about doing and hang out with my aunt and uncle.  My uncle has been in the hospital apparently his potassium got really high and his kidneys aren't doing so great because of all of his immunosuppression from his transplant years ago, but he seems to be doing just fine now...for the time being.

IN all seriousness, my mom's dog, Gizmo, passed away Thursday night.  He was a part of the family and he will be greatly missed by all.  He was a precious sweet baby and one of the most incredible dogs I've ever known.  He was 12 years old and had been sick for the past few months, so I am glad that he isn't suffering anymore.  

Okay, I'm going to bed before I divulge anymore verbal diarrhea onto livejournal."

My friends tell me I'm pretty, funny, smart, talented, etc., but they way other people react to me...I just seem to make them want to walk away.  Ah well, what to do?

In other news, I was woken up at 9 am by the electrician...apparently, my house is going to go up in flames at any moment.  He pulled the cover off the breaker box and there is now a black streak on my wall where it like blew up or something.  He is coming back later when Paul is here.  OY.

You see, I'm having this period of self improvement and self discovery right now (which I a story for a whole other post).  Anyway, Part of this process is that I have started to exercise.  I wake up and exercise every morning before work...straight from the bed to the treadmill, and then in the evenings I work the punching bag on my new Wii.  Anyway, this past week, I got up and went to the workout room here in my complex at 445 like usual.  

I get on the treadmill and I start by walking...so, I walk then run then walk then run...and I work up to where I run full out for about a quarter of a mile.  Well, I'm on my last run...running full out and I'm getting really really tired.  So I'm pushing through...pushing pushing pushing, I close my eyes because it's easier to push through it that way, and BAM, all of a sudden I am ON THE FLOOR in the splits straddling the treadmill and my left knee is all kinds of scraped up.  I mean really, I fell of the treadmill.  WHO DOES THAT?  ME...cause I'm a moron.  Ah well, whatever.  Now you all know.

Anyway, moving on, work was fantastically frustrating today.  I was on the verge of murdering my patient by the time I left...I do believe that if I had to go in her room one more time...I might have actually acted out my pillow therapy fantasy that I'd been harboring all day.

I find it hard to have compassion for a person who has done something to themselves...you made your bed, now lay in it.  Wow, I'm all about the sayings tonight.

I make it ok to Target, turn in and all of a sudden, I'm sliding sideways instead of driving forward...right into the curb.  I now am the proud owner of a neat red gash mark on the hub of my front driver wheel.  However, I persevere on, unwilling to allow a thing such as ice to deter me.  I park my car and begin to hike across the parking lot.  The hiking suddenly turned into skating which suddenly turned into me almost falling on my ASS multiple times which resulted in an aching side from trying to balance.  I did not however bite it...if you will.  So, all of that is to say that the weather here is...abysmal, and now there is like an inch of ice/sleet/snow crap on the ground which I get to drive in since I chose a profession in which there are no ""snow days"".  Yay, the excitement is overwhelming..."

<lj-cut text=""Lyrics to a Kate Nash song that I looooooooove"">

<bold>The Nicest Thing</bold>
All I know is that you're so nice,
You're the nicest thing I've seen.
I wish that we could give it a go,
See if we could be something.

I wish I was your favorite girl,
I wish you thought I was the reason you are in the world.
I wish my smile was your favorite kind of smile
I wish the way that I dressed was your favourite kind of style.

I wish you couldn't figure me out,
But you always wanted know what I was about.
I wish you'd hold my hand when I was upset,
I wish you'd never forget the look on my face when we first met.

I wish you had a favorite beauty spot that you loved secretly,
'Cos it was on a hidden bit that nobody else could see.
Basically, I wish that you loved me,
I wish that you needed me,
I wish that you knew when I said two sugars, actually I meant three.

I wish that without me your heart would break,
I wish that without me you'd be spending the rest of your nights awake.
I wish that without me you couldn't eat,
I wish I was the last thing on your mind before you went to sleep.

All I know is that you're the nicest thing I've ever seen.
I wish that we could see if we could be something.
I wish that we could see if we could be something.
</lj-cut>

Anyway, I recently rediscovered this song on my Kate Nash album and I just realized how much I love it.  I hadn't ever really listened to the lyrics before...love love love.

In other news, today I figured out how to use Skype and I talked to my Dad and Stepmom over the computer...having a built in webcam on my macbook is SO nice.  I just love this new computer...possibly too much since it seems that I spend way too much time on it now.  haha.  Nonetheless, that was pretty swell.  I also went to the zoo with Abbey and Shanon today.  We had tons of fun...and, yes, I know that it is the middle of winter.  Ah well, it was pretty warm out."

So, my birthday was wonderful.  We had cheesecake and went to Queen of Sheba which is an ethiopia restaurant and SO GOOD. 

Today I got talked into going to work.  haha. Which is fine, I really wasn't doing anything anyway.  

So, in other news, I continue to play with fire in my life...There are things in life that you KNOW are NOT a good idea but you do them anyway.  I fail at life, but I'm hell-bent on doing things my way, as I always am.  To be completely honest, I'm happy with things.  I don't know...blah.

Also, I worked today.  Luckily, Amy was there so I got to hang out with her some.  I don't know WHAT I'm going to do when she goes on maternity leave...I'll be left by myself with the psychotics.  I was taking care of this poor little lady that had a stroke.  Sometimes those types of patients just make me SO sad because I mean really where is the quality of life.  That is the thing about my job, sure I might be able to save someone, revive them enough to send them to the floor, or even get them well enough to go home, but really what IS that patient's quality of life.  It's quality of quantity in my book, if I'm going to be a vegetable forever or if I'm not going to be able to get out of bed or move around or experience life...send me on my way.  I'm just not interested in living like that.  I mean, I'm not saying that I'm ready to die today or anything, but...I just think it would be terrible to lay in the bed for ages and ages and ages.

We had dressing, asparagus casserole, some vegetables that we cooked in with the turkey, fruit salad, and cranberry sauce.  SO that was awesome.

This evening we went to the movie theatre and saw ""Australia"".  OH. MY. GOD.  I loved it SO much and I want to see it again already.  This movie was three hours of Baz Lurhman glory...ah-mazing.  WOW, and I mean not World of Warcraft...just WOW, in the now infamous words of Katherine.

"event","Of course on occasion I get these random thoughts in my brain which usually entail the nature of love, relationships, and life's other mysteries.  In any case, I often find myself sitting in front of a blank LJ ""Post an Entry"" screen unable to put the jumble that is in my head down onto the screen in an organized enough fasion for it to make sense.  Then again sometimes it doesn't even make sense to me.  Oy. Anyway.

So, I was sitting here thinking about relationships primarily those that I've just recently put to rest(some of you know of what I speak, and others of you, sorry but I'm not giving out details) and how I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong in life.  Seriously, I seem to have the worst sense in the world and somehow believe that things that are most certainly a BAD idea at the time are a GREAT idea.  I almost always set myself up for some sort of severe emotional pain which drives my self-esteem even lower than it already is.  To say the least, I tend towards people who won't treat me with love and respect and who often refuse to even try to make me feel good about myself.  Frankly, I'm pretty fun and cool and whatnot so I guess I don't get the interest in making me feel like uber-shit all the time.  Maybe it's just a male thing. That is all said to preface this next statement...which is that I'm fucking tired of the bullshit and I'm going to be open and blunt from now on.  I'm so blunt with people on a regular basis but when it comes to guys and my heart I'm like a little clam and I just don't say anything.  I've got some serious issues related to the way I've been treated for years and it just seems that people continue to treat me that way.  SO, it must be ME and not them if it's a continual thing.  I don't know.  This is some serious verbal diarrhea and I know it doesn't make sense.  I'm tired, but SO happy to be off work.  So, anyway, I'm sure that I might gain some sense of coherence later on in the day and make a post that is understandable."

I of course have to park the Action German Car out in BFE and so here I go through the artic from my car all the way into the hospital.  While the walk is usually quite refreshing, the DAMN Oklahoma wind was killing me because frankly, I might as well have been bare assed in my thin as paper scrubs.  SO, my upper half was warm (with my two shirts, sweatshirt, and jacket) but then my ass was frozen.  Ah well, cest la vie.

My patient, who I've been busting my balls on for a week now, died today.  His family decided to withdraw care and so that was an all day process.  I know that it's better for the patient but sometimes I feel like I failed them.  I totally know that it's not about me and that I've done everything possible and that I just can't save everyone in the world...it's still hard not to feel that way.  He was so sick and wouldn't have wanted to live like that and what not but dude, I don't know...sucks.  It's been rough up there lately...damn the holidays.  

AH well, in other news, I've decided to hate boys and to never trust them again.  Like that's new news.  There MUST be something wrong with me since I seem to repel every person who has a Y-chromosome.  Oh well, whatever...I am typically much better off with my two X chromosomes to keep me company.  :)  Also, my uterus officially sucks.

My patient today was SO funny.  It was nuts up there in 701 and I just had the one patient because I was running an NO study today.  Dr.Bag really likes me to do the NO studies because I'm so incredibly OCD that I make him little packets and hilight information and do my crazy Obsessive things that make his life MUCH easier.  Anyway, Vicki was having trouble with her patient and I had finally emerged from my patient's room and was standing at the nurses station when I looked at the monitor and Vicki's patient's heart rate was dropping.  It went from 80 to 60 to 40 and at that point I sprinted across the unit to get the crash cart and went flying with it to her patient's room.  In which I jumped into the middle of the action and started doing some bad ass chest compressions, until too many people go in there and I got light-headed from being surrounded by too many Oxygen wasters who weren't doing anything.  So I went to check on my patient, who's room I had run by with the crash cart and I was like...""How are you?""  She looks at me with a straight face and says ""Better than THAT guy.""  I just died laughing.  Anyway, she was like ""They've shocked him six times so far, how many times are they going to shock him?""  I felt bad that she had to hear it but she was totally just curious about the whole hullabaloo.  We almost coded two other patients today too, and it wasn't even a full moon.  I hate that.  But I had a good day, and I sent my patient home...so they sent me home at 5.  I've just been chillin.  I'm so glad because I was starting to think that there was some sort of conspiracy that made me have really bad days at work...ALL the time.  I had time to sit and chat with my best work buddy even.

On the eve of my departure from Oklahoma to begin my journey in the sunny sunny Caribbean, I chose to take a shopping trip to the mall. I was in need of a few items for my excursion to the tropics and so I took myself to the mall. I found that I needed to use the restroom as we all do from time to time and so I removed my iPhone from my back pocket and set it on the toilet paper holder. In my haste I abandoned my phone and when I returned it was gone. I went to security, I went to the customer service desk (the representatives were entirely too busy selling gift cards to concern themselves with my plight)...the phone was GONE. It is still gone.


I know, you all are saying, why would you leave your iPhone laying around, you idiot? Well, that is in fact the question my friends. I am uncertain as to my level of consciousness at the time of the abduction of my iPhone but you all can rest assured that I will be more careful from now on with such items of importance in my life. However, the loss of my phone has allowed me freedoms of which I have scarcely dreamed of before. I am enjoying being unreachable in a way, but I am ready to have a phone back and stop being tied to the internet for all of my friendly interaction."

Anyway, all of that is a preface to say that I attempted to build a fire last night in the fireplace, so we could watch movies and drink hot cocoa or in my case, hot cider and knit and be all warm and cozy and happy.  Well, I did get my fire built but it was after much brouhaha and ado.  I forgot to open the flu at first, so I got the starter log lit and I started to pile up real logs on the starter log and then I lit a pinecone firestarter thing also.  Yeah, all or nothing, two different firestarters...damnit the fire was going to burn.  Well then I realized that I needed to open the flu...so I had to climb into the fireplace (with the fire) and open it.  I'm glad I wasn't wearing any perfume or hairspray, I would have gone up in flames.  Then it kept going out so I had to poke it, and tend it...and I finally gave up.

SO anyway, this one time, my dear friend JediAbicus called me up and asked me if I wanted to go on a cruise with her.  So I said sure, why not, it'll be fun.  It's been 8,000,000,000 years since I've been on a cruise and I haven't REALLY been on vacation this year...so, sure.  Well, we planned it...Abbey did most of the work, I was just the lemming that was going where I was told.  We decided to go on Carnival Cruise Lines and I have always wanted to go to Belize and Roatan Island.  So away we went.

Here's a summary of my trip:
Got on the boat
Had an orgy with the crew: Jose had some nice abs
Got drunk and fell off the boat into the Gulf of Mexico
Had to be rescued by the Coast Guard
Almost got eaten by a shark
Was assaulted in Belize
Ate a Turtle, a Rat, and a crew member named Jose
Caught Malaria, Dysentary, and Yellow Fever
Was given a sugar cube laced with X
Subsequently found myself naked onstage singing Bonnie Tyler songs
Finally realized that I am TOTALLY KIDDING, well...except for the parts about Jose

<lj-cut text=""The real story"">

We got to Tampa Florida last Sunday (December 6) and we had no real plan of action other than knowing we needed to be ON the boat by 3 the following day and that we should probably find somewhere to sleep for the night.  So after much brouhaha and ado we did eventually find somewhere to stay that had free transportation from the Airport and to the MALL...which is a terrible thing for me as well you all know.  The next day we caught a transport to the Pier where we stood in line (which became a very common occurrance, made it through customs and ONTO the CARNIVAL LEGEND.  We went and ate the shit out of the buffet, no really I had like three plates of food, drank some terrible beverage called the Fun Ship Punch...yeah, not so fun there, explored and then went to bed...because we were like that and totally ""above"" all of the activities.  Oh, we did eat in the restaurant that fist night and it was the last time we did that...we were so not interested in the whole waiter/sit down and eat/wait for a table kind of thing.

The next day was our ""fun day at sea"" which meant that we basically sat on our asses(mine of the fat, Abbey's of the in shape).  I did have a massage at 8 am in which I was slathered in seaweed paste and wrapped in aluminum foil.  I was just waiting to be put in the sauna and microwaved or made into sushi or...well there were about a hundred ways that I saw my death as imminent at that particular moment.  I was then given the rub down after they hosed the seaweed paste off of me and strongly persuaded(in which I mean, forced) to buy some overpriced spa products(which I accidentally left in my carry-on luggage and so they are still in Tampa at the airport, or in some TSA workers bathroom...you know they take all that shit).  Anyway, we had a busy busy day of doing all of about nothing.  I do believe that we got to see some poor men humiliated by being forced to wear a bikini top and sarong and dance around...though they did volunteer.  I sat in the hot tub, ate some dinner, did some shopping...you know how it goes.  Abbey was plagued with seasickness for most of the evenings that we were out at sea...so I spent alot of time wandering around the boat aimlessly with my book and iPod...because I can't fucking sit still to save my life.

We anchored in Grand Cayman on the 9th, and we had to transfer from our boat to a smaller boat(called a tender) to get to shore.  We did a Best of Cayman Islands tour (which sounds hokey, I know) that was super uber spendiferously cool.  Our guide, Billy, drove us all over Grand Cayman and I rode shotgun which was infinitely better than sitting in the back of the bus.  We went to Seven Mile Beach, the Cayman Turtle Farm(where I picked up a turtle), the Tortuga Rum Cake Factory, and Hell(where we met the Devil).  NO really...this place was called Hell.  It was very cool.

We went to Cozumel the next day and I totally swam with a dolphin named Louis...who was like the most kick ass dolphin ever in the history of dolphins.  That was one of the coolest things I've ever done in my life.  We shopped in Cozumel and I didn't have my card for getting some free earrings at ""Tanzanite International"" but I did have a low cut shirt on and I used my ample cleavage to get Abbey and I the hook up.  Anyway, I got hit on alot in Mexico...which is not surprising and Abbey's tattoo was photographed often by many Mexicans.  I bet the next time I go down there...her tattoo is going to be all over the place.  We did go into Diamonds International to get my free charm(do you see a pattern here) and as I was rummaging around in my backpack the salesgirl saw my bath and body works lotion and was like I LOVE BATH AND BODY WORKS...so I was like well I have an absurd amount of bath and body works lotion so I gave it to her.  She was like the happiest person...ever.  It was quite amusing.  So next time I go to mexico...I now know that I should take Bath and Body Works with me to give away.

The next day we docked in Belize and I thought that it would be so much nicer there than it actually was.  It was pretty impoverished looking and it seemed to be far more underdeveloped than I assumed it would be.  I don't know...anyway, we saw some Mayan ruins and I climbed to the top of the temple and thought I might have a myocardial infarction from the height of it and the fact that there was no railing to keep me from careening off the side of the temple.  There was no careening though...I'm fine, well as fine as I ever am.  So that was cool...but seriously, the ruins were really really neat.  Getting there...not so neat.  You see, we were in a bus, like a tour bus...big bus.  The road it was narrow, and by narrow think of a small gravel drive kind of narrow.  This bus had to go down this road that was filled with potholes and all sorts of obstacles...oh yeah, and it was a two way road.  HA.HA.HA.  That's all I have to say about that.  Well I could also talk about the tender boats in Belize because I was most certain that I was going to die, perish, pass away, expire, and any other number of ways to put the final end.  Abbey has a video of our boat ride...it's impressive.  We were also told that it was considered ""mild chop""  if that's mild I would hate to see moderate or severe.  

The last stop was Roatan Island, Honduras.  Now, I've been to Honduras...but I'd only been to the mainland and I was also pulling teeth and assisting with eye surgery...so I was not a tourist then, but Roatan Island is beautiful and fantastic.  Very very nice.  It was chilly that day.  SO we ended up not snorkling as planned but we did play on the beach where I froze my fat ass off...that's right folks, it's gone.  Just kidding.  Anyway, we had a blast playing in the ocean and we shopped for the last of our presents for people.  

Life on the boat was always interesting.  It never ceases to amaze me how obnoxious people can be.  You know, some of the people that we dealt with were so inconsiderate and unbelievably rude.  We went to dinner one night and had the pleasure of sitting next to a group of six who thought it necessary to yell and be so incredibly loud.  When the waiter brought them their food one of the guys started yelling ""Groceries"" at the top of his lungs.  Now Im all for having a blast when on vacation...and I can party like nobody else can but I do maintain a sense of propriety and I don't understand how people can be SO disrespectful.  Vacation is for relaxing and having fun, it's not going to be perfect because NOTHING ever is perfect, but you can always just be flexible and have a good time with it.  No harm no foul.  We got off the boat today and got onto our bus that was going to take us to the airport and the people on the bus with us did nothing but bitch the entire time we sat there about having to wait.  I mean shouldn't they be in a good mood...they just got off of vacation.  Oy, whatever.  I hate people.  I did often drag Abbey to activities such as ""Motown Trivia"" and ""80's Music Trivia"" and the singing/dancing shows(because we know I looooooove those).  There were always things to do, and I felt overwhelmed sometimes by the schedule haha...oh well.  But most of the time Abbey was feeling sick, so I went to the shows and stuff by myself...which was a very interesting experience...I'm cool with going places alone, so that was fun.

I did do kareoke(sp?) for the first time in my life...I know, I'm a singer right?  Put a microphone in front of my face that I have to hold and it just paralyzes me.  Don't ask why...I have NO idea.  Anyway, everyone was drunk in there so I decided to go for it and I just let loose.  I'm SO not used to singing pop music so I was all like this could go really well...or I could suck it up.  It was super fun though.  I will have to do that again sometime.  

The food was pretty good most of the time.  There was a free 24 hour ice cream machine which was so bad...but SO good.  The alcoholic beverages were...well, the ""special drink of the day"" was never very good.  After the third day, we stopped buying those.  I moved on to Mojitos and Daquris...which was much better.  However, I really didn't drink very much at all, unlike me...I know.

Overall, it was fun.  I'd go again.  I think it would be super fun to go with a big group next time, we should all go.

By the way, there was a group of scary lesbians that was stalking us.  haha.  I think they wanted in Abbey's pants and they couldnt decide if I was a lesbian or not.  Too bad I like penises way too much to be a lesbian...I think life might be easier sometimes if I was.  Ah, well, that's another conversation for another day.

I'm happy to be home and I'm especially happy to see my damn dog and those two idiot cats.  Paul's cats are here also, so once again, my house has become a zoo.

We are also not going to talk about how much money I spent on this trip.  Blech."

"event","Mom and I just arrived in from our mountain adventure.  Katy left yesterday because alas she must go to work on Mondays.  I find that I have much less angst here in Tennessee.  Much less drama, much less trouble.  I don't have as much here to be ""jaded"" about and being in the mountains just makes me appreciate life.  I think maybe when I get down and blue I just need to take off and go to the mountains for a day or so.  It helps me to clear my mind.  It's of course also nice to be with my mom and Katy...those two that have known me and been with me since well, forever in my mom's case and for like 12 years in Katy's case.  Haha, I can just do whatever.  Okay well blah.  I'll write more later."

I've already survived the onslaught of medical questions from various family members, including my mother who is trying to get me to diagnose her arm pain.  I tried to tell her that I don't DO bones.  If she needed an arm transplant that would be another matter...I'd be her girl but Orthopedics make me want to cry a little.  Nevertheless, it's nice to be here.  We went to my favorite Japanese Restaurant for supper and now I'm going to climb up into my big comfy bed here at the house with Pippin and watch TV and go to sleep.  We are leaving in the morning for the mountains, I am so excited to go to Gatlinburg.  :)  Other than that, last night I saw my aunt and uncle and cousins, and I got to see Miss Jolie the walking horse.  She's fat and happy which is good.  I have nothing to say really.  I'm babbling.  Until later, Au Revior."

"event","Dear Vivaldi, Sebastian, and Puddy,

I am not exactly sure what goes on at my house while I am gone, but what I do know is that when I arrive home from a long day at work, where I have worked hard so that you may be fed, my house is a mess.  For awhile, I placed the blame on Paul...thinking that he must be the cause of the atrocious mess, however, after further investigation, I have found that it must be you, you fiends.  I am sure that this is all a clever rouse for some diabolical plan, because you are cats and all cats plan to take over the world.  

Sure, when I am home you act like angels, you all lay around sleeping, but I know you hear the lock click and it's a party.  I come home and the kitchen is a mess, the living room is a mess, the dining table has ORANGE hair on it; it is worse than living with teenagers.  There are acceptable places to lay and unacceptable place.  Acceptable places: the couch, the futon, the chair, the floor, the quilt rack, and even the window or the floor.  Unacceptable places: the dining room table, the buffet, the mantle, the kitchen counter, the STOVE (why on earth would you lay on the stove?), the media center, the bookshelf, my face, the sink, etc.  Please cease and desist this feral cat activity before I am forced to find the squirt bottle.

Your loving owner."

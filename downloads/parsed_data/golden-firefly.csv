Frankly, I think it's the most ridiculous part of being a teenager.  It's so rare any of us truly fall in love, simply because we aren't mature enough to harbour feelings that strong.  You might think you love someone, but in six months' time, you'll change your mind, and then you just sound stupid.  Not to say teenagers can't love people...but we mix up and confuse and twist all our feelings until they're so mangled they completely tear away from all reality.  Who wants to listen to drivel about <i>that??</i>  I most certainly don't.

So...I started  thinking...and I think I've come to a conclusion about Love.

<lj-cut text=""Thoughts on Love"">OK, so.

Here's the theory:

There are two main situations of love: a) when you love someone and b) when you are in love.

a) When you <i>love</i> someone...
...you basically love them.  There isn't really any other way to describe it.  And your partner can totally love you back, too.  Loving someone doesn't apply to the *mutual feelings*, but rather to the feelings themselves.  Strength is not the determining factor at all: The love can be as strong as any Cinderella/Prince Charming love.  You care for a person and want to stay with him/her for the time being, but it can all burn out.  It's like...emotional lust, I suppose.  You want him/her, but not only for physical reasons, and it's a temporary desire.

b) When you are <i>in love</i>...
...you love someone, and he/she might love you back, but it's like a love that only happens once or twice in a lifetime.  It's the kind of love you see in 'The Notebook', the kind of love Disney movies are centered around.  Sometimes your first time in love is your only time in love, and sometimes you're lucky enough to get another chance, but it isn't going to happen often.  This is the love you depend on for your marriage, the love that keeps a couple together for fifty years.

So, in a sentence, I would say the summary would go as such:  Loving Someone is like puppy love: temporary, beyond the physical, and sometimes innocent, and Being in Love is like the grown-up version: where you want to stay with that person for the rest of your life, and it's nice for the feeling to be reciprocated in this case.

So the moral is: you can love someone, anytime really, but don't mix that up with <i>being in love</i>.  That'll come when you're older (usually ^__~).

And those would be my views on love.  I think it's a reasonable POV...because otherwise, what do you call those times when it's more than a crush, but you know it isn't <i>true love</i>?</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""I love to read!! Yay me"">I totally forgot how addicting reading can be when you just get sucked into a story. I mean, I'm not the world's fastest reader, so I often get to take the time to just divulge into the story. Yesterday, I read from 2-8:30 straight of <I>Wicked</I>. Of course, I didn't get that far, but it isn't the worlds fastest book to read either. The last set of books I really read included <I>The Harry Potter</I> series, but those are mostly a breeze. Although, I did fly the third part of the book pretty fast, but that was the love story part, and I am a sucker for love stories.

Anyway, I needed to take a break, watched a movie and a half to give my head some thinking rest and then continued on from 12:30-3! It is amazing how good I feel after having read almost all day yesterday. I haven't had the time to sit down and read a book all semseter so this was just thrilling. There was another incident earlier during break where I sat in the livingroom, infront of the fireplace, with the Christmas tree all lit up and a few supporting lights aiding in the lighting of the pages, and just read I was there for at least 3-4 hours, and it was glorious. Dad was ice fishing, Nik and Mom were working at Sear's and Becca was at school! It was wonderful hearing the fire crackle and being comforted by the blanket that I had snug around me. MMMMMM!</lj-cut>

In other news i was just messin' around on the web and found this <a href=""http://lisasimpson.net/interactive/mated/index2.html""> ""If They Mated: Simpson Style""</a> thing on the web. I dare you to check this out, I mean, there are some seriously disturbing images to look over, and some of the most normal looking simpson characters.

Also, on another side note, I totally got my mom and lil' sis to watch the entire <I>Firefly</I> series! I first tried to get my sis to watch it but she got bored, and then I come into the family room a day or two later and there she is watching it with my mom. I laughed so much!

That's about all I've got right now. Peace out people!"

"event","So this week hasn't been the most exciting, or productive, but are they ever...Saw <I>Walk the Line</I> last weekend. It was pretty good. Very good acting...Went to go pick up Nikki with my mom's car, and squished her, Emily, and their roomie Sarah all in the back seat, with all their crap in the trunk. Turkey day was fine, good food as always. Watched the traditional <i>Home For the Holidays</i>. Took in a movie at the cheap theater, <I>40-year-old Virgin</I>, which was so funny. A few over the top gross humar, but overall some good, cheap, cheeky fun.

Today has been very...long. It started with <lj-cut text= ""one busy morning"">one busy morning.

So, I woke up this morning to go shopping with my dad for the annual day-after-Thanksgiving-sales-everywhere-so-lets-go-and-spend-lots-of-money-that-we-don't-actually-have-but-are-going-to-spend-anyways extravaganza. Had to get up at 4 a.m.! That's right, 4 in the morning people. I was going to splurge and buy a computer at wally's world for just under 400, but when i got there we discovered that the store only 20, held them in sporting goods and there was a line of like 100 people before me, which meant that there was no way in hell that I could ever get one so we were all like, fuck this, got the 3-5 other sales items that we wanted and got the hell out of that crazy barn.

Headed over to Menard's to wait in line there, just so we could get a few items, but it went quickly enough. Dad bought me some hot chocolate, but it was too hot to drink right away. Just before 6, ran the drinks to the car so we weren't walking around with them, got into the store, got out super quick and easy, and by the time we got back to the car, cooled just enough to drink them.

Fleet farm followed by Perkins (mmmm food), quick pit stop to drop off mom's car, and then a trip to target to pick some things up there too. I bought <i> White Christmas</i> on DVD, and I bought Trivial Pursuit Pop Culture 2nd edition for super cheap. Then one last stop at Best Buy before returning home around 9:45, just in time to take a nap.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Even more shopping"">We also went shopping after Nikki got home from work today. Started with some quality dollar store raids, which resulted in a couple of wicked awesome gifts for the Christmas party! Then we headed out to Layne Bryant where I splurged and got a couple of pairs of pants, but to be fair it was totally BOGO 1/2 off!!!</lj-cut> <lj-cut text=""Shoe addiction"">Which is really a sale I should learn to say no to. Before Turkey day, I totally went shoe shopping and bought 4 pairs of shoes. 2 boots, 1 nice pair of black shoes, and one frivolous pair of super-cure pink ones! They are all to die for, especially my brown boots, they are so sexy!!!</lj-cut>

Also burned some music this week, Anna Nalick, a christmas cd and some jason mraz to add to the collection.

Plus, there is totally at least a foot of snow outside right now. My dad is so mad at the weatherman I just think it's so funny. This morning the weatherguy was all like ""Chance of getting maybe 1-2 inches, but odds are there will be no accumulation"" and so all day, as we're driving through all this slush and crud on the road from accumulated snow, he just mutters ""No accumulation my ass."" I just laugh, it's totally funny people.

Well I should wrap this up. I have to pick Rachel up around noon, but I have a few errands to do before, like taking back some unnecessary Target purchases (not the ones mentioned above) and maybe some more clothes shopping: BOGO 1/2 off at Layne Bryant is all weekend...but maybe I can talk Rach into going to see <i>Rent</i> tomorrow afternoon."

1. <a href=""http://www.facebook.com"">Facebook.com</a>. So we're totally trying to get the facebook thing spread around campus, I'm even going to write an article about it for the paper. We get to make up groups and other super fun stuff!!!

2. <a href=""http://nationstates.net"">NationStates</a> which is wicked awesome. I made up 2 countries, The Borderlands of Wooded-froggers and The Rogue Nation of Cannot Touch This. Yes, people, I went there!!!

<lj-cut text=""some school facts."">So, for the most part, my classes are awesome this year. I hate having Holley for Linguistics, but that can't be helped. she's the only one who teaches it. I love my American Short Story class, or as I like to refer to it my ASS Class (get it, it's funny) and Classics in Western Lit is pretty frickin' awesome too. Non-Verbal with North is pretty cool, learning all about what are actions and such say about us, and how we read those signs subconsciously. I didn't think that I would like Paasch's Politics, Mass Media, and Persuasion, but I do! It is so fun. We talk and debate and argue about politics, and how politics are covered. And it's a comm class!</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""I also got a job!!!"">I also got a job!!! I work about 13 hours a week with kiddies. Every morning @ Lincoln from 7-8:30 and TR @ the Y, 3:15-6. Which means I can resume my obsession with Amazon.com, but not for a while cause I totally just bought a ton of stuff on-line again!!! Seriously, let's look at the math shall we:
3 seasons of tv (Rescue me, Angel 3&4...to complete the series)
<u>+ 2 movies</u>
<B>BAD</B></lj-cut>

Also, first newspaper layout and I survived! YAY! It was really quite fun, slightly time consuming, but v. fun.

Also, also, we now have facebook.com!! I am so excited because I have wanted it for like a year. It is sweet. Plus, we all just had a super fun time doing it!

Also, also, also (hehehe, I just like how that looks). Anyways, this past weekend, my roomies and I were flipping the channels and watched this nickelodeon cartoon about an Avatar, I don't know, but they talked about my wood frogs.<lj-cut text=""WTF? What's a friggin' wood frog?""> For those who don't know, the wood frog freezes itself with the first touch of snow, organs and everything stops, but then spontaneously revives itself with the coming of spring, defrosting from the inside out.</lj-cut> in the show, he had to find some frozen wood frogs for his friends to get better, and they totally had them defrosting. It was awesome. 

Okay, enough with the also's.
I...um...<Small>also</small> started pilates @ the Y with Stan, Liz (wicked cool new girl), Alli, and Elly (who has been too sick to participate thus far.

We are also getting ready for serenity by having a Firefly-a-thon with Liz, who has yet to see the show, saw a preview for the movie, and is totally excited to watch.

Okay people, that's about it for now. The french, it beckons..."

Moving in was actually quite fun, folks hepled arrange for a while. Went shopping and folks totally gave the starting off grocery hook-up! Room is pretty sweet, if I do say so. Chillin' in the room by my lonesome. Watched all of my season one of Angel, and then went on-line last night to buy season 2....also bought Celtic woman on cd.

Having the run of hte place is pretty fun too. It's like I have my own apartment. However, I am looking forward to friends and roomies coming back too. Can only entertain myself for so long!

I guess that sums up my move-in thus far. Tuesday, Stan moves in (YAY)! So does a whole bunch of people, because we have Orientation for New Student Orientation.

Elly-face moves in Saturday.

"event","Before I begin, let me just say that I love concerts.

The Killers concert was awesome. It ran a little late, but it still rocked.

The show was supposed to start @ 8, but the opening act, Louis XIV didn't get to the stage until 8:30, and played a 45-minute set. Expecting that the set change would last 30-45 minutes, we knew that The Killers wouldn't even take the stage until 9:45, we stood around chatting it up with a couple of Annie's co-workers that we bumped into. Finally, @ around 10:15, The Killers take the stage. Now, I know that rock and roll isn't necessarily a by the clock occupation, but seriously. We found out however that their flight into the cities had been delayed, or something, so I will forgive them.

Performance wise, I dare say that they sound way better in concert. Imagine how much I love their album, multiply that by 15, and that would explain the squee of their performance. ""Andy, you're a star"" definitely took on a more tragic sound when performed live. It made me almost want to cry. Plus the new stuff that they played which will be coming out on their new album were kick-ass.

That's about all I have, I must go and start packing. Considering that I haven't even started and I move in 3 days, it might be a good idea. Okay, people, TTYL."

Just returned from a weekend at Elly's. A mighty-fine time, if I do say so myself. (By the way, Elly, I heard that song that I was talking about, the song ""Theme song"" is sung by Mahoney, Tim or Tom Mahoney, I can't really remember the first name but it's one of those.

Elly did this for me, which made me laugh....so here it is for like all 3 or 4 of you who actually read this.

In other news, must learn how to do that thing where not all of my entry shows up in thefriends section. I realize that it looks really long that way, and then even I don't want to read it.

Went camping this weekend with the family. Good fun. Fire, lake, cards s'mores, all the best things in life for me. Going to Elly's next weekend. Moving to school the following weekend.

Had a good week at work last week, always a plus. Kids were good, went to grand slam, an idoor sports thingy, and we went to a wicked cool outside water park on friday. Thursday we had a bike day, so all my little 3rd graders (same kids I worked with last summer) brought bikes and we rode around alot. Also, got paid! YAY! The next couple of weeks at work are looking good too. Comedy club, Twins game, nature center and Camp Snoopy on my last day.

I bought a whole bunch of movies last week. Willy Wonka, Wizard of Oz, Bourne Identity, Bourne Sumpremecy, Spiderman 1& 2, In Good Company, Ladder 49, and Dodgeball. Plus I bought the White Stripes album...couldn't wait to burn it so I just bought it. I also finally saw that movie from Projecty Greenlight with Shia le Beouf, Battle of Shaker Heights, and it was mighty amusing. On a slightly of the topic, but completely related in the sense that it was me spending money on stuff, I have been an amazon.com whore. I bought all 5 Harry Potter's in hardcover, cause I went out and bought 6 so I could read it, plus Angel season 1 (I was thinking of you Stan when bought it hehehe).

That's it for now.

First off, I am sorry that I haven't written in a while, but my life has seemed a little more hectic than usual, between working all day, being tired at night, car problems, finding time to hangout with the , count them, 2 friends I have here in the city, vacation, my blanket, and the stupid internet not working, I really haven't really had the time, or energy to go on-line. *lets out deep breath in exasperation and windedness*

Let me explain the sucky-ness, and the not so sucky-ness, that is my life right now...:

To start things off, it is official, my Baby Blue, she is dead. right after I poured over $100 into her for a new tire, oil change, air filter, and the nearly full tank of gas that she had in her! And that's not even including the insurance money that I had just paid my dad! So she died on me the day that my father decided to stay home and take his car in, he asked me to pull my baby into the driveway, we thought that the transmission had been slipping, (which it totally had) and it couldn't even make it up the incline into the driveway! =( Let's just say that I am depending on my family for rides to and from work right now, needing to ask to use the other vehicles anytime that I want to go out. I hate feeling that I need permission to go out. I liked having the ability to leave where-ever, whenever, I wanted! Actually, thinking about it makes me want to cry so I am moving on to another topic.

Internet has been on the fritz lately, but it's working now, so YAY!

Vacation to South Dakota was fun. Definately way prettier than N. Dakota, but it's an hour ahead, int he mountain time zone....which left me thinking...is Bismark an hour ahead, or in the same time zone as us? (bum-bum-bum)

Went to Stillwater with Katie a couple weekends ago, and on the way, hear the song Betty Davis eyes and my mind totally vid-ed it: a vid about Legolas (hehehe-imagine all the eye close-ups that there are to use) and it could start out about he and gimli, but then show scenes that could, with the right lyrical attachment, be taken as everyone in the movie falling in love with his Bette Davis eyes. i started laughing so hard, and then trying to explain it to katie...let's just say that she didn't get it.

With no car, I think I'm going to have to go to school that weekend of the 12, i think go up on Sunday, the 14, because my folks can't afford taking anymore time off of work with the Fair right around the corner...sucky. I'll be there like a whole week before school starts....AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!! As for you stan, come whenever you feel you can tolerate it. I think that Alli and I will be pretty busy on Weds and Thurs at least during the day, but I think one night that week, Jill, RaeDeen and I were planning to go out to dinner, you are more than welcome to come!
On a similar tangent off things coming up in the fall. Not having a job isn't an option this time around, so I'm going to probably head over to video max or blockbuster or something with my bike and get an application in reight-quick *note to self: bring a prepared sheet of work history as well as references* and try to save up to get a car...

Looking ahead to the conclusion of the summer, Elly, I was thinking of coming out to your place the last weekend in July, but I would have to be home Sunday night for VBS. I was just wondering if that was okay? i could try and get a mass e-mail out if need-be to invite those who can make it, but let me know. I won't do anything until I hear from you. Along those same lines, I know that we were planning on doing the labor day trip thing again this summer/fall, but with me not driving, i don't exactly what the plan will be. Definitelygoing to the lake, but whether everyone wants to go to the Fair, we can talk about. I know that I would like to, but since I'm not driving, I'd like to know what you  guys think...

okay, enough ranting for now, I hope to hear from you all soon. And I can't wait to see all my friends!!! in a place where I can say that and know that means I have to hold up at least 2 hands....

...my life is so sad!!!"

In other news, I totally got my hair cut today, I think it looks super cute, but you all will have to see for yourself. Chin-length bob, layers, and get this, bangs! Okay, to be fair, they're nose-length, wispy bangs, but I'm taking baby steps!!!

That's about it for now. No big plans for the 4th, but family outing to South Dakota is soon approaching. My van is still falling apart, but it is together enough for me to get to and from work. Planning to take it into the shop in the next week to see if they can do anything for it. 

Okay, Hope everyone has a happy holiday\. TTYL!"

Last weekend, hung with the folks, went to a double feature, enjoyed both movies for what they were worth. Sunday, Father's Day, got to give Pops presents which is always fun, then went to a movie with Nikki. Monday started work with A+, then hung out with Katie. Had some really good Chinese food, yum!!! Tuesday it was really warm, but I got to work on my tan. Wednesday was pajama day at work, WHOO-HOO!! Thursday, worked on my tan...and oh yeah SERENITY! OMG! That movie totally kicked major ass!! I loved it, plus I got to hang out with Staniel, Elly, and Stevie. I laughed so hard that night, which was supposed to sleepy time, but turned into laughing at steve do three minute summaries of movie trilogies. Friday = last day of work for a while, which is always a good thing. Picked up Annie, and had a bonfire in the back yard. Yesterday, went to Valleyfair with Annie, my sister, and her friend. Gorgeous weather, not a lot of people either, which meant lines were really short. Bettered my tan. I think that this is the tannest I've been since I lived in Vegas, which really says something. Then to calm down went to see a cheap theater movie. Today, went to see Batman Begins with the family, very good, btw. Came home, worked on my blanket, almost ready to switch to red soon, and then went to go see house of wax with Nikki and Emily.

*loudly exhales*

All in all, I must admit it was definitely one of my better weeks thus far this summer, if not in a long time.

I also heard back From Angela, and she said that both latter weekends in July wouldn't work for her to come out to Elly's so if someone else wants to pick that weekend, I'll send out an e-mail to the troops to let them know, otherwise, i can just go out and bug the Elly all by myself!

That's it for me, I think. Ashley, I hope that you are enjoying St. Cloud. Next time you come home, give me a call or at least an advanced notice, and we should try to get together."

Mmmm, hot tub, food, movies, food, shopping, food, lots and lots of funny (including Stevie's rants on, well, everything and generally funny things) and did I mention the food, home-cooked or otherwise, all of it was so good. looking forward to the next visit, hopefully, Elly won't be sick that time around...

What else is happening, found out that the White Stripes will be playing the Orpheum in August, the first weekend after school starts...

Browsing the web, and found that <a href=""http://www.emorangers.com/"">emo is really funny.</a> Seriously go take a look. Some Brits are going to have a good time making money off of angst-ridden teenagers everywhere.

My blanket that I'm making is coming along, just another 3 skeins and I will be done, so cute...

okay people, i love you bub-bye"

"event","Okay people,
Trust me, I am the first person to acknowledge the fact that my life is less than entertaining for most people, including myself most of the time, but things are beginning to look up.

1. I got a job to last me until the real one kicks in. Just a few hours in the morning working with the kiddies and then my day is free. Early to mid June the full-time work with the kiddies begins, and the field trips this summer look really, really fun.

2. Basilica Line-up was announced. Not sure if I want to go the first night, but the second night looks promising:
<Center><B><Font size=+2>Friday, July 8th</Font>
<I>Windsor Canadian Stage</I></B>
Tegine (formerly Flavor)
Big Head Todd
Gear Daddies
<B><I>Star Tribune Stage</I></B>
MN Band Winner
Pete Yorn
Better Than Ezra 
   
<B><Font size=+2>Saturday, July 9th</Font>
<I>Windsor Canadian Stage</I></B>
Olympic Hopefuls
Carbon Leaf
Wallflowers
<B><I>Star Tribune Stage</I></B>
MN Band Winner
Marc Broussard
Blue Merle </Center>
Tickets are only like $20 for 1 night, $50 for 2, so both nights is still a possibility.

3. I got tickets to go see the Killers in August. Standing room @ Roy Wilkinson's auditorium...Annie and I are going to go....so excited.

4. Went to see mid-night showing of Star Wars...lots of people dressed up, plus my first mid-night show, time well spent (considering I only got 2 1/2 hours of sleep for that night before I had to wake up and get ready for work)

5. Plus trying to orchestrate my getting to Elly's (which is tougher than one would think...)

That's about it people, it was nice to keep you all up to date, try and talk to ya later..."

"event","So for Mother's Day, went to go see <i>Fever Pitch</i> with mom and lil' sis, and found the movie not only super cute, but Jimmie Fallon, not so annoying. Well worth it, I recommend to all.

Secondly, it is only the fifth day of summer break and I have already watched 5 movies + their special features, plus I watched 2 additional special features of movies that I have already seen, but just wanted to watch the special features (Riley Poole's of Knowledge from Nat'l Treasure is really funny). Okay, I can't help it that I am a special features nut, or that there is nothing else to do at my house than to watch movies and s.f.

Thirdly, <a href=""http://www.vh1.com/movies/news/articles/1501522/05092005/story.jhtml?_requestid=128037"">George Lucas</a>is<b>CRAZY</b>, and I'm not talkin' walk away while smilin' and noddin' crazy. I'm talkin' full on, where's the dam strait jacket crazy. Trust me, that man would frighten me if I ever ran into him in real life, but that would mean I would have to find a life. *moment to sigh in relief that having no life has saved me from the clutches of the evil Darth Lucas* *Mwah-ha-ha-ha*

Finally, the summer job hunt is on. I alrady have one job, that doesn't start until June, which means that I need to find a job that I can start before then. So the mall, Tar-ghetto, and Movie Stores, here I come. 

Sorry about the rant...not much else to do here...
PS- Basillica line-up due out on Monday. YAY!!! Still looking for 2 ""up-and-coming Minnesota bands"" *winks @ <lj user=""fantasticmuse"">* Will keep ya posted for the summer concerty thing.

Some of you may know that I liek to waste my time by reading articles that VH1 sends me in regulatrily updated e-mails. Most of the time I learn interesting things, so it's not a total waste of time. And some things that I read, just make my head hurt. Like reading how <a href=""http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1501185/20050503/franz_ferdinand.jhtml?headlines=true&_requestid=169463""> rapper Snoop Dogg and scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand totally want to work together</a>....<B>scary!</B>"

"event","Okay people, I made it through finals week, not that you all didn't as well. But more importantly, I also made it home, with excellent timing, I should add. I didn't leave JC from until 5:30, stopped in Fargo for food and gas, and still managed to be home before 10:30...less than 5 hrs...I think that's some sort of record that needs a slight moment of admiration.

[pause for admiration]

On the way home I did manage to listen to some awesome tunes. Scissor Sisters kicked off the long way home as I realized that I hadn't listened to them in like forever. SS was followed directly by Alanis Morrissette. After hearing about her re-release of <I>Jagged Little Pill</I> I had this urge to listen to the original, which I do love. Rooney got their time in the cd player, which was followed by my band-o-bands, Matchbox 20, in honor of Rob Thomas, whose cd I have yet to purchase (stupid fan I am).

As for everything else, I am soooo tired that I think I should go pass out on my bed, I love the way that sounds... ""my bed."" ooooohh, say it again... ""my bed, my bed, my bed"" [giggles out loud to self while father in adjoining room looks confused] man, I need sleep. K people, talk to y'all later."

<strike>cross-cultural</strike>
cosmos
developmental psych
poetry
french
<b><u>Papers to write</b></u>
cross-cultural
poetry
french

And yet I cannot bring myself to work on any of the above...I distract myself with packing. I <b>hate</b> packing, last year you couldn't pay me to pack, and yet here I am, three days left and only the little stuff left around the room. Man do I wanna fget out of here real bad.

But as a side note, news from home, there is a chance that I could earn some extra cash by living in someone else's house for like 2 weeks. When I called home, my dad said that one of women at church was looking for a house sitter and that there is a chance that I could do it. SWEET. I like-a da money!!!

Okay, for reals, must do work!!!
I'm outty!"

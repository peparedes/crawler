I have more than one.

1. Chuck Palahniuk - I've loved everything that he has written, seen some of his readings on youtube, listened to the audiobooks, and it's all magical.  He makes his books come alive - you can tell that he put his soul into his writing.

2. Charles Bukowski - I just finished reading Post Office, which is quite possibly the funniest book I've ever read.  His writing style makes you feel like he's sitting right in front of you, telling part of his life story.  It would be really cool to actually have him there.

3. Chaim Potok - The Chosen is the book that <i>really</i> made me love reading.  I couldn't put it down.  I read the sequel, The Promise, in one afternoon.  

4. John Steinbeck - East of Eden is one of those books I'll never forget.  The characters in that book are completely different but completely human.  I love how he interwove his family history into the story.  His books are classic, relevant, and epic.  

5. Stephen King - I love the Dark Tower series.  I know this sounds weird, but it would be awesome to have him read these as a bedtime story.  Heh.

6. JRR Tolkien - No need to explain."

"event","January is a good time of the year for me.  It wasn't always like that, but that's a different story.  Anyway, like I said, it's a good time of year.  I just got promoted again.  60% pay increase from my last promotion at the end of November.  Along with the new promotion, I got transferred to a different theatre to be a manager there.  Today was my first day.  All the kids seem to be okay.  Odd little suckers, but whatever.  I'm just glad to be in a different place.  The last theatre just stressed me out.  There were three other managers that just sat on their asses and let me do all the work and the kids gave me nothing but attitude.  At least now I get to start over and do things how I want."

Being out of high school is great, although I am going to miss the people.  Looks like I'll be staying in Lakeland for at least a semester to go to community college (yech.) but then I'm planning on tranfering into USF.  If things go as planned, I'll figure out what I want to do in 2 years, then transfer to Baylor to finish my degree.  Maybe then get a job somewhere other than Florida.  It's weird to think that I have my whole life ahead of me.  When you've been in school for thirteen years, that's all you know, but when you finally hit the last four years of schooling, it slaps you in the face.  You'll spend most of your life working.  Some people can barely stand 13-17 years of school (some don't even stay in school that long), so how will it be spending 40+ years working?  I hope I enjoy what I do as a career."

"event","I'm sick and tired (literally).  

      I went late night bowling with Sean, Mark, Ben, Caiti, and Melissa.  Came home and ate (since it had been many, many hours since food.), and started to watch TV.  I don't know when, but I fell asleep in the upright positition, on the couch, with half a piece of leftover fish in my lap and stayled like that for 10 hours until 12:30 when I woke up.  When I woke up, I found myself with a severe headache, runny nose, aching body parts, bloodshot eyes, and almost deaf in my left ear (it's really annoying).  So I sat around all day and tried to get some sort of rest, took medicine, ate some clam chowder and peanut butter, and had tons of water.  I still feel like <i>crap</i>.  And I can't fall asleep.  And I must get up in approximately 7 hours.  I really don't know what's going on with me, but lately, I havn't been able to sleep like normal (not even my average 4-6 hours) and last night was the first night I've had a good night's sleep.  I've been sick for the past two months, thought I was just about better, and WHAM!  I'm sick again.  Every year I get sick for the entire summer and then again during the holiday season.  

      In other news.  David (my youth pastor) has been stressing me out.  Last Saturday he wanted me to drive up to the church at 10:30 so I could turn on some stupid powerpoint thing for some girl for I don't know why.  Luckily, my cell phone was dead and in the state of not-being-charged when he called.  But he had Ryan (my sister's best friend's boyfriend) call my sister and ask her if I was at home.  Luckily (again), my sister was at the beach and said ""Well, if you can't get ahold of him, go do it yourself.""  Awesome.  And I forgot to mention.  If I would have had to do the stupid little chore, I would've had about 5 minutes to get up, get ready, and get down to the place.  Ha.  But anyways.  This guy is really getting on my nerves.  It's stuff like the afformentioned that gets me mad.  He is pushy and he makes me feel obligated to do whatever he wants.  I'm not his slave.  He has another student that actually gets PAID to do what I do.  And guess how much he uses him?  Hardly. 

       I'm about to quit my at-first-voluntary-but-now-obligatory position and go to a different church.  Not only because of David, but also because of the college group.  Not to sound heathen-ish or whatever, but the people in the group can't do anything fun without bringing God into the picture, thus ruining any fun-having that was going on (if any had been going on in the first place).  My sister is also tired of these people and is thinking about moving to a different church as well.  It's sad because we both really enjoy going to church (or use to), but we can't enjoy it in full because there's a bunch of morons there who are fake, holier-than-thou people there.  It's ironic because Christianity is supposed to be accepting of everyone (and for the most part, I feel like I am accomplishing that), but the people who are self-righteous and over-zealous give other Christians a bad reputation (politicians are oh-so-notorious for this).  I just don't understand why they do it.  Well, I do, but it's still really confusing.  I've been taught that there's only black and white, no gray, and I believe that it's true.  Maybe that's why I'm so confused.  I know I'm not perfect myself, but that's what's awesome about Christianity.  We aren't perfect, we're forgiven.  

       Wow.  I didn't mean for this to be made into a preachy-post, but it's been on my mind for a loooong time and I guess it needed to get out."

"event","Costa Rica was amazing.  We left Sunday morning, went to Miami, got throught customs, etc... and took off.  The view flying in to Costa Rica was breathtaking.  We landed in San Jose which is surrounded by mountains on all sides.  Got to The Villa and ate dinner and dropped off the girls and then went to The Mission.  Monday we got up early and went to Cartago (which just kinda runs into San Jose) to go to the orphanage.  The kids there were so cool.  We taught the younger ones to play baseball and played basketball and soccer with the older ones, passed out shoes and other things they needed etc...  Two really cool guys named Sito and Caesar translated for us.  After the orphanage we went to a high school in San Jose and taught two English classes.  The second kid that I taught, Juan Pablo, was a really cool kid and we talked for a couple of hours while some of the guys played soccer against the students (we got owned).  So after the high school we went back to The Villa for lunch, then went to an elementary school to sand desks and paint classrooms.  We went across the street and got pizza and cokes (which is much better than in the U.S.) and left around 9 PM.  
     Tuesday we went Whitewater Rafting.  'Nuff said.  Wednesday we went back to the High School to teach more English classes, but we only got to teach one class because the teachers went on strike for better pay, so we went to the gym and played soccer for a couple hours and then we went out for lunch and into the city to go shopping.  I found a store that had soccer jerseys on sale for $5 so I bought three.  :P  Got hit up for money I don't know how many times.  One guy was from L.A. and had been robbed and asked for money for food, so we offered to take him to pizza hut, but Will just wanted him to go away so he gave him 3 bucks.  Saw a bum fight.  This one guy claimed to be deaf but I told him (as best I could) that I couldn't spare any money.  So eventually he left me alone.  Next thing I know, there's a scuffle between him and some bongo-playing bum.  Supposedly, the ""deaf"" bum took 1000 colones (2 dollars) from the bongo-playing bum, so the bongo-player punched the deaf bum and suddenly, the deaf bum wasn't deaf anymore!  So then, a little bit after that, I saw a guy get pick-pocketed.  Some guy just walked right up to another guy, took his bag and walked off.  I guess some people were telling the guy what had happened and he ran after the guy, but he got away.  
     Thursday we went to the Rainforest to go on some zipline tour of the forest which was very fun.  After that we went to the Hot Springs of the nearby Volcano (which was a waste of time...) and then had dinner there.  On the was there we saw a flipped semi truck and we got a flat tire.  On the way back we saw a dead guy laying on the side of the road who, apparently, had been shot.  So that was creepy.  Then the second bus got pulled over for no reason at all, making our total time driving back about 4.5 hours.  Got back around midnight and packed, woke up at 5:15 and got ready in about 5 minutes since the bus was already loading up.  Got to the airport and went through to the ticket counter (which took forever since there was 60 of us).  The plane didn't start loading until 9:15 which was way late, since we were to take off at 9:18.  We got on the plane and waited for takeoff.  I fell asleep, expecting to be woken up when we were taking off, but I woke up to the captain on the intercom.  We hadn't moved an inch and it was 10:15.  The captain informed us that the plane was too heavy, so they needed to change planes, so we all got off and went to a new gate, loaded up buses 30 minutes later, and boarded the new plane.  We didn't take off until 11:15  >_>;  So we flew into Miami and went through customs (which took forever) got through at about 4:30.  The bus didn't get to the airport until 5:30 or so and then we went on our final stage of the trip...the 4 hour ride home.  So we stopped for dinner and got back about 10:15.  Came home, talked to my parents about the trip and now I'm here."

Your views are most similar to those of Christianity. Do more research on Christianity and possibly consider being baptized and accepting Jesus, if you aren't already Christian.

Christianity is the second of the Abrahamic faiths; it follows Judaism and is followed by Islam. It differs in its belief of Jesus, as not a prophet nor historical figure, but as God in human form. The Holy Trinity is the concept that God takes three forms: the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Ghost (sometimes called Holy Spirit). Jesus taught the idea of instead of seeking revenge, one should love his or her neighbors and enemies. Christians believe that Jesus died on the cross to save humankind and forgive people's sins.<br><br><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Christianity</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='88' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>88%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Judaism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='42' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>42%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Islam</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='33' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>33%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Buddhism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='17' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>17%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Hinduism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='17' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>17%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Satanism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='4' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>4%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>agnosticism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='0' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>0%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Paganism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='0' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>0%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>atheism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='0' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>0%</font></td></tr></td></tr></table><br><a href='http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=10907'>Which religion is the right one for you?

Then I went with Michael, Sean, and Steve-o to the Davis house to get some stuff to go to the batting cages.  Then after the batting cages, went to Sonic and got a Strawberry Limeade.  Then went to EB.  Then back to school where there was a little league game.  Met Drew there, watched about 2 minutes of the game, then batting cages again.  Drew, Michael and I came back to my house, I got some extra clothes, and then went to Will's house to pick him up.  Went to Drew's, ate, started a fire. Stood around the fire for...4 hours.  Slept in the tent.  Woke up 3 hours later, went to Drew's church, went to Twistee Treat, then back to Drew's house.  Hung out for a long time.  Went back to Drew's church to play some Dodgeball, then to my house to get another change of clothes.  Picked up Steve-o and Andrew, went to Drew's house with Drew, Will, Steve-o, Andrew, and Josh.  Ate some swiss steak and mashed taters.  Then started another fire.  Andrew and Steve-o went to sleep in the tent, Will, Drew and I took some M-90's and then proceeded to terrorize the neighborhood down the street.  Got back around 12:30.  Had a late night snack.  Sat out by the fire until 2.  Went to sleep in the tent again.  Woke up, hung around and lit firecrackers until 10:30, then came home, took a nice nap, scanned pictures for our senior video, and now I'm here.  :D"

I got The Killers' CD, I had the best lunch ever, today was a good day for wallball, the weather was poifect, and all that other junk that makes a day awesome.  

Well.  There was Pre-Cal.  That kinda sucked at first because I had left my book in that Mr. Livesay's room the day before.  Not good.  See I was supposed to have a book cover on it that day, so I grabbed one of those stretchy cover things and put it on there for just that day, but we're not allowed to put them on our books b/c they break the bindings, etc...  Anywho, I left without it and he got ahold of it and then today, I go in and see my book on his desk.  He told me I would have to pay for the stupid book because apparently, <i>I</i> broke the binding because of the stupid book cover.  I told him that the stupid book's binding couldn't break in one day and that it was like that when I got it, but then he looked at the book condition that I wrote in the front.  I wrote good.  Well I distinctly remember when I got the book telling him that the binding was broken, but he didn't listen.  So then we got into an argument about the stupid book and now I'm gonna have to pay 60 dollars for the most evil and vile book in the world.  But then we ate cheesecake that Lindsay made for Eric day, so that made up for it.  

Then I came home and took a nice long nap.  And I had a good dinner.  And now I'm happy and not tired, and I get a nice 4 day weekend.  Tomorrow is the annual Work-A-Thon thing at school.  I'm a painting crew, then I'll go over to Will's and go swimming, then off to my house, or maybe the movies.  Monday is a teacher workday.  Tuesday I get to miss school because we are shooting our short film.  And then in about two months, I will be in Costa Rica, hopefully (If my passport comes in time.  looooooong story.)  And then I graduate.  And then I must get a summer job.  And then college.  Trying to decide if I commute all the way to Tampa, or if I live on campus.  It's leaning heavily towards the latter, but my mom sounded surprised when I told her I was considering living on campus.  Oh well."

I have to sort, scan, crop, sort more, compile, and edit about 9087367530925 pictures for our senior video that is due in two weeks so there will be enough time to make the DVD's.  I have scanned 23 out of 57 people all by myself, which took an insane amount of time.  But even when I get the pictures done, I have to schedule interviews with seniors, edit video from things such as Kindergarten graduations, homecomings, plays, musicals, and whole buttload of stuff.  So the total amount of work equals 2 buttloads and 1 cheekload (That's two and a half weeks of work, squeezed into two weeks, for those who don't know).

I hope everyone else is doing much better than I (not that I'm doing <i>bad</i>, just stressed out.)

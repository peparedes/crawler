Anyways, nothing really exciting has happened....yet.  Surrounded by a couple new friends, from which i am learning a lot of and love to hang out with.  Life has been nice to me so far, and i continue on the road to success.  

Who knew that the one thing i didnt wanna do in the first place, would be what i would be doing...and am enjoying:-P  Being a nurse is pretty cool, i mean ive worked in the medical field a lot and well im learning more, and right now im trying to get my degree as a registered nurse, and then move to boston, where i will receive my bach. in nursing and get into becoming an O.R. Nurse.  Things are going pretty smoothly and i'm crossing my fingers that things will continue to go the same.  

On another subject, I'd like to say that i really miss my old friends from OHS.  i havent seen anyone from Orange for quiet a while and am wondering how and what theyre up to.  Hopefully safe, and in good health with their lives going according to planned :-)  Ever since i rid myself of aol, i havent seen much of anyone lately.  Jaime i hope youre doing well, and that your dreams are coming true for you.  remember not to let anyone put you down :-) Hope all of your relationships are doing well and i hope to see you soon so we can hang out and you can tell me what youve been up to :-)  

Luis i havent seen you in a while and hope the best for you and your gf :-) I also hope your dreams are coming true and maybe ill stop by your work or house for a quick hello :-) Take care.

I've emailed everyone else whom does not visit or have livejournal, take care ya'll :-P"

"event","In my life i have had friendships that felt like they would last a life time, and i have had friendships in which the trust and bond between two good friends was broken.  And im aware that in my life, i may continue to have a little of each world.  Sometimes though, its unexpected.  friends in which you rely on can easily turn on your back and it can sometimes sting pretty bad.  As is the case with Selina.  

I write this in my journal because i want to share this with friends and would like to express my feelings over this whole subject. Also, to get a few things cleared up, which i think is most important, and hopefully those reading this will respect me and my thoughts for it.  

The way things began, at least in my perspective, is when in high school, im unsure of whether it was my junior yr or senior yr, i commented to Selina (Quintana.. as you guys should know) about Stephanie Pounder.  Im not sure where we were going but i knew that stephanie was invited...i made somewhat of a cringe and selina asked me why the cringe.  I told her that i didnt know steph very well, but from what it seemed like, she was always mad or at least seemed like it, or frusterated. As all of you know, when going out with friends and someone is a little down or mad or whatever, it kinda kills the moment.  At least for me it does, because if i know someone isnt enjoying themselves its kind of a downer.  I told selina how i cant really say much because i dont know her as well as her or jaime did, but that it always seemed like she was in a bad mood, which  made it no fun.  

Years pass by, and while in college i took a photo class, and stephanie happened to be in it.  I actually thought it was nice because i hadnt seen people from high school much other than close friends, and it was nice to see someone familiar.  Getting to know stephanie a lot better, i commented to selina on how she isnt what i thought she was and isnt at all moody or whatever.  But on the other hand, shes nice and was fun to talk with and work with while in photo class.  I'm not sure when or how what i had said years ago came up between selina and steph, but it seems that selina changed my words, saying that i disliked, hated, or was annoyed by steph.  Either way, stephanie took this info and ran with it.  Later, she reacted with disgust towards me and didnt seem to even want me in the same room, and i of course did not understand why.  After asking selina, already having a suspicion that she might have said something, and she confirmed that she mentioned ""something"" about it.  Selina told me that stephanie was asking about whether ppl liked her and studff like that, and selina happned to mention what i thought.  Whether that is true or false, im not sure.   

Later on, speaking to Jaime, he imed a message stating that he heard i didnt like stephanie.  After talking to him about it, i found out that Stephanie herself had ran with the info Selina gave and complained about it to jaime.  Ever since then, their has been hostility between me and stephanie.  
Hostility that sometimes caused Selina some pain in the butt. Selina sometimes having to lie either to me or stephanie about things.  When i would hang out with selina, she would lie to stephanie about her where abouts and stuff like that, which is really Selinas decision and her own personal stuff.  

I decided that i wasnt going to let any of this bother  me, and let it go.  Yet over time, i have found it irrritating because it was a problem that was never resolved. 

Another thing that bothered me was the fact that this ""selina"" has seemed to turn her back on me, at least thats the way i feel.  Selina was starting to ignore me, not return calls and eventually disappeared from my life until a few days ago, when i called her to say hello.  I dont know about you, but when your close friends with someone, you dont just disappear for no reason and not state way.  When i can, i email, im, or call friends at least to say hi for a few secs, and if i dont stay long its because i have a hectic schedule.  So when selina stopped calling or anything, i took it to the heart because we had hung out for so long and she was my friend in which i confided in.   I would have understood if she was sick, or something like that, but by the look of things it just seems that she stopped caring and is hanging out with stephanie a lot more.  Whether steph has somehow had an influence on this i dont know. 

What i do know is that, im trying to rid myself of people who really are no good and trying to clear things up as well.  I ask an apology to Jiame, Mike and other friends whom i have spoken to and have told me over and over again that a friend such as selina is a waste of time and effort.  Also, id like to say that i have never said anything about disliking stephanie or anything before, and whatever selina has said is a lie.  But, learning how things are, id like to say that Stephanie too, is a waste of time.  

NOW, i do not like her at all, and have found that she, just as selina, creates drama in her life because she has nothing else better to do with her time.  

If stephanie ever had a chance to read this, id like to say this to her:
Whatever Selina has told you about me not liking you, is a lie.  Yet your reaction to the things she has said make me realize that you are truly a waste of time.  In photo class, i was always nice to you, respectful, and i always tried to help you out when you needed the help.  Never did i treat you or act in a way that could hint that i disliked you or hated you.  In fact, i grew to like you.  And it amazes me how fast you have forgotten that, just because Selina poisoned my words and changed them into things i never said about you.  I dont like you now, nor will i ever, and the reason for that is because of the way you handled this whole situation.  You ran with the info she gave you and whined about it to ppl.  Never once asking yourself if it could be true, or even confronting me about it.  Youre a coward and thats all i have to say to you.  

To Selina:
I'd like to tell you that i really thought you and i were good friends, but your actions over this whole time has proven otherwise.  You lied about me, and lied to my face when i confronted you about the whole situation with stephanie.  You did not even try to clear things up, in fact it seemed that you were rather pleased with her and i not liking each other.  Jaime was right when he told me that a friend like you, was a waste of my time and that you truly were not my friend.  You love drama in your life, and by the looks of it so does steph and i am so over high school and am moving on with my life, so my advice to you is to GROW UP. 

Thats all i have to say for right now, and please feel free to comment on any of this.  Thanks."

I just have to wash it and have it cleaned, im such a messy girl but oh well. </P>
<P>I read an article today about some parents, in florida (the crazy state :-P) that went on strike.&nbsp; They moved out of their house and live on the front porch. Why? because theyre fed up with their children not doing their chores.&nbsp; So, theyre on strike.&nbsp; Dishes have piled up, clothes unwashed, no cooking - jsut tv dinners.&nbsp; I say good for them, the kids are 17, and 13 and still refuse to do them.&nbsp; I thought that was pretty funny....</P>
<P>There ar so many things ive put off, just procrastinating about any sort of thing i have to do and i really should start to finish them off.&nbsp; Presents to finish wrapping, cards to send, all that stuff.&nbsp; Finals to study for, my room to clean, clothes to wash, ughhhhh.&nbsp; I just hide in my bed and hope for it to al go away.&nbsp; Ive never been so lazy before...i dunno how i got this way but im feeling more and more of a failure.....im crazy :(&nbsp; I'll go clean my room when i get home, ill prob feel better when my room isnt so cluttered.&nbsp; Maybe ill post a pic of what my room looks like now....and Jaime...now it really is BAD...not like the time u teased about :-P </P>"

I woke up early this morning to drop off my brother at school and then headed for my human sex. class at 9:30.  I had the unfortunate luck of having these two (very annoying) girls siting next to me.  GRRR they would not shut up during the lecture but whatever...they know i dont like them so ha :-Plol anyways....one of the girls carried a faux Dooney and bourke bag....which i happen to have, it was funny she was trying to hide her bag when she saw mine was real but whatever. Anything to spite them makes my day :-P.....so after that i went to home depot and bought a remote control for the garage door cuz mines a lil cracked and wacked...theenn......i came home...cooked some lunch for my dad and brother...and am now here.  So not much of a day but ...all if well so i guess thats good.  I'm a lil hungry though hmm....i could go for a sanwich. 
Anywho....take care k :-)

Oh yea...on the way from school there was a huge line of cars waiting for some cars to pass by.  they were escorted by the police and i was interested who it might be....Unfortunately, when i glanced over to see what was going on..it was to the cemetery and from the looks of it... for a soldier.  made me sad the whole time back.  Everyday i hear a lot of noise on the news about whats going on in Iraq and here im passing by the funeral of someone who was actually there and didnt make it.  Makes me hate bush even more....bastard.  So many ppl already....."

I can't wait to live on my own someday...i want to move out of my home really bad...only to have a place of my own where i can stay all day and not worry about anyone nagging at me lol...anywho...the love scene in my life seems to be going ok...it has its ups and downs..i'll admit but it always seems to work out...i think thats the number one sign that shows thigns just might work out....when you can get over small fights and stuff....and still enjoy each others company...i think thats cool...well....good luck to everyone out there...dont rush :-) just have fun"

But that does not make you a bad<br>person. Some of my friends are apathetic and I<br>love them, but it wouldn't hurt to care a<br>little more. Trust me life hurts, most people<br>who are apathetic do it cause they were hurt.<br>But don't worry, life is pain, its also<br>pleasure. Good luck. (please vote)

"event","Ok now....close your eyes and think of the one place you would love to be at this very very very moment.  It's crucial that all your senses be involved in this so think of a smell that might be there (perfume? trees? all that), think of the things you would see, feel, hear, and taste.  Take a deep breath and tell yourself that no matter what happens in life, you can always get back up. You'll be stronger and better and wiser :) So whatever negative vibes people are giving you, are mess youre in or obstacle that you are trying to ovrecome, don't worry. Because if you fail, there's always tomorrow and another chance to try again.  :)"

"event","I'm not sure how i feel right now...
I am contemplating everything in life, like most people my age do every single day, and i dont feel sad and i dont feel happy.  I feel alright, and i guess as long as im feeling alright, everything is alright.  But its not, cuz at the same time, stuff sucks ass.  
Anywho.... i went to class today and we watched a movie about discrimination.  It was actually pretty cool cuz there was a teacher who taught a third grade class, and she wanted them to feel first hand, what it was like to have someone discriminate against you.  Maybe you guys have heard about it?  Its called ""A Class Divided"" and its pretty darn cool.  The day after Martin Luther King Jr. was assasinated, this teacher thought that it was time someone teach kids that discrimination is a bad thing to do, and she didnt want them to just hear her talk, but to have them experience it themselves and see what others feel.  So she divided her class into two groups, people with blue eyes and people with brown eyes.  She told the browned kids that those with blue eyes were better than those with brown eyes, therefore they get better treatment.  The blue eyed kids were allowed 5 minutes more for recess and a whole bunch of other stuff.  Eventually, the brown eyed kids came to feel resentment towards those with blue eyes, and those with blue eyes felt more powerful.  The class that was once joyful and playful with one another, now came to somewhat hate those who werent seen at their level.  A fight even arose because one boy called another boy ""brown eyed"".  Then the next day the teacher said that she had made a mistake and those with brown eyes are actually superior to those with blue eyes, and so things turned around and now those with blue eyes were treated like crap i guess, and they felt resentment just like those who did the day before.  In the end, the kids learned to understand that disciminating is no fun, and all were friends once again.  The kids said they hated the feeling of being an outcast and didnt like it.  The teacher told them if they would ever discriminate another person and they said no because it didnt feel good.  14 yrs later they had a reunion and they all said how much it affected their lives and so on....it was pretty cool...wish our teachers would do that today.  Anywho...thats all :)  I talk too much....."

Psychology is so hard.  I do enjoy going to psych class but i have to admit that it stresses me out.  So many things to learn and understand, not that i dont enjoy it, its just so overwhelming. 
I have ignored my art class for about two whole weeks now.  Not on purpose i may add, its just that i've been so busy with everything else that i completely forgot. I checked my syllabus today and it turns out an exam was due yesterday and i freaked out but teacher emailed us a while back (forgot about the email too) and shes giving us til next week. Big sigh of relief....now i can study more and not worry so much.   
I miss bio class from time to time...and yes im ashamed but at the same time....i really dont give a hoot.  It's beyond boring, its more like torture.  I used to enjoy bio class but this teacher is beyond boring...well...actually hes pretty cool but the topic is beyond boring.  Hate chemistry.  But im forcing myself to go...
Im slacking is math but im doing best to get a move on....finish up all the hw i have.  I hope i do well on this weeks test...wish me luck?
Sociology is a breeze.  People freaked because she didnt hand out a study guide, she said we had to be independent and so a lot of ppl freaked....i didnt. From what i observed of her and her lectures..shes flat out lazy.  She could do a whole lot more on those powerpints, but she doesnt....so i pretty much pictured what her tests would be like.  lol of course im an idiot and completely forgot to review for the test...so 10 min before class i crammed in as much as i could....i got a C(2 points away from a B) so i guess i had her pretty much summed up.  She's cool and everything but from watching her...she didnt look like the type that could spend hours working on a lecture...unlike my psych teacher.  So this time im doing some more studying and hoping to get an A, if not a B.  
Then theres Bio Lab but its alright so far.  
Things here at home are going ok.  Aunt and Grandma are back again and so theyre chilling at our house during the day. Brother seems to be doing a little better with school, which im happy about.  Friends.....its sad.  I wish i could say that everything was great and dandy but theyre not.  I do miss things....but like someone said....its prob for the best.  
I'm perming my hair (finally! i know...i know...ive told ppl that a couple months ago and never did it) I'm not doing tight curls though! so dont picture me as shirley temple :-P 
It wont even be curls...more like loose waves...so we'll see how that goes.  Music sucks....not all of it but i've found that i get bored easily.  Music has lost its meaning to me in a way.  Im hungering for some talent.  Also, im going to start some art project...not sure what yet. I use to draw and color and do something artistic from time to time but ive stopped.  So im going to take up drawing again? Keep a sketch pad with me and doodle when im feeling bored, sad, or even happy :) 
I might even start to write in this journal more....perhaps more thoughts, rather than what i did today or yesterday.  That can get boring i guess...
You know...when i gave blood that one day...i noticed that i started to bruise up a lil where she poked the needle....but..that went away and now i have a big bruise on my arm but no where near the area where she poked me and another small bruise even farther away...maybe i should see a doc?...weird...."

"event","I skipped Psych today....but...its was for a good cause :) I donated blood.  It was my first time, and i expected to have the feeling of...HAVING THE LIFE SUCKED OUT OF ME, but didnt.  I just lay there, patiently.  What sucked was when the lady messed up and didnt put the needle in my vein so she had to do it over.  IT HURT! Freaking lady jabbed my arm with a needle and didnt even get it right :-P lol but anyways...she was nice...just messed up so whatever. Arm is still sore though....
They kept asking me....do you feel woosy? dizzy? are you ok? and i was like....umm...im just fine. I felt no different. I didn't feel like a lost any blood but whatever.  
There was also some sale going on at our school. Like, they were selling books and cd's and all the money would go to charity...so i bought a book, and 3 cd's.  I bought the Invincible cd from jackson and some deep house thing...i like them. The other one i bought is rap....which i thought was a trance cd but whatever.  
Went home after that and then drove granms to the store for something...she just wanted to get a few things for the trip she's going on tomorrow .....and so thats it. 

Rain, rain...dont go away...."

"event","Well everything went just as it always does.....class and everything.  When i got out of class though, it was a different story. There was a group of students at the outdoor theatre and they were talking about Malcom X.  I guess you could say preaching in a way.  At first i found it annoying, but as i continued to listen....i kinda liked their message.  They were spreading their Islamic beliefs and all. He kept talking about oppression and how the ""white man"" did this and did that.  I found it to be sorta annoying because some of the things he said...just didnt fit with what i thought, but i did agree on some things.  There's going to be another show going on at UCI tomorrow...wish i could attend but...class :-P 
was funny how he said, ""Violence is as American as apple pie."""

Bat your eyes girl
Be otherworldly
Count your blessings
Seduce a stranger
What's so wrong with being happy
Kudos to those who see through sickness

When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
Don't ever let life pass you by

I suggest we learn to love ourselves before it's made illegal
When will we learn?
When will we change?
Just in time to see it all fall down

Those left standing will make millions 
Writing books on the way it should have been

We are like frogs oblivious
To the water
Starting to boil
No one flinches
We all float face down

Same as usual ya know? I left home to go to class then just listened to the prof...the lecture and all.  Came home and did some things...then got ready for my other class...headed to Mainplace for a while and then got on the freeway home. 
Nothing new has happened and its making me uneasy.  I need something to happen...u kno..out of the ordinary...likeeee....green martians invading my backyard or finding diamonds growing out of my moms flowers.  THAT would be nice.  Diamonds are a girls best friend...and its a lil sad.  Everytime i see one its like..ooohh! shiny! ya know?  Turning into a yahoo....if u dont know what im takling about watch the movie gullivers travels.....its interesting....and its suppose to reflect politics and make a mockery of some systems....but the movie is good.  Anywho...these yahoos...unciviled men and women...were attracted to all this shiny stuff...which turned out to be diamonds.  
So anywho...diamonds are nice...and white gold and platinum ..even silver...not a fan of the yellow gold.  so if ever you happen to pass by a jewlery store and think...""hmm...i'll get paula a nice ring/bracelet/necklace"" remember..white gold or platinum or silver and diamonds:) NO YELLOW GOLD....:-P lol yea i do realize thats never gonna happen :) 
As always...take care:) i mean that...dont go do a pole and then find out u have the chicken pox because you were red :)
chao....  <--- jaime taught me how to spell that correctly ;) thanx! at least i think its correct.....hmmm..."

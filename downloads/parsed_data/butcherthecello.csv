"event","I wish sometimes that I could take all the power in the world and make myself implode. 
School is driving me mad. 
Work is driving me super mad. Well one employee in particular. But there will soon be a remedy for that one. That don't get that I am the only fucking income in my home. I should probably drop out of school. But that would be ridiculous would it not? I only have three more classes after this semester. I just really feel that for the most part I am really alone and in the long run do people really care about the things they take responsibility for? Is this something that I should simply chalk up to youth and bad manners? 
Last week I had an actor go out and party before a PERFORMANCE in front of my mentor and his class of 120 freshman intro to theatre students. Came in (an hour late to call) - told me that they were drunk and still coked up from the night before. Tonight - I have an actor who is hanging out with the new clique of theatre students and they are sick and called to tell me that they would not be at the last rehearsal before we leave for a COMPETITION? I understand. I am trying to understand. But I am feeling played and I am angry and I am quite upset. 

Is there really no support out there? Is this why theatre is a joke and the people who make up the theatre world are seen as lazy pompous asses? I am so fed up. Why do I even try anymore? Why do I even care anymore? 

Is this all there is for christ sake? 

I can only put out there in the universe that I hope that this isn't the way it is everywhere. That this isn't my lot. That if I work hard it will pay off. But when will my back stop breaking? And when will I stop handing the world over to people who don't care?

There is a small horrid part of me that hopes that there is something wrong with me - and that I will be put out my misery soon. It sits on my shoulder and tells me that I suck and I deserve to rot. And sometimes I really believe that voice. 

Someone in my department told me that I they didn't even know why I was trying to do this thing because I wasn't going to win the Kennedy Center thing or get any recognition. I am beginning to believe it. I don't want to  - I don't want to give into this negativity. 

I'm just tired. And this is the stuff that makes my body all that much more sick."

"event","Let the good times roll I say. I'm in a bit of a weird place. When am I not? I am looking forward to this move outta this abode. I am REALLY looking forward to this move. I want out. I want out of this environment that makes my head hurt. I want to be in a place where I can be creative without thinking that my neighbors across the street are in the process of stealing my car, stealing my friends car, accosting anyone I know or myself with a gun. I'm afraid that if we are not out before Christmas something bad may happen. I don't know what - but it is in my gut. Is it a premonition or is it me being hysterical? Dunno. I'm still figuring that one out. 
I got into the Kennedy Center - I'm scared that I'm not good enough for that one. I'm excited that they chose me. I'm scared that my cast will not want to help pay to schlep ourselves down to Florida. Scared, Scared, Scared. But in a good way. 
It makes me feel giddy in a way. Perhaps this is the break from normality I was looking for, something to say that yes, this is what frames my life as what it is I do. What is it that I do? Too much. I am gathering the strength to do the things that I need to do in order to push forward. 
28 years old and I finally figured out REALLY want it is I want when I grow up. It is still theatre as a profession. But being a director doesn't define me as a person does it? I think I am someone who directs because I love it . . . I guess we all define ourselves by what it is we do rather than by who we are. 
<shrug>
I'll figure it out. 
And I can't hope that it will be anything other than good."

This stuff is fucking fantastic. I love propaganda . . . I love it even more when they dredge up stuff that you forgot you saw in the media . . . like Rumsfeld and Hussein shaking hands, like the chemical weapons we gave Iraq . . . we gave them whatever weapons of mass destruction they have. Regardless of what you believe - we created, fabricated this war for ourselves. We gave them the tools to destroy each other and us. 

In other news - I am finally getting a car. I get it on Thursday. So my link to mobile freedom will be a reality again. I in all reality love taking mass transit . . . I hated some of the people that make it a scary ride. Last week was the last straw . . . I boarded the bus and immediately started getting harassed by two large men. They kept on until we got to the train station and then preceded to continue on the train platform. I boarded the train and they immediately crammed me in between them - continuing their shit talk. The only thing I could do was to ignore them. I did so and they continued to get abusive. They followed me through the five points station until I disappeared through a few trains into a crowd and found a cop. This was at 10 am on a weekday! Jackasses. Its people like that who give taking mass transit a bad name. I shouldn't have to walk around scared. I should not have to feel like a victim. So I get a car. I'm adding to the flagrant abuse of Atlanta air quality until I get the biodiesel system in place. Go to: www.vegenergy.com for more info on how to make your car better for the smog issue and also better for the issue of keeping our fuel intake a domestic affair. I have never been overtly political until this election. I have been a passive voice. Not that my eyes were closed - more so I think that the apathy of my generation has taken its toll on my world outlook. I think I am awake now and trying to do some good with that. 
Get out and vote.Dammit!

All for now . . . go man, go."

"event","So today was a walking day. After dealing with Financial Aid and all its crap I had to get out of the house and take myself on a date. East Atlanta is a 5-dollar-with-tip-kind-of-car-ride. So on the way there I took a cab. For the first time in all of my cab taking days (since February) this guy wouldn't talk to me at all. Usually I get this wierdo who asks me about my nefarious pot smoking habit and/or if jesus christo my saviour has come down from the heavens and saved me as of late. This guy was as silent as waiting for someone to pick up the phone after they have left you on hold for 20 minutes. So I got down there (5 bucks later) . . .finished up some business for the theatre and took myself out on a Thai food date. Which I thouroughly needed and enjoyed. 
Then proceeded to walk around East Atlanta. I went into shops and looked around, ran into an old friend and walked down to see her house . . . then I walked home. I forget sometimes how beautiful Atlanta is . . . the hydrangas and daylilies are in bloom and the smell of freshly cut grass makes the overwhelming smog problem not as overwhelming. I could actually breathe a little easier. I stopped in at a ma and pop auto store and found a possibility for a car purchase. (I probably will not buy until after February the month of stolen cars on my street)~ I got invited by this man to see his flea market which was attached to the car lot and looked at his assorted pocket radios and ten dollar dresses which he seemed to think would look great on me whilst tripping on the assorted toy abacus (spelling and boy has it been a while since I have seen one of those) and car batteries. I left there to walk home slowly taking my time hitting tree branches away from my face. All in all a good day. A day to ponder? Dunno. I should take myself on more walks and dates. It feels good. Even faced with the lack of money . . .it feels good. It reminds me of the times mom and I would walk the year she was pregnant with Ashlee. It reminds me of the mint chocolate chip ice cream cones and the days on my swingset as a child. It reminds me that my stresses are me being too hard on myself and I should just be. 
I am worried about the show. 
I am worried about the band. 
I am worried about my own sanity.
I am worried about my love life. 
I am worried about my safety. 
I am worried about so many things that I just need to let go of. 
Eventually - I think those things, those worries will die down and that I can find my own Zen time. I just need to learn to be quiet with myself and tell those damned voices to shut up. Perhaps I should walk more often and let those go of those things. Perhaps I should invent new ways to spend time alone. Tis good, yeah?"

I have so much more work to do and all I can do is pound out my frustration on this computer keyboard."

"event","Music lyrics seem to pull a little too hard sometimes . . .
I feel way overwhelmed and hope that someone can scoop me up and carry me off. It is as if all of my plans were taken away at some point and left in car that had its windows up on a hot summer day - get the point? I can't have an expectation for someone to do things for me - I never have. Well I can't say never. I just wish that people would act on their own volition and not wait. I want to curl up and sleep for a bit. But as usual I find that has escaped me as well. I'm worried that not all will be okay. That as often as I tell myself it is okay- its not. But I know it has to be. 
Praying to God seems to be in order and the words as well escape my mind. 



Metal heart

Losing the star without a sky
Losing the reasons why
You're losing the calling that you've been faking
And i'm not kidding

It's damned if you don't and it's damned if you do
Be true 'cause they'll lock you up in a sad sad zoo
Oh hidy hidy hidy what cha tryin to prove
By hidy hidy hiding you're not worth a thing

Sew your fortunes on a string
And hold them up to light
Blue smoke will take
A very violent flight
And you will be changed
Sand everything
And you will be in a very sad sad zoo.

I once was lost but now i'm found was blind
But now I see you
How selfish of you to believe in the meaning of all the bad dreaming

Metal heart you're not hiding
Metal heart you're not worth a thing

Metal heart you're not hiding
Metal heart you're not worth a thing"

"event","Okay and again. Why? What? When? Where? and How? What the Fuck? Is life supposed to be a royal pain in the ass? Because if it is I am getting double the fun and pleasure of being ass raped every time I think about succeeding. Over it. And Tired. Sometimes I wish that I could disappear. Walk somewhere. Curl up in a ball and sleep for a few years. Have I always been this tense? I guess so... but it is getting worse and I am afraid that I will loose my best friend and lover in the process. What do I do? What in the world do I do? I'm praying. And hoping for a miracle. God - help me."

"event","Cigarette good. 
Man - if I wake up one more morning feeling this incredible sense of...
I don't know what it is. I have all this crap roving through my head though. 
And as usual I don't want to go to work. I just want to stay home all the time. That is it. Stay home. I don't want to do anything else. I don't want to be anywhere else. I just want to be home. 
I am looking forward to the possibility of dissappearing. But at the same time I want so much to succeed. 
Success. That seems to be just some nefarious wierd thing hovering over me. It is in my grasp. So very very close. I have my music. I have my acting. I am good - damn good at both of these things. I just want them to pay me. I want to not live hand to mouth. I want to live the way I could and should be living. I want Michael's artwork to succeed. I want our music to succeed. I want to be living. Right now - I feel like I am trudging through something. I am doing so much. Can't i be doing more? 
I should be doing more. But I am not. I am not. I am not. 
Jesus. What is wrong with me? I have my wish. I wished for the man of my life I have right now. I have a home. I have a job. I am in school. 
Buckle down. 
Things can be good. 
Things are good. 
What am I afraid of? 
What - what is it?
Am I afraid of success? I think I am. 
How do I get over it? 
DO I get over it?
Ack!
I will. 
I will?
I will.
I will myself to succeed. 
I will myself to get out there and do it. 
I will myself to jump off the precipice without looking for a safety net."

"event","Your Present Hexagram
This hexagram gives you reflection on the situation or relationship as it was at the time you cast your coins.

33 ""Retreat""

All worthy goals meet resistance of some kind. When negative forces predominate, a well-timed retreat is necessary in order to stay on the path to success. Tibetans know this.

Strategic retreat is not to be confused with escape or surrender. Successful retreat demands quick and nimble movement - taking up a new position before you are damaged severely by the current situation. You are not admitting defeat by such action, but simply increasing your options, and preserving your resources. Sometimes it is necessary to slow down, let go or move back temporarily in order to develop countermoves for the future. Timing is critical, as is positioning after realignment. Considerations of personal security are critical.

Periods of withdrawal or retreat call for cool-headedness. It is necessary to keep your wits about you. Attend to small details while allowing yourself time to contemplate the whole picture. Be creative; not all progress follows a straight line. Self-confidence is also essential; small setbacks can easily become defeats if we allow ourselves to become mired in self-doubt or self-pity.

Waves of progress are, by their nature, short-lived. Learn to attune yourself to the up-and-down cycles of life. When the wave is behind you, ride it in; when it's not, lie low. Don't fool yourself into thinking that you can ""fix"" any situation whenever you feel like it. Some things are bigger than you are. Hold your pride in check and you will be better prepared to find creative openings."

"event","Time. It seems to escape me every so often. I feel a bit strange as if I should be doing more but I am not. As if I should do less but I don't. It is almost as if I blacked out today and lost all track of everything that I need to do. Spring Break has been my bodies excuse to break down and get sick no wonder with everything that I do. So it is nice to do nothing - unfortunately it is an agging sense that I need to do more.
I will do what I do. 
I deserve to do what I do.
And I don't need permission from anyone any longer to do what I do. 
Damnit. 
I feel like I am the trapped 12 year old in my mothers house with the reign of words like worthless in my vocabulary as to how I feel about myself. 
I don't know why I look for approval outside of myself so very often. 
It drives me absolutely crazy. 
But It is a lesson I need to learn. I suppose if I stay conscience of it - then I can tackle it. It is simply the task of keeping a grip on those things long enough to continue on whatever it is I am supposed to be doing. 
I forget what my Personal Legend is from time to time. 
I think it is to perform and do the things that I set out to do when I was four. 
I am not quite sure. 
15 minutes are up though and I need to do my daily ritual of nothing this week.
Signing off until later."

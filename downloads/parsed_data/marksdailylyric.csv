Its full of rippin drums, tight music and meters, and awesome lyrics with a meaning.  Such as:

System of a Down
DDevil
System of a Down

Stupid people do stupid things,
Smart people outsmart each other,
Then themselves, then themselves,
Then themselves, then themselves.

Its so true.  Unfortunately, I fall into both categories.  I think trying to avoid staying in either mindset is a good idea.  So wise.

Then again, lyrics in this song also include:

Shake your spear at Shakespeare, Shake your spear at Shakespeare.

and thats just freakin funny."

You go get shot up with more and more needles 
And you tell me that you're drug free 
Drug Free 

Mista mista 
I haven't ate anything for a week 
Can I get a quarter? 

HELL NO MOTHERFUCKA 
What can a quarter get you?

You are just fucked up 
Off them fucked up drugs 
You know you need to leave alone 
But you keep telling me that you're drug free 
MOTHERFUCKA 
You ain't drug free, you're a fiend 

And everytime I try to help you 
You pretend as if it's okay 
Then later on in the week 
You go back to shootin' needles, to sniffin' 
Oh mf, but you told me you were DRUG FREE 
DRUG FREE 
You ain't drug free motherfucka 
So you damn well, can't get no motherfuckin money from me"

"event","So today I did something rare.  I listened to the radio a lot in my car.  I heard ""Walking on the Sun"" (I forget the real name of the song) by Smashmouth, then ""Machinehead"" by Bush, and next ""Pepper"" by The Butthole Surfers.

I was feeling great and high on the incredible sounds of the '90s, and was rarin to make a post about a '90s song.  However, the next song beat the '90s by a landslide and it therefore, wins today's lyrical writing.

Peter Gabriel
Shock The Monkey
Security


Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey to life

Cover me when I run
Cover me through the fire
Something knocked me out' the trees
Now I'm on my knees
Cover me, darling please
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know when you're going to shock the monkey

Fox the fox
Rat the rat
You can ape the ape
I know about that
There is one thing you must be sure of
I can't take any more
Darling, don't you monkey with the monkey
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey

Wheels keep turning
Something's burning
Don't like it but I guess I'm learning

Shock! - watch the monkey get hurt, monkey

Cover me, when I sleep
Cover me, when I breathe
You throw your pearls before the swine
Make the monkey blind
Cover me, darling please
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey

Too much at stake
Ground beneath me shake
And the news is breaking

Shock! - watch the monkey get hurt, monkey

Shock the monkey
Shock the monkey
Shock the monkey to life






You just can't beat the '80s.  That poor, poor monkey."

Rick Derringer
Real American
WWF Themes

""I am a real American, fight for the rights of every man,
I am a real American, fight for what's right, fight for your life! 

When it comes crashing down, and it hurts inside,
ya' gotta take a stand, it don't help to hide,
Have you hurt my friends, can you hurt my pride,
I gotta be a man, I can't let it slide,
I am a real American, fight for the rights of every man,
I am a real American, fight for what's right, fight for your life! 

I feel strong about right and wrong,
And I don't take trouble for very long,
I got something deep inside of me, and courage is the thing that keeps us free,
I am a real American, fight for the rights of every man,
I am a real American, fight for what's right, fight for your life!""



What a great song!  It embodies everything that being an American mean.  Fighting!  If you do anything, America will kick your ass, and don't you forget it!

I personally like at the end of this song where they just repeat the chorus 90 times and each half line, a high shrill of a voice screams, ""Amerrrricannn!!!""  You NEED to go get this song right now and listen to it until you're ready to kick someone's ass for no reason.  Then go join the army and kill Sadaam Hussein for 911.  

<H1>U.S.A.!!!</H1>

Seriously, download this song and download the song I'm listening to right now.  Hulk rules.  WWF wrestling rules.  I will figure four your ass if you say otherwise!"

Minor Threat
In My Eyes
In My Eyes [EP]


""You tell me that I make no difference
At least I'm fuckin' trying
What the fuck have you done?""

Definitely my favorite Minor Threat song.  No, not because Rage Against The Machine covered it.  Its just a great song that covers lots of great aspects that I believe in.

Thats right, hiatus, bitches!  Mark's DAILY Lyric is back in business."

Beastie Boys

The Sound Of Science

Paul's Boutique

""No one really knows what I'm talkin about.  Yeah, thats right, my name's Yauch""

Then theres a huge pause and an odd drum break.  

Its like Adam Yauch took his role in the Beastie Boys and put it into lyrical form here.  Hes the kinda nerdy one that is definitely the most ""mature"" and almost doesn't fit in.  The pause and stupid drum break just accent this moreso.  That song made me happy after a long day of work.  Just so full of crazy stupid beastie boys humor."

Out of Control

Surrender


""Out of control
Out of control
Out of control

Sometimes I feel that I missunderstood
The rivers run and deep right through my thought
Your naked body lying on the ground
You always get me up when I'm down

And it always seems we're runnin' out of time,
We're out of control
Out of Control
Out of control

Maybe I'm just scared of losin' you
Or maybe it's the things you make me do
It seems to me we both should hang around
And raise the population of this town

And it always seems we're runnin' out of time,
We're out of control
Out of Control
We're out of control
Out of Control

But It doesn't mean we're too far down the line
We're out of control
Out of Control

The record player keeps on turning round
It could be stuck or maybe it's a sound
All the time I should be there with you
But maybe I'm just searchin' for the truth
Or maybe I'm just searchin' for the truth

And it always seems we're running out of time.
We're Out Of Control
Out Of control
We're Out Of Control
Out Of control

But It doesn't mean we're too far down the line
We're Out Of Control
Out Of control
We're Out Of Control
Out Of control

Could be that I'm just losing my touch
Or maybe you think my moustache is too much
Satellite is out of control
But you and I are brothers of the soul
And you and I will come in from the cold

Out of control, Out of control
We're out of control
Out of control"""

Liberator

Everybody wants it all

Too much of everything


""Everybody wants it all, too much of everything.
Its not the world thats getting small, theres too much of everything.""


I don't actually own this album, but Liberator has 5 songs on the ""Hang The VJ"" DVD I own.  Its got like 50 music videos for burning heart records including The Hives, T(I)NC, refused, and more.  

Liberator is a ska band from Sweden.  Their music videos are great and the music is light-hearted good times.  www.liberator.se

The lyrics I picked are great because they're the name of the Song AND Album.  Also, they're really simple and can be missed easily.  However, especially when combined with the great visual of the music video being a series of corny info-mertials, you understand the lyrics that the world is too materialistic.

Save the planet, kiss a whale."

Busta Rhymes Featuring P. Diddy
Pass the Courvoisier-Part 1
Genesis

(I'm) Slick like Fonzareli, and rich like Cunningham.

Now, thats just awesome.  A happy days reference from the main man, bus-a-bus.  The Fonz just kicks ass everywhere, and Busta Rhymes has managed to fuel himself by that awesome power and include the oft forgotten Cunningham.  I don't have much to say, I just enjoy the lyric."

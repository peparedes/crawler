DELICIOUS AND NUTRITIOUS?!  needless to say, i patted myself on the back to congratulate my own genius."

picture this....

senario 1- its prom night.  youve taken forever to get ready.  weeks of planning.  you meet your date.  you take awkward pictures with your parents.  it is ridicously frustrating.  you then proceed to the restaurant where you have to wait forever to be seated.  you dont want to order too much, cause you dont want to feel sick afterwards.  so you order a salad.  and are hungry for the rest of the night.  small talk isnt working.  and you cant go to the bathroom again, you just went five minutes ago.  besides, what the fuck are you supposed to do with all those forks?  youre just eating a salad.  you hate lettuce anyway.

senario 2- its prom nightr.  youve taken forever to get ready.  weeks of planning.  you meet your date.  or you dont, whatever, its not like you have to have a date, GOD BACK OFF.  you smile pretty for the camera but its alright cause youre in a good mood, and the pictures turn out great.  you proceed to the humble abode of a friend.  the door opens and the sound of gunshots, laughter, and ""SARS STOP SCREEN PEEKING"" graces your ears.  someone hands you a piece of pizza and points you in the direction of the queso.  you are in heaven.  after a couple hours of chillaxing and halo, you proceed to prom and have a blast.  you are neither too full (cause you burned it all playing prisoner rockets, duh) or too hungry (cause that queso was damn good).  and you dont have lettuce stuck in your teeth.

a difficult choice we know, but joe and i have confidence you will make the right decision."

also, the most action ive gotten in 10 years was from john preston backstage when i asked him to give me some sugah and he jumped up and smooched me on the cheek. i think im going to kill myself now.  except not really, because i am strangely infatuated with mr. jp. (haha get it? like mr. jt? i am clever. and pathetic.)

also, yes collin, i am saying also on purpose, in reference to john, hi john.

also, the play is going along well and by well i mean the dress rehearsal is in two days and we havent blocked the last scene. yes.

nothing has happened since i last updated which was about 37 months ago.
but also, you can now download linux on livejournal, kind of amusing. thats right, the undergroud is becoming mainstream and techie elitists will have to find something else. hah.
did you know that the christmas stuff they put up in farrish commons doesnt really smell all tree-y? there is a SPRAY that makes them smell. dissapointing. but we do have poker to poke the fire with.  chase and i discovered that we dont in fact know how to make a fire and the mother at the mothers desk had to show us. but we're good at poking. which is alltogether unsurprising. 
my wireless internet finally works which means i can stop stealing my neighboor's connection.  im getting kind of nostaglic. maybe ill send them a virtual fruit basket with those cute little mini muffins that taste like crap. 
also i really want a nap buddy.  maybe ill put out an add.

wanted: nap buddy
requirements-
must smell good
fluffy hair is a big plus(as well as glasses, the rectangle kind with a thin wire rim)
soft pyjama bottoms(breathable cotton is preferred)
one long sleeved cotton shirt with slightly too long sleeves
one snug cotton short sleeved shirt(well worn is the best)
minty fresh breath

yes, a nap buddy is someone who you nap with.  picture it, a rainy afternoon napping with a good smelling soft person. wooooo. andthenmaybesex.

okbye.

also, does anyone want a gmail invite?

im afraid this is going to be a ridiculously useless entry even though it should be a good one since i havent updated in 763 years. exactly.

just got back from maui where everything is beautiful and it makes you feel guitly about being mad because really whats the point.  many attractive people who were tanned to perfection (the type who work out and are on no carb diets of course-this doesnt make them any less hot by the way).  got followed by 4 conspicously inebriated guys who told me ""aloha"" over and over, then realized that it was probably the only word they knew.  finally lost them by turning abruptly and as they had lost their finer motor skills to alcohol, i was safe.

also got stalked by some guy who went to georgetown. he had glasses. hee. unfortunately, found out i was in highschool and awkwardness ensued.

leslie is now mad at me for not inviting her to go with me.  most likely her ovaries are going through testosterone withdrawal. shrivelled ovaries are never good. i expect side effects might occur. 

read field hockey workout plan which caroline said was ""really not that bad"".  have decided that caroline is probably a masochist. its always the ones you dont expect isnt it.

nothing to say about my personal life either because one can not write about nonexistant things unless they are quite fantastical in which case i could talk about my two boyfriends that are fighting over me because i am just too desirable for words. theres a third guy i fuck on the side who is actually the hottest of all three but hes otherwise engaged with a certain floppy haired intellectual and really, who can compete with him?

4. do you really think licking other people is sanitary?

5. how many dates would you wait to have sex with brad pitt (or insert other attractive person here)?  what if he bought you jewelry?  what if he bought you a collar?  what if he was wearing the collar? 

6. would you rather be tied up or tie someone up? during sex of course.

7.which would be more painful-getting mauled by a fat goat or getting your foot run over by a car?

8. what would you like to do to the most annoying person you know? be specific. points for creativity.

9. if you had to choose, which would you rather have growing on your forehead, penis or vagina?

words? in your mouth? i dont think there is enough room in your mouth if you know what i mean. heh. yes. that was dirty. i was implying that you had something else in your mouth. that is funny because it makes people think of fellatio. and fellatio is funny because we think everything sexual is funny. haha. 

that is all for today. tune in later for the next edition of the physics of physics."

"event","Pregnant Love

Candice finished packing. Ever since Hot guy, her own true love, had been lost at sea, Candice had been sunny.

There was nothing left for her anymore, nothing caressed her, all was silky. So today, Valentine's Day, she was going under a tree to become a fuzzy spindle.

Just then, there was a piercing knock at the door. Candice opened it and stood there agonizingly for a moment, before falling to the floor in a swoon and bruising her neck.

When Candice came to, Hot guy was holding her left ass cheek and looking limpid. ""My love,"" Hot guy said spastically, ""I'm sorry for the HUGE shock. I've been shipwrecked on a neato island for the last ten years, living like winter in the summertime. I was only rescued last week."" He paused. ""I lost my eyelash in the wreck. Can you still love me?""

Candice could hardly believe her Hot guy had returned. ""I will always love you, eyelash or no eyelash. Besides, you can cover it up with a bandana."" 

They embraced warmly and vowed to never be parted again.

And all was animelike.

SO COOL. http://prillalar.com/drabbles/"

stupid.
you are not on my friends list.
literally.
whats that you say?
you dont want to be on my friends list?
fine!
then i dont want you on my friends list!
pah!
stupid.

on a similar tangent
if i have been somewhat ""cold"" or snippy to you as of late, it is probably due to one or both of the following reasons

1. i have recently discovered that i have failed in every aspect of my life and am surrounded by a group of annoyingly perpetual nonfailers.  as i do not cope well with failure, surprising as it may seem, i might be slightly put out, a little depressed, and maybe half a pinch bitter.  therefore, although thats not really a good excuse for being mean, dont take it personally.  rather, take it as a compliment that i do not view you as a fellow failure.  of course, fellow failures may also be slighted in the process as my bitterness is pretty much equal opportunity.

2. you are annoying and i do not like you.

good day."

in honor of valentines day, maggi, alex, and i have established the anti-valentines day (february the 13th-a friday to be exact).  it is the antithesis of all that is valentines day. do not be mistaken, this is not hate day. because valentines day isnt really about love is it?  its about being lovey, feeling wanted, and getting some. so i present a challenge.  this unprecedented day remains unnamed and as all great things need a name, we feel that this day deserves no less.  so everyone out there who feels lonely, resentful, or is just in need of a hug, join us in this pathetic celebration of what could be!  put your name down in history as the one who named the antivalentines day. to quote shakespeare and maggi, ""a rose by any other name would smell as sweet"" but is that really true. no! of course not! what if brad pitts name was melvin?  what if your name was melvin? so rack your bitter yet witty brains and come up with a name, and singles everywhere would rejoice.  please leave the name in a comment along with your name and why you think your name (for the day) is best."

""yeah seriously, about the kissing thing. i wonder what made the person who invented kissing think of lips and tongues. think about what it would be like if he had made kissing like touching knee caps with someone else. that would be weird. ""
deserves a prize. just take a moment to picture it in your head.  staring deeping into each others eyes, overcome with passion, intertwined in a passionat er- kneelock?  and then instead of getting hickeys youd just get bruises on your knees. hmmm. and the position would be awkward. do you stand up? lie down? you certainly cant kneel, at least not for that purpose. and its not like you have to come up for air. you just sort of stand there, leaning back so your faces dont get in the way, rubbing knees.  wow.  sexy."

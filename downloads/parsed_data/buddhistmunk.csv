"event","Three girls all worked in the same office with the
 same female boss. Each day, they noticed the boss left work early.
 One day, the girls decided that, when the boss left, they would leave
 right behind her. After all, she never called or came back to work,
 so how would she know they went home early?

 The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little
 gardening, spent playtime with her son, and went to bed early.

 The redhead was elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the
 spa before meeting a dinner date.

 The blonde was happy to get home early and surprise her husband, but
 when she got to her bedroom, she heard a muffled noise from inside.
 Slowly and quietly, she cracked open the door and was mortified to
 see her husband in bed with her boss! Gently she closed the door! and
 crept out of her house.

 The next day, at their coffee break, the brunette and redhead planned
 to leave early again, and they asked the blonde if she was going to
 go with them.

 ""No way,"" the blonde exclaimed. ""I almost got caught yesterday."""

"event","damn it i need a girl friend os i can do something constructive with my time and money, so i dont spend it on stupid shit and on her. i have seen all of the good movies in the theator right now and i spend my money on my friends by buying them movies or food that is $6 all the time and it goes way to fast. if i was spending it no a girl friend i would not feel like i wasted the money. the problem with me gitting a girl friend is very slim because im not the best looking guy and i am shallow. i know this i will only go out with someone who is mildly hot. thus the reason i went for carley but it wasn't all my fault she made it seem that she may like me. so if there is a way for me to get a girl friend that might work tell me, i hate wasting money."

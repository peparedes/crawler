"event","I skipped water aerobics today because Skylar was up all night coughing and wheezy so I decided I should dust and vacuum his room. I am oh so responsible.
Last week was fall-tastic, chilly and rainy, perfect sweater weather. This week is HOT and HUMID. Gross. Too hot for pants.
It seems like right before my monthly blessing begins my body temperature elevates. Or maybe I am just fat. Or hot coffee makes me hotter.
Who knows, but I am sweating like mad right now.

Work is work, very slow lately. Slow work makes me nervous as in the past slow work=impending layoffs. I don't think non profits work the same way though. I cleaned out my desk drawers yesterday, it was pretty nasty.  I am going to training tomorrow, then next week I get to go to a two day out of town training! In topeka! WHoo hoo! I am going to stay in Lawrence  and enjoy a nice little break from the wham bam work kids reality I am entrenched in.
Speaking of Lawrence that's where the Dad of the year is now living. In a room. While still paying rent on his loft in KC. And wonders of wonders, he's behind in giving me da money. Again. He is working, for now. He calls in alot, he already called in on his 4th day. So I don't imagine he will have the job for long.

I went to the dentist, for the first time in 7 years. 2 new cavities, 2 old ones that needed replaced. It was mildly traumatic, I am going to ask for happy gas next time. And not go right back to work with numb mouth and achy jaws.

My garden is winding down, I made a nice little cozy cove area in the back, I will get a chimneria so we can have fires back there. I tried to enjoy a moment of zen this AM but in 3 minutes I got 10 mosquito bites so I came back in.  I also made the boys a little playhouse out of the back storage shed. The boys LOVE it. Skylar told all his classmates, when I dropped him off this AM they were all like did you really make a house? That's right kids, I am industrious.

I have decided to apply for grad school (MSW) this summer. IT will be grueling but worth it in the long run. Let's hope jimi can hold down a job and get me money for at least a year or two so I can finish school!

Oh yeah, Jimmys Dad is giving me his old car! A 98 Mazda 626. Not brand new but a definite upgrade from what I have now! In 3 weeks I will drive to OKC, fly to Dallas, get the car, spend the night, then drive back to the 'ta. THen the next weekend I am going to see Wilco in KC with Laura and the girls, then we will drive groupie style to Iowa City to see them again. I am going to be the Midwest travelin' gal.

I think that is all that is new and different for now. I should probably get ready for work....I am on call this week so hopefully it will stay slow and I will not have to go in at 9pm to break up any fights like last time."

"event","I am on vacation! A no going anywhere just chillin around the house vacation.  I don't have to be back at work until Thursday. (Lisa! Let's get together!!) I took it off to help transition the boys back to school and b/c I didn't want my grandma to have to watch them for two full days, and I really needed a little BREAK.

It's going to be 100 degrees today! Whoo hoo! I think I have reverse SAD. Give me some clouds and cool breezes please! The heat is oppressive. I hate August and the first part of September. 
Except school is starting! On Wednesday! I will once again have a little money in my wallet. I have to promise myself not to freak out about what I am going to do next summer until March. Well maybe February. The kids are stoked about school. We have been counting down the days for a month now. Not having to drive out to the YMCA will give me an extra 30-45 minutes each day. Maybe I could find a new hobby in that time.

Something I noticed yesterday, One of the advantages of living in a holy roller town is I have the place to myself from 9am-Noon on Sundays. A few weeks ago we went school shopping at Target on a Sunday AM and we were pretty much the only people there. That's the way to shop! Yesterday I took the boys swimming at the YMCA and again, we were pretty much the only ones there. The pool just seems cleaner to me when it isn't crowded.

I have been feeling more boring and lonely than usual. I really need to get some kind of social life. 
I have been reading like a maniac, staying up really late. And tending my garden. I have harvested a bunch of cantaloupes, a super sweet big ole watermelon and many many tomatoes. I do want to research to see what kind of fall crops I can plant with our thanks to global warming extended growing season. Maybe peas and potatoes and yams?

On babydaddy-Jimmy got fired from his 4 month old job for missing too many days, sauntering in late, etc. Making almost 80K a year, no weekends, no overtime, just suck it up! So now the lifestyle of the rich and famous I have been afforded by actually receiving child support is coming to a halt. I can still squeeze by but I still have major issues from the stress imprinted in my brain due to living in poverty in the cold, moldy tiny apartment of doom. So yeah, again, he sucks.

The boys and I are heading to Exploration place to use the membership I purchased with my tax return that I haven't used yet to suck up the air conditioning. We were going to take the bus, but never mind. It's too hot.
Then we'll catch some court TV, maybe take a nap, then go swimming this evening at the Y."

"event","I am off of work today, I have forgotten the leisure of a weekday off. The kids are at daycamp. I am half assedly cleaning and full assedly relaxing. It is cloudy and grey. I am kinda crampy and bloated but it could be worse!
I dropped a couple of benjamins on school supplies and clothes at Target yesterday. I will not be fighting the mob for the last bent ruler and tattered tabbed folders on the night before school starts like last year! Hurray! The boys are stoked for school to start (in two weeks!) and so am I!
I had to work both days this weekend so I was granted today off. I have had my eye on this Monday off all week. Besides my grand delusions of cleaning I am also going to go buy myself a new work outfit to go with my new shoes that I got yesterday. I spend it as fast as I make it.
I am still quite boring. We went to see Ratatouille last night. It was a suprisingly good movie. I guess there was a tornado warning while we were in there.  I called work to check in after and the staff told me that the sirens had just stopped. Not on my side of town!  The boys were extremely wired yesterday. The moon? The barometric pressure? A burst of junior testosterone? They weren't fighting or anything. Just far too energetic. First thing this morning I hauled them off to daycamp. They helped make their lunches and we headed out the door. I am going to Lawrence this weekend so the boys can go to a friends birthday party and see their dad and I can visit with friends. I hope my mom sells me her car soon. It costs almost the same as my payment will be to rent one for the weekend. I am so tired of my no air conditioner every bump jostles me to the core car. And I hate summer. It is sweaty and gross and too too long. I look wistfully upon my sweaters everytime I open my closet. But I do have tomatoes and watermelons that I eked out of the sandy ground. Alright I am back to laundry and recycling and showering...."

"event","Hello from the 'ta. I am listening to my headphones and sneaking a beer. Very 1991 here tonight.
I had a great vacation. I want to be on vacation forever. I am rather sad that JImmy is moving out of PHX. I still can visit my crazy ass brother, I'll just have to get a room.(jimmy just accepted a job in KC (2.5 hours away) making 3 times what I make)(which is going to lead to a whole new chapter in my life as a no longer really impoverished, but still qualifying for some state benefits single parent)
The kids had really good time and were much better behaved than they were in alaska. Halleluiah to the game boy. My justification for living in kansas is we must travel. and the cheap cost of living affords such a luxury.
ms. D was a gracious host to my sometimes embarassing brood. They talked to everyone we passed on the sidewalk, people on the bus, you name it. ""Hi! what's your name? where are you going? Is that bling? I learned that in school! We aren't from here. We are going to the ocean! We are going to disneyland!"" Appearantly we are a little bit country, a little bit rock and roll.
They loved the ocean, we got burnt up like tourists. My little brother drove out to meet us after spending the night at the casino. We had a nice visit together. He is still one of my all time favorite people. Even if he sleeps on a bed with no sheets.
I've been suffering from a slight case of vacation deflation, but it was sure nice to not come back all broke and struggling. Just more work. But I do like my job, even though the afterglow is starting to fade, sparkle and fade. We are not as short staffed and does that make a difference.
I am going out to dinner and a movie with a coworker on saturday. Mi madre agreed to watch the boys so i could interact with someone who reads above a 3rd grade level! Rock! I have a new coworker who I really like, already. We are probably kin, me being 1/2 from these parts.
It is time for me to pack up my headphones and brush my teeth and wash my face as tomorrow is ready to greet me. But I will work out at the Y and swim and shower and greet the battered women of wichita with a new attitude and a fresh cup of coffee.
out."

"event","i am at work again. It seems I only post when I am at work. Most likely because there are very few spare moments at home and my computer takes 20 minutes to boot up and I have not the patience for those things.
The flaky ass Saturday person called in AGAIN. I don't think she's going to be hired for the open full time position, or I will throw a fit.
I was shopping in the fat girl section for very cute clothes to wear tonight and on my upcoming travels when I was summoned to the shelter. 
our annual fund raiser is tonight, a mardi gras party, and it is a very big deal and we are expected to be there, bejeweled and such. I hope I don't have to be here. I'd rather be drinking free cocktails!!
I am taking the boys on a vacation! In March! To California and Arizona! I get to see some of my favorite people and Disneyland! Whoo hoo! I am counting the minutes. 6 months of full time employment has just wore me out.
There isn't much to report because my life is really really boring. Work, kids, sleep, eat, work out with the hot personal trainer at the Y, repeat....
The weather is very nice and that has made me happy. I am getting over the fucking consumption/tuberculosis/chest cold of doom and while I still have the cough of a lifetime menthol smoker I am regaining energy which is super.
I just drank a quik trip mocha and it made me feel queasy and buzzed. I skipped Spanish class today so I should go do my homework whilst I am just sitting here (saturdays are slow).
I am so looking forward to hanging out with friends! I might have to travel 2000 miles but dammit, I will socialize! 
Okay, time to hit the books....
Adios."

I don't find myself nearly as entertaining as the girls in Lawrence but I can try. THings have been good, hectic, but good. I have decided I want to get back into music again. We have a garage that we can't put a car in so what would be the next best thing? A drum set! I think that would be just the hobby I am looking for.
I have to stay awake for 5 more hours. Can I do it? I've got strong coffee and cream to help me through. 
I am waiting for my W2 to make its way to my mailbox so I can get some money!
And go on a vacation. That's the best part of working, the vacation.
I need to go move around, that seems to be key to keeping alert."

Oh yeah, all of my coworkers! Drink some damn water! I'd be more sympathetic but I really had great plans for my Saturday with no children. And i'm salaried so there is no extra money for my extra 10 hours either. This person calls in every time I am on call. It's a good thing I am not the boss because I am cranky.  And i didn't bring lunch so I just ate a day old doughnut and it is making ME feel sick. If she doesn't surface soon I will probably start calling other coworkers to help split this shift. It would keep me from martyring around the office next week but I really don't want to be here today. I had curtains to make! And cable to rewire! And I didn't get enough sleep so I have that tired eye feeling. It's really slow and boring which is better than all crazy but the time just DRAGS.

"event","The boys school had a fundraiser at a rollerskating rink and it was FUN! I haven't skated in 20 years. At first I was a little hesitant, smacking the cement with all this extra weight would not have been pleasant, but after a few laps I got my groove back!
I am off of work today because I worked veterans day (played hearts on the computer all day long)
Scott is here and we are at the library because my mom seemed to have lost the laptop in the divorce. We should be moving in a few weeks. I feel bad about pulling the kids out of school mid semester but they will adapt. And I promise to keep them at the next school for at least 2 years. Pinkie promise.
Things are still going along. Jimmy and his entire family descended upon the wichita metropolitan area for moreys birthday party. We had it at this black light mini golf place. It was really cool, actually. Several kids from school came, and Lisas crew. We got everyone all sugared up and sent them on their way! lisa and I are going to go mini golfing sometime during the next blue moon when neither of us have to work of have our kids. for reals.
I had a nice urban experience of having my kids birthday presents stolen out of the car while at the grocery store picking up candles on the way to the party. I had been out at the country club for the YWCA's annual luncheon and was still riding high on the fumes of luxury, so I forgot to lock my car. Luckilty it was all stuff jimmy had bought and given to me because ""i would have more free time"" to wrap th presents. I had already given the kid his presents and he got a ton of cool stuff from his party, so from my perspective, I am not as sickened by it as I could be. stupid crackheads.
Someone over here in the computer section is farting. I love public computers!!
So anyway, things are still plugging along, nothing major to report.
I am going to peruse for dvds and books. I had to pay my fines before I could use the computers! scandalous!"

"event","I went to work as the premenstrual fairy on halloween. Even though I was grouchy and full of pre blood tension on the inside, on the outside I was sparkles and glitter! It was actually kind of fun. The fairy wings and bobble headband helped keep me from kicking  and cussing at the copier.  The kids were (eye roll) a pirate and a power ranger. BORING! I wanted them to be batman and robin which would have been ADORABLE! but no. Trick or Treating in the suburbs was lucrative. We even got business cards!
My brother is here for a few days, I am taking him up to Lawrence this weekend. He is doing better, his kidneys have regained functioning, which is amazing, but he still has A LONG WAY to go before he is close to normal. I think he is in a pretty good headspace, well as good a headspace as hydrocodone allows.
I have a friend for Morey to spend the night with Saturday, I just need to find someone to pawn the other child off on. I am making frantic phone calls today. This mama needs a day off. STAT!
Jimmy is coming into town next week for Moreys birthday which is AWESOME as they have Friday off from school and I won't have to pay the sitter. And I will have a whole weekend off. And Lark is coming down to hang out Saturday. We will get a motel room stumbling distance from the clubs.Well
Some mormon boys are coming over at 11. I guess I need to break up with them, but they are so earnest.
I have decided that the boys are going to Jimmys for the entire summer. All of June and July are going to be mine! Well, the YWCA and mine. If I get into grad school I'll have to take a class over the summer anyway so it will be perfect. He can figure out childcare and groceries and all of that.
I am off to take a shower and pick up the rental car (it's cheaper if I pick it up on thursday ) and get ready for a grueling day. We had 8 little kids come into shelter last night, and 2 of them were more hyper than my kids. And that is something new. I let someone in who had been permanently banned because of drug and alcohol issues b/c she was about to get her baby taken into custody b/c of domestic violence. I am a sucker. And social workers are pushy. hee hee.
Happy November! It's finally not hot!"

Not really.
I am going to make an appointment for a well woman visit first thing. Dentist will follow.
Spent the weekend in kansas city visiting my dumbass brother. He is doing a lot better, still not well, but much better. His kidneys are starting to work a bit and he can move around, but he is in a lot of pain from the giant chunks of muscles being removed from his left arm and leg, and he's still really puffy and can't really move his left arm.
He might come here for a couple of weeks so there are  more people that can take care of him, he can't do stairs either. But I don't think he's going to die in the next couple of weeks.
Work is still good. I am considering going to grad school, but I don't know. It doesn't seem like I have very much free time right now, with the full time job and 2 kids and all, but I know that I could cut back 1 day of work and go part time. I need to earn more than 13 dollars an hour. For real.
I also need to get ready for work and go to the store and all of that. so good day!"

I gave him a math worksheet and before I could turn around he was done with it. I was annoyed and told him to take his time there was no way he could be done. But he insisted he was, so I checked his answers and they were all right! This is from a kid who couldn't write his name or read anything this time last year! Rock! I told Jimmy that they were both doing really well in school and he said, They take after me I guess. Yeah dude, you are just bursting with wisdom and fine choices and you have just been so there for them, it MUST be you!! Fucker. 
Work still rocks, there are days when I feel like I need a lot more schoolin' and others when I feel like I am pretty darn good at it. I am applying to grad school though, because if I am going to be in this field I may as well make the big bucks.
Mom, the boys and I are going to KC this weekend to visit Scott. He's still in the hospital, still not doing exceptionally well, still on dialysis. I've always heard about people who overdosed and died, or people who overdosed and pulled through it in a few days. I've never heard about people who overdose and are fucked up the rest of their lives. I think I've moved from anger to denial, I want to pretend it isn't real and we will go garage saling and ride our bikes to the bar for a couple of cocktails anytime now.
And vices, how I've been thinking about vices. I want to stop drinking coffee so I don't have any addictions, but there is always going to be something I want I want I want.
I've been swimming and or yoga and or walking every day so maybe that can be my new addiction. Ya can't tell by looking at me but I'm a fitness junkie! HA!
I am off to the store to spend some of my directly deposited paycheck on booster seats for my moms car and a birthday present for my sibling who will be spending his 31st birthday in the hospital."

But he's going to be in the hospital for a LONG time, he is not okay, he may never be okay. And no, I am not giving him one of my kidneys because he will continue to drink and I am just not going to sacrifice my health for that.
I am still mostly in the angry phase. I am sad for my mom, and for the loss of all he's worked for, the house, the car, the pilots license. All of that is GONE.  Or going to be gone.
I couldn't be in the hospital room. I am not the girl you want in there if there are wounds and drainage pumps and dialysis ports. I kept gagging and wanted to yell ""what the fuck did you do to yourself"" the whole time I was there, so I cut my visit short. I am back with my  boys and my job and while I feel horrible about the whole thing, I have to keep my life going. I can try to be supportive to him and to my mom and make money because he's going to fucking need it.
There is  a pallor hanging around me, for sure, and I hope I can stay angry because I won't function as well as if I were weepy.
Thanks for all your kind words and I guess keep thinking happy renal thoughts for the guy because so far it looks like he might be on dialysis for the rest of his life. And since the situation that brought him there was drug related he is ineligible to be on the donor transplant list. And I already told you how I feel about my kidneys. 
So, there it is, I am holding up just fine and will make it through."

I don't know how it happened, I would guess either the 3 years of hard drinking got to him quick, or he took some kind of pill with all the liquor.

The only things I didn't know were the names of systems theories and specific stuff that I would probably remember if I hadn't finished school 8 years ago. So yeah. I am a legitimate citizen. As I was driving away from the test site, feeling so smart and such, I took a hard left and tipped over a completelely full 5 gallon water bottle into the back floorboard of my car. Now my car smells like musty ass. Cause I'm smooth like that.
Mom and I looked at a house last night. It's a duplex but it's HUGE. I am excited for her. Something about a single woman being able to buy a house on her own just makes me happy. I'd help with the bills and such while I am there, but it's still affordable enough for her to manage when I don't live there. Which is good. As well as things are going here, I don't like the thought of anything having to be permanent. And I do want to live in Alaska again, someday.
Last week I started to manhate for a minute, with the school shootings that targeted girls and my job and such. But I think I am over it. Now I am not a  manhater, but a man-sceptic.
My coworker got engaged last week and the wedding is this weekend. Which I am glad about because I couldn't handle months of wedding talk. It will be interesting, a christian/muslim wedding.

I went for a long walk and wrote for awhile and went to bed where I dreamt I was runing my new pjs with my blood (I was) and actually woke up feeling alright.
I took  morey to tiger scouts yesterday and lets just say, ew. This will be the last year we do it. It's okay because I am there and I am in charge of crafts and I can use my wiles to influence little boy minds with feminist dogma, but there are lots of things about it that make me uncomfortable. The same things that make me uncomfortable about living in middle america society so no suprise. I was crampy and bloated and really wanted nothing more than to lie on the couch with some brownies and a heating pad and watch sappy movies but I persevered. It was good bonding time.
I switched to 8-5 on Mondays so I can do the forementioned tiger cubs and that probably made me cranky too. I wish my body was fine with working 8-5 as it will be most convenient when both boys are in full time school (either this year when we move into the wichita district or next year when sky is in 1st grade). But it makes me crabby and hate my life. Why working later doesn't do that to me I will never know. And I am a mess until 10 am. I forgot all kinds of things and spilled coffee all over the crisis call book yesterday am. Luckily I work with very lovely ladies and no one cared.
Today is Tuesday. This weekend I take the LBSW exam. Next weekend we have a huge garage sale (I cleaned 4 garbage bags of shit from the kids room this weekend). The kids just had 5 days off of school for parent/teacher conferences. The poor babysitter.  She rocks though. I'll have to get her a quite nice xmas gift.
So it's back to normal, back to school, back to work la la la.
I cleaned out my car so I won't be embarassed if I have to give someone a ride.

I now have shoes that have never been worn by anyone else and they are cute. I needed some new things. 4 years of dressing in rags is enough. Really. Besides, Lark is finishing her business degree and she explained how my lack of shopping could endanger my job. Ha.
So it was nice.
But, when I got home, it was all tense and weird (as it has been for many years in this house) and I found out my mom is getting a divorce! Hurray! She has been so unhappy for so long and I am proud of her for  finally putting her foot down. So now there is the whole packing/moving thing, but we are going to get a house together. So even with my shitty ass credit I will soon be a partial homeowner. She has a lot of financial untangling to do, and this house has to be put on the market, but within a few months we shall be moving again! But that's okay because I have wanted to see her w/out him for about 14 years. It's a hard thing to do at 54 years old but she is doing it. And we'll move closer to my work and the kids can go to school in wichita instead of out in the country burbs.
Skylar has a horrible asthma attack Thursday night, I didn't think I would even get to go to Lawrence he was up ALL night. I had to break out the nebulizer, I haven't had to use it since April. Living in the mold hole wasn't good for him that's for sure.  He's doing better, still has the cough of doom but nothing like it was. Damn sickly kids.
And the spot on Moreys foot that landed him in the hospital this summer is starting to look weird again. Maybe I should make some doctors appointments right now....
So I am off to grocery shop and fold laundry and start something for dinner and drop skylar off at the bus stop and pay the  babysitter and go to work!"

Today I pick up my rental so tomorrow I can beg off of work early and head to Lawrence for a kid free weekend of fun!
My next big purchase is going to be a car. One that I can count on for the next 5-10 years. No more beaters! Mine is still running, it just has no suspension and can't go over 45 mph, which is fine for getting to work.
Work is good, the kids are good, I wouldn't feel as good about it if they were going to the babysitters for all the hours I am gone, but they are with a grandma that loves them so much, and it's showing in their behavior. I gave in and let morey join the tiger cubs. My mom has to take him and stay at the meetings so he's not there with strangers and really, it's not like he has a dad or step dad or anything around, and I really don't want my brother to be his only male role model. Not that scott isn't hilarious in his own right, but he's still a little sleazy.
Jimmy is kinda being an asshat.  He's still being ultimatim-y and threatening to sue me for custody, but I am not really worried about it. Bring it on dude. Bring it on. I told him the only place I would be willing to move is Alaska and I know his skinny ass won't go for that so he'll have to figure something else out. It was his choice to move to Arizona, plain and simple. He can blame me for divorcing him blah blah blah, but it was his drunken decision to drive 2000 miles away from his kids in the middle of the night. So yeah, bring it on.
I need to go make something to eat at work as 9 hours with baby carrots and a cup of yogurt will not work out.
My childrens group last night was wild, 8 kids under the age of 6, 3 toddlers and one teeny baby. We just played on the playground and blew bubbles and made crafts while I kept the toddlers from putting things in their mouth. Tonight I have a volunteer who sits with the little ones so I can do a group with the older kids. Thursdays kick my ass though, they really do.
But that's okay because tomorrow is Friday and my first full paycheck! whoo hoo!
TIme to go get dressed and ready for this rainy busy day."

My mom is coming home at noon when I go to work so I won't have to call in! Yay Mom!  This is why I moved here, I have to remember that.
The job is still going well, no major complaints yet. I am making all the necessary mistakes one has to make to learn a new job. We had a drug and alcohol inservice yesterday and later this week I am going to go tour some transitional housing and the other shelter.
Tonight I start shelter storytime, since bedtimes seems to be a struggle there. 

My morning off is not as relaxing as I had hoped, since I've spent it sanitizing the bathroom and washing sheets and blankets and accidentally burning a pot of potatoes on the stove. Oh well.
I've been bleeding for 7 days now, and enough! I am out of pads!
Someday I will be able to sleep in, right?

I need to go get ready for work and finish all my chores.

Yesterday, as part of my ""training"", one of my coworkers handed me a couple of crackpipes that she had found in someones room. I thought she was getting some forms or something for me to read so imagine my suprise!! She got all distracted after that and wandered off leaving me holding on to the pipes. It was kinda funny.

My cousin and I walked last night. I haven't been making it to the pool this week as I am bleeding like a stuck pig and working full time doesn't seem to leave as much time.
I didn't get home until 11pm the other night, to be back up at 7 to get Morey to school. But that was an exception, I couldn't leave at the usual time because there was a suspicious Lincoln cruising around the shelter.
My brothers cell phone has been shut off for over a week, which hasn't happened in years.  I am somewhat worried but imagine that he's fine. I enlisted Jimmy to go over to his house and check stuff out. With all his goddamn free time.
I scheduled my LBSW exam for Oct. 7. I don't even need it for this job, but what the hell. Hopefully I pass, 175 dollars down the drain if not. I'll cram right before and utilize my best test taking skills.
Etc. Etc.

I spent the afternoon in protection from abuse/stalking court yesterday. Talk about a party.
I am glad it is Friday, getting up so early every day to get morey to school after working late is wearing me out. Plus it's cloudy and grey and I'd really rather be in bed.
Morey is having problems in school. He's not being really bad, but he's getting in trouble for little things every day.  Yesterday he was ""feeling Ben's muscles"" as they lined up to go home and squeezed too hard and got in trouble for that. I guess I am going to see if he can talk to the counsellor at school, and if not, I will try to find one in the community that he can talk to. I feel like he has some trouble with respecting peoples personal space and he doesn't know when play stops, as well as not knowing his own strength.  Needless to say these are problems that I want to nip in the bud ASAP.
So there is the guilt, that I took him out of a small school where he was adored  and knew everyone to put him in some kind of suburban baby factory where he knows no one and seems to be getting off on the wrong foot. And some little girl called him a ""redneck"" yesterday.
Jeez.
But it's a three day weekend and I get paid for not working on Monday, which rocks. I think my period is about to start and I just wish it would because I am cranky and foggy and my boobs hurt.

Yesterday was exciting, there were fire alarms, abusers coming to the shelter, police calls, furniture rearranging, prescription drug I.D.ing and it goes on and on!  I let someone in who was supposed to be coming in, but a coworker who seems very distracted had put the paper in the wrong place so after I let the woman in I couldn't find her on the admit list and felt like I had done A VERY BAD THING by letting someone in the shelter who wasn't supposed to be there (but she was). We also went looking for a client in the van, I tamed an unruly toddler, and studied a bunch of spanish phrases (I am the spanish speaking worker!!!)  It is not going to be a dull job, there will be no clock watching and everyday will be different.  Tomorrow i get to go to the PFA hearings with the court advocate. No one expects much of me yet, because I don't have computer access or phone training. Next week I will be expected to do more, but that is okay, I am excited about it.
The kids love their babysitter, she seems very nice and cool and charges ridiculously little for her services.
I don't have to be at work until 11 or 12 so I have a bit of time in the morning to go swimming at the Y, run errands, etc.
My car has been condemned, she needs 1600 dollars worth of work (struts) so I am basically going to drive her (to work only) until she grinds to a halt. Jimmys dad is giving him his old car (a 98 maxima) and Jimmy said he would be willing to give it to me for my car that he thinks he can fix.
But this was the same drunken (on his part....I don't have time /$$ to touch the hooch anymore) conversation in which he gave me 3 options.
1) move to phoenix
2) send one of the boys to live with him
3) go to court for custody
He added on option 4) both of us move to the same city after I told him I did not want to live in Phoenix again, that I am not in any position to move right now,  etc.
He called at 11pm and I was in bed because I have a cold and well, my life is not conducive to late nights anymore then he got all mad when I pointed out that HE was the one who took off in the middle of the night and I have to be able to support us because his support is wavery. Jackass. But if i get a newer car for free I can tolerate some bullshit I guess.

I just swam for 30 minutes in the clear blue cool lap pool and my arms are like rubber. RUBBER!! I am eating a banana in hopes of staving off aching muscles. There are yoga classes and weight training classes and a hot tub. I am in love.
I was all astressed yesterday and this morning because I start work on Monday and lo and behold the latchkey program (which I naively assumed based on my experiences in Lawrence were there for my convenience) was FULL. Full to the point they laughed at me and told me if I wanted to get on the list for next year now was the time to sign up. So I called around to a couple of home daycares, for 10 hours a week of childcare, they wanted to charge me between 100-140 a week. That's more than I was paying for almost 3 times that last year. But just as I was about to surrender all hope of ever having gainful employment, I receieved a list of childcare providers that I requested several days ago, all located within a stones throw of here, called one that is literally 3 blocks away, and she wants 30 bucks a week. SWEET! We will go over there Friday afternoon and meet her and feel it out. 
So now I am aerobicized and back in a good mood! Except for my rubber arms and the wart (EW) on my finger.
So things are looking up again. Tomorrow while the kids are in school I am going to go to the library and find books on parenting classes and support groups for battered women.

They seem very willing to let me work a flexible schedule so I won't be spending a large percentage of my wages on before kindergarten care for Skylar! I am excited to start (on the 28th). I had a hunch I was going to get the job because the interview went really well, I've worked as a case manager in a shelter before etc.
So cool.
I got morey off to the bus stop at 7:49 am (!!) so early. I took skylar and the dog for a short walk around the burb abd then went back to bed for 45 minutes while skylar quietly played. His bus comes at 12. Then for the rest of the day I am going to study for the LBSW exam and read some of the books I have for my new job.
I need to find a sitter for the 45 minutes between the kids getting home and my mom getting home. I am hoping to find a 12-13 year old who lives in the neighborhood and can just hang out and eat snacks and watch PBS kids with them after school. Who works for cheap!

We go to the open house tonight, their school is called Vermillion. What a weird name for a school. But it is only pre K-1st grade so there will be no big kids there. It is weird going to a not title 1 school. I'd never be able to afford to live in a not poor neighborhood on my own. Maybe the suburbs aren't all that bad for now.
I rode my bike to my cousins house last night, it isn't far, but it involves a stretch on a two lane county road with no shoulders, so that was a little terrifying.  I rode as fast as I could to get back on the city street before a car came up behind me. I've been walking for at least an hour every day, not counting the little bike trips and playing with the kidsa at the park. I am getting ripped. Ha.  
One of the perks of the YWCA is I could get a free YMCA membership and they just built a gorgeous rec center right down the road. Physical fitness, here I come!

Lets see, what else....I got my transcript in the mail, I thought I graduated with a 2.97, but it was a 2.99! Whoo hoo! And that didn't count my year at K-State, so I have a nice 3.0.

Morey has been sleeping for 14 hours straight. i don't want to wake him up to check on his foot, but it wasn't looking very good last night. he was up on it as soon as we got home last night, wrasslin' with his brother and what not. I am going to have to keep him inert. Barring drugs, how does one keep an otherwise healthy 6 year old motionless? jeez. And we don't even know what happened. The assumption is that he stepped on something and got strep bacteria in there (we initially thought it was staph...scary)
the hospital was sucky. It was a really nice place, and the people that worked there were AWESOME and took really good care of my baby and all the other babies, but wow, something about the concept of a childrens hospital, a pediatric ICU is very depressing. All the parents were baggy eyed and exhausted looking. It was strange to be out at evilMart to get morey some games to keep him motionless and see babies w/out I.V's and bandages and face masks. ( my mom promised him a game boy while in the thick of painful procedures but balked at the price, she got him a plug and play sponge bob game and hopes he won't notice the difference ha)
i didn't really sleep there, too loud, too bright, I had weird dreams about him having a really high fever and cardiac arrest and shit. The last night I started having an anxiety attack. Needless to say we were both very ready to go home.
I wish I could get the images of him having to be held down by 6 people to get in the IV and lance his foot out of my head. And I know it could be so so so so much worse.  My heart goes out to everyone who is dealing with a seriously ill child. That's the kind of tragedy you can't even articulate.
But anyway. It kept me from having to get a job for another week.
Mom took me out for a couple of drinks last night because I really needed it. I guess I didn't need it but I wanted it. And she got a virgin daquiri and the completely adorable waiter was teasing her, now if you get too rowdy we'll have to kick you out. She likes it when cute youngsters flirt with her.
speaking of cute youngsters...when did doctors get so young? I woke up at 5:30 one day in the hospital and doogie howser was in the room! My favorite resident who I had a crush on was such a sweetie. She looked like jimmys sister and was So nice to morey. She is going to be the one I see when I go to the clinic.

Oh yeah, and health care rant!!!
Sunday we had gone to the ER, we were sent home with a big bottle of antibiotics and instructions to follow up with my family practice doctor. But we just moved here and don't have one yet. No problem, I thought. Even though the kids are on healthwave (medicaid) I have never been denied except for  a dentist or two. Monday a.m. the thing on morey's foot is still growing, his foot is turning red and white and it is freaking me out. So i start calling every pediatrician/family practioner in the wichita phone book. One after another after another, we don't accept medicaid.
wow.
no wonder people abuse the ER. It's the only place you can go!!!
Finally I called the insurance co and asked them for some names b/c I was getting very defeated. even the docs that accepted healthwave weren't taking any new patients.
So eventually I called the big catholic hospital and it's adjoining clinic. Not only were they very nice to me, they got me RIGHT in, and the doctor had morey admitted immediately b/c that shit was serious. So they have my vote and business and  when I get real insurance (which is suddenly a priority) I will stay with them. 
I have a lot of things to catch up on, figure out the school thing, keep a kid inert. But we are fine and I hope the worst of this business is over.

I have been the little housewife, keeping my moms house clean and having dinner ready when she gets home. So far everyone seems content with the arrangement. This house is ridiculously huge for just 2 people anyway.
I am getting my social work license, and am going to start taking one class at a time at the university to perfect my spanish and my GPA and then apply to grad school, either MSW or law. 
I am not stuck any more. I am moving forward, I am not stressed out, My kids have a gaggle of people around them that think they hung the moon. And I get to watch peoples court and judge judy every day until I get a job!!
It's record breaking hot out there but it is nice and cool inside. And I don't have to pay the bills. For now.
Another goal is to save up money while I am living here and then buy a house and/or land. Renting is ridiculous. I have paid so much rent in my lifetime it is time to start obtaining something to leave to my kids.
My mom took me shopping for work/interview clothes because all of my clothes were shabby ripped, ill fitting and gross. It is nice to have something that I know is presentable.

But then the landladies will never rent to single moms again and I don't want to ruin anyone elses chances.
I hurt my back trying to move a really heavy bookshelf by myself.
I need some strapping friends. stat. and a massage. My rotator cuff pops everytime i move my arm. 

My mom and her hb, and my aunt are all going to come up next saturday (7 days!!!!) and then we are out of here.
I am a little sad, I guess, but it is swallowed by the practicality of being overwhelmed.
And I don't know what to do with the damn cat.
And I have TO MUCH SHIT. and that is exactly what it is. Ugly, mismatched, broken down SHIT. When I am rolling in the benjamins I will stroll to the second hand store and buy a matching set of table and chairs godammit.
I am ready to get out of this house and out of this town.
I need to pop some advil and get it done. It will be over soon enough.
I made enough $$ at the moving sale today to keep the water on until I leave. And there is a lot less I have to carry.

Blind perseverence and the sacrifice of any kind of personal growth or social life I guess.

Goodbye Lawrence, where I've lived for 9 years (with 4 years of Phoenix interspersed).
I am excited about taking the licensing exam, about applying for jobs with health insurance, about not paying rent next month, about going to Phoenix for 10 days as long as my brother stays out of jail (paryting at bonnaroo).

After 3 months of non stop family togetherness I have enrolled the kids in summer day camps (yay scholarships!!) and they will be blissfully entertained from 9am through 4 pm the next 3 weeks. If'n we can get up that early. My eyes don't open before 9:30 am these days. Damn time zone. I am working up a sweat sitting here I HATE IT!!
I took the kids for a 5 mile bike ride last night, morey rode on his own. He's getting huge, all solid.  I pulled skylar in the trailer, we went down some of the foresty bike trails, it was actually kind of fun, going down big hills and bumping the trailer over tree roots and such. There were no mishaps I am happy to report.
Scott used my house/yard while I was gone to assemble 13-16 rickshaws. It wasn't as clean as I left it, but not that bad either, except now I keep blowing fuses and my computer has made threatening pops with sparks and blue smoke if it gets bumped in the back.
I am starting to feel a bit uggy about moving to my moms. I just have to keep it in perspective, as much as it sucks, is it worth 800-1000 dollars a month? yes. 
and it doesn't have to be permanent.
I've been thinking about where I went wrong with my parenting when my kids were toddlers, because believe me, I did something wrong. And I think it's that I never taught them boundaries.  All the hippie parenting books that suggested keeping them away from conflict, moving away things that you don't want them to touch, redirecting, all of that, kept me from teaching them that there are lines that we all have to learn not to cross.
And I don't think it's too late, but it's harder now than it would have been if I were teaching them at 2 and 3 and 4 that they do have the self control not to dump my shampoo in the waterk, that there are some things that they just can't do.
They have huge issues with respecting peoples boundaries, they will hang on people and not get off when that person asks them too. I have problems with that. They will take strangers hats. I guess it will just take them getting smacked or something a few times before they fucking get it.
And I blame jimmy too because that is just very very convenient.
anyway.
they are playing right now, morey did the dishes this morning, we need to go get some money to my landladies so they can make their mortgage payment, then drop them off at the new sitters (which they really seem to like), and head to work for 7 hot hours.

Usually when I travel (which granted is not often) I am eager to come home to my body pillow and queen sized bed and comfortable routine.
But this time, the thought of leaving makes me cry.
I am meeting family that I haven't seen, people I haven't seen in so many fucking years.
All of my dad's siblings minus one (5 total) and their kids all came to a last minute picnic because I was in town. And my kids were being total assholes. And everybody is old, older, old. It was like laughing so hard and tearing open an old wound. I never wanted to leave this place, I was too young to make it on my own, and now I don't want to leave it again. I am not hot, the air smells sweet, the promise of summer is in the air. But do I want to deal with 30 below and plugging in my car and driving through feet of snow?
I don't know.
I hung out with my 2 of my 5 stepsisters, who grew up with my dad when I didn't, and are around the same age as me. We got alone beautifully. the three of us polished of 2 bottles of tequila blended into fruit puree. Hurting the next day but talk about your bonding. THey both have 2 kids each and they all got along really well.
It's 10pm and sunny as hell here. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!
The thought of trudging through life in the flatlands makes me so so sad.
I took the kids to the ocean (5 hour trip)  and camping in Homer. I hate camping in any place, but they loved it. I chartered a short boat ride, I got seasick(sucker tourist!!)
I have felt nothing but welcomed, even by my aunts compulsively clean child free husband, who loaded me up with all his camping gear.There are espresso stands all over the place, even in the middle of the woods. who knew?
I am really happy right now.
But would I feel the same in December?
Who knows?

A flight attendant bought me a drink even.
I love this state. No where else can you leave junked out cars and buses and tractors around and not have neighbors phoning their anonymous complaints. The air smells right, the water tastes right (you can drink it right from the tap!) and people love a good cup of coffee.
It is so different than the Alaska I grew up in, with the satellite TV and internet and radio stations from Fairbanks.
The kids are still obnoxious and must be wrested from the cartoons to enjoy the scenery. We are all sleeping awesome, even with the pretty much constant daylight.
We've done some sightseeing, mostly playing on the farm equipment and dirt piles and woods on the property. I tried to take a trip to a little mountain we used to go to back in the day but the whole area has been taken over by the military and their red warning flags scared me.
We spent some time on the bank of the clearwater river and the boys played in the sand while i listened to music.
It's just been nice, simple, fun, nice.
This weekend we are going down to the town I was born in to visit my aunt and will take a trip to the ocean so there will be more sightseeing action there.
This is the farm belt. People work their asses off but I really really like it here and feel like I belong.
I've built a birdhouse and a stool out of woodscraps. WHolesome shit ya'all.
Today's tough itenerary includes a trip to the brand new library (it's raining buckets) and post card writing.
I should have enrolled the kids in school for 3 weeks. They are jonesing for other kids. Morey told me yesterday he misses all his class and wishes they were here.
So yeah, I am here and it is normal and I don't have to cook and that rocks.

Not like bottle of liquor and cases of beer every day like my brother, but a couple of beers here, a glass of wine there, and really, it doesn't taste good so it seems like there is no point in consuming alcohol except for the buzz.
Or I don't know and I didn't want to be around my kids all damned day with no kind of support or reinforcements and their voices make me want to pluck out my eyes. And they won't go to sleep. But I did it, complete with a trip to the lake with a picnic, movies, foray to library and park. THis house is starting to stress me out with all it's problems that i have to fix.

"event","I've been thinking about what kinds of things would my nanny do, what his or her hours would be etc. This is all pure fantasy, dear readers, lest you think I've been faking my lower socioeconomic status.
I am going to call her her, for traditional purposes. I think my guys would love to have a male nanny/caretaker since they have no male figure in their life right now, but I would be skeptical about another penis in my space. Especially if he left the seat up.
Anyway.
Morning duties would be primary, getting the kids up, dressed and make them (and me) breakfast and a nutritious sack lunch to take to their alternative, outdoorsy, diverse, kick ass school. They would not be presented to me until all boogers have been blown out, no eye crust remains and a good thorough tooth brushing has been completed. This would all be completed in the childrens wing, so there is no risk of noise interfering with my precious sleep. This would get rid of the bags under my eyes and minimize my haggard look.
I guess she could have the day off, after cleaning up the breakfast dishes, until it was time to pick them up from school.
After school she could prepare them a healthy snack and work on homework and take them on an outing. At this point I would delegate the dinner preparing responsibility to my cook while sitting on the porch swing with a fine wine. I guess I would be writing all day, making phone calls, doing some networking, maybe taking power naps. Oh yeah, I would have to go to the gym so I can have six pack abs. I will have to buy some spandex for this fantasy, but that is OKAY!
After dinner she would do some free play time with them, making sure they were awash in educational and brain challenging puzzles. No ninjas or TV. She would get them scrubbed up and in cute PJ's at which point they would be paraded before me like the dad on Mary Poppins, I would kiss them goodnight and send them on their way.
She would get them to bed, I'd hand her her days wages, with a healthy bonus and bid her adieu until the next day.
I feel more refreshed just thinking about it.
I suppose having another parent around could fill some of these duties, but it just seems more realistic to pay someone to take care of my kids than to expect someone to do it for free, just because they loved my grouchy ass and my kids sneezing snotty, ceaseless squibbling selves.

I spend too much time hanging out with young uns.
Today we washed windows, Morey was actually somewhat helpful. I wonder what the school must think when they see a 6 year old helping. No wonder she bid so low!

All I wanted to do all day was sleep, but I couldn't.  So I lounged until I busted ass. I work really hard and it's going to be really nice not to for awhile. 
I've been cyberbrowsing the town I grew up in, people I went to school with are teachers! Crazy. The want ads make me smile. For the same price as a dubious basement, dubious foundation, crowded in a muggy city house here, I could get a brand new sparkling pristine view house there. Not that I'm one of those jet setting homeowners, but when I am a high roller my dollars will have to go far.
I hope I don't absolutely want to stay there once I set foot in the homeland. I definitely fit in better there than this inbred backwater though. My mom would be devestated and I'd be leaving some shit untied here, we'll see how it feels. 
It's lightening off to the Northeast and to that I say BOO! Bring it on! Maybe not those gustinados that ripped my screen door off, but is it too much to ask for a little thunder and lightening?
I am sunburnt and wine tipsy and if Lark doesn't call soon I am going to eat a bowl of cereal (dinner) and watch bad TV!
I gave the kids this weird combo of things for dinner but it was balanced and healthy and I haven't had to cook for a few days.
Tomorrow is tofu day, and take Skylar to the dr. and plead for a nebulizer day. And maybe my brother is in town day.

May's rent is already paid, as are my bills, so it's not the money nag keeping me up at night. Maybe it's excitement or spring or something. But I am so fucking tired right now and I really want to not have to be a mom today. Last night when I couldn't sleep I read for awhile and cleaned the house. I wanted to take a shower because I felt filthy from being outside all day but I didn't want to sleep on wet hair. Not that I slept. I drank some sports Tea from Yello sub at 8pm or so, maybe that did it. 
The earth day festival was yesterday and I worked the tofu booth. This year we charged, I think we made around 100 dollars. I like food vending. Especially healthy food vending. This one guy came up all snotty, asking if the bread was vegan, ready for me to say no, like we are a bunch of chucklehead tofu makers, putting chicken broth in the shit or something. It was nice to say yes and smile at his grumpy hungry self. He was the only rude customer all day, it was quite fun and time flew. The kids played like mad, running around with the earthball and in the fountain with their friends. Morey made a bird house and saw lots of kids from school. It was a good time and I made some money. 
We are all sniffly with allergies or some such thing, and Skylar is wheezing, he sounded terrible last night. I guess I should try agian to get our medicaid pediatrician to admit the kid has asthma so I can get a nebulizer. I just feel better having that thing around, especially going into a totally different climate.
I think my brother is going to be here for a few days this week. hopefully I can wrest him from his love den and get some free child care out of it.
I should probably go supervise the wheezing spies prowling around outside.

And Moreys teacher said she was disappointed, she was looking forward to having Skylar next year. (As he was stepping on my feet and head butting me!!!)  I really hope our future schools are as fucking cool as this one was. Morey got his class picture, but it was taken on a day when he was absent. Story of my life. Repeat.
We rode our bikes to story time at the library today, I almost had to leave. There were so many little toddlers and babies screaming and all over the place. It literally hurt my head. I only found 1 or 2 to be cute. I am such a bitch. The boys were perfectly behaved which is unusual. They were probably overwhelmed. 
It's been raining so everything is exploding in green. It's yummy.
Instead of being lazy and just turning on the internet radio I actually am listening to MP3's that jimmy burnt for me from our old computer.

Laura got me a book at a thrift store, it was a memoir of someones childhood in Alaska and I approached it with dread because that is my idea! But it was set in the 1940's, in Nome (treeless and arctic), and the girl moved there from San Fran at the age of 11, so it's totally different. I was glad. I think I am more interesting anyway. She spends too much time describing the scenery. Yeah, I get it, it was flat and cold and treeless but if you look hard enough you could see some flowers. Got ya.

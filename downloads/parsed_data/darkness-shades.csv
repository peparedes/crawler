"event","I found out today I don't have to take finals.  I've been studying really hard, so I wouldn't have to take my final in Pre-Calculus.  I got to see my new baby cousin today, I was so excited.  He's the cutest new born I've ever seen in my life.  He looks a lot like his little sister when she was that age.  We were comparing her photo to him tonight.  He really does look a lot like her.  And he has the smallest hands, but his fingers are so long.  He's got a full head of hair and his feet are HUGE.  For once, I just wanted to post something good in a message in a journal.  Even if it was something small, but now here comes the truth behind my post.  While I was at my cousin's seeing my new baby cousin.  My Aunt Helen calls mom on her cell.  Telling mom that my Great Grandma Simmons is in a nursing home, has been for 2 years, and that she's dieing and most likely won't live through tonight.  She'd be a hundred and two this June.  And her life has been filled with so many memories.  She's lived through so many advancements.  She's lived through WWII, Vietnam, Women's Right's Movement, Internet, TV, and even the Telephone.  So much has happened in her life, and now she no longer can share that with anyone.  She's dieing from Pnuemonia in one of her lungs, congestive heart failure, her breathing is labored, and her kidneys are shutting down.  They're giving her morphine for the pain, but since there's so much wrong with her and she's so old, they really can't do anything for her.  She'd die soon anyways, so they're letting nature take it's course.  They say she's not going to make it through the night, and I'm so angry, because I don't even get to say goodbye.  She's going to die tonight, and I can't go up and see her, because the car broke down.  I'm going to be lucky if I can even make it up there to the funeral.  They say that when bad things happen, they happen in pairs, but c'mon?  Two deaths in two months, that's kind of cruel.  I don't know if I can handle all of this strain, stress, greif...Where's life?  All of this is hell, I'm living hell now, but what happened to my life?  I miss grams...I haven't seen her in such a long time....and with that I need to close, the tears are making it so I can't read anymore...please...if you're reading this, be tender to me...to the ones you love...and to those who you see everyday.  You'll never know when they'll leave you...forever..."

"event","My day wasn't too bad, which has been a turn from the last few days.  It was less stressful.  It was so boring today, that I almost fell asleep in Government and Sociology.  That could be, because Trevor kept me up on the phone until 2 a.m.  He wouldn't let me hang up.  I guess I can't complain, after all he is a close friend.  We had conversations on the wierdest subjects.  Anyways, I digress.  Today was pretty good, specially at bowling practice.  We just joked around and had fun.  I bowled pretty well, then at the bowling meet afterwards my team one all four games, the typical three games and series.  Which brings us in 4th for the whole league standings.  Then afterwards Steve, told me that he was interested in a girl by the name of Emma.  He thought she was nice and pretty, which made me so happy, because now that means that he'll be seeing her from now on and not stalking me.  I'm excited, but that also makes me happy because it's not going to ruin my friendship with him.  *smiles*  Anyways, I guess things are starting to ease up.  Which I'm very happy for, I didn't know how much more stress I could take."

"event","Damnit, what the hell is with everyone taking everything I say wrong?  I'll say something and they perverse it and then flip it around on me and say that I'm some slut, or act like I'm one.  I'm fucking sick of it.  I'm sick of being lonely, sick of being depressed all the time, sick of bitching about something all the time, and I'm goddamn tired of dumbass people who don't give a shit whether you get ahead in this world.  I'm sick of friends who honest to god don't give a damn, and I'm tired of sitting in class after class, just existing, doing homework and not getting shit for it.  Fuck the world, fuck homework, fuck school, and fuck you!  *Glaring with steam coming out my nose*"

"event","I really hate school.  I go and I do homework all day to keep my mind off things, but while I'm there and I try to talk to people.  It's like they don't even listen to me.  I try to tell a joke, or simply strike up a conversation and it's like they either ignore me, or they take what I say wrong and then yell at me.  Then again, I could be talking about stuff in the wrong context.  Who knows?  Anyways, mom got me an appointment with a counselor at the Hamilton Center here in town Dec. 12, how exciting?  Well, the purpose of it is greif counseling.  Mom doesn't think that I'm taking grandpa's death well.  Which I guess I agree with.   After all today, on the way home from school on the bus some old man almost walked in front of the bus and grandpa's face shot up on the guys face and I pictured grandpa getting ran over by the bus.  I cried.  It's horrible, and last night I had this horrible dream about grandpa laying in the bed and suddenly waking up while they took the respirator off of him.  Then weeks later I start getting sick the same way he had, and I get placed in the same room as him only I'm not on a respirator, just oxygen.  And all of my friends are there and one of the people most important in my life.  Who lives no where near me, wasn't there.  And then when he comes up the elevator and in my room they kick him out, because they don't know who he is and they say he shouldn't be visiting.  Then he goes away, and I never see him again.  Shortly after I'm in the lobby crying my eyes out because I'll be dieing from leukemia soon.  I woke up sweating and freaking out, and it was like 4:30 in the morning."

"event","Well, since my grandfather died, I've really hated staying alone in this house.  Considering he died in it, and I really don't want to be left alone anyways.  Especially, if you're where that person died.  It makes me think of him more, and then it just sort of creeps me out.  Mom promised me that she'd wake me up before she went to this party for her friend's kid or whatever, and she said I could either go with her to the party or I could call and see if someone would come stay with me or I could go out and do something.  Well, she left and didn't wake me up.  So, I'm stuck in this house all day without a car to go anywhere and I'm extremely upset.  I can't get ahold of any of my friends so they can come over or come get me, so I really have no choice.  But, it upsets me that my mother would do something like that to me.  She knows how it upsets me.  I honestly don't know what I'm going to do.  *Sighing*  I mean, it's like no one has any respect for anyone's feelings anymore.  Not even family.  I feel like I'm being punished by someone, because all of this really bad crap is happening to me.  I never did anything to anyone.  All of this just upsets me more and makes me feel more depressed then what I already am.  I already have to go to a stupid grief counselor, because mom says I'm not handling this all well.  *shrugs*  I don't see why she cares, because she obviously doesn't right now!  And I'm sorry that I'm sitting here complaining, I know that it's selfish, but it gets me calmed down.  It's the way I deal with things.  But, I really shouldn't bitch anyways, because I mean, maybe she was in a hurry or something.  In that case she should've wrote me a note or soemthing.  And I'm really worried, because I can't get ahold of her and I called her cell and everything."

"event","I lost my grandfather 2 weeks ago, as of tomorrow.  He died from an aneurysm in his heart, a heart attack, and several various seizures that he had before he stopped breathing and then again after they brought him back.  When they put him on the respirator, they declared him brain dead the next day.  They said that the only thing functioning within his brain was his brain stem.  It pretty much regulates the body processes.  Keeping your heart beating, and your breathing regulated, and then the rest of your organs running.  After 2 days of being in the hospital, they took the respirator off, and he died 3 and a half hours later.  My uncle Danny, uncle Jerry, Aunt Karen, my cousin Jerry Dale, my mom, and I were all there when he passed away.  I essentially lost it when he stopped breathing, I screamed ""He's not breathing, he's not breathing.""  Then I started freaking out so bad I had to walk out of the room to catch my breath, by the time I got to the lobby I was freaking out worse and I collapsed on the floor racked by tears.  I was really close to my grandfather, and to go through this is absolutely horrible.  Though, I know he's dead and that I cried when he passed and while he was in the hospital, it's still not sticking that he's gone.  To me it's like he just went back for another visit to West Virginia, and me and mom are looking after the house while he's gone.  My cousin Dana went into labor Friday morning at 3:00 a.m.  They said that the contractions weren't close enough together, and that her water hadn't fully broken.  So, they sent her home and said that she'd be having the baby sometime before the weekend was over and that she was supposed to rest.  Last night I went to an all night-er with my youth group.  I had a blast.  I got to see my old friends from camp, and I got to meet new people and make new friends.  I have a lot of pictures from the lock-in.  So, if you'd like to see them let me know.  I also took some really funny videos.  Then, tonight, mom came in here and woke me up yelling that Damian and his grandpa's friends child were riding the four wheeler.  Someone dropped a gun, (not sure if it's toy or not) and he got off the four wheeler to pick it up.  The kid left on the four wheeler was three, and he ran Damian over with the four wheeler.  An ambulance came and picked him up.  He has a hairline fracture in his collarbone and his head, and he has a few more things wrong with him that I can't remember.  Then, through the basis of the week, I've been hearing about an old grade school friend of mine that I'm really close to.  Some really bad things have been happening to her.  Her mom had originally kicked her out of the house, because she was lesbian.  So, her grandmother took her in and asked her to just pay 6 dollars as rent.  After a while she got mad and said she wasn't going to do it.  So, her grandmother kicked her out and she began living with a friend in Bridgeton.  Well, they put her on Colonopin and Zoloft, for depression and some other things and supposedly they were interacting with each other and causing her to go into Anxiety attacks and seizures.  Well, the doctor said it was also due to her energy, she was getting too much caffeine in her diet and it was messing the medicines up and causing her to do that.  So, they told her not to eat, drink, or consume anything with large amounts of caffeine in it.  So, what does she do?  She takes an energy pill so that she can cause herself to go into a seizure, possibly a heart attack.  Since everyone has been throwing her out and all that, she feels no one loves her and she said she doesn't want to live.  She said hopefully, she'll have a heart attack one of these times and die, then no one would have to worry about wasting their time and love on her.  I feel really bad, because she's always been here for me when I needed her, and now I want to be there for her, but I don't know what in the slightest to do."

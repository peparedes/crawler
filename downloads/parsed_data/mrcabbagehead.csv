"event","My 1st order went ok considering everything and the prices. Vic HP ( before price increase) and lorazpam 2 mg. Cheapest shipping used.

Well, to be careful and not order a related med , which I did because it is very hard not too. Well, we did need some anti-pyschoic meds at these prices. ONCE IN A LIFETIME, It was sequail by the way. So my Vs (yes I went for the 270).IMO, it should not been set up to be ordered that way in the 1st place, and after realizating the error, a grandfather cause should have been put in place and forced by a PM method for those only involved. NOW we are called DDs and worst but if that table had been turned. Everyone not grandfathered would be cying foul. Hope my Zyzone will arrive too, in 30 days if needed to be legal. Now my Phenterine 37.5 ( yes 180) at my weight (396-408 lbs) depending on how stressed I am. I am getting stressed over this now so mama cooked bacon(5 for me), grits with a heaping tablespoon of butter, hash browns from the freezer(1 pk. only). Our healthy veggie for today.

So if I had my 2nd order in complete, grandma would not be able to cook after taking her daily dose of Vs plus a few extra. I would not have to drink for the pain in my knees,legs due to my excess size and could have taken a zydone for the pain. And mainly, help control my obese problem by taking the phenterine I need to control my eating problem. Yes, a start/ beginning to a new healther me , less pain, less sressful life which has been denied me again. Which just caused medicare/medicard system to pay 200% + for a visit to the ER because I got a bad case of gas which I though was a possible heart attack. This happens 20+ times in every ER and I am worried about medicare running out of $ for everyone , not just my big lazy farting butt. I have to use a cane to walk due to my size. Thank goodness for wheelchairs. I am hoping for my power chair will be approved soon(not a penny from me) , if the d**** motor does't blow or if I can get in there largest model. I think I can squeeze my cheeks in there with baby oil, my daily nurse reccomnded. The govenment pays her bill also.

BIG BOY (watch out for a overlarge guy in a moterized wheelchair squeezed in by baby oil, and having a hard time controlling the chair with that baby oil on the joysick. Goodness help me if I lost control of that sucker on a hill and have NO way to bale out or jump out and wearing nothing but a towel over my private area. Mercy help us and me if that thing turns over or hits a handicapp rail at top speed of 5 mph It could take a while to get me out of the chair if it turned overed on me and, bacisilly I will butt naked for all the neibors(sp)to see me stuck in a my new powerwheel chair. And nothing but a baby oil soaked towel to cover me. How embrassing then anohter trip to the ER by Ambalance.I am sure they will be glad to see me again at the ER. Well, I am generally a happy XXX large man with a generally overall good self-image about myself.

"event","This disease is getting worse.  Today, I awoke and had to fart urgently.  I pushed to force the warm gas through my fecal discharge opening.  I was horrified when the liquified remains of some unknown internal organs discharged.

I cannot move and have been wallowing in the filthy stench of my own necrosis.

The only comfort I have is the soothing flavor of Marlboro Country.

Imagine an old cardboard box that has been wet.  They smell terribly.  The box is sitting in the middle of a desert.  Nothing but sand and sun as far as the eye can see.  Not even the slightest hint of a breeze.  Suddenly a bomb detonates inside the box.

And so I am.

"event","Today I was visited by two aliens.  They said their society had solved all medical problems and they had come to give me this valuable information so that our world could benefit from it.  Unfortunately, they both died of some strange Earth disease before they could give me anything.

I'm not feeling so well.

Check back as I will keep you updated on my progress in this strange new world I have been born into!

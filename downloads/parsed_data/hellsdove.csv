"event","After running into the lovely Carol at the bead store, and being gently reminded that I have not posted or given a hint as to my existence since the whole Corey drama situation. Which has resolved itself. I have him happily within claws reach. Anyway...you would think after being gone for this long that I would have more to tell you guys, but sadly, it is all work and school and work and school. And an occasional mishap at either work or school, many times both. I'm sitting in the Lane computer lab, desperately searching for another class to enroll in so I don't have to take this Literature and Gender class. Sounds neat right? Ohhh soooo wrong. It wouldn't be a big problem if I didn't need this class to fulfill a specific requirement and my schedule is tight. Stupid professor and his ""public speaking is a wonderful way to learn this subject"" what a crock. there is nothing else in this world that makes me as insanely stupid as public speaking. In fact, the last time I had to make a speech in public, I threw up in a plant about five minutes before going on  stage. It is my one huge fault. Especially when you know that the classroom full of people doesn't give a rats ass about what you are saying. It's like being humiliated in vain. Anyway...enough of that rant. I've made a promise to Carol that I will keep in touch and possibly stop by more often. Yeeeee! I miss their house, even the toe licking puppies. 
Gotta run...integral calculus calls.

"event","I'm going to apologize in advance for the whiny selfish nature of this post...especially since its been a long time since I've posted to begin with

So...because of numerous threats of bodily harm to update my journal...here I am...amazing what can happen in a few months...
Last time most people heard from me before I dropped off the face of the earth Corey had moved up from California to be with me, there was an engagement ahhhh well, the best laid plans. So much for that. Although Corey had a job when he moved up here after a few weeks he started getting less and less hours and eventually they just stopped calling. He gets laid off and in the process his self confidence is shot to hell. Poor guy. For many of you who do not know Core, hes the greatest guy in the world but very much a glass is half empty type person. Just who he is. Anyway...after a month or so of half assed job searching, he springs on me that he is unhappy in Eugene for various reasons and wants to break up and move back to California. 

I flip, quite naturally. Considering nothing is wrong with US as a couple so why fix something that isn't broken so to speak.  We make a compromise that he gives it some more time and we'll talk about it then...so a month passes and he gets a good paying job that he ends up hating because his boss is a gambling addict with a bit of a bad attitude towards just about everything, mostly the female species among other things. Anyway...he quits his job and decides to go back to California for some time to clear his head about being engaged and just being in a relationship in general, and whether he wants to move back in a few months. I eventually agree after much discussion that its better he give it a try than staying in Eugene and possibly resenting me for being tied to a life that he doesn't want. So...Wednesday he packs his stuff up and we make the grueling 8 hour drive back to Wheatland, CA, with me bawling the last two hours of the drive...I drop him at his parents house, make him go inside because I simply can't drive off with him standing there...manage to drive myself to the pay phone around the corner and call my dad. Which was a life saver..I eventually got myself under control after a half an hour and drive the 11 hours back to Beaverton overnight. Not fun.  

Thursday morning, after rolling into town at 6:30 in the morning,  when I wake up  in my childhood bedroom, with my golden retriever sleeping on my legs and a cat wrapped around my neck, I stumble to check my email where I have a wrenching note from Corey only a few hours I left saying he feels sick about his decision not sure he made the correct choice in going back there even temporarily. That it doesn't feel right being there, he's confused, and will most likely be coming back to Eugene shortly etc etc. My first reaction to this is anger, after driving for almost 20 hours, going through the worst emotional experience of my life, only for him to change his mind four hours after I leave. I hadn't even gotten out of California when he has this epiphany. Frankly I'm just grouchy and feeling a little used and extremely abandoned. However...after a year and a half of speaking with him everyday for several hours a day...I'm not cut off completely from speaking with him other than a few quick instant messages. I feel like a junkie going through withdrawls. How sad...I've essentially forgotten how to simply be alone.  He decided while he was here and speaking with his friends back home that they would make a trip to Reno since he missed his friends birthday trip to Reno...he left tonight...barely 48 hours after I left him in California. Strke two...hes partying with friends while I'm sitting in my apartment lonely with no one to talk to but myself. Not a real healthy habit, although I indulge myself from time to time. 

So here I sit...after work I rented a few movies that Corey would never like and return home having to pee really badly realizing I've locked myself out of my apartment. Fantastic...so I drive to a phone and interrupt my landlords Peaknuckle game, assuming thats how you spell it. Get a key return home and wander around the apartment in my underwear eating lemon sorbet and pacing. Phone rings..my roomate James is moving the rest of his stuff in tonight..and the movie I'm watching can't keep my interest mainly because is has subtitles that are distracting me when I can understand half of the German they are speaking. Bleh...

Anyway...I'll quit whining now and most likely feed my fish and go to bed...such an eventful friday night...pout..would really like to get out of the house but have a complete lack of someplace to go...pout again...

Goodnight world...pout"

"event","Wow what a slacker I've been lately...well at least on the LJ front
Been an absolutely insane past few weeks...have hit a really rough patch with my dad of all people he has quite the list of issues involving me moving out...and made me feel irresponsible, selfish and slutty all in one conversation. Gotta love parents, fortunately enough my mom and extended family are being as sweet as humanly possible. Especially after weeks and months of crappiness between jobs, and apartments things finally started to fall into place. I got a job at a retirement facitiity as a waitress, we were approved for an fairly nice and inexpensive apartment with a very cool landlord ( he says we can paint the place any way we want so long as its back to white when we move out) Anyone want to help me with some murals :) We'll see though...but got my new phone number taken care of etc, and just have electricity deposit to do and all is done and I can move in on the 10th of June!!!!!!!!! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...anybody who wants my new information (address and phone etc) just need to ask. Have to figure out some way to transfer my stuff from here to there with no car...hmmm. We shall see. 
But other than that Corey was here for a few interview and had the week from hell last week, where everything was due on the same day and I seriously considered moving to Mongolia, possibly Tibet. My cousin Matt the shining star of the family made it home from Iraq two days ago...I watched his air craft carrier come into San Diego all on video phone and admitedly cried like a baby. So glad to have him back...don't tell the others but he's my favorite. He and his fiance are thinking about getting married sometime in the spring, which made me think about creative ways to tell my parents corey and I are engaged. Oh yeah...this should be interesting. Any ideas anyone? 

On a sadder note...<lj user=""miladycarol"">'s puppy Morgana had nasty surgery today so send lots of good karma and love thattaway. She deserves it...So that would be all...much love to everyone"

"event","Okay I just realized I forgot to fill in these questions...I must have gotten distracted by a bright shiny object or something...I swear when I'm in a bad mood I have the attention span of a bag of hammers.

Go to thisdayinmusic.com, plug in your 13th birthday, and find out what song was #1 on the US chart that week. (Or, the UK chart, if you're in Europe) If you recognize the song, what memories does it evoke? July 15th 1996, California Love by 2Pac...I really really hated that song and its stupid Mad Max'd themed video...just one more reason to add to why being a teenager sucked so much
Do the same for your 16th birthday, Heheheh Livin la vida Loca by Ricky Martin..weeeeeeeeeeeeee Haha I still love this song and think Ricky Martin is one sexy man, regardless of what ""team he plays for"" I remember a whole lot more people started signing up in the dance studio I worked in for salsa and samba lessons. Wanting to shake their butt like that chick in the video...hehehe people are funny. 
Do the same for your 18th birthday, if you've passed it. U Remind me by Usher...just still don't like that song...and thikn he needs to invest in a belt so he can keep his pants on in his concerts. :D 


What CD are you currently listening to, or did you last listen to? Is it from a genre you listened to as a teenager? (If you're still a teenager, would you have listened to it three, four years ago?)  Lonestar - Lonely Grill...lets see this came out about 3 or 4 years ago so I guess its still counts...still a great CD...everything changes in particular."

"event","Been just a nutty as all hell week...and really glad its over...even this night isn't going like I want it to. Parents went back on their agreement to sign a co-sign agreement for our apartment so now I'm scrambling to get a co-signer back to the property management company by Monday like I promised. Car broke down on Monday afternoon, I missed my lab class and now don't understand what I'm doing when mixing those toxic chemicals in lab. Then...yeah...just bombed, failed, got massacred on my chemistry test because Dr. Williams is a sadistic ass..no one in that class even got to finish the test. Some guy just walked out when he got the test. I wanted to yell after him 'Comrade!"" But I'm a wimp. I just felt the  urge to yack in the nearest garbage can. But I'm going to try not to worry about it and just hope for the best. Oy vey...
but I've been having all these longings for the really great sunday dinners my family that I used to have...where there is just some fabulous music on the stereo and everyone is happy. I really miss those days. I guess I keep going home hoping one will end up like that. Dad and I dancing in the living room, Mom singing in the kitchen and kitties and dogs running around everywhere. Sigh... I miss that..and wasn't only a few months ago. But oh well...just have to start making new memories in my new place (crosses fingers and toes that I get this place) It was really the one place I looked at I could really see myself living in and just letting loose. Great natural light, hardwood floors and lots of open space. Not necessarily a large apartment but definitely is a nice layout so you don't feel secluded from people just because you need to go into the kitchen...because it allllll flows. Guess its the Feng shui instinct in everyone. Definitely has some good vibes. And I love places that just have that good energy...kinda like Carol and georges place. Just feels good when you walk in the door. But anyway...I'm going to make amends with my boyfriend after being a teary headcase the past few days and hope he hasn't changed his mind about marrying me ;) 
Night everyone...

My daddys and my song:
Dreams go by - Harry Chapin  (highly recoomend this song to anyone whos never heard it)

There you stand in your dungarees
Looking all grown up and so very pleased
When you write your poems they have so much to say
When you speak your dreams it takes my breath away

You know I want to be a ball player
A regular slugging fool
But both our dreams must wait awhile
Until we finish school

And so you and I
We'll watch our years go by
We'll watch our sweet dreams fly
Far away, but maybe someday

I don't know when
But we will dream again
And we'll be happy then
Till our time just drifts away

There you stand in your wedding dress
You're so beautiful that I must confess
I'm so proud you have chosen me
When a doctor is what you want to be

You know I want to be a painter, girl
A real artistic snob
But I guess we'll have our children first
You'll make a home, I'll get a job

Listen to the seasons passing
Listen to the wind blow
Listen to the children laughing
Where do broken dreams go?

There you stand in your tailored suit
So many years gone by, but your're still so cute
We take the car to go and meet the bus
When our grandchildren come to visit us

You say you should have been a ballerina, babe
There are songs I should have sung
But I guess our dreams have come and gone
You gotta dream when you are young

And so you and I
We'll watch our years go by
We'll watch our sweet dreams fly
Far away, but maybe someday

I don't know when
But we will dream again
And we'll be happy then
Till our time just drifts away"

Your greatest need is to talk. If your date is not a good listener, you have trouble relating. A person must be intellectually stimulating or you are not interested sexually. You need a friend for a lover and a companion for a bedmate. You hate disharmony and disruption, but you do enjoy a good argument once in a while it seems to stir things up. You flirt a lot, for the challenge is more important than the sexual act for you, but once you give your heart away, you are uncompromisingly loyal. When you don't have a good lover to fall asleep with, you will fall asleep with a good book. (Sometimes, in fact, you prefer a good book.)

"event","Okay...so I'm in a bit of a ranting mood after what I saw this afternoon...on with the soapbox
So...on my home from bombing my calculus exam regardless of countless of hours of studying, anyway... I am still in a good mood because the sun is out and I'm trying to keep a positive attitude regardless of what just happened. And I see the back of a man holding up a huge sign, guessing that it was simply another religious group on campus I payed no mind until...I look down at a sign that says: ""Warning graphic pictures ahead"" and as I glace up I am face to face with a 8 feet tall color poster of an aborted babies head, or rather what is left of it. I consider myself to have a stomach of iron and can take on situations that would make most people gag. But I could feel my stomach doing somersaults when I saw this. Not from the actual image, although completely grotesque but for the absolute audacity these people have to use shock value and horrific pictures to get across their opinions, when there are so many better ways to do this. Without making half of the university turn green. Among their extremely bad taste they, this just pounds home the point that these people are completely out of their minds. They also had posters of victims from the Holocaust, calling the ""Abortion Revolution"" ""Americas Holocaust"" and comparing clinic doctors to Hitler. I don't have to tell anyone that Hitler and his regime were a group of meglomaniacs. I'm from almost entirely German descent and lived in Germany for 3 years of my life. I even have members of my family who were members of the Gestapo, and inheireted a box of Nazi memorabilia from a great uncle who I never knew. The box now sits in a storage facility until I decide what to do with it. But anyway...my point...Hitlers annihalted over seven million innocents based on religious beliefs. The idea that these protestors or demostraters, whichever they want to be called, should probably brush up on their history and the reasons behind it before they start making comparisons like that. 
And...another thing, I'm a firm believer in people exercising their right to freedom of expression, even when I think they are crazier than bedbugs. However, I don't think anyone should be forced to listen or view thier opinions if they do not want to. And with how this was set up there is virtually no way any student can walk to class without walking past these half a dozen or so 8 by 6 posters. So unless you closed your eyes and prayed that your feet would guide you to class without getting hit by a car you had no choice but to look at these displays. That is simply unfair, no one should have to look at this unless they choose to, I've seen pictures from abortions and have even gone with friends to recieve abortions because of medical reasons. And I agree wholeheartedly that it is not a pleasant process, the noises smells and sights are forever burned into my mind. Yet, even being right in the front lines, walking through protestors at abortion clinics to hold friends hands as they went through this process, I still remain a firm believer in pro choice. I'm all for people having children when they are ready, I plan to have a few rug rats of my own one of these days, and I also support women faced with the decision for personal, medical or religious convictions. You have my full hearted respect and blessing  with any decision made regardless of whether or not I agree with you.  So I guess my point in saying that is screw you people you're not going to change my mind, if anything you solidified my belief system that much more...so thanks for that.  
Also...one of the signs other than the aborted child, holocaust and baby killer posters also bothered me...It had once again a picture of an aborted baby with the caption ""God Bless America?"" I have never been in my life a patriotic person, I have a laundry list of things I think are wrong with this place, but I have a even longer list of why this is the best damned place in the world to live. Because only in America can crazy fucks like you do sick things like this legally, and only here can I tell you I'll see you in hell when you waive your pamphlets in my face and call me a baby killer. But sadly you forgot on top of a baby killer I'm also a tree hugging, dirt worshipping, cute fuzzy bunny petting liberal 19 year old who is only disgusted by your displays of ignorance and desperation, and not altered in any way than to really feel sorry for you. So that is all you get..my disgust and pity.
And lastly...to the woman who had her 8 year old son holding one of these god awful signs, and tried to hand me a pamphlet on anti abortion, when I politely refused with a ""no thank you"" you called me a ""baby killer"" do not think that I didn't hear you as I breezed past, but I tell you now, that I hope you heard my response of ""facist bitch"" flung back at you. I believe the only reason I didn't engage myself if a full blown altercation was one, the presence of the police and my complete lack of desire to waste my precious time on someone with such a narrowminded view of the world. Also...I don't feel the need to make an ass of myself in public by arguing with you, you're already making an ass of yourself enough for a dozen people. And don't you dare try and make me or anyone else feel guilty for any decisions they make in their life. I think you've already proved to approximately ten thousand people today that you don't deserve an iota of respect for showing pictures of someones aborted baby. That used to be someone's child for god sakes, and this demostration using these pictures is, simply put, a disgusting act of disrespect. And for that, makes you morally devoid, horrible excuse for a forgiving and gracious human being. 

Alright...just had to get that off my chest before I exploded with pure rage....sorry if I offended someone in this process, I'm not irritated about their protests..they have every right to voice their opinions. But the manner in which it was presented is absolutely horrific and disrespecful to all who are forced to view it.
You can send me your opinions if you wish...positive, negative, indifferent...I'll get down off my soapbox now...its been a fun ride."

"event","Ahh yes...I'm back..and using LJ as a tool of procrastination once again...my procrastination level has reached new limits today. Already planned out the fabulous Italian dinner Corey and I are cooking for my daddy's very merry unbirthday celebration (he stopped counting birthdays after he hit 50...which I believe was over 8 years ago) next weekend. I'm making chicken and eggplant parmesean with tiramisu. Corey is doing homemade pasta and making some sort of ravioli. Speaking of food...so yesterday night after I did some homework I was rewarding myself with a frozen lemonde from Minute Maid and after I got about halfway through...I found..a fly frozen to the inside of the container. I was highly grossed out. I mean I'm a nature girl, have licked slugs kissed frogs and hugged trees, but I think I reached my limit when I found a fly in my ice cream. Bleck.
Anyway...life has been super crazy...had an absolutely faboo dinner with Marc and his mommy on friday night, she gave me some nifty advice about alternatives to the career I want to persue. Nice lady, very cool...and did the typical mom thing of embarassing the hell out of poor marc. But he was a good sport and I have flan still sitting in my fridge waiting for me to devour it...mmmmmm flan. 
But have a calculus midterm on monday and have come to the obvious conclusion that I think I'm screwed. I like my prof and all but hes just not a very good teacher and kind of looks like my dead grandfather which is creepy nonetheless. 
And....had an experience of the ex boyfriend kind this week...many times this week really...SOB was slithering all over campus. He's a speech and debate coach for a high school in Portland and the finals for the state were being held at the EMU on campus. Yipee...in my attempts to be civil to him he made the charming comment that my boobs had gotten smaller and I looked like I was retaining water. Ugh...what an ass. But he is thankfully gone and I with any luck will never have to see him as long as I live. But something tells me I won't be that lucky. Le sigh. 
Anyway...off to see the bestest lab TA in the whole wide world and Canada. Matt!!! Weeeeee
Happy Sunday everyone! *mwah*"

I.e. Both of their air craft carriers left the gulf this morning and bringing them back to me. Matt being my favorite cousin in the whole wide world and Canada...Jordan being a big brother type of mine. Both of them safe and happy to be coming home....thank god.

Yeah...so I've been really bad about updating or even coming within five feet of my computer the past few weeks...
Probably doesn't help that corey was here from thursday to tuesday as well as my best guy Derek....weeeeeeeeeee.....Derek's whole family came to visit me and go to his sisters rowing meet out at Dexter Lake in Lowell....for having to arrive there at 6am on a Saturday its absolutely beautiful. But poor baby Derek got sick so Corey and I took him back to his hotel and then we went back to bed seeing as how we had stayed up the entire night before drinking margaritas and dancing in my shoe box of a room. Sigh...can't wait for him to move here so can be like that all the time.  Soooon...yay
And just as a really old update the whole sick thing kind of reached a pinnacle last week and I landed myself in the emergency room hooked up to an Albuterol system for a few hours...yipee But yeah....that was lots of fun. The doctor told me I had been having essentially a week long asthma attack brought on by bronchitis. Yayyyyyyyyy. But as of now...still doing fine but have to go home this weekend for Easter, because my Catholic grandmother layed the mother of all guilt trips on me to come home. grrrrr...the woman doesn't even like me. Why do I have to come home for a holiday that I don't even like. Well...I just told my dad there better be a monsterous chocolate bunny waiting for me when I got there. He assured me there would be and he would take me on a date out to dinner with my friend Sarah so he could catch up with his 'girls'. Note: Sarah is one of my best girlfriends, who my dad absolutely adores and wants to adopt, if it weren't for the fact that she is 20. 
But so...on top of Eater festivities in my grandparents cramped smelly house in smelly St. Helens, I get to go for bridesmaid dresses this weekend as well for Sarahs wedding. If I didn't love her so much I'd tell her to stuff it and I was wearing a potato sack for her wedding. 
Sigh...anyway...I better get studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow....*big heavy sigh and a whimper*
But I first should post the results of some random quiz I snagged from Carol.... you can take it here --> http://blanchard.virtualave.net/war/dndstats.html
Strength: 11
Intelligence: 18
Wisdom: 18
Dexterity: 17
Constitution: 15
Charisma: 18

Not actually sure what these numbers...but I think they have something to do with video game characters....hmmm oh well...ciao my loves!"

First last week they scare the shit out of me thinking I have that crazy SARS thing and practically come in with haz-mat suits on. Then they say oh...well you just have strep throat...oh well goooooody. Then I go back because I've got this wonderful fever of ooooohhh about 103. And they say...oh...looks like pneumonia. Gosh! That makes it so much better. But we're not going to do anything about it for you. Take a few aspirin and call us in the morning, here's your coat, don't let the door hit you on the way out. Think the doctor was looking forward to getting back to his sports illustrated swimsuit issue (*coughs* horrible old man)
 Soo...call my dad crying and generally just being a princess, because Corey has been dealing with it all weekend and its my dads turn to be the rational one. He lectures me about going to a real doctor...the kinds that have degrees hanging on the wall and such...so...now looking for a clinic that I can go to tonight or tomorrow afternoon before I croak. So now I'm scouring the yellow pages and find that just about everything but a general urgent care that will be open past five except some place thats like 25 miles away. Pout...I hate this school...I'm moving to Canada."

"event","I finally cracked under the pressure to update my journal so folks didn't thikn I had up and died. (again)

Spring Break was a bit of a bust, just worked a lot and only got to see my friends once *pout* Had my sister bring me back into town on sunday afternoon and we swapped equally juicy dirty family secrets. Was a bit of fun but now realizes why my mom and I don't have a very good relationship while my dad and I are attatched at the hip. But I digress....just have come to accept I will probably be in the need for therapy before I have any kids of my own ;)

End of the quarter damn near killed me and because I didn't do so hot on my biology cells final I managed to go from a solid A in the class to a D so now I have to con the biology office into letting me keep my class. Funnnnnn....I freaking dislike my biology prof from last term.. the guy I study with calls him the 'tricky bastard' which is ohh so true. But forgive and forget...take the class again...its a vicious cycle. And apparently I found out today my chemistry professor hates teaching chemistry and is slightly bitter about his placement in the department. Wonderful!!!! But other than that the other proffesors seem like genuinely nice people...my biology prof hit on me this morning, before he realized I was about to become one of his students. Ooops. But it made me happy nonetheless and life goes on. My calculus professor is just a little too excited about the world of math. His opening line this afternoon was: ""every time you get in your car its like driving a calculus machine!"" Oh goody! That makes driving so much more enjoyable. Hmmm not so much.

Only news was my sis got married to her dumb boyfriend of forever on the first saturday of spring break, I was the only one besides her dad (not my dad, half sister) on her side of the family to show up. My dad didn't go for a few reasons, well lots of reasons. He didn't want to run into melissa's real dad and my mom didn't go for the same reason. So I had to listen to Melissa's redneck father bad-mouth my mother in public because she had to work and didn't want to see the likes of him. Grrrrrrrrrr.  Just pissed me off, while he also said a few choice words about me behind my back while he thought I was out of range. In short, I'm a spoiled bitchy princess who likes to fuck around. Which is sort of funny since I've only seen the man max four times in my life and never said a word to him. Anyway...hes just a dumb hick. 

But other than that...not a whole lot is new, my friend James from high school is going to be moving in with Corey and I in the fall...so Corey and I will probably have the apartment (whichever one we find) to ourselves for the summer until James comes in the fall, but I'm excited for it to happen, James is a sweetie and really quiet so is a nice fit for my lifestyle, and doesn't seem to mind living with a couple so its alll good. 

Going to try and get in touch with Carol, George and Flex in the near future to hang out with them and catch up before they move ohh so far away, also made tentative plans to hang out with Marc this friday night see if I can round up Matthew as well but hes been well not around or not talking to me...or both..so we shall see. But yes...enough procrastinating, must start my homework...sigh...going to get alll A's this quarter! Well maybe not...we'll shoot for lots of high B's.

Got to go home for the weekend to visit my parental units, my girl Sarah and my sis...
Went wedding dress for Sarahs wedding...I lasted all of two hours before I was in white tafeta overload and had to leave...was lots of fun though...lots of bitchy brides and their mothers *Shudder*. Always just tons of fun. We had a fun lunch and browsed catalogs for the bridesmaid dresses which I will be in...yay. Bleck. All the planning just makes me want to get married in my backyard with my family and friends...thats it. None of this dropping ten grand on a wedding stuff, I'm just going to throw a party with everyone in their jeans. Yay for me.
More wedding talk...my sister, whos boyfriend is in the Navy in Florida at the moment. Got engaged this October, on the same day Corey proposed to me oddly enough. But anyway, dropped the bomb on my parents that when Christian (her boyfriend) comes home in a few weeks they are going to go get married. We'll see if they are organized enough to pull off a wedding with blood tests and Navy paperwork in a week. I don't know...I don't think I would want to get married and have my husband disappear two days later. Nor would I ever want to be a military wife. There are just some things I know I'm too big of a wimp to do. I personally like having my significant other around most of the time. 
But...on the other hand they have already been together longer than most marriages last (like 8 years or something like that) so we'll see I guess. wish I could go to her wedding but its right in the middle of my finals week...grrrrrrrr... so I wouldn't be able to go even if they do pull it off....damn. Sigh. 

Corey is here in TWO DAYS!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!  I've missed him more than normal this time...his timing is shitty as hell but I couldn't care less right now...he gets in sometime thursday night and I have a quiz and a test, and homework due as usual on Friday...ugh! Oh well...just have to bust ass to get it all done today and tomorrow...which I am off to do righhttttt NOW!
*Mwah* buh bye"

Here I am...procrastinating once again....

Corey is here in 8 days...thank god..I'm going bonkers, y'know, realizing that your personal sanity relies on someone else is not a comforting thought. But mine does just the same. 

Sometimes I wish I could just wake a magic wand and make all the bad things in life just disappear, my friends would have a lot less heartache and I would have thinner thighs. But I can't do that so when things are gloomy do as I do: Climb the highest mountain, stare into the heavens, breathe deeply and say, ""GIVE ME A !#*%(@ BREAK!!!""

So yeah...friends lives are falling apart around me and the University here is determined to send me to the psycho ward broke within the next year...crimeny. UofO just changed the requirements for my degree...I now also have to take a year of Computer Science classes and found out that the only schools that have my masters program have campuses in...get this: Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, Georgia, West Virginia or some god-awful expensive place in Conneticutt. So any way I look at the years after my bachelors I will be living amongst trailers and 13 year old mothers of three. Joy. Why must they have Forensics master programs in places where the residents can't even spell the name of the state they live in? Enough of my rant...

On the bright side of life (just had the insane urge to break into song after those words) I'm going home this weekend...my best friend is having her wedding sometime next summer, I get to be the maid of honor (weeeeeee) So shes doing the bitchy bride thing wanting me to come home and help her choose sites for their wedding. And get her to jump online occasionally and look for things on her own, presently shes merging onto the information superhighway at the speed of someone driving a Daewoo, carpooling to a weight watchers meeting.
Anyways...back to research papers....yay.

"event","Hey y'all's. If thats even a word....yeah I'm a total slacker...seems I only ever use this thing to complain or whine about something...probably starting to look like colossal bitchiness on my end of the rope. 
So updating....
I still have not talked to my dad since the whole phone bill thing blew up...I never thought there would be a day when I got along better with my mom than my dad...but it looks like that day is here...and the squirrel says weeeeeeeeeeeeee. 

The beach was absolutely awesome...but I stepped on a sea urchin and my feet were so frozen from playing on the beach at 11 o'clock at night that I didn't feel it until lots o' sand got in there. So we then decided to head back to the car because I was dripping sea water, stank like dead starfish most likely, and now had a gaping hole in my foot. Most excellent. So instead of hiking diagonally across the beach to where the car was we decided to walk straight up and cut over the grass to save my foot just a bit. All was well and good until we realized that halfway through the grass that it was an invariable swamp. And I was in flip flops...so every time I stepped in the six inch deep mud water I slapped a full metric ass load of mud up onto my butt. Sweet. So we eventually make it through the swamp with sensitive Corey making jokes about water mocassins in the water...something I'm nice and scared of. What a doll...anyway...we get to the car after I wring my pants out a bit and realize theres a shit load of mud on my ass. And I get a piggy back ride to the car... Where since I didn't think there was anybody in the beach parking lot (right below Heceta Head Lighthouse....muy muy bootiful at night...oy) so anyway. 

Since I was cold, and was smart before we left the hotel figuring that i would be getting wet, brought a sarong with me so I could change into before I sat my wet ass on Core's leather seats. Sooo...I strip out of my soaking pants and just as I'm bending over into the car to grab my sarong  a park ranger pulls into the parking lot and his headlights are right on my ass. Was wearing underwear of course but it wasn't exactly much to hide from unforgiving headlights from a Jeep. And so I dive into the backseat and scramble to cover my ass....while the ranger is looking at me verrrrrrry curiously, I smile sweetly and inconspicuously wrap the sarong around me while turning about seven shades of pink and red. End of saga. 

So home from the beach and Core and I go immediately to sleep...and just spend the rest of the day being lazy while I did some homework. Didn't go to classes because I was dying of cramps and was too exhausted to make it anywhere. But Corey left Tuesday, and was in lovely depression untillll...the sinus infection from hell set in and then was just cranky. And still am cranky. And to make matters better, Coreys going to Reno this weekend. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Like my favorite thing to do on a saturday night is to sit at home with a sinus infection since my freinds cancelled on me, while my roomies boyfriend comes into town. Lovely and a half. So thats the bitching and ranting for the week...aren't you thrilled...
Happy Friday y'all...catch you later. Pout."

Two chem assignments, a lab due, correcting my calc midterm, doing my calc homework, and the reading for my history class, the history class in which i will hopefully get my midterm back in...probably not that I want it but it will relieve the anticipation of the 'D' that I probably got.

So I get a call from my dad this morning and had a little premonition when it did that I shouldn't pick it up...but being the masochist that i am..did pick it up and immediately knew something was wrong. My dad is fuming on the other end, probably bright red with that vein sticking out of his forehead. And says to me...""I'm looking at a twenty thousand dollar phone bill"" My reaction of holy shit was not welll received, seeing as how he thinks I'm the one who did it. This credit phone card thingy...has been used by me once or twice to call Core in Wheatland, CA. Maximum ten times over the past two times for no more than ten minutes or so. And yet he thinks I've managed to literally spend every minute of my day racking up a phone bill over twenty grand. Go me. Too bad this is FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE. I don't quite get that part out because he hangs up on me. (FYI: I get livid when people do that to me) So I call him back, or try to. Before he picks up, I tell him that it has to be some sort of fluke because there is no way that is even physically possible for me to do that. He promptly hangs up on me again. What a bastard. That means something considering how close my dad and I are, but hes just a teensy bit irrational when he gets angry, and I get to be the lucky emotional punching bag. Yay and a half. 

Sooo...I call my ultra cool aunt to freak out at her, she already knows because she tried calling earlier to talk to my mom and my dad wouldn't let her talk to my mom because he was in his office, in a shitty mood and not willing to take the phone to my mom so she could talk to her sister, whom he dislikes greatly. She reassures me that this has to be some sort of massive mistake and to not sweat it. Riiiiiiiiiiight. Like thats going to happen. My father apparently hates me, and I can't even talk to my mom to get a second opinion. Lovely. But it gets better. I have my aunt tell my mom to call me the next time she talks to her because I'm not going to risk having another verbal run in with the silver tongued SOB. So my mom calls me this evening... who isextremely calm considering the circumstances, and that shes been a menopause case for the past few months and just in general a total hormonal head case. She doesn't seem to be able to grasp the idea that I don't have enough time in my day to spend twenty thousand dollars worth of long distance phone charges, but certainly wish I did. The only response I get is to 'get a grip' on myself until tomorrow. Because by this time, its about the fortieth time I've broken into hysterics. 

I tell her to shove getting a grip up her ass because she obviously doesn't realize what it feels like to be accused of this and 'getting a grip' is not...I repeat not..a viable reaction right now. So she says the necessary your father doesn't hate you...he's just angry..sure. Coming from the spouse's who never ever fight. Fuckin un-natural. 

And then...once again talk to the super cool aunt, after getting off of the phone with Corey...whos going to watch the All-Star Game at his retarded friends house. Fine. Just go is my response. This response should send up red flags to any man. Get off the phone with my aunt who is helping a little bit but still trying to get me to not worry about it. I just have to be a raging lunatic until someone tells me that duh...I didn't charge that much money to a freakin phone card. Especially when I have midterms tomorrow...had to miss the review session to wait for my mom to call. So am not exactly really capable of concentrating on more than how much I hate my life right now while being consequently abandoned by my boyfriend. 

Then...to make it even better. I get a very hasty IM from a probably fairly intoxicated Corey saying that he's just going to stay the night at Jeffs house and will be home tomorrow before my classes are done. Generally the man has enough sense to ask if this is okay that he be surrounded by Jeffs whorish bitches of friends, but no...just him typing ultra fast hoping he can probably sign off before I get out of bed with my book and make it to the computer. He wasn't so lucky and I wish I could have reached through the monitor and just decked him. Because the big freakin idiot knows this is possibly one of the worst days of my life and hes getting trashed at his friends house instead of staying with me. Yes I know, this is probably pretty selfish but not like I forbid him from going out and the one night I need a boyfriend or a friend of male persuasion to cry on, the guy disappears and will surface sometime tomorrrow while I'm working my asses off on my midterms, hungover and whining about how he doesn't feel good. Corey baby...I love you more than anything but blow it out your ass. 

AND then...to end my evening...I get an IM from my ex, probably my least favorite ex, but we remain friends somehow, he is whining about basketball and I tell him that its retarded to get all hot and bothered about something that you can't control. I really find it stupid to pay money to sit on uncomfortable bleachers to be frustrated. But thats just me. And he knows this...y'know what..here's the convo...short and nasty...may not seem that way but we are both holding in the temptation to start a bitch fight. Because thats what the ass clows is. A bitch. A receding hair-line, limp dicked (and yes thats a fact), beer bellied bitch. It's just that simple. That may seem like a bitter rage from an ex, but no...its simply the truth and if you want the story behind it, ask me anytime, I'm willing to share and its really very entertaining for all involved. Except maybe him.

EBeth83C (12:33:55 AM): I'm a fan and I don't think it is

At this point he signed off before I really let him have it. I instead left him a scathing message on the answering machine at his house. The one I know he never checks but his brother and rest of his family does. Mentioning all the above listed attributes and telling him if he ever came with 50 feet of me again that I would post his picture on the I-5 - I-217 interchange of his drunk ass running around naked at my graduation party (charming I know) which would accentuate very clearly; the previously mentioned of lack o' package. Vicious? Yes. Bitchy? Yep. Completely deserved? Hell fuckin yes. Karma's a bitch ain't it Colin? You fucked with the wrong girl today bucko. Its a really good thing I'm not armed. 

Well I think I'm going to get away from my computer before anything else goes wrong and go cry in the corner. Stupid me...I hate crying. Sigh. Pout. Why can't I hate my boyfriend for being stupid like everyone else? I think I need a hug. Or a drink. Well I'm not going to get either so I'm going to go cry like a wimp. Bye."

"event","Ahhhh what a week....Although I have massive amounts of work to do over the next few days...hmmm Lizbeth doesn't seem to care now because the sun is out, there are big puffy clouds and squirrels bouncing about merrily. Like freakin' Pleasantville around here. Except for the obvious addition of color. I want to go outside and lay in the sun to attempt to get some color. But its alll of twenty degrees outside and the grass has massive amounts of rain water. So unless I want a realllllly wet ass and permanent PNS (Pointy Nipple Syndrome) I will pass on the whole outside idea. Will settle on being a troll in my room, my favortie thing to do anyway. I'm such a homebody. 

Sigh...talked to my friend Joel this week for some ridiculous amount of time on the phone thursday night/friday morning, when I couldn't sleep and Corey was already in bed. He's so cute and sweet *laughs*. He will never see this so I can say stuff like that without him getting embarassed. If there is some fabulous single girl reading this...I have your man, his name his Joel and is a S-T-U-D. I even have pictures if ya want them. Sigh...so adorable, he makes me smile. 

On a not so cheerful note I bombed my chem test, sigh. I'm doomed when it comes to chemistry. It is the devil incarnate and I might as well just succumb to its power and sell my soul right now so I can pass that stupid class. Would be easier if I didn't love my chem professor so much either. Stupid Julie! Why must you be so nice?! Why can't I hate you because your class is so friggin hard?! Bah. 

Had an experience last night of the ex boyfriend kind. He somehow managed to bully it out of a friend of mine that Corey and I had a tiff. So his brilliant ass calls me at 3am to ""make sure I'm okay"". For someone who was such a phenomanally horrid boyfriend, who broke my heart, and crushed my spirit he sure is taking a lot of interest in my life now.  Stupid git probably knows more about me now than when we were together for almost a year. Feel really sorry for the next girl who falls for his charming ploy. (I tell you now sweetheart it only lasts until he knows he has his man claws in you). What a wanker. ( ""Wanker"" courtesy of my british boy Grayson)

Corey was here this weekend to save my sanity and remind me why I have the best fiance ever. Joy joy joy. So friday he got here sometime in the afternoon and we just hung out and waited for althea to leave so we could actually lay around naked like normal couples. I dunno, maybe I'm crazy but if given the choice I would just laze around under the covers with my man pillow watching Trading Spaces or something weird on TLC, than go out on a date persay. Oh well...just the Cancer coming out in me, I'm the epitomy of a homebody. But we checked out apartments (P.S. if anyone knows of some cheap apartments that aren't really ghetto puleeeeeeeze let me know) on saturday and part of sunday. He was supposed to leave on Moday afternoon but willpower lost to me being clingy and weepy so he stayed until this morning. I hate saying goodbye...just sucks so freakin much. Plus I hate crying in front of other people, especially when I look like a bloated tomato when I do cry. 

Anyways, now that hes gone its back to cold cruel reality and midterms....weeeeeeeeeeeeee. Ugh...fuck me this is not going to be fun...especially history, memorizing a gazillion planetary arrangments from dead white guys. Happy happy joy joy.

Too bad, its the truth. So there. 

Want to know what pisses me off? People who take normal relationships for granted. They don't ever take into account that there are some people who are actually happily in love but don't get to see that significant other whenever they want. For example: I can't just call Corey over to make me brownies..which I'm craving thanks to the period princess. (Betcha didn't want to know that either, once again...too freakin bad bucko) Like girls who don't use opportunities to see their boyfriends, because they would rather go to the mall to buy a hundred dollar pair of flip flops from J. Crew.

 I would give anything anything anything to be able to have that luxury of knowing Core was only five minutes away. But nooooooooooo he has to be 500 miles away, if I believed in God I would make sure to tell him what a vengeful bastard he/she/it is. Can't just send me the one thing I want and put him within a respectable distance, walking distance would be nice. Now my legs are in pretty faboo shape but my ass cannot walk to po-dunk California. Grrrrrrr. 

Anyway, I'm going to try and get to bed before I fall asleep on my desk. Always gives me a bitch of a kink in my neck. 

Core: Love you sweetie, can't wait to get to you. 

And for your viewing pleasure...the song I plan on falling asleep to. 

""Let Me Love You""

Sometimes I close my eyes 
And imagine you're with me 
Chasing passion into the night 
All tangled in a dream. 

Oh if you could see my heart 
The way I feel inside 
You would know just how far 
I'm willing to go to get to you 
There is nothing I won't do. 

Show me what its like to lose control 
Free the desire in your soul 
Oh oh let me love you. 

Let me take you to a place like no where else 
Show you the things you never felt 
Oh oh let me love you. 

Oh I want to taste your kiss 
Be the reason for your smile 
Touch the magic on your skin 
Be the one that drives you wild. 

Oh if you could read my mind 
You'd know you're everything I need 
You'd see yourself through my eyes 
You may understand what I'm going through 
Just how much I want you. 

Show me what its like to lose control 
Free the desire in your soul 
Oh oh let me love you. 

Let me take you to a place like no where else 
Show you the things you never felt 
Oh oh let me love you."

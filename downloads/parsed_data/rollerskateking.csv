I've been so very selfish reading all your thoughts, and all the while not leaving any of my own.  I haven't been a very good friend.  All you do is give and all i do is take.  well no more, for now.  i can't guarantee that i'm the same lovable oaf that you used to be friends with but i hope that all friends of the old jared will just grandfather in the new one.  If not i completely understand that it was my fault.  I hope that you can all forgive me.  Here's looking at you kids.

P.S. the first person to recommend an awesome book for me to read wins.  ready go."

"event","Alright i've been playing my cards pretty close to the chest these days.  I didn't want you to know what was kicking around in my head.  I guess this is my way of saying i'm sorry for not being there for you.  I guess i'm back... for now.  Today was stupid, but i refuse to come back after a long long time away and say how terrible my day was.  Instead i will say that i met a very nice lady the other day.  So that was neat.  I will even go as far as to tell you that i incurred a frolicking accident on the way back from said meeting.  I am a walking calamity.  Calamity Jane and i would get along.  Long story short my body has been sustaining lots of damage recently, and i have to say i am very durable.  It reminds me of this part from freak the mighty where freak is talking about how the knights were cyborgs, because they were metal to cover up the physical perameters of there bodies.  The kicker comes when you meet Killer Kane who little Max Kane says doesn't need armor.  He is a perfect killing machine.  I am that man.  That is to say i'm not a killer.  I'm just saying that i am damn near indestructible.  Is all.  This is all by way of saying that I am back, and i rule."

<lj-cut text=""my dream"">
TeamFatKid (4:44:20 AM): i had a crazy dream last night
Jared Kaufman (4:44:28 AM): me too.
Jared Kaufman (4:44:29 AM): you go first.
TeamFatKid (4:44:46 AM): basically i had to walk into your house to ask your dad if i could barrow his teleporter so i could make it to a location that is 12 hours away in 8 hours
TeamFatKid (4:44:54 AM): he said no
TeamFatKid (4:45:02 AM): for some reason he was in a bath towel
TeamFatKid (4:45:07 AM): then u julie and jessie walked in
TeamFatKid (4:45:18 AM): you were wearing a sleeveless stone cold steve austin shirt
TeamFatKid (4:45:22 AM): you shaved your beard
Jared Kaufman (4:45:24 AM): haha
TeamFatKid (4:45:29 AM): and cut your hair into a mullet
TeamFatKid (4:45:32 AM): it was awesome
TeamFatKid (4:45:39 AM): you looked fucking crazy
Jared Kaufman (4:45:40 AM): i hate rednecks.
TeamFatKid (4:45:48 AM): i woke up at that point laughing really hard
Jared Kaufman (4:45:57 AM): weird.
Jared Kaufman (4:46:01 AM): so be both had dreams about me.
TeamFatKid (4:46:13 AM): odd
Jared Kaufman (4:46:16 AM): alright this is a long one so pull up a chair.
Jared Kaufman (4:46:32 AM): dude this dream is up there with the dinosaurs that could turn into trees dream.
TeamFatKid (4:46:42 AM): wow
Jared Kaufman (4:46:49 AM): alright so to start off with i am a bit younger.
Jared Kaufman (4:46:52 AM): maybe 13.
Jared Kaufman (4:47:01 AM): i am riding on the outside of a UPS truck.
Jared Kaufman (4:47:07 AM): i can't find a comfortable position.
Jared Kaufman (4:47:12 AM): i keep thinking i'm going to fall off.
Jared Kaufman (4:47:19 AM): my dad is driving.
Jared Kaufman (4:47:35 AM): his numerous brothers were all in the cab.
Jared Kaufman (4:47:53 AM): he looked nothing like cary kaufman but in my dream he was my dad.
TeamFatKid (4:47:58 AM): ahh
Jared Kaufman (4:48:01 AM): also it is important to know i have no uncles on my dad's side.
TeamFatKid (4:48:06 AM): lol
Jared Kaufman (4:48:10 AM): alright here is where the dream gets strange.
Jared Kaufman (4:48:16 AM): we reach the house.
Jared Kaufman (4:48:22 AM): it is my old house in coral springs.
Jared Kaufman (4:48:30 AM): i'm in my room and i decide to go to sleep.
Jared Kaufman (4:48:47 AM): in my dream within the dream satan has chained me to the bed.
Jared Kaufman (4:48:58 AM): the problem is that it is also happening in the dream.
Jared Kaufman (4:49:02 AM): you follow?
Jared Kaufman (4:49:15 AM): so in the dream within the dream satan is chaining me to the bed.
TeamFatKid (4:49:26 AM): yeah
Jared Kaufman (4:49:36 AM): but i (asleep in the dream) realize it is also happening in real life (my dream).
TeamFatKid (4:49:42 AM): ok
Jared Kaufman (4:49:45 AM): so i pray to jesus to save me from satan.
Jared Kaufman (4:49:51 AM): and suddenly i wake up.
Jared Kaufman (4:49:54 AM): still in the dream.
TeamFatKid (4:49:58 AM): yeah
Jared Kaufman (4:50:00 AM): just wake up from the dream withing the dream.
Jared Kaufman (4:50:06 AM): and this dog is there.
Jared Kaufman (4:50:17 AM): it looks beaten and stuff but he is just laying at the foot of my bed.
Jared Kaufman (4:50:35 AM): he has a bunch of eyes going down his back in succession.
Jared Kaufman (4:50:39 AM): it is a mohawk of eyes.
Jared Kaufman (4:50:43 AM): i realize this dog is jesus.
Jared Kaufman (4:50:47 AM): so i start petting him.
Jared Kaufman (4:50:54 AM): so then my mom and dad in the dream come in.
Jared Kaufman (4:51:07 AM): i tell them what happened and they both get pissed off.
Jared Kaufman (4:51:16 AM): but you don't find out till later in the dream why.
Jared Kaufman (4:51:26 AM): ... this dream was so fucked up.
Jared Kaufman (4:51:40 AM): so because of my satan problems they realize that we need help as a family.
Jared Kaufman (4:51:49 AM): alright so we are in group therapy still in the house.
Jared Kaufman (4:51:57 AM): only the house is not just the little house anymore.
Jared Kaufman (4:52:03 AM): it has grown and become more sinister.
Jared Kaufman (4:52:09 AM): it has become a living breathing mansion.
Jared Kaufman (4:52:15 AM): follow?
TeamFatKid (4:52:20 AM): yes
Jared Kaufman (4:52:27 AM): alright so we are in group therapy.
Jared Kaufman (4:52:34 AM): this is where the shit hits the fan.
Jared Kaufman (4:52:51 AM): one of my mom's brothers says the wrong thing and it pisses off my dad.
Jared Kaufman (4:53:01 AM): he gets up and turns into a fucking wolf.
Jared Kaufman (4:53:12 AM): we find out in group therapy my dad is a werewolf.
TeamFatKid (4:53:18 AM): lol
Jared Kaufman (4:53:22 AM): atmosphere is everything at this point.
Jared Kaufman (4:53:26 AM): it is fucking creepy.
Jared Kaufman (4:53:32 AM): this place was sinister.
Jared Kaufman (4:53:41 AM): so at this point my mom's side of the family goes ape shit.
Jared Kaufman (4:53:45 AM): they start changing also.
Jared Kaufman (4:53:52 AM): turns out my mom's side of the family are all vampires.
Jared Kaufman (4:54:10 AM): my mom and dad did not know that the other one was a vampire and werewolf respectively.
Jared Kaufman (4:54:16 AM): they found out in group therapy.
Jared Kaufman (4:54:24 AM): this is why they were both pissed at satan.
Jared Kaufman (4:54:30 AM): anyway.
Jared Kaufman (4:54:39 AM): everyone in the room suddenly looks at me.
Jared Kaufman (4:55:10 AM): because apparently seeing my family become mythical creations triggers something in my dna.
Jared Kaufman (4:55:19 AM): keep in mind i am half vampire half werewolf.
Jared Kaufman (4:55:22 AM): so what do i become?
Jared Kaufman (4:55:24 AM): the answer.
Jared Kaufman (4:55:29 AM): a phoenix.
TeamFatKid (4:55:32 AM): lol
TeamFatKid (4:55:35 AM): fucking crazy man
Jared Kaufman (4:55:43 AM): dude i'm not even done.
Jared Kaufman (4:55:51 AM): so my body is changing.
Jared Kaufman (4:56:08 AM): my skin becomes orange and glowing and my wings poke out of my back.
Jared Kaufman (4:56:19 AM): everything on me is on fire but i'm not dying.
Jared Kaufman (4:56:30 AM): this is why satan was trying to kill me.
Jared Kaufman (4:56:37 AM): dude... in my dream satan fucking feared me.
TeamFatKid (4:56:47 AM): thats crazy man
Jared Kaufman (4:56:51 AM): my subconscious is so cocky.
TeamFatKid (4:57:10 AM): it really is
Jared Kaufman (4:57:13 AM): so anyway i come to terms with the fact that my mom is a vampire and my dad is a werewolf and we live in a sinister mansion.
Jared Kaufman (4:57:25 AM): relatives come from all over to live with us.
TeamFatKid (4:57:29 AM): lol
Jared Kaufman (4:57:43 AM): because i am now this savior of the world or something.
TeamFatKid (4:57:52 AM): lol
Jared Kaufman (4:57:53 AM): it was prophesied.
Jared Kaufman (4:58:16 AM): the phoenix son of a vampire werewolf would deliver the world.
TeamFatKid (4:58:21 AM): lol
Jared Kaufman (4:58:36 AM): so we are all living in this sinister mansion.
Jared Kaufman (4:58:48 AM): dude it looked like the castle from van helsing, i'm talking sinister.
Jared Kaufman (4:59:05 AM): so apparently some of my relatives are weaker vampires and werewolves.
TeamFatKid (4:59:06 AM): lol
Jared Kaufman (4:59:18 AM): but they can fit together like jigsaw puzzles.
Jared Kaufman (4:59:34 AM): and when twenty or so of these weak relatives fit together they can fly as one.
Jared Kaufman (4:59:42 AM): but my close relatives.
Jared Kaufman (4:59:49 AM): mom dad, uncles aunts...
Jared Kaufman (4:59:53 AM): can all fly on there own.
Jared Kaufman (5:00:01 AM): but they make fun of the jigsaw puzzle fliers.
Jared Kaufman (5:00:16 AM): then i turn into the phoenix again and tell them to unite.
Jared Kaufman (5:00:55 AM): i tell them now that the werewolves and vampires have united they are just trying to form two factions again.
Jared Kaufman (5:01:13 AM): i tell them that if this is so they will feel my wrath.
Jared Kaufman (5:01:20 AM): after this i float back down to the ground.
Jared Kaufman (5:01:33 AM): this girl is down there.
Jared Kaufman (5:01:36 AM): she is human.
Jared Kaufman (5:01:47 AM): apparently we started dating before she found out i was the phoenix.
Jared Kaufman (5:02:00 AM): so for her i decide to give it all up.
Jared Kaufman (5:02:12 AM): i remove this stake from an orb that symbolizes my power.
Jared Kaufman (5:02:15 AM): for her.
Jared Kaufman (5:02:18 AM): i then bury it.
Jared Kaufman (5:02:30 AM): we walk away from the castle holding hands.
Jared Kaufman (5:02:36 AM): and for some reason it was sunny again.
Jared Kaufman (5:02:45 AM): and there were kids our age all in bathing suits.
Jared Kaufman (5:02:54 AM): the end...
Jared Kaufman (5:02:55 AM): ?
Jared Kaufman (5:03:04 AM): you always have to throw in the question mark.
TeamFatKid (5:03:04 AM): wtf(exclamation point)
TeamFatKid (5:03:11 AM): thats crazy man
Jared Kaufman (5:03:18 AM): i woke up pissed off that i gave up being the phoenix.

I was watching the action from wherever the camera was placed but i was actually there... well not physically there... my body wasn't... i was just watching the stuff... i woke up wondering what the hell my subconscious was trying to tell me... should i start watching M*A*S*H everyday again?  anyway i am going to try to reproduce the incident.  Only this time i am going to try to watch an old episode of pete and pete.  Am i actually watching tv in my sleep?  Does that mean i'm good at watching T.V....  upon further inspection i might  just find out A. My imagination has been so warped by television that i can't have new ideas in my dreams or B. i should stop taking Designer drugs before i slumber... or maybe a little bit of both.  Either way it is societies fault and not my own.

"event","...and it was long past the time when vh1 insomniac music theater had changed over to ""jump start your day"" that our hero discovered that boy meets world was playing on the disney channel.  Always the nastalgic biped he turns it on as noise to fall asleep too.  Twenty minutes without even pretending to sleep later, our hero is found in his bed balled up in the corner, crying.  
I find it easier to tell this story in third person.  Although it was a very third person experience,  Coupland would say that it was such because he was watching from a perspective that was not that of the person crying.  Adams would probably spin it into a nonsensical version of truth, it wasn't entirely first person because the tears were in the fourth dimension.  Palahniuk i have no doubt would kill off my character within two chapters of the books beginning.  I think it felt so third person because in hind site i really can't tell it through my own eyes.  Maybe on the day i can i will write a book that will make everyone cry.  Until then, i must watch less television late at night."

It reminded me of that huge rollerskate that they drive around the birthday girls and boys from my youth at the roller rink.

The sky was a lovely shade of black and it was raining all day so there were puddles everywhere which i immediately splashed in.  It was drizzling a little bit so everybody on the street was miserable.  i decided to cheer everyone up.  Got in my beautiful blue corolla and blasted Up beat ska music out of my rolled down windows.  It was about the point in the song where it said ""... the sun is shining, every clouds got a silverlineing..."" that i realized i needed my hair in a half pony tail, and i needed to put on my shades (which were found on the corner of musuem and 13th if anyone wants them back).  So i was singing at the top of my lungs when i realized that sorority row just doesn't deserve me.  so i stopped singing.  It was a really happy moment for me.  Though i don't think anyone else got the irony in ""the sun is shining, every clouds got a silver lining"" being blasted whilst they walked/ biked in the rainy, wet dark miserable day it was.

(trust me, it's up beat)
Ugly Day.
I can't believe this ever happened,
I didn't think it ever could,
I'm the author of sappy love songs,
Trading in my bachelorhood.
Something snapped deep inside me,
Something that somebody said,
I felt the brush of angels wings then,
Your voice echoed in my head.

[Chorus:]
Ugly Day the sun is shining,
Every cloud's got a silver lining.
Ugly day the skies are blue,
Now every day is ugly without you.

Are the one pure thing,
That I've always prayed for.
Scales are falling from my eyes,
I must have been so blind before.
I would lie down on the street,
To keep the dust off of your feet,
I would kneel each time I kissed you,
Anything Christie I miss you.

Today was an ugly one,
Just like all the others.
All the flowers and the birds,
Making me feel smothered.
I would lie down on the street,
To keep the dust off your feet,
I would kneel each time I kissed you,
Anything Christie I miss you."

Inventory's been pushed to next weekend for me, so thank goodness I'm having this party Saturday night because I'm going to probably be doing a whole lot of nothing next weekend.

Then last night I'm taking a shower and the fucking knob for the cold water comes off, and the inside is so fucked up and sharp that I can't turn it. UGH. I'm sick of it. So anyway, if I do this I'll only go over there for packing and shit like that and I'll turn off my electric and my cable to save some money. So THERE. As long as my grandma doesn't mind, that is...

Anyway, I did get my picture taken with the bunny from Donnie Darko, and also Bender from Futurama. Ashley got her picture taken with a storm trooper. And I also picked up season one of Sailor Moon, uncut and in Japanese! Hooray! Now I'm going to get all the seasons. Weeeeeee. It's amazing that I've loved this show ever since I was 11 years old.

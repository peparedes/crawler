"event","Today wasn't half bad. Got up early, did some stuff, painted a bunch of my guys, 3 finished and others in various stages of completion. Went to the doc, found out my triglycerides were at 173 and cholesterol was at 334 .. wich must be some mistake because it is usually around 266 ( What can I say.. inherited it from both sides of the family.. damn genes) , So the doc is going to see if they can get another round of testing.. i kinda ate before the last time, so this next time , might be tuesday, I go in for a possible blood draw( next few visits I am not scheduled for any) so that is good. Heh. 

  Kev had a freind from school come over after school today.. they stayed until 8 ( Kinda late for a school night by my thinking). Most of the family is winding down twards bedtime, I am still up and going some. Got my blue ropelight lit up around the window.. adds mood to the room and looks neat. Have the winodws open, listening to the gentle rainfall outside, letting sme of the 52 degree(!!!) air in , airing out the room. It gets kinda stuffy.. and I like fresh air. Got some Isis playing, good melodic slow chill music. ...Just wishing someone were online to chat. Maybe I will try the chatrooms.. hopefully it wont ALL be pervs and assholes.... 

  Tomorow will bring cleaning, and more cleaning, possibly some painting, some organizing, and possible weeding through mom's clothes, see if we cant go through her mass of them that most likely dont fit anymore and get rid of some.. oh and some working out on my end. 

 Tomorow's dinner: Italian seasoned seared boneless-skinless chicken breast over a salad with a balsalmic vinagrette. Ahh.. healthiful and tastiful.... Might see about also making some sort of desert to go along with it."

REesults: Scary

Your probably goth (good for you). But this also makes most of the things you say creepy to others. Your probably trying to be mean but your slighty twisted so you end up scaring people. But who cares they still go away which is what you wanted. Try creeping people out by saying....""Its all Fun and games until someone gets sacraficed to Satan""

  X-mas eve wasnt too bad. The food was good, the company wasnt too bad, And i got some good stuff. Got my comp monitor , some tshorts, and a bag of goodies from Lolo and Papa. I got this kickass Logitech 6.1 surround sound speaker system from mom. I got A neat Tshirt and cd from Kevin, and $50 from dad, $50 from uncle Wayne, and $50 from unle Bryan. I need to use some of that to get a new sound card so it will support all of my speakers. Hehe. Cant wait to get it and hear the sweet sound of music. Right now the three front speakers are working and the large 6"" subwoofer. And It sounds friggin sweet already.

"event","Well.. tomorow is going to be buisy. Get up early, get ready and then go to Sam's Club and then to Aldi, then Jewel Osco and then to drop off some groceries at my second cousin's Ina's place. Then back home, to go out again to the bank and then Best Buy. Then I have a few hours to get ready to go over to Brandi's house, get there about 6-630 then blueman group is at 8, come back to her house after that and spend the night over there. 

  Today wasnt too much of an eventful day. Got the comp fixed and helped them re set it up. It was taking about 5 minutes to open a window and then it would freeze without loading. The game kevin plays n there wasnt really working  and the net would not work at all. So I ended up reformatting it. I didnt put in a password or the multiple accounts, so during the defrags it doesnt stop and go to the beginning screen. They are all happy I reformatted, especially Kev. 
 
  Also went and got a few emergency needs with mom. Like a few grocery items and rabbit food and bedding, and gas for the car since it was pretty much on e, darn gas light was on and dinging. 

  Wow.. X-mas eve and day are almost here. Happy yule/solstice everyone. Now that the shortest day of the year is over.. can look forward to the days getting longer, more sunshine.. if only itt would bring warmer temps .. supposed to be cold as balls out the rest of the week.. and possible snow.. Lucky people in Indiana got 2 feet of it the other day.. and all we got was a slight sprinkle that mostly melted away and is gone now. Darnit. I wonder if the family will behave this year. Last year was...akward.....severely.. as were the years before , due to sharon and my mom being there, Sharon acting the bitch and last year because dad was really hanging on his gf Lanore... Wich he thankfully didnt do at thanksgiving.. toned it down. 

  Well, thats it for now. Laterz."

"event","Well, Tonight was an interesting night. I ran into an old... well.. someone I knew ... I had this sudden urge to go into the "" As seen on T.V. "" store at the local mall. I am looking around when suddenly I feel someone tugging on my jacket sleeve. I look and all of a sudden notice this woman grinning up at me saying hello. She is asking me if I remember her, and asking how I was doing. It took me a minute, but I finally remembered who it was. It was Jessica.. the one from Barnes & noble. Turns out she was fired soon after she sent me the odd email. Had a new manager come in and they fired her, she flit from a couple jobs but ended up coming to that place for now. She seemed really happy to talk to me. I let her know what was going on. She claimed that when she went to check her email a couple months after we last talked, the server was completely gone as was her email account. 
  Guess it must have been fate to bring me into that store. I told her ill come back again sometime soon, she seemed to like hearing that. It brightened up my day. 
  Got shopping knocked out for Kevin and my Dad. Still need to shop for Brandi ( Already know what I am getting her) and already have Mom shopped for.. so my x-mas list is pretty much done. Other than getting/making some cards that is."

   Well, still trying to get my paycheck from work..a nd see if they FINALLY will get my goddamn address correct. I was told to call the other day to see about working on thursday, and so I did. They originally told me ""Nope we dont need you"" so, yeah. Got a call from my supervisor asking me if i would please work on thursday. Guess they change their minds... I duno, is all this trouble with the company due to a lack of communication? Lack of organization? Or what. Other people have been screwed in their paychecks, and have to wait to get the rest of their cash. Bleh, but hey.. its workies.  I guess there is another nurse that I worked with before, who really liked how organized I was. I guess I should talk with her if she is working at this place on thursday. I guess she might even be willing to give me a lift to the jobsites. 

   Talked for a while with Monique earlier.. well.. she did most of the talking.. for about an hour.... Bleh. I guess she is smoking again. But her husband.. who is pretty muh a chain smoker basically quit. In a week. With that Smoke Away... it is an herbal suppliment that negates the desire for the nicotene, and even is an appatite supressor ( To combat the weightgain usually associated with quitting smoking) I think I will have to look into gett some.. its like $45 for the kit. People quit in 1-10 days. WOuld be worth a try. I have tried the patches.. they give me chest pains. I have tried the losenges, they make it hard to breathe... so hey.. maybe this will be different, not so many chemicals"

"event","Went through some things earlier. Ended up going through my old address book. Copied out Becky's number from there... need to try giving that a call.. have to prepare myself mentally. Going over the thing... I got down... 90% of the names in there are blacked out.. everyone from friends I lost track of, stopped talking to.. hurt me... to ex girlfriends on and off the net.  Also found some ex gf pictures....  Brandi said soemthing about maybe friday getting together and haveing a bonfire and a few drinks. Sounds like it is a plan... Burn away the past. 
 
  Looking over how far I have come... fom grade school... to hell of a middle school ( darn catholic school harder on ya than public school.. the kids nto the teachers..) to high school. Thinking back to my freshman year.. being a ignorant noobie to life. Trying to fit in and understand. To sophmore year.. where I had friends, and a group to belong to... to jr year where i lost friends.. lost the group, withdrew into myself and discovered the internet... to senior year.. lonely year, for the most part, except for a few classes. met my first in person gf there.. started off as friends. That ended horribly.... Thinking back to out of high school years. How I have grown.. outgrown old aquantiences... made new ones.. lost many new ones... thinking of the groups i eventually surrounded myself with friendwise.. then lost track of them , blocked them out or fucked it up with... To recent groups I belinged to... and one person fucking it up for me and losing most of the people i thought i could think of as ""friends"" 
   Naievity is gone a little. Need to get rid of it. Notice the world ... how low I stand in it. I need to do soemthing with myself. Sure i have a Job... that doesnt schedule me much.. but at least I have my inner circle of friends... I dont call it Best Friends anymore... its an Inner Circle... A small group of those who know the real me.. who accept the real me... who I accept... I dont know what I'd be doing now if not for them. I talk to them often.. or in the case of some not as often as I wish... I just want them to know.. Thanks for being here... Dont know what I'd do without you... 
  Anywho... I need to get more on top of things in my life... I have the stuff, just need a ride to the DMV.. get the fucking permit.. Need to then get driving... find a car ..cheap pos that will get me places.... maybe either get more hours at this job.. or get another.. I am stalled ins chooling.... And its mainly my fault... I need to go through with it.. bite the fucking bullet and get shit done.. I am in a bit of a limbo developing myself.. some peopel say i need to have this transition.. the meds are helping... now i just need to stop being a bit gutless and grba life by the fuckin balls and don let go. 
 well, thats all for now.. leave comments.... n stuff..."

  Oh well, whats there cannot be changed currently. So enough of that. Today has been pretty much filled with bumming around the house, a nice walk around the block, and other boring stuff. I need to do something, but not sure what exactly. Still havent gotten that letter, I am thinking of sending out another one to see if I will finally get it. This whole mail thing is ridiculus. I am not wondering if they are putting it in the wrong box ,I am wondering if they even are delivering it. Work still hasn't called to ask me if I wanted to work . Guess they must have forgotten about me. Then again, the flu shot shortage, I wonder if alot of the other people were also cancelled. 
  A friend of mine hasnt talked to me one bit, its like one week we are fine, then she doesnt even really call me, its like.. K... Well, at least I have my Inner Circle of friends. They are all who matter to me right now. 
  Dinner, probbaly going to make some chicken kiev, coprdon bleu and cheedar and broccoli for dinner, probably bake some russets , and heat up some peas or green beans.

"event","Spent today in Chicago. Had fun. Went to the merchendice mart, unfortunately due to the big fall show this weekend most of the stores werent open. Picked up an xmas gift for my mother though. Then we went to the virgin store. Picked up a cd that was on like a severe clearance.. mm.. good ol mudvayne. Then went to Vosges. This world famopus chocolate place. Ohh... such good truffles in odd combos. I picked up this little carry out pack of 4. Was a little expensive, but well worth it. Sure beats godiva. Then we went into another store there. Then walked a bit to a popcorn place. They have kille rpopcorn, so i picked up a small mixed bag. 
  After that we went back tot he parking garage, and then went to the north side and visited the Alley. This lovely goth place. Picke dup a couple o buttons for my backpack. One says ""Fuck Bush"" the other one is funny also, and severely shits on bush.. wich is a good thing. Drooled over some of the mercandice. While we were there, this guy yelled out a couple o times really loudly, behind a closed door. I wonder what he got pierced... whatever it was i bet it rarely sees the light of day .. if ya catchmy drift ;-) hehe. Then we went into this neat hippie type store, had some neat stuff there. Then went to Buca's , this killer italian restraunt. Its liek ..sooo.. kick ass.. drank most of a bottle of wine there. She onle wanted a couple o glasses, and she had to drive, so it was up to me to finish. Eh, was this lovely semi sparking red. I ordered this rolled pizza with carmelized onions, prochutto and mushrooms with a marinera dipping sauce. Brought back about half of it. Breakfast ;-) hehe. 
  Well, tomorow its back to the deckbuilding. Dad i bet put in the flooring today, wasnt too hard a task to do and could only do it one thing at a time due to one nailer and one compressor. So tomorow i deal with posts, spindles and railings oh my.. oha nd most liekly framing in the lattice work. fun fun. Then allw e ahve to do is re screen some stuff, put in a new door, move a gutter ( i think dad might have done that already) and thats the end of that. hehe. 
  OO, and I picked up this killer candle. Its called ""thunderstorm"" and it has the smell of liek fresh peat, and grass and the wind, and its like killer.. brings back fond childhood memories. Was like half off, so i was like ""Yey""
  Well, thats all for now, tune in tomorow for more updates of "" Karls crap"""

Was a truckload.We finished framing out the deck, even added in the metal support brackets.All we have to do now is lay down some 1x4x8's and some 1x4x12's for the flooring, put in3 nails for each board in each crossbeam. Then put on the posts , and the spindles, railing and then frame in some latticework for around the base. 
  Back is stiff, it hurts to sit lay or even walk. Eh, is worth it tho, getting a workout and making a little cash and learning. 
Tomorow is civil war days. Have to go out to Delwood park for it. Hopefully wont be too long there. Sunday will be a day of rest. And then back to work on Monday. Yipee... Should get paid monday or tuesday. 
 I also picked up the new 40k rulebook. Been having to force myself not to drool over the neat pictures, converting ideas and learning the new rules. Hehe.
Talked to Shatav earlier. I was glad she was on. Hopefully will be able to talk to her more often."

"event","Ahh, well, today didnt go exactly how I had planned. Woke up at about 10, getting about ...5.. hours of sleep. Eh, ill make it up eventually. Did my usual walk around the block soon after. Taked to Brandi for a bit, and it was good. Then Dad called. Needed my help on a deck job. Ended up crawling in the dirt to place a jack in place, helped lifting a support beam into place, and securing it. Cut off about half or so of the deck , so they have room where the deck was twards the west fence in the back yard. The deck was leaning, sagging, rotting. And whoever built the thing must have been severely drunk because it was shoddy work. Its ok tho, some of the lumber was in excellent condition, so we are saving them money by reusing some of it. Get to go tomorow and put in another support beam underneath to stop a little more sagging, shore it up around the corner of the house, lay some crossmembers and buttjoint/block them together. Need to go get some more 2x8""s . And hey, gives me some cash for helping out, and getting a good workout by doing it. Hehe. Tis bit of a dirty job though, have to crawl in the dirt underneath to get the jacks in place and the beams in place and shored up. 
 So, tomorow i get to get up bright and early ( bleh) and go help dad. Also get to install a new screen door, re screen the porch, move a gutter spout, and all sorts of fun and knowledge. 
  They should make a movie, and have the croc hunter guy do the subtitle voice. You know, where you can put it to comemntary and language select . Would be hilarious as hell. 
 Well, i'm off to get squeaky clean, take care."

  Took the day basically for myself. I went through my 40k vehicles. Seeing what needed to be repaired, what needs a paint or repaint, and what parts i will have to order for one of my land raiders. Finished putting together some things, like an attack bike i didnt know i had the pieces for. hehe. Takes up about the whole top of my dresser, as mush room as my individual figures. I forgot how large my force was. Hehe.  What is also funny was when i glued some plastic pieces, and metal pieces to my fingers. Was fun trying to unglue them. Hehe. 
 Went out to delta sonic, got the car washed and all that good stuff, picked up a large energy drink there. Perked me up some. Made a big dinner. Chicken I slow - cooked then de boned, and gravy, stuffing, green beans and some fresh rolls. Was pretty yummy. Its kinda odd eaing at the dining room table again. 
  Well, tomorow I will clean my room more, taking it a little slowly, need to really dust and vacuum and go thru some more of my stuff. I am slowly trying to go thru and cleaning out drawers and the such. Categorizing my stuff. I need to get some plastic tubs, would be eaier for storage and moveability. 

  Just got a call from Christina, she said I am going out with them tonight, that i am not allowed to say no. So i am going, wil be fun. Heh. So I bid you aidou for now. I shall post tomorow sometime. Enjoy your evening. I know I will."

Good for mornings when ya need to groove out of bed. 
  I noticed Johnston's music, or at least what i have of it, reminds me of the newer Collide, so it sounds more Darkwave-ish than Trance-ish. 

  Less than an hour before i am going out and about.. need to grab a shower, and get all Spiffied up. yey, going to get some more Foamcore. Need to make some templates for gothic-style windows. I think a nice ruined Imperial shrine would be neat. Its either that or a warehouse. Heh.

If i get into the study will get free doc visits, free medicines, and free lab tests. Instead of it being $50 for each doc visit, 400-500 for each month's medication, and also however much lab tests would be. I sincerely hope that I am in this program. So far they gave me a sample box of the medication, so i guess they are trying to see how i react to the med .So far it has let me sleep fully, no waking up, and i am not having my swings as hard. I dont go into way far on either end of the scale. So far...

Well, shes one of my drinkin buddies out there... itl come to me eventually. Came home last night, early evening, and the net wouldnt come on. I messed with the driver and such on here.. and it got lateee so i said fuck it for the night. Came on thismorning, unplugged it for about 20 minutes hit it a few times, plugged it back on, worked right away.. ahh brute force works most times. 

 And, what all you are waiting for, details of the trip. Sorry to say, but, there arent too many details. Got there.. about here to past memphis in about 7.5 hours, no one was home so we sat and had a beer waited for Mike to get home. Said our hellos and then took a dip into the pool. Had a free day sunday, but i dont remember what we did ... got up at about 7, worked until about 5, had dinner, sat around for a short time outside and then went to bed. Didnt get a chance to ge into Memphis at all though...

  Casinos. They were fun, down in Tunica. Drove past some rice pattys, and some cotton fields. Went to the Gold Strike, had an excellent seafood buffet there. Ate dinner, drinks were free there, so had a few of those, didnt gamble there though. Walked to the sheraton, ( this was a complex of 3 casinos side by side) and walked around, had a few more drinks there, i put in a couple o bucks , gained a couple back, only ended up going away with 5 dollars lost though. Then went over to the horse shoe, it was packed. It had the most people out of all three there, didnt gamble, but had a couple of drinks again. Then stumbled back over to the gold strike, listened to the live blues band there, had a cola ( when the pavement starts tilting as i walk, its time to stop drinking) and then we headded back over to Mike's house. 

  Had a little work left to do on saturday morning, just some caulk work, finished putting in the door and the trim... wasnt too bad. Left there at about 4pm, got back here to Braidwood at about 11. It was a fun time, spent some time with dad, got a little too much sun though.. now when i lay even on a soft sheet and i lay on the burn its like laying on gravel.. demmit. Next time i use more than a spf15 even if that is all I have.

 Here's how it is supposed to go. I wake up on Saturday. He picks me up, Connie follows in her car. We head on 55 down to 57, take 57 through the state all the way down to memphis, hop onto 280 ( I think) and get off at the Olive Branch exit. Unfortunately we do not cross into Ky, demmit, so I will have to pay 20 cents tax on smokes, rather than the 3 cents Ky has ( better than our 99 cent tax) He mentioned some large fireworks place in Missouri, like a supermarket setup.. so might get soemthing fun to play around with, and blow fingers off with (jk). 
 
 Also, we are most liekly going to one of the casino's again ( last time i had to wait out while they gambled a little) for the nice seafood buffet..mm... yummyness.. We get there saturday afternoon or evening. Sunday is a day of rest and relaxation and recovery from the trip.Monday we start the work. Most liekly beginning in the garage wall work. Shouldnt take too long to demolish that. He knows I smoke now, promised to keep it from other family members who have too much on their plate already to worry about me. 

  All I have left to pack is my shaver, some pit stick, a few socks, books, cologne,and my during trip stuff ( cd's snack , soda) And I need to pick up a fishing pole of mine from where they are being stored at my grandparents. Should be fun.. I am thinking, if not, I will deal. 
 
  If you have need to reach me.. my number is (815)557-5510 for my cell, wich I will have with me. Feel free to drop a line.. most likely will be boring for the most part.. then again give me a bit of tinfoil and some tape and im all set for hours :P. 
 
  Take care all those I care about, I will be thinking about you."

"event","Oh shit. I almost forgot.... The avy on here is part of an OOP ( Out Of Production) Death Jester. Unfortunately, the line of miniatures hasnt been made as of yet, although they still have rules. I miss the lovely harlequins kiss.... such a lovely weapon. Straps on like a bracer, there is like a small fluted wand coming forward from the bracer.. and it spits out a monofillament wire bundle, which erupts out into a tangled mass of one molecule thick wire goodness... basically slicing the target apart at the molecular level, leaving a fine mist of their fluids and body. ** shudders with the joyous thought** Best part is, its not ranged, you have to stick the end onto the target.. would be a gruesome and wondrous sight.. would be fun if we could come up with better technologies like that. 

 Oh, and no, I am not psychotic.. just amazed at the thoughts people have at times. Hehe"

"event","Not too much happened. Woke up at about 7ish. Mom left for church, got up lil bro at about noon. Then went out for some chineese for lunch. Went over to Home Depot to the gardening department, picked up some plants for outside, and some new pots, for the sweet potato plant and my plant in my room. Also picked up some clear matte spray, for miniatures so they wont chip as easy, and for my cigarette case for when i end up painting it ( no more crushed cigs or broken ones from those damn softpacks) It smells like ass, but it does the job. Also got some stain.. they dont make the kind I used when i did my shelf, so I eyed it and matched it up as well as I could. This will work well, and when my staff is done, ill lace the linseed oil with a tiny bit off stain, not so that it will stain the wood exactly, more so that it will get into the receses in the carvings, and slightly shadow it. 

  That was pretty much my day. I go tomorow with lil bro to go see the new harry potter. Movie starts at 3:45. Will get picked up when the movie is over. It gives us bonding time.. and I am itching to see the movie. :D Hehe. Also started packing some things.. like swimming trunks some toiletires I have set aside for travel, my BDU camo pants. They are thin, so will be good if i need some leg protection but want to avoid the damn heat, also packed in my insulated flannel. 

  Less than a week now.. I am dreading it and yet anticipating it. Will be nice spending some time with dad. But.. dont know how he will react to the whole smoking bit. He saw me on X mas and didnt say too much. Oh well, he will have to put up with it, tis me. Also, going someplace, and being around new(ish) people. Will be a little odd, but I am sure I can get over it. Will have to stop in Ky, carton of basic are about $35 here... down there it is about $17.99.. not too bad down there, if I may say so myself. heh. Oh, and got a cheap(ish) hat. My old one kinda shrunk with getting wet with summer rains from last year, and faded something fierce witht he sun. Its not too corny ( its hard to find the right hat alot of the time) But, Will do the job. Need to dig out the sunscreen.. I guess the meds I am on makes it easier for me to get a burn.. and last time I went swimming and working in the sun my skin bubbled and it was hard wearing a shirt.. so no more to that, must protect what pastyness I have. Hahaha. 

  Oh, and if you want me while I am gone, I will have my cell on, and I have a buncha minutes to burn. So, feel free to call, or let me know to give you a jingle. Will be good for breask and lack of net for a week. heh."

"event","Ahh, what a life I lead. Hehe. Went to a few places today, picked up some new music, and the new LOTR, watched it, it deviated from the book but the basic plotlines were there.. I wish they would go with the book sometimes. I mean... come on... buncha halflings with weapons killing humans.. would be fun to watch. 
  
  Anywho, back on track. Heh. Dad called me the other day with an offer. A friend of his down in Mississippi had termites. Need to check the studs in a wall for damage,tear out drywall on the garage side of the wall and then replace it and any studs that might be damaged.  And they want to put a new side door where a window is in a garage.. this house is only about 5-7 years old.. they designed it and already want to change it.. But anywho, he asked me to go with him. 
 It would be a week with him, just me and him down there. Staying with them, they have an outdoor pool, and this lake is about 30 feet from the house (waterfront property). Do some fishing, and spend some time with my dad. Havent had a chance to do that lately.. its been a while actually. And well, it was his birthday last weekend, and I asked him what he wanted and he said time with me. 
  So, I am thinking of lettinghim know tonight I am going. It would make him happy, I get to go on a free roadtrip, away from home for a week. And also do some remodelling that I have been craving. I know I just came back from a time away from the net... kinda will be jonesing for another net fix I bet during that week... but I am willing to suffer it. 

  Well, thats my current Dilema. And thats all for now that I can think of.. Oh, heres a quote for the day:

"event","Sorry for the gap in posts there... It kind of helps to have the cable bill paid if one wants internet and TV.  
  
  Well,here is what has been happening:

 1) I went and got help for my illness. Waited 9 fuckin hours in the hospital.. but I guess I cant complain... meds and doc were free and only had one doc on duty. And I guess my waiting was partially productive. I read some, talked, went half mad listening to UPN ( shows like the hughlys and fresh prince) I swear.. if I had the chance to never watch that station again.. I would be one happy man. 

 2)Met a new person. She is on the same book series I am re-reading. I noticed and she kept looking over at me, and she didnt seem to notice the book until I pointed it out. Then again.. her being the only other white person other than me and my mom and her mother being there.. that could have had something to do with it. I went out and had a smoke with her, while she left for a bit, and we talked. I gave her my e-mail addy.. so hopefully I will be hearing from her again soon. She came back later on, waved at me, and then when she went out for a smoke, she motioned for me to follow her. Hopefully I wont blow it as with the last new person I met. She seemed more open and talkative though, so I guess that is a good thing, and she is open to spirits, wich is good also. 
 
 3) I have started on my new meds. It's kicking my ass. I take it at 9 am and 9 pm. I am lucky to stay up until 10pm, and lucky to sleep until past 6 am. It kocks me the fuck out, and I have been in almost a stupor all day. Should pass after a few weeks though.. hopefully. he doc told me i went to the wrong place, but gave me meds until i could get to the place I needed to go to. So, I have to call them this week, and see what I can arrange. Oh, and Tinley Park did not want me since I was not a threat to myself or others. When I set foot on the grounds... the negativity around, I wouldnt wish my worst enemy to the place. Second floor at St Joes isnt too bad.. but this place felt.. wrong.. evil.. not natural in the hate and pain and suffering. It was hard to even enter the place. 
 
 4) I started woodcarving on my staff. So far theres this old man, with a long beard and hair.. need to figure out how to do the hat on him. Figured it would make a good wizened wizard. And on the top , I have planned on doing it as a snake, and then setting a crstal into its mouth, like its swallowing it. Hopefully, it will look cool.. need to look for/find ideas on what to do with the rest of the open space. Also have been painting again.. dont have a colour I need so.. thats on stand by for the moment. The cloaks look awesome though. 

   Not much else going on. Took my offline time, and did some cooking, spending time with family. Went down to springfield for the day, to get moms nursing license renewed. Cleaned out and organized stuff on the computer, uploaded some music. Well, that is it for this post for the moment."

"event","Watching tv. Put on Hometime, and I miss being able to work on the house, or in a garden. I long to be able to design and do things around the yard. They did a cottage type garden. With these brick pavers. Just watching it I had many ideas. I also miss the satisfaction of growing my own veggies. The juiciness and flavor of a fresh vine ripe tomato, or other veggies. 
 I wish I had someplace to do it with. Have a good plan out in my head. Have a small area for different herbs. A corner where I can make like a small arch type thing, with a bench underneath it. Train some different vines over it. Anything from some small creeping roses, to grapevines. Somewhere to sit out in the shade and enjoy. It would be a simple matter. get some lattice, and some 4x4's.Use that post shovel to seat the 4x4's firmly in the ground, use them as the frame, on the 4 corners. Lattivecowrk with some L trim, to hold it in place, and some thing strips of wood to hold the lattice in place. notch out the top of the 4x4's and screw it into place, benches are simple, thompsons to keep out the water and damage, and give it a nice stain color. Would be nice and shady on a warm summers day. Put out some different flower beds and the such. 
  It would be fun to have access to a woodshop again. I have some shelving I want to make, and some other items. I have one made.. need to dig it out of a pile of stuff from my father's house, and just re stain a peg, and then put on a coat of poly on it. And it will be all set to hang. To have all of it would be expensive to buy, and it would be cheaper to make, and better made.. some of the shit they try pushing on us.. the MDF that whenever water gets into it it will warp, or easily bow under any weight. Give me good old wood. Pine, oak, cedar. Things this day and age are too poorly made. Maybe that is why so many go for Amish work. They use real materials, not the shit they push off on us now of days, and it tends to be a little cheaper than different furniture stores. I would rather pay a couple hundred for wood, and put a few weeks or months work into making a bed, rather than paying a few thousand dollars for what I could do myself. 
  But, you live with what you have, and can get. Ill just have to see if i can get an area to set up a shop. It would keep me busy."

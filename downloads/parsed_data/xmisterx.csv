"event","Well today was interesting I thought I was so screwed when I got to School and I had to do an AP Chemistry quiz online which I never did anyway, and the AP Statistics worsheet which I never did, and the Taq outline. Well i was saved in most of those things Thanx to Gio I got the Math done, The AP Chemistry website is on the fritz so it turns out so i never had to do the quiz and the taq outline was the only thing I didn't do so w/e I guess the day could have been worse. After school I went home only to go to track at 4:30. Wow was it killer, I heard coach Belle saying that we were gonna go to the weight room so I was excited. Then when we got there it was crazy. I cant feel my legs right now as I type but I guess its all for the greater good. Tommorrow we go to the weightroom for upper body now thats gonna suck but I guess whatever helps me get stronger will work for me.

Until next time Peace to All"

"event","Well the party was prety good though it was packed with people that were not supposed to be there. Somehow some rumor got started that it was an open house party so I think that took alot away from it. Had there been less people like only the Belen guys and the girls it would have been much better. But props to sanch it did turn out pretty good for the massive amount of people that were theree. Marina I had a great time. I know what your gonna say but I did have a good time none the less. And if I had to I'd do it all over again for you. So I think the party went well and we'll see how the party next semester goes if he decides to have it after all.

But w/e i dont really care, After school we went to Naranja and helped some mexican kids with math and english then we played some soccer with them and overall it was fun. Marina is at work right now but she leaves at 11 so i will call her then and talk for a while. After that I suppose i check out the post debate coverage from NBC and maybe some other stuff. But whatever.

"event","Wow, today was soOo boring. There was no one shopping at all and to top it all off i had to work from 9 am to 5 pm. But thats ok because i thought i was gonna be able to go to the movies tonight at least. Was I able to no. My parents wouldnt let me. They say all my working, which was their idea to begin with, and my going out and having a social life is affecting my grades. Now I ask them what a 4.4 GPA isnt good enough for you. And they answer no. They are beginnig to sound like Rene's parents, no offense. Then i keep asking for a reason that has some sustenance to it and they give me the ""because I don't want you to"" answer. Wow im so tired I was really not in the mood for that BS so i told them off which probably wont put em in good standings with them at all but I really don't care right now.

"event","Wow another weekend shot to hell by yet another hurricane. This is rediculous. I hope this is the last hurricane to hit on a weekend i mean not one hurricane has hit during the week all of them hit during the weekend. Bu twhatever and to top it off Belen suffered yet another loss to chaminade. But its okay I have faith that they will pick up and win a bunch of games later on. All they have to do is cut out the mental mistakes and they could have won every game including the chaminade game. For those wondering the score was 42 - 7. But its okay youll see well make it to regionals some how. To put the icing  on the cake yesterday my boss called me and said i had to go in today so i went to work from 8 am till 5:15 pm. It was hell all the people were going crazy and shit it looked like the end of the world but now its time to relax.

Then I had to get to work on the Philosophy test outlines for me and everyone else who wanted them. After I did that i posted the questions and some definitions on the website as well. The I had to get to reading Tartuffe. Between all this I managed to get some time to work out as well. but all in all i think both tests went well. I hope I got an A on both so well see later on this week what the outcome was.

I have 2 quizes which im not gonna study for ne way. Im sure that work today is not going to be fun at all since last night I went to sleep at like 1:30 am talking to Marina but thats not a bad way to spend the night. By the way we have to figure out something for the chaminade game gurl. Whatever thats on Friday, first we should get there right. LOL. Hopefully tommorrow isn't too bad and the weekend comes quick.

"event","Well this weekend could have been worse I guess. I went fishing on saturday, Didn't catch very muh but Quality over Quantity I always say. We, my dad and I, Caught a 47 lb. dolphin and Right when we were in a school of dolphin this marlin showed up to mess up the day but I threw him a dolpinh on a hook add he took it. So we also managed to catch and release a white marlin as well. It weighed approximately 150 lbs. or so. So i guess had I been in the Belen tournament I would have shown everyone up but its better that I didn't waste my money. Aftter fishing, I went to the movies with Marina. But it was fun overall and work today wasn't half bad, the tips were good although my shift was 8 and 1/2 hours long but w/e. Time flies when u r having fun.

But w/e next week Chaminade, Marina you are going to that game as well if i can take you or not. If anyone knows what time and day the game is leave a comment telling me so i can check my schedule. But yea and Foster in track is going beserk how does he think that he can get me to bench 300 pounds plus by december thats like impossible but he says he can do it and so can i so well see how things turn out. Aside from all that everything is going good. My life is a joy and i hope everyone elses is too

But whatever Ill manage to study in school since Im there at like 6:40 and hopefully get the grade I need but if not once again whatever."

Oh and Gio if you read this the offer to go to the beach still stand we are planning to go tommorrow around 10 or so and come back like at 4, so if you can go just give me a call. Oh and Gio Marina is free to come to the beach if she can. I forgot Gio your gonna be in Kansas well have a good time Gio. 
   Results are in Gio:
Art History A+
English     B+
Math        ??
Chemistry   ??
Government  B+
Biology     A+
Economics   A+
Theology    A

   So i should end up with like a 4.7 GPA but that will only boost my CUM to like a 3.8 unlike yours Gio which is like a 4.3 or something but whatever. 

   Have a great summer everyone I know I will as a senior. Yea boys thats right were seniors already so live it up."

"event","Even though most people said PA's test was a complete rape and they wasted their time studying for it I beg to differ. I never studied for it due too a lack of time, if a certain someone does not believe me you may contact Micheal Fernandez and ask him how much I studied for PA's final, and of course I found the test to be rather challenging and it did have many questions which I had never seen before but I feel that if I had studied more I could have done well. As is I'm hoping for a curve to bump me up to a B on the final, which would be excellent, but if that does not happen I think we should get together and complain to the administration. This test of PA's was no where near a fair test and that is why I thk we should complain, I mean almost no one even finished and most people left between 20 and 30 questions blank on the test anyway so all I can say is pray guys pray every night until that progress report comes in. If PA does not curve it may God have pity on our souls and on our Grades."

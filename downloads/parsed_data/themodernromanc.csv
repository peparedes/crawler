While I am downtown, I need to drop stuff off at the library, then hit up dollarama to look for things to decorate the lounge with.
Then I need to come back and talk to Ana about my residence fees.
Then I need to come back eat, then go and meet nicolette to do a case study / business critique on a business for school
then i need to come home clean so i can do two more case studies in my place

"event","I just spent two nights in Edmonton.
Well Tuesday night Jeanie, Nicolette, and I made plans to go to the Black Dog to try to meet some boys, but an emergency happened and nicolette had to go to the hospital and I spent from 5.30-1.30 in the hospital. Nicolette is fine, and the hospital was actually really fun. Jeanie had her gangsta headphones and i had my ipod so we had a dance party. So I phoned Daryl while I was at the hospital to tell him that I couldn't make it to the Black Dog because I was at the hospital and I was like uh, do you want to meet me here and come visit? And he was like ""no, it's raining and it's too far."" Fucker. I want a boyfriend that will meet me for late night bike rides. Blah. I haven't seen him for over a month. And then I told him I was in town for another night and he was like oh. And then I told him I had to get my stuff from his house Friday and he said well call me Thursday night then and tell me what time. He works nights, and to make sure I could get my stuff I called him at noon today, and all I said was ""did you figure out what time you worked?"" And he said yeah at 5, and I said ""okay I will call you tomorrow morning before I come over to get my stuff, Bye"". I didn't wait for him to say anything, but like he would anyways. SO retarded dramatic. I'm lame for even trying to make things work.
So, with that in my mind, I used that as motivation to try to score a date or something lastnight to make myself feel better about the situation. 
Oh, and I was successful. When I first moved to Edmonton, I went to the Organ by myself because I really wanted to go and it was like my third night in Edmonton, so I went by myself. And I met these guys, who felt bad for me because I sitting by myself and invited me to sit with them. Anyways, these guys were totally awesome and halarious and gave me a ride home and everything. Lastnight, I ran into one of the guys and he was like ""april, the organ!"" And then he talked etc and he asked for my phone number. And I was like ""I don't have a phone number"" which sounds like a total lie but I don't move to Edmonton until tomorrow. And then he tried to give me his but I didn't have a pen or paper. So I was like uhhh and he was like uhhh. Later that night, I ran into him again and he asked again if I found a paper and so I gave him nicolettes phone number, and apparently him and his friend want to go on a double date next weekend. Woooop! So let's see if they phone. 
Nicolette wasn't interested in his friend, but she said that she would go just for me. 
We met some other guys too. I'm not really looking for anything, but you know it's nice to feel liked once in a while. 
I am hungover from lastnight, and threw up twice on the bus this morning. I need to go shower! I move tomorrow!"

It doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but I explained to him that I needed to know because otherwise I would have to make other arrangments to stay elsewhere. And of course he neglected to. So that was the final straw. 
It's not a big deal at all, but I want to be with someone who is thoughtful, caring, and supportive and he isn't all three. He's gone. Who knows if he has already decided that I am gone too. Whatever. It's just going to be tough to get my shit back and then have to see him all the time since we live a block away from eachother, go to the same school, and he works next to my house. Fucker.
On the brighter side, I talked to Nicolette and she broke up with her younger boyfriend as well. We both had tried this new thing 'dating younger men' and we both agree NOPE. NEVER AGAIN. 
It feels good. I can let go now.

my trip across Canada and beyond is going well so far. We bussed through Saskatchewan, spent the day in Winnipeg, stopped at a few towns in Western Ontario, and now I am in Ottawa. Ottawa is gorgeous! Everywhere is really clean. We spend the day at the parliament buildings and by the river. I love the fact that you can look across the river and see Quebec. Winnipeg is nice, but there is nothing to do there. We pretty much spent the day lounging in Central Park, at the Ledge, and exploring a bit of the downtown. The tap water in Winnipeg is the worst ever. It tastes like pure mold. The tap water in Saskatchewan is randomly bad as well. Blah! Tomorrow I get to see Rob. We are meeting at the National Archives parking lot. I'm excited. We are hoping on a bus to Halifax tomorrow at 5, and we should be arriving the next day sometime in the evening where we plan on getting a room at the hostel and then spending the night drinking cheap wine and going pubing. 
Spending hours on the bus isn't bad. I kinda like it. I've been busy reading, staring at out the window, sleeping, grooving to music, and listening in on bus conversations. I like the random stops we have in really shitty shitty towns. 
I went almost four full days without showering. It was awesome. We decided we smelt like sex, which just made us look like bigger lesbians. Oh, and everyone has been speaking french to us. Apparently, we must look french.

Yeah, we had a BBQ at Melissa's house in Sherwood Park afterwards. I kinda got into the gin and started telling peverted stories. It was awesome, we made tasty veggie burgers. blah blah."

I've got the travel itch sooo bad. I've been stuck in this city too long. It's only like another month until I travel across Canada, but I really want to travel overseas right now.
Nicolette, Steph, Linds, and I are going to Thialand after we grad for 6 ish weeks, and then I am thinking about going to Indonesia for a few weeks after that.. I wish it was this summer.
blah, so far away...

I like the idea that I have the best valid excuses on my lack of cooking skills.
I'm a vegetarian so I have no idea how to cook meat (even when I did eat meat, I had no idea)
And I'm the worst at making any kind of fancy steamed vegetable dish (I believe in a RAW food diet)
Yeah, so pretty much I can make rice."

I had ice cream! which totally has made me feel like crap. I also ate a sandwich today. Yesterday was the last day of my cleanse.
I went to Denny's with friend Brooke. It was fun, as always. Tomorrow we are going to the farmers market. I need to clean my place. Brooke says I look a lot healthier -- she hasn't seen me for three weeks. I feel good. 
I went to Karaoke with Daryl lastnight. We met up with Marko and his flame. I sang Whip It with Mark, and Daryl and I sang Lump. It was a pretty good night. We slept in till like 3.30 in the afternoon, and then got up and went and got safeway sandwiches. mmmm safeway sandwiches. I got a huge one, so I still have 1/2 of one in the fridge and I am kinda still stoned right now.
I'm also tired, and told Brooke I'd be ready to go by 10 tomorrow morning, which is going to be toughhhhh....
It is beautiful out right now. It's like plus 6, and kinda windy. mmm..."

"event","today is day 5 of my cleanse and I feel really really great. Before I was sleeping 9-10 hours a day, and now I've been sleeping 6-7 and I feel really well rested, and there are no needs for napping. I did go out and drink lastnight, but I stuck to gin & tonics. I've totally noticed that my clothes are fitting a lot better to. It's only been 5 days, but I probably reduced my calorie intake by at least 30%. My latenight food cravings have diminished, my skin is clearing up, and I just feel really good. I'm really motivated to keep on track."

I started the cleanse...
I bought a new scarf...

"event","we took more kirlian pictures today, and mine came up toxic as usual. Although, when I did my exercise one there was no breaks at all.
So I made an appointment with a holistic practitioner, to go over nutritional anaylsis, herbs for my body, and I go for reflexology this Saturday and I am going to go get a touch for health session. 
I'm going to do this.

I also was on my way to go buy my favourite cleanse, but I fall asleep. (ha, just proves I really need to do a cleanse, eh)
I don't have the 30$ for the cleanse, but money means nothing over my health. I'm going to do this 12 day cleanse, then go take another kirlian picture.
I'm on a mission to take a good one."

"event","You know what sucks, not being able to find anything like my TV remote or my laundry card because of moving. You know what rocks, finding things you kinda forgot about like my old journal:
this is what I was doing today, 1 year ago:

""Being unemployed is great! I house sat for a week and babysat one day for Candy. Had a ball game - we lost but it was fun & I'm super sore! My leg muscles hurt! ahh! Went to Kelowna & visited Becky lastnight. Tonight Stef and I saw BORN INTO BROTHELS at the Salmar Classic. Thrift store has been ok. I got a sega with 10 games for $2. Its just missing a chord, but my moms creepy friend collects old nitendos and says he has a extra chord forme. I got a really cool medical kit from the army that I've been using as a purse. I found my banana board. Im getting better at riding it. I'm used to where my feet go on the board & can get going. I need to adventure pass my driveway where there is more & better room to practice. My eyes are pretty heavy... zz.... I just fought a cold. The only thing that really happend was my glands swelled for 2 days & I was really tired. I drank too much caffine today. NO MORE CAFFIENE APRIL! Weakerthans in Kelowna were so good! the sounded better than on their CD. It was pretty rock-out. I saw PHIL there, Oliver's friend. I need to clean the basement before Wayne discovers my mess. I haven't been ere the last week because of house sitting. NOTE TO SELF: make an idea book. Bretts been tryin to be good friends again. I'm very hesitant. ""the secret lives of twist ties""
I'm going to go and read now."

"event","WELL, after a night full of carrying boxes down a flight of stairs, and a day full of bleach and a magic eraser, I am done moving. I just have to put everything away now. My old room was so dirty. There was so much dust everywhere. I already feel better being in this clean room, away from my allergies. I just went to the library and picked up my library holds. For entertainment, I have two more discs of Degrassi, a new memoir called Fat Girl to read, a book about being a Pagan, and a bunch of cd's including Janet Jackson's decade CD with NASTY on it. I watched Shop Girl lastnight with my sister. Jason Shwartzmen was dreamy and then we watched Garden State. I decided my celebrity dream man would consist of 1/8 Jason Schwartzmen, 1/8 Zach Braff, 1/8 Luke Wilson, 2/8 Ethan Embry, 1/8 Jake Gyllenhall, 1/8 Joaquin Phoenix, & 1/8 Ryan Gosling. 
I think I'm gonna go nap.

"event","well I made an attempt to get ready for moving tomorrow
I did 6 loads of laundry. I washed my four blankets, my sheets, and two loads of clothes, and I still have towels to wash. I'm just too tired to do anything else. 
I also went and bought a few groceries. Dawn might be coming up tomorrow to help. I hope so. This is too much effort. I got rid of my big computer monitor, a garbage bag full of clothes, a old toaster oven, and I am debating getting rid of my stereo. I don't use it, and it is taking up so much room. I just use my computer to listen to music. I have a small cd player in salmon arm that I can use. 
WHEN IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT. 
it has some sweet stickers on it though, oh well. I'm a packrat trying to go minimilst. I don't think I could ever be one of those people that has one cardigan, 5 pairs of socks, two blankets, three pairs of shows, etc etc etc. I have too many interests and too much nice stuff.

First I walked to Whyte Ave and went for lunch at the Sugar Bowl with Nicolette. Then we walked the River Valley for over two hours. It was beautiful out today and I am really happy that I did it, but I pulled out my back again. Agh! I really need to bite the bullet and go to the chiropractor. 
I am so sore. Walking for 3 hours wasn't the nicest on my body. I am really exhausted, but I can't fall asleep. I hate this."

So we took more kirlian photographs today in class. Mine were better than the other ones I attempted, but I still had some broken rings. Ekk! But look at all the angel/spirit spots! (the little white dots mean extra positive energy!). The photo # 3, is a kirlion picture of my grandmas locket. On the back of the locket is TO JOAN LOVE JIM engraved. Inside there is a picture of them. AND then look at the two pink dots in the picture. Pink/reddish dots indicate spirits or energies that are dead. The kirlian picture I took after me running up and down the stairs in the school, just proves that my energy flows better when I am more active. 
I still get to take 6 more pictures!! The film is really expensive. It's about $2 a picture. The cameras are $800 for students. I really want to buy one. I think it would be a valueable addition to my future Holistic Practice."

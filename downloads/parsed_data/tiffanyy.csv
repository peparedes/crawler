"event","Whoo hoo, last weekend: Vegas

It was my first time in Vegas being 21 and it was totally fun!  All I did was stick my ass to the gambling machines.  I lost about $80 but not $1 was my money :)  Aww...such nice people to invest in me like that. haha Love you Mom and Dad :) oh! and Grandma too...$20! from her!

Stopped by the outlets of course before hitting Vegas. The Fashion Outlets to be exact right at the borderline.  Since my mom was flying in from Nor. Cal to meet us in Vegas, I had a chance to pick up a Mother's Day present for her.  My mom's been into earrings lately, fancy ones, so I bought her a pair.  I think she'd look really pretty in them :)

I drove the whole damn way to Vegas, okay wait, from a rest stop to the outlets, my dad drove but it was like 30 mins MAX! haha  My dad is the worst side passenger!  He's used to being the driver and everyone pouring him drinks and feeding him while he drives, but he will NEVER do that for other drivers. haha I got yelled at for my speeding (psh 80mph is usual for Vegas roads ok!), my changing CDs while driving, my eating while driving, and my swooshing his cig. smoke away from my nose. haha  It was a loooonnggg 4 hour drive.

We stayed at the Las Vegas Hilton.  This is our O.G. hotel to stay at.  My parents have worked at the Las Vegas Hilton Convention Center for the past 10 years and we have always stayed at the Hilton.  It is kind of like the second home for me everytime I'm in Las Vegas.  I'm so comfortable in their hotel rooms, not saying that I can't be comfortable in the Bellagio or anything *hehe*, but yea I love the Hilton, that's all.

Okay, sooooo did gambling at night with the Dads, which I have ALWAYS wanted to do.  I'm such the Daddy's little girl.  I've been waiting 21 years of my life to sit next to my dad at the video poker machines, not talking, and just playing.  Shit...I even skipped shopping at the Caesar's Forum Shops to play with my Dad!  Ok, so yea after gambling for a few hours, we all went to sleep to be waken up by my sister Julie at 7:00AM!!!! to drive 2 1/2 hours PAST VEGAS to hit Zion National Park in UTAH!!!  WTF?!

After the drive, it was worth it.  Zion was beautiful, pictures to come!  After hiking through this 2 mile trail there was this river/lake thing where everyone just took off their shoes and walked around in the water.  Seems cool right after a hilly hike? noooooooo, the wake was f-in ICE COLD!  It was supposedly melted snow from the mountains over yonder.  My feet almost FROZE!! AND to make it worse, my dad was like ""get in further, I wanna take a picture of you guys!"" argh...

Back to Vegas!  gamble, gamble, gamble.  My favorite words while I was gambling...""Cocktails?"" hehe :) *smile*  I was too tired this time around to do the whole club hopping...but I've got another Vegas trip planned for September...so we'll wait until then :)

That's all folks!"

"event","on another note to my bad day:

1) got a long needed hair cut today.  Only $15! but I had to come home and fully blow dry my hair myself, which I prefer actually bc I save $10 and I can style it the way I like.

2) went to Trader Joe's today and picked up some new food for my new Atkin's Diet.  No or little cards, all protein.  Good idea!

3) I have an interview next monday for a dental receptionist job.  yay! finally something I've been waiting for.  my mom said she'd give me the car too if I got the job.  wish me luck!

4) i've realized that the way that I've been acting for the past few months is normal for someone who has been dealing with a workaholic, so I'm not insane after all.

5) thanks to sandy for just being her."

"event","1.  You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and
    free.

2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you
    feel irresistable is creative, never let you feel bored.

3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is loyal,
    faithful, never change.

4.  You don't like it when your partner is emotional and/or too
    moody; and you don't like it when you don't know how to please him/her.

5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your
    partner is one that you care not only about the present but
    also the future with your partner, a long-lasting relationship
    that you can grow with.

6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything
    wrong after marriage.

7.  You think of marriage as a precious thing.  Once you get married,
    you'll treasure it and your partner very much.

8.  At this moment, you are quite self-centered; you think of love as
    something you can get and trash anytime you want.

DANG! That last one sucks! It's totally off from the first 7!"

"event","whenever I get hurt by someone, anyone, I always re-evaluate myself, sit back and think what I did wrong for this person to want to hurt me.  This time around, I'm confused.  I put myself out there so much, to love other people and care for them.  But when I feel like I'm not getting the same in return, I get sad and daring enough ask them why they aren't returning the same feelings.  I feel selfish for asking, but sometimes I feel like I have a right too, depending on who this person is.  

I'm so tired.  I can't keep playing red-rover waiting for you to call me over when you need me and send me back when you don't.  I wish I had someone that would appreciate me just for me without measuring what I've already done or haven't done.  This is me.  This is all I got.  Do I dare to ask if you still want me?

"event","hello...to whoever reads these entries.  It's Thursday, should've been at work, but got the day off because I was summoned to Jury duty, but bc I won't be available next week (if they call me into a trial) I postponed my jury duty date for a time that I have about 10 days free...Psh! when the hell is that?!  For now, I put it towards the end of summer right before Fall qtr of '03 starts.  The lady at the court house was so nice.  I asked for her suggestion on what I should do (either stay all day today and hope the judge excuses me from jury duty bc Im a student or postpone). She said that if I didnt want to take the risk of the judge NOT excusing me (which means I wouldn't have been credited for sitting at the court house all day) then I should postpone.  I wasn't sure what day I wanted to postpone to so the lady actually gave me her personal number so that she can set up the date and send me my next jury duty papers!  She said that if I called all the other numbers they would give me a lot of hassel! cool huh?!  I felt lucky today.  

So yea, today: no work, no school, no jury duty...this means...SHOPPING!  :) Went to my ghetto local mall (West Covina Mall) and bought three shirts and a pair of capri jeans.  YAY!!  I'm all set for my hang out with my old friends on Friday and Joe's Crab Shack on Saturday!

Hmm, got in a little argument with Alex today.  I honestly hate buggin him at work.  I don't mean too, but sometimes I just get caught up in telling him things that I forget he's at work.  Anyways, for the past few days Alex honestly lead me to believe that he wasn't going to get me a present for my 21st birthday.  Do you know how SAD I've been for the past few days thinking that my own boyfriend isn't going to get me a present?!  *sigh* I did bad.  I tripped out on him today telling him how much I thought it sucked that he wasn't getting me a birthday present and guess what?  His reply (screaming might I add): ""How do you know I didn't get you a birthday present?!?!""  Sheesh, how do you reply to something like that?  Honestly, I DON'T KNOW!  He's been tricking me this whole time and even right now at this moment I STILL don't know what's going on.  All I DO know is that I shouldn't expect Alex to get me anything.  Cuz if I did or do, that'd be selfish of me right? Shit, my head hurts...I'm gonna go watch a few episodes of Sex And The City before I'm off to LAX to pick up my mommy.  SATC always makes me feel better..."

About twelve people are showing up for my bday thing that my sister set up for me!  It'll be lots of fun.  A day before my bday, my HS friends are meeting up with me.  We're driving out to LA (ucla area) to see my friends new apartment.  I love the area around the ucla campus...it's so lively and mainly all walking distance.  Psh, here in Irvine you have to DRIVE everywhere...and if you ain't got a car, ur shit out of luck :)  That will be me next week.  Anyways, excited to see the old friends and elated to see everyone else at Joe's Crab Shack.

The mom is coming home this Thursday.  My dad on the other hadn isn't getting back until mid April I think.  Argh! I keep telling him to come back sooner (bc of the war and all) but nooooooo.  I hope everyone who is flying these days has a safe trip to wherever they're going!

Summoned to Jury Duty this week...ARGH! doesn't that suck?!  Rescheduling it for Spring Break was my fault, but  just plain having Jury Duty! doesn't that suck?!  AND I have to work this week.  I've decided to bust the two weeks notice on my boss this week. (psh, should've thought of that BEFORE Spring Break) but yea, I didn't totally decide until my boss pissed me off last Friday.  Hmm, long story and I won't tell you unless you're in my face for me to do my boss impressions and stuff :)  Anyways, a little worried on how to say it, cuz I've never really quit from a job before.  SHEESH! I'm supposed to be on vacation?! Not being all stressed and shit!

GOtta go to bed now...work calls at 9AM! more to come...*dun dun dun*

p/s: at my apartment all by myself this week :( soooooooo damn lonely!

"event","I notice now that I only come on LJ to vent.  It's a place for me to release my aggressions without people back-talking to me.  I don't care if people read my LJ...it's a place just for me.  My agression today? OBLIGATIONS.  A lot of people don't see the difference between doing something because you're obligated to and doing something because you WANT to.  Take this for an example.  If I haven't heard from a friend in a long time, I'd rather continue to not hear from them instead of getting a call to say hello ""out of obligation"" you know?  Like, call me because you want to say hello because you miss me or want to catch up on how everything's going.  Don't call me because it's been a month or so and it's about that time to call.  It's pointless becaues you end up having nothing to say, you risk those awkward-ass silent moments, and the whole conversation becomes meaningless. 

I've been learning a lot more lately to say what you want, when you want to, without being scared.  It's all about being in the moment.  It's risky to be this way though.  You risk hurting that person you're talking to.  But, with being loud like that, you have to at least set yourself back for a few moments and think why you lashed out like that.  If you have valid reasons, then the person you're screaming at shouldn't be hurt and should set themselves back too and think to see if they're doing something wrong."

"event","last thursday:  I got to take a break from Irvine and visit HOME, (well near home) Rowland Heights with my Chinese Assoc club.  We stopped by Speed Zone (ZzZzz...) then strolled along Puente Hills Mall (ZzZzz....) then walked around Life Plaza (YEAH!)  My friends and I took these sticker pictures at a really cool place.  They're full body sticker pictures and when you're done taking the pictures you run out of the booth and start putting background colors, borders, and writing on it.  It's really cool.  Good idea for a business too!  The whole store is just full of those booths and that's it.  CASH ONLY too...what profit!  All you need to do to save up and invest in those damn machines and ur good to go! For the amount of people that go take those pictures, you'll be making profit in only a few months! 

Last weekend: Watched JUST MARRIED!  That movie is sooooo funny! I haven't laughed that hard at a movie theatre in soo long.  Didn't like the ending very much bc it was really abrupt, but I think ending it abruptly was better then dragging it along.

This week: starting a yoga class! well a bunch of yoga classes, cuz you're allowed try any of the classes they offer.  Check it out: www.yoga-path.com  So far, I've only done two classes, Ashtanga and Pilates.  GOD DAMN THEY'RE HARD!!! ESPECIALLY Ashtanga.  People around me were doing head stands and shit.  The girl said it was okay for beginners to join in and take it slow as long as you feel like you're athletic.  I think I'm pretty athletic, strong in the legs, so I tried it.  Hmm...supposedly if I continue the classes I'll be able to stand on my head! Imagine that! LOL

This weekend: I'm not looking forward to this weekend.  I need to visit Ontario Airport THREE times and LAX one time.  SHEESH!  Do people not understand the rise in gas prices these days?!  As a favor to my sister, I have to pick up her roomate at Ontario in the evening, BUT that morning around 6:30AM (a time that I'm usually still in DEEP SLEEP and DREAMING) I have to drop off Chris and Archie at Ontario.  THE NEXT DAY (Sunday) I have to take my mom to LAX (cuz she's leaving for Shanghai and Taiwan *sad*) and then pick up Arch and Chris AGAIN at Ontario around 10:30pm.  THENNNNN, YES THERE's A THEN...I have to pick up Sandy and drive back to Irvine!  I'm already tired just thinking about it!

While typing away on LJ, I was watching this show about the Worlds Sexiest People?  This show's CRAP!!!  Three judges sit there and rate the person standing before them on sex appeal, face, and overall body.  PSHHH...this hispanic guy was up and I THOUGHT was actually one of the best looking, but the judges said something about how his face wasn't chisled (sp?) enough and how he didn't ""own"" his sex appeal. hahaha WAH?!  What these judges are looking for is the perfect, WHITE male with bonde hair, blue eyes and surfer boy looking.  They only choose the brunette or Asian guy for prelims as a token. (ie: the token black, asian, hispanic guy) *bleah*

I'm tired, my thighs hurt and I just wanna chill and paint with my water colors now.  Any suggestions on what I should paint?  OH YEAH! ONE MORE THING! Whoo hoo! My bday's coming up in exactly 31 days!  And the countdown begins!"

"event","A lot of people have been having these major updates lately. Here's mine...

Hmm what's been going on...I've been having a personal crisis where I've honestly considered therapy.  Yeah, as crazy and whack-ass as that sounds, I really did consider it and actually I still AM considering it.  I'm gonna take the ""one-day at a time"" route at the moment.  Actually it's all I can do right now since I have no clue how to even begin looking for a therapist.  I think I just need people to talk and vent out to.  I don't want any repsonses, suggestions, or advice.  I just want an ear that will let me blabber along without getting a ""Well, Tiff I think YOU"" this and ""YOU"" that.  I don't need people to analyze me, just someone to lend an ear, shoulder, or whatever.  Now that I think about it, I don't need a therapist, cuz a therapist is like paying someone to talk back to you and discuss things with you.  I don't need that.

Moving along, yuck I hate talking about what I just talked about (yea I'm weird like that).  I bought new tweezers!  I lost my good pair (so sad about that...) in Seattle so I've been in a desperate search to replace it.  My new tweezers come from Marukai a local japanese market near my house.  They were on sale (a plus!) and made in japan.  I'm wierd and kind of materialistic like that...i believe that almost anything made in japan is a good buy, only because people say ""made in japan"" stuff are really good quality...true?  My eyebrows have been needing a good tweeze.  I'm too poor at the moment to rush on over to South Coast for the $15 eyebrow treatment.  Tweezing, although sounds nasty and hurts like shit, will have to do for now.

I'm distracted at the moment.  I was on a flow typing away my ""update of updates"" and alex calls.  I feel the need to stop my writing and call him right back so that he doesn't have to wait.  is that a pathetic gesture or a loving and caring one?  I'm gonna pretend right now that it's a loving/caring one and call him back.  *sigh* leaving my readers hanging again...u should be used to that! I've been leaving people hanging ever since I've been with alex. I too quickly got caught up in the romance of the relationship that I've disregarded the need to manage friends and boyfriend. not a good thing <--hence, why I think I need therapy."

I've been foolish these past few months.  Living in a dream, a fantasy that doesn't even exist.  I've been fooling myself to believe that it's all about me and no one else.  I've been selfish and irrational.  I scream, yell, and cry out of anger, frustration, and most importantly love.  I've always been a pretty lucky person and have always had an optimistic view in life.  Unfortunately, this optimism has turned into selfishness.  I've learned to appreciate what comes to me, but disregard my ways towards other people.  My apologies for me and the person I have become.  I hope for everyone to accept my apology and learn to forgive me.  I promise I won't cry."

"event","Had a pretty sad day today, but it ended on a goodnote, and yes I'm ending my day just a little earlier today.  I've been having a bad day because I've been having trouble with confronting a close friend of mine.  I'm undecisive as to if I should even confront the person, scared that they might take it the wrong way.  My only purpose in doing so is to express my feelings because I care and wish only the best for our relationship and also for there to be no grudges held upon each other. *sigh* I'll sleep on it before I do anything.

Last night, or this morning (approx. 1AM) my friend kat and I were bored out of our minds and couldn't sleep, so we decided to take a midnite (?) snack run to Denny's and gossiped for a few hours.  Got home and in bed at around 330am.  I'd be a millionarie by now if I recieved a nickel for everytime I yawned today.  My jaw actually hurts now from yawning.  

Anyways, missed class this morning for obvious reasons but made it to my 1100am class and work @ 1pm.  Work was boring as hell, but I was busy so it went by pretty quickly.  After work I chilled for a few hours, had dinner with kat (AGAIN) then went to work out at the ARC (Anteater Recreation Center) http://www.campusrec.uci.edu/ <--check it out, pretty nice.  Did a little grocery shopping after my workout and actually bought HEALTHY FOOD! *whoo hoo*  

I have TWO favorite diet sodas now.  My #2 choice is Diet DrPepper, and it's true guys, it doesn't taste ""diety"" like diet coke/pepsi.  My #1 choice, a new one on the shelves too or at least to my knowledge, is Diet Chery Coke.  It's sooooooooo good!  And 0 points (for my Weight Watchers fans)!  It totally doesn't taste ""diety"".  I'm happy, with the sodas I mean...I'm actually very tired...neeed sleep now. ZzZZZzzzZzzz......."

"event","Hey Everybody,  Hope everyone had a good weekend.  I sure did.  Had a lot of family time and got lots of red envelopes :)  You know what that means...*grins*  No, just kidding.  Out of all the money I got, I'm probably down to like $10 to spend on myself cuz I had so many bills to pay.  *argh*  I knew I had money coming in so I spent it beforehand with that damn piece of plastic (a credit card, if you didn't catch my drift) haha.  Dangerous little bastards I tell yea!  Anyways, it felt great to be home on Friday.  I love my bed at home.  It's OFF the floor!!! hahaha my poor bed at my apt.  Actually I like both my beds...my bed at the apt makes my room look bigger, a plus when you have the smaller room.  Saturday was a chill day...damn my short term memory is blasted.  I can't even remember what I did on saturday, but today...my family and I went to Chinatown in the heart of LA.  The smog and bums were great *feel my sarcasm?*, but what I enjoyed most was the dancing lions/tigers (??) that went around to almost every store in Chinatown to wish their business for prosperity for the coming year.  My Dad said that just this year, they (the city) made it legal for Chinatown to light firecrackers for the new year.  They were loud, but fun because the only other time I've seen chinese firecrackers was in Taiwan.  And it's not like I can fly over there whenever I feel like it :) So yea, today was fun.

I just got an overwhelming feeling of tiredness...I'm going to bed, long day ahead of me.  p/s:  I've decided to lightly work out everyday as goal for myself to live up to my new year's resolution.  Wish me luck!  

Happy New Years! <--to ya'll Asian people...:)

p/p/s: cute car huh? Yahoo says it's only $25,000 too!

"event","Had a pretty long day today but it ended quite well.  Had work EARLY in the morning today.  For college student time, 9AM is freaking early ok! especially if you sleep at 2AM after writing a boring ass paper.  Anyways, after a loooooong four hours at work, I met up with some actives from the sorority.  They tried to talk me back into pledging again.  After many guilt trips and talks, I've made up my mind that I will not be pledging again.  

I actually went to my Arts Core class today!  I HATE THAT CLASS! I ALWAYS FALL ASLEEP!  But not doing so well on the last quiz pushed me to go today.  It wasn't so bad though.  The professor played a lot of sound and video clips so it made class go by a little faster.  Still boring as hell, but better.  I confess, I did fall asleep for like 15 minutes. haha that's okay though cuz the class was a 1 1/2 hr class, so I was awake for the majority of time.  

After class I met up with Kathy.  We went to Joe's Crab Shack...IT""S SOOOOOOO MUCH FUN!  It's like the fun environment like Hooters, but twice as fun and more family oriented.  During the evening times, EVERY HOUR they turn down all the lights (yes, while ur eating *haha*)  and put on music really loud and all the waiters and waitresses do a dance routine.  My waiter's name was GUSTAVO!  GOD DAMN!  That boy is like a latin lover baby!  *YUMMMMMY* <--I meant the crab...hehe ;)  

Bye guys!"

"event","I've officially depledged from Sigma Omicron Pi.  Although the pledge mom told my pledge sisters that they have until Friday to get me back, I don't think I'm going to do it.  My purpose in rushing for a sorority was to make new friends and find out for myself what a sorority was really like.  I accomplished both in the first week of events.  Being in a sorority takes a lot out of you.  The time and commitment is VERY big and being a 3rd year now, I don't have that to give.  My #1 priority is school, and that's what I'm sticking with.  I'm satisfied with my decision and I have no regrets :)

On a better note, Chinese New Year's is this weekend!  U know what that means?!?! $$$$$$$$$  I'm excited just to be home this weekend.  I wasn't home last weekend and miss my family already!  I'm excited to be back with my mommy and daddy and my sisters!  It'll definitely be a great family weekend.  

PAPERS EXAMS PAPERS EXAMS...that's all I will be talking about til the end of next week.  *argh*"

"event","HI ladies and gents, I had one of the best and well-needed vacations this past weekend.  I spent a lot of quality time with that special someone and loved every minute of it.  Thanks babe.

I just got back from a sorority event.  Today was the first and I'm considering it to be my last.  It was extremely harsh, and at times unneccesarily (sp?) harsh.  I think the anti-sorority feelings I had inside of me during my 1st and 2nd years of college are still inside of me.  Now that I have tried on my own and found out for myself what it's like to pledge/be in a sorority I can judge for myself and u know what?  My anti-sorority feelings seem to have been reassured.

Today's event was ended on a good note and I have a lot of guilt inside of me to NOT let my pledge sisters down.  But, I'm stuck in between that guilt and my own moral/ethical/personal issues.  

No time to think of this now, work tomorrow morning at 9AM sharp!  More on this later.  Let me know how you feel about sororities. (BEYOND THE STEREOTYPICAL VIEWS PLEASE, ESP. THE ONES YOU'VE OVER HEARD!) I'd like to hear from other people, perhaps someone who is actually IN a sorority."

Oh lord...Sandy and I did this for fun, but what the heck?! They actually want us to join?!  hahaha  So, I had until Sunday midnight to call them back to let them know if I wanted to accept, but I go to eager. LOL Sandy called on SATURDAY!  I called this (Sunday) morning.  So, Sandy and I are officially pledging for a sorortiy...let's just see if we can actually MAKE IT now :)  Lemme just tell you, last class...15 recieved bids, only 2 went through the whole pledging process.  Hmmmmm. hahah prepare yourselves to hear me whine about how tired and sleepy I am...let alone how much I'm failing my classes. OK! Off to take a walk with my sis to a local restaurant for brunch."

"event","last night was fun.  The ""surprise event"" for rush week was a scavenger hunt.  Not any 'oL scavenger hunt, but one where we had to drive around Irvine looking for things like a little bag of sand, a traffic cone, a pair of clean boxers shorts, and other hella funny stuff.  Of course, I LOST! *boooo* haha but that's okay, meeting the news girls was fun.  The girl driving the car for my group was so cute, she kept saying ""my car can't accelerate that fast!"" 

Tonite, we're having a more ""intimate"" meeting where everyone is just going to sit around, eat ice cream (which I'm not looking forward to, bc Sandy and I got hella sick off of Westminster Mall ice cream yesterday), and talk.  You know what?  After three nights of rush events, I CAN'T TALK ANYMORE!  My jaw hurts from talking and smiling so much!  Just ONE MORE night of this stuff and it'll be over.  P/S: I'm not excited about hell week (dude, I'm not even sure if there's a hell week...but I bet you there is).

BEFORE tonite's events, I Sandy and I have an interview...goddamn, how much more nerve wracking can they make us?!  It's supposed to be business attire and stuff, so hopefully the questions will also be business-like.  None of those ""how much alcohol can you take?"" questions pleasee!!!!  WISH ME LUCK EVERYONE.  Well, actually now that I think about it, I won't be messed up if I don't get any bids.  I was content with my life before this whole sorority idea thing.  :) *smiles*

School computers and keyboards suck so I'm going now.  Love you all!"

"event","Hello, day number two of rush week is over.  Had a fun time at the social, or wait is it called an exchange?  Ah hell, I dunno.  Anyways, we met another fraternity and the sister sorority from SF State came to meet us too.  We played a game that was kinda like musical chairs, but instead we threw a beannie baby around.  Whoever got the beannie baby had to pick ""something to do"" from a cup.  UNFORTUNATELY, one of the frat guys picked ""serenade a person of the opposite sex"" and at first he began to serenade sandy, me, and these other two girls sitting next to us, but everyone screamed out to only pick one and guess who was sitting right in front of him?  ME!  It was really embarassing, but definately a self-esteem booster.  AH! And guess what?  Sandy had to pick from the cup!  Poor girl, she had to dance like a RAVER!  She did a good job, but boy-oh-boy was it funny!  Good thing she had previous experience from her raver days in high school *hehe* I love you Sandy!

A lot of people came up to me and was like ""oh yea, *nameless boy* is a really nice guy"" and then a *wink wink* came from them and I was totally like, Noooo thankyou.  The boy looked like he was a FIRST YEAR!  and besides I'm happily taken.  WHICH REMINDS ME!

YEAHHHHHHH Alex is coming to visit me!! I'm so excited!  I was extremely excited to visit Seattle for Christmas and visit Alex, but now he's coming down to see me!!  He'll get to see my new room, in which I occupy MYSELF now and we're gonna have lots of fun! *no ineundos intended*!!!  

Alex:  I'm excited for you to come visit me.  It'll be like old times when you used to live down here.  I'm most excited just to be able to spend some much needed quality time with you.  And no matter what happens during this extremely wierd Rush Week thing with the sorority, remember my heart has already been given to you.  I love you...

Goodnite people!  Roomie calling to watch ""Monsoon Wedding""?? Anyone heard of it?"

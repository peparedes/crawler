"event","<span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"">Some of you probably noticed that I basically don't do anything here on my lj except to rant about stuff happening in my life &amp; upload videos like dramas and movies for ipod format. Mainly because I add them in my own ipod and just wanting to share them with others before deleting them off my pc. There is this community which I joined couple months ago that is all about mp4 formats. [ http://community.livejournal.com/mp4all/ ] From videos to music and anything you can think off. The members is around 847 and we're hoping to get up to 1000 members by the end of the year. We're working hard to add more stuff in the community and answering all requests from the members. Sooo..I HOPE&nbsp;you can join this community and help us out. It will be a GREAT advance christmas gift and a great gift to start the new year. ^__^ Onegai! </span></span><br />"

It's going to take a while because it all depends how fast this MU will let me download the videos. The reason I'm putting this on MU now is because....well my hard drive is about to blow up and I don't want this videos to be lost so might as well store it here right? hahahaha Anyways, I'll keep uploading videos here from time to time. I'm uploading Lovely Complex the live-action movie right now, a request from missy, so I'll be doing that throughout this week. Also the movie Virgin Snow..I'm going to upload that too in ipod format. So hopefully all the links will work if not, well just let me know :-D Ohhh yeah, Yukan Club ipod format..ill be doing that too..hahaha Have fun! <br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);""><strong>~*IPOD format*~</strong></span><br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 204);"">Kindaichi no Shonen no Jikenbo (2005) with Kamenashi (KAT-TUN) and Ueno (Nodame Cantable)</span><br /><strong>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=Y7LFITCD </strong><br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 204);"">Yukan Club Episode 5 </span><br /><strong>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7XUD7QCJ</strong><br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 204);"">Lovely Complex part 1 out of 4 </span><br /><strong>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=Z473GQSH<br /><br /></strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 204);"">Lovely Complex part 2 out of 4</span><strong><br /></strong><strong>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=D7T8UETM<br /><br /></strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 204);"">Lovely Complex part 3 out of 4<br /></span><strong>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=MJ0HNC87<br /><br /></strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 204);"">Lovely Complex part 4 out of 4<br /></span><strong>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=YWBJ3J4Q<br /><br /></strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 204);"">Virgin Snow part 1 out of 2<br /></span><strong>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=S7NXTPCQ<br /><br /></strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 204);"">Virgin Snow part 2 out of 2<br /></span><strong>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7Z9P0GKC</strong><br /><br /><br /></span></span><br />"

It'll be around Feb. 19 and 20th at The Orleans hotel and casino. But the crew is staying till the end of feb. Isn't this exciting???!!! I can't believe they will be in las vegas. Of course I'll probably miss it but I really want to see even a glimpse of it. The filming is in public so we can watch. I wish wish wish I could go.. </font></font>"

<i>Ugh.</i>

Gillette flops down on the bed for a good, long sulk.

<i>He was only trying to get a rise out of you with that comment about preferring lads. He doesn't actually know that. And you didn't say anything incriminating. What can he do?</i>

He can't do anything. Bloody pirate. There's no reason to be afraid of him.

<i>If he could tell, other people can tell. Maybe it's obvious, and you just don't know it.</i>

No. Of course it isn't obvious. Nobody's ever suspected him before. If it were obvious, he'd have been court-martialed and flogged for it by now.

""I'm not a bloody sodomite,"" he murmurs. 

And technically he's not. He's never actually slept with another man before.

Though not for lack of wanting to.

Gillette throws his pillow violently across the room. <i>God,</i> he hates Jack Sparrow."

"event","Gillette flops down on the bed and stares at the ceiling for a while. <i>It could be worse,</i> he tells himself, though he's always hated that line of thinking.

At least he's learned something. He closes his eyes, wondering at it all. Revolutions in France? Revolutions all over the world? England and France, at peace with each other?

He likes Shelley. He likes her company, her friendliness, her smile, her stoic acceptance of a situation far worse even than his own. 

He <i>should</i> be attracted to her, more than platonically. He should want to go to bed with her. But he's long since come to terms with the fact that women hold no interest for him, not like other men do. Specific other men. Other men that he hasn't escaped even here.

He sighs. As he's told himself--it could be worse."

"event","Gillette has slept in his share of dusty inns, and this Milliways is the cleanest one he's ever encountered, with the softest, warmest bed.

This does not affect his opinion of the place. He wants out. 

But the only door in his room is the one leading to the hallway. Gillette closes his eyes, clenching and unclenching his fists in a futile attempt to stay calm at the universe. ""<i>Damn</i> it,"" he hisses under his breath, pounding the pillow. ""God <i>damn</i> it. Damn it all to hell.""

He has the nagging feeling that his day is only going to get worse from here. He drags himself out of bed nonetheless, reaching to grab his wig from the table where he's left it, but it isn't there anymore, and neither are his coat and waistcoat.

He feels a dull wave of panic. ""If that bar has eaten my clothing,"" he snarls, ""I'm going to take an axe to it, security or no."" He is not going downstairs without full uniform. Nothing can make him go downstairs without his uniform. He certainly can't very well go downstairs without shoes, at any rate. 

He spies a wardrobe in the corner, and is certain that it wasn't there a second ago. Perhaps whatever ungodly spirits run the place have had the decency to pick up his clothing for him. He tries to be optimistic--always a strain for him, even at the best of times--and opens the wardrobe door.

No uniform. No wig, jacket, waistcoat, stockings or shoes, at least, not the ones he came in with. In place of his uniform is a pristinely-ironed suit of clothes, all in black, with some sort of dark gray blouselike shirt and a belt. The shoes are the most familiar-looking piece of the ensemble, black and shined to perfection as his own always are, but they have laces to them like trousers should, and the trousers do not.

He is going to look like an idiot if he wears this. But then, he's seen other patrons wearing the same sort of thing. And they all look like idiots too. 

Gillette snarls wordlessly at the wardrobe and puts on the clothes. The fastenings are easy enough to figure out, and there is a mirror nearby to help him ensure that he's wearing the clothes the same way the other idiotic-looking patrons are.

The wardrobe has also given him one of those bizarre colorful cravats that hang down the front of the shirt, but he can't figure out for the life of him how to get it to hang that way, so he gives up on it and tosses it into the back of the wardrobe, hoping it's not essential to the outfit. His hair is a mess, but the wardrobe hasn't given him a wig to cover it up, and so he finger-combs it as best he can and sits back down on the bed for a good, long, furious sulk before facing the rest of the tavern again."

"event","Ordinarily, when Gillette opens the door to the officers' tavern, he expects to find himself in the officers' tavern. Not an unreasonable expectation, is it? 

But unless they've refurnished the place in some remarkably ugly style he could never have imagined in his strangest dreams, and unless the Royal Navy has recently inducted a great number of new, unfamiliar, very oddly-dressed officers without Gillette's knowledge, he is most certainly not in the officer's tavern.

He's stepped over the threshold before he can think this over, and when he looks over his shoulder, he sees only darkness where he should see the cobblestone main street and the barbershop across the way. 

Through a brief moment of sheer panic, he wonders if he's dead. <i>Of course you're not dead, lackwit. You were perfectly alive and well before you opened the door, and if you were going to die, you'd have seen something coming before it hit you.</i>

That doesn't help with the panic. He's still trapped in the Tavern from Hell, if it's even a tavern...yes, he sees a bar, and the patrons are drinking, so it seems to fit the definition. 

<i>Haven't I had enough of this kind of thing this week? Yesterday it's invincible skeleton-pirates, today I'm trapped in a magical tavern with no way out...</i>

All he'd wanted to do was drink away his anger at Norrington and Sparrow and go home and sleep off the confusion. Why is he being begrudged that?

He realizes that his usual habit of holing himself up in a dark corner and getting drunk alone is not an option at the moment. He needs answers.

He ventures forth into the tavern, looking for a familiar face."

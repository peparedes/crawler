anyway, here's pictures:

"event","i'm a horrible horrible ljer. 
i'm hanging in there. 
things are mostly decent.
i applied to school.
i've lost 145 pounds.
i'm pretty hopeless over someone i'm super close to (who is pretty much completely emotionally unavailable.)
i've got to get my head straight on this one.
i spend too much time on myspace. not enough on lj.
i have an absolutely AMAZING crew.

my favorite things about today:
joel now lives on my coast and i will be seeing him at the end of september because i'm roadtrippin with some of my ladies.
mia and seth got married. and i got to see pictures. and they're pretty much adorable.

i leave you with??

"event","hmm...so an actual update.

things in my world are good.  i'd venture to say great or wonderful, but that could be pushing it.  i have some really good friends and i think daily about how blessed i am to have them.  bridget visited this weekend and we had a really chill, fun time.   i've been spending a ton of time not at home.  hanging out , going out.  i'm waiting on a job with the school system.  it's a sure thing, but now that it's summer everything has slowed down.  i'm still losing weight, amazingly enough.  i'm feeling really good about that and about myself.  i haven't weighed myself lately, but i know it's pretty significant because of the reactions i'm getting from people and my energy level, forsure.  and there's kind of maybe sorta...a girl.  not anything serious.   i kind of dig her even though she isn't really my type. and we're both scorpios...which is kind of frightening.  i don't know...some days i like her.  some days i'm just frustrated and and i hate her and am all about the FTB.  but it's been forever since i've been willing to even put myself out there at all.  so it's good.

so that what's going on with me in a nutshell...

tomorrow i'm going to try to go camping.

this is so rambly and scatter-brained.  sorry, i'm out of LJ practice.

"event","you have no idea how surreal my life can be sometimes.

it's good, but living with 6 boys is getting really intense.  mainly because 3 of them have been acting like total little assholes.

i'm losing weight like crazy, although i feel really fat today.  fatter than usual.  i think i lost like 20 pounds last week.  insanity.  sometimes i think that if i were to lose all the weight i want to, maybe i'd go crazy.  like, i couldn't handle it or something.  i mainly feel like this when i'm laying in bed at night and i can feel, with my hands, the difference in my body.  the changes that are taking place.  the bones that i ACTUALLY HAVE.  my wrists are smaller, my arms are.  the skin on my legs is looser than it's ever been.  it's gross, but wonderful at the same time.  i know i'm going to need surgery to fix my skin, but i'm not afraid of that.  i rode my bike today for the first time in like 2 years.  i washed it and filled the tires and took it to the park and it was easier to get on than ever before.  i could only ride for like 15 minutes, but that will change. 

i'm getting more motivated to do things for myself.  i'm ready to go back to school.  hopefully next semester.  

i really want a girlfriend.  not need, i'd never say need.  but i think it would be really nice.  i just want someone to talk silly to and be around.  i want closeness and flirting. well i have flirting, but whatever's after that, (it's been so long i barely remember.) i'd really like to have that.  i guess i just want to be wanted."

i gag drinking echinacea and i love japanese exchange students eventhough i don't know why they call them that when i don't get to see japan.  maybe next summer, if i somehow become wealthy in the next year.  and thinner.  wealthy and thinner.  i am losing though, i'm down about 50, which on me, isn't really that much, but its better than nothing.  tonight was bowling with the students.  last night starbucks.  we've been doing starbucks kind of a lot because it's a way to get out of the house, and there really isn't anyplace else nearby to sit and drink coffee and smoke cigarettes.   last weekend i saw the grand canyon's majesty for the first time.  it was pretty majestic.  i have this idea that pretty much no americans go to the grand canyon.  there were only foreigners there.  many beautiful european people and asian people.  i went there on a bus of japanese students.  i had an amazing and fun time. 

tonight:
hookah with the japanese boys.  today was the sayonara party.  in the morning (5 hours from now) we say goodbye.  it's seriously like losing a close friend.  chances are i'll never see them again.  this makes me so sad.  both of them cried today.  in five hours we'll all be crying, i think.  i want to see japan more than i ever have before.

i'm constantly baffled by how quickly time goes by as i get older.  
it seems like yesterday i was graduating from highschool and moving to hawaii <i>(and back.)</i> and driving my dad to dialysis three times a week. 
more, it seems like yesterday that he was answering the phone <i>this is GOD, who's this?</i> and agreeing with michael that the password was indeed ""klondike bar"".
it seems like yesterday we were swimming in the pool and i was sneaking sips of his beer eventhough i thought it tasted like shit. 
it seems like yesterday i was pulling off his socks for him after he'd worked all day. or yesterday that he took me and the boys and my friend jenny schnepp to the LA zoo after stopping at aero market for a box full of sandwiches and bazooka joe bubble gum.
or bringing me chick-o-stix or necco wafers.

i try not to remember any bad stuff, because it wasn't bad enough to damage me.  sometimes he yelled, but he wasn't abusive. he only ever laid his hands on me in the form of a finger poke to the chest. he provided for his family.  he loved my mom. 

he said funny shit, my favorites:
<i>your ass is sucking canal water.
i'm gonna make a foot factory in your fanny.
we're gonna have to go to kaiser to get my foot out of your ass.
well, we could always open a whore house and run it by hand til we get some girls.</i>

he thought he was funnier than he actually was. maybe that's where i get it from.

the first night (thursday) i camped by myself.  i was not scared.  until the next morning when i found out that they found a HUGE rattlesnake at the campsite next to mine just the day before.   friday, after much frustration and misery and driving to every campground in 100 mile radius looking for a place to camp, i asked my dad (and dorothy the parking space angel) to help me find a campsite at my favorite place in the whole world and i ended up with the best spot in the whole campground.  

i spent the weekend with good friends and i enjoyed myself more than i have in a really long time. 

in spite of a middle of the night toilet over-flow and the rocky start, it was just incredibly amazing.  seriously.  i got just the right amount of sunburn 
and spent just the right amount of time on the beach 
and we were just the right distance from the bathrooms and just the right distance from the shore 
and i ate just the right amount of junk food 
and just the right amount of kite flying

i feel like we're not ready to go.  i KNOW i'm not. i still haven't packed and my room is a HOLY MESS.  and i really should clean it before i go and i need to do a load of laundry still and i know i'm going to forget something...like how to drive or something equally important like omg i have this mental picture of us all running around like crazy people and then accidently leaving someone home alone like macaulay culkin or something.  i should go.

wish me luck."

"event","so mission possible weekend is when my whole church gets together and chooses several different projects to help out our community.

some people work at food kitchens, some people put together groceries for people who need them, some people worked at the children's hunger fund, some cleaned up the trail that goes in front of the church, some made a back yard at a halfway house in to a garden, some made meals in a bag, some (my group) visited the shadow hills convalescent home.  it's just cool to see all the things that get done when everyone does something at once. you know?

i really enjoyed myself.

this is my friend alice, with a stick.  i love her because sometimes she comes to church, in her church clothes, on saturday.  when i went to triennium (when i was like 16) she gave me $20 and told me to buy myself a souvenir but not to tell the other girls because she didn't give them any.  :)  also one time she told me that i was the only person she'd ever met that constantly has an orbit of people around them.

"event","Awww....Last night was  crazy i had a wicked good time.... lets see

Don't worry about the day....I don't want to write about it really....


Came home took a shower got on some pimp threads and took the train to Jens house to meet the girls there I love when you look wicked nice all dressy and people around u are thinking whoa he must be important or doing something kool.... LOL!! any ways got there and the girls were getting ready in Jens room, LOL u know how they are so i sat and played Supernintendo and it made me think of her :( i remember when she said she loved Sonic and all the oldies I got every game for her and just sat back and watched her play them for hours at end... just laughing I wanna just go aday with out thinking of her but thats like not breathing shes always on my mind not just from time to time but every second of every day.... when i find her hair in my Brush, clothes she left behind her fav pillow, the pictures the letters the words exchanged for one another the long nights the neighbors banging on the wall to make us be quite.... the sitting back and sipping on rum n coke.... the long night walks  even in the cold u still came out with me...

Anyways the girls came out and my jaw must have dropped or something they looked like models D looked cute Ive never seen her in a dress shes always been a pants  skirts and shit.... she just looked at me she had a glossy eyes or something they probably took a couple shots before i came to get them started... I was told Jen I couldn't even see her underwear line that dress isn't a dress its Ur skin its so tight.. she was like ""oh ya  no underwear will do that giggle"" lol HAHA i just had to laugh about that.... well the limo came around 6:30 or so and we jumped in Jen brought this big bag i didn't know what it was but it was like abook bag.... turns out it was some drinks if ya get what I'm saying.... the limo guy had champagne glasses and we poped the corks and i poured the first glass :) i needed it i was so fucking nervous I haven't been to a club since fucking MD with D and my friends.... LOng time ago... so we all were just having fun wasting time drinking we arrived at the club and before we got out D said to me ""tonight were your girls so take care of us don't let any big black boys try to rape us LOL!!!"" so the guy opened the door the Lady's got out first and then i did i was so scared I'm nervous some times for no fucking reason i cant tell ya why fucked up in the head,,,,, oh well we gotta in n the girls ran directly to the dance floor Jen drug me i didn't really want to i wasn't feeling it, i couldn't get lyssa off my mind to the point id just stand there in the middle of the girls an go blank.... but then i started to have fun they took my mind off it... they said have fun were leaven soon.... so i was dancing the girls dancing with each other and me i was getting gang banged by them i couldn't stop laughn,... you could see D get mad when i would dance with Ash and it wasn't my intention i knew ash wasn't really a club person so i wanted her to have fun too she prob felt left out... JEN Was gon crazy...at one point she was grinding  and picked up the back of her skirt and her ass was just a little shown and she knew it too and she couldn't really care.... HAHA it was funny...there were these guys across from us just watchn us and talking shit probbably... they tried coming over to dance with Jen and T but they  just kicked them aside and were like were here with our man.. and pointed to me LOL I WAS laughing so hard then... probably a nervous laugh...OH so much shit happen that night i cant remember it all happened way to fast... i remember a point when D and ash went to the side and were talking for like 10min about some shit aw the night was long the day even longer doc appt everything the shoes were killing me my head was hurting because I couldn't get her off my head....

you ever notice girls drink for diffrent reasons then guys... well some times... I could tell the girls were tryn to get hammered so they wouldnt care what they were doing and they were just having fun LOL and ya gotta like it trust me i thought it was funny....I didnt even have 2/4 what they had i jsut needed it cause i was nervous...and needed to stop the thoughts in the head.... :)

Long time ago some one said something to me and it stuck with me it probably got me through this year and gave me hope for something so good...now that person gone...i wont forget what she did and how she made me feel,I care so much...I.....her i don't wanna say the word it only brings pain to the brain right now its just to hard...


Thanks to my friends for being there for me, caring and continuing to care... U all know shit that others would kill to know or would freeze in shock...nd i hope u respect that...


I'm tired now i gotta go there leaven soon o i don't wanna miss them leaven wanna make it worth there wild for coming here...


peace to next time.."

"event","sorry don't know what to name the subject and we are listening to Biggie through out the house...long day not to long but pretty long not much up with me i chilled with my friend in Salem today for awhile cause I haven't in along time cause her BF is freaking crazy cause the guys EX cheated on him with a guy named John.... LOL thats the stupidest reason.but ya we chilled she went to the docs with me lol she made me go to the follow up... D wanted to go real bad to ""be there"" for me  but i really didn't want her there cause ya... long ass story and I'm not about to spu it out of my mouth... it was scary lol some what at least.... I got some results that were aahw not to good but could be worse but still up there with cancer i think i have to do research on it and go to a doc....Im glad i had someone there for me just to look back and see the face of a friend there ya know that she had my back....after words i dropped her off then went to the beach for n hour and sat there on the beach  with D on the phone i was planning to come over but i just needed some time to my self ya know to clear the thoughts....things are start to boil over with these girls I think that D self ""loves"" me like she says  and has feelings with me and Ash deff does she wont stop taking pics of me... and the girl keeps taking my hat and wearing it ya know us thugs LOL! I sat there and thought....

one more chance one more chance to meet that person i thought i did and thought she was down to ride... but the tires got flat and the girl jumped out and decided to walk to her friends if you get my drift... I never layed down laws like jealous guys do the ones she says she hated the ones that hadbad coke habits and hit her and slept around and all the crap let her  cry her self to sleep I was always there like air you cant get ridd of me its obvious that  to others that it didn't mean a thing to her....Love was the hook boo at first i didn't want to believe it or accept it if i could id probably put a door on my ears so nothing could get in this brain and stop it from functioning... Its like I wanna be able to say she didn't have a effect on me that i wasn't in love she was just some girl I hooked up with and had a good run but then i think about all the times we had having fun just laying there talking doing the stupidest things but we had fun doing them all the 6hr convos on the phone tell the sun came up.... the all nighters that left my bed soaked in sweat...all the dreams i had of her and when i was lonely and having a bad day i could just day dream of her and it would pick me up like i could fly...probbably why i called her the blue eyed angel... i wish this was a physical cut that i could just put a band aid on but its not its deep in there deeper then any thing.... I'm here with out her and shes still on my mind... even when these hot horney willing girls are around me all the time now.. and all i can think about is you and me.. it sucks truely.... I guess it wasn't to be, i guess she doesn't think about me....Im gonna have to move or chain up my closet... it was are place i remember laying in there watching her draw these pictures while we drank and it made me thank god I found some one like this... WHO else can say that  ya know that there little secret place was their closet? my girl never wanted diamond rings  not a thing she was a strong independent women that loved to work and loved me most of all but as time goes on and shes effected by the wear an tear of society and the Seasons change she changed the cute girl that lite up my room on the darkest nights faded...I sat there on the beach and drew in the sand and i wrote John+lyssa and the tide came in and just took it away like that kinda how she was tooken away.... maybe there was something i could have done or didn't do... maybe i was to nice of a guy i let my guard down and the fire inside of me dwindled down to a spark............Maybe i wasn't there for her, then it hit me i remember standing in her room and seeing all these pics of her partying and these peps.... it hit me IT hit me so hard i feel back and sank in to the sand...these pics of all her summers in NH and were ever partying and what not all the guys she had on the wall the girls... it was as iff she needed these peps there to look at her be there....I remember how she set up a little wall side for me just me with my  writings and pics of me but now I'm just another picture on the wall for her to point at..... she knew me she could say ya we dated for a while.....

I remember when I first started to date her i wouldn't let people know not that i was like embarrassed or anything and when people came up to me and asked like this girl named china would ask are you too in love? are you are you? id say Auh not sure shes kool....because that was my old side the side that couldn't let people know i cared soe much for a girl or anything because they could hurt her to hurt me....I remember the night she said I love you to me...she said she had something for me all night but then wouldn't give it to me i begged and begged she gave it to me and looked away... i sat in shock like studying ever inch of every letter like they were buildings standing tall..it scared me so bad cause i wanted to scream to the world I LOVE THIS GIRL!!!!!!!! but i didn't i told her soon after... wonder if she remembers that too? we didn't tell anyone for the longest time about it but it slept a couple times when i made her laugh and she was like ""i love you babe and quickly covered her mouth.."" her friend Amy looked in shock....LOL

why is it that anyone close you allow close hurts you always... they might not mean it but they do or think there doing the right thing but it HURTS you.... D said to me ""I know you I know you better then this girl if any girl knows you its me, Ive been there through everything the crap with your mom the shit you went through the cops the school stuff the peps that were out to kill you the fun and the bad.... I didn't run from it  i stood my ground cause i care about you.... She doesn't i hope u can see that, man the first time you all went on your break she was out PARTYING The next night doing what she pleasaed.... and she  is doing it again... why do you put up with it you got a stable chick who's down to ride with you right here in front of you"" the fact is i dint know why i don't she has a point some what but its not there like it might have been 3-years ago


I must have been here to long way to long my feelings are dead fuck the hood fuck the trailer park fuck everyone who had ever hurt me let me down shat one me picked on me you don't know me... even D doesn't no one does  I'm sorry I'm not the chump who's out getting bitches to suck on my dick the second we go on a break... ""well she did"" ya she might have but thats her not me..... I thought we both had the understanding that wasn't kool but i was wrong....

Sorry I'm in a bad mood tonight got a little tipsy after the doc's i was in a bad mood after words i wish i was walking down the street and caught in a drive by I'm not scared to die if i die and get to gods gate and he says hey... Ill shoot the fucker in the head and say thanks for the pain bitch feel mine....Some shots are gonna go off tonight....


I called her my angel who was behind me down to ride down to hide the gat or the strait, the one sitting by the phone waiting for me to call and when i forgot or got caught up in it shed hunt me down... but i guess i was wrong.....the only angel behind me is the words on my back....

some one once said to me ""alchol ease the pain and there right it blocks the thoughts of what bothers you so sit back and sip on the yak..""


She always thought of others specially peps she called her Friends... but never about what the girl wanted what she really wanted....some people live day by day the way i used to think but its not right.... she has so much potential she had Jobs Getting her GED and all these things plans and everything but all has gone to the back burner like me.... for a short fun trip, something that wont last...

I remember when she said I'm 17 i should be having fun n crap... your right you should be but guess what the kids Ur having fun with mostly have a plan at the end of summer were they gonna be? college.... that piece of paper... and you could have had it to but in the forum of a GED and been in rolled in college if you wanted to the time everyone else was you could have had a car a place and most importantly ME....

by the way did i say I'm here to stay.. i just want to say it shes probably not reading but baby i need you so and i hope you need me too.... its driving me insane... I will bring you flowers in the RAIN... you know that.... if one day I went away and didn't return would you break down and cry... if you opened the paper and saw me on the granet page (obituaries) would you shed a tear would you care? would you say i never got to say what i wanted to say...?


I swear i sound so gay... but when your in love it doesn't matter....myfrineds might get mad but fuck them then...


when can i see her again when can my heart beat again when does the pain never end.. .ya there may not be tears coming down but I'm still the clown with a fron....

it bugs me my mind doesn't stop it just goes and goes i get so pissed i wanna punch my head tell it stops i don't sto thinking  about everything down to the last hair.... people say that it was only 6months thats nothing but people don't get how we felt every second was a day every min a week every hour was a month and every day was a year.....I remember when she said you know my body...




Doesn't matter what we do as long as I'm with you never felt like this before you keep me coming back for more... i think about the first time we met and i wont forget.... the first kiss  me canceling the SAT's for you...THe call the next morning from your girl... you bounced and i was on heaven the hole day in to the night... when I'm with you.....


So ya now we are done unloading my brain of shit and ya lets get back to my day i left the beach feeling Betta i guess some waht... i said its me time not her its about ME! so i wennt home showed up and got spiffy pimped out  went in to Boston and we all bounced to a party and we were all having fun.. playing some game it was kool the girls stayed next to me i looked like a pimp and they were my hoes..LOL!!! id pimp them out be like 6$ you can have 1...HAHA but ya they all made me wicked comftable... i never told them what happen today its better that way i guess.... we went back to Jens place and decided to just Chill there i was feeling my self ya know I felt on top of the world,but in the car this song came on remember it so vividly it went like this ""you get me lifted swifted higher then a ...fan...""i don't know now my brains shut down drinks ya know... well ya i thought of her and wondered whats she doing....

It bothers me so much to know shes probably having fun right now and she probably talking to guys probably kissed some one probably done somthing... but its ok we are broken up shed sy...... some one through a rock at my head...

LOL!!! I GOT A STATE TROOPERS HAT! MY friend got it for me she used her tittys to get it i guesss.... or her carm any way i got a real one with the badge..... and all.... awww well i need to go grab another drink my throat is getting dried out,,,, the nights not over yet just getting started i guess you can say..... we all came back here to chill my brother is so fucking funny.... since he changed meds hes totally different for the better HES SO SOCIAL AND FUNNY!!!! like i remember him... they said he reminds them of me.... me now or how i used to be....



AW!!! tomorrow we going to the matrix iguess this club they got the hole night planned out i think there getting a limo HAHA!! Jens got the money.... just to make it special i guess..... they said that ill be the hottest guy there with 4 girls on my arms....LOL hope i have fun....time to get the glow sticks and pixy sticks as Jen says.....


Her memory remains locked in my brain the last kiss the 2am call i got her saying this was it....

I was feeling better i guess...Some hope was given to me then snatched away once i got home tonight to change... but ill talk about that lata... lets unload some shit on my mind K?


why cant i breath? why cant i sleep? can she? does she think of me? what am i doing right now?... it all plays back in my head over and over us lying on the bed starring at one another, just looking me gazing in to her eyes seeing nothing but blue skys... everything fades away just the too of us in our own zone.. never left alone the back ground music playing (KC/JOJo-all my life)...watching you looking at me my hand begins to heat...should I give it ot her? i ask my self over and over her smile reassures me I pull it out in front for her to see to how that what is mine...I open the box and time stopped he smiles and a star twinkled in her eye i asked her would she wear it and be mine..... i remember saying "" Aly$$@ M@E G#$#$$N WILL YOU MARRY ME>>> SHE SAID YES AND GAVE ME A KISS>>> (""baby>>baby>>>baby ""kc?jojo"") now its over my hear returned to my shelf hidden from the world..... never to be seen agin....


When i was young i learned not to show emotions it only hurts you... I would walk around acting like nothing bothered me bottling it upinside.....love whats love, ya I hated the word and feared the word... Everyone who used it around me hurt me or was hurt by someone who said that to them... I never used it not even with a serious girl i dated for a long long long time.... i ran from the word you said it to me id flick you off even today when a friend said it I flicked her off..I learned that with out taking risks for something you c are so so much about there would be no way to know....I hope that makes since.....I took a risk and was hurt...The sad thing is i thought from what Ive talked about to her was that we both felt the same... her dad mom cousin ex's all have hurt her so so badly and we were both scared....She said it first  i remember like it was yesterday... HAHA that sounds so gay i hate when i talk like taht.... anyways... ya 


OK what did i do today....hmm  and just what i didn't want to happen happened.... The damn peps spent the night i crashed out cause it was so freaking late like 4am maybe 5am sun was up.... I grabbed the shower first and took a quick one....the girls all took one too which i didn't want them to girl hair every where and shit all in the drain.....I bet D went through my stuff in the bathroom to see if the girls stuff was still around... but i didn't ask.... i could just tell.... we all went to D&D got some food... ice coffee for me... made me wanna puke every sip....why was it when her got one and i took sips i loved it maybe because her lips touched it? or something else who knows... anyways we went back to there place and they all got changed...i checked my mail nd shit.....wrote alittle....talked to some good friends....we talked for a while in the living room and it got to be about the word love i was arguing with them all about it... and how it does nothing but hurt people and give them hope for nothing...D got wicked upset and left the room she was crying t just looked at me and nodded her head to go.... so i left... i went to see her and we talked for awhile... I'm getting the feeling she still has something for me i don't know what and I'm not sure if i do want to know....and she told me not to talk about it with Ash....we came back me giving her a piggy back ride... HAHA she needed it i remember my bro used to do it to me when i was pissed..i dropped her on the couch and then they all tackled me and were like u might be scared of love Jon but were not ""we love you"" as a friend of course D was resident at first to pile on us but then she did not like shes fat the girl weighs like what 130-135max.... or maybe mor I'm not good haha... we all got up and i chilled with D and ash for a hour cause Jen and T wanted to go get some shit......... they did we chilled i sat on the counter ant watched them wrestle and talk and watched TV...it was like i was up high on a nother plain and could just watch my friends have fun...ask looked back and winked at me for no fuckin reason....well we chilled some more i just sat there thinkin.... like i freaking always do...

there was this song that me and lyssa always used to sing for no freaking reason... we couldn't figure out were it came from but we both knew it... well like 3 sentence of it.... it was like
""baby its cold out side""
""baby its cold out side""
""baby don't go"" oor mthing its gone now...

well ya all i could think was about that for some reason... I wish she was here right now... so i could hug her but ya.....

a friend called my cell and it was a female friend of mine named Tina and D answered my phone... she got mad u could see but for no freaking reason..... they both walked away and were talking i think they might have thought it was lyssa... but who knows...

we chilled... went to the beach for a while i sat there and just starred at the water as the girls sun bathe and chated...Jen wouldn't stop looking at me it was kinda scary... with a smile on her face... all i remember was ""iknow iknow"" and the rest i couldn't hear maybe cause i didn't want to... the coolar started to get low on DRINKS and so we left....not before Ash and D got in the water and took there tops off lol i wish a cop came up and was like FREEZE i would have died laughn...I really didn't even notice i was still starring in to the water....we got back to my place and they all met my bro he was wicked cool and are conditioner works now thanks to us..... and the huge hole in the wall!!!we no longer sweat like pigs in my room.... oh well we went swimming sat in the tub for awhile and then t and Jen left us so we decided to go get D a real swimsuit cause she had been wearing Jens extra one and or her bra and panties.....you couldn't really tell from my point of view but some mom did and said something about it.... so ya.... we chilled some more....I came home with them and Ash jumped right on my comp like she owned it or something and was doin shit D came over and then they called me from down stairs....i came up and saw a message from lyssa that sank my my reaming heart to the pit of my stomach... it was like my hears transmission just dropped and the heart ran in to a brick wall and caught on fire....it was something along the lines of ""it only takes a minute to get a crush on someone.....an hour to like someone....and a month to love someone.....but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. *lyssa*""
&
""love begins with a smile,grows with a kiss,and ends with a tear. *lyssa*""
they wre like I'm sorry dude... shes telling you its overOVER! the END! the tear as fell...
I wanted to die my face turned white and my eye began to shake...i looked over at the pics on the wall... and just starred.. I sat down and was like what? they came over to me and put there heads on my shoulder and were like you need to say good bye...say it say it....""shes out doing stuff..."" ""she not thinking of you dude say goodbye to the bitch...""

I have to go I'm out  maybe later Ill finish it.....Im walking to the bridge peace...."

"event","My friends decided to come down, well one in particular a old friend that I thought was mad at me but turns out she wasn't and hopefully shell help me this week...I don't know what to do these days my mind wonders my hearts transmission has dropped to the pit of my stomach and my eyes are no longer a vibrant mirror of fun and laughter, I need something good in my life as the moments pass and she hasn't returned or attempted to I fell further away from that... My friend says ""its for the better shes out having fun getting what ever she wants and its probably something you don't want to know, but you need to know if you get my driff"" ""If some one truly cared as much as I do for you john they wouldn't put you through this... and then not even care one fucking bit."" 

But my friend D doesn't know how when i go to bed i can still feel you breathing and its keeping me awake... so i toss and turn and urn for your return...

D said ""shes moved on its quite obvious and why don't you then she doesn't want to be with you cant you see i know....."" i guess with the hours passing and i get nothing from the girl i am slowly letting go of her hand and drifting in to the water and letting the waves take me away...

the sad thing is and she probably doesn't even get it or remember is when we used to write letters when we first got in the relationship we both told each other how we have been hurt so many times and didn't want it and we were scared to get close for the longest time I was I couldn't put her in my ""circle of trust"" and then i did and the girl just shits on it and couldn't be effected by it and just walks away to party.... I only know what i know....


Remember when at the bottom of the letter u said I cant say i wanna say i love you but i know I'm falling in love with you I'm scared of the word and i know it scares you so much more but Ive been hurt by my dad,cusin,friends,boyfriends.... I hope you wont...

I guess you were right I didn't you did to me....

Lets see what I did to day the girls got here at like 8 i think jumped on my back when i was sleeping scary awaking i thought i was in prison or something i took them to reds... LOL because i didn't want to have to do dishes if i cooked for them.... they dropped me off and went to my friends Jens house to unpack and get some sleep it was a long drive... i did the 3s's shit shave shower.... and feed my dog, got my threads on and booked it to there house.. i got there and we chilled laughed had some fun... reminisced on old days gone by the time i was chasing a rabbit and got the shake on mezzz...hersey park all the old good times....WE chilled for a while then went for a walk I think Jen and Tia smoked bad bitches ;) cause they were a little goofy maybe cause they haven't seen each other in like a year.... girls go figure.....came back to her place i skated out side while D and ash chilled on the steps and watched and we all talked.....D decided she wanted to come back to my place and chill some one on one talking i guess LOL! took the train home and then i got home took a shower cause i was all stinky D brought a 12pack i guess she got from her sister... we chilled went to the pool for a few then  came back here D was a little loopy and all uppdy i could tell she was having a good time i guess... I couldn't get this girl off my mind... D kept getting upset when id say something or look over on my wall were her pics were..... she sat down and put her hand on my lap and said to me dude shes gone...she doesn't want you shes a party chick... when are you gonna listen to the people that care most about you... I got upset i wanted to slug the bitch and dig a hole in my back yard and shove her there.... but I didn't I put the girl on the back burner some would say and told her to throw me one and we just chilled reminisced on good old days... what Ive been up to what are my plans hers whats her love life like and all the bullshit.... we decided to go for a walk on the train tracks and just keep walking i wanted to just keep walking like walking away from somethings like an explosion of fire that was behind me and i just had to fucking walk ya know? probably not... we saw a couple skunks it was killa she got a pic of them on her celly...we came home and she decided to use my comp and was going through my shit... she thought i didn't know but i knew... she talked to Jen on line for a while i sat and just looked at the half pic i have...Long story....and the heartlands that was given backtome...........Why do people hurt others its not right its like they get a high out of it......D was probably on her 10hinne when she couldn't really walk that good hot tub does that to you... and so I walked her to my bed and she ploped down and was scwurmin and i guess Jen told her about how they crashed at my place one night and that i wouldn't chill with them in the bed....she was like there was room u silly boy u... i guess she didn't tell D about the other half with her trying to grab me while i was sleeping on the couch....we sat there her laying down me just looking down at her talking talking talkin..... D reached out to me with her hand but i couldn't I was just not feeling it so i sat down on the couch and kept talking D Begin to cry so i comforted her patted the back and sat there with her.. she put her head on my lap and couldn't stop crying i didn't know what to say i just said dude whats wrong......and she looked up with her mascara running and said you don't know..... you don't remember...... I didn't  i was like what the fuck is this bitch talking about....she wiped her tears and got up nd sat against the wall on my bed n had a evil stare like she wanted to stab me... but it wouldn't have hurt Ive been stabbed a nu ff this week....we went back out for another walk this time to the beach she was dragging ass it was so funny....I couldn't stop laughing we jumped on this old boat and were looking through it it was a re ck boat i guess it was kool you could tell peps have been on it before us.......I couldn't stop thinking about the girl though... I was like what the fuck..... shes probably out getting blasted having fun dancing doing what ev... and your walking around with a hot chick who's drunk and can easy be attained and u dont.... whats your problem....dont you remember what she did to you..... But its passed we came home and decided to watch a movie something scary We always oved watching them....Tia kept text in D for some unknown reason probably planning something or asking how i was.... truthfully i don't know how i am..

the last thing that stuck in my head that D said before she passed out... was ""start thinking about your self dude, your important non of thees HOES, you need someone who knows you and can take care of you and wants to be with you... you told me once along time ago you shouldn't go to bed upset.... even when you are trying to be mad at the person you  should be happy just to know there there... can you say that jay?"" i wanted to die right then what hate hell do i say i just  walked away and sat at my comp while she watched TV and passed out....ASh,T,Jen should be here soon i don't know what else we are gonna do tonight if anything I think Hampton tomorrow or maybe MAINE!!!!!


AWWWWWWWWWW fucking A Jen freaking mentioned this club in Boston called the matrix and now all of them want to go this Friday if t can take off work..... they are trying to drag me there.... they were like you will look like the hottest pimp there with 4hot girls by ur side..... Its probably cause Jens X will be there and she wants to make him jealous but who knows? I'm tired so so tired of drama.... She said shed let it go and we could be friends, but shes a kool person and i cant blow up and break her heart I have to let her down easy so she doesn't snap and be like all of you get out.... she was nice anuff to let them chill there so i didn't have 3 girls running around in my house all tiein up the bathroom no hot water me sleeping on the floor and shit y aknow? eating my food..... plus her place you can have fun.....

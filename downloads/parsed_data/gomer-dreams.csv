<i>This time, I saw myself in a living room that looked sort of similar to one we had while in Casper.  I was with two girls, one of which I was very close to.  I could tell that because we were practically making out in front of the other girl</i> <b>(Note: I NEVER do this in real life.)</b><i>, who was encouraging us.  Next thing I know, a THIRD girl walks in as though she's come home from work or shopping and starts complaining about something trivial about the house.  After that, I woke up.</i>"

"event","This all just came to me the other day, out of the blue.

Now, let me just say right now that I'm <i>not</i> 100% sure about all this.

Interp. is in italics.
<i>Those three dreams from the previous post could be connected somehow.

The first dream could possibly represent my past.  The big city possibly could represent Orlando.  The elevator and my searching for my home might indicate things being a bit shaky (for example, my visit to the ER) and my trying to find a place I belong.  The group of guys around the girl and how I got alone with her could possibly represent how I met Jill, since when I met her, I had the girl next to her move out of the seat so I could talk to Jill.

The second and third dreams might tell of either what should've happened (had I not f@#$ed things up) or what <b>could</b> happen.  Moving in and Jill being there might mean that either we were supposed to move in together at some point or we're supposed to go through some really rough times together before moving in (which explains why I stopped myself from asking to join her in the shower).

The final dream could mean that Jill and I were/are supposed to be together, along with Carla and Chris... even so much as to be very close to each other.  Going by that, one could assume that Carla and Chris are supposed to be a part of my life, regardless.

Something else came to me today.  It's also possible that the woman in question isn't Jill, but someone who will make me feel the way that she did.</i>

Now, Nikki told me that I should try and call Jill.  I'm considering doing that.  The only problem is I'm not sure if the number I have for her is still the correct one.

Any thoughts?"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Dream 1 - A Futuristic Graceville?"">
<font color=""#ff0000"">I found myself somehow in the future, where Graceville had grown to a booming metropolis. I remember going into a building and trying an elevator, finding that it liked to shake things up a bit (that is, it'd go up and down over and over again all on its own)...at least until I pressed a button.

The next thing I knew, I was searching the city for where my house used to be when I came upon a bunch of thugs harassing this girl. I stepped in and got her away from them and she and I were about to have a conversation when I woke up.</font>

<lj-cut text=""Dream 2 - Moving in with Jill?"">
<font color=""#800080"">In this dream, I had my own place, which was a combo of my friend Tonia's place and one of the apartments I lived in while I was at Disney. Apparently, I had just moved in and I wasn't alone. I couldn't see her features real clearly, but my senses told me that it was Jill who was there and wanting to take a shower... I don't know why she was there beyond that reason, though. Anyways, when she asked I thought about asking if I could join her, but then I thought better of it... Whether it was because one or both of us had a significant other, just starting a new relationship, or something else wasn't made clear. Either way, I then went into the next room to get on a computer, which is where the dream ended. </font>
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""Dream 3 - Two for One Deal, Maybe? or Why Does Jill Show Up In My Dreams A Lot?"">
It (They) started out with me talking to a gal I haven't seen in about five years or so. Her name's Dasha and she was a foreign exchange studen from Russia. Really skinny and a little taller than me. Anyways, after we talked for awhile, I saw the both of us sitting on the floor of what I could describe as something like a church van, sans seats. It was daytime.

The next thing I saw was a place that looked similar to our living room and I was snuggling up with what my senses told me was Jill (didn't see her face). Across the way, I saw Carla and a guy next to her that I presumed was Chris. They weren't lovey-dovey like Jill and I were, but you could tell there was something wonderful between them. And I believe my mom was in between us, too. That's the last thing I remember.

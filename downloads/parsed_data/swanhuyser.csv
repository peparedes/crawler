"event","Last night someone I know implied strongly that if he were to have a child, it would be ""everything he was afraid of"" if that child turned out to be a transvestite. The conversation immediately followed his girlfriend's performance in which she appeared as a caricature of the constellation Orion, with moustache, leisure suit, and huge dildo in her pants. What the fuck is wrong with people? Another friend sometimes uses a ""Chinese"" accent for laughs, and the play I saw also featured a man in what can be described as ""brownface;"" he spoke Spanish, wore a tourist's sombrero and serape, and yes, brown makeup. Although his role in the play was to delight a white woman by carrying her off and making her dreams of ""Mexico"" come true, which was somewhat funny. She looked so happy! It was the same woman who played Orion. I guess it doesn't surprise me when my self-proclaimed ""neocon"" friend (yes, he's my friend) tells me that at his job, he threw away some people's resumes because they showed ""ties to known terrorist organizations,"" because that is at least not hypocritical. But when I'm standing on the street with a bunch of freaks about to watch an illegal sidwalk show, and most of us have just seen the abovementioned play, I get mad. What are we/they thinking? And why are these my friends?"

"event","On the eve of my friend's wedding, I'm for some reason laughing a lot. Maybe I'm just happy as a result of regular exercise? But also, I'm reading a totally silly and possibly fucked-up book called ""Tremble and Ennui"" that cracks me up. It's mean, pro-alcoholic, and decadent. It's printed in a very small book format by Coat Pocket Press so I can read it on the train, which paves the way for opportunities to accidentally laugh out loud on public transportation, surely one of the insignificant joys of being human. Anyway the book reminds me of my friend the groom, as does my other reading, ""The Road to Miltown"" by S.J. Perelman. This was written around 1950, and it's satirical essays about what the fuck ever; one is about visiting a man who writes copy for soda fountain menus. Also funny is my neck pain, because I laugh at myself when I can't turn my head on account of this situation's inherent slapstickiness. Other funnies: my cat is old, I just discovered ""Kelly"" of Shoes fame, and then there's Sandra Oh on TV. Besides, I take dance classes where if you do it right, you look like a super foxy burner mama, but if you do it wrong as almost everyone does, you look fucking 'tarded. I break into inappropriate laughter almost every class. The new book of lists from McSleezy's is intermittently funny and so is Bitchfest. My soon-to-be married pal used to call me a bitch a lot when we were teenagers; thankfully this now also makes me laugh."

"event","I'm really into owls at the moment. One of my favorite artists, Mitsy Avila Ovalles, taught me that owls are often called ""tigers of the air."" And now I see them everywhere. Not real ones, unfortunately. But I am happy with representations, almost all of them. There's an apartment near here with a huge weird display of thousands of owls, plastic, stained glass, macrame, wood, everything. I'm also becoming the world's laziest birder, since I really, really love looking at whatever birds are outside whatever window I can see out. The pigeon flock in my neighborhood holds exercise hour from 6 to 7 p.m. daily, when the light is the very most beautiful, and it makes me happy every time I see it. I usually think of Michelle Tea's excellent essay about the admirable scrappiness of pigeons, and the sad hatred people so often direct at them. If we called them rock doves, their real name, would we hate them so much, she wonders. I took a picture of a pigeon chick to send to her, but I haven't sent it yet and that was over a year ago."

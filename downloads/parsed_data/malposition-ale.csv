"event","Man life here is boring!! I'm tired of being alone in this city. So alone that infact my only friends are the people I work with. I wish I could meet some of the people I meet online. Daniel seems like such a good guy. I wish he lived up here instead of in Georgia. Oh well I am lucky o know him this way and I am enjoying reding his journal and looking into his friends whom I hope to meet soon."

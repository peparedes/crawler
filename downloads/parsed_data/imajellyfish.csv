"event","Dang....im on JV. Congrats for kelly haugen...hahaha only freshman! I heard there is movement but i dont think there will be much movement cuz they have like 19 players already.And that's just how much they have after they dropped 5 or 6 players.Now JV has all the players...i dont know..i havent counted.Some players are pretty good. We might do well in the season..who knows! Well this weekend i have a couple tryouts..might jam if i have time. Kelly's changing our music...

"event","Yesterday and today i had soccer try outs......oooooh i'm crossing my fingers..hopefully ill make it. We'll find out tomorrow!
Anywho........rewind to saturday:  BLOOD BROTHERS show..bought a blue shirt that is a youth large cuz they didnt have any adult smalls. And it turned out to be a girl's shirt! dammit..sleeves are closer to my shoulder than halfway down my biceps. Opening bands Mikaela's Fiend was good for the 2nd time i saw them(bought full cd).OhyeaMean Reds kicked ass. The coolest overall dressed band had sweet dancy music(played just as good or better than blood bros). They had the biggest mosh there and i bought their shirt which is in fact a lil ""naughty"" so yea..gotta watch it.BBlayed mostly Crimes w/1 song from Adultery and March...adding Guitarmy, Fuckings Greatest Hits, Cecilia, and Denver Max from Burn. Averaged out to a very good show...ended early at 9:30.
No one liked Chinese Stars..but i thought they were pretty good. Cool singer...using the cowbell and tambourine haha, but it all sounded the same...every song almost the same beat.
""they fed my children to the lions..made me watch it on the television""


Lets party 'till we're purple!


Do you really wanna make me cry??

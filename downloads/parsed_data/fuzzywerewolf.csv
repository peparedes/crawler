"event","I havn't done anything interesting lately. To much homework and studying. I made a buddy profile the other night though. I've been on oekaki alot lately. I had to go to my brothers birthday party yesterday, and I managed to drag Alexandra along with me. I was gonna bring Whitley to but she was grounded for some love letter she wrote to Dale ""from"" Peter wutever his last name is. She wrote it on her Hello Kitty paper. XD Well, for my brothers birthday party we went to the new bowling ally. It was pretty boring and it turns out Alexandra and I are both sucky bowlers. The only reason I had to go was because my mom has the flu or namonia(s/p) and I had to help my dad with the 5 year olds that were there. I swear to god my parents payed those kids to come. XD Alexandra got a slushie and we kept filming it. We also skipped around saying ""We're children we're children we're children"" like those kids in the movie King-Pow. XD We're so retarded.

"event","YEAH! It's a long weekend! That means 1 day less of school and 1 day more of sleeping in untill 10:30! I love to sleep. Anyways, there's nothing really exciting going on in my boring life right now. I just got the new Green Day cd and listened to it over 6 times since I got home at 4:00. I sure do like that cd. I probally like it as much as my afi cd which really hasn't came out of my cd player scince I was at LBI on vacation. I watched The Nightmare Before Christmas today. I love that movie. Jack it awesome. Whitley was saying (at least I think it was her. It was either her or Colleen but w/e) that Teague was the guy with the ax in his head becasue when they bring in the easter bunny instead of Santa he points to it and goes, BUNNY, really stupidly. Just like Teague would do. XD I've also been drawing alot on oekaki lately. I've even had enough time to come up with a fursona which took me probally an hour to think of. And I still have my stupid ear infection. I need a hug. XD"

"event","Yes sadly I am still sick, and at home instead of school. Sarah's brining me home all of my work I'm missing so I won't have to make it all up over the weekend. I have finally begun to make my website! Yes finally! It's not the greatest and it's taking me forever because HTML hurts my head. You can see my website here: www.freewebs.com/lacrossekat . I'm going to make, or attempt to make, the gallery (s/p? XD) today. Oh yes and I've finally made a new fersona! So now I can begin to work on Whitley's which I told her I would do like a month ago. I'm such a loser. XD I actually made Colleen's but I havn't even thought of even starting to make ones for some of my other friends. Man, my head hurts. And I still have to finish current events for social studies which is due tomorrow. And I have to read for language arts. And finish the homework Sarah's gonna give to me. I hate school. Not much else to write about except that I'm listening to Duality by Slipknot. I think this is my new favorite song. Even though I don't know half the words. I had a dream about this music video a couple of weeks ago. It had something to do about a clown with a baseball bat. Wow, I'm weird. XD

"event","I am so sick right now. I'm not at school, which kinda makes me mad becasue I'm gonna hafta make up the soc and science tests we had today. I am freezing even though it's probally really warm out. There is no one online (*mummbles to self*of corse Catilin, they're all at school) and I have nothing to do. I think I might go on the oekaki for a bit, and attempt to draw, even though I can't feel my hands. Maybe I'll even draw something for my D ART account if I'm up to it. I just have no clue what to draw. Maybe I'll draw twinkles or something. I know I should be doing something like reading for Language arts but I really don't feel like it. I am so in love right now it's not even funny. Maybe if he would just talk to me like last year I'd be happy. I have been really depressed lately and I don't know why. I was gonna try and cut myself but then I remembered...I don't like blood...AT ALL. So I decided not to becasue if I did I would have proabally thrown up. It's not even 11:00 and I'm hungry. Maybe I'll make myself a veggie burger or something. I have to check Peta's website to see stuff about KFC and maybe I'll make some letters to help us in our boycott agenst them. I tried talking Kim Raymond into boycotting KFC but apparently she loves KFC. Figures she shure does like to eat (no offence to her and all). Sarah didn't eat the KFC chicken when her and some friends went there. That makes me happy. I think I'm going to go on the oekaki now, I think I'll be able to draw, maybe seeing that that's all I really ever do. Even though I think i suck but alot people don't say I do but wut ever. XD

"event","We had to go to the stupid football game last night for band. It was really borining. There were actually 6 Bass clarinets though, usually there's like...3. We had to sit infront of the Susaphones and they were WICKED funny! They were sining songs like ""when I was 7...i met a guy named keven...and I climed abord a pirate ship and the captian siad to me...we go this way that way  forwad backward over the rolling sea, a bottle of coke to sooth my throt and that's the life for me!"" and stuff like this ""Humpty dumpty sat on a wall, humpty dumty had a great fall all the kings horses and all the kings men and HUH 'ant that funky now? HUMPT DE DUMPT HUMPT HUMPT DE DUMPTY DUMPTY HUMPT DE DUMP HUMPT HUMPT DE DUMPTY DUMPTY..."" and they were doing stuff like that whith all the nersery rymes. At one point we couldn't couldn't htink of any so we sung ""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV and HUH 'ant that funky now?"" It was wicked funny. We also sung banana quack! ""WHEN I SAY BANANA YOU SAY QUACK. BANANA!"" then we'd yell QUACK! lol it was wicked funny. That was really the only good part about it though. We played a bunch of songs I didn't know becasue they were all the high schoolers songs. I play the HEY song though. That one was easy. And for the football part. Well, I don't understand football at all. They drop the ball and they have to start all over again. WTF? Oh, and not to mention any names but there is one person's ass I need to kick actually make that two people because of what they did to me. I won't mention it though because I really don't want anyone to know. Man I really have no life to be writing all of this. In more recent news (meaning this morning) I have to go to karate then I'm going to best buy to get the sims 2 and I think some CDs I want. But what ever like you really care."

"event","Thursday is my birthday.  I'm semi-sick right now.  Alliance to come out anytime soon.  WATCH OUT HERE IT COMES (comes... comes... comes...)!  If you love the big black lens, comment.  Also answer me this question: Fisheye or longlense? Anyone and everyone needs to answer that question.  For those who don't know, longlense is a far away, zoom shot and fisheye is a closeup, wide-angle shot.  (good examples: http://esfootwear.com/team/ladd/media/oxnard_line.mov and http://esfootwear.com/team/ladd/media/sskfbsts_bigspin.mov)  PJ IS THE MAN!  And I secretly filmed him.  If you want to see that footage, stop by my editing shack any day of the week or IM me."

"event","Hmmm... school hasn't been too bad lately.  Went to Somerville High today and got some more footage for GB Hardcore.  It's gonna be a sick video.  I've been editing Rewind this week too.  It's coming out soon, I promise.  Who knows what's gonna happen today.  Brothers' birthday party at Wakefield.  Tomorrow doing something with Sara, but I never know what's I'm going to do one day to the next.  Comment or I get my secret police after you."

"event","Awesome ending to an already okay week.  Went to Allan's, then we decided to go to Boston.  Though I was mortally afraid of going there (because we almost got arrested last time), we went to skate the Aquarium.  Wouldn't you know it, PJ LADD was there!!!  So cool.  I filmed him for the hell of it.  He's so good at skating, it's amazing.  After, I went back to Malden with Allan, and he got a trick at the garage manual pads.  Gotta keep it on the DL for Greenbum Hardcore.  Alliance is almost done.  Tomorrow, I'm probably going to Boston, and then ending the day in Melrose or something like that- we'll see.  Well, I have to go because it's late, and I need to get up early in the morning."

"event","Today, went to Malden Square.  But before I could make it there, I fell pretty hard.  I think i tripped on something and ruined my right arm, but its all good.  Biggie got gap to board in longlense, almost kickflipped big 3, and got a trick at Cheverus.  Yeah so tomorrow I'm filming my video project.  VX2000 wigga.  And its a half day so filming skating as well.  Later, leave comments if you love me."

"event","It rained earlier this week.  I hate rain, but it's okay- it didn't bother me too much.  Filho once again is rad.  Karmen got an LJ!!  Xanga sucks anyways, so I'm glad.  Today we went on a last-minute surprise field trip to the Bayside Expo Center.  Pretty sick, cause they had this awesome college in Savannah, GA.  It's sick because there's a lot of great film studies and digital editing stuff.  Alliance Rewind is coming along, and should be out in a few weeks.  After that, I can finally take a break and get ready for Putz and the VX-1000.  Well, that's all for now.  Updates later in the week when good stuff happens."

"event","A good end to an okay vacation.  Skated with Allan, Louie, Biggie, and Good Skate in Malden Square.  This vacation wasn't as good as the Christmas one, but it was alright.  Mostly skated with Allan and Mike, but I did see The Girl Next Door.  It's a really good movie and is manditory that everyone who reads this now goes and sees it.  Friday, I went to the mall with Karmen and then met up with Allan after he came back from Mississippi.  Yeah, so this week was okay.  It was fast though, and I didn't get everything done that I wanted to or see everyone that I wanted to.  Later."

"event","I decided to make a LJ because all of the other ones aren't cool and everyone seems to have one anyways.  Well, I just have to make sure to update more.  Which is what I'll do when I get back from this exciting last day of vacation."

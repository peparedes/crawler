You're shy<br>at times but friendly, and you are never weak<br>and always independent. You are incredibly<br>intelligent (wise beyond your years) and have a<br>talent for many things (sports, music, art).<br>You have a kind and warm personality and enjoy<br>the simple things. Like hanging out with<br>friends and watching movies at home. But you're<br>sometimes quiet nature makes you a bit of an<br>outcast and a mystery to people. No matter how<br>pretty you are or smart or athletic, you just<br>can't seem to break into the crowd and be<br>noticed. Don't worry, try to be more outgoing<br>and speak out when you have more to say. Don't<br>hide behind your books and sports and computer,<br>get out there and get noticed. You also have<br>deep desires in life and feel vunerable and<br>alone at times. Don't feel sad either, What<br>helps me to express feelings and dreams that I<br>can't say to people, is through my writting.<br>Maybe you should try.

"event","<p><strong>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.......So what else is new. Today has been a great week so far. I won 150$ in the football pool Im in..I'm also in second place for the 500$ prize..SWEET!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't have to pay off my T.V. anymore since&nbsp; help the guy so much he told me not to worry about it. Then I plug the cable in at my house and find out that it works!!!!! SWEETNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong>&nbsp;<br /><font color=""#0000ff""><strong>So other than that I have discovered that I am right as always. It's funny how I set people up to make themselves look so stupid. Then I feel so much better and reinforce that my feelings from the beggining that were right. Usuually, I just get persuaded that I am wrong, people can't take my emotions. I am honest and strightforward with them when I need to be, and it's funny because most people act like they have no emotions and I think I throw them totally off by just being honest when they ask for the truth. The sad part is I find myself being too nice too people and they can't bring thmselves to tell me the truth, hahaha that is the best part of all. I guess people can't be strong enough. HAHAHA People find my kindness weak, and yes they do take advantage of it.&nbsp;I have a new feeling about kindness though, it is my strength. It is the one thing I can be all the time and i can't be wrong for doing it. Then when people do fucked up things to me I don't feel like it was anything I did at all. Therefore it makes it their problem and not my own. Even after shit goes down people can't be honest...again not strong enough. People are good at telling others what they want them to hear and think, yet I see through it all and people can't begin to fathom how I know things before they tell me and what not...HAHAHAHA. I may still act like I don't know what's going on, just to get extra information out of it.........I think about 10 steps ahead of everyone else. It's not hard and because people are so predictable it has become sort of a hobby.......HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA It's actually quite sick that I can do this, but I've had a few good teachers. Most people who think they have balls do, until they meet me. Then I get the best of them, KILL PEOPLE WITH KINDNESS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a good saying and it is not a weakness but one of the ultimate strengths....<br /></strong></font><br />Yet I know that sometimes I can be the biggest asshole. Some people think that I am the biggest asshole to walk this earth. HAHA which can be true but don't give me a reason. Sometimes it is not really provoked, and it's because I'm angry, upset, in a bad mood yatta yatta yatta. Everyone has times they go through like this. I think I could be so much worse though. Sometimes I think that I should be. I hate hurting people though. It makes me feel badly afterwards, and hurting people is not something I find enjoyable anyway. Yet, sometimes people just like to hurt others. Then there are times that people act selfish and do not take into account that they could be hurting someone else. It doesn't mean they are trying to do this on purpose, but by their actions and what not it would seem that way. For people to be that selfish makes me sick, I mean I do it too I'm not perfect. Yet, there are people out there who just think about&nbsp;what they want and do not take other peoples feeling into consideration. I do not understand it because I am constantly thinking about others, not myself, others. is that what makes me so nice? Is that why I have to learn not to care?, because I can't please everyone. Either way, people go through what they have to go through in life to get to where they are suppose to be. Maybe I have these experiences to strengthen myself, and make myself more of an understanding and self-less person. I do not know&nbsp;in what direction I am headed or what the future holds. I do know that I am heading in the direction that&nbsp;I want to be. Still it is hard because there are many bumps along the way and your not always prepared for them. Sometimes&nbsp;the bumps throw you into a spiral spinning effect that can bring you down and make you feel weird and not yourself for days. I think the key though is to remeber that it does&nbsp;not matter because in the end everthing will work itself out how it was meant&nbsp;to be. But WTF do I know.....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p><strong>Yea so I feel good. Not really any idea why but I do. Bored at work, as usual. I think I feel like I'm back in control I guess. When your emotions sometimes get the best of you it feels as if you have no way to control how you feel even if you want to.&nbsp; Human nature, and not all of us live the same way. So many people try to tell others what works for them, they say this is what you have to do...for instance parents, teachers, friends, they all try to tell us what would be best to do/feel/say/act and what not. Well what works for some people does not work for everyone. As I say all the tim everyone is so different depending on experiences, upbringing, culture, yatta yatta....and why is it that so many peopel are so good at giving advice but so bad at taking their own advice? They know it too, and it's funny because they will say I can figure out everyone's life out but my own...haha which I guess in some sense is true..well all could be good at that. It is so easy looking at someon's life and tell them what and how to do things, maybe because we look at their life with no repracussions from bad experiences, kind of looking at something for the first time, unless we hav reason to fear it why should&nbsp;we? What is fear anyway? I think it is a term to genrally used to define self-doubt or strength....and why would one doubt themselves...? Because of past experiences? Well that would normally work but since everyone is different than should every person be a new and different experience than the last....People have fear because they are not strong&nbsp;enough to face what they fear.....I don't in any way think that everyone os out to get everyone, there are many good good people on this earth.....I have met many of them, and&nbsp;I hear all the time that&nbsp;there is not many good people. I think good people are passed by because&nbsp;of their demeanor, there are many people that should not be trusted and for this reason we try to protect ourselves. Although when you protect yourself too much yuo can miss out on some pretty awesome experiences. Not caring about something that is the easy way out, it is a way not to work out problems, to get rid of somthing without feeling regret or remorse. It is something I find myself unfortunatley becoming better and better at......it is easy to walk&nbsp;out on people and to not&nbsp;remember......bit is it worth it&nbsp;in the long run? We give what we get correct? Well that sure as hell ain't true.......At least I don't know it to be true...i put in too much and get out so little......should i try putting in little ? no that would b usatisfactory to my own standards of&nbsp;the type of person I should be. I don't think that anyone could ever be me, I don't thin anyone could walk in these shoes..As bad as some people have it....I know that I am strong, even if I do&nbsp;stumble on the path, I always get right back up. Some people never get up, some people never are the same, and if your me you didn't know the difference......&nbsp;</strong></p>"

"event","<p><strong>The best I have felt in a little while anyway. Well stress and thinking about shit wise...I never knew being <font color=""#ff0000"">COMPLETLY</font> honest was so hard. But it is, but it feels much better....I got so many things off my chest that I need to tell somone anyone, and it felt great to have a friend that truly seems genuine for once, still&nbsp;if I've learned anything it's that only time will tell.&nbsp;I made some mistakes that could have been completly blown up in my face. Luckily, someone finally understood and had some compassion for what I was feeling and going through. Although I was not yelled at I probably deserved it. It ended up being a step in the right direction, a new way of thinking and going about things. As for everything else....I'm not sure that I can always be completly&nbsp;honest because i am afraid that people really don't want to hear my honest feelings. I have always been told since I was a kid that my feelings were wrong or that they did not matter, but I know they do...hahah well maybe I am kidding myself....they are important to me.&nbsp;I guess you can't always like the answers you hear, but at least then you know the truth, so you can either get hurt and&nbsp;get it out of the way,&nbsp;or get out of being in the situatio at least&nbsp;then you know the truth right? Still, something about being honest is weird, do you only be honest when asked&nbsp;a question? Or should you be honest all the time rifling off the top of your head with how you truly feel? I would think that either would be the wrong way......I think that you have to make these descisions from the heart and really decide what is worthy and unworthy of being totally openly honest about. While protecting yourself from those people that we won't mention at this time....yet if you speak from the heart and how you truly feel than you can't short change yourself.&nbsp; Then you know where you stand and you let others know where they stand......I learned a few things tonight, but the most important is that there are some things I have to get over.....I think that I may still think like a kid sometimes, being niave to the coldness, cruelness, and dishonesty in the world.......but i just need to get over it and make myself a <font color=""#0000ff"">STRONGER</font> person.....because sometimes&nbsp;I may not get a second chance.....haha&nbsp;and there is never a third chance.....&nbsp;</strong></p>"

"event","So...umm yea stuck at work bored as hell. Working nights blows. Hardly anyone awake and nothing&nbsp;going on.....I wish someone would try and break into a car so I could beat their ass. So I realized part of my problem, which I think may be a HUGE part. I'm lonley, HAHAHA and I already know how that sounds....aww poor me. Nah. Well yea but..haha not the point.&nbsp;I haven't spoken to my mother in over a year. The last time&nbsp;we really spoke was after the house burnt down. She left me all on my own,&nbsp;then eventually she forgot about that...I think. If she did her b/f certainly didn't. So then again once more she moves gives me a day notice and says well good luck..HAHAHA. GOOD LUCK?! With what you dumb bitch, and I loved how she left all my wet clothes and w/e else on the porch in the middle of Brockton....HAHAHA oooo Brother. So needless to say we haven't spoken since. I'm sick of her picking her men over me, the funny part about that is if it wasn't for me she wouldn't have met two of them haha. So in turn I am thinkiing that it is affecting me subconsiously and making me feel somewhat alone. I miss my brothers and sisters. I have not seen them in a LONG time...at least 8 months now.....gggrrr I missed my little sister's birthdays. I want to go see them but&nbsp; don't want to see my mother. At least not alone. It's not that I am not strong enough or anything, but I feel sick&nbsp;to my stomach everytime I think about going to&nbsp;see her, and personally it disturbs me to think that my OWN mother would have done sch horrible things to me to make me feel that way. I just moved out to Boston, and just being up here in itself is lonley. yes there are some friends ou this way, but not many. My family is at least a 40 min drive away which isn't far but they live with my mom hahaha. I guess I am being immatrue when it comes to this, but I&nbsp;always have been a little immature, and insecure when it comes to any relationship. I miss my other sister as well. She had a kid which makes me an uncle, I'm pretty sure he is about 8 months and I haven't seen him yet,...which makes me very sad, plus ever since we were younger my sister always ratted on me so we don't have the best relationship yet. EVERY SINGLE PERSON who I have EVER been close to stabs me in the back. It has not yet to fail. I don't even get to see my Godson who I LOVED SOOO much, Zachary Ethan Bosworth. HAHA I have his name tattoed on me, ans wut;s funny is I suggested a name for his little brother and he ended up liking it so much that he wouldn't let his parents call the baby anything but, hahah he was my little guy and it's been so long since I've seen him last, I bet he's not so little anymore...he was so awesome the funniest and sweetest kid ever, and not to forget smart...Holy Crap never seen&nbsp; a little kid so smart. on the comp and using it by himself at 2!!!!!!!&nbsp;That is the reason why, and I choose not to get close to people as much, I like to keep my distance for a while. I&nbsp;like good people though and enjoy being in their company. It's always nice to know&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;if you ever need anything that they will be there, and moreover it's nice to know that there are just good people still ou there. So yes Iwould like to go see her but I know she'l guilt trip me a bit and we'll end up arguing like EVERY time we talk. I'm not just ready for the stress that I have to endure with that event. I understand that I only have one mother, but she sure as hell doesn't act like a good on anyway....I mean it's not like she's ecven tried to call me these past months. I would think that for somone who used to stand up fpr her when she was wrong, and somone&nbsp; who wouldn't tolerate any man treating her like crap when she wasn't strong enough to stand up fo herself. For somone who has always been there and never left her side she was pretty quick to abandon me on more than one occasion, for her men. HaShe wonders why she doesn't talk to her parents. For somone who didn't want to be treated like that when she was a kid she's doing a pretty good job at making sure that the Apple doens't Fall very Far From the Tree........Well that felt good, i know this is an issue that I am having problems with...even relaizing it was REALLY bothereing to me because it has taken me a logn time to figure it out......I still have alot of figuring out to do......At least this is a start...I am happy that I was able to recongnize this"

I learned to day that there are people out there who fee like I do. Ecven though I may have gone through these things earlier than the poeple I am reffering too, It is nice to be able to understand that somone else has had these feeling at one&nbsp;point or another.

Although it would be nice to have a few more friends who are like myself, only time can tell I guess. I'm just glad I don't feel like I did the past few days...not saying I am cured but I will say that I have made a step in the right direction, and if i could just keep making those steps it would be great. In the meanwhile I think I will do what I can for others who DESERVE IT. I'm so done with putting effort into people who never give anything in return.....Tonight was a good night with hopefully many more to follow...even though i am at work......</strong>"

"event","<p><strong><font size=""1"">All I ate was a bag of cheez-its all day and i realized that I was hungry. Since learning I was hungry I thought hey...things aren't so bad....I then thought that these years that I am living right now are the best years of my life. Why should I ever feel the way I have the past few days. Granted it's just a right now type thing haha but I'd have to go with I'm young and need to keep that in mind. I think it may be human tendancy to want everything all at one time. Being patient is so hard, and many of our wants are not fulfilled as quickly as we would like them to be. Although, I find that many of our needs are satisfied.....people just tend to be unhappy with what they ?posess?. Maybe it is my experience because of losing EVERYTHING in my life all together at once I was very humbled and am happy now with just the few people I keep close,&nbsp;small acheivements, and possesioins that I own. Haha what's good about having alot of money when the chance is that the more you have the more you&nbsp;can&nbsp;lose, and it's pretty easy to lose things. I thought I didn't care about alot of things, that I let&nbsp;go and I did. Maybe I have to let more things go and just keep more things in prespective. I do have to be patient more though&nbsp;think, you never know where anyone, or anything is going to come, Usually when you least expect them. I just had a random thought that I often here about myself, People often tell me I am very deep. Haha and for the most part I tell them yes your right. Yet I don't understand why more people aren't and why they would think that I am not. I have had people tell me I need to find myself (wtf does that mean).....does that mean that I live through other peoples identity if i have to find my own? HAha well what do you expect me to think? Unfortunatley I know what's in store for the near future...the changes that will be made or forced upon me. It's nice to know helps me get over feeling that I have for the present, but still, it doesn't feel good to always know. And this was random and all because I was thinking about stuff too much again. but writing feels so good....</font></strong></p>"

Everyday is a challege in one which to I arise.&nbsp; Never again to be held by the chains of authority,religion,deprssion,boredem,women,society. I enjoy life and no matter what anyone does to me I can either choose to let it bother me/affect my life or not. Life is a roller coaster journey with many experiences and each experience is good/bad determined by the attitude of the person. Some people know how to be good people, most do not. The world is a scarry place in where I must raise my kidz someday? HAHA I don't think so. It is quite creul to bring a child into this world. Death and destruction increase every year within. Over inflation, immigration, over population,social diversity, politics,religion,society, all a power struggle within themselves. Each looking to prevail, well I know that every top power in the world that has ever been eventually becomes a third world country like Mexico. HAHAHA Imagine trying to bring a child up in Mexico, wow no thanks.&nbsp;<br /><br /></font></strong>I<strong><font color=""#0000ff""> beleive that the solution is this.......<br />People need to learn to think and love from the heart. People just need to have a genuine caring for each other. Just a little more courtesy and respect. Everyone on earth is the same it is society that gives other people the power. Society determines what each important aspect of your life is. For example, The Church used to be a major power until people (society) stopped believing in them. Or, that to be with the in style or cool you have to have this, drive this, wear this, smoke this, drink this, listen to this, hahahaha People need to stop judging each other and connect on a deeper level that has nothig to do with drugs,alcohol,sex. People need to learn how to have an underastanding for one another. Understand that no on of us is similiar to the other. Which means for example that the concept of God lies different in every single persons mind and therefore creating an image of God that is different in everyone. Which means no one on earth can have the same God. HAHAHA Yet people argue and kill each other over something like this. Lol it's actually quite funny how guliblie the human race is acting upon impulse and feelings, rather than rasional logic, listening to the heart, and careful thought. Impules are a good human instict but not always true and can lead to misunderstandings and judging thoughts. The Hearts where it's at.<br /></font></strong><br />Ehh I just wanted to write about something. Just want to be able to look back at my thoughts from years past to see how much i have changed and bettered myself.<br /><br />If you read this....HAHA You must really care what I think and know that these are my most personal thoughts and you must really know me."

Like real hard in the ass. Them make up some really shitty excuse saying its not you.Ha they just can't admit that they are pissed at you for sometihng and they won't say what? Becuase you haven't done anuting latley for them they forget everyhting that you have done and everything you know. Somw people are very manipulative. Manipulative peple are very good at what they do. But when someone else realizes it they play the victim. 

I hate your bullshit because you don't get your way. You choose that path not I. I can't wait to leave. Because now you have what you want but is it what you really want? is it what you need. face it your pathetic and you need to look at your life and think. I'm not there anymore. You find your way, to get what you think you need. You have what you htink is good for you., People know your scam its only a matter of time before your figured out. Until then live your fairy tale. I'll be the one happy in the end and you'll be figured out. Keep using people against each other and you'll be figured out. You take my happiness and my worries and keep them.

"event","Wow... So much time has passed since. Yet, today thinking and talking about it brought back a lot of painful memories. I can't believe that I felt the way i did today. I can't believe that after this time I still think about it and I still hurt by the actions that were brought upon myself. It was or a reason though, that what happened happened, and what is done is done. But I don't think I'll ever be able to forget. Consequently the painful memories will burn in my heart forever. Along with the love and feelings that I had endured. I don't know if anuthing will ever change nor do I regret what has happened. I thank the Lord for granting me the courage and strenth to work through this. It may be a long time before anything changes or I feel any differently, or even if forget things that have affected me. Yet, the feelings and the memories I can't believe are still this painful and that they still bother me. It only makes me stronger though, and builds character. Like Dave S. told me.... 

""Even after everything is said and done. Keep telling yourself that you are a good person, because you are and they can't change that. If this door closes another will open. You just have to be patient because everything happens for a reason.""

Thank You Dave. Not that you'll ever read this but thank you and for all you have done."

"event","Wow i haven't posted in this thing forever.... Well I've been working aot and def. enjoying my summer. Trying to have as much fun as i can before everyone goes away. I miss talking to people..I haven't talked to so many people in so long.   
    
 
 But there is one issue i have to adress... I think that many people are confused about things that they think they kno a lot about.... Such as abortion...

First off i do realize that abortion may be morally wrong and cruel..Still it does have a positive side to it.
 
 For example In brockton alone..ow many mother's do you see that the kids are fatherless? They go on welfare and the stae ends up taking care of their baby.


this is what i do not appreciate...
TheWonderfulWop: Frankly, I don't think you can call your self a catholic and be prochoice. do you know what a partial birth abortion involves? It's when the doctor forces the birth during the third trimester when the baby is almost fully developed and then doctor puts a drill and the baby's skull while it is still semi conscious and sucks it's brains out. If you'r for that kind of treatment then I guess thats your opinion. 


How can anyone say that i could not be catholic..i mean it is as if this kid were actually listening to the catholic church. I mean really think about it if he should preach to me aboput something like that then lets start listening to everything the church says.... Give 10% of our income to them...go to church EVRY sunday..shit like that I mean wtf...

 These people who are against thrid trimester abortion want their cake and they want to eat it to. They believe in some kind of abortion but not in other's? No that's not how it goes it's either nothing or everyting. 

Just like no smoking in public places you can't have some smoking and some not it's just not constitutional. As fdor smpoking in public places that's debatable. But as for a women's right to choose that is hers and hers alone so the government should stay out of american's bedrooms and stop legislating when people choose to do their will."

    What is meaning. Is there really a God? I mean if you think about it for years people have come up with there own fantasies about how we got here and what will come. Is it all true or is any of it true. Do we have a religion because that's how we were raised. Or because we may like the ideas of one philosiphy. I don't understand it. It is way to complex. Can animals believe in certain things that aren't instictual? Or is that what separates us from the animal world.
         It would seem to me that God and all the ideas are just comforting so that humans don't have to deal with the fear and anxiety of death and what it brings about. I think that many people are afraid of death and need someting to help them through it.   
                        Myself i believe that maybe there is something out there but i'm not sure at all. I find death to be the ultimate adventure. I would say that i can't wait until i die and i welcome the experience freely. When i die the questoin of all questions will be answered. I am a very curious pperson and actually can't wait to find out what happens. Not to say that i don't want to live but i am just very curious. I feel badly about questioning my faith. But is there really an answer that expalins our exsistance besides evolution. It really is quite puzzling to the mind. It's kind of fustarting to beieve just the word of humans sometimes because as we all know humans can be liyng and decitful. What do you think....."

Who will be there for you,
Never say goodye to me,
And i won't do the same to you,

I don't want it to end,
It never has,
But nothing goes on foerever,
It will one day, you'll be gone,
You without me me without you, we'll never be together.

So be like everyone else if you don't wann hurt,
It's the only way,
Don't take chances, risks, or even try to feel,
Then you won't have to face your fears you can't be hurt.

So keep to yourself leave me alone and everything will be ok,
Cuz you won't have to feel like this or even remeber.

It's great at first but then it crumbles,
Down and down you fall,
Until it comes again you fall and just hope,
But where did hope just us all,
Farther and farther into darkness.

Then you realize that your hope is all you have,
No else really cares and its were you find your strenth,
You realize only you can help you,
You find that human nature sucks,
Only you can help you no one else,
That's when you become pissed off and act like you don't give a fuck.

Then the cycle repeats itself,
Never satisfying your needs,
Until oyu realize it's happeneing again,
Then you try to protect your pride.

It will never end, it goes on forever,
So you try to cope, try to live,
But you never do get better.

One day you will be thinking,
It will hit you inadvertently,
Then you'll think why was I acting stupidly.

You'll learn not care,
Not to try,
Not to wonder,
Everything will be ok,
Until that day which will probally never be,
Just learn how to cry....

Don't try to be the tough one,
It's not worth it,
All it is is repression,
It's ok, I'll be there for you,
Likei always have.

You'll finally realize it and think and think and think,
Then it'll be ok again,
Cuz I'm the one you think.

To you it will be better,
To me it'll be the same,
I'm gonna be by myself,
So I have no one to blame..."

 This will be very crucial and vital to the survival of all your party situations...so listen up.....I will be putting together my list later on in the week....
 
 
 
 
    Party Tip #1!

When going to a party where you know for a fact that there will be boos and drugs and/or anything that may alter your state of mind and judgement, let this be a word of helpful advice.....

        When attending one of these make sure that when you first walk in you pick out the ugliest fatest girl at the party. (Or guy) After you start to drink and are feelings a bit tipsy keep an eye on this girl... When you start to notice that this girl has sudenlly become quite attractive DO NOI I repeat DO NOT go anywhere near her! Swallow your pride and you should very quicklt decide to get the hell ot of that party as fast as you possibly can..I would feel bad if any of my friends might hook-up or become pregant by one of these girls. (Or guys) It will ruin your life and you will forever feel distugting and insulted. And you will give that fat girl so much confidence. It's the type of confidence that us ""fortunate"" people hate to see because they take all of our fun.....


  I only know from experience...Learn from my mistake and i will feel so much better."

Although it would seem kind of childish. Still, I like the idea opf being able to express my thoughts ideas and days with othes and reading the comments.

She thought he was her toy,
Round and round her finger he spun,
Until she had used him then she told him she's done.
She was sick of the mess that only time had brought,
It was time that had caused their relationship to rot.
The boy was left cold and broken,
What about all the nice words he had spoken?
He took all the blame was it something he did?
Niave little boy, ha he was only a kid,
Being the way he is now did him no good,
He lives in the past in what have could.
Her life is no fairy tale either,
She lives with her boyfriend, the boy that beats her,
She accepts it and lives in fear and longing,
For that one boy who made her feel so belonging.
They now are both alone and live in solitude,
Do get back what they had what would you do?"

He's done everything in his power but that still isn't enough. Is that what keeps him dragging and hoping? The GAME. Is that what everything is about? Is it all a game? Well time for them to stop.

The emotion that had burned him not once, twice, or thrice....It was the emotion that burned him everyday, every waking moment, it ate a whole through his heart. A hole that was never sown shut. He thought many days of finding his ""reason"" for showing that emotional which he was very well aware of not having. He had just been able to cope all these years that the mask which eh hid behind became permanent. There was nothing he could do but hope and go on just apologizing for what he had maybe taken for granted.&nbsp; He often sat lonley, hoping that someone would notice him calling out for help in the bottomlees pit that he had found his way into. He had always wantwed to get out, to be free of the pain and evil that had plauged him. The many years of his life wasted away to the pain and guilt of others. He was an underachiever.... never wanted much out of life except to be accepted, loved, normal. and happiness. He had grown up long before his time was due. He needed to be det free. He changed from experience to experience but always wondered if he kept changing would anyone love him for him? Would or should he need a reason to change? Would he wait for what might never find him? He always had wanted to be himself but the societal brackets he was forced to live between made him into the role-model type of kid that could do&nbsp;no wrong and had everything together and going for him. He just smiled everyday of his life and hoped noone would notice anything was&nbsp;wrong. Then it went wrong. He was, or so he thought hit the rock bottom and never to&nbsp;reach and find his salvation. Slowly but surley he came to find himself. With only his inner strenth this time. Not the strenth of others. He realied he had achieved what he had always wanted to. Independance! In that hard time of desparity all he had was himself. He would never again be at the mercy of his feelings. That is until he met her.. until she ripped his heart out and put it back when the convienency was there. Only when her TEARS had to be caught. What about his tears? Was he so undeserving or was he just not good enough? </FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Who are you too judge?&nbsp;</FONT></STRONG></P>

I was driving fomr my first job to my second job and I felt really weird for no reason at all so w/e. i was like oh no here it comes again. Then I went to work and then got out. Then I had to go to church to read (always a blast) cough cough! Then the fun started. supposedly I started to harass my Stepfather. He said i pulled up in North junior High and sarted harrasing him. Ha what a bitch! So then I had to go to the police station. When i got there he was there and started running his mouth to me and the cop just let it happen. So my first reaction was like WTF! I couldn't understand y he just let that happen. So then I had to use my phone so I told Amanda to wait in there and tell me if they said anything while I was gone. Then Amanda came running out saying that they were gonna get me outta there and it was going to be taken care of. So i got really really scared and I thought i was going to be arrested. Then, the cop took me outside and basically told me to try to stay away from Todd because he's a nut. I've put up with so much shit from him before that i won't allow myself to be treated like that again. (No one knows that story). Then all my fun started...I was just in the best mood after that...i just hadn't felt that way in the longest time ever. I was my old self again. Like me me and it felt so good and i haven't felt bad since. Like all of a sudden things snapped back inot place and it was gone. So today is a good day too..i still feel good.

<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know what i hate the most....? I s when people use words to describe others in no way that is fititng at all. I was reading the herald at work and it mentioned something about the football ""hero"" that left his career to go and fight in Iraq. it so pisses me off that they use the word ""hero"". Why is he a ""hero"" becaus ehe left the multi-million dollar making sport that he loved to play to go and fight. There are plenty of people who leave their whole families, wives,&nbsp;children, and belongings to go over to Irag and fight. People, men and women&nbsp;who might have just had kids or people who have already lost family menebers in Irag to go and fight for our freedom. Why is this football player a ""hero""? it makes me so angry when their are plenty of wives, husbands, and even young kids who leave everyting they know to save this country while the government only gives them a pat on the back to say congrats. What do they say to those people of fallen family members....""We're sorry for your loss?"" That is such crap! What do they say to the kids of two year old swho have lost their dads or moms. Or what about the kids who gorw up with out parents because of thier loss. the government is total shit and their all a bunch of low-life sissies who sit in their nicley protected offices all day while our own flesh and blood go out to fight their war. Fuck them they know nothing of what it is like. They are all low-life, inconsiderate, selfish basterds who want nothing more than to take credit for the good doings of other human beings....&nbsp; PLEASE COMMENT!</STRONG></P>"

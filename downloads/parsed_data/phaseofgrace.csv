Jimmy McCarron is intimately acquainted with fear. Not that he feels it, but he spends most of his life causing it. He knows that he's the kind of man that people are afraid of. Or if they're not, and they give him a reason -- which admittedly, he doesn't need much -- they learn to be afraid of him.

It's in the way he carries himself, the innate self-confidence that says he knows exactly what he's capable of and trusts himself in such a way that nothing will rattle his iron nerves. In his eyes, their intense blue, that always say there's more ticking in his head than what he shows. Man or monster, nobody knows, but there's always a higher level in his thoughts. Not that he's not also, at five foot ten with his precise manner of speech and his no-bullshit attitude, capable of roughing somebody up or forcing the point. Everything about Jimmy McCarron screams that he was built to be a war machine and he knows what he is.

He embraces the antagonism. He takes no egotistical pleasure in making people afraid of him, but to him, it's no matter. It's just part of what he does. What he does, after all, is all that he is. One day with people afraid of what he's capable of...is just another ordinary day.

"event","<B>What would you do for the love of your life? What wouldn't you do?</B>

That's a very funny question, wiseass. Don't think for a second I don't know what you're intimating.

I <I>loved</I> her. Past tense. And it was never some big fucking violin-inspiring feeling, either. She was always with somebody else, first Frank ""Golden Retriever Boy"" Smith and later she got back with Michael. I never had any claim on her, and I never wanted one. You can care for somebody without wanting to possess them. We knew exactly where we stood with one another. I let her in, she let me in, we made the deal to stick by each other. 

And she understood the work always comes first. There was never even a chance of it being any different. She wants a normal life. I don't.

I've killed for her, I've saved her life, I've been willing to die for her, I've laid my career on the line for her. She would do the same for me, and she probably has, I just can't be bothered to damn well remember every instance. It's no big deal. Sometimes people are just like that. But she knows that anytime someone's giving her shit, if she needs it dealt with, I will be there again.

I'll always be willing to eliminate the problem.

"event","<B>South.</B>

Some people say I'm from the South. But it's a stretch. I was born in Savannah, Georgia. But I was raised in the Bronx, and I live in Los Angeles, so it's not like I have any particular Southern heritage. I don't even have an accent. My partner says I have a faint New York accent, but half of what he says is bullshit.

I work in Southern California. LAPD Robbery Homicide Division day shift. The supervisor is Captain Ruth Hagermann. My partner is Ryan Sheridan, one of the two supervising sergeants, and he's a stand-up guy, even if he hasn't gotten over the shock of having stripes on his dress uniform yet. I just wish he would shut up about his wife and his desire for kids. Some of us don't live in a domestic fantasy. But that's Los Angeles. Nobody is happy with what they have. Everybody wants to be someone else.

It's all about who has it and who wants it, and what they're willing to do to get it. And if that involves committing a crime, then I have full license to show up at your door and kick your ass for it.

...

This was a complete waste of my time.

"event","<B>What is something that has happened to you that has helped shape the person you are today?</B>

Frank Smith got a girlfriend.

I'm sure he's had one before; it's not as if I keep track of his social life. He's not a homicidal maniac, and he's got that annoying retriever look on his face, I'm sure someone found him attractive at some point. But four years ago there was a federal agent who got involved in one of our cases and he was smitten. He volunteered to do her protective detail when somebody tried to kill her, and mooned after her the whole time after until she finally agreed to go on a date with him. 

None of this had shit to do with me. But this girl kept showing up, from that first case to the SWAT standoff that came after. She was in my space and as a result, in my life. He was falling all over her, and she wasn't noticing. And I didn't notice her until we ran into each other in the parking lot. We started talking. Frank flipped, of course, telling her I wasn't worth her time. She didn't listen to him. I liked that about her. Besides, what did it matter, he got the girl anyway. He was happy.

She needed some help, from somebody who wouldn't be afraid of unpredictable situations. After I'd saved her in that SWAT standoff, she thought I had what it took to do the job. I liked the challenge. She handed me the case, and that was how I got involved with CTU.

Frank Smith got a girlfriend.

By the time that she finally agreed to go out with him, I'd already helped her save the city of Los Angeles, and I'd saved her life. And I'd changed mine for good. Because she broke up with him two years later, and I've still got her back.

"event","<B>Write a ficlet on the word ""trust.""</B>

Jimmy McCarron trusts her enough to not grab her by the wrist and tell her she's being stupid, or to throw her boyfriend up against a wall and commit a dissection of his soul.

Because really, every time he looks at Brittany since they got off that Concorde at LAX, the prevailing thought in his head has been <I>What the fuck is going on with you?</I>

He's never been judgmental or protective of his close friend, and he's not like all the other guys when it comes to her actions. His philosophy is that it's her life, and he will not stop her from doing whatever she wants to do. However, that philosophy never implied or required <I>understanding</I> whatever it is she wants to do. Usually he's good at following her logic; they're both smart people with solid common sense. This time, however, he has no fucking clue what happened and he was <I>there</I> for most of it, which only makes his annoyance-slash-confusion worse. Annoyance at himself for not getting it; confusion because this is so far out of line for her he can't even see where she's standing anymore.

<I>Yesterday you were my best friend
But tomorrow took you away
There's not much for me to say now
Just goodbye, farewell
And all of it's crashing
Like a tidal wave coming over me</I>

She's protective of the people she loves, has worked for years to build a perfect world, understands the commitment she has to said world, and loves her husband enough to forgive his multitude of sins. So <I>of course</I> she'd leave everyone she loves behind, move all the way across the country to start over, abandon the spaces between she's come to fill, divorce her husband, and do it all for someone completely new who as far as McCarron can tell, she'd met only weeks earlier.

Together with Faith and T.J. he's been seeing what he can find out about the guy. He knows what happened out there: Brittany's best friend Brian called in House as medical backup. He assisted in Brittany's recovery, and they spent a significant amount of time alone together in the back of the Concorde. Next thing McCarron knows, Frank is telling him she's brought the guy to work. After that, she's leaving and he's sizing the guy up from across the ballroom at the Palms. Now she's gone, leaving him with the ghost of an embrace and the memory of whispered promises. It screams that it's wrong, but he keeps his mouth shut and goes back to work. Work that now seems mundane when compared to what she led him through, what she trusted him to do.

<I>And every time I close my eyes
My heart is bleeding deep inside
But now my eyes are open
And I'm never gonna be the one for you</I>

He does his job, the same way he did before she came into his life. It's still enough to push him but not far enough, not anymore. And when it's over is the worst of it. The void of her is worse than the void of the world she gave him, though he misses the challenge more than he misses her, because the fight is what he lives for. He never lived for her, but he thinks that he could have. She taught him that. That loving her wasn't weak, wasn't wrong. When they were together, when it was them and Michael, even - he had felt like that could carry on to forever. Then she let it all go - for a guy old enough to be her father that none of them even know.

Part of his brain screams it's jealousy but he knows it's not. She would never be his. If it hadn't been this guy, she would've stayed with Michael. And true, Michael turned a blind eye to the times he held her hand, or kissed her before the fall, but that's not the same thing. He said he loved her. She said she loved him. Yet he'll always be a fighter before a lover. She's gone, so he goes back to the fight. That's what he has. He was never waiting on her to come and make it all okay. 

Still, she left her imprint on his soul. Opened a small part of it that was hers and hers alone, and will always call to her. He thinks of her often as he does her work, alongside Mark Holden keeping the city in one piece. It helps him understand her better now that he has succeeded her. He misses her. He can admit that. Misses her blind faith, her passion, her power. He will always be standing in the shadows right behind her, waiting for her call. There's just more darkness between them now than there used to be. There's a space between them. It was never supposed to be that way. She made the choice to put distance between them, ironic after the years she spent trying to get close to him.

But, he ruminates as he wonders if she's still wearing his medallion around her neck like she had every day since he gave it to her, he trusts her enough to put her life back in her own hands and let her carry on. He's turned the page and left behind the love they had; he buried it on that airplane. She obviously has gone on. They'll stand together alone. He trusts her enough to stand with her when he's not there, when she's a million miles from home.

<I>So I wanted you to know
That I finally let you go
After all I've held on to 
This is my goodbye to you</I>"

He doesn't even have it anymore, and it didn't mean a thing to him, really, until he let it go. That stupid platitude about not knowing what you've got until it's gone comes into his mind, but that's not it at all.

The Saint Christopher medallion was sitting in a drawer somewhere, probably had been there for a while, since whenever he had lost his faith, if he'd ever really <I>had</I> any faith. He had come across it and sat there looking at it, and somehow he knew she would get good use out of it. Not that she was religious, either, but for other reasons. Christopher was the patron saint of holy death, for one, and she was convinced she was on her way to a noble demise. He was also no longer a saint, just human, and she was the best example of what humanity could be and how it could be constructive without being naive or otherwise falsified. That, and as long as she had it, part of him was with her and vice versa, in some weird way. He wasn't normally one for stupid emotional gestures like that, but with her he wanted her to know he would always be standing in the shadows waiting for her to find him a next challenge, next crucible. He loved those battles, and she provided them. She kept him alive. Life turned to love, but love had been buried now, turned to an alliance that was unlike any other.

She's gone now, having left to be with somebody he doesn't really know, leaving him and her now ex-husband to fight on without her. It bothers him for the unknown. He's gone back to his normalcy as a homicide detective and nothing more, but he knows you don't ever go back after being the shadow to a counterterrorism agent with a personal destiny to save the world or die trying. He knows she's got him and he's got her and that's the way life is now. And he knows that before and after she put that gun to her chin, she's had that medallion around her neck. Christopher will deliver her to a holy death, but as long as she's alive, he'll be with her. That fight they've got to finish is more important than anything else before or after."

"event","Jimmy McCarron leaned back in his chair, staring off into space. T.J. McCabe walked through the room and glanced at him, not having to ask why McCarron was in a bizarre state of mind. Days earlier, T.J. - sober, straightened out, and now a successful SWAT cop studying for his sergeant's exam thanks to one move pulled by an absentee CTU agent - had decided to go visit his estranged brother Miles in Boston. To T.J. it was the last fence he needed to mend. 

He'd been surprised when McCarron had insisted on coming with, but then the surprise had faded and that was why he'd agreed to let his best friend come along. Jimmy partly wanted to make sure T.J. was okay, but months later he didn't have to nursemaid him anymore. No, Boston wasn't too far from Princeton, New Jersey, where Brittany now made her home. He was going to call her. He wanted to see her. To make sure this insane risk of hers had all worked out.

McCarron had settled into the role of playmaker that she'd turned over to him, and things were going decently, but the traffic was nowhere near what it had been when she had made the connections. They'd lost Tom Quinn, for one, and for two they just didn't connect so much without her there. He spent most of his time devoted back to his work as a homicide detective...but he missed the flashes of difference. Faith was in Boston, or so he heard. He wanted to see her, too. Imagined he'd have to tell her everything about the London trip, Brittany's new boyfriend, her sudden departure...didn't know what she'd say.

He sighed and picked up the phone, dialing the cell phone number she'd given him and wondering if it was still the same. Very little else was in his life anymore. Only now did he realize he cared about that."

"event","<B>What is so important to you that without it, life is not worth living? Why?</B>

It's been two days since they beat the odds and won the battle they weren't supposed to win, but two days later, Jimmy McCarron sits in the LAPD Robbery Homicide Squadroom at his desk and he is as concerned for the woman he loves as he was when they were out in the field and she had a gun to her head. Maybe even more so, because he knew what she'd do with the gun. He doesn't know what she'll do now.

He considers the evidence, like he always does, pretending it's not personal, though it obviously is. He knows her husband - her soulmate, the man she has pinned her identity to, his recent friend and confidante in the face of everything that had once been between them - didn't get on that plane coming home. He knows she locked herself in the back of the plane and wasn't heard from again until it landed. She hasn't said what happened there, but he didn't go back after her. Some might call it callous; he calls it letting her deal. He knows that she knows he is always behind her. It never has to be said or even shown; it just is what it is. They're different.

Still it concerns him. He knows how losing Michael crippled her once and how she swore - they both swore - it wouldn't happen again. He remembers wanting to kill the man for walking back into her life and turning it upside down again when he should have gotten it right the first time. He understands now the past there, but that doesn't make him accepting of it. This is too fragile a situation, this is too wrong a time for him to leave her like this. If McCarron had known what he was planning, he would have stopped it cold. But he didn't, and now Michael is gone and it could all go to hell. McCarron doesn't plan to simply lie in wait.

He's colluding with Frank Smith now, his old enemy, her old lover. It's his best move. He asked Frank to go over to CTU and see what the situation was. If he himself had gone, she would know why he had come. With Frank, it's just a friendly visit. Frank came back and reported that everything seemed to be okay, if she was a little busy. That's encouraging, but Jimmy McCarron is a born skeptic. She's too important to him for her to lose herself and for him to lose her. Like it or not, without her around, his world would be a shadow of itself and he realizes that now, with only a trace of the bitterness that once accompanied the thought.

He still loves her. He has never stopped loving her. All he did was put it aside because that's what's best for them. With Michael gone, he knows the opening is there, but he won't take it. He won't make a move as a temporary solution, won't let himself be used, won't use her like that. If he is ever to love her, it will be a lifelong thing. Not like this. But the feelings haven't died. They're just now used for other purposes. Right now, all he's concerned with is her and nothing else. He does his job, he lives his life, but she is always on his mind. Namely, what will happen to her if Michael Colefield fails her for the third time.

The old familiar urge to kill is in his veins again -- surging, crackling, sparking, burning.

And the man he once was is back with a vengeance."

"event","<B>Outside Thames House, London
MI5 Central HQ
5:45 A.M. local time</B>

Sitting in the back of the rental car, Tom Quinn folds his hands in his lap and watches Brittany Colefield and Dana Scully advance on the doorstep of Thames House. He almost wants to smile, knowing MI5 and MI6 will be thrown when the young woman they had hoped never to see again shows up on their doorstep wanting to bring the albatross of his existence or lack thereof back to center stage. There are only a few ways it can go from here. She'll either make her point and he'll be making that walk himself in just a few minutes, or it will all go to hell and he'll be heading back for the safe harbor of the United States. Tom doesn't know which way it will go.

He knows full well this game can end with his life being spent in prison or a bullet in the back of his head. In fact, when the phone call came, he assumed that to be the ending. He has done that each of the times she's called him asking for his help; he has to, because those are the stakes. He knows he's very lucky that each of the times he has violated his compact - the industrial action case, Nina Myers' return, the Code Five confrontation - he's managed to escape retribution. He doesn't kid himself that his luck will last forever. He also knows Brittany never calls on him unless she has no other choice. She is still guilty for consigning him to what seems, at times, a fate worse than death.

They have stripped him of his country, his identity, his freedom and his belief, but deep down inside, Tom Quinn is still one of the best spies the world has ever seen. Given all that Brittany has done for him - and he still remembers the shouting matches behind closed doors with lawyers, the way she sat emotionlessly at the defendant's table with him, refusing to cut him loose when she could have quit and saved herself - he sees no better use of his talents than saving her life. He understands perfectly why she has asked this time, and he knows that even if his luck runs out today, their relationship sealed his choice from the moment she called.

""You don't plan on listening to her, do you?"" he asks Jimmy McCarron, the detective sitting in the front seat, the first indication that he'd heard any of the conversation that had just happened. Briefly, Tom wonders if Michael knows his wife is in love with another man, but he knows Michael Colefield isn't stupid. Their short time as allies taught him that. He knows that McCarron, like Michael, is in this for love. Such a noble end.

McCarron shifts in his seat, glancing back over his shoulder at Tom. His eyes are hard, intensely burning, firmly set on what's ahead of him. ""I don't know. It'll depend on the situation. If I think I can save her, I won't leave her."" He pauses, taking in the spy he's worked with before but doesn't seem to know. ""If it was you, what would you do?""

""I'd listen to her."" Tom sighed. ""Knowing what I know about Harry, as soon as my name gets dropped, they'll be searching the country for me. She's collateral damage. I'd rather protect some of my agents and leave the rest to fight on than get us all strung up before the real target can even get pinned down."" He paused. ""The problem is there's too many ways it can go. It can go well, and we walk out of here together and get Lindsay. It can go badly, and you and I end up back in the States while the rest of the team goes to ground and tries to deal with both her and him. Or it can go exceptionally badly and the whole thing can be fucked. There's no way to tell, because we don't know what anyone will do.""

""That thought had occurred to me,"" McCarron agreed, eyes constantly on the move in case of a threat. ""There are too many options. Too many things out of our control."" He bristled, and Tom could see it. This was personal for him, as if the kiss hadn't been a blatant sign of that.

""We don't have the luxury of control,"" Tom informed him. ""We're fighting two fronts here. Five can come after me and her or the whole team, depending on how vengeful they feel like being. Lindsay can come after her or all of us. And if it really goes to hell and she gets strung up,"" he hesitated, ""what's to say Lindsay won't find out?""

McCarron finished a thought: ""And launch a full scale attack on MI5 to get her out.""

""Control is a myth,"" Tom repeated in the resulting silence."

"event","<B>Have you ever regretted a wish you made? 
Write a drabble on the word 'beautiful.'</B>

Thames House looms large in the distance: landmark to one friend's betrayal by his own country, location to another's attempted martyrdom. The three of them sit in the car together, staring at it. Dana Scully has already gone on ahead, perhaps sensing that they need a minute. Tom Quinn is laying low in the back seat, and McCarron, with hands firmly on the wheel, notes that the man has gotten too damn good at pretending he doesn't exist. It's almost as if only he and Brittany are there. The thought happens in his brain: <I>Maybe that's the way they were setting it up to be. The way it was pretty much supposed to be in the end.</I>

His blue eyes slide from the building in front of them to her, sitting in the passenger seat. She breathes in and out steadily, like a metronome. He surveys her, the perfect soldier. The suit that hides a SigArm P226, an Ehrlich 400, and a HALO Microtech knife, all of which she'll be asked to surrender. CTU badge folder in her right jacket pocket, he knows from memory. Wedding ring on her left ring finger. His Saint Christopher medallion still around his neck. May the patron saint of holy death deliver her to one, if that's what it's going to come to. Twenty years old with twenty-eight, twenty-nine-year-old eyes and beauty in her resolve.

""Jimmy,"" she says. ""I want to make sure we're clear on this. You take Tom and get the hell out of here. Don't come back for me. No matter what happens. That's an order. I go down, I go down. Don't come back for me. Please.""

He thinks of his conversation with Scully - the first time he'd told anyone outside of her and Michael that he loved her. Thinks of how he'd break that promise to her in a heartbeat. Yet he knows why she asked him to make it. ""I don't answer to you,"" he says, just to be itinerant. ""But I'll do what you need me to do.""

She's silent for a moment, perhaps put off by his level tone, the war-ready set of his shoulders. Jimmy McCarron is a lifetime soldier and she knows that. Her attraction to him, and his to her, is based on that darkness that they share. She could no sooner sway him than she could imagine life without him. ""You've known it was going to come down to this all along, didn't you?"" she says, looking at him levelly. ""Not this specifically, but ... You suspected this ending.""

""Yeah, I have. Why do you think I kept warning you..."" He stops himself, realizing tenseness isn't what she needs right now. ""What have I always said? It's your life, your fight. Go do what you have to do and don't apologize.""

They look at each other for a long moment, somewhere in the space of which her hand finds his shoulder and his fingers end up in her hair. He remembers then, as he does often, wishing that she'd break her engagement to be with him. He regrets that now, knowing how happy Michael has made her. They might not have that shared future that was the difference between himself and Colefield, not if she dies today, but he still knows she's best with the man that isn't him. Now he doesn't see it as winning and losing. They're all in this together.

Her lips find his and they share one last lingering, passionate, bittersweet kiss. ""I love you, Jimmy,"" she tells him as she opens the door, her hand in his own.

""I love you, too,"" he replies, not looking away, looking right at her, memorizing her. She holds his hand for as long as she can, then she shuts the door and walks away. After Scully. Headlong into that wall this time. Possibly the last time.

<I>If this is the ending,</I> he says, watching the woman he loves until she disappears and beginning the countdown in the back of his mind, <I>I have no regrets.</I>"

"event","Somewhere in the middle of the flight, he pours himself a drink.

Nobody notices as he slips to the back of the Concorde and finds the minibar - never mind the implications he can make about an Air Force jet having a stocked bar in it - and the bottle. It isn't as if he expects them to. Everyone on this flight is buried in their own personal stake. This in mind he takes a long, cold stare at himself in the nearest reflective surface. He didn't shave this morning, his eyes still seem hard around the edges, and the charcoal shirt with his collar half-cocked only makes him look more like he's falling into the mold of those well-dressed federal agents in the next room. A cynical chuckle slips past his lips as he thinks, <I>I'm sitting behind my own personal demon.</I>

Of course he would never call her that. He has names for her, other than the Christian name she was given or the title he has to use in certain situations. Words like <I>angel, innocent, martyr</I> roam through his brain when he considers her. The last one rests on the tip of his tongue, situation considered, and he glances down the aisle to see a flash of brunette hair and a head bent, no doubt over papers or perhaps a whispered prayer in progress. As he is used to by now, he feels the spark of her in his veins.

He makes no pretenses about why he is here. He's here because she believes there is a very real possibility she won't be here after tonight, and she wants to go down with the ones she loves around her, and the ones she loves will need their best to protect her. He's here because he loves her, and if he can't save her, he'll be there when she leaves him, and then he'll follow in her footsteps. Before her, all he was living for was himself and his war. Now he has a focus and he knows that what he does now is more important than anything he ever did before she showed him the full picture, simply because he's lost his heart to someone else.

McCarron pours himself the drink, shaking his head. Damn her for making it seem so grand and easy. And damn himself, in some small measure, for wanting to go over there and kiss her, an instinct he's never been able to silence every time she looks at him.

<I>One more kiss could be the best thing
But one more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve</I>

<I>In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me</I>

<I>You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am
So let me go 
Let me go</I>

<I>I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing
When I know what I'm goin' through</I>

<I>In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me</I>

<I>You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
You love me, but you don't know who I am
So let me go 
Just let me go
Let me go</I>

<I>And no matter how hard I try 
I can't escape these things inside I know 
I know
When all the pieces fall apart 
You will be the only one who knows
Who knows</I>

<I>You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am
So let me go 
Just let me go</I>

<I>And you love me, but you don't
You love me, but you don't
You love me, but you don't know who I am
And you love me, but you don't
You love me, but you don't
You love me, but you don't know me</I>

He looks down the aisle at her closed eyes and steady breathing, quashes the envy and the irony, raises the glass to his lips and takes the shot, never wavering from watching his love from this distance he supposes has little to do with physical space.

He drinks to her."

"event","Jimmy McCarron stood at the back of the Concorde, pouring himself a drink. Brittany was out cold at his and Michael's urging, and the ex-CIB agent was having some conversation with his old friend Tom Quinn, while Lex Richards was, as usual, communing with the technical gods. McCarron chuckled, unbuttoning another button on his collar. He didn't know who'd set black as the dress code, but it seemed to fit the mood well. He looked down the aisle of the plane at all of them, wondered how he'd ended up with them.

<I>I sure as hell couldn't have predicted it.</I>

Just as he said the words, he felt his cell phone vibrate against his hip. A clean motion brought it to his lips. ""Yeah."" Pause. ""Faith, what's going on?"""

"event","<B>What does the word 'love' mean to you?</B>

At this precise moment, as the Air Force jet screams into the air from LAX, love to Jimmy McCarron means being willing to step in front of the bullet that will likely be aimed at Tom Quinn when he returns to England and die for him. If he survives that, love means shoving Brittany Colefield out of the way of whatever Jacob Lindsay aims at her and being willing to die for her, which he knows in his gut he's been capable of for some time now. It's simply what this conflict demands.

Love is the word he never said until recently, and thinking on what happened, almost wishes he never said, but doesn't because he never says something he doesn't mean and owns his mistakes.

It's what he has with the woman sitting in front of him. It's being willing to kill for her and die for her. It's secrets that he's told and secrets he has kept. It's the desire to possess her and the honest fascination he has when she is unleashed. It's reading her mind, knowing the look in her eyes, feeling her under his skin.

But love is letting the woman he loves love the man she has always loved. And never letting that change his love for her or what he is willing to do because of it."

"event","<B>Describe what your ""happily ever after"" would be like.</B>

Reading the prompt, McCarron gives one of his trademark cynical chuckles. ""Brittany and Michael must be having a field day with this one,"" he says to himself, knowing that his close friends' belief in such things is the foundation of their lives and of their success. Sure, it might have been challenged, chipped and jaded over time, but it still exists. It has to, or why the hell would they ever put themselves through this? Even he himself wouldn't turn down the idea of world peace, although he lives on conflict and knows a world without conflict will never exist. After all, he's packing his bags to catch a midnight flight to London for the second huge operation in two years.

He shakes his head and spins out of the chair, making the walk from the living room to the bedroom to think on his answer. The suitcase is still sitting on the end of the bed - he's waiting for T.J. to bring the rest of everything by. McCarron's job on this mission is two-fold: not just standard muscle, but he's body man for Tom Quinn, a man who's committing suicide just by showing up in his former country. Anyone who wants Tom will have to go through him first. He knows why Brittany put him in that position. Thinking on her, he turns up the volume on the stereo, on a CD she mixed for him some time before.

<I>Oh, there must be something he's thinking of
To tear him away
When I tell him that I'm falling in love
Why does he say
'Hush, hush
Keep it down now, voices carry'</I>

Happy endings. He doesn't believe they're complete bullshit, although some of them are obvious pipe dreams. Like, no one can snap their fingers and make the world a better place. But he does believe in getting things right and being able to change the outcome to something better than what you yourself were given. He was the unremarkable middle-class suburban kid growing up in New York, not as if he's some avenging angel rising from the ashes. But he knows there can always be better. He knows he's part of a solution. If he could make things better, then he would worry about himself. There is very little he needs to be happy. As for what he wants, if it would have happened, it would have happened a long time ago...

<I>Ryan and Jenna Sheridan are on their second kid. This one's a boy, much to Ryan's amusement, named Brian, who is already being doted on by his two-year-old sister Melissa. Both of them are in tow when Jenna shows up in the Robbery Homicide squadroom. Ryan hugs his daughter and kisses his wife, and it's truly a scene out of some fairy tale that the third-generation cop has certainly earned. Nobody has to say that he's obviously hoping for a fourth generation in blue.

Smiling a little at his partner's obvious happiness, Jimmy turns away from his desk and lets them have their moment. Brittany is sitting on Frank's desk while he's in a meeting with Captain Hagermann, chuckling softly, obviously having looked past him. The ring has been on her finger for a few months now. She's the one that proposed, and he realized that he had better make official what they both already knew. It wasn't even a big deal. ""Let me guess, not in our future,"" she says, and he shakes his head. ""Would you really want to inflict me on a kid?"" She merely smiles. ""I can put up with you,"" she teases. He grins. ""Can you now?"" he quips, and is quickly silenced when she closes the distance between them.</I>

What he wants, he could never have, and he's not even sure it would work out the way he would want it to. So he's reevaluated what he wants. He wants Michael and Brittany to be happy, to have their house and their two-point-five kids, and he wants to be there with them. The three of them are bound together now, and there's no breaking the trinity that they share. It's gone beyond romantic aspirations now, and it's just as much, if not more, about accomplishing the things that lead to happy endings. All he wants, all he needs, is to stay by their side and do exactly what he's doing right now, this night.

<I>It's time now to turn around
To turn my back on everything
Everything's changing when I turn around
All out of my control, I'm mobile...</I>

Walking back to his laptop, he wonders what Brittany and Michael's answers said, knows he can go look them up whenever he feels like it, but he can guess at them. Michael wants a family, is worried about his wife. Brittany is just concerned with right and wrong, locked into ""mission mode"" with only hours before Operation Primetime goes live. She's probably talking about her values and the things she lost. They're open books for the most part, which is what makes them so powerful and yet makes their pain so crippling. On the flip side, Jimmy McCarron doesn't let anything get to him, but he knows he will never quite be what they are.

She has the balls to march into the fire and dare to ask the head of the British Security Service's Section B to reverse the delicate deal she nearly sold herself out to get. She knows it could kill Tom and land her in prison for life, but neither she nor the ex-MI5 agent are flinching. She knows there's a high-powered assassin with her in his sights, and she barely knows his game, yet she's taking the fight to him. The cost does not faze her. She has nerves of steel that some lifetime cops never develop. And Michael is standing right behind her. McCarron knows he and Mike will both lay down their lives before anyone touches the woman they both love. In this game, it could come to that, but neither of them are scared. All three of them are drawing on each other.

<I>We talk about forever, but we've only got today
And the days go by
It's all we've been given, so you'd better start livin' right now</I>

He sits there, knowing he has to come up with an answer, and types.

<I>The fight of my life.</I>

Avril Lavigne keeps blasting from the other room.

<I>It's nice to know that you were there
So much for my happy ending...</I>"

"event","<I>Written from Brittany Colefield's POV. Brittany, Michael and McCarron confront each other after Jimmy tells Brittany he loves her.</I>

It was quiet, simple, understated as love was laid to rest. After speaking with Darius, I'd come home and told Michael everything that had happened - that Jimmy had said he loved me and that I thought I loved him, too, despite the fact that I still loved Mike. I don't know what I expected, but I do know it didn't turn out like that. After a long silence where he just stared at me, Mike took me into his arms and kissed me gently on the forehead. I was shaking. He was surprisingly stable.

<lj-cut>

""Isn't this the part where you say something?"" I said quietly, almost afraid to ask. I knew I'd railed on him for deserting me early in our relationship, and frankly he had every right to do the same.

""I don't really have anything to say.""

""Mike...""

He shushed me. ""I know he loves you and he knows I love you. We talked about this after the battle. We've agreed to respect each other. That you love him ... I can't fault you for that. He's been here for you when I can't. It's a feeling, it's not something I can ask you to change. I have to respect the way you feel, and I do.""

""This is ... I'm so scared, Mike."" I shook my head. ""I don't want to hurt either of you. <I>I don't!</I>"" The vehemence of my sentence surprised even me. ""You both deserve the best of me ... I can't hurt you like this.""

He closed his eyes for a moment and held me close. ""You don't know that,"" he said. ""Because we both love you, we know the game. Call him. Get him over here tomorrow night. We'll talk about it, the three of us. And we'll deal with it.""

I made the phone call a few hours later. It took me that long to summon up the courage. Jimmy understood the situation. The tone of his voice seemed subdued compared to what I was used to, but I had to remember how much internal conflict he had gone through to even tell me how he felt. He had obviously been holding that rant down for months, if not years. The damage I had done to him bothered me. I hung up the phone and stood there in the kitchen for a moment, just wanting to cry but not being able to. Michael came up behind me and put his arms around me, telling me it was going to be okay. I wanted desperately to believe him.

""Can I just say something else?"" I said as we were laying in bed, after I'd said I wasn't going to say anything else about the whole triangle. I've been in two romantic triangles in my life, and they have both sucked. ""I owe you, Mike, for so much over these last couple of months.""

""What?"" he said, turning over and looking at me.

""You've been carrying me, I know you have,"" I continued. ""My head's been on backwards ever since the fight with Weiss. I was running scared when I quit, and I think you knew that. I think everybody knew it but me. You stood by me, you didn't judge me, but you've been doing what's best for me. You've really saved me, and I owe you.""

""No, you don't."" He held up his hand, wedding band glinting a little in the light from the window. ""This tells me that's just what I do.""

I smiled a little, as much as I could. ""How can you be this strong? How can this be so easy for you?""

""Because you made me that way."" Mike chuckled, then said in all seriousness: ""You were strong for me for four years. It's my turn to take care of you.""

Jimmy showed up perfectly on time the next evening. Nobody tried to pretend this was anything other than a frank, upfront discussion of our obviously mutual future. The phone went off the hook, though I had calls to make if I was coming back to CTU, which I didn't really have a choice about. I locked the door for some odd reason. He settled on the couch. Mike took the living room chair. I stayed on my feet. I didn't want to create a ""two against one"" arrangement, even just physically. Plus I figured I would be doing a hell of a lot of pacing anyway.

We all shared a glance, knowing it came down to what was said - not even really done - tonight.

<I>I'm comin' round to open the blinds 
You can't hide here any longer 
My God, you need to rinse those puffy eyes 
You can't last here any longer
And yes, they'll ask you where you've been 
And you'll have to tell them again and again</I>

""How have you been?"" I asked Jimmy, since nobody had an opening segue. I was worried about him anyway. Hands folded in his lap, he glanced at me. ""Largely insane,"" he commented. ""I've had a few, I'm not sleeping, and Ryan tells me I'm in a worse mood than usual. But I've just been thinking about this too much.""

""We all have,"" Michael interrupted. ""She told me what happened the other night. What you said. It goes without saying that we've got to settle this before we all lose our minds. We all deserve to be on the same page. So we'd better talk about this again.""

""Yeah, no shit, Mike,"" McCarron muttered. ""Who gets to confess first?""

I put up a hand. ""I may as well. I'm the one in the middle of this."" I took a long, deep breath, steadying my nerves. ""Mike, I fell in love with you by the end of Coventry and I've been in love with you ever since. I never stopped loving you. Our relationship has been difficult, to say the least, but we've both tried so hard to make it right, and it's finally happened. I still love you, and I wouldn't have married you if I didn't believe everything I said when we got married. I know ... I know that the truth is I'm what you have left. You gave up everything for me. I got you into CTU. I'm responsible for what your life looks like today, I know. The fact that you gave me that kind of power ... it's an honor that humbles me every day I live.

""At the same time - there were times in my life when you weren't there or you couldn't be there. Jimmy, I don't know what the fuck was wrong with you"" - this was a joke and he smirked, although we both knew the joke was bad - ""when you decided to step up, but you have always been here. You taught me about who I really am, you held the mirror up. When I'm with you ... I feel like the things I feel are okay, that I can tell you things I couldn't tell anybody else, that the darkness in me has a reason. I needed you to be there or I would've lost my mind. The passion and the intensity you bring has made me a better person, and your brilliance has saved my ass on so many occasions. But more than that there's an understanding, a connection that's been formed between us. I know how hard it was for you to say what you said, to even have these feelings. I respect immensely the self-sacrifice that took. You're in my head and in my heart, and I can't shake you. I can't. Not as if I've tried.

""I know that both of you are part of me, and I can no sooner stop loving either of you than I can stop breathing. Without either of you, I'm dead right now. And I just wish there was a way for me to give both of you the best of me, I really wish there was."" By the time I'm done, my voice was shaking, and I didn't even want to imagine what my eyes were saying.

<I>And you probably don't want to hear tomorrow's another day 
Well, I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And you're asking me why pain's the only way to happiness 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again</I> 

""Brittany, I don't think there's any doubt that you have never given any less than your best in anything. That's part of why we love you."" Michael had no doubt used the 'we' deliberately, as a signifier of sorts. ""I know that I'm responsible for a lot of things that went wrong in your life. If I'd been smarter and I hadn't been hurt so badly myself, I would've stayed with you from the beginning. I know that I was deserving of the doubt that you were feeling,"" and he nodded toward Jimmy. ""But don't ever think that I blame you or hold you accountable for who I am right now, other than what you've taught me and helped me do. I'm here because I want to be here. I'm with CTU because I can't sit on the sidelines anymore. Those are choices I made.""

""I'm grateful that there were people like Frank and Jimmy here for you when I wasn't here. You deserve to have people who can support you no matter what. The point is you're right. We made a commitment in September and that means I stand by you in every situation, right or wrong. You wanted to go to Manchester, I was going to go with you, although you're right, I did think it was a mistake and I still do. But I wasn't going to say that - as your husband, I'm on your side. That also means I respect what you two are feeling for each other, and I can certainly understand it. Speaking completely biased here, I don't see how anyone could not fall in love with you. You're a much more amazing person than you realize. You don't know the effect you have on people. That we're two of the three men who can say we love you is a blessing. Just because I was the first, I didn't expect to be the last."" 

<I>Come on, take my hand 
We're going for a walk, I know you can 
You can wear anything as long as it's not black 
Please don't mourn forever 
She's not coming back
And yes, they'll ask you where you've been 
And you'll have to tell them again and again</I>

I was numb. I hadn't expected things to be this quietly civil. I had expected maybe not an out-and-out brawl, but emotion, tension, something explosive. I wasn't seeing that from either of them at all. There was a class and dignity they had both always had that was shining through, even though they were both cut to the bone. I nervously twisted my wedding band on my finger and glanced at both of them, phrasing the question that hung in the air: ""What do we do?""

""There's nothing we can do."" Jimmy gave a cynical little chuckle, leaning forward. ""I told you to marry him and I meant it. He's your safety, your security, your stability. You two,"" he said, indicating the both of us, ""share the same future. Kids and a house in the suburbs and whatever. I don't have that, and I don't want it. I absolutely will not stand in the way of somebody else's marriage. I'm trying to get past not being with you, and it's a bitch. That's why I blew up like I did. But don't kid yourself that we would ever have what you have.""

I felt compelled to correct him: ""You also told me you'd never be in love, either.""

He rounded on me, his eyes bright and burning. ""Do you really think I'm the type?"" he said, slightly sarcastic. ""I'm a soldier. That's all I'm ever going to be. You two will lay it down eventually. That's what you were trying to do now. For me, it doesn't ever quit, and I think you know that because you've seen into me."" Then a sigh escaped his lips. ""Didn't mean to be that harsh.""

""It's all right."" I nodded. ""You're right, anyway. I was running scared. I'm not born to this life, not like both of you. But it doesn't work to walk away anymore. I tried that the year I took off for college. How long did that last before Richmond?"" I added sarcastically. ""But I see better in you, Jimmy. Better than I think even you see.""

He smiled slightly at me. ""That's just the way you are,"" he said, and he almost seemed to be proud of it. As if his true nature, or what I believed it to be, was a confidence between the two of us alone. On it all things had been built.

<I>Do you remember telling me you found the sweetest thing of all 
You said one day this was worth dying for 
So be thankful you knew her at all 
But it's no more</I>

Michael spoke next. ""I think we can agree that what's gotten us this far is the three of us working together, yeah?"" he said, and the both of us nodded. ""That's all we can do, then. Stay together, stay fighting. Respect that love brought us together and don't let it take us apart."" He looked to me suddenly: ""Do I tell Jack you're coming back to CTU in the morning?""

""Let me tell him,"" I said. ""I've got to call Josh first. And then I'll tell him. But yeah. I'm coming back. What choice do I have?""

""That's why you're here with us,"" Jimmy told me. ""It's never been a choice for any of us.""

He stood, knowing there wasn't much else left to say, and as he turned for the door he pulled me into perhaps the tightest embrace we'd ever shared in our years of knowing each other. He kissed me gently, goodnight, not goodbye as he whispered in my ear, ""You did the right thing."" Somehow, hearing it from him made me believe it. 

Michael and Jimmy shook hands, and glancing at him Michael said, ""I want you to promise me something, Jimmy.""

""Name it.""

""If anything happens to me - I want you to be there.""

""You didn't have to ask on that count, Mike."" Jimmy's gaze was unwavering and true. ""I'll see you both tomorrow,"" he said, and turned to go. I laid my hand gently on his back as he passed me by, and with one more private smile in my direction he slipped out of the apartment, leaving Mike and I standing there. The alliance was the same. The promise was the same. We'd formed our own trinity, and that was how we were going to face things from here on out. Bonded together, trusting in one another.

""That went easier than I thought,"" I said quietly.

Mike nodded. ""It's all about a little faith,"" he said. ""But I'm proud of both of you for coming to me with this. Really, I am.""

""Don't deify me yet, Mike."" I was about to say something else about dinner as I walked to the kitchen, but no sooner had I put the phone back on the hook than it rang. I looked at Mike questioningly, then answered it. ""Colefield.""

It was George Mason's voice. ""Brittany, we need you down at CTU immediately.""

""George, I don't work there anymore.""

""You do now,"" Mason informed me brusquely. ""David Newhan's just been killed. And the person claiming responsibility wants to speak directly to you.""

<I>And you probably don't want to hear tomorrow's another day 
Well, I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And you're asking me why pain's the only way to happiness 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again 
I promise you you'll see the sun again</I>"

"event","<B>What's the furthest away you've ever been from the place you were born? How did you get there? Why did you go? Did you return or even want to come back to where you came from?</B>

I was born in Savannah, Georgia, and raised in New York, so the farthest I've ever been is where I am right now - Los Angeles. As to how I got here, it is a long story which I don't feel like divulging. I got sick of the self-importance and bullshit of New York. I left. L.A. has a reputation for being a tough place to be a cop, so it seemed like a perfect fit, and truthfully it is. 

As to ever going back to New York - over my dead body."

"event","Feeling complacent after his evening with T.J. and Faith, McCarron returned to his apartment and grabbed the phone off the kitchen counter as he moved through to the bedroom. He dialed Brittany and Michael's apartment, remembering his promise to Michael from the other night. He intended to keep it, and to keep his fledgling friendship with the older man, although Faith's commentary had started to make him wonder if he had screwed up previously, a gut feeling he didn't like.

""Hey, Michael,"" he said when Mike picked up the phone. 

""Hey, McCarron. What's going on?"" Michael replied. 

Jimmy sighed. ""Nothing much. I just figured it out. There's a place she mentioned in Malibu that's still there. I'm gonna grab a friend of mine and take her up there for the night, see what I can do. I think her mind's made up, but I'm gonna try.""

""That's all we can do,"" Michael agreed.

""I know. Just make sure she doesn't have her cell phone or anything on her. We'll probably be gone most of the night. I'll have her meet me there after work."" Jimmy sighed. ""Is she around?""

""I'll get her for you. Thanks, mate.""

""No problem."" McCarron waited a moment until he heard Brittany pick up the phone. ""Hey, Jimmy,"" she said cheerily. ""How was your night out?""

""It was fine,"" he told her noncommittally. ""Listen, tomorrow night, I was thinking, you and me and a friend of mine I want you to meet - we'll hit that grand prix track up in Malibu after you get off work.""

""That thing's still there?"" she exclaimed with a childish delight.

It made him smile and laugh. ""Yeah, it's still there. Meet me there as soon as you get off. Like seven.""

""I can do that. We haven't had some good time together anyway. And I wanted to see you, before. Really, I do."" Her voice had gotten quiet.

So did his. ""Yeah, I miss you too. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?""

""I'll be there. Have a good night, Jimmy. You deserve it."" He could hear the smile in her voice as she clicked off, could imagine her running to tell Michael about her childhood paradise still existing. He would of course feign complete innocence. As for McCarron himself, he sighed and dropped the phone, staring at the ceiling. The trap had been set. He felt vaguely guilty, but at the same time, his heart was telling him this was the last move he could think of to make. If he cared about her at all, this was his one chance to prove it.

He knew what he had to do."

I was in sixth or seventh grade when I read <I>L.A. Confidential</I> for the first time. I was absolutely fucking captivated. Now the rest of Ellroy's writing seems to be self-important bullshit, but that one novel is a masterpiece. He weaves the lives of these three cops together so brilliantly. I couldn't put the thing down. I was able to see it in my head. It's still one of my favorite books. Should be required reading.

I spent my lunch in the library finishing the book. I don't want to give away the ending, but when it was over I was pretty well amped. This was what I was going to do with my life. I was going to be a cop. I was going to make a difference. That was going to be my life soon enough, albeit in a different time. I was going to be indomitable.

So of course I walked right into the library door. 

I paused, laughed at myself, and then tried the whole leaving thing one more time with less adrenaline involved.

I didn't say it was particularly hilarious."

"event","Detective Jimmy McCarron sat on the table in the bar, holding his pool cue in one hand. Anyone looking at him would have figured him for being out of the game: sleeves rolled up, collar undone, his tie at some odd angle. Yet if you looked in his eyes, their astute and intense gaze fixated on the man straddling the chair in front of him, you would know that he was still thinking like the soldier he was. ""She does what she will,"" he finally said after a long moment.

Michael Colefield nodded, resting his chin on his forearms. Up until recently these two never would have been caught dead together. Now they were friends and allies whose love of the same woman was an alliance, not a division. That was why he had come to McCarron before he'd gone to anyone else. Only McCarron was in his position. ""I know,"" he said, remembering that they had argued over this back when they had been enemies. ""And I'll support her to the end of the line, you know that.""

""But you think she's making a mistake,"" McCarron finished the rest of the sentence for him.

Michael hesitated, then sighed. ""I don't know, mate. Weiss has been after her constantly to stay, I think she's about ready to clock him. Jack told her he's losing it without her, which didn't make her feel any better. I think I owe it to her to be the person that says 'Do what you want to do and fuck the rest of it.' I mean, I know where she's coming from on this. And she's right in her logic. But I don't think she'll be happy. I think she'll miss Jack and Brian and Kim and you,"" he nodded toward the detective. ""All I know for sure is I'm her husband and that means I'm on her side.""

McCarron paused, considering what the other man was saying. ""You should've seen her that night, Mike. Gone. Dead and gone. She turned that gun on him, it was the only thing anybody could've done to save his ass. I don't know what she said to him, but after she shot him, she couldn't do anything. She didn't even talk to me."" He rubbed at his temples. ""Sucked the soul right out of her. Scared the fuck out of me, and I don't scare easily.""

""How is he, by the way?"" Michael had to ask. ""You think if he talked to her...?""

""T.J.'s thrown, man. He can't believe she did it, but he thinks she was right. He's just trying to decide who he wants to be. I think she finally slapped some sense into him. Of course, that won't help him if McNorris files, and with Brittany gone he just might finally do it. I'm the one that turned his ass in and now I'm almost wishing I hadn't.""

""Almost?""

""He was still wrong,"" was the explanation. ""Anyway, I don't think T.J. knows how to talk to himself right now, let alone her. He could try, but I think it'd just be awkward and potentially hazardous for the both of them. No.""

Michael swallowed. ""What's your gut instinct telling you about this, McCarron?""

""That I want her to be happy and if she's honestly convinced her happiness is elsewhere, then she needs to go. But that we never expected her to stay. You and I both know this isn't what she is. She was going to leave or she was going to die. We were all prepared for it. I talked to Tom Quinn the other day, he said he hadn't expected her to hang in there this long."" He sighed. ""But that I can't be her. I'm passable, but I'm not her. I don't know how she deals with people. I had one meeting where I couldn't get a straight answer and it drove me nuts. I don't have the touch she does. So if she goes, I'll be ready, and I can lead on a battlefield, but I can't play peacemaker. That's her alone."" He looked straight at Michael when he said, ""And I don't want to lose her.""

""I don't want to lose her either,"" Michael agreed. ""Although it's been said to me that now might be a good time for us to start a family.""

""You guys want kids?""

""Yeah, we do.""

McCarron chuckled. ""Something else I never could've given her.""

""I don't think it will happen, not for a while, anyway. So she doesn't have a gun in her hands. I still do."" Michael took a long drink from his beer bottle and glanced away for a long moment. ""Would you talk to her?"" he said. ""Tell her what you feel. She listens to you.""

""And she doesn't listen to you?""

""I'm not going to tell her how I feel. I'm supposed to support her unconditionally. So do you, but she listens to you anyway."" Michael shrugged. ""It's my only thought here. She has to go back in a day or two, and I'm going with her.""

McCarron nodded. ""I'll give it my best shot. I'll come back with you, take her out for a while, if you didn't have plans.""

""I haven't had time to make plans, I'm too busy worrying about all this shit."" Michael shook his head. ""I've got Mark trying to be her in CTU, you trying to cover for her outside of it, that Burroughs guy coming back in, and rumor is Nick Bryant is pissed about Jack hiring a civilian and is just waiting to come down and raise hell. Then I go home and wonder if any of this is right anymore.""

Jimmy McCarron cracked a small smile. ""Sounds like par for the course in this world.""

Michael chuckled apathetically. ""Yeah, I guess it is."""

This question was <I>made</I> for Frank Smith.

You can all shut the hell up because this isn't going to be another entry on how I hate how he always seems to be in a good mood, think he acts like a fourteen-year-old around his ex-girlfriend, or otherwise am driven up the wall by his behavior and personality. That's not what this is about.

Frank and I are just completely different people. He's an idealist; I'm a realist. He can't reach inside himself and go to the dark places - I'm not even convinced he <I>has</I> a dark place in him. My life is made up of dark places. He's still hung up on a woman who left him more than a year ago and married somebody else. I - well, I guess I'm still thinking about her too, but I don't melt when she shows up and lose the ability to speak coherent English.

And while he's being nine to five and close to perfect - because I know now he may be the golden boy, but he's not perfect - I was the one out in London playing kill or be killed with Code Fives, holding my friend accountable for attempted murder, and then going out there to keep him from blowing his own brains out. I don't think Frank could even fathom the idea of all these things I've done. He obviously couldn't quite get what Brittany had done either, or she wouldn't have come to me before him when everything got fucked years ago.

He has no concept of who I am and what I've done. I don't think he's comfortable with knowing me, and I know he wouldn't want to be me. That's fine, because while I can work with him and respect him, I'd kill myself before I became him, too."

"event","What do you do when the woman you care for leaves you?

These last two days since she's been gone have been a bitch. Everyone's in a state of denial. They seem to think she's joking, that she'll come back. I know better. I had lunch with Michael, and he says it's just a matter of time before they move from L.A. for good. He's joining her in Manchester on Tuesday. I never deluded myself that she'd come back. She's the only other person who knows what this is really like, and people like us - we're lucky to survive. I have; she didn't. I never expected her to.

T.J. is still in the hospital here in Monterey. Chris Gautreau and Tyler Culhane have gone back to L.A. but I'm staying until I'm sure the fucker is okay. He's still depressed and I think shocked as hell that she shot him. He's phoned for his brother, which is something he's never done, so I hope that's a start. But Brittany is the real casualty.

I've always thought she'd die heroically and leave me to lead. Now I know differently. She'll live and be happy, which is what I want for her. But it's still the same. She's put me in control. Years ago, after Imago Dei, we prepared a plan for her death that would tell me what to do when she was gone. That plan is the plan that's in action now. I don't get to take over CTU, but I am responsible for keeping all the pieces of the puzzle together, and that's what I'm gonna do.

I know it all now, the secrets that she never told. I know where Tom Quinn is, know passwords for the CTU computers, know her list of contacts and who knows what about whom. She made sure I was prepared. I took care of the rest. It's all in my hands now. It's the way I knew it would be. The way I know is the right way. Not that she was wrong, but that taking charge is what I'm here for.

The only problem I have is the voice in my head that misses her and won't die quietly. That, I know I can't do anything about."

"event","<B>Do you believe in the possibility of a true friendship between a man and a woman?</B>

McCarron holds the book in his hands. <I>Resurrection Men</I> by Ian Rankin. A good three to four inches thick, it's supposed to be one hell of a novel. Brittany came by the apartment earlier and gave it to him for Christmas. He hadn't expected her to get him anything (although in retrospect he should've figured it out, as generous as she is), practically having forgotten the holiday was coming. It would be another year spent by himself while his brother continued to pretend he didn't exist and vice versa. Why should he care?

<I>""I just wanted to bring your Christmas present by. You know, 'cause I didn't see you at the party..."" she said by way of explanation.

He nodded. ""Yeah, not particularly where I wanted to be,"" he replied, referring to the LAPD Christmas party that he didn't doubt Ryan and Jenna Sheridan, not to mention Brittany and Frank Smith, had all been at a few days earlier. ""No offense, but it's not me.""

""Yeah, I, um ... I didn't really expect to see you there,"" she admitted in a tone that said she'd been hoping regardless that he'd be found that evening. ""Anyway. I didn't want to forget you, before I go. You've been as important to me as anyone this year, Jimmy.""

""Thank you,"" he tells her simply. ""I'm glad that I could be there for you. We accomplished a lot.""

""We did, didn't we?"" she says, and now she can smile about it, recognize it. There isn't any more skepticism or panic or fear, just a respect for what they've done. He's helped to give her that. She pauses, ""I guess we have,"" she says. ""So: thank you for that.""

She hands him the package. ""I should get going,"" she says, leaning up to kiss him on the cheek. ""CTU's having our party tomorrow night. If you change your mind, we'll all be there.""

""I'll think about it,"" he says, probably lying. ""Take care of yourself,"" he adds for no real reason at all. ""You deserve it.""

""So do you,"" she replies, then smiles one last time, turns and is gone.</I>

He leans back into the couch, flips the front cover open and reads what she wrote there for the fourth time. A short litany of reasons for which she is grateful to have known him, talking about courage, dedication, endurance. He has no doubt that those qualities exist in her and that without him she would've found them anyway. But still, what she says means something to him, because she means something to him. He still remembers the voices of her better angels and future boyfriend telling her he was nothing but trouble and her never listening. Years later, with this peace they've finally earned, her refusal to let him go seems to mean more than it did in the past. 

She wanted him to have the hope, the future. It's not hers, it's <I>theirs</I>. That's what she's written here. That he's as entitled to that as she is and that she'd fight to ensure that he had it, never mind that he lives for its antithesis. His well-being is important to her. She treats him better than his own <I>family</I> does.

Maybe that's what finally does it.

He smiles slightly to himself, sets the book on the coffee table. After a moment, he grabs his jacket off the couch and finds the keys to the Alero, drives the half hour crosstown to CTU Los Angeles. As she said, everyone is there, this party in full motion. McCarron slips in unnoticed, hangs near her old desk, watching her talk with Lex Richards, Santa hat on her head and odd smile on her face. She's happy. She's content. And so, it seems, is he.

After a few moments she feels him watching her, gets rid of the hat and makes her way to see him. The relief on her face can't be hidden. She's surprised as all hell, and yet, she's also grateful. He doesn't ask her to explain that.

""You came,"" she says, quietly awed. ""You didn't have to do that for me.""

""I wanted to,"" he tells her, then reaches into his jacket and finds her Christmas present. He hadn't remembered why the hell he'd even bought it, hadn't expected there to be a moment like this. ""I wanted to make sure you got this.""

The St. Christopher medallion had been his at one point, when he'd still tried to sort out religion. When reality had set in, he'd stopped wearing it and it had sat there dormant until he'd come across it weeks ago. Somehow, he'd immediately thought of her. Maybe it was the fact that Christopher was the patron saint of holy death, or that he had apparently been revealed as little more than a human martyr, that had prompted him to think of her. She looked from it to him and smiled softly.

""Thank you, Jimmy. For this. For being here. For everything else.""

""You don't have to thank me."" He embraced her tightly, holding her close and feeling the happiness he'd brought her turn into peace somewhere inside of himself.

In the space of those few moments he had a chance to think about it all. He cared for her, and he always would, most likely. They had crossed the line past friendship at some point, and he believed that it was harder to turn back after that. That it wasn't if men and women could be friends, but that once they decided to be more, then the relationship changed. He knew his and Brittany's relationship had warped from the moment he'd kissed her. But after what had happened in London, he was at peace with knowing they would only ever be friends. He just wanted her to be happy. And if that meant dragging himself to a Christmas party or laying down his life, so be it.

He was someone she'd always be able to call a friend, and those were words that would never need to be spoken."

""You need to have some fun,"" Ryan Sheridan commented, settling himself on the edge of his desk with his soda. He knew better than to settle himself on the edge of his partner's desk.

Jimmy McCarron didn't look up from the case file he was compiling. ""I'm having fun,"" he said calmly, without missing a beat in his careful, steady organization. Papers were put in the right order. Notes were made where they needed to be.

""No, I mean like the fun that normal people have,"" Sheridan continued, sipping gently from the Cherry Coke container. ""You ever go on a vacation, or rent a movie, or you know, relax?""

""Not really."" McCarron closed the file, set it aside, and looked at his partner with a firm glance, knowing this discussion would not end unless he stopped it now. ""I have fun, Ryan. To me, this is fun. I avenge deaths. I lock up people who need to have their asses thrown in prison. I ensure the justice and order of the city of Los Angeles so that people who have normal lives can sleep well every night. That's what passes for engagement for me, and at least a little for you, or you wouldn't be here.""

He turned to the next file that lay in waiting.

""And even then,"" he added as Sheridan sighed, knowing the argument to be lost to McCarron's unyielding intensity yet again, ""you should know that I'm not normal.""

The two partners never spoke of the subject again, for McCarron's peace of disposition and Sheridan's safety."

Not one of those days where immense amounts of shit goes down at RHD. Because I can handle those days. Those days are not ""those days"" to me like they are to you. For it to be one of ""those days,"" it has to be pretty fucking well hell on earth.

No, it's not that.

It's one of those days where I sit back and I wonder about my regret. Singular, because I only have one, and I want it to go away more than you'd believe. I don't want to have any regrets, but I do have that one.

I wonder if when it's all said and done, years from now, I'll still wish I'd have told her I cared about her a lot earlier than I did.

I wonder if I'll still care about her then.

And I have no real clue about any of it, and I probably never will."

""So,"" McCarron said casually, crossing his legs and watching her eyes as he gestured in her direction, ""what do you believe's supposed to happen when you die?""

Brittany put down her drink and chewed her lower lip for a moment. They were having a casual lunch before she went back to CTU to do wrap-up on her latest operation. It'd been in Chicago with Tony Almeida and Julian Burroughs, and she'd ended up in Chicago Hope Hospital on the edge of death. Again. When CTU chief medical officer Brian Holt had been notified he'd had an episode, and she still wanted to take the London operation staging in two weeks. To McCarron, it all seemed just a little bit callous.

""I don't think about it,"" she told him. ""I'm an atheist, same as you are. I don't believe in God. I just have to see what happens. And I'm not dead yet, so I have some work to do.""

""Do you just expect us to all show up and cry at your funeral? Did you ever think about that?"" he asked her, his voice getting a little hard around the edges. 

She arched an eyebrow, and her voice hardened, too. ""Where are you going with this, Jimmy?""

""Damn it, Brittany, you really can't tell?"" He leaned back in his chair and stared at her, getting bitter fast and he knew it. ""You just throw yourself out there again and again. You don't even think about it or what it's going to do to..."" <I>Me.</I> ""To anyone. I'd like not to bury you before I have to.""

There was a hesitation, and then she said, ""I didn't know it pissed you off that much, Jimmy.""

""Doesn't piss me off. It frustrates me. There's a difference."" He finally looked at her again. ""I don't want to bury you and hope that you go to some grand place you deserve but that I know doesn't really exist. I want you to be happy and still be breathing. Until then, you'd better keep yourself alive. I don't think that's too much to ask of you, is it?""

She just shook her head, and he sighed and refilled her glass. She didn't look up for a long moment, and he didn't say anything, letting her have her peace. She was everything. She didn't get to throw her life away and turn that into nothing at all.

"event","<B>What do you want for your birthday?</B>

I've never really cared about my birthday that much at all. Yeah, when I was growing up and at the academy, I'd maybe go out with a few friends for a few hours. But with more important things on my mind and no one standing by, it's become irrelevant. Another year alive, another year fighting. That's what's important to me now.

It only got stranger after I met Brittany. October 19 is the day she lost a childhood friend of hers in a car accident. To her it's a day of mourning. She wants to be happy for me, but she made a promise to him to not forget, and every year she goes home to visit him where he's buried, no matter what else is happening. It's the anniversary of loss to her. I went with her this year, and I know that she'll be thinking about him on that day, and she should. We have every other day together; this is the only day she gets with him anymore.

It's not really about what I want ... it's about what I've got left to do. A day to look at the calendar and realize one more year is done and I've still got a mission left to complete. But I guess if I really had to think of something...

I'd want her to be happy.

I'd like to find some way, however backward, to let her be comfortable in her own skin on that day. To take the weight, take the pain, take the guilt, and replace it with peace, comfort, hope. She's a good woman, one of the best people I've ever known, and she deserves the best for standing by me when everyone else told her I was a lost cause to be written off or handled. No, she trusts me, she respects me, and I care about her more than I've ever cared about anyone. When she's honestly happy, part of me is happy for her. If I can give her that in the middle of all the shit we go through to save the world from itself, that would be enough for me.

And you know what?

Michael finally married her. She's been promoted to Assistant Special Agent In Charge. She's got new friends and new allies. The Code Five invasion is finally, truthfully over, and with it she and Michael can bury their shared ghosts of that and move on. I look in his eyes and I see someone different than the man I once disrespected because he disrespected her. I understand now why they're soulmates and I know they've found their way to each other. We don't need Code Black anymore. We don't need to fear anything anymore. For all of us, fighting that last engagement in London was a big turning point. Michael and I both understand that we both love her and we will both be here for her, always. She doesn't need to worry about us anymore.

She has a real chance, the first real chance in years, to honestly just live for a little while.

So maybe I've already given her what I want for her."

You shouldn't ask me that question.

In terms of retribution, the sins of Deputy District Attorney David McNorris are myriad. I don't care what Brittany or anyone else says about the man worth saving inside or the hell of a lawyer he can be, I've seen what he really is inside. How he can manipulate his own people for his own twisted ends. How he will stop at nothing to get what he wants. They tell me he's got a closet full of demons to answer to, but it's not good enough for me.

Not when I've seen him call Brittany in over and over, handing her assignments that have almost gotten her killed, knowing she'll do the job because she feels she's doing the ""right thing"" and can't look away from a problem. He's the one who sent her in after those corrupt cops, a decision which led to her having to kill a couple of people just to save herself, something which made her think she'd become a truly horrible person. It stripped a woman of great heart and talent of her self-worth and her self-respect, to say nothing of the lives it cost and the trauma it put loved ones through, and he fucking thought of the whole thing as collateral damage.

Not when he's tried to get T.J. bounced out of S.W.A.T. for things he didn't do, knowing full well that T.J.'s whole life is that job. McCabe's got his own sins, and if he fucks up, he deserves to be punished for them. If he gets fired over this bar fight, he deserves it. But to do that to him when he's done nothing wrong, knowing full well that it'll leave him with nothing and probably traumatize him for life, especially when I know he'll likely put a gun to his head hours later, is just the work of a heartless asshole out to make an example of a convenient target.

Not when I've seen him put pressure on Ryan, Captain Hagermann, even Frank. Yeah, I feel for Frank. We might not be friends, but that doesn't mean he gets to be shoved around. None of them deserve that. They're doing their job and they deserve to be able to do it. Robbery Homicide Division isn't his personal crusade, and we're not his expendable soldiers. They fight back, but they think there's only so much they can do, fearing a wrath we can't see. I don't have that fear; I never have. He wants to touch me, bring it on. He's tried often enough, and he's failed every time.

There's a confrontation on the horizon, just the two of us, no surrender, no retreat, no compromises. He and I will go head-to-head someday soon. It will be a violent, intense as all hell showdown where it'll all be put out on the table. Only one of us will be standing when it's through. 

So you shouldn't ask me that question.

Because I'm one of those people who doesn't just talk - I follow through."

"event","<B>What was the best 24 hours you've ever had?</B>

There was a chance that they were going to die.

Once they knew the odds, once the words 'invasion' and 'insurgence' had been thrown around in the Division office of Stephen Claire, it became clear to the members of Code Black that the Code Five contingent in Los Angeles was a hell of a lot bigger than a couple-man hit squad sent to take down Michael Colefield, never mind that he'd fled the country at least a month before. He was probably still the target, but they were talking about at least a dozen, if not more, against the four of them. Three to one odds, minimum.

It would have been five, but Brittany was busy running CTU Los Angeles as Acting Special Agent In Charge. McCarron had no doubt they knew about her, too, and considered her an enemy combatant given that she'd saved Colefield's life the first time out. This time it'd be up to him, alongside T.J. McCabe, Eric Weiss and Claire. He only trusted T.J., but the fact that Brittany trusted the other two was good enough. He was willing to fight with them. They argued in Claire's office for maybe an hour or two, planning and plotting, but McCarron's blood was already surging in his veins. He knew it was all buying time they were already borrowing.

He would lead them into a war for Los Angeles, and unlike Michael Colefield in London, he would not fail.

He was their leader. Not Claire, who was a former Baltimore SWAT cop and veteran CTU agent experienced enough that he was called upon in some of the most important games of state. Not Weiss, who had been part of the first encounter and had saved Brittany's own life. She hadn't asked them. She had turned to him. She had looked him in the eyes and said, ""When this goes down, and it will go down, it's not gonna be my call, it's gonna be your call."" He had not asked for an explanation. She had not provided one. He is the leader of Code Black and he will lead them tonight.

They arm up with the munitions and weapons sent from overseas and head downstairs to the van that's waiting. Their mission is one no one can ever learn about. The woman who put them together can't help them now. They know there's a chance someone will be sacrificed. No one talks about it. It's not on Jimmy McCarron's mind. He wants the next fight, the next chance, and he has the biggest one of all staring him in the face. He stares it down.

Over the next twenty-four hours they make strategic strike after strategic strike - no trial runs, no preparation, just winner-take-all, no-prisoners open combat. The United States has gone to war with Iraq, the Counter Terrorist Unit is on full alert, and he is yelling that no one leaves alive as he ducks an incoming attack in an abandoned art gallery. T.J. stumbles down the stairs, dragging his target with him, and the walls shake as one Code Five is disincentivized, but he doesn't keep score. He'll do that by how many people are breathing at the end.

Weiss loses his target, yells for someone's help as the Code Five leaps through a plate glass window to the alley below. McCarron is closest and makes a running jump before anyone can tell him not to, not caring if he gets hurt in the three-story drop. He lands on his feet, fires two shots without looking that hit the Code Five in the back. He stands firm in the face of the explosion that follows, his heart pounding methodically, his blood pulsing with the rush of adrenaline that sings inside of him. He has never been this alive.

The situation repeats itself time after time in the space of this day. It is just before two a.m. Thursday when he phones her from the van, bruised and bloodied but resolute as Stephen Claire sits in the van tending to a massive wound in his arm. He tells her that this is their last move, that they are well aware that this is the nerve center and that they may not get back alive. She tries to say something, but he cuts her off. He doesn't want to hear it. He hangs up and looks at the others behind him, hurting badly. They wonder at his coldness. They don't know that Jimmy McCarron lives for the fight, is driven by the relentless, righteous intensity for justice that is in his head and in his heart, that he pushes hard for and yet almost fears the day when the fighting is done. They don't know that in fighting he finds himself. They may never know, but he doesn't care. Everything else is secondary to the fight he's been fighting his whole life, of which this is just the next, largest, most important chapter.

When their backs are to the wall ten minutes later he faces it like birth. Blood is down his face and in his mouth and he's in the middle of it. This is the fiercest fight he has ever been in and he feels better than he ever has, despite the fact that each moment is borrowed time. If he goes down, he will go down hard and take someone with him. All the ferocity, all the righteousness, all the intensity blazes and burns in him, pushes him forward, pushes him harder. The others may taste only the pain, but it's all within him now, and he focuses it and makes something of it. They may keep coming, but he has never feared his own death.

And in the middle of that there's the moment of heroic clarity. He knows they're outnumbered, and he thinks through the eyes of the woman that would have been their leader. He pushes past his own dislike of the man to call Frank Smith and have him summon her. 

What he doesn't expect is that she'll come running fully intent to be the sacrifice he suspected was coming. She'll throw herself down upon the altar and she will scream for him to get the hell out and save himself, and that's when he'll make the choice she would have made, take the control in spirit as well as force. For this night, he will own fate. He will summon more than he thought he could be and he will save her life. He will defy her and defy the sacrifice and the intended order of the world by willpower alone. He will assert himself as a leader and a hero and on his shoulders they'll find the victory resting. It will end because he decides it will end.

When he's standing in the hallway as she lays on the operating table, considering life and death and how much it all means to him, he'll know he has never been so alone, and he has never been so alive."

"event","<B>What was the biggest lie you've ever told? What were the consequences?</B>

Jimmy McCarron doesn't lie unless he has a damn good reason to do so. He's lied to murderers, murder suspects, witnesses that need coercion, but that kind of deception is part of his job. Otherwise, he unflinchingly tells the truth, whether you're prepared to hear it or not. It may have alienated people over the years, but that's the price you pay. It's reality, and it should be faced, not handled, in his eyes.

So the only severe lying he's ever done has been to himself.

He insisted for the better part of a year and a half that what he felt happening inside of himself wasn't love, wasn't attraction, when he knew damn well that was what it was. He fought against it, telling himself that it would only expose vulnerabilities he could not afford to have. There were justifications for his silence as she went back to Michael Colefield, a man he'd only ever seen as trouble. He always had his reasons why, the most prominent being that this wasn't supposed to happen.

McCarron lied to himself right up until the point where he saw the engagement ring on her finger. And he lied to her right up until the night before her marriage.

By then the fates were already cast. Both of them, believing in marriage and fidelity, would never consent to her leaving her fiance at the altar, especially when said fiance was a man with little else concrete in his life but her. By then, he'd seen what she saw in Michael and understood that yes, he was worthy of her, maybe he had been all along. He told her that for her future, she needed to follow through. He told her he knew what it meant.

She married Michael the next day, while he looked on trying to pretend it didn't hurt him inside. Over the months since, the pain has died but it will never fade. It was too brutal, too long in denial, for that. He didn't make his move because it was a battle he never wanted to fight. He knows now the consequences of losing when she leaves him after every day or case or lunch meeting. He'll never get to be the one she comes to, just the one she leaves.

He accepts it, knowing he brought that on himself by the one lie he ever told."

I don't do well with talking about my personal life. Leave that to Brittany, the professional writer, or Frank, who used to spend a lot of time taking her to John Cusack movies, or any of them. They can articulate their thoughts and feelings. I just turn it all into statements of fact.

""I need you,"" I told her before I kissed her. 

That night, that night I'm going to remember for a long damn time, for the first time I was hoping she'd leave him to stay with me, not just leave him because it was right for her. 

But it wasn't right.

""Your best future is with him, not with me,"" I told her before she married him.

I don't regret either sentence. They weren't verbose, they weren't beautiful, they weren't compelling and I doubt they'll be remembered. But they were the absolute, unflinching, unfailing truth that was in me, and that's all I've ever said and all I ever will say.

Things have turned out right in the end, after all. At least for her, and that's what matters."

"event","<B>What makes you feel vulnerable, and what makes you feel invulnerable, and why?</B>

Jimmy McCarron didn't consider his vulnerabilities until he was taken under by the biggest one of them all.

He was human; he had vulnerabilities and he knew that, and with a certain Zen philosophy he learned what he could and how to defend against them. In fact, he knew himself with a clear-cut precision that was disturbingly like he was talking about someone else. He could anticipate his moves like a chess player, know his emotions like the back of his hand, and that made it easy to handle the flaws in his life without too much collateral damage. No one weakness could be exploited for little more than a moment of hatred, a random obscenity, or maybe an unconscious form hitting the floor. It was something he had worked very hard on, a very fine bridgework he was proud of.

Then he fell in love.

She was his vulnerability now, or she was molding them under her careful, idealistic hands. Her more acceptable, more perfect qualities were slowly stripping away his necessary, unconventional traits with each encounter. He could never be like her, but being with her made him want to try, and that made him weak. He needed to be able to be drastic, to be violent, to be tough if it was necessary to do so. Yet the more he was with her, he wanted to fall in line, to find simpler solutions, to compromise. He saw in her first the darkness, but now she was finding herself in him and he had to deny her if he had any hope of being the man he had to be.

Of course, he had never asked her about any of these things. She would likely say it wasn't so, or try to accept him as he was, against her better instincts. He knew her about as well as he knew himself, and she would always be ruled by her more acceptable half. She could never drop the mask she played by and she would therefore never know the rules by which he had to play his role.

So they moved together and apart, McCarron and the woman he loved, philosophy in their affair. Slowly now more of his drastic actions were for her victory or her revenge. Subtly now she would unleash the pain he had taught her to hold on to for moments when she needed to be tough or face the consequences. While she began to lose her grace, he began to find his. This disturbed him the longer it went on, because they could not be the same person, lest they both be lost.

She made him vulnerable. In everything else, he was as invulnerable as a human being could be. In love, however, he would always be vulnerable. And he was tempted closer to vulnerability every day."

He thinks the first time could have been after Michelle, but he's not sure. There have been too many times for him to bother keeping track of them all. He remembers every moment, but not what has come to be a small reparation at the end of each of them.

McCarron's never thought that much about his life with the bottle. He's not an alcoholic, and that's not denial; he knows very well the consequences of drinking too much, and moderates accordingly. A lot of nights he doesn't touch it. If he should need it, he can hold himself to one. In the very worst of situations there might be two or three. He's never been wasted. It's a very measured situation, because he knows what he can take, even if he ignores that knowledge where everything else is concerned.

This casual drinking has suited him well. He may have one if he goes out with his partner, but it mostly confines itself to his apartment, after hours. That's because when he drinks, there's a reason <I>why</I>.

There's thinking that needs to be done, temperance that needs to be had. There's a suspect he almost assaulted because he's complicit in the burning death of a teenage girl. There's a friend who's lying in a federal infirmary because she intended to sacrifice her life on his behalf. These moments demand measure and contemplation, and when he's sitting on his couch with the stereo wrenched up, nursing the beverage that does little to impair him, there is nothing else but that. 

There are reasons to go there. For others, it may be drunk to the point of blackout, but for Jimmy McCarron, who always has his reasons why, it's just something he does when he stares himself in the face.

McCarron and Brittany take a SWAT examination.

<lj-cut text=""Sight"">

T.J.'s not there when they arrive at the mock building course. He was supposed to be one of the team members on this prep course - it was part of why they both signed up for it. McCarron doesn't call. It's not his place, anymore. He just suits up. He and Brittany will go this one alone.

""You wonder where he is?"" she asks as she adjusts the bulletproof vest.

He tests the feel of the assault rifle on his shoulder. ""Not really."" T.J. now is a mere spectre in the back of his mind. The lingering darkness beyond his vision. The physical manifestation, the body memory, of life gone wrong.

The other team member who's not T.J. - somebody named Sanchez - sets them loose. For McCarron, it is a fairly easy transition as his brain clicks over past its own imposed limits. He knows Brittany is looking for rationalization. Grabbing her hand pulls her beyond that. When they're down behind the first barricade he's close enough to whisper in her ear.

""You and me, okay? That's all there has to be.""

She nods, readjusting her grip on the handgun she chose to stick with. ""I go down, I go down, you hear me?"" she tells him, sounding surprisingly assertive. ""You don't protect me. You don't come back for me.""

He gives her a barely imperceptible nod. It's as close to a promise as he'll get.

A three-count and they're up and firing. He's surprisingly fast, chillingly accurate. Maybe it's T.J.'s lessons that it did it. After a moment more, she's gone, covering his next angle. He watches her reload, one violent slam of a new clip into the weapon, another target. 

There's always another target; she has made a living out of taking them down, if not of being one herself. Maybe she doesn't kill them, maybe she can't, but she knows when to pick her shots. That's the thing with her. He can see the wheels turning in her mind as the bullets fly loose.

As he squeezes the trigger, McCarron knows he'd break that promise in a heartbeat.

He moves to his next target. There's always another target.

He's made a living out of taking them out for good."

"event","<B>If you won the equivalent of $2,000, and had to spend it, what would you spend it on?</B>

Jimmy McCarron's first thought - after rolling his eyes - is what Brittany would do with it. Not because he cares about her, for once, but because he knows she's always been on top of CTU's financial affairs. It's her job, to keep the place running, and he knows she knows the inside of what it really costs for people like the two of them to keep on fighting.

He knows, with an amused little smile, she probably turned around and put all of it right back into the CTU system, or charity, or something that wasn't her.

So he makes his first decision: to go and find her something for all the times she's given up what she had for other people. The obvious choice involves baseball, as he knows she and Frank have been going to Padres games together even after the split. There was something she made reference to once - an Adam Eaton jersey that was going to run her something like $350 that she couldn't convince herself she needed that badly. It's small compared to all the things she's done for him, but if it makes her happy, that's all he cares about.

As for the rest of it? He supposes he owes his partner for putting up with him over these years, which isn't an easy thing by anyone's standards. If there's something he can do for Ryan and Jenna, they've only got to name it. Captain Hagermann, too, for the leadership that often goes unnoticed in the storm that days with her detectives can often become.

They've done their part of the work - now it's his turn."

"event","They took separate cars to Hollywood and Highland. Frank couldn't stand being in the Alero with Breaking Benjamin screaming on ""Sooner or Later."" McCarron couldn't stand being in the car with Frank. This kept them silent as they met each other and Frank led the way to The Highland. All the while, McCarron was trying to figure out what his game was.

The nightclub, at least that's what it was called, was actually resembling more of an Olive Garden. That seemed redundant, as according to Frank's pointless commentary an Olive Garden already existed on the premises. It was where he'd taken Brittany on their second date, but he didn't say that because he rightly figured McCarron didn't really want to hear anything about people who weren't him. He'd gone through that phase himself.

She was waiting for them just off the door, in the shade of the entryway where she'd once been standing during her tryout for that ESPN reality show. She didn't really talk about it, but it had been one of those things she'd done when she'd had a normal life. Frank hugs her tightly, kisses her on the cheek; Jimmy lets him have his clingy moment before giving her shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

Brittany pockets her sunglasses and looks at Frank with an impish smile. ""You got him to come. I'm impressed.""

""Hey, for you, I'll try anything once.""

McCarron looks at them both. ""Why am I here?"" he interrupts bluntly.

""Is it a crime to have the two of you both out with me at the same time?"" She laughs a little. ""Because I asked, Jimmy. And because I've got some stuff to say I think you both might want to hear.""

They head into the restaurant and end up at a table by the badly-lit bar. Brittany takes the chair between the two of them; so old instincts haven't completely faded. She'd still rather have her and a table between the two of them. Frank doesn't notice, but McCarron applauds her intelligence. Frank Smith is not his friend, and they'd both do good to remember that.

""We got a new CIA A.D. today,"" she tells them, sipping at her water. ""Met with him this morning. Richard Durant, out of Operations.""

Frank is curious and concerned at the same time. He doesn't know the first thing about intelligence, even after all these years. ""What's that mean for you?"" he asks her, chin on his forearms, looking at her with piqued eyes. It's charming in a pathetic way, McCarron thinks, how he loves her still, in that clingy sense.

""Don't know. The guy knows what he wants and how to get it. Either he's going to help us or hurt us, but I don't see there being a middle ground."" She swallows. ""The point is I don't know how he's going to react to me working with you guys, with everybody else. If he wants me to focus within the Agency, I've gotta do what he says. We're on thin enough ice already.""

McCarron interrupts, ""You seriously think he's gonna pull you?"" with an amount of incredulity. Anyone who's seen the reality knows her bringing the L.A. community's figureheads together has done wonders for the city's law enforcement structure. Remove her, and Deputy D.A. McNorris never gets on the same page as RHD. Remove her, and he's killed Frank by now.

""I have no fucking clue. The man scares me. Well, not scares, but he's off-putting."" She sighs. ""Ex-MP, ex-internal. And it's like he knows way too much about me. He knew who to talk to and what to ask them. He knows the way it goes.""

The RHD detective nods. ""Just means the playing field's finally level.""

Brittany has to admit, as she stares uncomfortably into her water glass, that he's right."

For this small section of time, no bodies are falling. No police dispatchers are putting out any calls for a Robbery Homicide Division detective. There's no one he needs to yell at in an interrogation room. For about twenty minutes now, he can relax and work on other things deserving of his attention.

""Interesting reading?""

McCarron looks up with an arched eyebrow to see Frank Smith standing in front of him. He reflects then that it was much easier to deal with these situations when they hated each other, making snide comments and heated glares their language. These days he doesn't know what the hell Frank wants, and Frank's ever-composed attitude could mean anything. Inwardly, he rolls his eyes.

""Yeah, it is. What do you want?""

""Brittany and I were going out for a late lunch. I thought you might want to come along.""

Now McCarron's brain temporarily freezes. Is this Frank Smith, golden boy of Los Angeles RHD and general Boy Scout, actually <I>inviting</I> his former nemesis along on a get-together with his beloved ex-girlfriend? Never mind what the rest of the universe would think, this sentence is a freak aberration of everything about their uneasy relationship. He's still trying to deduce this as he formulates an answer.

""Frank, what the hell?"" he finally just says.

Frank obviously didn't expect that one. ""We're going to lunch at The Highland. She asked how you were. I didn't see any reason why you couldn't be there. You want to come?""

""This isn't some sort of personal thing between you two?""

""We're having lunch, we're not discussing world peace."" It's a decent dose of sarcasm, which is a huge risk in talking to Jimmy McCarron. The fact that Frank is willing to employ it signals to McCarron that he's genuine. Finally, McCarron sighs and puts down the book. ""Fine, I'll be there. What time are you leaving?""

""About half an hour. She's meeting me there."" Smith turns to head back to his desk. He almost looks like he wants to say something else, but he doesn't. McCarron stares at the back of his head. This cannot be happening.

There's something going on here."

Are you fucking <I>kidding</I> me?

I've lived with this cross to bear for Brittany for two months and eighteen days now. July 14 was when Michael proposed - the day I looked in the mirror and realized I'd let myself fall for her. And September 20 she married him after I literally kissed her goodbye and told her she didn't need to worry about me. It should be over, but it's not, because neither of us treat relationships with anything but the weight they deserve. 

I've almost gotten used to Frank treating me with some empathy. We've agreed to go our own ways, rather than murdering each other, but in this he understands, because he's been there. He lays off on anything that could piss me off. He and I share the same wound. I'm sure his has faded to an abrasion - or maybe it'd heal if he stopped touching it - but they're there. Frank Smith is looking through my eyes, and I'm looking through his. Hell's frozen over, and I owe that to his ex.

Caring about her in this way is suicide. Of course, I knew that when I admitted it to myself, so it's not like I've got any reason to bitch. She's got a ring on her finger, which she always wanted, but which I could've never given her. She's got a guy who might not be completely capable of loving her like she deserves, but who wants the family she might someday want, which I'd have no part of. Provided he doesn't fuck up this chance like the two before it, he should give her the secure, domesticated life she'll be quite happy with. Of course, if the voice in my head is right and he does eventually screw up, you can bet I'll be there for the due retribution.

Sometimes I don't know why, though. I think about the way it could have gone if she'd forsaken him and taken up with me, and I know what it would do to me. It's the death of <I>both</I> me and Colefield if he loses her.

A few nights waking up beside her and I'd be thinking about her lying there the next time it came down to me laying my life on the line. A couple of stolen kisses or a lost embrace and the next time I need to clock a perp, maybe I hold back. A night or two out at the Pier with her and maybe I start believing in that idealistic daydream of hers. That's her, but it's not me. It's everything I can't be if I expect to continue to be the person I want to be. So instead of that long death I'm carrying this heartache, which doesn't make me stronger.

It just reminds me of what I'm missing: a slow, painful death ... that is still somehow worth it."

She tells us all she's going to sacrifice herself in exchange for the life of her friend.

I end up at the Pier, standing there considering that I'll never see her again. While the work she and I have done together is successful I'm kidding myself if I think it couldn't be duplicated. Maybe not exactly, but there's someone out there with the experience. That's not really what I'm concerned about. It's always been about the work, but for four years she's almost been another partner. For all the bullshit in this line of work, I've believed in partnership. If she asked me to go in there and kick this guy's ass, you damn well bet I would. But she won't ask, and that's her choice.

She's killing me.

Four years is a long time with a woman like her, when she makes every day have to be important in some way. I don't really give a damn, outside of cases put away, but she does. Everything is a statement. Everything has a purpose. It used to make me irritated until she grabbed me and dragged me into everything she does. I suppose when your boss saved a President and you work for a federal unit that plays against the rules, you get a lot more invested. Then instead of her calling me, I'm calling her. Instead of moonlighting as her backup, I'm part of her team. She gave me a fight, and I can never resist that.

She's broken me.

When I'm around her I don't want to fight as much. I can hold her and not be ashamed of it. I believe in some of the things she says and want to believe in the parts I would have laughed at before. I want to tell her things I would have taken to my grave. The things that seem right when I'm with her seem wrong elsewhere. There are times I believe I am losing my identity, being with her. She can mold me into someone calmer, less confrontational, with more hope. I think about not being able to be who I am and I don't know if it's worth it. Then I think about her, at home with her fiance, and I want to be where he is. I want to be anywhere she is.

I can still feel her kiss on my cheek.

She'll never know what she's done."

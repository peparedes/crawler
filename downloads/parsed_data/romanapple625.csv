"event","i haven't updated this thing in a long time. just thought i should catch up with some people that i miss because i haven't seen any of you in such a long time and that is just craziness because we live, seriously, about two feet away. 

i haven't been doing much out of the ordinary or of much excitement lately just working and well, working  is pretty much it.  

the apartment is great! i love being able to just go home and chill in my own house; it is quite refreshing if i do say so...and i do.  

so, i don't have a wireless chip in my computer yet, but hopefully i'll be getting one soon so i can be online! (though for a time it was nice without access to the highly developed, civilized world of the www...however, i'm ready to jump on the bandwagon once again; oh what a wonderful luxury the internet is hmmm)

we have a whole shitload of jungle juice gahh and a ton of beer from teaspoon in the fridge; it's pretty much taken over the whole thing, no room for anything of substance in there; only alcohol, but who needs food anyway, right? no, seriously, we need to finish that up so anyone, anytime is welcome to come over and veg...or PARTAY! come on down.

sir charles is almost done with his paper so i must leave now, but hello to everyone and hopefully my internet will be up and running soon!

p.s celia i need to wrap my finger in string or something so i remember to call you!
NICOLLE! how are you enjoying life overseas?! i haven't talked to anyone in FOREVER; we must chat. : )

byee loves.

"event","In Letters to a Young Poet Rilke talks of finding solitude and using it to find one's inner self with the purpose of centering one's thought around writing.  i  find solitude now more than ever.  before, i knew solitude by the breathtaking views a top a summit or by a simple run or walk in the woods; now, i find myself in desperate solitude, alone. to write of love is to achieve pure, disgusting sappiness, but when love is gone writing of it seems foreign and abstract.  Thousands of faces, smiles and eyes, all blank, as if trapped in a new age horror film, i see only blurs.  truly i had never known love as that before; too perfect, too right to be so much as desired or tasted by my ""luck"".  it was destined to end this way. if only we'd come to reconcile hurt sooner, to realize our differences before we'd come so far.  to some seems strange to think of years in months, but in all truth we'd learned and loved more of eachother in what seemed like three years than most learn in a lifetime together.  people never change, nature cannot warrant it.  so love is gone, perhaps forever. je me souviens."

this weekend was amazing. josh and i went to see phantom of the opera for our 3 month anniversary and then we walked back to albany in the snow! :) soo much fun! 

i've been away from my dorm room for so long it seems crazy, i don't even ""live"" there anymore, i'm either with my friends, or with josh.  my dorm is just a place for all my useless junk.  interesting way of putting it i suppose...

it is currently 8:45 in the morning and i'm still up from last night.  me, vicky, and steph pulled an all nighter (something new and different right?) and then went to breakfast.  i'm still pretty much wide awake, but i sense a bit of drowsiness, which is most likely to creep up on me in the middle of my block of classes, 11:30-3:45, yeah...i'm pretty much screwed, and rightfully so.

"event","i fucking hate this day.  i haven't had this sucky of a day in forever; i suppose i was due...

first off i slept over at josh's last night and planned on getting up at 7 to go back to strose, didn't end up getting so sleep until 5 in the morning! and i didn't get to strose till 10:30...no sleep for abbey :(

so i'm riding the bus back to strose and my mom calls me. (oh yeah, i wrote her this email telling her that i changed my major and stuff and she wrote me back saying she was fine with it...)so, i thought she was going to talk to me about bringing the car over so me and josh can go see reel big fish tonight...nope. boy was i wrong.  she's like ""abb, me and bjorn have been seriously discussing the decision you've made to change your major, and we've been giving it some serious thought, we don't think you're doing the right thing...blah blah blah"" so bjorn gets on the phone with me and starts talking my ear off about how i'm such a talented musician and there's a future in the music industry and that if i get out of it now there's a huge possibility i won't ever be able to get back in if i wanted and that if i'm serious about becoming an english major then i would have to transfer to a less expensive school.  what the fuck! more on that later...

went to theory to find that i got a fucking 43 on the test i took last class. fuck. i fucking hate that class, the professor...grr.  that's what i get for staying up all night studying and attempting to take the test while hyped up on caffeine pills! fuck me!

so today i'm supposed to register for classes at 10 am right? so, i get out of class at 12:45 and decide to do it then only to find that i owe a fucking library charge for this lame book on globalization that i didn't even end up reading...so whatever, i walk over the library and they end up charging me $2.10!! ok fine.

so then i try to register for my classes and i can't, why you ask, because i have a fucking immunization hold on my account! so i walk down to health services, thoroughly pissed i might add, and tell them i can't register, blah, blah, sob, sob. so the lady looks at me, smirks, and tells me to fill out this form for a menagitis shot.  so i fill it out, leave it with her and get back to the library to attempt to try and register, again.   

only, i still can't! because the fucking health services lady is too lazy to get off her ass and get the paper i just filled out! who knows how long it's going to take her to straighten things out. i really hope that was the only problem too, or else i will seriously consider jumping out my four story dorm window.  

this day can kiss my fucking ass."

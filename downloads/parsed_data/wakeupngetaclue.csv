"event","""Beautiful Mistake"" -Ataris

Maybe I'm not ready for this
And you know it
Maybe I'm too scared to tell you 
What I'm really thinking
It's not fair to stay together
Because of the regrets we might have

Don't want to fall asleep alone,
but do I want to wake up with you?
I'm only trying to be completely honest

So I guess this is the ending
Of a beautiful mistake
And if we both agree that we shouldnt be
Together why does it
Hurt so much and I feel
Like I lost my closest friend

Don't want to fall asleep alone,
but do I want to wake up with you?
I hope your happy, and completely lonely

There I am, standing on all alone On St. Lee Harbor bridge
And you know I would jump into The fucking ocean
If it mean I was truly capable Of being satisfied
Will I ever be?
Did I just give up the best thing I ever had?

Don't want to fall asleep alone,
but do I want to wake up with you?
I hope your happy, and completely lonely
Don't want to fall asleep alone, 
but do I want to wake up with you?
I'm only trying to be completely honest



If you only knew how bad I hurt, how much I've cried. I left him tonight truly good and forever. He threw me up against the wall and hit me again and again and then when I fell on the floor he got on top of me and tried to hurt me. I bit him to try to make him stop so I could escape, so now he's saying since he has marks that I started it. HE WAS GOING TO MAKE ME DROP TOMMY! Dear God, I love him so much but I won't have that anymore. Then he broke my phone AND the house phone when I was trying to call for help when he blocked the door. But my heart hurts more than my body. I would love to die right now, were it not for my little sunshine.

Tommy is 2 weeks old as of October 5th. He's now 20.5 inches and weighs 8 lbs. He was born on September 21st, was 20 inches long, and weighed 7 lbs 4 oz. He is the sweetest little baby ever, and I love him with every ounce of my being, and I would do anything for that little ray of sunshine. You can see his picture at http://www.growingfamily.com/webnursery/babypage_view.asp?URLID=0P2U8K4L0R look at the 4th pose, he looks SO incredibly adorable. He's blowing a kiss!

I'm looking for a job once again, cause I quit because Juan didn't want me to work. Now he's fucked up my whole life.

And it sucks because as pissed as I am, I still love him.
With all of my heart.

Later, Maureen"

"event","ONLY 8 MORE DAYS until Tommy Xavier Yzaguirre is due! Although Mama thinks I still have 2 weeks, because she says it doesn't look like the baby has dropped. The doctor says he already did.... but I don't think he has either. I'm now dilated 1 cm.

Jay is taking his school pictures today. I put his new Mickey Mouse outfit on him to wear today, and he got a haircut yesterday. He looks ABSOLUTELY adorable! :)

Last night I dreamed (for the second time) that I was having contractions. And then when I actually woke up, my stomach was all hard and it hurt really bad. Maybe it was a Braxton-Hicks one? I lost my mucous plug already. THINGS ARE MOVING ALONG!

I must go, have pictures to pick up from HEB.

I LOVE MY LIFE.

"event","Today is Baby J's birthday. He's 4 years old today!! Poor little guy, he's been sick with bronchitis for the past 6 days. And guess who's taking care of him 24/7? ME. All Juan does is drug him up with medicine to stop the cough, which is making it worse because he needs to cough all that crap up. So I get stuck with all the after effects. Yay. He better call me Superwoman from now on, though. I've slept a whole 6-7 hours since our little boy has gotten sick.

We're having a party for him on Sunday. It's theme is Racecars (Hot Wheels). He chose it cause he wants to be like Daddy. :D

I had a doctors appointment yesterday, and she said that I'm barely thinned out and that I'm half a centimeter dilated. IT HAS BEGUN! I now weigh 153.4 OMG I'M A COW. And with my luck, I'll just lose 5 lbs. of it after I have Tommy. :|

Anywho, I'm job searching at Wells Fargo so I must go for now {using the computer at the library - time limited}

Until next time,
Maureen"

Felix... When you said ""what happened in the past needs to stay in the past and forgotten... well at least some of it...."" well I was wondering what you didn't want forgotten?

As in the news department, my baby is clearly moving down. I can almost lay my hand flat right under my chest. I weigh 152 now. Dear Lord I'm obese! It's so weird cause everything got bigger... my boobs, my stomach, my butt, my thighs. It's just weird feeling this big. You know when you put shoes on that are like 10 times too big? That's what I feel like.

Juan and I had a long talk last night. I think we understand each other a little bit more now. He says he's putting off marrying me cause whenever something really bad happens between us I pack my stuff and leave. So I told him why I do that and exactly what he can do to make me stop.

Happiness is a warm gun.

Let's say goodnight and stay together,
MAUREEN"

The second thing I do in the morning is...

THAT IS SO SILLY. THAT IS WHAT MY SILLY GOOSE SMELLANI DOES. heehee :D

Me and Juan had an argument, so I'm not going to take Baby J to the school to meet his teacher. Juan never appreciates anything I do for him anyways, so he can start taking care of his own son. Since he's not ""ours."" And I'm going to the childbirth class tonight WITHOUT him. Since it doesn't look like he's going to even be there for the birth of Tommy. At least Mama and Melanie will!

In response to those comments Felix, you know it still DOES hurt whenever I think about you. I really did love you, and it hurt so fucking bad when all was lost. And I really thought that you and me were going to get married and have little Ziviela. Life was going to be good. I still think about you... certain smells and places and even people remind me of you. And, I don't know, I guess it burns me when all you speak of is how much hate you have for me. I never wanted for you to hurt, and I'm sorry if you still do. (Funny to hear ME say sorry, right?) But that truly never was my intention.

"event","ALOHA dear acquaintances! You have missed me, no?

Today Valerie (from Chick-Fil-A) called me and said hi and that she missed me and Juan. And her and Jessica (another girl from Chick-Fil-A that I always hated when she was around Juan) went by Juan's house today (how they know where we live, I don't know. I think I'm gonna ask him later). Anywho, they said that since we've left things have just gone to crap and David talked to Juan and said that if we want to go back, then show up at 11am tomorrow morning to talk to him. Juan asked me what I wanted to do, and I told him that the only reason I left in the first place was because of him. So he wants to go back. It better be permanent. Maybe we could actually afford the things we need though.

I'm drinking Slim Fast Optima. Yummy. I used to drink this every morning and every night. I should really consider buying some for my house heh :D

Juan's mom is having a baby shower for me on August 13th. We registered at Babies-R-Us yesterday. It's getting so close, and we STILL haven't found a name for the baby!!!

Today was a bad day at Sea World. That's all there is to say about that. Otherwise, it's cool and really easy.

More later, you non-silly peoples.

I was lonely during my lunch hour cause Dacey wasn't there to eat with me. And I don't know anyone else. Besides, anyone who knows me knows I'm not exactly the most social person. Anywho, work was easy.

Juan works 5pm-12am tonight. So I didn't get to see him at ALL today. That royally sucks.

Thurs 3pm-11:30pm
Fri   3pm-11:30pm
Sat   6pm-11:30pm
Sun   1pm-9:30 pm

That schedule royally sucks. But I have no choice.

Mel's a goose and she's eating her phone. She's a NASTY GOOSE. I sound stupid. That's the only mention you GET then TURD. TAKE THAT!@

Dear God, I've gone nuts.

I must go and be a lil goose now. Or maybe a big one. My stomach is morbidly obese, and the fetus inside me is just moving SO much. I love my baby. I want to hold him and see him already!!

"event","Today was orientation! It lasted 5 hours (from 9am to 2pm). The trainers were pretty cool, and actually funny. They shared a bunch of personal stories, so that was interesting. I'm going to be working at the Main Mast (the gift shop by the main entrance). We train for the registers tomorrow from 1pm-4:15pm. Yip! Pay is $5.20 so umm yea... and when you work overtime you don't get paid time and a half so that blows balls.

Juan's at work again, from 5-12. He works from 12-5 tomorrow, so I don't know who's going to watch Baby J while we're both at work.

I love Juan, really and truly do. Even if he does have a bald spot on the right side of his head. He's very self-conscious about that, but I love everything about him. He doesn't believe me, and tries to hide under a hat. It's funny.

We watch the Discovery Channel every night. This week is shark week. It's fascinating!

Mama is SO drunk she's stupid.

We're gonna go home in a little bit.

"event","Well, tomorrow is orientation at Sea World. The pay sucks, but Dacey works there too so that will be cool. Hopefully I can get me, Juan, and Baby J in for free. We want to take him there and let him see all the cool animals and shows.

Juan has been letting me have my freedom since I packed my things and told him that although I love him and always will, that I simply refuse to live under his rules, because I should not be under him. I should be equal - it's OUR relationship right? So things have been REALLY good lately. I love him, and he's proving he loves me too. He even talked to Goose on the phone for like 5 minutes- and was NICE. They giggled!

Right now I'm here at Mel's and it's only 8:30pm.... Juan gets off at 12 tonight (Since DQ closes at 11 during the summer). Sigh. I'm just waiting for my honey to go home.

At my last doctor's appointment which was on July 19th, I had lost 7.1 pounds and my blood pressure was like 30 points below normal. (But since mine is usually 104 and it was 94, it was only 10 points below normal for me). But we'll see how the next appointment goes. The appointment that will be on August 16 is when they're going to start checking for dilation, even though he's due on September 16. Spiffy.

Things are shaping up little by little, you may cause me to fall but ALWAYS I will come back up.

THE BABY GOOSE weighed 3 lbs, 4 oz. on my last doctor's appointment (which was 2 weeks ago). I still have not thought of a name.

Me and Juan quit Chick-Fil-A. They hired Brent back. So now we have no income, and we have applied at just about everywhere.

If you think im sexy and you want my body, come on baby let me know! WHOO Rod Stewart!

I'm not allowed to talk to Chris or David (or any other guy, for that matter) because Juan is jealous of guys. I feel bad because they were once my best friends. He doesn't even really like me talking to Dacey.

BUT I'm fed up with it. And I will talk to her! RAWWR.

He just now (as in he JUST called me this second) got a job at DQ. At least it's something!

"event","So I left Juan today... for good. I can't live in fear, and crying myself to sleep every night on the bathroom floor or in some other room or my car like I've been doing. I won't go into details, because the pain is still fresh and burning, but it HURTS. This is it... the end.

My baby {no longer ours} is now 6.5 months. He's a kicker. I was thinking about naming him Tommy. But since the baby will now have my last name, I like Adan. Adan Purcell. But I still have awhile to think about all that. But he's gonna have it all- the WHOLE world. My little sunshine growing in me is NEVER going to know the pain of not being loved. 

Aunie had her baby, a little girl. She says it's the hardest thing in the world to go through.

Felix... I'm sorry. You left me empty for a long, long time. I thought I found somebody to replace you, but no one will ever take your spot. You let be me be. I still think about you, wonder how you're doing. But I know you would never speak to me again. For awhile, that left me happy. But I still have all the pictures up, the journal we had, the little notes you wrote me, the silly little things you made for me in sculpture. I treasure those more than you know.

As for Juan, I can't get over him, and I promised I'd never give up, but I won't live in fear. And besides, I told him I'd do anything for him, and he asked me to leave. What more could I do? I quit Chick-Fil-A today, cause there's no way I could work with him.

Anyways, my cell number is 683-2089, my mom's number is still the same. FeFe, you can call anytime.

I'm a fat goose now. I feel so damn ugly and fat, and I'm not even huge yet. I love being pregnant with my baby, but I don't like how self-conscious it makes me feel.

I'm so lonely. I want to escape from it all... but there's no one there to comfort me. All I can do is sit and cry for everything that was supposed to be, but will never happen.

Think of me when this you see... FATA<MUDVAYNE<BJORK<JACKOFFJILL<KORN<AFI<SUBLIME<MOMO-Y-FEFE

Why must I think of you? It was supposed to be over so long ago. I always wonder how things would have turned out.

You, my phantom, will always be inside my mind."

I'm excited and happy, but it makes me feel funny. Sick all the time and my breasts are hard (wtf?) and they hurt. Like I ran into Juan's back yesterday and he was all SHIT you don't have to ram your shoulder into me. And I was practically keeled over in pain cause it was my boob and so painful.

Oh yea.. I don't know who commented on my last post, but um okay. So apparently you didn't affect my life too much :) (Unless you were someone who a long time ago, I loved mored than anything. But that person hurt me. So I'm happy now, and LOVING it.)

Me and Juan told Baby J last night that he's gonna have a new little brother or sister and he said I was gonna spit it out, and we said yes but only after it grows and I get bigger. He laughed and ran off. I love how little kids are completely oblivious to things.

I love going HOME with the man I love every night, and then making love all night. And having a little boy waiting to come tell me hi and race me up the stairs and to tuck him in. And then take him in the morning to his Amaa's. 

If only there was a song to describe it. I shall write one,... later. I'll post it up sometime.

Anyhow, I have to go and get ready for work. I just want to go to sleep cause I don't feel too hot right now, but we need the money. Desperately. Kids cost a bundle!

Next time anyone posts a comment, leave your name so that way I can know who you are. Don't be a pussy :)

At first they hurt [the pencil, so speaking] when they start to peel away, leave it raw and with a new ""skin"" but eventually are put in the trash [thrown away], and forgotten about. All until you sharpen the pencil again. And the memory remains...

Now for an actual update in my daily routine of stuff. I got my tongue pierced November 28. I have two tickets for speeding [one for 75 in the 50 zone, another for 92 in a 60 zone]. I have 2 court dates next week. That really sucks. Me and Smell are going to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra on the 12th. The same day that I have my 2-week checkup for my tongue, and the same day as the Christmas Office Party for Chick-Fil-A. So much to do, only one day!

As for Juan [my boyfriend. I have decided to take the ""current"" part out as I normally put, because I really care for him and would prefer to remain with him, rather than just have a week thing. I'm talking LONG-term relationship here baby!] I am madly in love. I hate how possessive he is of me, and how jealous he gets over my best friend of 3.5 years and my baby sister, and were he anybody else I would NOT put up with it. But since the day I met him there was just something about him that made him stand ""out from the crowd"" and now we're together. I got the boy :)

My nose is silly. Just like the rest of me. I'm goosified. Just like Smelly. WE ARE WE ARE THE GEESE OF THE NATION.

Juan doesn't have much to say on the phone. Travicito growls often at himself in the mirror.

Oh, so me and Melanie went to North Star Mall today. We went into Agaci and saw this guy that was in tennis with us last year, David was in there looking at stuff and I started cracking up and he came over and we said hi to him and asked him what he was doing there and he was all ""Uhh I'm here with my sister, she's shopping."" And then he like RAN out of the store and way out into the mall. OMG IT WAS SO FUCKING FUNNY.

Anyways, more later!

Jon is a lazy piece of shit, and I wish to say nothing more about him, other than what a great way to repay somebody. Jerk.

Things are shibby with me and Ray. I love him, and although he does not return the same feelings, he still cares for me. We went to Nightmare on Grayson last night with Mel, Naomi, and Cliff. Lots o' fun. Then Ray spent the night. It was hella good. *wink*

Since I've been all mellowed out for the past couple weeks, I've found that life is easier. I can't get worked up about stuff that I normally would.

For instance, yesterday morning I got my bag of clothes and blanket and pillows and told Ray bye. He was like okay? And I kissed him on the forehead and walked out. He just locked the door behind me. {Thanks for acting like you cared.} Then I wrote a note and left it on his truck. It said ""Thank you for letting me stay with you and taking me to get my social security card. I get the feeling you don't really want me around, so I'm leaving. I don't know where I'm going, but you know where I work if you want to see me."" Guess we'll see if he shows up. I highly doubt he will. He seems to miss Karen {his ex}. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been calling her up right?

It would have made me feel better if he would have at least asked WHY I was leaving. Leaving a note, psssh. Makes it seem even more pathetic.

The point to telling you that, though, is normally I would have stormed in and demanded to know why I wouldn't be the first girl he wanted to hang out with, considering I'm his girlfriend and all. All I can do is say that really blows, and be a little upset at the fact that I thought he was so much more than he really is. But I'm not fuming and yelling at him. 

Wow, the ways I have changed.

In just a few minutes when I'm done with this post, I'm gonna go deposit bout $50 in the bank, and call apartments to see who has a 1 bedroom and/or efficiency available. Then I will have a place I know I can go to every night without having to worry about being kicked out.

I went to Bill Miller's and saw Fletcher. He gave me an application, and put a word in with the manager. I might get hired there for days. Imagine, $7 an hour! That's awesome. Even if I only had 20 hours a week, I'd still make $560 a month. Plus keeping the job at IHOP, and I'll be good to go for rent, car, {getting a cell phone}, and {if I'm pregnant}. I miss B days in Web Mastering when we used to flirt/talk and go to retarded websites with Daniel. {RADIOHEAD.COM!} LOL. Such sweet guys.

I hate the way IHOP coffee smells. Especially their decaf. It smells burnt for some reason. And I HATE ALMOST EMPTY KETCHUP BOTTLES. I AM GOING TO FUCKING MURDER SOMEONE THE NEXT TIME I PICK UP A KETCHUP BOTTLE AND IT'S 3/4 EMPTY. FUCKING SHITHEADS, YOU ALL DESERVE TO DIE.

Sorry.

Football game between Lee and Holmes was alright for the first half. Got to see Jeanne perform. She stumbled once. She's so cute :P Saw Fletcher there. Umm... we critiqued the band and colorguard. It's great having a nerdling to do things like that with. Sometimes Melanie just thinks I'm weirder than I really am.

We decided that we are weirder than 99.99% of the world. If you were one of us, you would understand. But you're not, cause only Me and Melanie are ourselves, so therefore we come to the conclusion that you are nowhere near even comprhending what the fuck I am talking about. Good for you.

Not looking for a miracle,
Just a reason to believe.

I wake up every morning feeling sick. Swallowed my fucking puke today so that Ray wouldn't know I was sick once again. He keeps asking Jenny if I'm pregnant. Fuck man, I wonder if I'm pregnant! The last person I fucked {or did ANYTHING with} was David though, so um that would be weird if I was.

My head hurts from the tiredness.

I left Ray's this morning, at about 5 am. I grabbed my stuff, peed, kissed him on the forehead and said ""Bye."" He sat there and was like okay??? So I walked out the door. He just came and locked it behind me. Shows how much he cares, huh?

I really like him.

Too bad he calls his ex up and asks her to go do shit with him. I'm his girlfriend, shouldn't I have been the girl he wants to go do things with?

Whatever.

I won't pretend I don't care, because I do. And it hurts. But right now I still have bigger issues on my mind. Like WHY is my body having like every single sign of pregnancy? It's really freaking me out.

I got my license bout 3 days ago. I love it. I got 21 of the 24 questions on the written part right, completely failed parallel parking, and passed the rest of right. Piece of cake. I worried for 3 years for THAT? It was nothing lol.

Hey, it's been awhile. Sorry. Umm I've been working every day except Monday. I called in sick yesterday {I DID feel sick, but the main reason was that I didn't have a ride}.

I've been feeling so dizzy and confused {about what, I have NO idea} for like the past week, week and a half. I don't know what's wrong with me. And I have like 15 unexplainable bruises. Wtf? Leukemia?

I'm happy for Ray. He finally got a 3-bedroom with Cliff and Austin. It's nice! I stayed there for a few nights. When he took me and Jenny to HEB, we saw his ex there. He flipped out. Then when he got his stuff from her place and talked to her on the phone, she told him that she ""wanted to talk to him."" I hope he doesn't want her back? I really care about him. I feel akward {sp.?} around him now, and I don't know why. Oh well.

I decided not to move in with Jenny. I don't want to be around that shit, and I don't want my sister around it. Everyone was also saying that she's gonna get fired. I didn't want to be stuck paying 700/month, plus utilities and groceries by myself. Nooooo way.

Mama won't let me stay with her anymore, so I'm pretty much homeless just staying with whoever will take me in at the moment.

I have about $700 {a little more than that} saved up, and I really want to go get a bank account. Guess I'll have to save that for the day when I can also go get my social security card {and hopefully a driver's license.} I REALLY need my car heh.

I had a nightmare last night. I think it involved Ray and my mom {not together}. Don't really remember it.

Oh, here's some pretty baby names, was looking at them earlier after I looked up the signs of leukemia.

Adan Keeley {Irish- warm & handsome}
Autumn Lynn
Ziviela Marie
Todd Hoyt {English- fox, Irish- spirit}

Aren't they beautiful?

I feel SO FREAKING BAD RIGHT NOW AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S WRONIG WITH ME. My period is late... that was just old blood I had before. Scared me cause that was the first time it ever happened to me lol. But 3 different girls told me it was normal and that they've had it before, so I guess it's okay.

I've felt like just sitting down and crying my heart out, and if you know me, you know that's WAY not normal. Something's got to be desperately wrong. So what is the culprit of this feeling? Argggghhhhh.! Motherfucker!

Umm okay, enough ranting and raving. Maybe a new post soon!

For as much as I love autumn,
I'm giving myself to ashes.

"event","**Everytime you saw you're lonely, you just look a lot like me.**

I don't want a relationship. Here's why.

Luis (9th)- When I was 14, he was 17. He lived in Corpus, so it was a long distance relationship. I had total trust for him, because he was the first guy I ever loved, and had never been hurt before. I loved him so much. We broke up because he started talking about this girl.. forgot her name.. Joanna or something like that I think. I was paranoid.

Alex (10th)- When I was 15, he was 18. I fell in love with him. Thought the feeling was mutual. Lost my virginity to him. Was on and off relationship for a year and a half. He told me that he was just using me for sex. He cheated on me more than 10 times. Left 3 different times to go get married to different girls, I always took him back. He made me and Aunie go to this YEC {Youth Evangilistic Concert} because he needed us to find God. Well I didn't find God, and he found his soulmate, whom he preceded to leave me for, impregnated her, then left her.

Brent (summer after 11th)- Short, but sweet. He was one day younger than me. He was the guy version of me practically. I loved him with everything I had. I always wondered if I would have been happier had I chosen him instead of Felix.

Felix (12th)- My best friend, my lover, my soulmate, my world, my everything. I loved him. He ignored me for the first month we were together, which was why I got attached to Brent. But I chose Felix even after he ...... molested I guess is the word.... me. I moved in with him the day before my 17th birthday because my mom kicked me out. I never had sex with him. We did everything else though. We were plannin on getting married, had everything talked through. Were even talkin bout having a baby. God we were so happy together. Downtown was ""our"" spot, and we had our music that we listened to. From Autumn To Ashes, Bjork, Portishead, Finch, Sparta {whom I HATE}, Mudvayne, Dashboard Confessional, etc. I can't stop listening to all that now. Well anyways, I guess we split our ways when I moved out. Then one Tuesday morning when my grandma was at work, he came over as usual so I could give him a ride to school, and he raped me. My best friend, future husband, person that knew more about me than anyone {cept the little goose} else, RAPED ME. How could the one person I trusted more than anyone else hurt me so bad?

Those were the 4 loves of my life. And this is the version edited to make them sound a lot nicer and better than they actually were.

Ray.... don't love him and never have, but I was really happy with him. The only time he makes me mad is around his friends. He was the nicest boyfriend I ever had. I had really wanted to stay with him.

Okay, now what this all boils down to. I don't want a relationship, but should one come up, I want it to last. I've dated every guy in the phone book, loved 4 of them, been raped by one, and molested by 2.

I'm tired of guys frankly, and the next relationship I have, I want it to be someone I love, and for it to last longer than a year. Marry the fucker.

Yea I know boohoo all this self-pity, you're not the only one who's been hurt. But when you ARE hurting, you do feel like no one can understand EXACTLY your situation.

Anyways, I hvae to go get ready for work. 3-10 tonight. Ray might stop by and see me. I have to go to Jenny's afterwards, find out what's up with the lease and act silly with Mel afterwards.

Until then,

Content. What a beautiful word that is.

Jon came over yesterday. I didn't go meet him at the bus stop cause like my ENTIRE body is sore.... wtf? IHOP makes you sore? Anyways, so he walked from the bus stop to my house. I forced him to watch Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Awesome movie, and he liked it. It's funny :D

We cuddled all day. Wow he's comfortable. God I'm starving. Oh, my mom got me Wendy's and Jon ate some nuggets and jr. bacon cheeseburger COLD. Yuck. I'm eating McDonald's right now. Yum, haven't had their breakfast but twice before in my life.

I usually say what's on my mind upfront. Very blunt as well. But I am still hurting over Felix, and therefore scared about any relationships. I'm still not quite too sure how I let myself get attached to Ray.

I want to lay down and go back to sleep for a few more hours, but it doesn't look like that will be happening, cause I'm reading a book right now, and knowing how nerdy I am {you do, gosling}, I will probably finish the damn 416 page thing today.

I wish Jon lived closer. If he got a job on Wurzbach, he could live with me and Jenny {whom there's never a dull moment around}, and that would solve the problem of him living closer, and the problem of finding a third roommate.

I'm telling Anthony {x_nowimnothing_x} to send flowers to this girl he's talking to. He was like that's a GREAT idea.... but I don't know if she's a flower girl or not. DO IT. Hahahaha.. um okay sorry. He's funny.

Gee golly, far out, spiffy, groovy. That's white folks way of talking according to my Mexican manager. LOL.

I don't feel like typing anymore, got a book staring me down, just WAITING for me to pick it up. I think I shall succumb to it's almighty powers.

Oh Jon, do things that you would normally do. It pisses me off when people aren't themselves, regardless of whether or not it would you piss you off. And anything of **importance** you can ask me in person.

M'kay let's see....... where did I leave off? Huh, okay.

Ray's back in San Antonio. I went house-shopping with him and Cliff for fucking 16 hours. IHOP called and wanted me to go in early, but I said I had to finish looking at houses. I did end up going in 2 hours early though. I was SO FUCKING HAPPY AND ECSTATIC AND THRILLED that he was back.... I had missed him soooooooooo much!! We had a wonderful night of hanging out and then talking to this one girl who has obviously got problems lol. Well anyways, everytime he tried to kiss me or whatever I always gave him the cheek. I don't know why. And the occasional times I kised him, I kissed his cheek or shoulder. Wtf? Well then when we got Cliff, he started acting like a MAJOR ASSHOLE. Cliff is fucking funny and he can be a jerk about stuff, but I mean Ray is just an ASSHOLE around him. I definitaly did NOT want to live with him if he was gonna be like that. I liked him better when it was just me and him. Oh well, so much for ""a good book is always read twice"" huh?

Damn that sucks. I had missed him so much :(

I stole the car on 2 different nights for work. YAY go me! Twas much fun, driving illegally in my own car heh.

It's 5:01am right now. I wonder if me, Jon, Mel, and Mike are supposed to go on that double date tonight? I work from 3pm-10pm tonight, so I COULD go like right after that. Even if I do smell like IHOP. I like Jon. He's funny. But why would he fall for me? And so quickly? Oh, the boggling questions life contains.

As for the housing situation, I am FOR SURE moving in with Jenny. She's one of my co-workers, she's 19, lives 1 block away from the IHOP {3 away from HEB}, and about 10 mins away from Smelly Melly. It's perfect. AND I get my own room and bathroom. YAY. We just need to find one more roommate. Hmm.... who's got a job, has $300 up front, and has their own means of transportation to and from work, and is looking for a home?!

Here's my work schedule for the week:

Sunday:     3pm-10pm
Monday:     OFF!!!!!
Tuesday:    3pm-10pm
Wednesday:  3pm-10pm
Thursday:   3pm-10pm
Friday:     10pm-4am
Saturday:   10pm-5am

I started my rag at work. Fucking shit man, fucking shit. But it was alright, cause Leslie called her little sister and had her bring me a tampon {LOL}.

My legs feel.... like they ran for 24/7 for like a month. The exhaustion of it all! But I have $400+ saved up. And I don't even have my paycheck from IHOP yet heh.

Mel went shopping at North Star with Naomi today, and she got me this REALLY gay shirt that she says reminds her of me, and that she's been threatening to get me forever. I like it :D The gosling also got me an elephant keychain <3 and a star anklet. That silly fucking goose knows exactly what I like. Thank you little smelly hermana :)

""I'm not the goose that's so far away, when I feel the sillyness enter my veins. Always did I want to goosify again, and I don't remember when I wasn't a goose.""

Just peachy,

FUNNY MOMENT: There's these baskets with paper liners that we put in them for things such as dinner rolls & corncakes. We are SUPPOSED to heat the bread items up on a plate then put it into the basket. Well I was heating them up in the basket all day. But the last time I did it, I {was going to let it} cook for 10 seconds longer than I had been. The shit CAUGHT ON FIRE!!! I was like OH MY GOD THE FOOD IS IN DA FIRE! Caught everyone's attention. Very humiliating, but a good laugh. Only I could catch someone's food on fire after 13 seconds, right? :D

Hey I know you're reading this, so what does ""I've been giving alot of thought about Maureen"" mean?! HUH!? {Feel special fuckface/my bitch, you got the longest paragraph in my post!}

Okay, I need to go make the cake and pee. Err... not at the same time.... nevermind.

Jon came over for 3 hours and 15 minutes. He is rather extraordinary. I'm sure Mike will shit a brick soon as he finds out. ""YOU SEDUCED ANOTHER ONE OF MY FRIENDS."" Not quite, shithead. We hung out and NOTHING happened, cause I'm sure you wonder. I can't wait till I have a day off when we can hang out longer.

Though he should have kissed me....... ;)  {Don't flip out Mike.}

Anyways, we watched... err talked through... Ice Age and Finding Nemo. We had some rather intense conversations. Like about fish, and ribcages.

I like having a bitch. This rocks! Except you owe me, you fuckface. Losing sleep, walking through mighty beasts of branches. You should have given me a piggyback :P

Someone just used the word ""exquisite"" to describe me. I must admit it made me feel like some wonderful fabulous person or something. Vain I can be!

I'm horny. {Don't get disgusted Mel. You shouldn't be reading my journal anyways.}

M'kay, must sleep now. Work tonight 10-6!

I get nervous when she's near 
is it something in the atmosphere or is it
just her confidence that leaves me so defenseless
I don't know what to say when she's around she steals the air
from me and it is difficult to breathe she makes me lose my senses

She walks into the room immediately 
I am doomed I have no defense
the Blue Planet's archeress her arrow pierced my chest 
and I've been her slave ever since

She could be the one for me I get so weak around her,
I know that we were meant to be
I can't believe I found her.

When I saw her in the hall I stared too much and hit the wall
She must think I'm a stupid guy cause I get so distracted.
There's something in the way she sees the humor in my stupidity.
If you met her you'd know why I'm helplessly attracted

Soooo, I had work last night from 10pm-6am. Was not busy at ALL, and I'm cross-training to be a cook and cashier as well as a server. Ruben's a LOT cooler when Chelle isn't around... and she's leaving after Thursday with Jennifer (whos swing shift I will now get, yay!) And some ""mysterious person"" who we don't know of yet. Fred (who was the head cook when I left, quit) so now Michael is the head ..... and only... cook for graveyard.

Well... I need to iron my clothes for tonight, brush my teeth and clean my face, and then wake baby goose (yes, the smell IS my sister... Melanie is her name, btw) for school, and so she can tell me how her second day was!

I went with her yesterday morning and saw Fletcher {note to self- write his number down where I won't lose it} who is now a senior. Aww he's so OLD now :P And I saw a few other people too.... including Leah {GOD I HATE THAT FUCKING BITCH}. She was Felix's ""best friend"" but how come she was allowed to go to his house when we were dating and I wasn't?

Anywho... my legs hurt from standing for so long heh. I don't think I'll be going with Smelly to school today. Although the walking could probably do me good..... I've walked 4 miles in the past 2 days.

Oooooh, at work, Lee Ann and Michael were talking about spit/swallow and Michael asked me which one I do..... and I was like why does it really matter? Not like you'll ever find out from experience. And he was like oh let me guess, depends on how much you love the guy and how long you'd been with them yada yada yada..... and so I said let's put it this way... I would have done anything for my ex. He laughed at me.

Anyyyyyyyyyyways, it's off the internet I go! I have a working life now heh. Feel free to visit anytime... believe me we could use the business. {Wurzbach and i-10}

I'm starving! :( And it's all Jon's fault. Fuckhead.

""FUCKING GOOSE EGG"" That was a note Melanie wrote to me yesterday when she was mad at me. I love our fights, they are so meaningless and I don't think bout maybe 2 of them have any point whatsoever. I liked it when Melanie complained about how Mama has to touch EVERY SINGLE french fry before she grabs one. Then Mama was like..... you didn't even order fries, they're mine. ""So?"" Me and Chris had a good laugh at that one :D

"event","Hey! Mama, me, Mel, and Chris left to my dad's house today at about 8:25am. I was soooo tired but we had a very interesting conversation on the way down there about a million different things. So we were able to get my dresser, my clothes, and like 2/3 of the boxes that I had. Next trip I guess I will get the bed, the bookshelf, and boxes.

Then we decided to go to Port A for a little while, since it was still relatively early. But Mama, Mel, and Chris were hungry so we stopped at Whataburger first. Will works there and I was all OOOOOOOH I WONDER IF WILL IS WORKING? Cause that woulda TOTALLY rocked. Even though there's only one thing he wants, he woulda never even try for it since I'm so emotionally fucked. Yay! :) But anyways as we were ordering, he was being SUCH a dork and like ""We're experiencing technical difficulties, I can't take your order. Give me a minute."" I told everyone it was Will, but they didn't believe me. That is, until we pulled up to the window and I nearly shit my pants cause it was him!! I was all WILLLLLLLLLLLLLL and he was like HEY!!! I showed him my mohawk {which wasn't even up all the way, unfortunately} and he was like, ""That's it?"" IT IS TALLER GOD DAMMIT. BUT I NEED GEL BEFORE I CAN GET IT TO STAY UP TO ITS ACTUAL 3-4 INCHES! Then we continued on to Port A... on the ferry I SAW A DOLPHIN FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER! :) OMG it was amazing!

I went boogie boarding, because I've been wanting to for awhile. The waves ROCKED! Although I only had like 3 REALLY FANTASTIC rides, the others were alright. And I had one wipeout, which was a first for me. I felt like a jackass heh. It was QUITE the amount of fun. And none of the others would swim with me... no change of clothes. But this was the first time that I EVER went into the ocean where I wasn't scared! And without ANYONE!

Then we came back home. Read a little more of the book, had some more random conversations with Chris, and slept for about 30-45 minutes. Listening to him talk while I was in and outta sleep was really comforting. I wanted the ride to last just so I could listen to his voice. :D

OOOOOOOOOH we saw a dumpster in Port A {not next to the beach} that said ""NO FISH! Break down boxes."" I don't know WHY exactly that was so funny, but I cracked up. Guess you had to be there.

Once we got back up here, we decided to just drop by the apartments I was supposed to be moving into. Well, they weren't home. And Matt didn't answer his cell phone the past 3 times I called. I think that says something like GIVE UP. But I shall try until Ray gets back, which is Weds or Thurs. I CAN'T WAIT!!!! I FINALLY GET TO SEE HIM AFTER SOOOOOO LONG! I don't count the one time when he came to visit me since he moved away, since he was on some fucking drug that made him act like he was 4. :| I wonder if we'll still *click*?

Chris hung out here for awhile, but I fell asleep for about 3 hours, during apparently which he went home. My arm hurts sooooooooooooo bad right now!

Yeah, now apparently I can't post the little perks in my day such as my random convos with Jon cause Mike acts like a little kid about shit. I told Mama, Chris, and Mel how he reacted to the whole joke about his socks thing, and we all laughed over what an immature little baby he is. And Mama said that she does NOT want Mike dating Mel. Cause he's like every other guy on the planet {besides my Chris of course} and just wants sex. LOOOOOSSSSERRRRRRRRR.

But anyways. I actually really look forward to when me and Jon can talk. I don't care if everyone thinks he's spoiled and stopped maturing at the age his parents divorced, he's still nice to me even with all the shit talking going on in this little fucking soap opera. I should really give it a name. Any ideas? It doesn't hurt that he's hilarious. Oh, but hey Mike and Mel... I <i>don't</i> like Jon as more than a friend. And I've only met the guy ONCE in person. You dumb fucks! Plus he has a someone special :)

Well I'm starving, haven't eaten allllllllll day long. Must go find something to fill my fat belly! :P

Lataz Hataz,
*MO*

FUNNY MOMENT: Chris was begging to hear my old man laugh, but I was like nahhhhhh that's okay, I can only do it in front of Mel and Abraham. So he started doing it anyways. Then Mama came back to the car and heard Chris hacking up a storm and was like ""WHAT IS HE DOING?! IS HE OKAY?!?!"" when he was just imitating an old man. Hilarious, that look on her face. The laugh was pretty fucking good two. I give it 4.4 of 5 stars for the ability to make you laugh. :D"

I didn't get to talk to Jon for too long today. Mike wouldn't bring him home. RAWWR! Jon is my entertainment!

Gone...
We keep writing, talking and planning, but everything's changing. 
We all know what to do but know one does it. 
Now this time has passed and full of regret.
Two in my heart have left me a while, I stand alone.
When they get back, it won't be the same.
My life, you've always been there. 
Now you're gone and my heads spinning. 
Left the childhood, left the memories, left the good times in the past. 
Moving on your time has run out.
Wishing the clock would stand still, the world can wait. 
Wasting away once again, once lived as friends.

As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life.
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night.

Never will I forget you, and all the memories past. 
So rarely I get to see your face. 
Growing I looked to you in guidance.
We knew that time would kill us, but you're still so close to me.

To me you were my life. 
To me you were my soul companion. 
Now you are so far away. 
Nothing can take away the time and the memories we had.
Come back - to the days when we were young
Come back - to the days when nothing mattered.

I really have nothing of interest to say in this post, but I felt like putting down that A7X song, and that convo with Jon cracked me up. Cause Mike doesn't shower for a long time. Anywho, I gotta go. Someone needs me!

"event","Okay, so I may be a ""loser"" who posts all my shit up here, but hey it feels good to rant and rave. But let me say something. And that is that YOUR friend Jon asked me to do it. And David may I add, that you had to ask someone else for the link to my journal cause I never gave it to you. Good to know you go through so much trouble for me! :)

As for Mike... here was his response.
""ur sisters alot better then u and u know it thats why u treat her like shit besides ill date who i want and so will she in anycase be careful what u wish for cuz it might come true maybe someone will do the world a favor and end ur life as for em im through doing favors for an uptight cunt who doesnt appreciate shit and wants to play little mind games i cant wait unitl ur older in some alley sellin urself for some quick cash""
Who said I was wishing for anything? It was just a question I was pondering over earlier. And you play mind games too, you dumb hypocritial shithead.

^^These guys must love me a lot if they take the time to find the link to my journal, and then post in it! I am SO special hahahahahhah

Anywho, Thomas called me earlier. Not too sure why. He thought I was mad at him and that's why he didn't call earlier. I was, but I had a reason. But I think the only life-long grudges I will hold will be against 1.)my mom, 2.)my dad 3.)alex, cause of the shit that went on.

Chris has the interview for CD Exchange on Tuesday. I have to call him on Monday night to remind him cause he's a dork and forgets shit like that :D He's gonna help me move tomorrow I think.

Melanie is an immature little lying back-stabbing cunt. I will fuck up even more of her shit. She will not use me anymore.

Thanks David, I appreciate your input on my life, although I could care less what you think.

Anywho, I slept all day, and I woke up when Robert called to tell me that he wasn't doing his little BBQ/Fire thing, but just grilling some burgers. I thought he was my brother so I was like wtf? He sounds JUST like him on the phone when I'm tired. That amused me. But I didn't go.

I made another From Autumn to Ashes CD today, cause I had a couple more songs I wanted to put on it. Someday I will be able to afford the ACTUAL FATA CD's!

Mike {18, bout to be 19} wants to date my 16 year old sister! Can he not get any good looking girls his OWN age? Fucking loser. He has no right to make fun of Jon for dating younger girls when he wants a girl who recently turned 16.

Here's an all-time favorite quote of mine.
""We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing one another.""

Do you ever feel like you're just wishing your life away? Look back and wonder where you'd be today if you'd done that ONE thing differently?

"event","God I'm so depressed. I just went through my photo album of about 250-300 photos. Of my entire life from Kindergarden-12th grade. And guess who takes up quite a portion of that? Felix. As much as that guy hurt me, and what he robbed me of, whenever I look back at pictures I can remember EVERY little detail about the day that they were taken. Most of the ones I have are from when we were so happy together. He was my entire world, the love of my life. How can so many things go wrong and your entire life {or what it seems} come crashing down all at once?

I've been listening to From Autumn To Ashes and A7X and Thrice tonight. FATA reminds me sooooooooo much of Felix, cause he's the one that made me listen to them in the first place. And all the sorrow, the pain, in their songs..... is how I feel about Felix. The smallest things bring me the greatest amount of pain.

Fuck. My arm/shoulder/collarbone still hurts. I'm so frustrated with the pain that I am going to throw a FIT! X( rawwr!

For you losers who dont know who From Autumn To Ashes is, seriously download ""Chloroform Perfume"", ""Mercury Rising"", ""Short Stories with Tragic Endings"", ""Autumn's Monologue"", ""The Fiction We Live"" just to start with. The songs are so beautiful, so melancholy, so sad and 'ironic' in a way...

It's 8:17am and I need to go to sleep if I'm gonna go to Robert's BBQ/Fire thing later.

I talked to Ray. Why doesn't he seem the same? He's still... himself. Just not the Ray I first got to know. He comes back on Wednesday night or Thursday morning depending on when he gets the check cashed. I can't wait to see him!

""Confined in me was your heart. I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me.""

""It's not that I dont love you anymore, but it would be much more accurate to say that I never loved you in the first place.""

""You might be just what I need..... I break in two over you.....""

""Nothing hurts my world, just affects the ones around me.""

""I wish I could be the one,
the one who wont care at all.""

"event","Wow! I was supposed to go to Ingleside today to get my stuff, but Berta didn't have the other $20 he needed to get here and back, plus he had to work a graveyard shift tonight. So Robert offered to take me down there in his uncle's truck, but neither of us can drive stick shift, and then his uncle ended up needing it.

But that was okay, because I forgot I had an interview at Jim's tonight at 6pm. So Robert {being the sweetheart he is} came and picked me up and took me there. He had a coke while I was interviewed. It went okay and all, and Artie {the manager} said to come back when I knew exactly what days and hours I would be working at IHOP so that I could work around that. Then Robert wanted to go eat at Dairy Queen, so I told him to turn left out of Jim's driveway..... very bad idea. SO much traffic! He pulled out when like 2 lanes of traffic stopped for him, and the guy in the middle lane was waving him on, but then a car came from nowhere from the right side..... so Robert slammed on his brakes and the van hit us. The van walked away with a bent fender. But Robert's STEEL firebird is umm...... bad. Not in good shape. To get home, Robert's dad had to drive me home in HIS car. It's okay though, cause his dad's hilarious. But my collarbone and left arm are hurting REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY fucking bad. ARGH. And the whole accident was MY FAULT because I told him to turn left! Oh I feel so dumb sometimes!

Other than that.... not too much happened really. Mike and David are assholes, so that's no news. Melanie fucking lied to me twice, so that bitch has some revenge coming her way. Immature I know, but fuck man she does a lot of shit to me that I just sit there and take, and I'm tired of her using me. So from now on I just simply won't let her!

It's only 2am, so I have 5 more hours I need to stay up so that way I can sleep during the day. Merh.

Till there is more fascinating subjects for me to delve into.

*MO*

FUNNY MOMENT: When Robert ordered a coke at Jim's, he expected it to be brought out in a glass. But NO, those cheapskates, served it in a PLASTIC cup. And it was $2!! So I was all JACK IT! and Robert demonstrated by taking the cup, shoving it into his shirt, then jumping THROUGH the glass window all crazy style, running to his car and speeding away into the sunset! No not really, but he said he'd do that. What the fuck? Sillyness! :P

We.... understand each other better now I guess. No more secrets. She also told me she would never talk to David again. :)

I called IHOP last night to ask if I could go back and work there. I called and when my old manager (Ruben) answered, and I told him who it was, he was was all HEEYYYYY GIRL! WHAT'S UP? HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? WHEN CAN YOU COME WORK FOR ME? like practically before I had a chance to ask. It was funny, and I said Monday, but Chelle is managing that night so he said come in Tuesday at 10pm. Graveyard again :D

Robert brought me and Mel Jack-In-The-Crack last night. What a sweetheart :) He hung out with us for a few hours, and we all watched Blind Date and Elimidate together. It was hilarious, especially the old people who were catfighting.

Berta is gonna come pick me up in the morning at like 8am, and help me move all my stuff up here. Aunie might be coming with him, cause she wants to see me or hang out with me or something like that. Mel is gonna go with me too.

Matt {who's apartment I'm supposed to be moving into} didn't answer his cell phone when I called a little while ago. He better not be backing out, cause I'm fucked if I can't live there.

Mike and David came by a little while ago cause Mike wanted to show me how his car sounds.... something with the exhaust, I don't know. It sounds like an angry bumblebee. I like it! He should be fucking it at the moment, esp. since it has TWO holes. Pervert :P

James {DiscipleOfHomer} is coming over right now, should be here any minute. An old silly friend of SillyGoose. And I have to call Robert at 12am so he can ""kidnap me and show me a couple of movies."" He's an odd one....

So today has been weird. I stayed up all night, then I was gonna stay up all day too, hang out with Brent (who never called or showed up), then go swimming with Mike and Mel. Mike came over at about 7:30 or so {skipper} and crashed out here and Mel woke up and we talked for a little bit, and threw cups, a soda can, markers, and pillows at each other as hard as possible. Then we got the markers and started marking on this sticker for the navy or some shit like that that's on the door to our bedroom. We were yelling how the other was gonna die {LOL you simply would not understand!}

SILLY GOOSE FOREVER! S&G's4:20, Hi Melanie you hidious smell a goose egg :P {See so now my journal is cool, cause you're in it bitch!}

Then at about 12:30pm I decided to take an hour nap, ended up sleeping for a little under 2 hours cause Mike came in and I have NO idea what we talked about, but I remember I was drooling. WTF? That's gross lol. But then he left, and I got up for awhile and then went back to sleep cause I was so hungry I was feeling like I was gonna puke.

I still feel realllllllllly sick from not eating. But why would anyone in their normal mind eat shit like canned tomatoes, cream of mysteriousness with mushroom sauce, moldy stuff that I THINK is bread, and expired milk? Raunchy!

Me and Ray got into a HUGE fight last night, and then I don't know, it's okay now. So that's good. Cause I like that boy. 24 going on 14..... :D

But other than that, my day has been slow. I have to pee really bad right now, so I shall go take care of that.

Until I feel the need to talk to myself again,

FUNNY MOMENT: 
Mel- ""You will die an old lady!"" 
Mo-  ""Uh... thanks!""
Mel- ""Oh, I meant a young lady! Like 20!""

Mo-  ""You will die with someone else's kids""
Mel- ""You will die with your OWN kids that are 100% Brazilian!""

Mo: have you ever found yourself in the most beautiful/romantic setting ever, that you were just awestruck?
Jon: yes
Jon: with jackie, all the time
Jon: i took her out driving and we had out own private spot down in a gully
Jon: we watched the moon when it was full
Jon: it was so pretty
Jon: fireflies everywhere
Jon: the air was cool
Jon: it was perfect
Jon: and then one time we made love in our spot
Jon: it was great
Mo: ....the only time i have ever seen something so wonderful, was when ray and and i went to mcallister park.... we spent hours there one evening, and shortly after the sun had set and we were lost on some trail, we found this one beautiful spot where there were MILLIONS of fireflies. it was the most romantic thing in the entire world
Mo: it was more than awesome
Mo: it was.......
Mo: beauty in its purest form
Jon: sounds like mine and jackies spot.
Mo: normally i dont get all emotional over stuff, but that made me long for so much more than i have
Mo: it actually made me want to stop playing the game, and just be with a nice guy for awhile, and forgive my mom for everything wrong she's ever done to me, and be a nicer person in general, and not take things for granted ever again. it's like i had a revelation to true happiness there.
Mo: *ahem*
Mo: too personal there
Mo: anyways
Jon: why dont you just stop playing the game and find somebody anyways...all your doing is hurting yourself.
Mo: no im not
Jon: keeping yourself from happiness is weird
Mo: lol
Mo: i am weird
Mo: but im content
Jon: O.o
Mo: i am
Jon: new post up, its boring.
Mo: i like my life. i do hold many a grudge, and hate quite a few people, admire a few others, and long for a second chance at certain things, but everything and everyone who comes in your life happens for a reason. how could i not be content?
Mo: okay
Mo: if you think about it, we're LIVING..... thats really amazing if you think about it. we have hands to touch, and places in between our fingers for someone else's hand to fit into whether it be your best friend, your bf/gf, or even your mom's when your a little kid and think the world is perfect
Jon: great way to view life.....8(
Jon: but, i have noone to share that all with.
Mo: we have eyes to see everything beautiful on the planet.... things so intricate, it is a wonder they exist. and ears to hear sounds you might find so melancholy it makes you sad to know that so many people are not happy, so it makes you strive even harder to find meaning of your life. which it may not even exist. you may just be merely here, not for a reason.
Mo: but that's whats so great.... because it doesnt matter.

So, Ray's throwing a hissy fit because he got the cold shoulder and his friend made a move on that girl. I told him that I was going to move in with Matt and Paul. I don't think that helped the situation any. He's threatening to go get in a fight or something... I really wish he wouldn't. He's also saying how he's not gonna be a nice guy anymore because he just gets used. I liked him because he was genuinely nice, and funny with a quick wit/sense of humour. The only reason I broke up with him was because he moved to Laredo and I don't like long-distance relationships. *Sigh* And I did (and still do) care about him... I would've even gotten serious with him. I miss our ritual of e-mailing each other like 2-3 times a day as well. Oh well, the past is gone.

So Mike and I continue to play the game... {my dear, gay friend. LOL im just playing with ya}

Jon's birthday is today, and he threw a fit because Mike told me about his past. {When he's just lookin out for me.} Immaturity seems to be taking ahold of everyone today. But whatever, it's cool.

If Brent doesn't come hang out with me today, then me, Mel, Mike, and his cousin Eric are going to go swimming. I desperately need to shave my legs. Today is day 12 of holding it off, so it's about that time.

I just fixed the vent in our room. No wonder it was so fucking hott, the vent was like practically closed and even when you opened it, it was shaped retardedly and was still messed up. So go me, I fixed it :)

I haven't listened to my Finch CD in awhile, I wish it was here instead of at Daddy's right now. For all my little miss independent nature and ""I don't need anybody, I'm fine on my own,"" sometimes I wish someone would care. Like REALLY care, not just every now and then.

MAJOR BCI!!!! AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

Well, this little fit of ranting has helped me none with the things I'm actually thinking about. So I'm not quite too sure what the point of this post is. But that's okay, cause I'm still a silly goose.

Melanie and Travis look the same when they sleep. They're both passed out on the bed, with their backs to each other so it looks like they fell asleep mad at each other. That's hilarious. I wish the camera's batteries weren't dead.

So here goes....

My friend Brent (N-ton) came over today for about an hour and a half or so. It was soooo cool seeing him, but sort awkward. I mean, he knew from the beginning that Felix was going to hurt me. So he was right, and I should have gotten with him back when I had the chance. But everything happens for a reason, so I'm pretty sure I'll be okay. He's changed a lot. His hair is cut short, he doesn't have his KoRn hat anymore (which sucks), and he's gotten more muscular or something. We're supposed to hang out tomorrow if he gets his license renewed early enough in the day so we'll see how that goes.

Melanie and I made hot dogs a little while ago. Mine got cold as I was creating this account. I hope you're happy Jon.

I called Matt, and I'm going to be moving in with him and Paul this weekend. So now I REALLY need to get a job.

I decided that I like Avril Lavigne's song ""My Happy Ending"" cause it reminds me of Felix. Pathetic, I know. Especially since I hate her, but that's okay.

Mike hung up on me today when I called him. That's okay, cause I'm a mega-bitch to him even though he does the nicest things for me (btw, thank you again for taking me to Diversions!)

I do believe I have covered my day now. So, peace out.

Oh yea... today before Brent got here, I was dancing around to ""Accidentally In Love"" by the Counting Crows, and I slid across the wood floor in socks, and I fell on my ass. THAT was hilarious. :D

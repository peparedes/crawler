"event","Yeah!!!!  Things finally returned to being as normal as possible.  Car works again.  Hearing is only as crappy as it used to be.  I have an interview for a job tomorrow.  Things are looking slightly in the upward direction.  No I st hope I can actually get this job I have an interview for.  Otherwise, I'll be going into week three of unemployment.  Fuck that!  I need some money so I can afford things like food, gas, something to distract me from my family, etc.  So everybody wish me good luck, 'cause I really need this job.

  Words of Wisdom: Like candy, don't take advice from strangers.  They don't know you, so can't adequately aid you.  Not to mention you never know which ones are the crazies.

Things that piss me off:
  It pisses me off that every dumbass I know has a job and I can't get one unless I go back to fast food.  I walked into an electronics store the other day and asked a guy where to find a movie and he pointed in the direction of CDs instead of the big fucking section of movies which we were both standing right next to!!!  I wanted him to show me where in the movie section it was.  The guy was already in the right section of the store and he pointed me elsewhere for Christ's sakes.  How do these people hold a fucking job?  I could have closed my eyes, bashed my head into a wall, taken hallucinagenics and still have done a better job of directing a customer to a movie.  Or how about these stupid people who sell the cigarettes at Wal-Mart?  These fucking assholes cn't even listen.  I go to buy cigarettes for somebody and I say 'GPC'.  ""Did you say 'GPT'?""  No.  And this mistake is understandable.  Here's where it gets a little stupid:  ""Okay, so you need 'GPC's'.  I'll get those.""  Then she holds up some fucking 'USA Gold' shit and actually thinks she's found the right shit!

  These aren't the only things that make me wonder why I can't have one of these people's jobs.  How about al the lazy shits I see working everywhere.  These assholes just want to get paid for breathing.  Here's a guy who wants a job and wants to actually work (that's me) and I can't get hired.  Of course, these people can't tell how much I work or how hard I work just by looking at an application.  On the other hand, if they checked the fucking references they ask for, they'd know.  Does anybody know why employers ask for past work experience whe they never ever check a reference.  Never!  You waste time filling this shit out o fifteen different applicationsfor absolutely no reason.  That should piss everbody off!"

"event","That is exactly what my life has been like this week.  Nothing terrible has happened, but I keep seeming to yo yo back in forth.  First of al, I got most of my hearing back, but I can still pressure in my ears which means the infection isn't gone yet.  Also, I was having a good week in school.  Then I find out on Wednesday that a paper I thought was due in mid February was actually due in two days from Wednesday, or today for those of you who prefer things simplified (it seems as if nobody likes being confused anymore).  Then, on Wednesday, my car dies on the way home. I had to pay $65 for the tow and then another $230 for a new alternator.  Not a bad price, but goddammit I'm a little poor right now.  Tehn, I find out I get car back on Thursday when I dropped it off.  That's very good news because me losing my car puts five people's schedules at risk, not just mine.  Tehn, after I get that slice of good news, I find out that after today I am unemployed.  I saw it coming because the job was seasonal, but I was still holding out a wee bit of hope that Waldens would keep me around.  So, let the penny-pinching and job hunting begin!!!

  I swear to god all I need is to find twenty dolars and then find out I owe two hundred.  That wuld seriously just top off this annoying week.  I think I might have to choke a bitch if this wacky shit keeps up.

  Words of Wisdom: Always make sure your couch is a comfortable one.  That way you piss off your significant other you don't have to be uncomfortable on top of getting bitched at and kicked out of your own bed.

  Things that piss me off:
   Here's a little thing that pisses me off.  Why do you keep your car running while you pump your gas?  They have signs just for these dumbasses saying ""Not a good idea retard!' and they still do it.  They're not even in their car to benefit from it running to kep warm or whatever.  Besides, if the heater is running, the car won't et tht cold in the little time it takes to pump and pay, especially most people pay at the pump to avoid human interaction anyway.  'But my kids might get cold and they want to listen to the radio.'  Buy your kid  fucking coat and make them realize that the radio will only be off for a few minutes and they can fucking deal because we do not need to raising any more whining pussies.  WE HVE ENOUGH AS IT IS!!!!!

  Now some might be wonderign why this pisses me off so much.  Let's see, we're leaving an internal COMBUSTION engine running while pumping FLAMMABLE gasoline into the car.  Wow, that a conundrum.  And I wouldn't mind if it was just that person who was going to get blown up.  But if their car goes up,the gas station goes too.  Tehn the other motorists get torched, the poor guy working there, and some other people nearby who may get hit by flaming shrapnel.  Not to mention you're taking out one more gas station meaning supply decreases while demand remains relatively the same.  This means we may see a little bit more of raise in prices.  THANKS ASSHOLE!!!  These kinds of retards piss me off because they don't fucking think because I don't think they can.  Especially if they can't read a fucking sign to begin with."

"event","For all who have nothing better to do than read this:  Today I have truly mediocre news for all of you.

    MY FUCKING COMPUTER FINALLY WORKS AGAIN!!!!!

   That's right, so expect to be bored and annoyed much more often now that I don't have to rely on a slow-ass piece of shit at home.  I now have my third testicle back in fully working order (is it sad that I love my laptop that much?).  Other than that, I have no new news.  I have a paper due in two days and I've not started on it yet.  Good thing English is what I do, or I'd be worried as shit.  Otherwise, I have naught to report, but I already said that.

   Words of Wisdom:  The world is full of perverts.  Get into the porn industry and you could not only be rich, but a household name.

   Things that piss me off:
     Here's something that really pisses me off.  Why in the name of Christ's holy sphincter do people have to put their heads up their asses every time they leave their house.  Elaboration: People can't drive worth a shit.  Seriously people, why can't you just drive as if you have a working brain.  I'm saying this about the slow people or the careful people who piss me off; I'm saying this to the assholes who can't pay attention enough not to change lanes at the most inopportune moment or try to make it across six lanes of highway about thirty seconds after the light changed. Also, people who can't seem to walk around a mall in a manner conducive to problem free transit.  I get ten minutes to cross the mall, get a drink, and take a piss.  Problem, I have about eighty complete fucking assholes in front of me who can't figure out which way to turn.  'Which way is 'The Gap'?'  Why don't you go find a fucking direcotry and quit turning and then correcting while trying to decide!!!  And you know, these people can't be completely retarded, otherwise they'd have to live with an aid or something just so they wouldn't burst into flames or drink the Drain-O.  Is the air that bad that when a person leaves their home, they become instantly stupid?  And if so, why not everybody?  Maybe as I was a sstuid as these assholes I wouldn't get pissed off.  Of course, if I was any dumber I might actually kill myself or others instead almost doing it by accident."

"event","So I'm having fun with being medicated.  After being the day's medical curiosity for my doctor on Tuesday I finally got the drugs I was hoping for.  The problem, now I'm always hungry or tired.  Although I did get some extra hearing back in my left ear.  Unfortunately, the right one is still mostly not working (not to mention ringing for about the fourth day straight).  Is it said that the most important thing I have to talk about is a medical issue?  Sweet mother of fuck I have absolutely no personal life whatso-fucking-ever.  I need new topics for discussion.  I think the problem I've become so apathetic about most of the things around me that I'm no longer angry enough to bitch on the internet like I used to.  I've actually not cared enough to become complacent.


   SWEET FUCKING CHRIST ON A STICK I'M ACTUALLY MILDLY COMPLACENT!!!! 

   Ladies and gentlemen something has happened.  Those of you who now me well may be a little frightened, but we may have narrowed Chris' conversational topics down to perversion, profuse swearing, and offensive topics.
   Wait, who are we fucking kidding.  Somebody will piss me off eventually.  I can't go too long without that anger flaring up.  Hey, maybe I'll try adding 'the things that piss me off' segment here.  This must be really boring for others to read.

   Words of Wisdom:
      Children are the future.  So can we please get a head start on killing all the stupid people we already have to cleanse the gene pool for future generations?  Otherwise we're gonna have a world fifty percent okay and fifty percent with their heads up their collective asses (or each others depending on exactly how stupid they come out)."

"event","So I'm at my predominately Christian school and in the middle of campus I start saying 'fuck' very loudly and proceed to give my sister and her friends the finger.  The problem with this is that I'm sure I offended more than a few people and I really didn't give a good god damn at all.  That strikes me as being a little bit rude.  I mean, I'm purposefully swearing around people who I know may take offense to it.  But on the other hand, I really have trouble caring about a bunch of people I don't even know, and refuse to change my vocabulary for anybody.  So, I guess people will have to keep on being offended by me.  So, I'm officially an ass.  Congratulations to me!!!  I can finally admit that I am not a nice person at all.

  In other news, I just found out that I was very close to having both my eardrums burst.  Thank the sweet and fluffy lord I chose today to go to the doctor and get all my wonderful drugs.  The down side is that I had to pay the price of a small island to get all drugs in order to avoid paying the price for a large island to get surgery.  Isn't just full of near misses and shallow victories.

   Words of Wisdom:
     Life is full of near misses and shallow victories.  Celebrate every small win you can get.  Otherwise, you'll always be morose and nobody wants to be around a morose person (which means you'll never ever get laid you sad sack of shit)."

Anyway, I have nothing much to say.  My life has been boring of late aside from working and douchbags pissing me off.

So now I'm back on here and don't really know why I'm bothering to type out this shit, but I'm bored hanging out Stephen, so here I am again.  Wow I just said a lot of nothing while simultaneously (did I spell that right?) using several words.  I have nothing much to say hence all the text with very little content.  Life just doesn't hold any surprises for me as it does for other people.  I hear stories of people and their antics (what a great word) and I just don't have any antics of my own.  Maybe I should just make some up.  Eh, I'm not willing to put forth that much effort.  Fuck it (you all knew i couldn't go for a whole conversation without saying fuck).

Marilyn is back (Yay!!!) and my family is leaving me alone.  All of my papers are done and I am finally sleeping well again (first time since about two years ago).  Although the extra sleep has made me a bit lethargic in the morning (morese than usual at least).  Now I know this wonderful beginning will probably even out (or even crap out) by Wednesday, but I'm optimistic (not a common occurance for me) about the days ahead.  Anyway, thought it would be nice to post something positive instead of negative this time.

"event","This week has officially began to suck major ass!!!  Last week was great.  Work was easy, got my paper done, got my software.  Great fucking week!!!  This week I showed up late to work on Sunday (I had to open the store that day), found out my software was a it of a let-down, Marilyn (Stephen knows who this is) went on vacation and left Bev (no replacement for Marilyn) to work her hours, and my whole family's bitching at me 24/7.  Not to mention I got a speeding ticket for $150 the other day.  Some days I wonder if the trade off is really that much of a deterrent from mass homicide.  I find myself seriously contemplating accepting the anal sex in exchange for killing everybody who pisses me off.  However, thanks to my desire to keep my virgin ass just as such, all the bastards I have to deal with remain safe and out of harm's way.  But still, I'm thinking about it!!!

"event","i had no idea that this wuld happen

im just upset because you're one of the many many reasons why i pretty much hate myself...and i hate myself for letting you let me hate myself czu the words to sayd to me were always just that..words..people say actions are louder than words..i didnt see much action either..so maybe we need to turn up the volume cuz i cant hear anything...and i always thought that as we grew older we'd have a better realtionship..i mean..maybe we arent there yet..but i hope that we dont grow apart and never speak again..o god i wuld hate that so fuckin much..i jsut feel like shit for always tryin to be a part of ur life becasue i tried by doing all the wrong things..and im so sorry...


for 16 years i thought that this day wuld be better than the day i got married..and now im not sure if i want it to come at all...cuz im mad we never got closer..and im mad we fought all the time..and i kno that you know who you are by now..and i kno that when we get old we'll have each other..but will you want me?? and if you wont..ill have nothing left while youre off having ur own life..i jsut hope that in that life you remember once or twice along the way..and it never hurts to jsut pick up the phone and call..at least to say hi how ya doin'? cuz either way ill always care for you..no matter what you say bout or to me..you will alyways have a big piece of my heart..bucz the heart never forgets..evn if the mind does...

i dont wanna let you go from my life..evn tho you have dirfted so far already....at least youre hanging on by a thread of hope..


wow..never ever thought id have feeling liek these..im so fuckin confused and all i want is...i dont evn know anymore...


it has always felt like you are on the other side of the world...evn when i stand right next to you...










thanks alyssa....youve been my everything for a long time now...i just didnt relaize it.."

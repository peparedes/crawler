my heart bled i swear...

"event","so on saturday we went to monte carlo and somebody got lucky...!!!!!!!! i came with 100 euros and left with 388 euros. it was awesome.

i started spending my money immediately on sunday for a spectacular lunch at a restaurant in st jean cap ferrat on a cliff overlooking the ocean. breathtaking views, sunshine, and one of those meals i'll never forget.

and then on monday i bought myself a new purse at longchamp. it's very classy, beige leather. hurray :) thank you monte carlo.

i also spend many euros sending a huge heavy bag home... but it would have been just as expensive with the airlines. they get more and more strict everyday it seems.  and then i don't have to worry about it and lug it around with my other big and small ones...

cool.

and i got an email from my marketing professor with a job lead! i have no idea where or what, but i emailed the guy and we'll see. in any case it's a great sign that my professor from Haas was willing to refer me to someone. that totally made my day.

today i was up very early for my bike ride and i'm already at the library. got here around 10:40... that means i will get the whole afternoon free! i might take the train somewhere along the coast... maybe cannes, lori said i should go to st paul de vince or vence...

just got the professor's OK to be my referee (a referee gives a reference) so that's great. still waiting for the 3 others.

depending on the WCO client's answer, i will have either a site with photos of her module or a version without them. i hope she says ok. Olivier my boss said OK but i decided it best to ask her also.  arg. waiting patiently is challenging...

i'm going to Big Game this year and very excited. i think it will be a big reunion for me. i'll see lots of people i haven't seen in ages and we'll have lots of fun beating Stanford (sorry dad and jo).

"event","and i'm advancing every day. it's pretty awesome. i can't wait till my portfolio website is done.

still using the connection at the library, and it's working just fine. 

spent all day sunday  in cannes. it was a hot day, we even went swimming! very good times. and had yummy fish and french fries and apple tarte tatin at the beach. and then laid out until the wind got too cold and we all went home. i left my youth discount card for the train at home! lucky me didn't get checked on the train ride home from cannes to nice. pierre picked me up outside the station and all was well. it was right in the pocket of my wallet where i left it. safe and sound.

and i wear sunscreen EVERY DAY!!! so i have a slight tan but i can say that i'm taking very good care of myself here. even my legs aren't so ghostly white. how awesome.

if pierre's meeting comes up soon enough, i'll be going with him to paris for a weekend. maybe next week. but it's so lovely in the south. it's 24-25 degrees in the daytime and maybe 15-18 at night. can't get much better than that. i hear paris has gotten cold and yucky. no thanks. but a weekend could be nice. we'll see.

the meeting is to sign a contract for a website his company is selling to a woman who wants to create an online furniture store called Chateau Shop. it might hit the US one day if she does well. she's spending money on all the right things to compete with the biggies. i hope pierre signs. he's the salesman and would get the commission. pierre's uncle's friend is the woman's lawyer, that's the connection. and so the uncle and his friend the lawyer are down here for the weekend. that was nice of daniel to give pierre more time with the lawyer friend. i hope it works out.

"event","actually right now i'm in Cannes; pierre is with his cousin steve measuring the inside of a restaurant he just bought. it's on the boardwalk next to some big hotel. sounds like a good location. hope it works since Steve has done zero of the preliminary research/market studies i learned about in my marketing class.

the apartment is nice and modest, on a very steep hill 5 mins away from a pebbly beach. it's quite beautiful and i love the ocean air. i'm on vacation!!! hurray

getting out of my apartment in paris and getting here with my 60 kilos of luggage was hellish (132 pounds.. all my stuff plus stuff like towels and sheets and pillows and medecine) but with patience and lost money i made it just fine.

i got a very well priced ticket on easyjet and then bought myself the right to 2 extra suitcases. i showed the contract to pierre's mom who said i'd be able to have 60 kilos instead of just 20 (so 20 per suitcase, that's 44 lbs).

so i finally get there with my 132 lbs of luggage (hell) and discover that buying the right to extra suitcases meant literally that. ie no extra kilos, just the damn suitcase, ie i can have one suitcase with 10 kilos and 2 others with 5 kilos. i couldn't believe how ripped off i got. and then they said that to buy the extra KILOS not just a stupid extra suitcase, it would be 15 euros per kilo over the original 20 allowed. ie 600 euros. so i took the bus to the air france terminal (many nice people dragged my luggage into the bus.. i also had my computer back-pack) and the woman there was SO nice, she gave me a youth discount, got my roundtrip ticket for 107 euros, and the extra kilos were only 1.50 euros, instead of 15. wow. so i happily paid my 170 euros, waited 5 mins in lines instead of 20 at easyjet, sat at the window with no one else in my entire row, fell asleep, and woke up to see the shining mediterranean sea. it was awesome. and then i found the apartment. the taxi driver was a very nice jewish guy who wished me a shanah tovah (he said his son was moving to israel and he wasn't arab, so i put two and two together) and then i waited outide the apt building for an hour while pierre finished his very important finance class. and then at 6pm i was finally done travelling and my boy took care of suitcases (there's an elevator).

hurray!

and i'm getting a bike and i'll enjoy the beautiful bike path along the Baie des Anges (the bay of all of Nice, old and new neighborhoods.... very long nice path). i plan to enjoy that in hte mornings when pierre goes to school. and then find cafes and teach myself to make a website. exciting!!!"

"event","was awesome.
the best crepes were in ploemeur, a little town in the middle of NOWHERE. i liked La Baule, a beach town full of parisians on vacation, and we stayed two nights in Guerande. we had a beautiful bed and breakfast with a lovely woman named France. it was some old 300 yr old building or 400 i can't remember, an old stone building. and she decorated it so beautifully.

see all my pics from brittany:

http://community.webshots.com/album/553293828msNnoB

of what's not included in these photos (because that took forever), we went to larmor plage (that was a sleepy day because in the morning i was feeling quite allergic and decided i had to take a pill i normally take at night. i was exhausted the entire day).

we went to the forest of paimpont/broceliande where they have legends about king arthur. and we found a random lake and walked around the lake. it was so lovely. there was this huge abbey overlooking the lake that had been converted into the city hall of the little village.

i loved perros guirrec. beautiful scenery. i was much more impressed with natural scenery than by the silly towns in the north, dinan dinard and st malo. we didn't even go to one of them, the one right across from st malo. i wanted to get to mont st michel. all we did in st malo was eat. it was yummy.

all those apple crepes with vanilla icecream were quite good. but the one in ploemeur at le petit breton i think it was called was the best of all. apples cooked with honey on the inside and caramelized apples on top with homemade whipped cream and shaved almonds and vanilla ice cream. one of the best desserts i've ever had. i remember my main course being delish as well. we were quite impressed!

we had a great dinner in rennes on aug 11 at Le Galopin on the main road leading to the train station, boulevard de janvier. i had lobster and crab ravioli! yummmm. and then i stole pierre's chocolate lava cake cuz the weird brittany specialty i ordered was gross. it was a great meal and the wine was perfect. ok now i have to remember what it was called... something with a C, pere et fils. that's not so helpful. but it was so good. i suppose i could call the restaurant and ask them. anyways, it was yummy. white (because i had the fish).

this week alice zhang from berkeley is in town with her friend jordan. we've been eating out and they've been going all over the place without me during the day. now alice and maybe jordan but i'm not sure are coming over for dinner. i need to get over to monoprix asap and get creme fraiche to make salmon pasta. and mushrooms would be good too.... mmmmm"

"event","so my new intern finally arrived yesterday. she seems bright and cheerful. that's always good. we'll see how things go next week for intensive training. this is a great experience for me.

it was a calm day at work. i picked up a little work on yet another project with a big client in Toronto, CIFFA (canadian international freight forwarding association). olivier signed another contract with them a couple days ago and has since been in a good mood. although he completely blew up at the intern who works on quality standards for the company for being innovative basically. all the other top people liked what she did but he blew up and made her cry :( animedia is unfortunately not a real company by US standards bc they are so lacking in the HR department. and olivier also seems to be assuming i'm staying after september 29. as we get closer to sept 10 (my last day to decide whether i stay or not) i will remind him that i haven't budged on salary terms.

i'm getting very excited for calling hp. i wonder if i could actually get a new client for the firm... that would be pretty awesome. in a huge way.

the brilliant idea: from the brilliant jo:
and then i need to download the course content for that cs class and get up to speed on javascript and cs design, etc. http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/answer.py?answer=23690

that's what i want. jo's idea is that i should use my experience at animedia more directly, and that going on transferable skills won't get me very far. she's right... all i have to do is learn enough javascript and cs jargon to get through the interviews. the rest i could learn on the job. but i need to learn about HCI, Human Computer Interaction, and UI, User Interface. HCI and UI jargon. javascript. for a google engineer salary and benefits and company culture, i think i can handle it. YES!!! bring it. :)

and today we're going to buy food and house supplies, and enjoy wonderful paris. i'm in sublime happiness. all is well. pierre and i are doing so well right now, and tomorrow we might run away to deauville tomorrow! ok pierre wants my attention right now. brb.

now he's on the phone with a classmate. they're waiting nervously for their grades to be emailed

so yea i really would like to go to deauville tomorrow. go north, get some cool ocean air... mmmmmmm"

"event","i'm taking it on thursday.. i'm very excited because i've been doing well on practice exams and i can't wait to get it over with.

so my last day at work earning my happy new salary (well i start next monday) is september 29th. then they say if i want to say i can for about half. HAHA. yea right. but i haven't said no yet, i'm keeping options open in case i want to stay and negotiate. highly doubtful but i have until september 10th to tell them what i plan to do. they can wait.

so learning from my mistakes in misjudging the many hours it takes to do my work, i gave olivier a more realistic estimate based on my experiences in the past month and he said wait that seems like too much bla bla. too bad. i'm not going to work overtime.  no no.

and of course france lost. the italians said something extremely nasty to france's star player and he turned around and rammed the guy with his head and knocked him over. i guess it's in the news. i conclude that the italian must have said something racist or something else offensive and foul, and zidane lost it, forgot that he was at the world cup, or else figured he didn't give a shit because he just retired as a billionaire and the rest of france gets to go to work the next day and the next.

my turn to win on thursday!! :)

and then no more intern pay!!! EVER!!!!! :) 

this weekend i want to work on my resume. i might as well do it in english and french. i'll start sending it around in the coming weeks.  my ticket home is now november 8th. either i find some incredible well-paying job in france and stay longer (1% chance), or i stay until nov 8th and do something in october (x% chance), or i decide to leave earlier (99-x% chance... yes i'm in GMAT mode).  pierre doesn't know if he'll get into the really good business school so that puts things in limbo.  his stupid school won't even give him a grade report for his application. the director said he should have written down his scores when they were posted. apparently it's a bad school. not surprised though; it's in a shitty neighborhood and 2 years old. if he doesn't get into the fancy mba-type school, then he'll register at a public university in bordeaux, lyons, or poitiers, depending on where his brother ends up. if pierre has to go to bordeaux in october, i dont think it would make sense for me to stay in france for more than a week after the end of work. i'd have to change my ticket yet again.

or, i go on vacation for 5 weeks and set up interviews from abroad for my return and try and get some more travelling in before i leave europe. but as pierre pointed out, it wouldn't be ideal to travel alone right before leaving pierre. i wouldn't be starting work and a new phase in life. i would just be missing him for no reason. i could go to bordeaux or wherever for a month and go on monster.com and craigslist and berkeley job websites every day and make phone calls in the late afternoon while he's at school. i could see a new city in france. then i'd have some breathing time and i wouldn't need to bother changing my ticket.

but especially if smadar is in israel, that could be a GREAT opportunity to go for awhile... but my baby....

ultimately, life is complicated, and my book is open."

pierre is being very cute.  we're about to go to myriam's house because i haven't seen her in forever. she moved to london and understands now that working at jp morgan isn't necessarily worth the money. i think she works 13 hours a day. that sucks.

i have been leaving the office by 6 recently since i've turned in a bunch of stuff and boy do i like that. i have my own intern!!! all MINE!!! it's so awesome. and he's a smart UCSD student, not like some people in the office who are lacking in the intelligence and common sense category.. but he's so young, only 18 years old. i told him that if he wants a day off to go see museums or do whatever he wants that he must. and his hours are 9:30 to 5, so i hope i'm being nice. i also gave him the most pleasant of my projects to work on, the drugs one. the modules on official documents and nomenclatures and such are so confusing and boring. i'm happy to have a helper get through this one quickly and cleanly. finally!

so that's really awesome.

and wow i am going to be with americans for 2 weeks straight. craziness.  the first week i'm staying at the best western in pewaukee (isn't that the most hilarious name ever... it's like the peewee version of milwaukee, i love it!). maybe i spelled it wrong but whatever.  the stupid travel agency was looking for hotels in the center of town whereas GE headquarters are in the suburbs. so glad i took charge and i found exactly what i wanted for half the allowed budget in a matter of 5 mins online. it only took about 1 second for google to find the address of GE's headquarters and then mapquest told me what hotels were nearby and that was the end of that.  hurray for me the smart person. silly frenchies.

i don't think they've reserved my flight yet. they're pretty last minute... but i do know i'm going for 2 weeks for sure, and i know what i'm going to be doing.  this is a huge project, and if it goes well, animedia will have many more. so i need to do a good job.

basically the Tip Simulator animation will replace GE's user manual for big scanner machines.  it's a brilliant idea. we just have to do a good job.  :)

and animedia's going to pay for all my food, and olivier said they would reimburse me for a sunday trip to epcot center! even though he knows the CFO will scream, he said i should enjoy my weekend.  boy was i smart to ask for a raise and demand some respect for the work i do. they're going to appreciate it.  i'm excited! but i need my throat thing to go away.  i will take lots of nasty medicine.  pierre showed me how to use the thing i spray down my throat. blech. (pierre is my angel.... even when i'm under the weather and come home after 5 hours with the client no lunch break and an hour and a half on the phone with another client.. still makes me smile :)

we had SUCH an awesome weekend in Deauville. we ate lots of fish and shrimpies and it was very delicious. i had chicken for the first time in awhile (deliciousness... it said in huge letters guaranteed from france etc). the food there was all local. i could tell by the quality of what we had.  i have never had such good shrimp before in my life.

but the bastards at the casino wouldn't let me in the room with all the tables without a passport.  so i won 13 euros and change on the slots (20 cents machines). not bad :)

the hotel rocked.  it was right behind the boardwalk in between andre citroen's house (citroen is a huge french car manufacturer) and the normandy barriere, the big hotel owned by the casino.  we had a balcony with a partial ocean view and a view of trouville, the town against the mountain next to deauville. it was so beautiful and the ocean air was delicious.

i like the ocean.

olivier-- oh but but but.... so now they want me to stay until i finish the next project coming up with GE. and apparently it's bigger than he thought, so i'm going to their headquarters in milwaukee instead of orlando. supposedly leaving may 15th

anyways if they want me to stay until mid october or late sept whatever, up until my student visa plus 90 days tourist visa expires, they're gonna have to pay up. i basically said they'll have to match or come close to what i'm worth in California. well, they're certainly getting paid US style by GE. they can afford it for sure. he said well i'm not going to completely alter my salary structure bla bla, i said of course and shut up and smiled. it worked so well. he said he'll see what he can do financially.  ha! and if it doesn't happen, i have 5 weeks of blissful vacation, i go home on the 24th as planned, i find a job, i get paid, life goes on as planned no problem. so really i have nothing to lose.  if i work, it means i have a little less vacation, but i get to stay a little longer with pierre and i get to go home with extra money. i wonder if he's serious or not about having me finish their project. also he said well it depends on what you want to do. well, i want to earn money doing something i'll enjoy and be good at.  i can do that in paris or in california. so yea i like my job but i won't do it for peanuts. don't like peanuts. so we'll see how close to 2,300 euros they can get. hmmmm i wonder what i'll take. i guess i have to decide before he gives me an offer what im willing to accept.

"event","wow. guess they've decided that our brand new mailboxes are sufficient. or perhaps the place that was taking our mail noticed that we never showed up in a month to get it so they sent it all over. perfect, so we'll pay our rent right on time. (it's due on the 5th of every month)

we just went to the gym and had dinner. good times all around. and i got through more of my permutations/combinations/probability book for the GMAT. they have several subject based books with gmat type examples.  i get confused on all of the formulas for permutations/combinations but now i have a much better grasp on the material. i know that when the order doesn't matter, that means that AB is the same as BA, for example, so that means there are fewer possibilities, so the denominator has to be bigger, so i need a k! and a (n-k)!. when the order does matter, like people in a row at a movie theater, then there are more possibilities so the denominator is smaller, so it's just (n-k)!.

there was one about there are 12 stores.  they are represented in supply chain management orders etc by colors.  there can be 1 or 2 colors to represent a store. order doesn't matter, ie red-blue is the same as blue-red. how many colors minimum necessary to represent 12 stores?  well the first time i made a formula i forgot about the 1 color possibility. realized i was wrong when i checked the answers (this is why i need to practice forever and ever) and then added the 1 color possibility and got it. 
[n!/(2!)(n-2)!] <b>+ n</b> = 12.  you get an unsolvable function of n equal to zero, and then you just change 12 to 13 to see if it works, it doesn't, 14 doesn't either, but 15 does.  n=-6 or n=5. n=5. bingo.  but i was very close on the first try, i just forgot about a detail in the question, which happens fairly frequently. i think that i should write down all of the main givens in a question every time i get a complicated one.  then i won't screw up.  arg!

i want a damn good score."

pierre fixed the phone bill business. so now we can make calls again. today i must study for the GMAT.  so of course i have begun by going online. 

yesterday we went to a party at a business school with bazillions of people and rooms with music and drinks and stuff. we = me, p, his brother arnaud, myriam, and a bunch of her friends.  the 3 of us left around 2:30 or 2:40 and walked home. boy did i wake up late this morning.... and of course we were the first to leave. i was bored.

pierre is off with family today. i decided to ditch that and stay home. i need to study and i really didn't feel like going and being social in french with his family for 5 hours. not so much. tired. i think i'm going to eat an orange. oranges are yummy. i need to wake up and work. maybe i'll go to the gym with pierre around 5 or 6 and then get dinner. that would be fun!

time to eat an orange. time to work.

and please call me!!!

"event","we went to chatellerault this weekend and did nothing. it was fabulous. (that's in the middle of nowhere at pierre's parents' house)

i did lots of practice problems for gmat studying and am doing well.  on saturday we went to see a car show... it was actually about 20 classic cars parked in a plaza in front of a 15th or 13th or whatever century church.  the cars were cool.  so was the building.  they were advertising the real thing with a race where you have to pay to get in, etc.  the free version was great.  we got coffee on the plaza with pierre's friend and all of his friends from that town (poitiers) and enjoyed the warm sun.

on sunday we went to visit his other friend who was camping out next to a lake and fishing (but no fish).  there was no flat space, all on a hilly bank barely wide enough for his tent.  my butt hurt at the end of that.  and there were bugs. i was careful to stay in the middle of the tablecloth i was sitting on. but it was beautiful.

and peaceful... and that's all. came back to paris, arrived in the train station at midnight and went home. i was tired this morning at work.  the usual... i like it, but i won't be doing instructional design after this. it's not exciting enough.  i think there's jobs that would make better use of my talents.

we just ate steak and zucchini and potatoes. it was yummy.
i'm exhausted....
and they still haven't told me when i'm going to orlando, which is a little annoying.

"event","no more matzah, damnit!! get us out of the desert! my tummy hurts!

well i think it also may have shrinked very slightly this week, which justifies all my efforts.  pierre and i were very good. we also didn't meat for a week, which i bet i've never done in my entire life since i graduated from baby food. interesting.  so the last meat i had was at eva's for 2nd night on thursday, a week ago. and in france, the sephardic jews have milk and no other dairy products.  so it's been fish, veggies, fruit, corn, potatoes, and matzah. oh yes. matzah matzah.  

i promised pierre that i would wait until dinner to eat bread with him.  i now know the sound of his scooter arriving in the street below. it doesn't sound like any of the others. i'm waiting for it.

a few weeks ago he was in chatellerault where his parents live and said he was coming home wednesday at 10am.  at 10pm on tuesday i heard that scooter, and beyond all logical reasoning jumped off the couch to look out the window, and there was my pierre.  ha!

where is he!! BREAD!

getting exploited by france telecom... then the assholes decided to cut off our line. oops.  guess pierre and i need to drag ourselves over there and explain that they charged us too much, send us a new bill, and then we'll get the phone line back.  but it seems to receive calls, just can't make them. cool.

but then we don't get mail, so that poses a problem as well. why is france retarded? this would never happen in the US. listen to this.  so our mailboxes downstairs in the courtyard were in horrible shape. our box didn't close, they were old and many people never got new labels and just taped over old ones (i wrote over a taped one... i.e. third user... kinda ghetto). so i figured that would never change. but who cares; i don't get my paychecks at home. and even if i did, no one would bother stealing them.

so they fixed them! brand new beautiful mailboxes.  i got my new keys on friday and happily waited to give the 2nd key to pierre on wednesday (but he arrived on tuesday).  but no. on tuesday, there was a big fat sign that said that our mailbox labels were defective (??), that they were deemed unsafe, and that we have to go to such and such address in some building 10 mins away to get our mail. and they're open m-f 9-4:30pm.  and have you forgotten that the bank is open 9-5 tuesday-saturday?  so you can never get mail, and you can only go to the bank on saturdays. better be in town, if not, wait a week!

silliness.  

where is pierre. i want bread! i want i want i want

and lori, you asked twice what i'm doing for my birthday, i have absolutely no idea... it's on a monday in may that already has 2 mondays off, so i doubt i'll be on vacation.  i shall probably be at work. i'll ask pierre to come and have lunch with and everyone else. and then maybe go out for dinner and jazz because i love live jazz. but i have no idea...

and for some odd reason, i already feel 23. i know i'm 22, but i feel 23. felt 23 for a bit.  maybe because pierre is 23 and i'm always with pierre and our birthdays are so close anyways.  (feb 18th).

i want BREAD!!!!"

-where are they produced
-economics and finance in drug trafficking
-main trade routes
-main methods of concealing drugs
-differentiate between different drugs
-understand production methods
-understand how to recognize effects

alright guys. if you've taken classes from david presti or something and have great online links, hand them over.
Although i've just done a bunch of research on government websites and have tons and tons of info. i finally get a fun topic! (did you know that around 2-3% of worldwide GDP is illegal money laundering from drug trafficking?? that's a lot of money... yikes)"

"event","so i'm finally going to one of the places that i somehow missed last year... we got a hotel and train for the 2 of us online for 2 nights on a holiday weekend. we decided to just take a morning train on saturday and skip the hotel fare for friday night. it's so close anyways by train... yay!

this week was annoying at work.  i worked on a search engine and given how much time has been lost fixing mistakes in previous modules, i decided to do it all myself instead of letting the guys in india do it and screw it up.  it's much harder to fix later... so it was just lots of numbers and lists of numbers and it was pretty boring. oh well.

passover as usual. lots of chanting in hebrew.  it was nice, although the sephardic charoset isn't nearly as good as ours, in my opinion.  i hope i can make to the fields' seder next year.

i've been thinking a lot about what on earth i'm going to do when i get back.  i decided to check out monster.com and craigslist for jobs--there's essentially nothing for people without experience.  there are more jobs on those websites for dropouts who spent 2 years working rather than staying in school. i'll have to contact berkeley's career center for help. and network. and pray.  and i looked at thunderbird business school (norah morley suggested checking it out), but applicants must have 2 years of work experience.  i'm going to have to find something good... i wonder how this will turn out.  it's so hard to get anywhere without the business experience or degree. where are we supposed to start????

thunderbird is a top international mba school... according to a wall street journal ranking by recruiters in 2005, it's number 1 for international business, miles ahead of insead, harvard, columbia, and wharton.

anyways, time to eat. i'm starving. if you have a job for me that's cool in september in california, i'm down."

"event","ann, jenna, (and some of jenna's friends) and i went to the exact same flamenco place that i went to last year with rebecca hawley. and the same woman was dancing, and she was wearing the same dress, and i loved just as much as last year.  except by the end i could barely breath anymore from the smoke. it was truly suffocating.

i got a tummy ache and missed the day trip to cordoba and a half day out in sevilla for the hotel room, but other than that i loved it.  i found the hostel i stayed at with rebecca in sevilla to reorient myself. that was a very exciting moment.  so sevilla is as beautiful as it was before, and it glows at night just like it did last year.  that made me happy..

oh and we ate delicious food all week (super yummy) and ann had grilled (or something...) calamari everyday :). and lots of food with ""no aciete"" sorry i can't speak or spell in spanish. that's hopefully ""no oil"" because they douse everything in oil.

the hotel in sevilla was fine but no one spoke english and that was problematic or just funny depending on the situation... so ann decided to get a suite for the 3 of us at le meridien in barcelona... what a room.  even my little pull out bed was so comfortable, nice pillows, down comforter, and we had a huge walk in closet and a large terrace, i loved opening the windows with the 3 layers of curtains, the weather was fabulous, it was so lovely.  and i fell in love with the sagrada familia, particularly the inside.  that's antoni gaudi's church in barcelona. i was very surprised at how much i ended up liking it.  open air, huge, tall pillars made to resemble trees in a tall forest, the architecture just worked.  i was very enamored and spent ten minutes just sitting on a bench inside staring at the ceiling and zoning out.  i bet i've mentioned staring at the ceiling or the sky several times in this blog... the simple pleasures in life... ah yes.  of course the complicated parts of life are better/more significant (like having a boyfriend who speaks a different language and lives on a different continent who i love very dearly), but i need a mix :)

and now winter is gone, and springtime is here! it's not so freezing anymore. it's raining a bit, but this is so much better than the bitter cold. pierre and i had coffee at place des vosges on sunday and walked around and took the scooter around paris for an errand--i had to pick up something at my old apartment on rue du dragon... it was a lovely sunday.

so i had a very nice break and now i'm back to work.  but i feel a little lost because without rachel, i have no direction really, i have no direct boss at all, and i don't want to do something wrong and get screwed later.  whenever the company director olivier decides to come to work, i'm going to meet with him to set up a schedule and to prioritize my projects, and i'd like to set up a (at least tentative) weekly 10 minute meeting to see what i'm doing for hte week and make sure all is well. i mean i'm essentially in the place of a project leader when i'm two steps below as an intern.  as silvia (the italian here) told me, it's good experience and i should definitely meet with olivier asap. i have learned here that they'd rather answer a million questions before seeing you screw up because you weren't sure.

can i nap?"

"event","on saturday i ran lots of exciting errands while pierre was with his parents.  i went to the bank and deposited my second paycheck (exciting), and then i took the bus down to a train station where i took my favorite metro line 14 to place de la madeleine.  i got another pair of work out pants for 7 euros and took the same metro to chatelet, the center of underground paris, switched to the RER (big trains that have fewer stops than the metro and go outside of paris) to go down to the luxembourg gardens (note that walking all over paris in this weather is impossible...).

then i walked a little through the beautiful gardens to the senate museum where i changed my reservation to see the phillips collection (yes, the one from DC is visiting paris) and got my tickets. hurray for getting tickets in advance and not waiting in line!! :)

by then sandrine, a very nice girl at work, called me for the 3rd time that day with her exact location for lunch. i met her, her sister, and 2 other girls from work for lunch at 2:30 or something at this spanish tapas place. when i got out of the metro i had to cross a big street to get to the restaurant, and a HUGE protest was about to start, and the people were just about to start marching. boy did i run to cross the street before they blocked it. good times, good times.  they were yelling about the government kicking them out of their delapidated and unsanitary apartment buildings, renovating the apartments, and then raising rent. welcome to france, everyone. so i ran across the street and had a nice lunch. oh and i picked up a brochure outside of le baiser sale on the way, a famous jazz club that as i just learned has performances nightly!! i'm very excited about that. oh and tomorrow night we're going to see live african jazz or something at cite de la musique, some big concert hall. i saw an ad in the metro and pierre called for tickets right then and there.

after lunch i went home and a very yummy dinner later that night with pierre at a creperie around the corner.  it was delicious...

and on sunday... paris was sunny and beastly cold. very tricky... nasty weather because you see the sun shining so brightly over the city and the waters of the seine, shining on the eiffel tower, and then you realize that your feet have never been so damn cold. oh adn pierre got his scooter back.. so he took me around and it was lovely--to the museum for the phillips collection, then past the eiffel tower, and back home along the seine. it was breathtaking. and at the end my feet were so cold i could barely walk. not kidding.

and sunday night miriam leuin came over for dinner and we had nice time catching up. and lots of yummy food.

oh yes, sunday morning we went to the farmer's market, the open market at place d'aligre 10 mins away from home. now i recognize the women who sell cheese, the butchers, the guys who sell fruit, the ones who think they're too cool to actually take your order and the ones (who i prefer) who are screaming ""one euro! one euro!"" and take your order right away. it's so fun! and the food is delicious. i got ""fromage blanc non lisse"" which looked like cottage cheese, so i thought i'd give it a whirl.

oh my god it was good. REAL cottage cheese. fresh, the kind of thing you need eat right away, not american knudsen stuff.  pierre and i ate the whole tub for lunch (it was small and i wasn't that hungry, but still, i had a lot...). also non fat free or anything... soooo delicious.

and lots of yumminess. and good times.

and this weather better get warmer... but it will be warmer in spain!!! although i think it'll be raining in the south... boooooo :("

just wait until maybe after 12 noon your time today to call.  if it still doens't work wait another day.
i signed up last night but it takes them awhile for the phone to actually work.  apparently a little elf has to come into the house and magically tap the phone for it to work and they're busy elves so it takes at least a day or a day and a half... who knows how things work in this country :)

generally speaking, best time to call is during your lunch hour. ie between dinner and bedtime for me. noon-1:30pm. or weekends... go to little cell phone stores to buy calling cards. you just call a local number and the card gives you access to making the international call. it's not expensive at all. you just spend $5 and then make calls and pay as if they were 310 or 510 or whatever. :)

it's time to eat... i am hungry.... :)"

"event","ps rebecca simon: cold weather + things to do + i'm lazy = i still don't have a home telephone. pierre and i need to go to France Telecom (the phone company) to get our line activated.  until then, i don't have a home phone... but if you want to call me i've posted my cell number.. it's 011-336-1791-0978

so yea.. we had a nice weekend... friday night was shabbat as usual.  we crashed early... pierre got curtains (ie fabric that he just put up and attached to what normally holds curtains) and red fabric to cover part of wall up near the ceiling that had moisture and cracked paint ugliness. so now that looks better. we basically red lining the top of the wall.  It matches our red circular rug... it's makeshift but perfect.  on the way home from shabbat we went to vivianne's (aunt's house, where we were staying before, across the street from the grandparents' apt where we ahd shabbat) and took her vacuum cleaner which she hasn't used in years.  we figure she won't notice it's missing.  i like vacuums.  so much easier than mopping... ew. anyways....

saturday morning i went to the bank because i don't have my ATM card yet.. pierre went to the market, and then we went to janet and armand's at noon for lunch and afternoon talking... i like going there but it somehow feels like an interview prep. very intense. gotta know what's going on in the news, be ready to go.  they're funny.  they invited another ""young man"" ""almost done with his studies"" (chin/nose up while speaking) ok you get the idea.  little cookies with coffee, all very pretty, plates with beautiful yummy light food like a restaurant, garden, living room to arrive in, dining room, and lower sitting room, etc etc.  i am apparently going to armand's gym next wednesday (beautiful.... it's closer to a country club) for some abs class, and then dinner and then he'll drive me home. 

at one point i was talking about job stuff and i said that i feel my technique didn't work last time, that going online and applying directly for jobs involves too much competition and too little chances of getting anywhere, that next time around i'm going to use connections to help me get my foot in the door.. brains alone aren't enough these days, especially with my literature degree (which i'm still proud of, but no one who's hiring seems to like it).  it's all about the people you know. of course if you're incapable of handling the job then you're screwed, but i'm assuming in my scheme that i can handle it.  anyways... so he then proceeded to tell us about how sam (his son) got his first job online, about all the hoops he jumped through and crazy interviews he did to be picked... 7 out of 1000 applicants were hired.  so yea.  EXHIBIT A 7/1000 ain't a whole lot.... yea.  welcome to haas on-campus-recruiting.

so yea.  it was fun. i think pierre got bored near the end but he insisted that he had a good time.  we left to walk to the train station with the other guy and finally relaxed and just chatted.  i invited him to our party this friday night. party! yay.

speaking of party... at 9pm we went to one of pierre's friend's bday party (she's 27) just a 10 min walk away.  we had lots of fun and i drank... 5 glasses of champagne? not too bad :)

and on sunday we ran lots of errands and then went to christian and martine's (where i stayed aug. 2004 pre-apartment homelessness) for their party... it was his 60th birthday (i got them a book with pictures of american national parks and descriptions... i think they liked it) and a going-away party for their daughter esther who is goign to germany (Jo- near Dusseldorf i think she said... slightly difficult to understand names of German places that i don't know well to begin with in a strong french accent) for 6 months.  she's in our equivalent of 10th grade. and martine is a great cook... yumminess.  mom i think you had her fruit cake with creamy deliciousness all over it... and chocolate cake and some alsacian pound cake and quiches and everything all home made. oy. but poor pierre got hammered for not knowing about a protest shooting at our metro station and martine made sure he knew the date and facts. i thought it was in 1968 but wasn't sure about how many people exactly were shot etc etc... i was excused for being american.  lots of silly dates.  and martine the teacher, oh yes we were in professor land :)

ok time to get back to work..."

"event","i'm going to brussels sometime in march for work! how exciting. it's so weird to think of the places i find myself in life. i just think, hmmmmm, i never would have imagined myself here 6 months ago. life is exciting.  rachel (the other american, she just turned 25 and also has a french bf) and i will be going to the World Customs Organization offices in brussels for 1 or 2 days. i'm hoping it's 2 days so we can stay overnight and see the town a bit; if not maybe we'll be lucky enough to get a monday or a friday so we can make a weekend or something out of it.  that would be awesome. i've only passed through belgium by train on my way to amsterdam... twice. :)  oh and speaking of which... laurent (pierre's cousin from berkeley), louise (his gf, goes to cal), pierre and i are all going to amsterdam around the first week of august for a few days. and then the 2nd week of august we're going to bretagne (brittany?) for a wedding--i've seen the couple several times, including last weekend for p's bday. they're friends who moved from brittany to chatellerault where p lives.  i can't remember what the guy does, but nadia designs wedding dresses, so she's getting one from a contact in paris. i'm sure it will be absolutely gorgeous.  oh my god what am i going to wear... crap. let's not thing about that.

but anyways... it's going to be unbelievable.... we're talking real people of the region for a really big deal sort of occasion... they're known for their food and alcohol.  they're serious drinkers... so hopefully people won't be passing out all over the place.  and when they drink, it's all very high quality... certainly not like american college students (:))

so that'll be fun. i love visiting people and seeing the real thing.  that's how i saw alsace last year... wonderful.

and... i don't think i've mentioned this for some odd reason, but ann, jenna and i are going to barcelona and the south of spain the 3rd week of march! i'm so excited.  i won't be wearing my coat for a whole week!!!  i've never been to barcelona, so that should be awesome.  and then i get to go back to sevilla and cordoba.  that'll be quite a treat. although it's funny that i'm actually back there... one of those places you expect to go only once, if you know what i mean.  not like paris or london, you know if you go once you'll likely go again. but those little places.  :) little pleasures are sometimes the best.  i wanna find the flamenco bar rebecca and i went to last year. that was awesome... i'll have to print out the pictures and show them to someone at the hotel or something so we can find it again. yay!!"

"event","yesterday was the marathon day of all days.... we woke up at 9am, out of the house around 10am, and we got to our apartment with a car full of groceries etc from Auchan at around 9:30pm.  we had mcdonalds for lunch because we were looking for ikea in the middle of nowhere, didn't find it at first, and didn't have much of a choice.  i didn't get my own fries and my tummy was still very unhappy.  mcdonalds is disgusting.... 

so then by 10 we'd finished unloading and i was in the apartment with pierre putting things away.  we hadn't eaten dinner and i was pretty tired and my stomach felt like it was going to destroy itself or something.  then BOOM i felt SO sick... oh my gosh it was horrible.  it was much like when i was traveling back from venice last year... hot flashes, nausea, it was fabulous.  poor pierre.  i wouldn't sit or stand or eat or not eat, it was awful.  he made me eat against my will and the quickest thing he could find that i didn't shake my head no to was some ravioli business.  i figured i didn't have much choice and gave in... 5 pieces of ravioli later that was it.  i finally fell asleep and the nightmare ended :) i love our apartment. it's perfect.  everything works, everything is clean and nice, we just have to move in and put together furniture from ikea etc.  pierre and his dad are picking up everything today that we picked out yesterday after we finally found the damn place.  it was basically next to the airport, very far away and HARD to find.  there are a couple exits with the exact same name... yea.  it was fun. and there were 5 of us in the car, me in the middle in the back, and realize that french 4 doors are much smaller than other cars... yikes.  we also spent well over an hour at auchan in the evening after signing papers and getting my luggage from miriam's place/my old apartment.  oy.  but we have LOTS of stuff.  :) it's so exciting!

oh and i'm feeling much better now... this morning i barely ate my cup of cereal but i didn't feel as sick and now i'm pretty much fine. pierre is off running errands again like crazy with his dad and he has school tomorrow. i might tell him to relax and we'll put together the furniture next week.  his dad has lent us his toolbox until the next time he drives up to paris, so there's not much of a rush. i think tonight we need to organize what we have, at least decide where all the furniture is going, and have a nice slow dinner :)  we have tons and tons of food-- steak, cheese, pasta, rice, green beans, corn, lentils and sausage, cold cuts, yogurt, and wine! :) 

okie... time to work. everyone's returning from lunch break.  and it's just about 2pm. time for air conditioners!"

"event","tomorrow we sign papers! and tomorrow i get keys to MY apartment!!!! i'm so excited.

pierre's parents will drive up from chatellerault (near tours, half way from paris to bordeaux) and then we have the apt inspection at 11am.  that'll take about an hour... and with pierre and his parents there, all i have to do is sit in the corner happily and stare at the walls of MY new apartment!!

then from 12 to 3 (or however long it takes) i will go to the bank and get a bank account (yay i cannot wait to function like a normal human being in the modern age and cash my first paycheck which i received an entire week ago...)

then at 3:30 we go to the agency in the 17th arrondissement (sort of nouveau riche neighborhood, nowhere near the apartment in the 11th) to sign papers and pay the agency lots of money. i cannot wait.  i want an apartment!

and then the funnest part of all: IKEA.  shopping!!!  :) i'm going to get a little hanger stand for my clothes and maybe some drawers, stuff for the bathroom, and anything else we decide we need.  i guess during the inspection i'll take charge of figuring out what's missing and what we want to buy.

and after ikea we go to auchan, which is an enormous market/they sell everything like target kind of place.  so one floor is all food etc, and the 2nd floor is all the equivalent of target, except less clothing i think.   so we'll buy a microwave/oven thing, bathroom and kitchen supplies, and then food.  the bulk stuff :) yay yay yay.  and we'll be with his parents and thus with a car. oh joys.

and then this weekend we're going to chatellerault for pierre's birthday!  oh and i need to sign up for the gym.  when i get a bank account and have money.  i kinda doubt the gym takes euro traveler's checks... highly doubtful.  highly annoying.  i guess i could call them. oh i can't wait. !!!!!!!!

"event","so the agency wasn't free today to do paperwork... and so we won't sign papers and move in until tuesday night.  which really SUCKS!

oh and Pierre has a million appointments on monday so that wasn't going to work.

one of the guys in the office is sitting next to me trying to learn english as i type... he's pretty funny.

anyways.... tonight we're doing shabbat at the grandparents', and then saturday i need to buy pants.  i've got one pair of work pants, and apparently that's not acceptable.  arg. i also want to go back to the chinese market to buy fruit.. the fruit in normal paris markets is too sour and disgusting :(  at the chinese market they have the weirdest things... they have some enormous things and i swear they look like porcupines.  ha

the oranges and mangoustines are yummy... and maybe we'll walk around paris and enjoy the sunshine if the weather decides to be friendly.

and then for valentine's day, pierre and i get an apartment. YAY. finally

work is fine... i finally got back the module the guys in india made from my storyboard mockup.  there were some mistakes (a couple screens... i couldn't believe how incredibly stupid they were) but mostly it was really cool.  right now i'm supposedly working on a new module on air conditioners, but then something else comes up that i have to deal with and it gets put aside.  i bet it won't be done for a week and a half at this rate... but whatever. castorama  (the client, they're the french equivalent of home depot or something) ordered around 100 modules, and they pay animedia through an escrow fund.  but they paid nothing upfront; so management is pushing hard for us to get them done so they get the money faster.  on the other hand, there's no real deadline and they're not going to be selling air conditioners for a few months obviously... so they don't care.  anyways just a little glimpse of my work :)

oh and today i worked on a feedback... so someone who i guess left animedia a couple months ago did a STB (storyboard) on freight security for truckdrivers. then it was made into a module, and he asked me to do the first feedback.  this was a couple weeks ago.  so i looked at the module next to the STB to make sure the guys in india developped it correctly.  for the animations and flash stuff, i took notes on necessary changes to be made and sent them the word document.  so then they looked at my feedback and fixed things.  and today gael (project manager) gave me the newest version of the module with my feedback from 2 weeks ago to make sure they changed everything.  so i do that, that's easy... now for changing the text, i just go into admin mode and change the text and click save on each screen.  given my excellent education and good habits :) i catch all the grammar mistakes and little things here and there.  (all in french). but there's a bug in the programming somewhere, and sometimes when i'm in admin mode the damn thing decides to freeze and then it decides to delete  all the navigation buttons and the texts in half the screens.  i only see that when i try to close and reopen the module.  it's a pain in the ass... so then i have to ask for the text files from the guys in india by yahoo messenger (everyone at work is on it), replace all the corrupted text files, and start over.  becuase when i replace them, let's say 3 of the screens decided to die, whatever spelling changes i made are gone.  and each time it happens the navigation text doc dies, so i have to copy and paste it again.... AAAA and so i can't use the convenient admin mode to make corrections; i have to stick with the text files which are annoying because the text is all out of context and there's font directions everywhere.  

so for anyone who decided to read all of that, that's what i do. sometimes.  but mostly i create storyboards, and that's way more fun."

"event","so we saw two apartments in one building in the 8th last night... one was on the 6th floor with an elevator that went from midway between the ground floor and the first floor and stopped midway between the 4th and 5th floors... very exciting evelator. pierre will never go in that elevator again. the building is owned by a family, all furnished apartments but it's like a hotel. so if something breaks, they fix it immediately.  even lightbulbs; they're replaced immediately. they clean the apartments once a week and change the sheets every 2 weeks.  i'm not sure if that means they take all the sheets and clean them and give you whatever's on top of the pile or if they replace the same ones in each apartment..

the first apt we spent a little while in, i didn't like it and was thankful that pierre didn't like the elevator and had vertigo looking out the window.  then we saw the second one, very expensive, much bigger but the same style.  the furniture's all really old (i thought it was crappy quality, but pierre says it's some classic style), kind of like being in someone's old countryside house.  the bed frames were just blocks of wood and the bed felt like a sack of hay i swear.  pierre loved it, it was big but the rooms were small with low ceilings. the neighborhood's very nice.  the apt has a bathtub and an oven in the kitchen... no washing machine or dishwasher.... but we could move in tonight if we wanted.  the woman's holding it for us until Saturday morning and we're going to see it again tonight.  

updates later... but we'll see.  we're seeing more places tonight and then tomorrow pap.fr comes out again, that's all the apartments from people who don't go through agencies.  i'll call at 9am and arrange visits ASAP to see if we can get something better.  although pierre loved it, i don't think i liked it... eh.  but he was convincing me for a couple hours that it would be nice and he was making me laugh and stuff trying to convince me.  i'll see it one more time... i was only in there for like 1 minute anyways because we (and the woman) were in a rush for other appointments.

ok time to work  on a new project... i finished the other one :)"

"event","we're going to see a one bedroom 40 sq. meters (www.onlineconversion.com) furnished apt in the 17th tomorrow night.  It's far from work, but I know Pierre loves the neighborhood because it's pleasant and safe and pretty, not touristy, relatively easy parking.  

We just keep calling agencies and keep looking... we're going to see some other place either tonight or wednesday night.  thursday night i'm getting a drink with my friend emerance... i met her last year at a bar where she was working at the coat check counter.  :)

and it's freezing.

right now i'm work.. i just finished the Case Study section of the module i'm working on (the one whose lesson i finished friday) and rachel was just going over it with me when her phone rang. so i'm updating the blog.  so far all good comments. :)  i like my work; i got lucky.  ah and work is over in 25 minutes :) if we don't have an apt to see tonight then i'm going straight to the american church in the 7th where there are supposedly apartment ads on a bulletin board.

joys joys joys here comes rachel"

"event","i went to this sale thing where all the money from coats sweaters shoes etc goes to some organization in israel. i got a sweater for pierre for 8 euros.  

i walked back to pierre's aunt's house (not where i'm staying, different aunt, myriam's house) and i swear the sun was glowing up the street between the old buildings.  it wasn't so cold today... but it's been SO cold. too cold to do anything i swear.

ok time for lunch :)"

"event","there's a song playing on the radio in mcdonald's here that we used in rush at sigma kappa... funny. memories.

don't worry too much though, only in mcdo for the internet.  i wanted to find this guy's number on fusuc, french usa contacts, a magazine also online that has housing offers.  this place looks great, one bedroom fully equipped for 890 euros.  i'm not counting on it or anything, but an apartment without an agency would be quite nice.  agencies are so expensive, esp for only 7 months.... 

the other apt we were just about to take fell through at the last minute.  owner decided to sell instead of rent.   that really sucked.

i enjoyed looking out the bus window today on the way to see another place... it had just started to snow, just little tiny flakes, with a bicycle path and a line of trees and old lamp posts. and walking with pierre along the canal after seeing the apartment... with the flakes of snow floating through the crisp still parisian air.... im in heaven.  but i need a place to live.  it's so annoying to be just sitting somewhere without y own kitchen, i can't make my own stuff,i can't bring lucnh to work, i can't wake up and do what i want. pierre is still me about some new compueter while i type whtout loooking at the keyboard. this si fun.   he says the compueter is like going to the moon.  pierre hopes his website will do well.... www.royalfleurs.com if you wanna check it out :)  

the apt we just saw was also near the canal, only one big room though not a separate bedroom. but a really nice bathroom.  well, big, with a bath/shower.  decent. bed's a piece of crap so we'd bring in our own.  it was 850 all included per month plus 900 in agency fees. that's a lot. but basically our budget gets one room furnished, or a one bedroom unfurnished.  it'sreally tough. i hope we find something nice. 

i don't like trying to decide between settling for an apartment that's only good enough and between waiting longer for something better.  bla.  we'll see.

but i like work. it's progessing quite well.

i'm working on a project about attic insulation.  i'm creating a complete learning module for employees of a big store called castorama- equivalent to home depot.  so i'm making a mock-up of what it will look like using Word with all the content, the lesson, and technical directions to guys in india who will develop it in flash.

oh oh the guy just called pierre.  i wonder what the guy is saying on the phone to pierre.  i want to see it first and i want to come with money to grab it if it's good. it's the one without an agency from a guy who posted on the usa thing. eeeeeeeeee i want i want.

i want to have a home... just like last year. a complete pain in the ass.

mwah! gros bisous and leave me messages, i love messages :)"

"event","the neighborhood is fine, there's a sort of minimall thing across the street with a market, boulangerie, a couple little cafes, other stuff, more suburb-oriented than paris, more practical than showy and quaint.

animedia has space on the 9th and 10th floors; i'm on the 10th floor.  there's a big open space and then a few offices for the bigshots of the firm, the owner, the CFO and the somebody else i don't know his exact title.  everyone except the owner, mark taib, is young, everyone seems friendly, it's a comfortable atmosphere.  not much teamwork though; most people just have their projects and they sit at their computers working on them.  the firm makes computer based animated training programs for big companies.  they're the market leader in france (banks, transportation, massive department stores, etc)

i'm going to continue this later..."

"event","i am so happy.  we both feel like we'd forgotten what it was like to be together.  we've looked at a couple of apartments, didn't like either.  but hopefully the one we're seeing tomorrow will be good.  it's supposedly big (don't know exactly, most likely close to 500 sq.ft.) one bedroom near the Canal St Martin for 850 euros per month plus maybe 500 in fees.  the real estate agent is pierre's friend so he's cutting us a deal and showing us what he thinks is a good place.  crossing our fingers..  i'd never seen the neighborhood before but we went to see another place nearby and i liked it.

oh and i got a new coat.  i was very happy; and the fact that it took a total of 15 mins to find it was the best part.  it's beautiful and rich looking, knee length, black, with beige fake fur lining you can see at the bottom, inside the hood, and at the sleeves if folded up a little, very warm.  oh my god i just looked at the label, it's pig skin! ok i'll have to get over that.  it's gorgeous and atypical.  and from rue du four, one of the best shopping streets in paris! hurray.

but there were so many bazillions of people, lining up outside of burberry, overflowing in zara, absolutely no room to walk through the sidewalks, but it was nice.  there's a beautiful light pink detailed jacket and matching skirt at one of my favorite stores for 135 euros... i'm going to wait and see if i get lucky enough for the price to go down some more and still be available in my size.  at least for the jacket.... aaaaahhhhh there's just no clothing in america like this for these prices!  yay for shopping in paris on sale.

oh and i'm very sorry to california, but even standard table wine is better than almost anything i've had at home.  hands down.  with strong goat cheese.... ahhhh.  yesterday my jet lagged self decided to wake up at 5:30am.  we got fresh croissants downstairs at 7:30am and then went back to bed.  it was amazing.  also had lunch at the boulangerie, some yummy chicken sandwich with a roquefort sauce... oh my god so fucking good.

oh and for apartments.... i ran into the owner of the apartments across the landing on the same floor of my old place, where stef used to live.  apparently the larger of the two apartments, not stef's but the other one, will be available on feb 15th.  it has a loft just like mine, but with a bathtub.  i don't know if it looks modern or older on the inside, but she said if i want it it's mine. so that's an intriguing alternative.  and i'm guessing the price would be 900 euros a month, no agency fees, plus electricity.

i love this neighborhood, the building, the boulangerie downstairs, all my memories are flooding back to me.  but another part of me wants to discover a new neighborhood, more residential, with more open markets nearby, a butcher, more living convenience, less designer clothing and jewelry.  that would also mean waiting 3 weeks.  we'd live in his grandparents' apartment, assuming they stay in cannes for the whole period (leaving today or something).  but if for some reason they come back earlier, that would be such a pain in the ass to have to move again and live on couches and stuff. 

it's a back up.  and a pretty damn nice one.  but i'd like the one his friend's going to show us.

today we're going to try and take a ride on one of those boats on the seine, find a good hotel for jenna for next weekend, and go to the SFR store to get a phone card maybe.  or maybe pierre has an extra card so i'll take his.  anyways, yay!! :)"

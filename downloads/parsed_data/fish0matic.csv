"event","I really appreciate the people who have told me that they like the yearbook this year. Truly, your comments make my days just a little bit brighter, especially when it seems like a lot of people hate our effort. Thanks guys, for not dwelling on our mistakes, but rather enjoying what we did do right.

I apologize to all those who feel personally wronged by the yearbook in some way. Chamber Chorale - I apologize profusely for the screwup in the clubs section - there was, most likely, a lack of communication between the person who took the picture and the editor who created the page, so the actual picture never got to the editor. I understand that you're upset about it, but please realize that the yearbook is not comprised of a single solitary photograph - our efforts are completely wasted if all you can think about is that one mistake."

"event","Why do I have to come off as being so sententious? I hate it, it drives me nuts, because I don't mean to be like that, I really don't. Whenever I tell someone not to do something immoral (as in cheating, cussing, etc) I just feel so overbearing and moralizing and it bugs the heck out of me, but I do it because it irks me more that people do stuff like that, especially people who know better.

And. I think I annoy people because I try to be morally upright, which isn't good because that defeats the whole purpose of being morally upright. I mean, it's to keep my morals, but I also want to set a good example, and if it annoys people, they won't exactly follow the example I'm trying to set! I don't do it because my ""goody-two-shoes"" reputation needs to be kept or whatever, but because I think I've hurt God enough with my life, and I strive to do my best to follow his commandments and to be more like Jesus. Of course, I usually fail miserably, contrary to popular belief. Really, I'm so judgemental and mean sometimes, I despise my behavior. Really. Not even kidding. I don't care how many rules I keep, I break just as many of God's guidelines.

By the way, sententious means ""giving advice in a self-righteous manner."" Not a good thing.

Wow, this is like my first LJ post in like... one heck of a long time. And don't try to convince me that I'm not sententious because I know you think so too."

"event","Yeah, I know what you're thinking. ANOTHER ONE?! But you know, nobody else can write from my point of view, so I feel compelled to write about it.

And what can I say about it? That it was absolutely amazing and that I really felt God's presence? Understatement of the year. Words could never describe the revelations that pounded me that night, but I'll try my best. I'm going to skip over all of the fluff about what I did before and after, and even what happened physically during the praise night. What I have to say is purely a reflection of what God did for me. And boy, did He do a heck of a lot.

From the very first deafening note that I sung during Saturday night, I felt God, flowing throughout the people and moving and compelling us to worship Him. Amidst all the singing and the guitar and the keyboard, all I could see that night was God, and it was an incredible sight indeed. God's power was truly revealed in the alter calls, in which at least 75% of those present got up, many shaken and crying, and went to the ministry team or down to the front, and bowed down in front of our Lord and Savior. God's face was seen in the sincerity of the worshippers, giving their all and shouting to the Lord. Most of all, I saw God in myself. As Leedah came down in front of the stage, where dozens of Christians littered the floor, and came up to us, placing his hand on our heads and calling to God. ""Touch him, God, touch him, touch him."" And what does God do? He smacks me across the face and pounds my head with His mighty fist, only then to take me up in His arms and love me. He did so much more than just <i>touch</i> me. That night, I broke. I felt the dirtiest that I'd ever felt in my life, yet I felt whiter than snow. God enveloped me in His everlasting light and truth and faithfulness and love, and I knew that nothing else mattered. I knew that, even if I failed all of my tests and dropped out of high school and become a bum and all of my friends abandoned me and my parents hated me, God would still love me with his eternal love, and he would tell me, ""Chris, you're My Beloved, and always will be."" And that would be more than enough for me.

Edit. Read <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~jenuinity/45645.html"">this</a> please. It's one of the best points I've heard, ever. I'm guilty of it myself, and I'm pretty sure most other Christians are too."

Why anybody would want to take a domain name ""www.fly-above.net"" and turn it into a porn site is beyond me. I'm sort of pissed off, but I guess I never really updated it that much anyways. I'll just concentrate on finishing my folio right now.

Wow, you know what? I like Mandy Moore. She's pretty cool. Her voice is pretty, and she's so much more <b>wholesome</b> than other popstars and ""musicians"" out there today. Yeah, that was pretty random. I know.

Finals are coming up. Surprisingly, I'm not worried at all. I think last year around this time, I was crazily stressing out over my finals. But this year, I'm so unconcerned. Chem is much more of a breeze than I thought it would be, so I'm not going to have to study too rigorously. English is easy stuff; I read part 3 of Metamorphosis during silent reading on the day of the test, and I got a 190/200 on the test. World History was always an easy class [I've gotten like C's on the tests and I still have a pretty solid A], and French should be okay. Interestingly enough, I'm more worried about French than I am about Chem. Heh...

I'm such a dork.

Anyways, I've been pretty busy lately. I don't know, it seems like my teachers are giving more and more homework as time progresses, and I really don't like the feeling of it. I used to spend like 30 mins-1 hour on my homework, and now I'm spending around 2-3 hours. Combine that with the yearbook deadline I just had to meet today (stayed afterschool), and my extra curricular stuff, and I'm getting a taste of what school is <i>supposed</i> to be like. Freshman year was a joke.

I'm nervous about my book-talk.

I've also been feeling quite distant from God - pray for me. I need more discipline. And I need to shield myself from Satan. Really, I do. Please pray."

Yeah, so I made the graphic, and looked up some overrides, and experimented with colors, and I got what you see here!

Hehe, yeah, I've been making kind of pointless posts lately, unfortunately, there hasn't been too many deep things to write about lately. Oh, but I did read Chicken Soup for the UNSINKABLE Soul again, and I'd forgotten how moving all of those stories really were! They talked about how they got through hardships, whether it be financial, or birth defects, or injury/disease, they all got through their hardships with the help of God and the support of their loved ones. The stories in that book really are excellent, you guys should all read it. IM me or something if you want to borrow it."

HAHAHAA. I was looking at a lot of other people's results on this, and like all of them were extremely negative. Stuff like ""...I hate you"" and ""F*** OFF"" and stuff. What do I get? ""LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED!"" WHOO! Awesome blossom. Anyways... maybe I'll be shallow and journal about how my day was or something. Or maybe I'll shamelessly plug the new layout for <b>ART & COMIC CLUB</b> which everyone should totally join next year.

So anyways, I think I'm kinda falling apart when it comes to doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I made a to-do list, and I've done like... one thing on the to-do list. That's really sad, considering that the one thing was to make the Art & Comic Club website. So pray for my un-procrastination, please, if you can. And also, I need to start reading the Bible more. Everytime I get bored, I think ""Ooh, perfect time to read the Bible"", but then I think of something to get out of it, which isn't good. BAD CHRIS. SO pray for that too. I think I'm gonna go read my Bible right now."

"event","Summer school. This has been an experience to remember. Where can I even begin to tell of the incredible learning experience this has been?

When I associate summer school with learning experience, it sort of implies that I'm learning academically - but that's definetely not the case. What I've learned from these 4 hard weeks of physical activity and hanging out with people whose primary purpose in life is to have sex with as many people as possible - it's purely spiritual. These past weeks have left me with incredible insight into the lifestyles of people outside of Mission and my church. It's given me a mindblowing look at the desires and daily lives of these people, and I must say, it wasn't pretty. These experiences have made me realize to what a <b>HUGE</b> extent that we truly, truly need Jesus.

Before these past 4 weeks at summer school, I really had no exposure to people outside of the Mission district and outside of my church. I was naive, unaware of all the crazy ghettoness that was out there. If any of you Mission people think that you're ghetto, you have NOT seen ghetto without coming to summer school. These people have underage smoking going on, they get high off of illegal drugs, and they have fake IDs to get into bars for some beers to get drunk. And to be hanging out with some of the worst of them - the people who actually <i>failed PE</i>, one of the easiest subjects in the world. I figured at the beginning of summer school that most of these people failed because they'd cut class to do drugs, they didn't dress, things like that. I also figured that there wouldn't be too many of those people, that summer school would mostly be people who were taking it for credits so that they could take extra courses in sophomore year. BOY, was I wrong. I've met some of the most interesting and <i>different</i> people I've ever met in my life. Everyday is a learning process for me, and I guess it pretty much started with a particular day at summer school, when we were in the Auxillary gym at Washington High for some indoor soccer.

<i>""Sup Chris!""</i>
<b>""Hello.""</b>
<i>[Frenchie proceeds to turn to his friend and chuckle, then pulls out some sort of membership card]</i>
<i>""Here, take it!""</i>
<i>[Tries to hand me the card - it turns out it's a 'Club Bev' card]</i>
<i>""Go out and get drunk and have a good time!""</i>
<b>""Um, no.""</b>
<i>""Go on!""</i>
<b>""No.""</b>

The first of many times that these people have tried to get me to do immoral things. Thankfully, I've had moral support, wonderful friends, and most importantly, God, who've all, in some way, made me a moral and, there's no other way to put this, a 'goody-two-shoes'. So, it wasn't hard to reject them. But the interaction that I've had with these people has completely changed my view of the world. Yeah, I always knew that the world was bad and that we were sinners, but I never really knew to what <b>great</b> of an extent that teenagers have gone to pleasure themselves and to have temporary highs. It's like Stacie Orrico's song, ""More to Life"".

<i>""There's gotta be more to life
than chasing down every temporary high
to satisfy me.""</i>

And the one thing that all of these people are missing in life, the <b>one thing</b> that would bring so much more satisfaction and righteousness to their superficial lives... it's God. It's so simple, yet so many people trade in morality and purity for worldy pleasures, even if they have to do immoral and sinful things to get them. I <i>know</i> that if only they had God in their lives, if only they knew what He'd done for us and just the immensity of God's grace and mercy and forgiveness and LOVE, their lives would be so different. It makes me realize how many people <i>truly need</i> God in their lives, and what a great need for Jesus there is in this world. It's like a bottomless hole, with the people of the world trying to fill it in with all sorts of different things to satisfy them, yet nothing can truly fill that hole except for God.

Another incident happened that shocked me completely. While walking alone on the track during second period, I overheard a girl talking to her friends about Christian Worship CD commercials. Unfortunately, it wasn't a pretty conversation. They talked about how the worship leaders were cute, if only they didn't sing about ""<b>Jesus and the Bible</b>"" (this was said in a very mocking voice). And as I stood there, watching that girl walk away, I couldn't help but stare at her shirt which read, ""People hate me."" And all I could think about was...

""...but God dosen't."""

[me-trying-to-put-the-deep-part-into-words]

I went to this retreat, having expectations to meet God and to have fun on the beach with awesome friends. And I came back, having exceeded my expectations tenfold. I can't make this entry a long, incredible story about how I was meeting God and crying and worshipping and praying. All I can do right now is to be honest with what I'd felt during this retreat, and the emotions and feelings that were running through my mind. This is <b>my</b> story, and I intend to tell it as <b>me</b>.

I guess when I first arrived at the camp, I really wasn't thinking about how I would encounter God or how emotional everyone would get or how I would be praying my butt off about all the issues that came up. I was only thinking about how I wanted to have a stellar time with my best friends, and how these three days would be the most fun-filled parent-free (ack) days of my life. And I <i>definetely</i> know now that it was the wrong kind of mindset to be in at our retreat. Thankfully, that mindset quickly changed.

Over the course of the next three days, amidst all the worshipping, the praying, the discussing, and the sermoning, I think I really gained one truly important value that I didn't realize I lacked before. When Andrew was praying for me about helping me forgive those who persecute and sin against me, I realized how important God was in my life. I realized that without God, I wouldn't have anything. I wouldn't exist as who I am today, Andrew wouldn't be praying for me at that instant, I wouldn't know that I needed to forgive people, and I would basically have NO value to my life whatsoever. I'd be a completely empty shell, with no real depth, and I'd be living a completely superficial life, devoid of anything true or genuine. I had never realized to what an extreme extent I needed God. I always took Him for granted ever since I had known Him, and this retreat served to remind me of my incredible need for Him.

[/me-trying-to-put-the-deep-part-into-words]

So.. I finally got that done. Random things about the retreat:
+ DUDE I couldn't sleep at all in the dorms! I roomed with a snorer, and the first night, I couldn't get ANY sleep and the next day, I was hecka sleepy! And also, every time you moved a finger, the beds squeaked really loudly. The second day I slept in the lobby, and I got 7.5 hours of sleep. :D
+ The beach was super fun. HAPPY HAPPY HERMIT CRABS DOMINATED!!! Actually we got third place, but yeah. Andrew was HILARIOUS! He kept 'inconspicuously' dumping sand into the other team's sandbox/coin thing, so that they'd have a harder time finding the coins.
+ Our sand castle was super :D All the freshies pitched in, so I dub it now, FRESHMEN FORTRESS!

Hyukhyuk! That's all folks, and remember: DECLARE your DEPENDENCY! Download the song too: ""Declaration of Dependence"" by Steven Curtis Chapman."

Well, I'm having one of those days. I feel like I have so much to do, with my online essay course (YUCK), homework, project, Chinese finals (BLEHHH), and a bio test coming up. SIIIGGGGH.

<lj-cut text=""About my previous entry (with some more of my personal opinions because I'm not going to be dishonest about them)"">
Overwhelming response to my last entry has made me decide to... do nothing about it. People can say what they want. Only one person on my comments page disagreed with me anyways. I just happen to have been researching on controversial religions, and I just happen to believe what I've been reading. And nobody's going to change my mind about that. No offense to ANYBODY, I repeat, ANYBODY, out there, but I <b>personally</b> (which means ME and ME and ME) think that a majority of the people in one certain religion that will currently remain unnamed have been... well... in a euphemism, ""misinformed"". I do. And I have further insight about that, but I'm not going to post it, because I don't want 18 comments on this post either.
</lj-cut>

Can you feel my aggravation?"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Read only if you won't get offended by my opinions of some certain religions."">Man, I've been reading up on all these different religions and stuff and how they contradict the Bible and their faults and it's so freaky to read about Catholicism and Islam and to know that people actually believe in these things. Now, before you jump on me, remember that this is MY JOURNAL where I express MY OPINIONS, so if you don't agree with me, that's fine, but don't go around saying how I'm a hater and that I need to have more respect. I have my reasons for saying that it's freaky that people actually believe in these things. Actually, for one of the religions, its very freaky, because a lot of people in that religion probably don't even know what they're truly believing in and what they're actually worshipping/praying to. And that religion is Islam.

It all started when an anonymous person and I started talking about religions, specifically about Islam. This person was telling me all the blasphemous things that the Islam beliefs and histories contain, and I was so shocked, because I do know people who are of this faith, and I'm very sure that they don't know these blasphemous things about their own religion. I mean, there's archaeological evidence that the Islam faith is actually a resurrection of the ancient moon-god cult! The ancient moon-god was also called Allah, and theres more proof that Mecca was actually built as a shrine to the moon-god O.O. And you know how Muslims supposedly believe in the Christian Old Testament of the Bible? So not true. The Koran contradicts so much of the Bible (which was written like a long time before the Koran was written) it's not even funny. Man, and their prophet, Mohammed? Dang, not a holy man <i>at all</i>. There are so many things I could ramble on about, but I'm going to stop before I make this a 20 page essay. There's more at:

http://www.africanaquatics.co.za/_christian/_articles/islam_and_the_koran.htm
http://www.africanaquatics.co.za/_christian/_articles/islam_peaceful.htm
http://www.africanaquatics.co.za/_christian/_articles/islam%26mohammed.htm

And Catholocism? Not even really Christianity. Their practices and stuff totally contradicts the Scripture, which is God's WORD! They added books to the Bible, which contradicts a verse in Revelations that says: ""I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes away from this book of prophesy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city."" This applies to Mormons too. Yeah... so anyways, if you're of these faiths and you're reading this right now, and you feel like strangling me to death, I can understand that. But don't, because we have something called the first amendment, so you can't legally persecute me for my opinions that are backed up with facts.</lj-cut>

I didn't even know if I wanted to post this."

<i>Jessica's Minispeech [penned by me :)]</i>
You should vote for me because I don't need to bribe the entire school for votes. I don't need to appeal to everyone's shallow sides by giving worthless gifts that prove nothing but that the candidate giving them dosen't believe in himself/herself. Gifts that show the discredibility of those who give them, and the intense disbelief that they have of their own qualifications. So, I urge you, vote based not on materialisitc principles, but on the true quality of those running.

Thanks Jen. I definetely realize the mistake in making that post. But like I said, (and I'm not condoning what I did), nobody has ever come close to insulting me like that before. Like to not know me, and then to diss me like they knew exactly who I was. But you're absolutely right, and I should have recognized it sooner.

Jesus died for everyone on the cross. Everyone. Including someone mentioned before, who I won't mention again. Everyone is reconciled. And we should treat each person accordingly. So to whoever commented on the last post, your support is appreciated, but it wasn't right for me to post what I posted.

unjeneral 12 2: so i learned that christian isnt about telling ppl what you blieve, but showing ppl when yer in the crappiest situations. its easy to be christian when yer happy, but you only shine when yer in crappy situations

So, **** thinks that she can call me gay without even knowing me. Well, that's all fine and dandy. It makes totally perfect sense that you can judge someone when you've never talked to them, hung around them, known them for over a week. But I wonder, did she know that it was called <b>PREJUDICE</b>? I doubt it. That really pisses me off. That people think that they can go around and trash people who they've never met, who they've never known, and then base some random assumptions about their personalities from, I don't know, watching them hang out with their friends? Does it ever occur to her that people have things called <b>FEELINGS</b>, and that those <b>FEELINGS</b> get hurt when you say bad things about them? People are entitled to their opinions, but people are also entitled to respect.

And another thing. She was obviously using 'gay' as an insult. This is another insight into the ""depth"" (if we can really call it that) of some people. To use 'gay' as an insult is basically insulting gays themselves, because you're saying that being gay is a bad thing. Wow. More prejudice.

Her comments really made me think about what the world has really come to. But it also makes me thankful. Why? Because I have these great friends that are able to see me, and that are able to accept me for <b>WHO I AM</b>. While certain people previously named in this entry can't be themselves. They have to try hard to be popular. They have to make themselves different from who they really are: insecure and in need of something true, something genuine to grasp on to. And they can't find it. They're just making it worse.

[enter superficial-chris-writing-for-his-audience-of-2 mode] <-- MAN, that's sad.

So on a lighter note, <b><font size=""+1"">TIFF'S BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP</font></b>! Wish her happy birthday when the 18th of May comes around. Or if you don't see her on Sundays, Friday the 16th would be good too.

It actually feels kinda good to be back to journalling. Kind of let out all my feelings, even though nobody is reading (but that's not the point of a journal anyways).

"event","it seems to be helping everyone else with their problems. journalling is a good way to express your feelings to yourself. okay. i'm feeling nausous. biology test on photosynthesis and respiration tomorrow, and i don't understand respiration at all. she told us that there was going to be an essay question. i'm going to do poorly, i can tell. but i have to have faith in God to do his work. grades isn't the most important thing in the world. i guess i have to learn to understand that. i've been feeling particularly spiritual lately, i don't know why. only now am i really beginning to understand the expanse of God's love for us, and how much i really want my friends to know that. i really do. they do things and say things that i know arent approved of, and that God is hurt by, and i wish that they could see something bigger and better working in their lives, because all of them are unique. they all have special talents and features about them, and God has a plan for them all. i wish i could help them see that. i want to be an evangelist! POO!

i feel like such a wannabe right now. i wanna be like jen. and tiff. and victor. and jason. they're all so close to God, they're all musically gifted, and they're all so willing. i wanna be like them. GAAAHH. i need to find my own person right now. am i really an artist? i dont know right now. it seems that web design is getting more tedious as i grow, and that it's not a hobby to me anymore. graphic design is great, but web design... art is become more of an obligation to be than something i really love to do. i want God to refresh my heart about it. i know that i love art, and that i want to do it as a job. but right now, im so unsure of what my place is. right now, i'm feeling really sinful about art, because i feel like i'm doing it solely because i'm good and i like people to notice that. like doing the websites for other people like jen and the church... it feels like i'm doing it just for me, like i want to be recognized for my talents and i want people to like me for that. but i shouldnt. God gave me these talents, and in turn, i feel i should use them humbly to serve him willingly. i mean, its okay to use them to do a job too like with jen and the church and stuff, but it shouldnt be for my recognition. something for me to pray about.

debate news... i'm thinking of compromising with my parents. they seem to want to to continue debate, so i'm going to make them an offer. if they let me quit chinese school, i'll continue with debate. i mean, i'm going to miss a lot of chinese school anyways because of debate, so why not drop out and spend more time on debate? the only thing i really despise is the case-writing, and the on-the-spot thinking skills that i know i lack."

"event","mm. by the way, to those of you who complain about me not journalling everyday and being a hypocrite, i really don't have any obligation to write every single day. only when i feel i have something to let out.

starting from friday. got 33/35 on my geography test, lowered my grade from a 105 to a 99.2. darn. but youth group was awesome, as usual. i loved worship and bible study, where we talked about Mark 8, where Jesus heals a blind man by spitting on his eyes, and then covering them and reopening them. it's interesting because the man's eyes were opened in two different ways. the first time, he regained physical sight, and the second time he regained sight as to know who Jesus was. ah, but the highlight of the night was small groups. i just let out all my feelings about my grandfather, and about his stubborn ways, and about how he disapproved of my faith and me going to youth grou and church. i told them about how he would use (if i got bad grades) my bad grades as an excuse to prevent me from going on fridays and sundays - ""church and youth group are preventing you from concentrating oh your studies! etc"". i told them how he uses the time constraints as an excuse - ""oh, but youth group ends so late, you won't get enough sleep, and besides, you have to wake up at 8:00 for chinese school!"". but they listened, and comforted, and prayed. auntie jane hugged me in the end, and tiff hugged me in the end, and God hugged me in the end. i wonder how i got to be so lucky of a person. praise the Lord, and exalt his grace and glory forever, for the name of our Savior will be lifted high.

saturday was a different story. not bad... but not good. the morning at chinese school was rather uneventful, besides getting an A+ in my makeup quiz. but at night, my family all went to my dad's office. his company is shutting down, and all the furniture, the software, the office supplies are all ours for the taking! of course, we have to share with the other employees, but still, it was pretty cool. as a matter of fact, im sitting an a very comfy office chair that we got from the conference room, and im using a free 1.8 gHz computer that we got a few days back. wow, beneath losing the job, God has definetely given us some benifets from the unemployment! ah. but the night wasnt over. we went to dinner at Korea House (which is an extremely awesome restaurant, i might add) and talked. about speech and debate. at first, they seemed okay with me wanting to quit, but then they started to ramble a bit about the benifets of it all. getting into a good college, getting a good job, getting into a good college, getting into a good college, making life easier, getting into a good college, and getting a good job are just some of the things they told me about. of course, i countered back with: i want to go into graphic design, i want to go to an art college, and speech and debate isnt everything. of course, they came back with the classic 'art is a very unsupportive career, you could very easily go without a job!' and it went on like that until we got home, where i had to go correct the wrongs on my math SAT1 test. and then i watched a rented Shallow Hal dvd. haha, it was a pretty cool movie. except i really hated that Mauricio guy or however you spell it. ruined Hal like heck.

and now, today! nothing eventful but church. church was great, obviously. victor did the message, and it was a good one, about forgiveness. i need to learn how to forgive those who have sinned against me, so when victor invited us to pray, i forgave my grandfather, and my parents. that felt good. return hate and evil with love and grace. oh, and i also volunteered to become an usher :D i feel so helpful today."

good Lord, are there many ignorant people here today. thanks to TIFO who got me some awesome verses:

<b>Matthew 5:10-12</b>
Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.

God understands because he's the one who decides what talents to give people. i don't care how freaking good i am with debate; i hate it and i think its a waste of time to dedicate so much of yourself to something that you don't love doing. why can't anyone understand that? i want to do what God desires me to do, and he dosen't want me to do debate. if he did, i would enjoy doing it. i would rather spend my time making graphics and painting and stuff, because its what i love to do! i don't care if it dosent mean anything on my stupid college application, and debate means so much. debate is just something that dosent make me happy. well, i just promised sara and chanukya that i would stay until september - october resolution is over. then i quit. of course, there's still my parents to convince. argh..."

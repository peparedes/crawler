my family is making me crazy(ier) doing things like:

eating thanksgiving dinner without me [for the second time in my life] because the ""turkey just got done earlier"" even though i arrived thirty minutes before i was supposed to. 

waiting till my cousin's girlfriend arrived before taking family pictures and then waiting till i had to leave before snapping the actual photos.

AND for three days in a row, intentionally not serving the fucking fabulous Black Forest cake from Moio's that i brought for dinner on Wednesday.

my family is so beyond explanation that maybe this will seem trivial to yinz but these are some crazy motherfuckers and it really makes it difficult living so damn close to these assholes.

alaska was straight insane. left anchorage on the sixth of september and im so glad to be back in the lower 48 and at the same time i miss it dearly. 

kicked it in the denali national park backcountry for about three weeks which included crossing the largest north flowing glacier [1.5 miles in 8 hours], fording countless glacial rivers [at a comfortable 36 degrees] and hiking for days in rain and snow. our last day was spent in a proper blizzard [august 8]. 
more birds than i could wrap my head around, black bears in the distance and caribou migrating for the winter. the denali massif taunted me at every turn, but i cant say i didnt love every minute of it.  

headed up to fairbanks for the sand hill crane migration and the fantastical chena river hot springs. i hope i never forget what it sounds like when a flock of sand hill cranes is flying over my head, heading south to mexico.  

ill be back in pittsburgh in about a month and it looks like thats where ill be nesting for the winter.

im in juneau, alaska!

have been here for about a week. ive been wanting to write but have wanted to wait till i was across those pesky borders to do so.

everything has worked out quite interestingly, as to be expected. in seattle i nearly lost it due to the overwhelming presence of crackheads and hippies but we made it on the barge like nothing. out of harbor island, after about 8 hours of laying on our necks we were finally moving into the ""inside passage"". im amped, we eat dinner and run around on our own personal cruise ship. its everything we could have imagined and more. perfect. another six days and we will be in anchorage. HAH. 
our first morning brings us to hot tea and crostini on the porch and early explorations of what the hell else is on this barge. we were too easily situated. the tug boat! so far ahead of us! turns around and begins to board [we had no idea what was going on until they were right next to the barge], we quickly hide onto our car but oh our lunch is everywhere! of all of the hundreds of cars on the damn barge they hop right onto ours. had no idea that we were even there until we were face to face with the operators. 
shit.
next stop, canada. or so we thought! 
not so!
they had us board the tug, cleaned out a private cabin for us and we were to ride with them until ketchikan. their private chef cooked three meals a day for us and we had our run of the whole ship.
of course the fbi, canadian government, ins and local police were all a tizzy about us but luckily since it was such a breach in security they were all so embarassed they wanted to tuck it right under the rug. no charges, just dropped off on the beach and that was that.  
thats the catch, however. ketchikan is roadless. ferrys are damn expensive but we paid the money anway and made it up to juneau in the next day. still roadless, but a bit of a healthier place to be. we leave for anchorage next week, after dropping a considerable amount of money we didnt have and are spending our time here hiking amongst bears, porcupines and loads of bald eagles.

congratulations to tom and kelly! ive had good wishes and thoughts of the two of you atop mountains near and far!"

sometimes its really really hard to live in an art studio. everywhere i look someone is doing something amazing and i just sit there with my head in my hands like duuuuuh. its really fucking hard to be surrounded by all of this when i have such an intense creative block. sometimes i feel as though its not even a block, but just the reality that i have lost all creativity. that i should just give up all attempts at trying to reconnect [or for fucks sake, connect] with it. 
i just want to lay around all day. my motivation is at an all time low and being in this environment just doesnt allow me to get past these issues. 
i had created a space for me, and me alone and that space was taken over by a house guest before i was even able to use it. he is gone now but i havent been up there once. its almost painful. tonight i am going to leave some salt on the ground of the space to see if it soaks up any of the negative energy that i feel but there is only so much salt in one bag. i feel lots of resentment towards this house guest as sometimes i get the notion that his occupation of my space allowed him to soak in all of the positivity i was attempting to create for myself.

there is a lot of negativity surrounding me and im just trying to deal with it, without absorbing it. this is proving to be harder than i thought.

im in key largo!

headed out of nashville on the Q127 to jacksonville on december 21st. found an empty 48 right quick and got cozy. it was a quick twenty four hour ride and all was good until we got to the jacksonville intermodal yard. instantly surrounded by cops once we got out of the yard. we chatted it up enough to get away without getting arrested. we did, however get ourselves registered in the CSX database thanks to the bull who was absurdly power hungry. luckily he was a steelers fan!
spent the next thirty six hours alongside a gas station fixing the bikes and talking this one awesome truck driver about panning for gold and other things we couldnt understand because he was constantly trailing off. smile and nod smile and nod.
made it into jacksonville and instantly ran into some awesome kids while on the search for shoes. they gave us shoes, a place to stay and generally good times. christmas eve found us at some scenester bar in jacksonville and me dancing with lots of people. i hate dancing with people. well men i guess. men i dont know anyway. i guess i feel like i have to dance with them and then that makes me feel violated somehow. i dont know.
we spent christmas day with this super awesome girl alex and her family. i drank lots of mimosas and called my family while lounging on the diving board to the pool. it was really nice and very christmassy which wasnt exactly what i had wanted but turned out to give me lots of warm fuzzy notions of the christmasses of my childhood.
headed out the day after christmas and slowly creeped to the coast. the bikes were running like dreams! once we were on A1A it began. i dont remember how long it took to get to daytona beach [we had acquired a ridiculous amount of dirtweed which makes this part of the trip very fuzzy]but id say maybe three days? in st. augustine we camped in a giant fort and in daytona we stayed in a massive abandoned restaurant on the bay. 
originally our intentions were to ride trains all the way to miami but after we got the business from the bull in jacksonville we thought it best to bike it. this was becoming tiresome and annoying as it was mostly strip mall after strip mall. as luck would have it we found a tiny little train yard in new smyrna beach that had a daily to miami! we hopped on a grainer at around 8pm and made it into miami just before the sun was coming up. nice and clean get away and there we were! the day before new years eve! 
once in miami we caught up with friends there and proceeded to party down on the beach. it continued at a house with a dance party but the music was so wack i just sat there. kids in miami have got some serious miami pride going on. spent the next day recuperating on south beach and decided to be fancy and get a hotel room that night. the night before last we ended up twenty four floors up on the roof of an hotel in mid construction drinking wine from a mysterious cellar in a secret freemason tunnel in asheville. soo good! 
headed out of miami yesterday after spending some time in little havana and caught what has to be the longest bus ride of my life [minus the dirty dog of course]to florida city. ate some pizza, fell asleep and rode to key largo today! i saw my life flash before my eyes a few times as NO ONE here knows how to share the road. 
we are about 100 miles to key west and im lazy as fuck these days as far as riding goes so we are going to crash on the beach tonight and make more tracks tomorrow. 
my bike is treating me so fucking right. shes a univega safari ten road bike and i built her the day before i left. i had never even ridden here until we were in jacksonville. stuffed to the gills with crap shes still a light ride!

this trip has been fairly chill for the most part and it looks like we may be in the florida area for the next few weeks. i guess we are heading down alligator alley once we get out of the keys so that should be interesting. i dont even know where we can camp during that part!

hope all is well wherever you sweet folks are and life is treating yall good!

"event","in eighteen hours i am supposed to have a bike, panniers packed and be on my way to key west via nashville. my bike has no seat, rear derailleur or brakes and my panniers just got painted and probably wont dry for another 10 hours. the place is trashed and in total chaos with boxes of half packed/wrapped presents sitting everywhere. there is a fridge full of fresh produce that most likely will NOT get eaten in the next eighteen hours unless i were to spend at least four cooking it all. the couch we had planned on bringing into the space tonight has apparently just been destroyed by some random person.
and the sewing machine just. stopped. working.

this is not me complaining.

"event","ok.

ive been trying to think of how best to convey my experiences for a while now. every night i was in new orleans i sat with a pen and notebook trying to start some sort of summation of that day but i was never able to get much down. it was just so goddamned overwhelming.

ill attempt this in some sort of chronological fashion. there will be pictures to accompany this, just not at the present time. 

we headed out to the school of americas protest in fort benning georgia on saturday [11.18]. this is such an established protest that its much more symbolic and ritualistic than anything else. the procession is what we happened upon on sunday morning where they read out the names of innocent people who were murdered by the hands of our government. there were about 20,000 people there. 
we met up with our friend Cen and headed to New Orleans late sunday night. We arrived in the dark so the amount of devastation we saw was limited, other than their being no working street lights or electricity in general. Monday morning crews were organized and everyone sent on their way. at this point i would say there were roughly 100 people there, more expected to arrive every day. Luckily we had our bikes so we headed out to our jobsite [in entirely the wrong direction]. It was starting to sink in. the serious amount of destruction in our area [St. Cloud st, Ninth Ward] was overwhelming.  Every house has some sort of message on it, HELP! or DOG! and lots of things that just dont make sense. Our jobsite was a community center that was attached to a baptist church. Every structure in the Ninth Ward needs to be gutted. The mold levels here are totally out of control. We are armed with Tyvex suits and respirators just for street cleaning.  Our crew of about 30 is totally cleaning and detoxing the communtiy center to keep it for a year for programs like cop watch and food distribution. After the year is up we hand it back to the church.  
There are other crews out on house cleaning duties and im told that overall there were 30 houses that were cleaned and gutted during the week.  
There are lots of folks in the community cleaning out their own houses or their family members along side our crews with NO  protection at all! We were the only ones with these tools.  I cant imagine what the health consequences of this are going to be but if there was anything that the people need down there, i would say its respirators[n-95] and tyvex suits. this shit is so toxic that we had to decontaminate and shower before we entered our living quarters at all.  
Monday night we headed into the french quarter which was just a few blocks down from our warehouse.  you would never guess that there was a hurricane here. i realize that this area was mostly spared as far as the actual hurricane damage but people are still out drinking on bourbon like nothing happened. Except now there are military police on every corner and not so many breasts exposed.  
Tuesday and Wednesday brought more of the same, and now the impact is really sinking in. This work that we are doing, this physical labor and all this is important but symbolically its so fucking heavy. There are so many social injustices going on here its absurd.  The power that should be on in the ninth ward is being diverted to more affluent neighborhoods. These people wont have power for the next SIX MONTHS!!!! SIX MONTHS! People have been displaced across the country and wont realistically find it feasable to return for six months [if at all].  What will they return to? a notice that the us government has taken everything they owned and deemed it trash.  We found these notices in a neighborhood adjacent to the superdome where we were working for the ASPCA doing food drops for stray dogs and cats still roaming the streets.  This area is fucking ROUGH. There is no one in the streets here, there will be no one returning and i can only imagine that developers are just drooling imagining how they can turn this area into bullshit condos and townhomes priced far out of the range for the former residents.  You walk down the street, which is entirely dark in some sections and feel soemthing in your hair, what is it? oh just downed power lines that are dangling from a tree or a broken sign. This is how it is for such a large part of the city its absurd. Its not the garden district! its not the French Quarter! those areas are looking as beautiful as ever. Its the poor districts that surround, sit next to or are nearby that there has been nothing done. FEMA drives around in a truck and gives out hot dogs. Their massive cruise ship is docked on the Mississipi. 
The Rainbow Family has been there since the flooding as well. They are serving three hot meals a day for people in Washington Park and apparently yesterday they were shut down by the city. Evicted just like that. 

Im not sure what has been reported in the news because i dont have television and rarely listen to anything but NPR on the radio, but the Gretna bridge story is fucking insane. There are so many stories that are so fucked. I dont even know where to begin.

We went down to the bayou on Friday, Houma to be specific to work in an outreach center there for a few days. Houma area wasnt devastated from Katrina, Rita had much more of an impact. When you get into Houma there is a giant sign that says ""halliburton welcomes you to houma"" oh that feels good. We took the car out to an area called Bayou Du Large which was a small road along side canals and rivers. this area is incredibly impoverished and people here too are cleaning out their homes with nothing protecting them.  Most of these people make their money from Shrimping in the area. I cant imagine how toxic that shit is because all you can see in the distance is giant oil rigs and refineries.  The end of the road is always a haliburton plant. but these peolpe were left with little to no aid. we went door to door with boxes of food, baby supplies and cleaning supplies and they were shocked. 
One couple we met had met in a red cross line somewhere between here and new orleans. he evacuated from the city by boat to her house and has been docked there ever since. so sweet!

I dont know, am i able to convey the gravity of this situation with my poor atttempt at writing? There is just so much i want to say but i still need time to think and process it. 
One thing i want to ad is that the organization i worked with was Common Ground. [commongroundrelief.org] I dont think ive mentioned this before and wanted to put their information out there so that you know that there are solid organizations that are making a difference where there is no one else. Malik Rahim is one of the co-founders of the organization, a former panther and current green party affiliate.  He brougt with him so many of his old school activists its crazy. Spike Lee was on site filming on Sunday and Malik is in this months GQ.

We are headed back down once Chandler is done with school at some point at the end of December. 

i dont know what else to say at this point, i suppose a poingant conclusion would be in order but im totally at a loss. more later when i can fully articulate what is going on. i just wanted to get this information out there.

"event","there are ""dog people"" next door. as in, show dog people. they use a very large indoor facility to facilitate their problems with themselves [via these poor poor confused creatures]. they are grouchy, mean people who dont like anyone but other show dog crazies and their unfortunate pups. they like to weld giant blast doors closed to keep us from our fuse boxes and hot water. they are unable to talk about things unrelated to showing dogs, training dogs, cleaing up show dog poo, and welding blast doors shut to prohibit people from accessing things essential to their work. they will also occasionally talk about giant chains that keep these doors from being opened to those of us in the non show dog world. 
however! we are a crafty bunch equipped with tools that show dogs would never need and we can unweld doors and break chains and dance around pits of fire because we dont have to get up the next day to show our dogs in some rundown mall in the middle of nowhere, north carolina. 
the show dog folk, they think they are smarter than us and drill more holes into the wall and put up more chains. but now, ohh now it is our day in the sun. while they can put up chains they are not strong enough to open the blast door to retrieve their precious chains that now rest, permanently, on OUR side of the world.

i sm hungry and our stove has been out of propane for two days now. chandler the wonderboy will return in an hour and hopefully whisk me away to somewhere awesome for food consumption. he should be equally hungry as he left the lunch i carefully packed for him sitting on the stairs. it was a fab lunch let me tell you. everything bagel with sprouts, tomatoes and fresh mozz, jalapeno terra chips and some fruit. its the little things that get me excited, like balanced lunches. if i didnt have such a desire to eat out i would have eaten said sandwich upon discovery. it would probably be more financially sound of me to just throw some potatoes in the oven and be done with it, but oh i have a not so secret love for dining out.

"event","back in asheville!

wednesday was our last day of work  [we didnt know until five minutes before our shift was over].  took the scenic route back via minneapolis, madison and chicago.  ate at the hard times in minneapolis [LOVE that place], hit whole foods hard in wisconsin and drove around aimlessly in downtown chicago until we finally made it to milwaukee ave where records were purchased and went off to see The Coup  [with a small stop to target to get a proper oven for the space].  The Coup show cost  eighteen dollars! and i opted to sleep in the car so chandler could go.  we initially had talked the doorman into letting us in when the Coup went on for a mere 10 clams each but he was nowhere to be seen when the time came. my sleeping bag is way too warm to convince me to move so i stayed there during the show. it would seem ive turned into a grandma when it comes to actually going out these days. 

came back to find a rotten banana had straight funked up the place and the 'b' and 'g' keys on the keyboard are now near broken which is frustrating as all hell. ive scrubbed and scrubbbed this place but that rotten smell just wont leave. 

apparently we took the weather with us from north dakota as its the same fucking temperature here as it is there! what the fuck is this shit! the studio has one space heater which is a radiator under the computer. i plan to be parked here till at least april. 

luckily the time spent in ""Minn-Kota' was far more than worth it and ive got lots of ideas to keep me busy for quite some time. originally the plan was to head to pittsburgh for thanksgiving and my grandmother's eightieth birthday but now it looks like there is an opportunity for us to head to New Orleans and volunteer for a few weeks if not longer. Im sure i wont be missed around the table as in previous years they have not even waited till i arrived to eat dinner. [I arrived twenty minutes before i was told to be there to find my whole family nearly finished with thanksgiving dinner. the reason sited was that the turkey was done early. HAH] So hopefully i wont need to get one of those pesky jobs until i come back from New Orleans, unless i decide to work as a seamstress downstairs for peanuts a few days a week. 

we've been here about four days and already the place seems to be bursting at the seams in clutter. today i plan on overdosing in ginseng and restoring the studio to its former glory. i cannot function in clutter.

and goddamn. i live in asheville, north carolina and i cannot find any weed to save my life. ive got money to burn for once! arrrrgh!"

"event","the days are just flying by here in the ""upper midwest"".  my days are filled with sugar beets, sugar beets and more sugar beets. just when i think i cant look at another one, a few more semi trucks will show up to remind me that it just doesnt stop. [ok, it will stop in about five or six days so ive been told] the beet piles are about twenty three feet [i originally typed beet] and growing in length. my ""job"" for the entire twelve hours is to pull a lever according to our ""tare sheet"" and seal the bag the beets are in. when im not doing that task i occasionally will ""work the lights"" which means i direct the truckers on how and when to dump their loads. NOT spilling the beets is a big deal and ive let out a few squeals on some close calls but havent dropped but one or two beets. there is A LOT of downtime that inclues huddling by the space heater, scraping the endless pile of mud that is in front of my ""tare shack"" and not falling asleep. getting up for work at midnight is insane. im pretty much worthless from the hours of four am to seven am when the blessed sun finally shows up. during those hours i am usually falling asleep on the space heater or at my post directing truckers. luckily my coworkers are sympathetic to my complete inability to stay awake while standing up and will usually pull the switches, nudge me or occasionally bang something REALLY loud next to me. luckily we take breaktime very liberally here and my first hour break for the day is usually spent sleeping on the beet pile or in my car. the beets are warm and quite like the tempur-pedic bed and sort of just conform to your body. its luxurious. our coworkers are both old retired farmers who button their plaid shirts right up to the top and say things like ""gosh darnit"" and ""oh golly"". the accent is hilarious and ive learned all about the differences between ""dinner"" and ""supper"" and hunting.  
my first actual week of work was almost two weeks ago but it hasnt been going at full speet until last thursday. before then my time was spent in between my lovely camp site and my new luxurious accomodations in a massive, beautiful log cabin in minnesota situated between two lakes.  an older couple that i work with had taken me in for about a weeks time and have been like the grandparents ive never had. pancake breakfasts every morning, boat rides before ""dinner"" and lots of ATV ridin' in between.  its been insane. their property is beautiful and they just welcomed me into their home like i was one of their own. i cant even begin to write about all of the amazing things that ive experienced, they're still sinking in and i want to do them justice.  
our time here in minnesota/north dakota is drawing to an end and i cant say im sad to end these insane hours of work and camping every night in near freezing conditions but i will sure miss all of the wholesome goodness i have been able to soak in. supposedly we will be done come sunday and then head back to asheville for a nice long while. all i can think of is the queen mattress, 450 threadcount sheets and sleeping for at least two days straight.

more when my eyes arent red and my head isnt spinning..

beet harvesting has begun!

so far it seems ridiculously easy. im a ""taretaker"" and basically take a small bag of samples from designated trucks that haul the beets to our piles. when im not taking samples i get to drive around a bobcat, scrape mud off the machines and just hang out. apparently there is a lot of hanging out. our entire operation is putting beets into piles. really, thats it. giant piles. i greased some sockets and got acclimated with the whole operation for a bit and that was it for the day. 
the folk i am working with are mostly older locals who seem to have known each other from birth. there are grills set up and apparently for most of the shifts there is someone cooking for the whole group. 
tomorrow i start at 6:30am which means i have to be up by 5 to make it out there on my bike by then. luckily i am an early riser! tomorrow will be the first of many 12 hour shifts.

lots of wildlife has been crossing my path these days. giant water bugs are falling from the sky [really creepy looking motherfuckers] and a wolverine walked across my blanket a few days back. yes a real wolverine! there is a heron that greets my campsite daily and lots of swallows and loons about. 

life is good, chandlerpants and shank the wonder dog will be getting up here mid afternoon on saturday and i can hardly wait! 

there aint much else going on here other than me successfully infiltrating the NDSCS campus and making the lounge area my own to watch the steelers game and generally laze about on the rainy days. oh AND my new Stanley thermos! this crazy thing keeps water scalding hot for days! days i tell you!

"event","i am procrastinating so hard right now.

from what you ask? oh chandler's homework and generally life itself. have no fear im still in love with everything around me right now [especially today but ill get to that later] im just wanting time to go a little bit faster. 
i went to bed last night around 12ish after painting a box for a solid three hours. i wanted to stay awake for coast to coast but instead i only heard the NASCAR report and then some football show where they tear into the coach of the Minnesota Vikings. [have i told you that i am absolutely addicted to talk radio?]when it came time for 12 to roll around i was ready for sleep. This is not m.o. for me as i have started to keep very late hours working in the studio as i dont really have a set time for waking up. However, my car is not the studio and its not like i have much light [i do have a fabulous Petzl headlamp that blinds me constantly when it catches on the reflection of the glass or rear view mirror. [I didnt know this was a fabulous headlamp when it was given to me, but after finding out it cost around eighty bucks i made a point to ask some poor soul at EMS WHY it is so great. im not sure he really proved anything to me, but he deemed it so. and so it is. motherfucker is BRIGHT]] This has become a very long winded way of simply stating that i woke up at six unable to go back to sleep. ok, so its the equinox and it was rad to see the sun rise and all that jazz but damn im tired already and its just four in the afternoon. 

but now let me tell you why today was so awesome. after i took my usual roundabout way of exiting my campsite so as no dirt bikes or motorcycles try to chase me down for stealing their vegetables [no i would never they are just paranoid] i came upon a discovery of hundreds of swallow nests along the bridge i ride under. hundreds i tell you! so amazing. i met a Mr. Pinkey on the other side of the bridge who engaged me in some conversation about life, his family history, whether i was jewish or not, a very long winded story about how he almost blacked out but used the powers of christ to save himself from death and said goodbye while making these very odd hand gestures and telling me im going to have an amazing time at the beet harvest, he just knows it!!  talk about a good start to a day. 
hit up the post office post mr. pinkey and debated on whether or not to eat lunch at the local chinese buffet as i am running low on cash and the cashman, or my dearest chandler, doesnt arrive till NEXT saturday.  i hit up the local fashion district [j.c. penney's] for work gloves and came out to say hello to two toddlers walking down the street with their momma. we all shared smiles and a general fascination for the train whistles blowing in the distance and that was all. i watched the train roll by and they went on. i finally convinced myself that i deserved this lunch, after all i had just spent nearly six dollars mailing things to various folk and shit, i can afford six dollars on myself. i hit that chinese buffet hard. HARD. and it was so worth it. i notice that the family that i passed earlier was dining there as well but never made eye contact with them and continued to read a short story [""please dont talk about me when im gone"" nelson algren].  ive decided that ive definitely eaten way too many sugar donuts and begin to make my exit when the girl at the counter tells me that the woman paid for my lunch already! PAID FOR MY LUNCH!!!! i couldnt believe it. of course i showered her with thanks but decided to skip the whole story about me debating on whether or not i should spend the money..etc. gosh, ive never had anyone do that for me and it was amazing. so amazing that i forgot my fortune cookie. [i have since decided that my day has been so loaded with fortune cookies i need not ask for more]
hit up the Red River Valley train yard and decide that i shall not be riding any trains around here. spokane, washington sounds amazing but im sure it would probably take a week to get there and it would definitely screw up the whole reason i came here. 
i am, however going to be heading out on bike to visit some of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes come saturday which will hopefully take me a few days away from here and give me some time to not miss the boy so much.

its chilly here but my super mega thermal marmot sleeping bag is the bezknez [a license plate i saw yesterday] when it comes to warmth. 
i am craving Perrier's Fluo and thought for a second i might be able to acquire it here, being so close to canada and all, but no. Sierra Mist is no Fluo, let me tell you.

im ready to curl up for sleeps but will continue to persevere till at least eight pm tonight on this bastard homework. i try to stay out till at least dark to sneak back into the spot so folks dont know that i am merely a single woman sleeping alone in the woods. im pretty sure it hasnt been blown up yet, but it could be any day really. i lock my doors and go to sleep with good thoughts that folk from the adjacent housing community dont come stumbling around to my little place in the cut. 
[i have a strong, very rational [i think] fear of the crazies]

im here in north dakota, anxiously awaiting the beet harvest. it would appear that it doesnt start for another week or so which gives me lots of time to sit and ponder life along the bank of the Red River that i currently call home. 
my only friends here are the folks who work at the print shop ""downtown"" [Wahpeton, ND] and the mosquitos. the mosquitos definitely love me the best and spend most of their time following me around and yearning to get closer to me than i would like them to. luckily ive decided to chuck the ""frou frou"" organic bug spray that usually does the trick and decided that living on the egde is really what 26 is going to be about and am now armed with 100% deet 100% of the time.  
my days thus far have been spent reading, writing, painting and riding my bike around on the ridiculously flat land that i have come to greatly appreciate [but damn, i really miss coasting!]. how lucky am i? its beautiful here, there are giant fields of sunflowers all with their heads bowed down to the earth and cornfield after cornfield after cornfield after cornfield.  yesterday i had a staring contest with a heron and a frog in the pocket of my overalls whilst i tried to clean him off after being sprayed with pesticides.  
the loons are practicing their migration formations right along side my little spot on the river and there are GIANT fish that flop about from time to time [although im never quick enough to actually SEE it happen], i just know they are huge because occasionally one will come close enough to the surface for me to catch a glimpse.  
Chandler, my sweetest one, comes up here in about a weeks time to work the harvest with me. His cutesy little craftschool has allowed him the time off from his classes so he can have this 'experience' [but really its just so we can double the money that we will hopefully be making]. 

The townsfolk are ridiculously friendly, as everyone seems to be generally happy and helpful. My mother, being the all knowing insane-o-woman that she is told me to expect the scum of the earth, as she knows, from working on her family farm as a child. When i told her i had encountered the exact opposite she still didnt believe me and told me to wait till im actually working. Ill be sure to update on the status of her prediction as soon as i can. 
 
The North Dakota State University of Science is here and this afternoon i attempted to get an honest to goodness 'free lunch'.  what i got was a plate of mashed potatoes and a few pieces of chocolate cake as there isnt a thing in their cafeteria that doesnt have meat on it. The library here is fantabulous and open till 10pm at night which is where i have been spending my evenings doing the boy's homework. Its fun to pretend to be in school [well, not really this particular school, but the idea of school i guess] but it makes me realize that i NEED to get back into school, this time for serious.  

Life is generally good these days, well who am i kidding, its great. I cant complain about a thing really and i cant imagine wanting to at the moment. Ive made these decisions, ive chosen this path and so far it seems to be doing me really fucking well.  
So here i am, twenty six years old and in North Dakota. Never in my wildest thoughts did i ever imagine myself in North Dakota at twenty six, but fuck it. 
here i am and goddammit, i ain't mindin' a bit.

came back to make a fabulous rainbow egg sandwich for the boys breakfast [and managing to pack a beautifully well balanced lunch in the meantime] so he could head off to his posh [hah!] art school for the day [all in the time it took him to brush his teeth].  
im so fucking domesticated it hurts. 

tomorrow i am heading north. fargo, north dakota that is, to harvest sugar beets and camp in the frigid cold for two weeks and hopefully clear a solid three grand. 
i had intentions on being all old timey and riding freight trains there but if im not there by monday there aint no job for me.

spent the weekend in knoxville [i seriously hope i never have to go to there again] to grab the last of my things from the KFAR radio trailer where i resided for a brief time. kfar is a pirate radio station that has since gone the way of many other pirate radio stations and only broadcasts on the interweb after a nice ol' raid by the FCC. its a sweet little place but nothing i could ever call home.  

weve been redecorating the studio and now its very cushy and posh [much like me of course] and such a welcoming sight to come home to. we nearly parted ways attempting to paint a gradiant fade? on the walls but luckily it all came out well and our walls fade from a dark navy to a sweet sky blue up in the upper loft. chandler being the crafty devil that he is built a staircase that doubles as shelving and fashioned fancy cabinet doors onto our crappy particle board pantry. the silk screening studio is kickin with loads of new paints and screens for me to waste my days away with and there is now a welding space complete with a full torch set [?!?!?!] where there once was a bunch of junk [dont tell chandler i said that!]. 

my birthday is a few days away but i shall spend it in the field workin' like a good ol' farm girl should. twenty fucking six years old. i cant even wrap my head around that.

i cooked eggs for myself today, for the first time in possibly 15 years and they tasted GOOD! 

now its time to ""red up"" the place and pack for the dakotas! think good thoughts about me not freezing to death at night!!!

the left shift key on this keyboard is broken. you have no idea how much of a pain that is!!!!

being home is nice.

made it home last night around 3am. chandler drove the whole way home like a good little boy even though he had his first class at 8AM. after going through and oogling over lots of his <A HREF = ""http://www.jablonka.net/html/linden/050500/20.html"">aunt's</A> old belongings we spent the last four days of our vacation out on cape cod where all good vacations go to die. it was a bit weird at first as we were hanging out with the boy-who-broke-my-heart-last-september-but-lived-and-traveled-with-me-till-april  who is an old friend of chandler's [and most of my friends in new england].  but luckily things were fine after a bit and we all got along swimmingly.  my best girl jen lives in this house right in ""downtown"" provincetown [very tip of cape cod] that houses lots of wayward drunken old fishermen.  its an amazing place to stay amidst all the ""la la"" fancy people that vacation there. it really gives off the true old-timey essence of living by the sea.  
cape cod [p-town in particular] is a place that really inspires you. not because everyone around you is probably a homosexual but just for its feeling of complete and total isolation from the rest of the world.

at this point im ready to just go to sleep but there are collards to be cooked and sour cream to be consumed."

just got back from a whirlwind two weeks up the coast of maine and into montreal. started two tuesdays ago in boston, looking to get to halifax. that line discontinued and there wasnt shit else at the yard. booked it up to portland, maine after spending one night in kennebunk. still hadnt seen the ocean yet [not cool]. portland to lewiston maine where we caught to montreal. montreal became sherbrooke [100 miles east of montreal] and being stuck in an entirely french speaking town for two days. [the four years of french i had long long ago were laughable at best, but seemed to come back quick] 
caught out of sherbrooke and got pulled off a lumber car in iberville [only about 40 miles east of montreal at this point] met some crazy old woman on a bike who let us stay with her that night. we discussed her crazy mother, her crazy neighbors and other crazy things that happen to her. she was sweet and initially offered us a ride to montreal. after a celery salt omelet the next morning she told us to hitchhike from her house instead. after four long days we finally made it into montreal thanks to an off duty cop who gave us a lift into westmont. 
the dog who finds time in his schedule to accompany us on our adventure wears these adorable little paniers on his back that carry his food and other doglike accessories [patented cooling bandana, massage brush and the occasional pup power bar]. people love these things and are constantly remarking about them. as we were getting sodas in a convenience store the dog was charming the pants off of some apparently well off gentleman, to the tune of a freaking 100 dollar bill that he gave me when i came outside. insanity! after wrapping our heads around how that happened we did laundry in our swimming suits and wandered around montreal in clean clothes! luxury! 
montreal is an amazing city! met up with some folks for some drinkin' in the park and general tomfoolery and happened upon this giant street festival where we had at least five security guards trying to tackle us because no dogs were allowed. amazingly [in french] we got out quickly and continued on our merry way. this continued for a few days until we hit LUSH!  got some fancy soap products and shitty indian food and decided after our last very long night of partying in montreal that we were ready to return to the states. oh the glorious united states of america where things arent outrageously expensive and people are quirky but at least speak english.  the states are however, without the greatest drink of the summer.  FLUO a cherry ginger spritzer made by perrier that is pink and just fabulous.  
after taking a day and hiking out to the yard [pausing at the salvation army which was a sea of insanely fancy namebrands! hellooo pink Lilly skirt!] we catch out gondola style around 7pm saturday. no sweat [aside from building a bridge last minute to cross the moat that surrounds CN's insane-o yard] and no water and we are back in the states after about 10 hours of 5mph traveling. 24 hours brings us to just outside of syracuse where my whole world basically collapses. i jump out to get water and as i am fending off the pack of mosquitos who are attacking me i hear the brake release. thinking it didnt sound like the usual brake release i continue on. all of a sudden the cars start to move. im in a sea of closed boxcars and cant jump onto anything. panic mode sets in and i start running to our car. by the time i get there shit has picked up the pace and the train just goes right by me. one thing we never discussed was what happens when one of us misses the train, cause thats just not supposed to happen. HAH. so here i am, about 40 miles outside of syracuse in the middle of a fucking swamp where my only possession is an empty nalgene bottle. luckily for me i stumble upon the nicest couple of people ever and they are ""up for an adventure"" to track down the train! no luck and they drive me the 40 miles to the syracuse CSX yard where it should be rolling through at some point. its stated that the syracuse yardworkers are friendly and that is no joke. i met up with the crew that would be taking over the train onto its final destination [just outside of albany] and explained my situation. they promised to stop the train inside the yard and allow me to jump back onto it. unfortunatly when they did roll through they didnt stop or slow down enough for me to jump back onto it and im pretty sure if the boy hadnt hopped out already he was fast asleep. so here i am in east syracuse with a fantastic care package put together by tammy and andy [the couple who drove me down there] and five dollars in change that they gave me. i spent the night in a convenience store next to a woman who was going through lottery tickets like crazy. she didnt win and their phone card machine was broken so i was assed out. called my papa and after a proper ear beating he got me a phonecard. i trudge out on the highway to hitchike solo [yikes!] to providence and make it about 15 minutes before i get pulled off by the first cop. he drives me another 15 miles or so to a nowheresville onramp where i try again for about an hour. luckily i get picked up by a super friendly dad like guy who gives me 10 dollars and takes me to utica. after getting pulled off the highway twice and threatened to be arrested if they see me again i decide its time to call ol pops again and get me a bus ticket. pops always comes through and here i am in providence, ri at the boy's aunts house awaiting the arrive of the boy and the dog. im nervous that something happened to them [god forbid they actually call one of us] but i know the unreliability of what was ahead of them [plus now having to carry two extra bags [i hope anyway] of stuff]. 
im happy to be done with the stresses of hard travellin' for the moment and looking forward to spending the rest of the week on the beach in good ol' cape cod. 
if you made it this far im quite impressed!
until next time...

took five days to get here. left early wednesday morning after getting poked with an inky stick for like four hours the night previous. made it to buffalo [eek!] and attempted to catch out to toronto. no dice and headed to niagara falls before something really bad happened. buffalo is intense. niagara falls was spent coming quite close to maiming will smith and his son with one of the bikes and laying in the sun.  luckily will smith was cool and wasnt to taken aback by a fallen bike. the whole family was there as i guess jada is performing at ozzfest which happened to be in town that same day. 
ended up at some odd fancy street festival in youngstown, ny that was entirely devoid of anyone in their twenties [good call kids].  headed out to rochester listening to plastikman on the radio!
rochester, syracuse, albany its all a blur. 
made it to providence last night to some big fancy loft party where there was a two piece electro duo playing in daisy dukes. shocking.
chillin' at his aunt's house at the moment while shes in the hamptons for the weekend. the car got broken into last night [well chandler left the door unlocked] but as far as we can tell they just made a hell of a mess of things and drank all of my v8?

headed to maine in a few days i guess and then out to the blessed cape cod!

back in asheville after a week of riding the rails. asheville --> knoxville --> chattanooga -->atlanta --> greenwood, sc.  it was supposed to be a complete loop but after our ride from atlanta to greenwood took 16 effing hours we decided to bail on the next part of the trip which was a promised 12 hours [and probably would have turned into 24].   riding freight trains is one of the most fantastic feelings ever. im itching to jump on another today [living directly behind the yard doesnt help much] just because i can.  
highlights include a kitten, the amazing yard workers as helpful as ever, the awesome conductor who put us on the unit from chattanooga to atlanta, greg the bus driver who came looking for us after we had asked him for directions five hours earlier and drove us up lookout mountain [which im pretty sure would have been the death of me] to the csx yard, sex on the highline, the nice officer who drove us to the county line after we bailed in greenwood and had the entire police force called on us for being ""two black males in camo and ski masks"", and ""kaia"" the hippie who picked us up en route to asheville and smoked us out for the first time in ages.  
lowlights of course would be having the police called on us in greenwood, my stupid ass trying to exchange two crummy tomatoes for two nice ones at the grocery store and then having the cops called on us for ""scamming"" the grocery store for TWO goddamned tomatoes, losing my super fancy headlamp, unrideable train after unrideable train in chattanooga and thinking i would never make it out of that  town, the ride from atlanta to greenwood which included a completely random 7 hour stop in the middle of nowhere and maybe the lovely mix of mosquito bites and poison ivy that is covering severely large parts of my body.

should be in pittsburgh by the end of the week if all goes according to plan. pittsburgh [hey y'all!] --> philly --> ocean city, md --> providence --> cape cod --> nyc [ahem heather!!!] --> boston  and then headed out for sugar beet harvesting come september in minnesota!

im here in the university of tennessee's reference library and maybe youre thinking i should be readin' instead of sitting here writing this nonsense but that aint what im a thinkin.

southern accents are hilarious as fried chicken is plenty.

The drive across the country was smooth as ice. our first day we did a little over 750 miles from taos through Amarillo and Oklahoma City.  We slept in some bushes along a dirt road that night and continued on and were in little rock for Memorial Day celebrations.  After a brief impromptu tour of the Old State House [we were really just looking for a bathroom] we headed out. Soon out of Little Rock we realized that driving the distance we were undertaking on Memorial Day is REALLY asking for it.  Memphis was made by the noon hour which took us to Beale Street.  Beale reminds me of Bourbon st in many ways, tacky souvenir shops and tourists in fanny packs and kahki shorts.  Sun Records is not even in this section of clean cobblestone and fabricated fun, but a few blocks down in a much more ""real"" neighborhood.  
We headed for graceland via the Stax record museum [unfortunatly we couldnt find the museum as i was distracted by prostitutes] and hit up the AMVETs thrift store which was oddly open on Memorial Day.  Did i honestly think i was going to find some sweet vintage vinyl in a thrift store on the road to Graceland? [I did find a cool members only jacket however]. After Graceland we went on a failed misson for fried chicken [but caught the prostitute getting into someones car] and headed for Knoxville. 
The Brown Recluse hung out in the car somewhere [im assuming] and was nice and quiet for the trip across the country.  I hope he decides to leave sometime soon. He may have already left but i will never know, for years, i will never know if there is or isnt a Brown Recluse living in my car. 

Now that ive got the creeps again, ill move on. Knoxville has been fun so far! The entire city is rideable by bike and quite charming so far.  The day before yesterday i was given a spur of the moment bike tour of the city by some complete stranger and yesterday another complete stranger professed his love for me the parking lot of a drugstore while it was raining. HAH. 

I am, however headed for the mountains come Monday. I plan on hanging out there for the month and doing a little environmental action. Plans after that include heading to Cape Cod come July 1st and hopefully hanging out in Pittsburgh in between.

my time in taos has come to an abrupt end. just when i felt like i was getting into the groove here im uprooting myself and heading east.  Im not sure if i will return here but i feel as though some day i may.  Living in the enchanted circle has been nothing short of enchanting.  I work on an organic farm, for a sustainable development group and have this other crummy job at a gym which gives me access to outdoor pools and hot tubs.  i was just offered a job at a super cool cafe in town and am starting to hang out with some cool cats here and there.  leaving on a positive note is a good thing i guess.

knoxville will bring me bike trips, train trips [trains in general], old friends, whiskey and spray paint, industrial waste! and eventually it should bring me to the wonderful atlantic ocean. 
i guess the plan is to just see where it takes me.  if nothing else i am definitely riding my bike to the ocean and back. no joking about that.

driving on 40 will be interesting. ive never been anywhere near any of this part of the country and we are headed directly through Amarillo, Oklahoma City, Little Rock and Memphis!!! should be quite an adventure and my traveling partner seems like he will be a good one to have along.  

its about 92 degrees out here on the mesa today. 92 and clear! its been like this for most of the week and should only get hotter!  i am off to finish up some group tour and will be riding my bike along the rim of the rio grande tonight.

seriously, the wind out here is on average 20-30mph. while its hot and sunny most days the wind just makes it unbearable to be outside. 

i got a job at the local organic CSA which is really fucking cool so far. it also seems to be the place where the white rastafarian women work.  its quite interesting to look out into the field and see everyone in headwraps and long dresses working harrrrd. there is a LOT of work to be done as the rains have kept the fields too wet for planting.  we are slowly catching up [yesterday we filled 850 gallon planters] to the timeline but with there being a maximum of five people working at any time its not moving fast enough. 
these women are a total trip, if i hear ""oh my jah"" one more time ill just burst out laughing. 

over the weekend i let this architect from holland crash at the house. hes really into floating communities and sustainable architecture so we did a bit of touring around the community and whatnot. he was ok, and i thought i would enjoy having someone around but soon after he arrived i realized how much i am enjoying my private space.

i rode my  bike to the town of Tres Piedras today which is about 20 miles from my current residence. The ride out was fairly leisurely although a gradual climb as i was rising from about 7000 ft elevation to 8500 ft. Part of the reason for me to want to visit this choice little number is just telling people, ""oh im riding my bike to Tres Piedras."" it just flows off your tongue so beautifully. Upon arriving to this lovely town i quickly discovered it is but a blinking light intersection between US 64 and US 522.  Another interesting note is the ratio of broken down cars to actual people which is a huge one. I climbed some barbed wire to investigate a few of the many abandoned and disheveled homes. nothing really of interest here other than an awesome piece of graffiti that was simply ""REBELS RULE 4 EVER"" and a makeshift bunkbed assembled from tree limbs and rope. truly a beautiful piece of furniture. i hope this was the work of some hobos but im guessing it was hippies.
the ride home was a bitch! 40 mph headwinds that made it seem like i was moving along at a snails pace. towards the end i swore violently at any car that passed me within a 3 feet clearance of my bike. i cant understand some people who will not even move over a few feet for safety when passing a cyclist. 

its been raining and snowing here for the past week which has led to no work for me, which is a good thing since im settling into my new abode for the final stretch of my stay here in taos.

last night i made an attempt to go out to listen to a ""ska"" band who was traveling through town. they did sublime covers. i think that says it all. 

the spiral jetty has reemerged from the depths of the great salt lake and i am a mere state away but cannot afford to visit it at the moment and probably wont be able to ever during my time here.

i have just consumed not one but two baked potatoes and will relocate to the couch where i plan on parking it for the rest of the night!"

my thumb and forefinger are both properly tore up.

OF COURSE i couldnt find the only pattern i needed to complete my toolbelt!

i cant imagine why he would want to hire me to work since im super shitty and know literally nothing about this stuff. today was the first day i had ever used a drill and im pretty sure i destroyed a screen that i had installed.

someone in the library has a really bad nasal problem and its quite disgusting to constantly hear him sniffing and blowing into his shirt.

seven years in the making.


ive been packing lots of mud into tires and learning to plaster walls with mudpack.  im working with the Greater World Community based out of taos [earthship.org] and am trying to get a handle on the general makeup of these fabulous sustainable dwellings.
ive decided to camp here for the summer or for however long i can stand it here. this choice has proven to be a difficult one in that it still goes down to the 'teens at night. ive found a pretty cool spot right on the rim of the rio grande in the middle of the mesa but i cant keep my tent up during the day so im forced to pack in and pack out every night which is a bit annoying. the inability for any sort of shelter stability is driving me crazy but hopefully that will change once im more of an official volunteer here.

taos is pretty crazy. loads of hippies and weirdos. land is really cheap out here so this whole hippie shanty town has popped up ""across the street"" from the Greater World.  [across the street being 10 miles away but generally across the highway]. its pretty crazy living from what ive heard thus far.

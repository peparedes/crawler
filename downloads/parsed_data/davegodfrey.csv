"event","Its been a slow day at work, so I've been watching the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2013/feb/05/gay-marriage-debate-politics-live-blog?commentpage=1"">Grauniad's</a> feed of the debate in the House of Commons. Mainly because I heard Charles Moore on the Today programme being mind-bogglingly stupid, and I had to check that he wasn't just a complete idiot they'd dragged off the street, and those opposing the bill actually had some sensible reasons for opposing the bill.<br /><br />Apparently for Charles marriage is all about shagging and having kids. So anyone who can't have kids, or doesn't want them shouldn't be married. Nor should people who don't like sex be allowed to get married. Except they should because it would be &quot;open to the possibility&quot;, but same-sex marriage isn't. Unless of course the woman has had a hysterectomy, so that argument doesn't work either. I do see his point that marriage these days may be more about the wedding than the actual relationship. But that says far more about the willingness of individuals to enter into agreements without due consideration than it does about what shape genitals they have. In which case Las Vegas has probably done more to harm the institution of marriage than the homosexuals will.<br /><br />So far I've been disappointed.<div style=""margin-left: 40px;""><br />&quot;Sir Tony Gale: There is a way forward.  It has been suggested but it has been ignored. I do not subscribe to it  myself but I recognise the merit in the argument, and that is this; if  the government is serious about this, take it away, abolish the civil partnerships bill, abolish civil marriage, and create a civil union bill  that applies to all people, irrespective of their sexuality or their  relationships, and that means brother and brothers, sisters and sisters  and brothers and sisters as well. That would be a way forward. This is not.&quot;</div><div><br />I've thought for a long time that it would be a good idea for some  sort of civil union that allows two people in a mutually caring  relationship to form some sort of legal partnership, so that, for instance, they  can defer paying inheritance tax, so one doesn't lose the house they  were living in when the other dies, such as in the recent case of the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/apr/30/inheritancetax.tax"">two unmarried sisters</a> who lost their appeal to the European Court.  Should they be exempt from inheritance tax? Perhaps not, but I see no  reason why, as long-term mutual dependents, they shouldn't be able to defer  payment.&quot;The absence of ... a legally binding agreement between the  applicants renders their relationship of cohabitation, despite its long  duration, fundamentally different to that of a married or civil  partnership couple,&quot; I am not aware of any legally binding agreement the  two women could have entered into.</div><br />Sadly I suspect this is not what Sir Tony had in mind.<br /><br /><div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">&quot;Craig Whittaker, a Conservative, said it would be  better for the government to create a new category of marriage called  state marriage. That could replace civil partnerships, and it would  allow gay people to be married without undermining religious marriage&quot;</div><br />Given that the CofE and the Anglican Church in Wales are expressly forbidden  from marrying same sex couples and no religious institution or minister  has to marry a same-sex couple if they don't want to, then I'd say  that's not far off what we've got. We just haven't given them the same names.  Alternatively, perhaps we should have state and religious marriages, and  only state ones confer the legal benefits. Allegedly this is the situation in France. Again, I don't quite think  that's what he was getting at.<br /><br />Nadine Dorries continues to be an utterly vile and completely clueless individual.<br /><br /><div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">&quot;This bill in no way makes a requirement of faithfulness from  same-sex couples. In fact, it does the opposite. In a heterosexual  marriage a couple can divorce for adultery, and adultery is if you have sex with a member of the opposite sex. In a heterosexual marriage a  couple vow to forsake all others ... A gay couple have no obligation to make that vow because they do not have to forsake all others because they cannot divorce for adultery. There is no requirement of faithfulness. And if there is no requirement of faithfulness, what is a marriage? &quot;</div><br />I'm pretty sure a heterosexual couple don't have to vow to forsake all others if they don't want to. Plenty of people are in open marriages, and of course because adultery is defined as having sex with a member of the opposite sex that you aren't married to you can't sue for  divorce on the grounds of adultery if your husband leaves you for another man. So its a pretty restrictive requirement of faithfulness, even if only the straights can get married isn't it? Of course most sensible people would be suing on the grounds  of unreasonable behaviour. But then Mad Nad hasn't made a career out of being sensible. I was hoping that someone would have tabled an amendment to redefine adultery so that it does apply to people sleeping  with members of the same sex, which would handily shut these people up, but that doesn't seem to have happened.<br /><br /><div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">&quot;Stewart Jackson, the Conservative MP for Peterborough,  said he was opposed to the bill. And he said he objected to David Lammy  implying that those opposed to gay marriage were similar to those who  opposed civil rights for blacks in America in the 1950s.&quot;</div><br />Poor little mite. Did the nasty opposition MP&nbsp;hurt your feelings? Tough. Because the people who are opposing this bill <em>are</em> similar to those who opposed the Civil Rights movement. Specifically the ones who wanted to keep the miscegenation laws.<br /><br /><div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">&quot;David Burrowes, the Conservative MP for Enfield  Southgate, said the bill was about redefining marriage. It was a  redefinition that downgraded marriage, he said.<br /> He said he had been subject to death threats because of his stance on  this. MPs who oppose the bill have been called homophobes, Nazis or  bigots, he said.&quot;</div><br />I deplore the death threats, but the description of MPs opposing the bill as homophobes and bigots is perfectly accurate. Also, I'm pretty sure we started downgrading marriage when we allowed people to get divorced, stopped putting people to death for adultery, stopped thinking of women as property, that sort of thing. <div style=""margin-left: 40px;""><br />&quot;Matthew Offord, the Conservative MP for Hendon, said all previous attempts to allow gay marriage have led to marriage being defined. He suggested that this could lead to marriage being redefined to include polygamy. In the Netherlands three-way relationships were now acknowledged under cohabitation agreements, he said.&quot;<br />&nbsp;</div>And what's so bad about that pray Matthew?<br />"

"event","Other than the first one, (in March 2009) where I discussed the deeply awesome <a href=""davegodfrey.dreamwidth.org/70200.html"">Dorothy Hodgkin</a>, I've utterly failed to do anything about Ada Lovelace Day. Mostly because at least initially it tended towards the technology, engineering, and computing side, and I'm a blue-skies scientist type.

When I was growing up there were two people presenting programmes about astronomy on the TV (somehow I managed to miss out on Carl Sagan)- Patrick Moore, and Heather Couper.

So I'd like to raise a glass to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolin_Crawford"">Carolin Crawford</a>. Gresham Professor of Astronomy, (a post Heather Couper once held) and a regular on the BBC's <i>In Our Time</i>, which you can download for free.

"event","So, <i>Dredd</i>. Was not dreadful. Which, given its much (and by and large justifiably) maligned predecessor was all I was hoping for when I heard about it. If its basically the same film and Karl Urban is humble enough, and familiar enough with the source material not to show his face, then that would have been good enough for me.

However, having read feedback by 2000AD fans I was expecting something very good. It did not disappoint. Is it better than <i>The Avengers</i>? Its a lot less fun, certainly. But then living in MegaCity One is not supposed to be fun. Being Iron Man is clearly supposed to be fun, hell even being the Hulk isn't too bad. However no-one really wants to be Judge Dredd, and anyone who does, probably shouldn't be allowed anything sharper than a spoon. It's a pretty humourless film (there aren't even any <i>District 9</i>-esque death-by-cow moments to lighten the mood), but its not po-faced. It isn't funny, because life in a city of 800 million people in an area about the size of Scotland on the edge of complete anarchy isn't going to be ""funny"".

Its a much smaller film than its predecessor. We don't see the Cursed Earth other than in brief shots topping and tailing the film. As I haven't seen <i>The Raid</i> don't want to draw too many comparisons, but the plot is largely the same- I'd also compare it to <i>Die Hard</i> for obvious reasons. I definitely missed the sale that the Stallone version went for- but as with so many comic book adaptations that haven't worked it tried to cram too much in. In <i>Judge Dredd</i>, the Angel Gang, ABC warriors, and Dredd's origins, are all picked up, toyed with, and dispensed with after five minutes or so. It gives you the feeling of a large world, but everything's disjointed and spread thinly. <i>Dredd</i> doesn't even try this. We get the feeling of a wider world, but its very self-contained- almost too self contained. I'm sure there are a fair few shout-outs that the 2000AD readers will pick up on, but are lost on me. And I don't honestly mind. It feels like a short, one-shot story, rather than a story arc. And I have no problem with that, whatsoever. Its certainly preferable to watching it done badly. If this is the start of a franchise, or given what HBO has shown you can do with TV series, essentially a pilot with a cinema release, then I'll be more than happy.

The acting is definitely better- when Karl Urban says that he is the law he's asserting control. Stallone was whining like a petulant child. He's also got a much more expressive chin than Sly, which helps, because he doesn't take his helmet off. Those of us who have seen <i>Game of Thrones</i> know that Lena Headley can do scheming very well, and in a contest between Cersei Lannister and Madeline ""Ma-Ma"" Madrigal, I honestly don't know who would win. Olivia Thirlby as Anderson gets lots to do, at no point does she seem like a damsel in distress, which more than most women in action films get. 

I want to describe it as beautiful but I can't. Because its ugly, dirty and noisy. Just like MegaCity One is supposed to be. MegaCity One in the Stallone version wasn't spotless, but it didn't look much worse than many cities today. This MegaCity? It really is a dystopian hell-hole.

The SloMo scenes are very well shot, and work well in 3D, with one or two exceptions, where it really looks like the front of the scene is a 2D shot pasted in front of a backdrop, like those paper model theatres. However this is the first film I've seen in 3D (there's only two places in London that are showing it in Glorious Two Dimensions) so I honestly don't know if that's a criticism of the 3D-ing in this particular film, or a problem with 3D in general.

There's a completely callous disregard for human life, and a civilian bodycount probably in the hundreds- something, again, completely absent in Stallone's version. I hope it does well, because not only does it mean we'll get sequels (and they've hinted they'd like to do the Dark Judges, or Judge Tyrannosaurus, which could be really good), but it shows there's a market for properly dystopian sci-fi, which I've always had a soft spot for, ever since <i>Robocop</i>. 

Thinking about how well the team handled this very massive, deep, and rather British dystopian future, I'd like to see what they can do with that other vast and complex crapsack world, we created- Warhammer 40K.

So yeah, I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you haven't seen it, do so."

Rarely has the &quot;can we make maths pink?&quot; joke felt more like reality.<br /><br />If you want to inspire women to be scientists tell them the story of <a href=""http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_rubin.html"">Vera Rubin</a>, who had to meet her prospective PhD supervisors in the departmental lobby because women weren't allowed inside the offices, and provided the evidence what convinced people that Dark Matter exists.<br /><br />How about Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, who showed that the sun was made of hydrogen, and said:<br /><br /><div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">&quot;The reward of the young scientist is the emotional thrill of being the  first person in the history of the world to see something or to  understand something. ... The  reward of the old scientist is the sense of having seen a vague sketch  grow into a masterly landscape.&quot;</div><br />You want inspirational women scientists- Caroline Herschel, sister of the more famous William (who discovered Uranus), was a first-rate astronomer, and was the first woman awarded the Royal Astronomical Society's Gold Medal (the second? Vera Rubin). Or Margaret Burbidge, coauthor of the  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B2FH"" title=""B2FH"" class=""mw-redirect"">B<sup>2</sup>FH</a> theory, that still explains how the elements up to iron are made, and is an ardent feminist who turned down the Annie Jump Cannon (another female astronomer) Prize because it was only given to women.<br /><br />And that's just four of the astronomers I could name off the top of my head.

"event","I've written about Brewdog before- they make rather nice beers, many of which are ridiculously strong, and don't particularly appeal to me for that reason- but they're a good example of the kind of craft brewery that's been thriving, and have very definitely got their marketing strategy right. Grab headlines with limited edition runs of &quot;the world's strongest beer&quot; (well, its really a freeze-distilled spirit, but who's counting), and back this up with a range of rather more sensible quality beers. Good for them. They've recently opened a <a href=""http://www.brewdog.com/bars/camden"">bar down in Camden</a>, and very nice it is too- it sells pretty much the whole of their range, and I ought to visit again.<br /><br />As a relatively small concern with a handful of pubs you wouldn't think that the big pubco's would be that scared of them would you? After all, Diageo make Guinness which sells something like 1.5 <em>billion</em> pints a year worldwide. Brewdog's total output is about six hundred times less. They own seven pubs. Diageo own, well probably none actually, I don't think they have a subsidiary pubco, although I'm sure they used to- but then again they don't need to- their products are available in almost every bar in the UK. Talisker, Gordon's, Pimm's, Jose Cuervo, they have their fingers in a lot of pies.<br /><br />So do they <em>really</em> have anything to fear from Brewdog? Really?<br /><br />Seems like they do. At the British Institute of Innkeeping Scotland Awards, Brewdog had heard through the grapevine, that they might do rather well in a particular category.- Bar Operator of the Year- voted for by an independent panel. Sadly they didn't win. Oh well, these things happen, better luck next time and all that..<br /><br />However, the winners refused to accept the award. Because someone had already engraved &quot;Brewdog&quot; on it.<br /><br />Um...<br /><br />Turns out that some Diageo reps strongarmed the BII into changing the winner at the last minute, stating that they'd refuse to sponsor the awards ever again if Brewdog won.<br /><br />You may as well go <a href=""http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article/diageo-v-brewdog"">here and read Brewdog's account</a> of the evening, and the aftermath. I don't have much more to add other than &quot;Jesus Christ!&quot;<br /><br />I'm not sure what explanation there is for Diageo's admitted &quot;serious misjudgement&quot;. I don't know what was being served at the dinner, but not even Brewdog advise drinking a bottle of Tactical Nuclear Penguin in one go.<br /><br />"

"event","Finally made it, after repeatedly kicking myself for missing it year after year, missing bands I still want to see, like Sonata Arctica, Children of Bodom, Korpiklaani, Carcass, Moonspell, Turisas, Iced Earth, Alestorm, and so on...<br /><br />And it was worth it. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Day 1..."">Wolves, Poisonblack, some Canadian chappie, a Furious Horde, and a Wild&nbsp;Child<br /><br />Wolf are an awful lot of fun. German Heavy Metal doing exactly what it says on the tin.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""166""/><br /><br />Poison Black are one of those bands I've wanted to see for a while, after the break-up of Sentenced, and the death of the guitarist preventing any possibility of a reunion, its the only chance I'll get to see something approaching them live. And they were definitely worth waiting for, even if the lead singer was recovering from a knee op and had to sit down for the entire gig. Nevermind. Apparently they'll be on tour sometime soon, as they have a new album to plug. Also they brought pretty much the only rain that day. Which seemed appropriate.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""167""/><br /><br />The Furious Horde appeared on the New Blood Stage, and are very, very, very good. I'll definitely have to get to one of their shows sometime soon.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""168""/><br /><br />Devin Townsend is by turns deeply silly (&quot;Ziltoid&quot;), ludicrously prolific (he's just released four new albums under the &quot;Devin Townsend Project&quot;), lots of fun on stage, and writes brilliant songs.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""169""/><br /><br />I don't think I need to say anything about Wasp other than <i>they're fucking Wasp!!!</i><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""170""/></lj-cut><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Day 2..."">Trolls, corpsepaint, Christopher Lee, and a band with more singers than instruments<br /><br />Finntroll win the prize for most entertaining band of the festival, hands down. Purely because of the audience. Silly dancing, conga lines, horns, large men in tiny little posing pouches. Next time they play I'll be down there.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""171""/><br /><br />Ihsahn I really liked. I've never been a huge black metal fan, but I have liked Emperor, and the more noodly gaze-at-your-shoes stuff that some bands have got in there. Not convinced it worked so well on a sunny afternoon in August, but you just know that if My Dying Bride played again they'd have exactly the same problem too.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""172""/><br /><br />Wintersun have been mocked somewhat because they still haven't finished the new album. They pulled out of last year's Bloodstock to finish work on it, and still haven't. Still the new track they played was great, so maybe it'll be finished next year.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""173""/><br /><br />Therion win the prize for &quot;most people on stage at one time&quot; because they have four singers.  They'd have had more if they could bring the choir along.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""174""/><br /><br />Rhapsody of Fire haven't played the UK before. And I hadn't heard anything they'd done before either. They are however purveyors of the finest cheese. They came on to Christopher Lee, sing songs about swords and dragons. What's not to like?<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""175""/><br /><br />I legged it out of Rhapsody in time to see the last few songs from AngelWitch's NWOBM&nbsp;based goodness. I'm pretty sure I was born 15 years too late.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""176""/><br /><br />Immortal, whilst being very good, do seem to recognise that despite being a genre-defining band they should clearly have fun on stage, Abbath bouncing up and down on the monitor getting the crowd to make &quot;woah&quot; noises of varying pitch depending on how high he stood up and waved his arms is an image that will stay with me a long time.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""177""/></lj-cut><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Day 3..."">Hammers, Hell, punks and all the aces.<br /><br />Hell have finally got their first album out, despite being around for donkey's years, disappearing off the face of the planet and reforming. They sound a lot like Mercyful Fate fronted by Arthur Brown. Which is a very good thing if you ask me.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""178""/><br /><br />Primordial should get the prize of heroes of the festival were it not for the fact that the aforementioned Furious Horde, and Josiah's partner Jane lived up to their name during the night and nabbed some grotty little herbert who'd jumped over the fence to nick stuff during the night. Apparently he'd been been in on the first night too. Its a perennial problem that Bloodstock (and probably most other festivals too) has. It does rather change one's mind about the replica Berlin Wall that Michael Eavis puts up each year for Glastonbury.<br /><br />But anyway Primordial started brilliantly, and then the lead singer's voice went completely. But they kept going, and definitely won the audience over. They reminded me a lot of Geasa, although they've been around much longer, but I'm a big fan of their Celtic death metal sound.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""179""/><br /><br />Nemhain filled my need for punk. And also confirmed (if it were necessary) that the most attractive women in the world all play bass. (Yes, I am that shallow). Covers of The Gits &quot;Second Skin&quot;, and the Misfits &quot;Die Die My Darling&quot;. They've also got a bloody good drummer in Adrian Erlandsson, who gets to play twice as he's in At The Gates too.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""180""/><br /><br />Hammerfall are one of those bands that you think are either very silly, amazing, or both at the same time. As with Rhapsody and Therion I can't help but grin like an idiot when they're on stage. Its <em>just too much fun</em>. I mean they made a video with the Swedish Women's Curling Team. How much more metal can you get?<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""181""/><br /><br />I sat on the grass for At The Gates (as I did for Kreator and Exodus), I'm clearly getting too old for this 3 day festival thing, as I needed a kip during Morbid Angel (who, from listening in the tent appear to use <i>lots</i> of tram bell.<br /><br />And that just leaves Motorhead. Who were, well, Motorhead. I haven't heard much that they've done since about 1987, but they played lots of their more rock'n'roll tracks, and then stopped with Ace of Spades, and no encore as they may have had some &quot;technical difficulties&quot;.

"event","I think <a href=""http://www.twitvid.com/4JTZH"">this remarkable woman</a> nails pretty much everything I have to say about the riots in London. (Click on the link for the video LJ doesn't want to embed it I'm afraid).

The Met Police and the IPCC clearly could have handled relations with the family of Mark Duggan much better. They have every right to feel upset, angry, and to demand answers. You'd have thought that the Met should have learnt that lesson after the Jean Charles De Menezes clusterfuck. Burning down your neighbour's livelihood and home and looting a friend's workplace doesn't solve anything. It only makes things worse.

Equally however I want to understand why all these people are rioting and looting. And I think Hannah Nicklin <a href=""http://www.hannahnicklin.com/2011/08/i-can-understand-them/"">pretty much nails it in this post</a>.

"event","I have two fishtanks. One's a big community one with interesting subtropicals like the very personable <a href=""http://www.loaches.com/species-index/weather-loach-misgurnis-anguillicaudatus"">Weather Loach</a> (<i>Misgurnus anguillicaudatus</i>, the very pretty <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Cloud_Mountain_minnow"">White Cloud Mountain Minnows</a> (<i>Tanichthys albonubes</i>) and the mildly psychotic <a href=""http://www.seriouslyfish.com/profile.php?genus=Jordanella&amp;species=floridae&amp;id=199"">American-Flag Fish</a> (<i>Jordanella floridae</i>).

I also have a smaller 40cm cube with more red cherry shrimp than the mind can comfortably entertain. There's also a small group of the utterly stunning <a href=""http://www.tropicalfishfinder.co.uk/article_detail.asp?id=16"">Pacific Blue Eye</a> (<i>Pseudomugil gertrudae</i>). Sadly the blue-eyes haven't done terribly well, from having 8 I'm now down to four, and while I've seen the males sparring with each other and flashing their fins at the females I've seen no sign of spawning. I think they'd probably do better in a larger group and with a bigger tank. I've decided not to replace the ones I have when they shuffle off this mortal coil- I've had something like 18 Rosy Bitterlings in the past year, and I'm down to my last female. If I can't keep the fish alive I think its best not to try until I have rather more experience. Besides as a beginner with a first aquarium, trying to keep a fish that breeds in Swan Mussels (which are renowned as impossible to keep alive) was perhaps rather too ambitious, though I did see lots of mating dances and one somewhat abortive spawning, so I was well pleased with the result. I'll definitely come back to the Blue-Eyes. 

So I added three <a href=""http://www.fishbase.org/summary/speciessummary.php?id=3224"">Least Killifish</a> (<i>Heterandria formosa</i> one of which promptly died during quarantine, and a second jumped out the tank. Today I've seen two babies! There's no sign of mother however- she may well be hiding in the foliage (its rather densely planted), although both babies were relatively large, so they may have been in the tank for some time.

I think I shall have to track down a few more- unfortunately they seem rather thin on the ground only one place in London seems to have them, while others have stocked them they only crop up in small batches, and ""when they're gone, they're gone""."

"event","Heartily sick of that sidebar with all those sponsored ads that even AdBlock won't get rid of? I think I've found a solution.

A Greasemonkey script called <a href=""http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/93039"">""Remove Facebook Right Column""</a>. Which does exactly what it says on the tin. Gets rid of the ""people you might know"" section, which, frankly I never used as it cluttered up the screen with people I didn't actually know at all.

And at the same time I found <a href=""http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/74663"">""Facebook Fixed Header""</a> and <a href=""http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/75678"">""Older posts bar always on bottom""</a> which together do something you'd have though FB would have put in from the start wouldn't you? After all if you're at the bottom of the timeline chances are you might want to extend it, rather than hovering about trying to get the thing to pop up. And why have a header with a search bar, and all the other tools disappear off the top that can be so far up?

LJ does this too. Why? Surely we've moved past the days when frames in websites were loathed so universally?"

"event","Given that there's a new one, and the price of the old one has dropped a bit on the second hand market I've decided to get a used <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_5D"">Canon EOS 5D</a>. Its a full-frame camera, so all my lenses do what they did on the old <a href=""http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camera/film/data/1986-1990/1989_eos1.html"">EOS-1</a> film body I have, rather than having a 1.6 crop as on the cheaper bodies. Also it won't be killed by the voltages from the flash kit I own too. It'll only work manually, but given the instant feedback that digital gives you that's not something I'm too unhappy about. I'll probably look out for a dedicated flashgun eventually, (and it looks like some of the modern flashguns will still work on a T90, which is a real bonus) but for now its all good, as they say.<br /><br />I also finally found a hotshoe adaptor so I can use the long flash cable I have. Which is <i>very</i> useful, as you can see...<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: left;""><a href=""http://th02.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2011/008/2/3/23dd68e81f9487988ac8ca4010536618-d36ptq2.jpg""><img alt="""" style=""width: 700px; height: 516px;"" ljaddtriggersobjectstatus=""mouseout"" src=""http://th02.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2011/008/2/3/23dd68e81f9487988ac8ca4010536618-d36ptq2.jpg"" /></a></div><br />Now the only thing I need to look out for is <a href=""http://www.srb-griturn.com/canon-eos-to-canon-fd-bellows-adaptor-92-p.asp"">one of </a><a href=""http://www.srb-griturn.com/canon-eos-to-canon-fd-bellows-adaptor-92-p.asp"" herf=""http://www.srb-griturn.com/canon-eos-to-canon-fd-bellows-adaptor-92-p.asp"">these</a>, an EOS to FD adaptor, without glass, so I can use bellows and <a href=""http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/canon/fdresources/fdlenses/fdmacro/2035macro.htm"">fancy close-up lenses</a>. Knowing there and then if the lighting or focussing are right is really helpful. Much as I'd love one, I just can't afford the <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-MPE6528-MP-E65mm-Macro-Lens/dp/B0000C4GAN/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1294524498&amp;sr=8-1"">MP-E65</a>.<br /><br />So am I abandoning film? Hell no. I'll still use it for lots of things- especially situations where I know what I'm doing with regards to lighting, etc. Plus I love the feel of the old cameras. I think the <a href=""http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camera/film/data/1966-1975/1971_f1.html"">F-1</a> might see rather more use compared to the <a href=""http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camera/film/data/1986-1990/1986_t90.html"">T90</a> now. With digital I shoot more, but think less. Which doesn't necessarily make for better photographs. With film I pay much more attention to what I'm seeing in the viewfinder.<br /><br />But when it comes to experimentation?

"event","I am a massive fan of speculative zoology. I adore the whole ""what if the dinosaurs hadn't died  out"" ideas, and like many people of my generation I owned lots of books about dinosaurs many of which were written by <a href=""http://www.dougal-dixon.co.uk/"">Dougal Dixon</a>. Who, back in 1981 wrote ""After Man: A Zoology of the Future"". He also subsequently wrote ""Man After Man"", which is essentially full on Sci-Fi, though I have to say that Nemo Ramjet did the whole ""the next 500 million years of human evolution"" thing better in <a hre=""http://sivatherium.narod.ru/library/Ramjet/01_en.htm"">All Our Tomorrows""</a> (seriously, read it, its freaking awesome, if not a <i>little</i> nightmarish in places). In 1988 ""The New Dinosaurs"", which I read before Jurassic Park came out. Sadly this is the one that doesn't stand up that well to the massive amount of stuff we've learnt about maniraptorans and the like since then. <a href=""http://www.unet.univie.ac.at/~a0000265/Spec/index.html"">Specworld</a> is a very good modern version.

But its After Man, which was the first, and I think still the best. Not all of the future animals are particularly practical- I agree with <a href=""http://babbletrish.blogspot.com/search/label/Dougal%20Dixon"">Tricia</a> that tusks on a mole are just dumb. but the hypercarnivorous rats are a masterstroke.

But I mostly want to point out that Japan seems to have gone completely nuts for him. There was an hour-long program (sometime in the '80s by the looks of it) with some rather lovely stop-motion animals. I think it also talks a lot about other aspects of evolution, but I don't speak Japanese, so I have no idea exactly what they're talking about, but there's shots of the Galapagos and that kind of thing.

<lj-embed id=""80""/>

And if that wasn't enough, someone made a cartoon sequence with all these animals in it. Which would be perfectly sane if that happy dancing bipedal baboon wasn't supposed to be the size of a <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>

<lj-embed id=""81""/>

But what I most want is <a href=""http://www.geocities.co.jp/Technopolis/9540/aftermancollect.html"">this</a> the ""After Man"" model kit. (It looks like there was more than one ""After Man"" cartoon based on that too. And yes, the Nightstalker, a flightless, blind, bipedal, killer bat, from Hawaii, really was supposed to be five feet tall. Call Roger Corman, I've got an idea for a film..."

"event","<P><FONT size=2>haha. i had a three day weekend. sux for you guys! well, actually it sucked for me but o well. on friday, i had to stay home b/c my sister was sick and we were signing all contracts that day for the houses and my parents were really busy so they couldnt watch her but we have to watch her b/c she has asthma and we need to make sure that she's ok at all times, especially when she's sick. (&lt;--wow long sentence) My sister and i couldnt go in with my parents to sign the contracts so we stayed in the car. We had the dogs with us and we had boxes in the back so claustrophobia totally set in.lol. the thing that realllyyy sucked was the fact that it was raining so i couldnt open the windows. So there i am sitting in a really hot car with a sick percon and 2 dogs all stuffed into the front seat and the windows started to fog up b/c it was cold and wet outside. ugh totally sucked. So after a lil while we started to realize something that smalled like gas. I remembered that there was a gasoline tank in the back of the car but we coulnt reach it b/c of all the boxes. my sister got a huge headache but i dont remember most of our time in the car lol. i seriously think i got high ffrom the gas. The rest of the weekend we had people move in our boxes and furniture. We're still not really unpacked and our furniture looks like total shit in this beautiful house but its all good. My room is now partially a really bright blue and the painter wil start the purple tomarro. g2g buh byez xoxoxooxx.</FONT></P>"

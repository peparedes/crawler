"event","So just got done talking to all of my friends. Most had some pretty cool things to say. School was gay like always. What's new?! So yeah I found out what an awesome weekend Eugenia had with her boyfriend! I am so happy for her. Soon (I hope) It will be my turn to have an awesome weekend with a guy. But until then I will continue to dream! Can't wait to get a sophmore shirt for the spirit assembly!! Hot pink and Lime green. The two best colors in the world. If you like them, thank myself, Eugenia, Danielle K., and Brittany Fox. If you don't like them I have no idea what your talking about! lol well i have nothing else to say for now. LUV YA!!

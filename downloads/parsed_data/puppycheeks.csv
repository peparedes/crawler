I REALLY WANT TO SEE BIG FISH. Anyone willing to take me? OH GOOD. That's great, pick me up at 7 then? Okay, it's a date. Seriously though, I really want to see that movie. Does it not look absolutely fantabulous? I think so. Hey, it's Tim Burton, does it really matter what the movie is about? It'll be good anyway. He is so weird, I LOVE IT! Weird people turn me on.

"event","Okay, well, I just got around to getting out of bed, and I remembered a dream I had. It was really strange, and I am <u>NOT</u> making this up, so bare with me people.

   Sharon and I were outside of my house, sitting by the lake, and we were just looking at the sunset or something... (it was almost like we were on a date, <i>weird</i>) and all of a sudden, the sun started to cloud in, and it turned all black, and it's rays were blocked, so, it looked as if someone had poured a bucket of oil on it. Anyway, so, it is all clouded in, and Sharon is freaking out, because she thinks it is part of the Rapture... And if any of you guys aren't Christian, the Rapture is the end of time, the end of the earth, and life as we know it. According to ancient texts, it is apparently a catastrophic event, where the mountains tremble, and the sounds of trumpets echo through the hills, as god comes forth and releases the ""forgiven"" to heaven, and the others, are <i>left</i> behind. Quite scary actually, makes you wish you had gone to church last sunday, huh? Anyway, so, Sharon is so excited because she wants to go to heaven, and she is like, beside herself, but then, she realizes that it ISN'T the rapture, and for some reason we end up going to my room. Now, nothing too gross happened, just hear me out. So we are standing there, in the doorway to my room, and all of a sudden, I pull her to me, and we start kissing. And I don't mean like a ""peck,"" I mean full-blown passionate kissing. It was pretty strange, and then, I finally pull away, and I immediately say: ""I don't know why I did that..."" and then Sharon answered: ""It's okay, I'm glad you did..."" but that was the end of that, and we started kissing again. That is all of the dream that I remember, that's it, weird huh? Anyways, I'm done for today...

Peace, Love, And Passionate Kissing

Anyway, today was <i>""Senior Slave Day""</i> and yet, I didn't see any seniors, OR slaves... hmm, strange how that works. So, We also had to vote on homecoming queens and kings and such, which was not fun, seeing as I HATE voting for things like this. I seem to always choose people that I <i>know</i> won't win. So I'm sitting in Civics and checking out the list of people that I can vote for. I of course zoom right to my name to see if the bastards spelled it right, and of course, they didn't. It was spelled: <i>Dustin Mayberrie</i> I was like, THEY SPELLED MY NAME WRONG! Is it not in the school files? People need Ninth Grade English more than me,  I swear. Anywayems, So when I blurted that out, Brianna, (she's a popular girl, and also a cheerleader of course) said to me: ""Who cares if your name is spelled wrong, no one will vote for you anyway..."" I was just about to snap, I remembered what <a href=""http://www.how-charming.net"">Amanda</a> said to me a while back about not taking crap from anyone, and not letting them walk all over me. I was so pissed, and I was about to do something, and not just sit there like I always do. I guess I gave her a mean look (of course!) and she said: ""I was kiding Dustin, GOD! What do you have stuck up your ass!"" Pissed meh roff.... I hate perky people that think they are better than everyone else.

I got Amanda's letter today! WOO AND HOOPS! I was happy. Brightened my day.... ^-^ I was so excited I didn't even take my eyes off the damn thing until I got home. Yep, Okay, let's talk about Amanda... She's the best, the one and only, and all that crap. But, It gets ruined when people get into my Internet life, It's Annoying, and you know who you are... I am STILL mad about people doing that. And I won't cool off for a while. Give me my space people! Well, I am thoroughly worked up about it now.... Gotta calm down, not let it ruin my day, meh....

Okie Dokie! What to talk about now, since I'm trying to get it ALL out. OH! I remember, they started Drug testing... [laughs] I love to watch people getting busted. They deserve it. It's <i>""random""</i> they say, but they have been <i>""randomly""</i> testing oddly enough, ALL of the druggies... LOL, Random.... [laughs again] Yeah right, but I don't care, it doesn't bug me, because I don't take drugs, o.0; Not that it matters. hmm, what else, Oh, there is this Heather girl that I really liked, until I go to know her, Woe, She needs some parental guidance right therrr, She drinks and does buttloads of drugs. (and where are the parents?) Uh ugh, non of that going on. I don' like that. I got to know her, and I don't like her. Now she won't leave me alone. She talks to me all of the time in Biology, I'm like, I don' do drugs, no sex, sorry! next please... (once again, where is herr parents???) ""Ugh, kids these days. In my day, we didn't have drugs, we had books, and we walked fifteen miles to school! IN THE SNOW! With No Shoes!!!!!""

Well, anyway, I think I am done, and I know I didn't make sense, but oh well, I think you'll get over it... OR maybe you <i>won't</i>

"event","I am so sick, I have a bad cold, and I can't breathe out of my nose... I feel miserable... Anyway, I don't know why I am writing today, I feel sick, UBER sick.... I just feel like using the fabulo journal I recieved from my dearest friend amanda... Ugh, I am too sick... Really sick, I can't breathe. I am complaining I know, but tommorrow I should be feeling better. Well, lemme tell you a bit about my day before I accidentally die.

Well, I was in Band yesterday, Putting together my saxophone, and all of a sudden, I dropped it... I WAS MORTIFIED. I was like: ""OH MY SWEET BEGEEZUS!"" I was freaking out. I picked it up, and my band director was looking at me; I checked to see if any keys were bent, and all was good... Until I tried to tighten the screw on my headjoint, and it was COMPLETELY bent. It apparently fell and hit the ground right on the edge, and it bent the little screw that allows you to tighten it up. So, I was stuck not being able to move the screw, and it was all crimped and such... I was like, good lord, to the hospital again... (that's what I call the shop) I felt like a total goober sitting there in band not being able to play. And I felt bad, because it was MY fault.

So, today, Sharon was nice enough to let me use her pride and joy, and I am eternally grateful. [praises] Anyway, that was really boring to read I bet, Sooooo....

Anyway, Lets talk about charmed now.... The Season Premiere was last sunday and I thoroughly enjoyed it. ALL of the eppys have been like, themed since the begginning of Season 5. It's weird. Like: Mermaids, Super Heroes, Leprechauns, etc, etc. It is getting kind of annoying... And I'm afraid this season is kicking off with the same idea.............. MORE THEMES! Good lord people, get some new ideas! Anyways, that's it...

"event","Whoa, I have a LiveJournal. This is cool... But I fear I have already screwed it up miserably with it's atrocious name. Don't ask me why I named my journal ""puppy cheeks"" I just did. Andyways, I have nothing really too say, but the fact that I have to thank amanda once again for being her good beegeezus self. Thanks manda!"

"event","TO A PARTY, MOM. . .
* Please read all the way to the bottom and sign your
name *


I went to a party,
And remembered what you said.
You told me not to drink, Mom
So I had a sprite instead.

I felt proud of myself,
The way you said I would,
That I didn't drink and drive,
Though some friends said I should.

I made a healthy choice,
And your advice to me was right,
The party finally ended,
And the kids drove out of sight.

I got into my car,
Sure to get home in one piece,
I never knew what was coming, Mom
Something I expected least.

Now I'm lying on the pavement,
And I hear the policeman say,
The kid that caused this wreck was drunk, Mom,
his voice seems far away.

My own blood's all around me,
As I try hard not to cry.
I can hear the paramedic say,
This girl is going to die.

I'm sure the guy had no idea,
While he was flying high,
Because he chose to drink and drive,
Now I would have to die.

So why do people do it, Mom
Knowing that it ruins lives?
And now the pain is cutting me,
Like a hundred stabbing knives.

Tell sister not to be afraid, Mom
Tell daddy to be brave,
And when I go to heaven,
""Daddy's Girl"" is on my grave.

Someone should have taught him,
That it's wrong to drink and drive.
Maybe if his parents had,
I'd still be alive.

My breath is getting shorter, Mom
I'm getting really scared.
These are my final moments,
And I'm so unprepared.

I wish that you could hold me Mom,
As I lie here and die.
I wish that I could say, ""I love you, Mom!""
So I love you and good-bye.

Thanks for defending me and trying to understand my postion with that ""person""( i don't feel like naming them right now)They have made me feel like shit and blamed me for stuff that wasn't my fault. I shouldn't have been so nice and understanding to them for what they did to me. I need to get stronger.....for my own good. I put my trust and heart in ""their"" hands and they lost my trust and broke my heart,so i can't be with someone like that. It's not good for me.

He didn't respect me at all. If it swas me crying he would laugh. That's the kind of person he was. He was a complete pervert to. I don't even want to write some of the stuff he said to me. He he obviously could have cared less about me. His friends would have to tell me everything that he did behind my back. I guess ""what goes around comes around"". One night he goes online and starts cussing me out. I spent that whloe night crying. And the next day he calls and i ask him  why did you cuss me out last night and he says it wasnt me it was my cousin. I talked to his friends and they said he was on last night and it was to dibrately make me cry. The week before he text messaged me saying that he made out with a girl from camp. I was crying an that night i was at one of my bestfriend's amanda's birthday party. 10 mins later he calls me as if nothing happened abnd says it's a joke. I was so mad and should have dumped him right then and there but i was deciding to be nice and gave him a second chance. I talked to his cousin and he said he was never on his sn. Then i realized how could he have been,he doesn't have his password. Again another lie. So after all of his lying and all of his other shit i realized i can't be with him anymore.Also telling some one to go kill themselves itsn't funny. What would happen if someone took that seriously. What would you say to their friends and family. Not so funny now..rite? Now i'm friends with Darsh and Alex, who were Pat's friends but now hate him  for what he did to me. PAT YOUR 14 YEARS OLD, GET A LIFE.

I haven't seen them in awhile since they live in VA. I was looking at old pictures w/my Aunt Jane and it was so nice b/c i saw a picture of my grandpa who i never met and pictures of my grandma. There was also pictures of my cousin and i when we were younger. Which feels like ages, in the pictures everyone looked so young and then u realize that they were only&nbsp; taken about five years ago which was so long ago. Then in the morning Aunt Jane woke me up at 9:30 which isn't my time at all. Mag went into the city at 12:15. My Aunt Jane is all healthy-thank god, but now i pray for my Aunt Terry who has lime diesease and is sick. Well then the remaining people in the house went to Nathan's for lunch. Then Aunt Jane and i went shopping and i got a beautiful necklace. Taylor got his bike, which he got hurt on. The cut on his knee wasn't as bad as Duffy said it was apparentely. Dorris(Mrs. Duffy) drove Taylor home and he will be ok. So i hope he feels better too. O, i had a great time over there. It was nice watching T.V. w/ Meg and Jesse.

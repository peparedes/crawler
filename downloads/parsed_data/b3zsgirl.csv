If you plug it into an Ethernet port, it works fine.  So if you have been thinking about a second computer to just do some internet and light typing work, this is the machine for you.  I even have a DVD drive for it if you are willing to put it in yourself."

"event","The Cure concert last night was three hours of awesome.  I did not miss the keyboards at all.  It made everything a bit more driving and raw.  They did use a lot of cool guitar and bass effects to give some of the feel, and it really worked.  

Here's the set list:

Intro (Someone's Adagio For Strings)
Out Of This World - Bloodflowers
Want - Wild Mood Swings
Fascination Street - Disintegration (Made me want to play along.  This is my all time favorite one to play)
A Night Like This - Head On the Door (Lots of extra bass fills)
The End of the World - The Cure
Lovesong - Disintegration
A Boy I Never Knew - 13th(they said this is the only time they are playing this in the US)
Pictures Of You - Disintegration
Lullaby - Disintegration
Maybe Someday - Bloodflowers
From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea - Wish (I Love this song and never missed the keyboards)
The Perfect Boy - 13th
Kyoto Song - Head on the Door
Hot Hot Hot - Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me
The Only One - 13th
The Blood - Head on the Door(Spanish guitar, what is not to love here.)
Sleep When I'm Dead - 13th
Push - Head on the Door
How Beautiful You Are - Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me
In Between Days - Head on the Door
Just Like Heaven - Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me (The whole arena was singing this one)
A Letter To Elise - Wish
Us Or Them - The Cure (This was so angry and hard it surprised me)
One Hundred Years - Pornography
Bloodflowers - Bloodflowers

1st encore:
Plainsong - Disintegration
Disintegration - Disintegration

2nd encore:
Boys Don't Cry - Boys Don't Cry
Jumping Someone Else's Train - Boys Don't Cry
Grinding Halt - Three Imaginary Boys
10:15 Saturday Night - Boys Don't Cry/ Three Imaginary Boys
Killing An Arab - Boys Don't Cry

3rd encore:
A Forest - Seventeen Seconds

Yes people...three encores.  Oddly nothing off of Faith (Primary would have been sweet), or at least Caterpillar off of The Top

Robert played and sang amazing.  I am always amazed at the way he can make you feel like you are in the moment of the song.  The play list hit most of my all time favorites with the exception of ""Doing the Unstuck"".  They had been playing it up until last night, which is just my luck.  

I adored Porl's shoes.  He had these platform boots (possibly ankle high) with a 3""-4"" high hobnail heel that were just awesome.  They made him look 8 feet tall.  I wonder if his feet were hurting after 3 hours on them.  He also had about 15 guitars on stage of which I think he played at least 8.  Sometimes he even switched during a song in the middle of a riff.  It was amazing to watch.  I don't usually get into guitar, but the solos were amazing too.  I am so glad to see him back.  He was the guitarist during all of their most acclaimed albums.  It is not just him, but I think he pushes Robert and Simon harder when he is there.  I can't wait for the new album.  

I have a whole new list of songs I want to learn since the bass was turned up high enough to hear.  It showed how the bass line really carries their best songs.  Simon played a lot of extra fills that make me wish I had a recording so I could learn them too.  Also, the red and black Thunderbird he played was tight.  It makes me almost want one, but I know how heavy and unbalanced they are.  Like a need a 6th bass. Simon is also as hot today as he was the last time I saw him play, with skintight pants, motorcycle boots and jacket that turned into skin tight black tank. He and Porl both looked like they spent all their off-time in the gym. Yum!

Jason was tight behind the kit, but rather detached from the whole thing.  Timing perfect as usual, and beat perfect. Not much to say hear since you could barely see him and he really didn't reach beyond what should have been there.  Which considering that he was not around for over half of what they played last night, it was amazing in and of itself. He remains the best drummer they have ever had. 

The second encore reminded us all that they used to be a punk band.  The songs were all back from when they were a three piece.  With the extra guitar, they just rocked harder.  They did the full album version of ""A Forest"" with Porl walking away midway through and letting Simon and Robert finish it up.  They jammed on it a while finishing it up without the extra guitar as it was meant to be.   

All and all the fifth time to see them and I still would do it again."

"event","So today in monday three days i will have no more wisdom teeth i am getting all four taken out! i am freaked out about recovering because they are grown around the nerve and impacted. They are the second most expensive suergry you can have so that means it is going to suck and hurt! 
Did i mention instead of having ten days to recover i only have four. Because i got hired as a manager in Barto hall. Which is a good thing but i dont want to have to move in two and half days after getting wisdom teeth out. Oh well i geuss i am excited once i feel a ton better i have drugs to make the pain not hurt and it will be great. 

The scared part is defently being a manager and living with a roomate. i am excited becuase it is what i wanted is to eb a manager.

Over all life is good i had an end of the year frisbee party on saterday and nothing got broken and only a few people got drunk but over all a great time.

I thought i woudl update that i am doing okay and still alive and still doing well! 

HOpe life stays good and not stressful because of my job, classes, and the little thing called life!
 
Lots of Love,
Ashlee R. Conner"

"event","So yesterday i was very upset that i hadn't talked to cory at all which by the way isn't always that strange but he normaly would call me by the end of the day to tell me that work went well that he was home, or that he was heading over to Willie's last night nothing. i finnaly got a hold of him when i was getting ready for bed at like 10 he told me that he was going to have to call me back. probly around 11 when i was almost asleep he called me back to tell me that his dad wasnt' doing well. basicly COry had been at the hospitale since after work making sure that his dad was fine. he said it wasn't a heart attacke which is good but they didn't knwo what was wrong which was bad.  it makes me so sad and scared because cory is the type to try to do things alone and i am afriad that he is going to push himself aqay from me becuase of his dad. his dad thinks that he spends to much time with WIllie and I when in realtity he spends teh most time with Willie.  his dad doesn't really like taht cory sees me instead of working wich makes it even harder to see me becasue he tells me that he is going to work and then he never does wich makes me upset. I am just so confused  i dont knwo waht to do i feel like i am not supporting him in a way tha ti like to be supported so i feel like i am not being a good girl friend. i dont understand what is really happeneing and id ont think cory knows either. i want to go and see him and hug him and tell him everything is fine and that i am there for him if he needs it. i dont understand what is wrong with me i care abotu Chris i really do but i know taht he doesn't like me soi am the last person i am sure that he wants Cory seeing.  who knows what will happen i am sure everything si fune tghough that CHris will be okay and so will Cory.  i wish i understod though i really do it isn't like me to bnto relaly know what i feel. I do know ifeel afraid, confused, hurt, and numb. i dont knwo why though wich is the hard part. the hardest part is that i knwo there is nothign i can do, absolutly nothing to make it better. i can tell cory is hurting i just dont knwo what to do ihate it i mean i know that all i can do is tell him that i am here for him and to remind him to just ask but he is so thick headed that i dont think that he would. I am afraid for Chris i dont knwo what is going to happen with him and i dont want himt o be to seriuosly hurt because that will end up hurting cory. 
Cory has already gone through way too much in his life i dont want him to have to deal with his dad getting sick. i geuss i am afraid of him dieing i dont know why i think it is because he had a shortness of breath and lost feeling to his arms.  i am just so confused what to think like i care becasue cory cares but ther is nothign i can do to make thigns better.  
My parents are goign out of town this weekend and i wanted Cory to come over for some of it and hang out with me.  he told me that he was going to ellensburg to pay bills. i asked if i oculd come along and brign my dog but he didn't know. i dont think he wants me to come very bad. i am just hoping that thigns will work out with his dad, and with me. i am selfish and i feel like i am not important to h im sometimes. i know that i am but right now i don't feel like i am.  He has a lot on his mind now so i need to just give him his space and try to be there how ever that is for him.
Well i am just sitting at work waiting for the receptinist to come in. i wish i just understood the world around me but i dont. Growing up is hard but we all get to do it. take care everyone
Love ya,

"event","Well my live journal friends i miss you all in such diffrent ways. so i thought i would give you guys the update. I am working at MacDonald-Miller where my mom works i am doing HR work there so basicly i am there bitch! but i am making 15 an hour so i dont really care to much. 
I have been hanging out with Anna a lot this summer wich has been a ton of fun. I have gone to one mariner game with Cory which was a blast as well.
Anouther fun new thing for me is that i have been playing ultimate frisbee on a team!!! it has been so much fun i have learned a lot already i am pretty much one of the only people who dont play at school and i have gotten a lot better. i am starting to understand stack and how to defend and throw the disk far enough.  i am kinda sore from playing but when i streach i can touch my toes!! granted that isn't that special but it is for me. 
Cory and i are good we are coming up on our year and half on the 27 of July which also happens to be my old bosses wedding. so i am excited that i was invited. 
Nothing really to exciting on my front i wish i could tell you that there was something but life is pretty much the same old same old. Work, Work, some play and of course shoping.
Liz if you are reading this i miss you a ton i want you to come home so i can hang out with you and catch up because i knwo for one you hate the phone and two you are in Germany.
Tim i left you a message saying that i missed you but here you go here as well.
Mandii i hope that your trip to Arizona is safe and you make it there with no problems
Luke we need to go bowling sooner then later because i would love to know how you have been doing i mean you are going to be a Senior this year already it is crazy!
Well hope everyone is well

"event","Well it was happy till i got back to school you know it is always such a blast driving over the pass when it is snowing and you start to slide so you and your boyfriend decided to pull over try to put on your chains can't so you ask for help the guy does it no problem and then you guys are back on your way your left tire is making a  stragne loud noise that just doesn't sound right so you calll your boyfriend you guys pull over everything looks fine so you start up and you hear honking and then you role down your window to some nice person telling you taht your chain has fallen off so instead of fixing it you contiue to drive with one chain.  then the other tire starts to do the same thing you stop agian and then decided know what you are over the hard part of the pass so you and your boyfriend are going to take off his chains and your one. you can't seem to get it off so you call over your BF who doesn't really want to try casue it is cold it gets stuck but after much much strogle your boyfriend wins and you are back off agian on the ""open"" road tha tyou dont go more then 30 miles per hour till cle elem and even then you only go 50. you finnaly get to school pull infront of the hall you live in start unpacking and realize some shit resident had switched all the on duty picuters and moved yours on the other board who does that? i mean what are you 10? come on it is just frustrating because you whould think that people whole want to know who was on duty not just wopnder who the name was now they whould know who they were specially if they were just wondering around the hall. oh well.

Well enough bitching i had a great break worked at VS and spent way to much money there..opps. well it was fun they want me to come back during the summer which makes me want to figure out even more what i am doing do i want to stay and take classes do i want to be a manager for hte summer? or do i just want to go to BCC and live for free and get to see all my fam i havn't been home for a summer yet since college so who knows.

Cory and i are great we are coming up on one year who can believe that? i can but it doesn't seem like that long or that short i dont really know waht it feels like... but it has been fun and worth it.  i can't wait cause for chrsitmas my fam gave him and i seahawks tickets so tha twas fun Lorn (my bro) my mom cory and i all went it was a blast.  even though Cory and Lorn had never met so it was good that they got  along we all know lorn can be an  intresting guy but it all worked out in the end. it was fun over all so Coryu and i are good and still going stronge. we spent new years eve togeather and that was nice it was my first kiss on new years and it was with someone i love so that is good.  

Well back at school start classes on wed and i am way buisy this quearter but i am secreatly excited but really nervus about it Blankity blank, Ernest and 14 credits to deal with this querater oh yea nad being an RA and getting all of those things done but tommrow we are talking about our schedral and then i will be able to plan all my programs i am excited!!! well i should stop now i am tired but i hope this is a good update of where i am and what i am up to take care

"event","Well that is a question i think i have been asking myself since hmmm lets see since i was like 11? maybe even earler probly the first time Lorn told me i wasn't aloud to come and along because i was a girl.  but the things is i whould never changed it i woudlnt want to be a guy.  i like being a girl i really do but there are some really hard things about it sometimes.  I mean this past year and a half so much has changed so much has happened i seem to just not really know who i am what i am doing or why i do what i do.  I always veiwed myself as a stronge intependet person now i look at myself and i wonder if i can makemy own decisions.  I know that i can i mean really i am 20 years old i a live kinda by myself, i have a job, a boyfriend taht i love, i am going to finnish my degree in FOUR years. i have seen a lot of death had to handdle very difficult situations and recently i havn't been able to remeber the simple things at all.  this time last year i could tell you the littlest detail that you told mewhen you thought i wasn't compleatly paying attention and now i am paying attention and ihave no idea what just went on. I dont like that i used love the fact that i could tell you anything and everything on a drop of a hat about someone else and special things that they didn't think i would remember but i did becuase i cared not that i dont care now but for some strange reason i feel like it doesn;t show that i do. It has been hard i want to remember those things i want to have fun i wantto not be stressed.i want to be care free i want to enjoy my life for what it is and what is to come not for what is happening.  i dont want to worry about finnishing my programs going to rehearsal and not foreting about homework.  i want free time to do things i want to do i want to have more friends taht i care abotu and that care about me! i lvoe the ones i have and tehy are great and i know taht i and i would never give them up for anything.  i love my life i thought i had it all everythinhg was going my way now i am not usre i dont remember anything i cry a lot and i just wish that things would be like they used to be simple.  but then i tink about all the things that have changed and how much i love them Cory is a great part of my life a wonderful thing that has happened to me nothing in the world could change the feelings i have for him nothing.  He has helped me become who i am today and has helped mold meinoto my happy parts of my life.  I also charish my friends and the things they do for me they suport me in my endevors and help me make good choices. i dont even know what i am trying to say
I started off wanting to write about why i cry alll the time because i dont know i dont think i ever will it is something that is ever changing and is something that helps me get through thigns. but i didn't use to cryand i got through things just fine.  now i cna't control it i feel like someone hurt me or like they arn't trying or maybe i am trying to hard it sucks cause i dont want those people in my life to feel like they arn't good enough or me to feel likei am not goood enough for them becaues we are good enough for eachother or we wouldn't be togeather. I wish i could understand these changes that havce gone on but i can't.  i mean one little things sends me right over it isn't' like me to not be able to put on a smile and pretend or truly belive that nothing is wrong.  
but i am getting older and diffrent things are starting to make me happy but the feeling of failer still makes me sad, the idea that i could disapoint someone doesn't help either. maybe i do need to stop taking htings so personaly and stop trying so hard be who i am who i used to be someone who is happy someone who chose her attitude and chose a good one be the same old Ashlee Conner who didn't really care what people thought as long as she was happy and doing things she loved that was all that mattered.  remembering that ihave people to suport me people who care and most of all people that love me nad i love them.  making a diffrence in peoples lives is what i enjoy so maybe i should start tring to do taht mroe often or maybe i shouldnt try and just do it. wow growing up still sucks but realizing what needs to change is part of growing.  i hope everything gets better soon 
heres to hopeing

"event","I came home to Issy on wed and have been just kicking it around.  I was able to Anna, Pam, Ash, and Deanne so it has been succesful enough.  Thanksgiving was good i played Fooball in the morning as i do every year and then had thanksgiving dinner with my fam.  i didn't make my normal rounds i was to tired because i was just so buisy at school and i wans't really in the mood for once to go and drive.  Oh well that is just the way life goes.  I really havn't been doing much so that was good i finnished some of my theater stuff but not my RA stuff baby steps! 
Life has been over all good i havn't eally been doing anything diffrent then normal class rehearsal RA and Cory.  everything over all has been quite nice a little stressed very moody but i think that is cause i am not eating enough so i need to work on that.  oh well i geuss i need to keep myself going and taking all my meds everyday.  I have been doing alright in classes i am doing a lot better then i was in TH history so that is good. Anthro i am not sure if it is any better but one can hope.  
Cory and i have been dating for almost 10 months it will be on Monday so that is kinda exciting because we all know that this is a long relationship for me and that i never really knew what i wanted untill him. so that is exciting in its own way i have grown a lot in the past year so that is good but it will be important for me to remember that he will be going through changes as well because he is a year behind me in school.  i know i know younger guys well i like them.  Hmmm i dont have much to say.
I applyed for two jobs this week and should be getting phone interveiws this week from Vicotia Secreates and Express i really hope VS wants me because i dont really wantto work at Express cause i dont wantto have to buy there clothes to work there VS i think i could do stock and be successful at selling bras and giving wemon confidence in themselves.  oh well my mom doesn't want me to work and she is probly right but i like having money to spend and know taht i earned it.  well i hope that it will work out cuase most of my friends are gone or working themselves and Cory will be working so i can't see him all the time either so who knows i have some things that i need to do over break but i could have my schedral work aorund it if i needed. 
I also need to figure out what i am going to do for New Years this would be the first year that i might get a new years kiss on newe years.  last year Cory and i saved ours for the 3rd which at first was kinda a joke but who whould have thought it would turn into a 10 month relationship still going stronge?  so hopefuly him and i can hang out for new years.  the sucky thing is that i have to be back on the 1st by 5 so that is a downer.  oh well i guess win some you lose some.  
Well i hope all is well

"event","So nothing to intesting has been going on, on the Ashlee Front latly. i havn't done anything cool really i found out that my mom is moving back to issy this saterday and friday is her last day at work.  Lorn is coming with her so if it is not snowing i get to see my bro and my mom and it will be great. My brother is bringing me doctor phil stuff so i am excited and i know Mandii will love it for her mom and i like makeing people happy i have this werid upsesion with buying and making things for people i dont knwo why but i like them being able to have joy in things that i do. I know Cory has a hard time realizing that is what i like to do. oh well.
Classes are good they are classes i feel like i understand everything and then boom i fail the midterms.  i dont know what i am going to do next quarter when i have two gen eds i am hopeing that i dont flonder.  but i am excited the show is going well i hope i actrally start feeling like i know what i am doing and know exactly how things are going to work.  this show is intresting and i dont compleatly know what is going to happen.  also i am getting nervus for my spring show because i have so much to do.
On a good note i realized if i take a summer quarter i would be able to graduate in the fall if i reallly wanted. so i think i might find a minor that seems intresting to me or might go on tour for the childrens show. I need to figure out if i want to be an RA agian this year has been hard already and the first quarter isn't over. I want to do it casue i love my job i love my girls i love most of my staff team, and my area.  it is intresting how something can change so fast from something i love to something that i am not haveing fun with.  it isn't like me to not have fun, i enjoy life i am supose to like things and make the best of things i mean i got through last year didn't 'i?  i dont know what to do, i feel like i have all these expectations and i dont know what to do with them i feel like the bar has been risen and i feel like i can reach it if i havn't already, but i never know if i am going to reach it our not cause people dont tell me how to follow up with the expectaion that has been set forth by them. it has just been hard i feel alone agian i have Cory and my friends here but not really i mean i dont hang out with people because id ont know what to talk to them about theater? my job? i mean those are the key things that build up who i am right now i mean there is Cory and i dont' want to bore them with every detail about my boyfriend and me.(even though it is great he makes me way happy still).  it is werid i think i wanted this year to be bettter then last year and it is so diffrent i dont know what to do. my residents like me they are proud to say that is my RA and they come to me for things that maybe they wouldnt come to if it was someone else. 
So basicly i have a ton onmy mind today but i feel like i can't talk to anyone about them if that makes sense? not that i couldnt talk with them about it i just dont want to. hmmm. oh well.  this is where i am going to leave it

Lots has gone on in the last month and i have had lots of random things that i never thought would happen, happen. But over all life has been pretty good.  Cory and i are great we went through a mall spell where everything wasn't up to par but that has changed recently so that is relaly good and that makes me really happe!! 
Rehearsals start next week i am excited becaue they only go from 6-9 which sounds stupid that i am excited but it is better then till 10.  Life is pretty boring i feel like i should have more to write about but i dont i mean nothing to exciting has happened to make me want to write. Cory and i are almot at 9 months which is scary and excited all at once because it is the longest relationship i have had and it has been a good one.  
I went shoping today i found great winter boots i can't wait to wear them cause i didn't use to have any type of shoe to wera in the snow. i also bought some new shirt it was over all a good day.
Well i hope thi helps with what i have been up to nothing to exciting oh well.

"event","Well i have made it through the last week, was able to pack my truck with the help of Beth and able to unpack with the Help of Twin.  i have been feeling a lot of random things latly.  it is hard to explain. everybody is asking how my summer has been what i have been doing so i tell them i went to Idaho, orientation bumbed around and my grandfather passed away so i went to Canada for the past 3 days for a funral. they tell me that they are sorry to hear that (which i believe) and i tell them that i am okay.  they ask me if i am sure. i dont know i geuss i tell them that i am fine and that i was kinda upset there but here i seem to be alright.  and Lori and JOn and i were joking about how what happens in Canada can stay there so now that i am home no more Mornning...lol... i dontknow i am sure it will all hit me agian.  i mean in the last year i have lost 2 very very close people to Cancer and one of my residents.  it has been a very hard and draining year. Luckly i have great friends, Family and a wonderful Boyfriend who is always willing to be my sholder to cry on or just calls to cheek in because i knew he couldn't be with me when i was in Canada. I dont know growing up is kinda hard not like we all didn't knwo that before but now it is starting to become way to real.  trying to explain to my cousins why i woudlnt go and veiw my grandfather they just kept asking dont you want to see PaPa one last time?  it is hard to tell children raging in ages 3-10 that it isn't taht easy for me and that i miss him but i am not ready to see him agian.  but one day i know i will so that conferts me a lot.  anouther hard thing was that Lorn my brother couldn;t make it and Lorn was really close to my grandpa i mean he was the olderst grandson/grandchild and i the number one granddaughter of 9 little blonde girls.  My uncle Loren(yes same name as my brother) put it best in his uligiy ""there are 11 grandchilden two boys on either end and nine blonde little girls to fill the gap."" it is kinda hard to think about it so i am almost done.  My grandfather before he died he gave me his fly fishing rod because he knew about my new found love for fishing over this past year. He also had this monkey in his room that he made all the Nurses squeze when they came in and it whistles, so he gave all 11 of us these monkeys to remember him by so enough about this sad stuff.

I know that I'm here tittle implies that i should talk about being here not about my sad stuff.  so i will i am in the Green Manager apartment. for all of you who care the address is 1611 N. Alder  Green 108 Ellensburg WA 98926 

I have had a good time moving in i am not compleatly unpack and i know everyone is not suprised by that.  i hung out with Twin yesterday and we went to the dollar tree and fredmyer and did someother things.  then Tiff and steve and i went to Wendys and ate dinner i had a salad.  it was good fun.  well i am just hanging out with Tyson Matt and Tiff really the only thing missing is Cory.  but oh well everything is all well

"event","I went to Pippen today and i just had to keep reminding myself that i am a theater major who studies lights and i shouldnt judge a 17 year old who has worked on all of 4 shows with lights.  but it was just so hard to watch i dont know the plot was intresting and the choice of color was okay i could see what they were.  i was strugling with the concept and what the color palet was as well as what the purpose of the set was.  i dont know the singing was good, i liked Pippin, Naratior and the girls.  id ontknow over all the show just didn't impress me.  it didn't hold up to Village Theater Par, i mean i have gone to these shows since like i was in 4th grade.  but yea

Besides that my life is pretty boring so maybe that is why i am so criticle about the show because it is like the only thing i did today.  i washed my car i geuss which by the way you can tell but it still looks not that clean.  i watched ""THe Importance of Being Earnest"" and ""She's the Man""  both were alright shows.  i enjoyed them enough to maybe watch them again i get to like Earnest because i will be working on it in the Spring.  

Tommrow i get to see Ashley who i havn't seensince like March so i am excited.  i get to play frisbee as well whichi havn'tdone fora while either. then hang out with beth which is exciting as well.  Saterday i am going to breakfest with Emma which is kinda sad becasue she is moving for the year which is so werid. but that is part of growing up i geuss things change i was starting to think it wasn't going to for awhile and i liked that idea but oh well.  life is great now so that is waht conts. after breakfest i am going to hopefuly the Zoo with Cory tommy and elveta (tommys spanish girlfriend).  

That is pretty much it havn't a alrgith time just catching up onsleep and stuff and bummming my way around my house and issy.  well take care and hope all is well

"event","Well i cam back into Issaquah yesterday morning, but that isn't to say that i didn't get done on Friday and drove to UP to see Cory. it was his birthday on Saterday so i went to stay the night with his Cousin Eric's house who i have never met it was great he liked me not that i was super worried. but still i was happy that i met someone who Cory cares a ton about.  we went to Lake Fair in Olympia and walked around looked at the water it was fun and nice.  then Saterday Cory's birthday we went back to his dad's house and hung out there for a while, and then went to Dupont where his mom and Cousin live for a BBQ and hanging out with family.  it was nice Cory seemed to be really really happy.  when we got to Cory's mom house i gave him the present i bought him a Longboard wich is for our 6 months and his birthday.  but i know he really liked it he kept telling me how great his birthday was. so i think it was a success. 

Sunday i stayed agian with Cory and we went to Best Buy and bought a new sound Card for his computer so the speakers that his cousins bought him would work.  and then that night we went on a walk and it was really nice we never do that because well we live in diffrent cities.  but it was nice i love walking and it has been so long since i have done that. sunday was fun Cory and i spent a lot of one on one time on Sunday. that night well monday early morning i woke up shaking i dont know why but i couldnt stop, it was really werid but adventraly i fell asleep and Cory was there to make sure i was safe, i really love him.  he really cares about me it is great.  

Monday i came home early because Cory had to work and i ate lunch with Michlle that was fun havn't done that for a while.  and then went to Liz's pool and got some more color and then did some laundry.  i havn't been feeling to well dam heat it kills me.  but i am sure i will be fine in a couple of days.  well that is the recap today i have to clean the house my dad is coming home and he can't come home to a dirty house. take care

"event","So i have been is E-burg i have been working orientation having a good time doing that pretty thankful to be done.  i went home on Sat i miss issy i wish i was there being there made me miss it even more. :( and Cory and i were both there and i was able to hang out with my friends it was great. i dont know how Liz liked him quite yet but she seemed to be cool with him, which is good cause all my firends at least can stand him and can tell that he makes me happy. We all so went to breakfest with Beth and T-ray which was also fun. and they both seemed to like him a ton. 

Orientation is almost done. i am so excited not that i dont love the people but i am just getting tired and it shows. it shows on all of us we are getting to a point where we dont know what to think anymore.  the days just seem to get longer which you couldnt think be true. but it is. we are finnishign up what we were going to get for Christien for a ""hey this is your last orientation thing"" and it looks really good we are going to finnish it up tommrow night and present it to her on friday night.

I head back to Issy on the 22nd it is Cory's b-day and i am going to see him i am excited i cant say what i am getting him yet besides the fact my mom asked if it was to much money.  but i think he will really like it.  i dont knwo if he has picked up that i am getting him it for our 6th month slash b-day so i kinda hope he picks up that clue...lol...

Well i hope all is well i am going to leave and try to sleep

"event","Okay so i took a really big step for me today i went to the buety school and got my hair cut...i would like to add that i have had the same person cut my hair basicly since i was 7 with one or two others.  but it looks good i mean it was worth 6$ and it grows. so no big deal i am sure that you all will see me soon and get to enjoy what is Ashlee's new hair cut and all it's glory.  the kicker is Cory doesn't knwo i got it cut i have been talking about it but i was unsure if i wanted to or not.  but i did. jon says it looks nice i made him come with me...lol i didn't want to go alone. i knwo i am a loser... 
Well..Orientation three is over we are only down one leader and superviser.  but it has been great i mean i am ready for home but i am still having a great time. i am way tired but this weekend hopefuly will be good because i am tired and i NEED sleep. i only get like 4 hours  of sleep every night and then have 17 hour days. but it has been worth it i dont know what else i would have been doing to be perfectly honest. 
I am going to issy this weekend to see Cory spend time with my papa and my friends who i miss terrably. but oh well life goes on and i eventraly get to talk to them. 
Well that is it for now i am going to take a nap....woot woot.

"event","Well i havn't writen in forever you see, yet so much has happened. i went to McCall Idaho for two weeks doing an internship which was fun. i learned diffrent things or lets say i have improved on those that i already had.  i was talking Derek today and he heard that i did good so that is also good it helped that i had a profesor there that knew me.  Ellise is awsome by the way she is a little hard to get to know i think but i am so glad that she had the faith in me as well as given me the advice to go and take this chance.  it was a lot offun happy to be back in the WA. but when i got here i came back to the E-burg which was great i saw Cory for one night and then embarked on a journy that i like to call orientation.  orenation has abeen a blast this past couple of weeks i have found new friedns that i am excited that i am getting to work with which i will admit that orignaly i didn't think i would get along with allof them so well. but i do and it has been great long and tireinbg but great.  i dont really have a lot to say so much happens and i got the Bee today (which is like a award thing that someone gives to one and passes it along to knew people everyday) so that was nice.  but i dont have a ton to say so i am going to leave it at that.  if you want to knwo more i am sure one day i will add it.  

For the fourth i went home and swam with Liz and Anna which was nice.  and hten drove toT-town...okay university placce and spent time with cory and his family which was nice.  dont have much to say about that either ii am so boring today sorry. i am tired i think i amgoing to bed now.
take care

"event","WOW idont even know where tostart. i guess this si waht i get for not writing for so long....lol...well i am back at school this quarter has been going great i have had a lot of growing to be done. i have had lots of things to deal with taht they tell you in traning might happen and now that it actraly has i dont know what to think. i dont know i am working through a lot of stuff right now, that idont really know the answers to but i am working towards them. i have had lots of things on my mind before this whole thing even happened. and now there is just one more for me to think about. well it is what i signed up for what i like what i wanted to do. i knew what emotinal things iwould be doing and how it would affect me and how it has. i am unable to go anywhere on Campus without being in RA mode as i like to call it. it is frustrating caues up in other halls i am not in charge but i can stilltake it ifi need to. but oh well.

Also my classes are going well, i have 18 creidts and have been having a lot of fun trying to accomplish all of them great fun let me tell you. my musical theater class is really hard and i feel like i amfalling behind the whole weekend thing didn't help me start off this week good. but what did help is that there is a guy that i went to the moives with tonight, it was fun. and last night when i was upset we tlaked on line for like anhour becaseu he wasnt' back in the e-burg yet. it has been good ireally enjoy being around him, just thinking about him makes me smile ihate it and love it at the same time. he always asks me why i am smilling and i can never really give him an answer. mostly because it is because of him. 

I dont know but it has been a long month yet a good one at the sametime. there has defently been high and low points the whole time, but it is allpart of life we grow up we change and sometimes for the better others forthe worse oh well we live andlearn that is just the way we work. well i am out

"event","Well the New Year is approaching fast i am getting excited i think i finnaly figured out what i want to do for the new year and that is go back to E-burg a day early and celibrate there. i feel like i need ot not be in issy because i am starting to grow up the break was a well needed one i am so thankful tha ti have had the oppertunity to be away form other peopels problems and i have been able to worry about mine. well id ont really have to many problems but sometimes it is good to worry abotu myself instead of everyone else.  when i am at school i am a role model some of my residents looka t me for advice just like i looked to mine last year. i have instilled in them a safe place to go when they know that they need to talk to someone or what to talk to someone.  it is intresting to watch how things change over time. last year i hung out with totaly diffrent people did tottaly diffrent things. well not compleatly still wasnt' a hevy drinker apparently i like to wait till after ACTF to enjoy alchol as much as i did. i am hoping that it wont happen sicne i am an RA that i wount want to drink as much as i did last spring it is kinda intresting to look back and think about how much i really did drink.

I really enjoy looking back at old entries and how diffrent my thought proccess was. i am starting actrally grow up it is werid. Beth and i had our first real grown up converstaion in McDonnads which i realize is a compleatly random place to have a conversation but it was a big step for her and i i thin it was the first one we have really had.  she looked at me part way thorugh it and was like ""conner when did we turn into wemon?"" i dont really know it is werid her and i would have never had these converstations a year ago. i think her having  a boy friend is good for her.  i am so glad that she can finnaly understand what i was always talkig about with cuddleing and kissing an every thing like that.  in that regards Anna is as well growing and changing it is intresting i love her so much she is so cute.  she would ask me questions on if i had cuddled ceritan ways it was intresting cause beth and i were haveing similar convos, it is intresting i dont know what happened this past year we have all grown up and changed i am saying tha twe are learnign things that we will take with us into our Adult hood which happens age wise for Anna first then me for ten days and then beth. i am excited to see what the new experiance will bring our friendships....who knows maybe secrates that i have kept oh so clsoe to myself will come out i hardly doubt it but who knows.  it is one of those things that i wish i would have never started that lie. cause i am afraid now that it will rewin what ever beth nad i have because in reatlity most of our relationship is built on a lie taht i started tha ti fed and i enjoyed. 

BUt that lie hasn't been being fed since i have been home it was nice i spent the night at Beths last night and i didn't even see graham it ws really nice it feels good to wake up this morning knowing that i didn't do anything stupid. and hte thing about stupid things is taht stupid is all circemtstatial. (i know i spelled that wrong) it is all up to the eye of the beholder, it is intresting becusae a stupid thing doesn't sound so stupid when we are older it seems to come more and more easier it is kinda intresting becasue that is why i am afraid to try so many things in fear that  i might enjoy it to much and want to keep doing it. but that is why it i was a persanal victory not seeing graham and nothaving done anything with him. 

I look foward to going to school and auditing for the shows and hopefuly having something to work on next quarter if not it might be really good becuase i ahve so much to do next quarter but who knows we will get to see i wouldnt mind to work on the ACTF ensamble thing so i could go to ACTF for a reason and actrally do something there.  

Well this is my life as i like to see it.  it is intrestign Liz and i were talkign abotu how now that i am older everything doens't fit in my box everythign isn't Black or White which i knew but it is intresting that i am starting to see in diffrent shades and either a my box is gettign bigger or i think it is broken and flattned and i have to wait to rebuild my box. things change as we get older that is why it is called life that is why we do the things we do and what ever we do hosuld only mattter to us.  that is the way life works we need to stip careing so much about others well anyways with that i will leave you with one last thing.

Judge me all you want, but keep the verdict to yourself

Luv yea,

"event","Well since i am home,

I thought i would up date....i mean i dont knwo why i dont know waht to think anymore. itis werid when i am at school i can be off in my own little world mine no one elses what i do only effects me...well kidna i mean it effects others but when i am home my actions effect more peopel i care about. when i am here i have more people i wantt ot hang out with more peopel i am willing to go the extra mile to see and spend time with. i am not saying people at CWU arent worth it they are but there we are all on such diffrent schedrals we get togeather when we can for however long that we are able to and or want. it is werid when i am here all the feelings of home come back which i realize no brainer hello i am home.  but the feelings that i run away from when i am at school, the ones i tell myself that i dont need or i dont want them anymore. yet the moment i drive back into issy all my problems are back well diffrent ones the ones i left 3 months ago and was happy that i did.  it is the realization that it isnt' just my life anymore it is the lives of many others that i learned to care and love. the thoughts that i havnt though since summer return even when i came back for thanksgiving i didn't think these i was fine but now that i kwno i am home for a long period of time i am scared, i wonder if i will be able to stay true what i believe in.  it is hard to explaine it is the whole thing about the butterflies youget when they call, waht do you do once htey are gone? get over it becuase you know you are ready but what happens if they come back?? are they the same buterflies that you felt earlier?  it is funny i told my friend at school you will always love your first love but love changes as we grow older you can still love that person but your sense of love might have changed and your ready to move on. and yes it will hurt with out them but maybe you are ready to not love them that way anymore. it is hard i hate how i will give this advice yet i wont follow it. 

I am startign to realize that i am the other girl more offten then i would like to be, it is frustrating i wonder if it is becuase i dont want a relationship, and i get cought up in the moment in what we had or what we might have, ia ms o afraid to live in the waht ifs of the world instead of nows. but other times i am great at living in the nows and then i look back with the waht if i didnt do that. but you can't live like that so you have to choose the what if's now or the what ifs later i dont get it why is it so hard to be a teenager, why is it so hard for me to want to be with someone why am i afraid?  these questions go through my head all the time every time i like someone evyer time i start seeing someone i ask all these things. and yet the answer comes out i am nto good enough, i dont want to get hurt, i dont want to hurt them, or my fav eh it wouldnt work out anyways i dont have time.  it is so frustrating i set myself up to fail every time and the only person i can blame is myself, that is it i have no one else to blame, at times i wish i could but i dont. so i geuss i need to get over it i need to stop being so pickey i need to not be afraid to fail or get hurt, getting hurt is part of the growing up process. i am starting that process i am starting to not care about others lives as long as they feel they are being safe then i have to trust them that is a huge step for me. 

It is intresting with the new year aproaching i think it is a time to reflect on everything that has happened in the last year, how diffrent things have changed how diffrent things are now.  it si werid if you woudl have asked me a year ago i wouldnt think i would be here, i feel like i have grown a lot changed a lot delt with a lot.  it is intresting to see how diffrent things are now, now that my freinds and i have had a year at college. we all have had diffrent experiance taht ia m sure has molded us into what we are today which is obvious but it is intresting up untill last year we were growing togeather now we have been set free and set to do our own thing learn for our selves. whihc was a huge step for all of us we were set free only god knows why our parents let that happen, some of us were ready for the challenge some of us were forced to be ready, others waited to start the race. yet we all have started and all are moving towards a goal a goal to get the hell out of here and start our own lives with us as the tour guid. as scary as that is i mean at least for me. who konws what next year will bring i am excited and scared who knows maybe i will find someone maybe my freinds will to. it is kinda werid this whole paragrah well mostly this whole entry feels like a graduation speach so ia m going to stop before i go any deeper. it is werid this is the first time i have been able to write and feel like i didnt ahve to but i watned to for a long time so i took advantage of it so well that is all for now.

But i feel like i should at least discuss the last 2 weeks that i have been doing i spent three of the five days last week in Al Monty that was a lot of fun it was great being somewhere were i was not the RA but i still was but know one really knew i was if hta tmakes sense.  the last ngiht was the best, we didn't really do much...well i geuss we did come to think about it. i play poker lost two dollars i was also the second one out. so the first person and i went and played crib instead i won cribe the first time he won teh second and then the thrid tyson got mad at Cory and i and hit hte table and the peices went everywhere so we just stoped. but during the game i felt the need to snap Cory in the leg with the rubber band that was a mistake it turned into a huge rubber band fight....it was fun though we started to chase eachother down the hall and then we finnished our game of crib.  then i went ot bed and tyson and i coudlnt sleep (we were in diffrent beds if you must know) so i told him tha tiw as going to go and suprise Cory and snap him with the rubber band. (yes i knwo i am in college) well his door was locked there goes the eliment of suprise so i walk half way to tysons room and wisper the door is locked and hten i went back and knocked on the door.....and he answered it and was like are you going to snap me i had my hands behind my back and i was like NO i am not going ot snap you and hten i tryied to so he ran towards tysons room and got in the bed that i was sleeping in and then i tried to snap him after that Tyson started to intervein and was like you guys can't play this anymore and grabs me and holds me down while Cory taps me on the head and i still had the rubber band in my hand and then tyson got it out of my hand and then was like do you trust me and iw as like yea i trust you and if you hit me with that rubber band i am going to hit you so hard and then he was like doy ou turst me and i was like yea i do. and then he snaped Cory instead :) and then Cory left and came back and showed us that Tyson gave him welts on his arm it was kinda funny. then Tyson and i stayed up talking for a bit i tottaly felt like iw as at a birthday party or slumber party and you jsut dont want to go to sleep cuase you feel liek you should be tlaking abotu something. it was a great night and then i finnished my decs last night and put them up and hten i cheeked every single room in kamola and Sue for stupid safty people cant' read very well so many poeple didn't do everythign they wre supose to. it was stupid, well anyways tha twas my fun so far i havn't writen for a while so i decied this is better then a few short ones.

Many things have happened since the last time i wrote but i dont knwo what i want to even write about.  I leave the E_burg tommrow to go back to issy i can't wait it is going to be amazing. 

I want to write about all the fun things i have been doing but at the same time i just dont want to. i got plently inside jokes this show, i am also pretty sad because of all the people who are leaving after this quarter :( but it was great getting to know them.  i have also done things that i thought would never happen, i am kinda suprised it happen actrally but it was fun and worth it.  e3ach night it was diffrent it was great one of hte best nights was photo call becasue i didn't really have to do anything supper neat i jsut got ot kick it with peopel who weren't in the shot, so a lot of hte time i was able to flirt and or catch up wiht people. 

 i dont knwo i feel like i should be saying more but i don tknwo what i want to talk about so i am going to leave it with this the last month has been a blast and if you really want to t knwo about it i will let you in on it.  I would say that this quarter has defently changed my look on  a lot of things i can also tell i have been hangin out with to many boys because the jokes i am starting to make and the tolerance that i am showing for things that i would normaly never do is just amazing to me. my veiws on life in genral are chaniging it is great and i love it but i will end now and leave with the comment i lvoe what i am becoming and wonder how much more of my life will change.

I am so tired these days the days get longer and longer and it is some times by chooice and others it is because i have to. i get so raped into life that i dont knwo when to stop. i have been way emoitinal these last couple of days. today i just broke into tears (ok a few were shead) in basic acting class becasue i did so bad on my test, adn assimment it has been getting stupid lately i wish it wasn't this way. i have been having a really hard time dealing with things that shouldnt be affecting me the way that they are. 

i tottaly thought iw as dealling with everything so well and now i am starting to wonder. i am getting frustrated about stupid shit stuff that really doesn't matter. i mean somone used the same poster as me in my hall how lame was that. i mean i got so pissed and i am jus getting so frustrated with everything i mean i am trying to do my job but i get in trouble because my voice is louder then others. it is stupid and sicne my fellow RA's know my nane my name gets written down even though i am not the only talking or i am not even talking ia m trying to keep them down and then i get in trouble and it is so out of context and it sucks.

life will get better i know that and i jsut have faith in it getting better. speaking of faith one of my good friends here who i have talked to about religon a few times told me today that he got off the fence and was saved this weekend i was so happy i didn't kwno waht to say i still dont but i know that god works in great ways. but man i am tired so i am going to roll.
Love

"event","Sorry it has been so long,
i have a lot to say but i dont really know how to write it i dont knwo where to start i wish i did but i can't find a spot so much happens everyweek that is diffrent from the last yet it still feels like the same old shit. i dont really get it anymore i am starting to stop trying to figure shit out. i feel like i should be writing down all this stuff but i truley dont knwok where to start or end. everyday my feelings change and everyday my life changes nothign is ever the same nothing i never feel the same way any day. i do the same thing everyday go to class, eat, rehursal, and then hang out with residents who are now my friends. it is even werider i dont hang out with people from last year in fear that my residnets might be there it is horriable i hate it. but at the same time i love waht i do i love being an Ra i love the peopel i have met and the relationships tha ti have built i know that i am important to this hall that people might have left if i wasnt' here. i tell people how not to be homesick and to tell them that it does get better there is light at the end of the tunnel. the E-burg is boreing but there is more to life then just parting and there is always something to do and if they think there isn't then they can find me and we will find something even if it is just a movie or soemthing. 
If i am not here in Kamola i am out in McConnel those are my two homes i dont really leave ellensburg i got to this weekend and saw my mummy and daddy and my best friends new appartment which was weird in its own. i had a good weekend it is long thought, having rehursal for like 8 hours makes for long long days. i dont knwo the show is going well it is a lot of work even though i feel like i am doing nothing the whole time. i will be more of a key player once the show starts and i am actrally doing the run of the show it will make for even longer weeks then i already have. 
I dont knwo what else to really say my life is pretty borign i must say, i wish i could tell you that it wastn' but it is, it is kinda depersing which is how i am starting to feel i dont knwo why though i just get this way sometimes i can't really explaine it but i get these werid spells where all i want to do is just run away and not tlak to peopel ever agian and yet i end up tlaking to poeple because i care to much about them, and i know that i can't not tlak to people. i wish that life wasn't so hard sometimes i mean it seems like all is well you are figurign out shit and then boom life changes agian and you have to readjust to what ever is going on around you. oh well. ***sigh*** i am getting tired so ia m going to call it quites and i knwo that all the peopel who actrally read this tlakt o me when i need to talk to them to get all the detaIils that i knwo i have left out dont worry ia m not dieing i am just getting way buisy and it isn't looking anybetter soon. but i am out so i hope all is well

that means way to many things to me now i dont even get it. once i got to Kamola where i amm living now i met my staff team it was awsome, i have gotten to know them so well. i feel like it really doesn't matter that i was hired a week later then them. but i have been having so much fun. i am so tired but oh well. my staff team has gotten so close it is pretty amazing. i mean we have cuddel fests and many other fun staff team events. we also get to go on slurpie runs which make me so happy because i missed doing that and i wanted to do it this year before test but they do it all the time it is amazing. well i dont really know what i want to write about hte past week has been jamed full of stuff. i start classes tommrow i am excited but i am not at the same time. i can't wait to be back with everyone but ia m not ready to be that buisy it will be nutz. but oh well i choose this life i new that is what i was going ot faced with when i said yes i would love to. 

i am meeting a ton of new people i mean my staff team is amazing we do a lot togeather we even get to watch moves and things. well i am frustrated at the same time becasue out of 8 of the RAs on staff 2 of us are in the two buildings. but i am happy now because i just found some of them and i dont have ot stress out anymore but i will write more later probly tommrwo or tonight when ihave more time but i am out for now.

"event","It has been a week today since everything that I was starting to figure out and accept changed. ever since i made that call i haven't regreated it but i wish i never had to hear it. i dont believe it still and i dont kwo if i will. i went over there and it seemed so werid it seemed like nothing was wrong it was just that she had gone out fo rthe day or was at work or something and she would be home later, but she wasn't and never will be. it is so hard to think about someone our age loosign someone so close. and it is weird like all i want to do is be with people and not think about it but all i do is think about it. all the time and like everyone wants to talk abotu it to, everbody. 

I leave for school in 10 days this time last year i was freeking out i was getting ready to go and wondering what was to come. now i just don't want to pack i think it will be done eventually i do it not like i have anything better to do right now then to pack but i dont i just sit here and write about life and all its glory. I leave to go back to school in search of something, if it is happienss fufillment someone or even heaven forbid actraly an education. i feel that the moment i step back into CWU my life will get hectic, i wont hav etime for anything that isnt' planed into my day already, i have a 3 hour break which will be used to finnish up homework th at i hadnt' done because of something, eating and naping. i basically am in class from 10-10 with a 3 hour break and a 1 hour break but tha t1 hour break is just enough time to hall my ass back to norht campus and get my car so i can have it for when i come out of rehursal so i dont hav eto walk in the dark cold air alone. when i am at school it really is like i am alone i do everything alone i have firneds but we dont always have time for eachother and as much as i want to have time for them i dont and they dont for me either. i am kinda upset becasue i never got that call that said i should be an RA i dont kwno why i just keep wondering what i did wrong if it is me or somethign that i said. i just wonder what if they dont need anymore or if they will later and if then i will say yes becasue as the way htings look i already have a buisy life and i dont knwo if i need to add that to my mix of things. but it would be good to have that break in tuition it would be helpful and if i get hired and dont think i can do it anymore then ic an move back into the halls. i dont kwo, it has potential to suck and be a lot of fun

wow i am just rambaling i dont really knwo wha ti wnat to say what i need to say, i feel alone here i feel like i lost one of the people that means the most to me to this world that i dont even think she knows what it is, a world where she will be traped for hte rest of her life doing things that she thought she would have ever had to do at this age. everythign literlay change in a night and nothing has been the same since that night which wasnt' even a year ago.

Well i should stop rambaling and stop thinking about everything. but it is funny to think how diffrent my post is today then it was a year ago today. well i hope all is well

"event","Life is getting harder for some reason i dont get it. last night i went bowling, one of my farorite things and yet i havn't had a good time but i wasnt' myself. i just dont get it. i am starting to have one of those moods agian one of those that just make me feel like there really isn't a reason for living. but i never want to end my life so i look at that as a good thing. 

I just dont get it i get so mad at stupid stuff stuff that wouldnt' normaly make me sad or mad. i normaly dont care if id ont have anyone but latly it is has been hitting me way hard. being home i thought would be better i thought i would be happier here. i feel like the past month didn't even happen. i dont know life is just stupid and ia m jut throwing myself a pitty party i think. maybe i want to say that i am not but. i dotn get it i just want to figure it out.

It doesn't help that i am getting mad at my friends for stupid things. i mean they dont do anythign wrong to me but yet i can still get mad at them. i dont kwo i geuss it is one thing to be a hyprocrate and anouther trying to call yoru friend on the unchristian like motives. i will admit that i do it to, i flirt and then i am like well maybe i dont like them but i dont keep flirtign to see if that thoughtt changes oncei  figure out that i am not intrested. i just dont see the point of leadign somone on. it is funny i dont really think taht i have dated that much but i am already starting to realize what i dont want in a realationship and what i do want. it is funny becasue i can't even imagine finding the person that i want to spend the rest of my life with. 

I got ot see my friends cindy's baby last night it was so cute i got ot hold him and feed him it made me happy. i can't even imagine having kids right now. i can't even imagine bieng in a real relationship one where both of us carea bout eachother and want to be with eachother. it just scares me becaues i realisticly i would want tobe married in the next 10 years and if the next 10 years are anythign like the past 10 years i am really screwed...lol... well i am i geuss. 

Why is it that the ex's all feel the need to keep in touch with me, when i am finnaly at hte point where i dont need to hear from them ever agian and i would be happy about it they come out of no where call me text me im me and are like i miss you i am sorry. i hate it sorry isnt' good enough anymore for me it isnt' good enough for anything. i mean i am sick of being hurt becuase i try to be a nice person i try to be there for everyone. i trust peopel to much i trust them untill i cna't trust them anymore and the issue is tha ti always feel like it is my fault tha ti dont trust thema nd decided to give them one mroe try. it make sit frustrating becuase i reach out to peopel all the time yet when iam down i feel like no one cares. part of hta tis my fault i try ot obe the bigger person and when ic na't be i just fade aways and dont do anyting about it. but still it hurts i jsut want someoen to be emotinaly there for me becasue i feel like i need someone to hold me and tell me it will be ok. 

My friend tells me she doens't want anyone worrying about her abotu anything, but that isnt' the type of person i am. i care to much about other people even if it means that i get hurt in the end. life is hard and i have a small feeling it doesn't get any easier.

Everythign has changed in the past year i mean last year the only worry i had was what classes i was going to take and if i wanted to drink or not, now i am dealing with my best firends mom being ill, keeping in touch with friends, trying to battle the world alone at CWU knowing that people i tlaked iwth latst year could care less about me this year. it is going to be  a long year speicaly when i don kwo wha is going to happen here in issy. i need to find a job so i can actrally do things and make money.  well welcom to the real world i geuss. man one would hope that life wouldnt' blind fold you and spin you around 15 times and then let you try to pin excatly what you want to do. i think that is the best analogie i can come up with. well i think i might stop now i hope everything gets better soon so it can start being happy agian.

Peace out

"event","Well what to talk about i mean i am not the next tampax girl much to my distress. but i am going to a rap party tonight i am so excited. i get to hang out with the people i met this past week end. it should be fun i just hope that i dont give off a bad vibe. there are free drinks from 8-9 so i am getting there early to do so. i bought a new outfit and i have my hair all blow dryed and makeup on i am going to look hot and i am excited about it.  well it is kinda to bad that no one from home will actrally get to see me like this. i hope to take some pics of me and all the people i met this weekend.  well anyways nothing to exciting has happened since the last time i wrote. i watched the wedding crashers which BTW was awsome i would recomend it if you want to not be able to stop laughing. i saw Charlie and the Choclate Factory as well and it was ok not my fav but i htink it is because i liked the orginal so much. well what can you do?

 I can't wait to be home so i can see all my friends. when i get back i am going to play frisbee on Friday, Saterday i am going to go see Joesph at Village theater, Sunday i am going midnight bowling. man the weekend is going ot be great. just like the good old days... well for a little bit that is because Anna.Liz, and Pam are leaving the next week after that. well the short dream well at least will last for a little bit.

The drive might be really really long, but i am stoping in like 3 places as of now it should be fun. i think the idea that i want to be home will drive me more then wanting to stay here i think i might feel a little diffrent if i found more friends here but i havn't but what can you do? i met some people on the movie so i hope that hanging out with them tonight goes well.

Speaking of the movie i got so many compliments for my hard work it felt really good knowing that i was appreciated even though i had the bitch job.  but it was fun so who knows maybe i will be back here next summer working again and actrally doing what ia want to do working on moives or theater. well that is all i have to say right now. i will try to update later when i have time i work tommorw at like 9 in the morn so i hope i am not to hung over so i dont want to be there, but i am just helping open and hten back to shipment i go i mean we got 42 boxes yesterday and i only got like 5 done it was sad. well i hope all is well.

Lots of Love

"event","i dont'get it everything is the same but diffrent. i don't know why but it is. i come home every now and agian and see peopel that i miss and i think the longer i stay in issy the more i want to everything is ""normal"" here this what i miss being able to go where ever when ever and almost always have someone to be with. yet when i am at CWU i don'tk even think about what i have in Issy and it si the same when i am here i do'nt think about wha ti have at CWU when i am here.but what ever everything changes we all grow up but it is werid watching underclassmen go through what i went through i just don't get it. but what ever what can you do? i ran into Heather at school on thursday and that wasn't that bad i was very suprised i thought it had potential be actrally pretty shitty but i it really wasnt' it was very theriputic.but what ever we made up and we dont' hate eachother anymore ithink we still have the bitterness that we have had but what ever i am over it it will all work out i just hope tha tshe doens't fall inot it like i did. but it will all work out we wil both fnd someone better and be much happier. oh i almost forgot yesterday i got to hang out wiht liz and we were going ot go and play frisbee but thre wasnt any so we went to target it was fun i am happy that she is home i have missed being around her. i also had coffee with pam today that was good as well i have missed her to. but what eve it is all good now we are all here togeather and it is like old times but not. i think we are all feeling the same thing which sucks but what ever life goes on. so i will stop babaling now and i will say peace out

I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must have been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious if you have to ask me why
I say goodbye...

'Cause I am barely breathing
And I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding
Imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting
A fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, worth the price
The price that I would pay

Everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction? I only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

I've come to find, I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe?

I rise above, or sink below
With every time, you come and go
Please don't come and go

Hot summer nights mid July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, the city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in, the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will

Oh that grace, oh that body
Oh that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul
I know you will, I know you will

"event","Been watch a bit of Doctor Who, its not bad but I still trying to figure out if I like it.  Six/seven episodes in and I still not sure, its watchable I guess.  
So I am one year older, my life, its is strange.
If all goes well I should be in Italy in the fall, and I am also in 12,000 in debt.  Yeah that sucks.  
So I am still not with Angel.  I have not stopped loving him so that puts me in bind since he still wants to be with me.  It has been about five months since we broke up and the fact that he still wants to work things out impresses me.  But then again, he is still the douche that told me that he is going to get better with or without me, and that he was not going to wait forever.  
Ass.
Believe me I want him to continue seeking therapy, it was in such a lousy state when I was with him.  I don't know what is wrong with him.  Don't think I ever will find out what was wrong. 
He asked me if we could try to work things out earlier this month, I didn't want to. I don't know if that would be a good idea, I told him I still need more time to think about it.  The truth is that I need more time to repair all the damage he cause and it going to take some time.  He is not going to get better over night and I don't think I can handle him doing this to me again.  
I really don't want to go through all this shit with him again. There is no benefit as far as I can see.   
He can't promise me that things will get better, and he decimated all the hope I used to have for us together.  I am just so destroyed.  Can't he see that there is not much left.  
I am not young anymore. I don't want to go through all this bullshit for nothing. I am just so tried. I don't want to do this anymore.
I love him, but I need more time away from him. I need to fix me. 
I am so broken and he doesn't understand. He probability things I am being unfair.  
I don't think he really cares how his actions made me feel for the past two years. I don't want to go back to that. 
If it means giving up on the one person I have love for the last twelve years, then so be it.  
I am tried Angel, I don't have the heart to keep doing this to myself. 
If you really want me, you'll wait for as long as it takes.  It may even take a year.  If you don't want to wait. Then I don't mean that much to you in the first place.  In the end, you will be saving us both a lot of pain.  
If I am not worth waiting for, then you got the wrong girl.  

Me that one chick."

"event","I have been watching romantic films again, which is something that I am sure is not good for me right now.  Fashion and I are on speaking terms now after almost two years of not speaking to each other.  
I am a little unstable right now. I am not quite sure what to do with myself right now.  What has just donned on me is that this whole time I have stressed how Angel is no good for me, well I just figured out that the same can be true of me.  That is to say that I am no good for Angel either.  It took him years to get me to trust him and now since he dashed well,  it would take more years to fix this.  Angel has shown that he is a unstable partner and who wants to have a child with someone like that.  I was not found of the idea oh having children and it is even worse now.  If we got back together like how he would want to, the whole child thing would be up in the air.  He also finds me lazy, and unreliable, which by the way sucks.  I am not what he wants, I am my own person with my own wants and dreams which do not include children. 
We both have very negative opinions of each other, what happen to loving someone for who they are? Well, that is very hard to do sometimes.  
I don't want to marry Angel. It would be a mistake on both ends.  He was right to doubt us, and I should have ended it sooner.  Do not live in fear of getting hurt again, because you will get hurt again. Everyone does not have a perfect somebody for them. It was naive of me to think that way. People are ugly stupid creatures, everyone is ugly inside. 
One has to be a little bit crazy to be happy in this world, lucky for me, that is exactly what I am. 
I dream of a love that is worth the pain.  A love where the good times out weigh the bad.  A love in which I do not have to spend the bulk of it wondering ""is it me?""  I am not perfect, no one is.  It is not as if I expect it, I just thought that being decent was something that was not that hard to be.  People however have a wonderful way of disappointing me.  
I am stubborn, childish, overweight, bitchy, lazy, fiery temper when I allow myself to come to a boil, dependent on others, and lacking in ambition. 
I am giving to a fault, loving to a fault, enabling to a fault, devoted to a fault, and can be docile to a fault.  
28 years and my life is just beginning, it may not impress Angel, but it doesn't need to.  
Going to dance with myself"

You tell me that you miss me, but in the end you wouldn't let me touch you.  How much rejection and pain you have cause, do you not think I have suffered enough? You are alone, you do not wish to trust your family and your friends have always been shit.  They never really cared about you, I knew this for a long time.  Those people whom only wanted used you, those are the people you choose over me.  Now you see that they don't care and you are lost, but still stay with them.  You choose shit instead of love, you deserve them. We could have been a family, you ruined everything. How dare you come to me, you think just with a sorry, it would fix everything.  You say 'I said I was sorry, now get over it, its no big deal.'  Oh yes, the one who causes the pain is so keen on forgetting and moving on.  But what about me? Do my feelings mean so little to you that all the years of hurt should just be over looked with an ""I'm sorry.""  I want to hate you, but I find that so hard to do even now.  I loved you so much, and love you still but you are not worthy of being loved by me.  It may take me years but I will move on with my life.  I so wanted to make a home with you, but you ruined it! I suffer because you are an uncaring asshole! I was there for you, and you pushed me away.  I was foolish to believe that someone who could not even make himself happy could bring any joy to another. If all goes well I will be gone in six months, and if I learn to live on my own, I will leave.  I will move out of your reach, and hope never to see you again.  I have been too kind to you, you know this.  You are a liar, a coward, a manipulator, insensitive SOB.

"event","It has gotten to the point where I am thinking about the good times and not all the reasons as to why I broke up with Angel in the first place.  Mommydearest tells me that this will pass and then I will feel nothing. My cousin whom was cheated on believes that Angel was cheating on me, I told her I have no proof of this.  She asked me what I believe and I said that I don't think so, but hell I could be wrong.  It's not like he was incapable of doing it, he is a selfish and stupid kind of guy.  From what my cousin has been telling me, Angel sure as hell sounds like he was cheating on me.  I had asked if he had/was after the break up but he insisted that he had been faithful to me.  My answer at the time was ""I don't except you to be honest about this ever."" He wanted to continue the relationship with me so I doubt that he would confess such a thing at that moment.  If he was it would sure as hell make this getting over him a lot easier.  But all I have gotten from him since we broke up is that he misses me and wants to make amends for the pain that he caused.  Yes nice sentiments, you know when they could have been useful, six months ago.  Better yet, a year ago when I asked you to get counseling, or how about after making me cry, again, and again, and again for all those months.  Mommydearest tells me that he did not realize my value till I was gone.  How about he didn't realize my value after he found out that none of his friends gave a shit about him.  Oh that I was the only one that kept putting up with his shit and loved him even after he was so distant with me.   He ruined us by behaving like an asshole.  I have given him too many chances and way too much of my time, I can not do this anymore.  I have to move on.  I can't be stupid anymore hoping that he will be better next time around.  If he really cared about me and my feeling, our relationship, he would have gotten help a long time ago.  Not just wait till I leave him.  I love Angel so much, but he is just a bad person for me.  He is no good, and that will never change because it has not in the twelve years that I have known him.  Every time he has come back, that I have let him back into my life, there are promises that it won't be like the last time.  It may have been four/five years but god how he likes to fuck things up with me.  
You have had you last chance with me Angle.
You ruined it, get better for yourself.  Hopefully you don't fuck over your next relationship the way you did with ours.  
My answer is no, and it is going to stay 'NO'
You had countless of chances with me, and you manage to fuck up each and everyone of them.  You are going to have to live with the consequences of your actions. 
May you be happy one day, as I hope to one day be.

I dumped my boyfriend after things weren't working out for a few months, then he tells me he was thinking about marrying.  Apparently he got scared and I have to deal with the fact that my boyfriend of four years could not see himself working out with me long term.  Oh but he says that he will always love me.  Great! What am I supposed to do with that information? 
This and finals
I am just so tried, I have not had enough sleep for a while now, I am sad and lonely every now and then.  It erks me to have to think about how one day I will have to start all over again with someone new.  This is bullshit.
I have my whole life ahead of me, but right now I am not feeling so good.
I have so much to look forward to next year, I graduate and if all goes well I will be living in Italy for about four to five months.  
I have so much to look forward to, but really, right now, I feel really low.  I am so sad sometimes.  
Everyone I know has problems that seem a lot worse then mine. (okay maybe one of them is just young) I just have to hold it in all the time.  No one ever really lets me cry it out, they don't want to see me bawling, but what if a good cry is all I need? Just sit there and pat my head and stay hey ""I know it hurts, its alright, let it go, you are going to be okay"" 
I am pissed, sad, lonely, tried and I get paid very little so I can't even buy myself stuff to make me feel good.  Like really expensive chocolates, sweet wines, movies, fancy clothing, you know shit I really don't need.  
The only way I cheer myself up is making other people smile.  I make jokes (they are not good ones) I act silly, bring candy and cookies to work.  I fine it easier to spend on others than myself. 
Just really over it, not this year, but just how I am.

"event","I sometimes wonder if I choosing the right career, the right profession. 
*my thoughts earlier were more clear I just wanted to rewrite thoughts I just had*
God that sounds bad.  Can't even write a sentence correctly.  My brain is fried.  
Well since I really can't remember what it was I was thinking word for word, and damn it, it was a lot more intelligent sounding than this post, I am going start fresh.  
So like I was saying, there reason I am questing my current major choice is because I find that I am inadequate. I find that I don't think like my fellow peers, my writing and thinking process seems to always fall short.  I really don't know what to do with myself as of late.  No, my feeling about art and it's history has not changed, I just find myself falling behind because I don't care to question convention.  My peers are brimming with questions and research topics, I am just happy to learn about the works.  A speaker today stated at a true art historian always has questions.  I am at the stage where I only want answers.  
I once told one of my teachers, that I am blank book, I continue to go to school to attain knowledge.  It has past that point for most of my peers, most of them are graduates, I am just learning the methodologies that come with the field.  I just feel so frustrated with myself at this point.  As if I am not learning fast enough.  
It is like a voice inside myself saying ""I know I can be great, just provide me with the information/knowledge to get there.""  
Am I just not getting it?
I find that I do not read in to things as much as my peers, whom see complex theories where I only see an argument.  I see a image I get; lines, colors, movement, emotion; my peers get; the struggle of black artists in Latin American culture.  
The fact of the matter is, I just don't see it.  
I don't think that way and it frustrates the hell out of me!
I don't get modern/contemporaneity art.
I see new works, and I might find them nice to look at, get the concept behind the work, but still do not consider/see why it is seen as art.
I am so pissed off right now
If I can't see it as art, what am I doing here?
What is the point of working for a museum where I care nothing for the work it holds?
I am so pissed off right now
With myself and with these works, and this stupid, uncomfortable desk! 
It hurts my arms working on this thing!
It is not enough that I show of for class, do all the assignments, and pass the course, I will never succeed this way.  
I must stand out, right I do, but not in a positive way.  I must be better than my peers, my thinking has to surpassed theirs.  These are my competition in this field and I am still all over the place.  I do not have organized thoughts, I am all emotion and no thought.  
Why don't I get it? 
Why do I hate it?
I love my classes, learning is amazing! Just that every teacher asks for my writing each week, and each week I fall short.   
Passable, forgettable that is all I am right now. 
Hard working, but a ditz.
Would write more but this table is really hurting my elbows and its really pissing me off! 
Fuck y'all!"

"event","I find myself talking a lot about myself (likes, thoughts, random stuff) these days.  I really dislike it, but I am having a hard time controlling myself when it happens.  It's like my brain is set on ""ME"" and sometimes even I get annoyed with my lacking of giving a shit about other people's opinions/thoughts.  I've caught myself doing this a few times, I don't know what has triggered this ""Me"" fest.  I feel really stupid for doing this.  I want to stop but I just word vomit all over the place sometimes.  I got to tell myself to shut up when I am with others, or someone might just have the guts to do that for me.  That would be really embarrassing, especially because I think I would deserve it. 
This is my journal so here is does not count.  Who in the hell have I been hanging out with that had me think it's okay to ignore what a person just said and talk about myself?
That is a really bad habit I am getting in to.  
Quick news
Still with Angel
Cat is still alive
Still talking to Spanish Bible 
Going to a 4 year college and working on my BA in AH
Still not speaking to Fashion
Still getting pissed off at myself for not being a better person
Still hoping to better myself in time.

How long has it been since I wrote in a journal? 
I am in love and I'm scared
I am finally working on my AH BA
I like my job/I have a job
Why do I feel like things are going to come crashing down on me?
I must be good, I must wish good for others, I have to stop talking crap about people (it has been really hurting my soul, and it makes me a ugly person) I can feel the ugly sometimes when I'm talking shit.&nbsp; I don't want to be that person, I want to be better.&nbsp; I want a good clean soul.&nbsp; I want to be a person my niece can be proud of.&nbsp; I do not want to be like my sister.&nbsp; I want to be good.&nbsp; Happy, responsible, and not an over all disappointment.&nbsp; 
I must learn to stand on my own, with my lover or without him.&nbsp; I want to show myself that I can be on my own.&nbsp; 
I wish to be more grateful for all the opportunities given to me.&nbsp; For all the favors, gifts, lessons given to me. 
I am your servant, I come before you humbled&nbsp;
I must not fail, for if I do I would be failing myself
Please forgive my arrogance, as I hope to one day forgive myself.&nbsp; I have been cruel without reason, selfish, stubborn and ungrateful, weak, all this and more.&nbsp; I wish to be forgiven though I do know that I have not earn it.&nbsp; I want to be happy with myself, and thank you for all the obstacles that have put in my way to making me the person I am today.&nbsp; I know I have much to grow.&nbsp; I am open to growth.&nbsp; I welcome it, and fear it at the same time. This is my open letter to fate, destiny, or any other name for what drives the line which I follow. &nbsp;
Forgive me, as I will try to do for myself.&nbsp; Forgive yourself Lilly, Myrtle, BB Kitty, Duck, you are still just a child, but now you must act like as a woman.&nbsp; 
Love yourself for who you are, accept what you can not change and change what you can not accept.&nbsp; 
Corny I know, but it is true.&nbsp; 
Remember we learn more from our failing than our triumphs
so ends this rant

I'll just tell you what I really don't mind sometimes. The farting in his sleep I really don't mind...unless it the smelly kind LOL! His childish behavior can be cute sometimes. We are both really stubborn and it works against us most of the time. He makes me laugh at times, and when he's not being an ass gives in to me. 
When he's in a good mood he lets me walk all over him, which I know is for me to do, but I do it anyway. I can make near unreasonable demands and he'll treat me. He is still in debt Partly because he spending on me. Although i do think he gets confused between I want more; sometimes a kiss and hug mean ten times more than a expensive gift. 
I don't what else to say right now."

What is this about you may ask....well nothing really.
I wanted to chat for a bit, but really had nothing to say.
So I will talk to you about myself then.
I am now 25 years old, I still live with my parents. I have no job.&nbsp; I don't drive.&nbsp; I don't watch much television. I don't read as much as I should. And I just passed my English class :D.
I don't really know how to cook.&nbsp; I took a pottery class this year and had lots of fun.&nbsp; 
I have been with this one guy for about seven months straight, which is a record with this guy. 
Well I got nothing else to say for now. I am not feeling so bad about myself, that is why I don't update this thing as much as I use to.&nbsp;"

Some guy gave me his number (because I would not give him mine). He dance with me most of the night and the last song before the club owners kicked us out :D.&nbsp; He kept telling to call him on Saturday, but that not going to happen.&nbsp; He was good looking but I am just not ready to be dating again.&nbsp; He slipped me a kiss LOL!&nbsp; On the cheek :P.&nbsp; But he was going for my mouth.&nbsp; I gave a kiss on the cheek to calm his ass down lol! He was all touchy fee-ly on the dance floor.&nbsp; Kept putting his arms around me.&nbsp; Bringing closer to him every now and then.&nbsp; And boy was he persistence! Well it's nice to know that boys want me :D.&nbsp; It felt good to have someone want to be near me.&nbsp; Means I still got it! So when I am really to start dating it won't be so hard to find someone to ask me out :D
Spanish Bible took me there for a friends birthday party but there was some drama and the birthday girl left early.&nbsp; We met up with her friend Blue Shoes and we all dance together for a while :D.&nbsp; However, Spanish Bible had men calling on her throughout the night *wink wink.&nbsp; Me and Blue Shoes where left to dance on our own for a little while.

Myrtle: But. What if he is the one for you? Please don't do anything stupid.&nbsp; You guys are just in a slump right now because you can't see each other that's all.&nbsp; STRONG RELATIONSHIPS CAN GET PAST THIS! Don't give up so quickly! You two still love each other right? Isn't that worth fighting for?
BB Kitty: Fuck that! She is just the rebound girl! Fuck face is just starting to realize that. Do you really think he's gonna stick around after he figures it out?&nbsp; If he does it's only out of guilt for putting her through all of this shit and lying to her.&nbsp; She has been the rebound bitch for the last SEVEN years!

But I will get over it.&nbsp; Just as soon as I stop crying.&nbsp; It was the right thing to do.&nbsp; Seeing a problem ahead of time and knowing there is nothing you can do about and just staying together till it go worse would have been a bad choice Logically. So if all this is true why am I still in a hell of a lot of pain? Why do I keep thinking that if I just asked him to stay till it go worse it would have been worth it? Why does my heart ache every time I think about him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well you just called it off with the guy you've loved since you where seventeen, that could one reason.&nbsp; Another would be that even though you were happy with him, and you both loved each other it was not enough to keep you two together.&nbsp; That you illusions of love are just that, illusions and that the reality is love does not conquer all.&nbsp; Or that you still feel in some way that either of you could have worked through these problems had you just tried instead of giving up on them before they get bad like you two always do. How about the fact that you two have never really giving your relationship a chance since at the first sign of real trouble you both jettison the relationship and try to move on because it is much easier that way for the both of you.&nbsp; That neither of you wants to take full blame for the relationship's failure.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't feel so good.&nbsp; But writing helps me with my thoughts and look I stopped crying. <br />Could it be that now after all of this you feel dead inside? Or is this just another way of you staying &quot;I give up&quot;?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's too late now, my pride will not let me go any further. It is over, and that is just it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will get over it, and I must move on.&nbsp; That is what I wanted right just to move on and get over the past.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you two ever going to try this again? <br />I do not think so.&nbsp; It feels like it now but I am sure that it's over now. We'll each get married and have kids with someone else. And he will be happy and so will I.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, if you say so.&nbsp; But are hurting like hell in the meantime.&nbsp; You still want to be with him. You still love him like crazy.&nbsp; You two are so stupid it makes me sick. I just would have gone down with the ship.&nbsp; And watch it sink, fuck being on good terms I would have wanted passion over logic.&nbsp; Fuck logic, love has nothing to do with it.&nbsp; You were just too scared to sit it out, both of you are so stupid.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would have ended anyway we would have just been wasting each other's time.<br />So what? You have always done this, you reason you way out of pain because you are so scared of losing.&nbsp; This is why it never works out, you never meet people half way on things.&nbsp; You can't change and you don't want to change so everyone else must be the problem. You never finish anything anymore. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am in so much pain. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> <table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" border=""0""><tbody><tr bgcolor=""#000066""><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><font size=""2"" face=""arial"">I know you think that I shouldn't still love you<br />I'll tell you that<br />But if I didn't say it<br />Well, I'd still have felt it<br />Where's the sense in that?<br /><br />I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder<br />Or return to where we were<br /><br />Well I will go down with this ship<br />And I won't put my hands up and surrender<br />There will be no white flag above my door<br />I'm in love and always will be<br /><br />I know I left too much mess<br />And destruction to come back again<br />And I caused but nothing but trouble<br />I understand if you can't talk to me again<br />And if you live by the rules of &quot;It's over&quot;<br />Then I'm sure that that makes sense<br /><br />Well I will go down with this ship<br />And I won't put my hands up and surrender<br />There will be no white flag above my door<br />I'm in love and always will be<br /><br />And when we meet<br />As I'm sure we will<br />All that was then<br />Will be there still<br />I'll let it pass<br />And hold my tongue<br />And you will think<br />That I've moved on<br /><br />Well I will go down with this ship<br />And I won't put my hands up and surrender<br />There will be no white flag above my door<br />I'm in love and always will be<br /><br />Well I will go down with this ship<br />And I won't put my hands up and surrender<br />There will be no white flag above my door<br />I'm in love and always will be<br /><br />I will go down with this ship<br />And I won't put my hands up and surrender<br />There will be no white flag above my door<br />I'm in love and always will be</font><br /><br />"

Me and Angel are having problems.&nbsp; One thing I won&rsquo;t change and me scared that he has no changed at all.&nbsp; He can be so stupid at times, then again, so can I.&nbsp; Being physically close does not mean that emotionally you are ready to handle this relationship.&nbsp; We were close today, I felt nothing while we were making out.&nbsp; It did not fix anything, I just went along with it because I thought it would&nbsp; make things better.&nbsp; I though it would fix things and make him happy. But it didn&rsquo;t fix anything. I was not even in to it, I was else where.&nbsp; At the end of it all I felt more alone.&nbsp; If this is the way we fight it is fall more fucked up than yelling at each other.&nbsp; I want to make things better, I want things to be like they were in the beginning. But I still don&rsquo;t trust him and he knows it.&nbsp; What can I do about it? He says that I don&rsquo;t respect him, I tried to explain it to him.&nbsp; In the end he just does not understand me and secretly I wonder if there is someone out there who does.&nbsp; I keep thinking it&rsquo;s going to end and I will find someone who really loves me.&nbsp; A part of me wants to let go of Angel and go looking for love else where. It is almost like somewhere in my head is says to keep looking, this one is not the one.&nbsp; What if my true love is still out there? I don&rsquo;t think I have experienced enough yet to put all my hopes and dreams in to one basket.&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s what really bothering me, that I have not been around enough. I have only had two lovers in my whole 24 years of life, is it bad of me to want more then just two at least three would be nice.&nbsp; How does it feel like to kiss a girl? How another mans body feels&nbsp; like?&nbsp; What does it feel like to make love to a girl?
If you want to know so much then why are you with Angel? Or are you just using him till you move to your new school to find said lovers?
I love Angel.&nbsp; But Angel &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; he loves me, I don&rsquo;t believe that he is too sure whether or not he really loves me. 
Do you want to get married?
Yes, I really do want to get married.
Do you want to marry Angel?
A part of me wants to, but I am just so scared that he will never ask me and just leave me.&nbsp; He talks about it like he one day will but the dumb fuck has not even asked me to be his girlfriend.&nbsp; He keeps going about &ldquo;if I ask you now you&rsquo;ll just say no&rdquo; NO you dumb fuck.&nbsp; Just ask me on you own! Of course I&rsquo;ll say no after that! That is a total mood killer. It makes me want to say no, you stupid dumb fuck! I love you why can&rsquo;t you understand that in it self is a yes.&nbsp; Just ask me. &nbsp;
Do you hate him?
I hate what he is making me become.&nbsp; I hate the person I am with him.&nbsp; The jealous girlfriend. I hate the way I am acting.&nbsp; It makes me want to leave him. Alone I don&rsquo;t act like this, I don&rsquo;t really care as much, he&rsquo;s not mine to control. &nbsp;

"event","I don't know what to do any more. I am so scared.&nbsp; What if I am making a mistake by going out with Angel?&nbsp; Everyone keeps telling me to let him go. I feel so bad. I hate the idea of them being right and having him hurt me again. I can't seem to get over that thought that he'll just up and leave me one day.&nbsp; Or worse be cheating on me with random girls.&nbsp; I still don't trust him.&nbsp; Mommy Dearest keeping telling me love does not last forever when the money runs out.&nbsp; She, my sisters, cousins everyone who loves me wonders if I'm doing the right thing.&nbsp; Funny thing is that they all swear that if Angel ever hurts me again (which is possible) that they will: Mommy Dearest: Kill him if its the last thing she ever does, Angry Teen: hunt him down, Cousins: Egg his car/house and slash his tires, Wolfie: beat the crap out of him, Pinkgoth: run him down with her car.&nbsp; Some of these are funny, but out of all of them my mother and Wolfie were the most serious about it.&nbsp; Not one of them wants to see me suffer like I did before because of him.&nbsp; 
I just don't know what to do.&nbsp; A part of me is always telling me just to leave him, forget about him and look for real love, and if not that then just someone who can and will take care of me.&nbsp; I know everyone thinks Wolfie is a better choice, believe me I know so myself.&nbsp; Then why do I waste my time with Angel if Wolfie is a much better choice.&nbsp; Beats me.&nbsp; At times like these I feel really stupid. Everyone is just waiting till I learn my lesson once and for all.&nbsp; Mommy Dearest thinks that Angel comes from bad blood, that since his mother cheated on her husband (I told my older sister and she told mother) and that his father does like to work (I don't know where she got this from I never said anything like that) that Angel will be just like them. I really don't know about the work, and I already don't trust him to be faithful to me already. 
So why I am with a man I do not trust? Why stay until he hurts me? Wolfie one the other hand is sweet, honest, hard worker, and he likes me. I just feel so bad that I do not love him. I know he could take really good care of me. That his family is the sweetest people I have ever met. And I don't really believe Angel when he tells me that he loves me, and I don't really thing I love him anymore.&nbsp; There is some thing there, when will I get over it? I want to be rid of all this.&nbsp; Right now I want to leave him, it just seems to be bringing me nothing but pain being with him.&nbsp; 
I don't kids right now. He wants them. Let that be the deal breaker.&nbsp; Call it off. Get you tubes tied. But what if I want a brat later in life?
Do you really want one? You really do hate kids.&nbsp; You hate having to take care of them. Hate being around them for too long. Hate the idea of giving birth. Hate being fake around them. But you don't want people to dislike you. But YOU REALLY HATE KIDS.&nbsp; When they touch you, play with your hair, it sickens you.&nbsp; You can't stand other people's kids. You will never love kids that are not from you own blood. You only love Kitty Cat because she is your blood, and she comes from someone so dear to you.&nbsp; But you will NEVER LOVE those kids Mari. He might let you play with them a few times this year but you will never really care for them. They will always mean nothing to you and that will eat him inside.&nbsp; If I ever get knocked up by Angel I will have the child but I will take it away from him. Even leave the country if I have to and raise it on my own. Anything thing that comes out of me is MINE. It shall carry my name and my blood.&nbsp; But! And this is a big but.&nbsp; I may not want children but if anyone tries to take one away from me I will fight toot and nail for it.&nbsp; I'll ask Wolfie to marry me (so that I may have a stable home for the baby)and raise the child as his own(only if wants to otherwise I'll see what I can do).&nbsp; I will do just about anything to keep it for myself. 
Everyone thinks Angel is two-faced, even a part of me thinks that too.&nbsp; I can't shake the feeling that he will cheat on me any day now, or if he has already done it. I just can't trust him I feel like he lying to me sometimes. That is not normal.&nbsp; He tries acting like I'm the only one in the world for him, but you see that is just it, what if it's just an act? What does he want from me then?&nbsp; I want to break it off. It's the lying bit, I know, somewhere I know he's lying to me, I just don't know about what.&nbsp; His chick friends, I don't like it.&nbsp; Still talking to girls he's fucked, it really pisses me off. I don't think its right. I don't think it right for him to be doing favors for his ex-girl friends. It makes me want to cheat on him. I just want to go out fuck some random guy to to get even so to speak.&nbsp; I even had thoughts of banging Wolfie just to make myself feel better. It's just not right and I even had talks to him about the ex girls thing but...he's lying to me I know it. He tries playing off the ""I'm just trying to be nice"" guy thing and it smells of bullshit. I know he still talks to them.&nbsp; ""I'm just trying to be nice."" Yeah right! 
So far he wants me to met all his ""friends"" I really don't know what that is all about.&nbsp; I don't like it.&nbsp; The guys seem alright with me but I feel that the girls will want to compete with me and that is something I don't like. Like that fat bitch I was trying to be nice to. She was fucken pissed at me.&nbsp; Well fuck her, he tried talking to me about her again FUCK that I don't give a rats ass about her anymore. She was a bitch to me so she no longer is of any importance and if he doesn't like it well fuck him too.&nbsp; Some how I feel that most of them will be the same to me.&nbsp; I don't want to deal with their shit.&nbsp; I will not be disrespected. IF they want a fight bring it on. But you see all the problems Angel brings me. I just don't to deal with him and all this shit.&nbsp; He wants me to make some 19 year old. I really don't want to go. He saids he really wants me there but for what? What in the fuck am I suppose to do at some chick's baby party? 1: I don't care about people. 2: I don't care about kids 3:I don't know anyone there 4: Out of my comfort zone. 5: I really don't want to go and waste my time sitting around while Angel catches up with the breeder. 
I don't want to go, I don't trust him, I want to call this off, THEN WHY IN THE FUCK ARE YOU STILL GOING OUT WITH HIM?
This is where the stupid factor comes in. I don't know. I hate feeling this way. I really want to call it off. So bad. Why can't he just leave me alone? This is hurting me so much. And not just me but the people who love me. I can't stand this anymore.
Mari: but what if he is the one?
Is he really worth it? Has he done anything that makes up for what he did? 
Mari: he broke my heart.....
He will break it again if you let him. Is he really worth have you be broken again? Do you remember how long it took you to get over that pain? Are you willing to go through all that again just for this guy?
Mari:....no....
So is he really worth it?
Mari:............no...........
Will he ever make up breaking you heart?
Mari: no
So why don't you end it?
Mari: A part of me believes that he will make it up to me, that he has changed for the better, that he won't hurt me again. That he has grown up since then.
Are you lying to yourself?
Mari: It's hope, thats not a lie
Which are you filled more with? Doubt or hope? 
Mari: doubt...
So I ask you again, is he really worth the pain you are going through now?
Mari. no
So what are you going to do?
Mari: call it off. 
Why?
Mari: Because he can never make me happy so long as I doubt him.
What about the deal you made with him, till the end of the year, or was it his birthday?
Mari: I stay because he keeps bring that up. I feel that if I call it off right now that he'll just find another girl and it will end everything. And there I lost my chance. 
Now you are being stupid. If he finds some one else that soon that means that you meant nothing to him. That he was lying to you this whole time about loving you. That he was just playing with you. 
Mari: yeah I don't want to know that. It would hurt too much. I would die. I don't want to find out that it was all lies. That is what really keeps me here. I don't don't want to find out that it was all a lie. That I meant nothing to him in the end, that he was just using me like he has always done again. 
Leave him, Leave him now. There is nothing for you here understand that and make him understand that too. Your mistrust is too great to be ignored. Tell him that you will most likely never get over his betrayal of you trust and love.&nbsp; Your love was too pure and innocent to recover from such a blow. 
Mari: what if he still won't me go....?
He will have to prove his love with out getting feedback from you. That is how it should have been done. Be strong Mari. Force a line between you too, if he truly does love you then he will not cross it.
Mari: I still don't trust him.
Then there is really nothing he can do to fix what is broken, end it then."

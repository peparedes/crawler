"event","1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says: 
""I wasn't thinking about God much, except that when I was stoned I felt a mystical sense of peace and expansion...""

2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch?: 
A chocolate-scented candle, a gift from my secret sister.  Worth noting might be that I like to watch the crazy ants flock to it, pause, then meander away dispiritedly.  Also worth noting is that sometimes I, too, wish it were the real thing.

3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?: 
I haven't watched TV in over 2 months.  Wow.  That's a first.  I bet everything will be shown in 3D by the time I get back to the states.

4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is: 
Time to get out of my wet bathing suit.  What am I, a sucker for a UTI?

5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?: 
3:57pm

6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?: 
The purr (and rattle) of an ancient A/C unit and ""Canary in a Coalmine"" - The Police.  Parenthetically, I'll mention that this song is better kept to the airwaves and left off my Visa.  Some songs belong in the surfing realm, where magic and music collide to bring unexpected gifts to your eardrums.  So, as a rare play, it rocks. But anyone else find themselves $0.99 to the nth degree in on their statements, and experiencing a tinge of regret when a song you used to raise your lighter for in celebration results in a blatant eye roll?  

7: When did you last step outside? what were you doing?: 
Nearly two hours ago, when I sat on the stoop eating lime marshmallows and blowing kisses to my students as their ride home (to modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah) pulled away.

9: What are you wearing?: 
Swimsuit; shorts; towel; Trini-sandles; sunglasses

10: Did you dream last night?: 
Nights of late are dreamless.  But pre-REM, I felt earthquakes.  Yeah, we had another one yesterday.  I wish someone had warned me. 

11: When did you last laugh?: 
Playing ""keep-away"" in the pool with my little rascals.

12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?: 
A calendar from Fai's Chinese Restaurant; a rust-and-lime colored floral wreath; a World Map

13: Seen anything weird lately?: 
On Sunday, I drove by a statuesque billy goat on top of a large pile of gravel.  I chuckled and shook my head while the goat stared back inquisitively.

14: What do you think of this quiz?: 
It's a GREAT waste of time (sans sarcasm, I promise).  

15: What is the last film you saw?: 
I made my boys watch ""The Muppet Movie"" today - they hated it.

16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?: 
I'd buy an orphanage AND a dermatologist.  Simultaneously.

17: Tell me something about you that I don't know: 
I am deathly afraid of myself.

18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?: 
I would implant an overwhelming and lasting sense of compassion and responsibility for others into each human spirit.  

19: Do you like to dance?: 
Avec Plaisir!

20: George Bush: 
""Right-wing"" is not right by me.  But beyond that, I have to think (perhaps audaciously, these days) that somewhere out there exists a better candidate for the leader of the free world.  If you are that person, STEP UP NOW.

21: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?: 
Giordana; Meriam; Mara; Lidia; Camilla; Talitha; Silvia 

21: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?: 
Noah; Paolo; Paul; Peter

22: Would you ever consider living abroad?:  I've been in Trinidad since the end of June, save a quick trip home in August.

"event","Q: What is the absolute for uber-insane?

A: Last night.


After grunting ""no!"" and karate chopping people in regards to their weekly chants of ""Let's go out,""  I reluctantly conceded.  So sue me if I'd normally choose curling up with Jerry, forcing ice cream and chick flicks down his throat.  It's just that...well, people can be real dicks sometimes.  So why not avoid them?  Just SOME of the time, times when you're feeling particularly vulnerable and may just fly off the handle if someone were to accidentally squeeze your behind.  Those are the times to enjoy the company of loved ones and leave the rest of the world to frolic.

Last night, though cranky due to lack of dinner, I felt pretty on top of things and thought it proper to join in on the festivities surrounding Dorie's birthday.  The gala was hosted by none other than the antithesis of Dorie....her mother. Complete polar opposites do not a fun party make.  Nevertheless I survived, chugging my Guinea beer, exchanging glances with the boy and itching to move onto the next round.

The next chosen venue was a pleasant surprise...Evos in Lowell.  Many images are conjured at the thought of an evening spent in Lowell.  What basis did I have for my preconceived notions?  

1) High Crime Rate
2) Strange museum visited during school field trip
3) Miraculous receipt of diploma at Tsongas Arena
4) Loch Ness Hockey Monsters
5) Sketch Masters in parking lots
6) Folk Festival

Navigating down the Connector, I realized the injustice of my judgment.  I also realized that I am sometimes my mother's daughter(a very uncomfortable illumination).  And so, shaking off the cold and the rest of my pride, I stepped out of the car and onto the cobblestone streets.  Thank God for my warm coat and semi-practical shoes!  En route we lost Kerri, the embodiment of that woman we've all met at one time or another: the woman on the prowl.  The woman on the prowl can be a kind person and a good friend.  But more often than not, she is a devious android and a good enemy.  Drunkard Beware.

"event","Boston sports teams are like men in relationships:

The Patriots are like the new boyfriend that you really like- he's awesome 
but almost too good to be true, so you worry.

The Bruins are like the guy that you just casually dated and you don't 
really care about him, he's just something to do.

The Celtics are like the marriage that was great at one time but has lost 
its spark and you always kinda look back and think about how great it was.

And the Sox are the hard core abusive husband who just absolutely beats the
shit out of you, but day after day you always go back to him cause you 
always believe that tomorrow will be different and you just love him too 
much.



*My guess is that this piece was written by a witty woman with a knack for encouraging unhealthy relationships.  She most likely grew up in Chelsea where she received a less-than-par education, thus falling short in the way of a good sentence.  Waste of talent, wouldn't you agree?  I know, it's not her fault that her daddy left her and her pregnant mother to fend for themselves.  She should have gone to Bunker Hill in pursuit of a life outside of the Combat Zone.  But in the end, anyone can see: this townie is LOYAL, and she sure does love that dirty wataaah.)"

This was the ultimate spa experience.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is on the verge of losing it, is losing it, or has completely lost it.  I guarantee that you'll be on the way to finding it, if you'll only stop there for a few hours.  I also guarantee that it will break the bank and your left boob will pop out of your robe.  

You will soon be convinced that you deserve it 'cause you're worth it(not the boob thing, the bank thing).  You will have psycho blah blah analysis during your facial, gratis.  But bear in mind, no tolerance is given for one who has a case of ""the tickles"" during massage time with Leslie.  She's no nonsense...and she's also the best.

Expect a treatment that smells like heaven, followed by one that smells like low tide at Revere Beach on a hot August day.  Hold your nose and trust them, they know what they're doing. 

Well versed in all things indulgent, the friendly staff will walk you through your day of beauty with ease.  Silence your cell phone and strip tease in the locker room, then jump into a flimsy cotton wrap and just-your-size slippers.  Relax in the quiet zone with herbal teas and spring water.  Crawl under the covers in your private room and prepare to drift into bliss.  Your body will thank you for it.

My visit to Utopia would not have been realized without the generosity of my boyfriend, who was so fed up with my whining that he needed to get me away from him for a few hours. Thanks schnookums, you're the bombnizzle.  I hope your day of beer and Madden was everything you had hoped for and more."

Let's take it from there, shall we?  The letter H-notorious for being followed by E and double hockey sticks.  Also known for leading the way in such words as ""hock,"" as in ""I need to HOCK a loogie"" ;  ""horrendous,"" typically used in the sentence ""PT Cruisers are absolutely HORRENDOUS"" ; ""Hand me a cerveza,"" ""Hold the pickles,"" ""Help me if you can I'm feeling down and I do appreciate you comin' round,"" and the list continues.

Back it up.  I'm a genius.  
SONGS THAT START WITH THE LETTER H

Help (already been used but absolutely friggin' noteworthy, 1 pt)

Hold my Hand (lame song, but LOTS of H's involved between the song title and artist, 8 pts)

Hard-Headed Woman (2 H's, Excellent tune, 6 pts)

Hello Dolly (for my Jew friends, entertaining musical, 5 pts)

Hold On (overplayed, fabulous decade, performed by a less-fabulous duo, 2.75 pts)

Heaven (good title, used frequently, pleasant associations, 10 pts)

Nobody paddles her boat faster.  Nobody snorkles with more grace.  Nobody shakes her groove thing with more hip.  And NOBODY gives better reason for why the Lambada is known as the ""Forbidden Dance.""  

Here's a typical day at the Riu:

9:30am: Wake-Up

9:45am: Walk of Shame (1 cigarette)

10am: Breakfast(eggs, coffee, 2 cigarettes)

10:30am: Pool/Beach/Swim-Up Bar (3 daiquiris, 4 Mai-Tais, 6 Cervezas, 1 Copacabana, Rice & Beans, espresso, 3 Cuba Libres, 1 water, 10 cigarettes)

3:30pm: Crazy Games/Water Aerobics (2 Cuba Libres, 3 cigarettes)

4pm: 1-Hour Full-Body Aromatherapy Massage

5:30pm: Shower/Dress (2 cigarettes, 2 gin & tonics)

7pm: Dinner (3 Vino Tinto, 1 cigarette, food varies)

8pm: INTERNATIONAL BINGO (4 specials, 4 cigarettes)

9pm: Mini-Disco (2 sambuca chills)

10pm: Show/Karaoke (3 Disaronnos, 4 cigarettes)

12pm: Disco Pacha (2 cigarettes, 5 cervezas, 2 dominicans, baila baila)

4am: Stumble out of Disco with newly aquired group of best friends from Germany/Spain/Rhode Island.  Take lots of snapshots.  Find stretch of sand/empty lounge chair on which to rest spinning head for a few short hours...


So, who's coming with me next year?"

Activity #1: Find suitcase.  Fill with ""resort wear."" GO.

I ran out of trashy Bri'ish novels to read at work.  Any suggestions?  My last resort is to (dear god, no!) focus on some stimulating piece of literature, like Shakespeare or Redbook.  

Activity #2: Hit up B&N. Buy all Red Dress Ink books in stock.

Contrary to my good intentions, frequenting the gym did not become a reality.  Unfortunately, florescent-lit fitting rooms DID.

Activity #3: Search and Destroy all things carbohydrate.  Replace with cigarettes.

What goes up, must come down.  Spinning wheel, round and round.

Activity #4: Write tear-stained letter to Daimler-Chrysler.

This is my brain.  THIS is my brain off drugs.  Any Questions?

"event","Let's wrap it up, kids!  The week, that is.  I feel like putting this week into a box until I can fully examine and comprehend its contents.  Feel free to join me in the one lovely thing left in this world: BOXATION.  

Materials: Heavy-Duty Refridgerator Box, Duct Tape, Will Power, Toothpick, Rubber Band.

Step 1) Defragmentation of mind clutter.

This is when you run a system defrag of your week (or month or year), just like your computer would.  Scan all files, fill in spaces, and compartmentalize so that information is is easily accessible. 

Step 2) Funk Eradication.

Congratulations!  Your thoughts, experiences and emotions are neatly foldered and filed.  Locate ""Funk.exe,"" also known as ""yourdoom.""  WARNING: This file is corrupted.  It is the place where all your shit, or ""funk,"" has been stored (i.e. anything that is hurtful, confusing, uncontrollable).  Do not attempt to open this file.  Instead, stab in with your handy-dandy toothpick and toss it into the box.

Step 3) Cubical Concentration.

It's almost time to seal it all up.  (But beforehand, I suggest hanging upside down over the open box in order to ensure that your aura has been cleansed entirely.)  Now go ahead and tape the crap out of it (also a good anger resolution tool). 

Step 4) Temporary Detainment

Store your box, along with your insanity, in a place where you will not come across during your daily adventures.  Search and reveal contents only whilst harmony and indominability follow you.


Step 5) Inquisitions and Satisfactions.

Q: Why?

A: The Box Method proves that you can MacGyver your way to emotional purity, hence the toothpick and unused Rubber Band (see materials).  

A: Scanning our heads and hearts promotes health and well-being."

...and that's exactly what I'm not doing.  My nights are now switched around, and thursday night is now monday night, but actually my plans suggest that thursday night will be more of a friday night.  Are you following?  Great.

Up at Endicott with one of my favorite women on this earth, my tried-and-true Kim.  I say that with confidence.  She would rather me say my ""i'm gonna be her bridesmaid kim,"" but that just seems drawn out. 

Either way, we're here and we're good.  We're always good.  We don't know any other way.  We've been stuck in this moment for 10 years.  PRECIOUS.

Goodnight.  My hope is that you are able to, at one moment in your life, experience the comfort of such a night with such a friend."

"event","So here's the Weekend Update, minus Tina Fay and Jimmy Fallon (they declined to be interviewed, but promised to send a T-shirt).  

Girls! Girls! Girls!  The past 3 days have been an extraordinary estrogen-fest, debuting with the ever-popular DevoMac.  Yes, I had the honor of welcoming this lovely lady back to New England...and oh, what fun we had!  Our talks took us back down memory lane, and our actions couldn't help but follow.  Was it satisfying to talk politics over brunch?  Was it comforting to share our frustrations?  Was it embarassing to cruise ""the loop"" with slurpees in our hands and Coolio's beats rattling our eardrums?  The answer to all of this is YES.  And I can't wait to go down to NC for more.

By now one would think that I'd be starving for that Y chromasome; but to assume that, one would be WRONG.  There were more adventures to be had, more secrets to be voiced, more shrill shreaks to be shared. I quickly decided that my best option was to kidnap John's little sister, Linda.  Around and around we went, doing girly things while avoiding the soul-crushing constrictions of budgets, volume control, and highways.  Needless to say, we passed the test with flying colors (i.e I'm broke and deaf with an empty gas tank and a smile).  

And today?  Today I analyzed, internalized, and utilized some of my favorite sayings.  You know that one about how going to church doesn't make you a christian any more than going to a garage makes you a car? Yeah, that was one of them.  I've been sleeping in for WEEKS because of that one!  You can use it too, I give you permission.  No thanks necessary.

(Sigh) Well, it's back to the Geek grind for me.  Have a pleasant tomorrow."

"event","There's an ouch in my back, an ouch in my brain, and an ouch in my heart...and no amount of cd purchases, artistic creativity, or primping seem to assuage it.  

Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking any of those things.  In fact, I am just thilled with aftermath of my attempts to self-medicate.  My shallowness exudes such pride at moments like these...but where in name of all that is expensive is the JOY?

I thought I may have found it in ""Forty Licks.""  But Mick Jagger, I hate to say, does NOT have the answer to life's most pressing questions (and I wouldn't judge you if you're one of those who likes to pretend that he does).  Los Lonely Boys are just as lonely as ever, but BOY do they make me swoon!  Compilations galore, a little Elliot Smith (God rest his soul), Kanye for my soulful side...but no joy, not even pure joy extract.  

Wanna hear something great?  I've actually been trying to get other people's joy to rub off on me.  In FACT, I may even be living vicariously through YOU at this very moment (mmrrwwaahahaha).  

Seriously though, this is all nice and crappy-sounding, but there's much more to be said about where I'm at(and there's really nothing that crappy about it).  

So the moral of today's story is: Even if things are going superbly, it's still really fun to whine."

"event","In order for my soul to remain somewhat accessible during this time of dislocation, I have decided to create a journal.  There have been so many times throughout my writing that I have longed for input to balance the output.  Just my luck, I've found the solution!  The deal is, I bitch and you bitch back.  A sounding board of sorts.  Pretty cool, I'd say.

I'll begin the betting at $100, that I've had a more stressful day than you have.  Any takers?  The office was crazy today, what with that new virus infecting everyone and their mother's computers.  Oh, and how the bullshit ran rampant!  Can bullshit run?  In some worlds I heard it sprints, so I suppose I should count my blessings.  

Blessings count:

The freedom to nurse a cold beer
The agility and speed of my Mable replacement (I swear I can get anywhere in 7 min. flat)
The fulfillment of a bountiful tax refund
The accessability of an eyelash curler on a tired-eyes morning
The lack of office dress code (this comes in handy when you wake up 2 minutes before work)
And, an endless supply of friends with which to share all of this infinite wisdom.

Six.  Not too shabby at all.  Any to add?  My resources of optimism have been depleted.  Feel free to comment, but please, nothing cheesy.  We're talking public access here, and I don't want to ruin my reputation of the ""hard-ass.""  

Sincerely, ME"

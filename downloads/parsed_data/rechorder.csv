Sunday I rode with the scooter kids. What a great day and a nice ride. I had a wicked ""small vegggie bun"" sandwich at la grotta that cost me under 4 buck and it was soooo good!

The camp I was working in Taiwan was intense. The last week I was working up to 14 hours a day, without enough paper for kids to draw on, and flooded classrooms. It was an experience that I won't forget. When I was teaching in the mountain area of Keelong, I had 54 kids in one classroom. It stunk because a lot of 14 year olds haven't realized that they have to start wearing deodorant and bathing everyday. Most of the kids I taught were rad, but not so good at the ol' English. It was cute. Some of them I truley wanted to hit. It's a good idicator to me that I've not got the patience to work with children, or rather, not more than 20 at once. Keelong was beautiful though and so high up that people got nosebleeds and earaches on the way going up. Previous to Keelong, I had been two weeks in Tao Yuan, which is the lamest, dirtiest airport town you've ever seen.  I was teaching 9-11 year olds and they were total darling who drove me insane. ""Miss Erin is going to kill herself if you don't stop playing with that basketball insane"". I lost my voice three times on the whole trip. So much yelling, too many kids, too hot, dirty conditions and not enough resources. I'm so glad to be home.
Japan was interesting.
-stayed with sketchy friend who I've decided isn't really a friend.
-Japan is soooo rad
-stayed with Japanese family in Kyoto and drank beer at the table with papa-san while everyone else in the family cooked us tempura and yakisoba. I love Japanese houses and food and people. So fun.
-went to Nagoya to visit friend. We went to the public baths and got all our dead skin removed by some Korean ladies in their underwears.
-rode my rickety bike all over the place. Japanese bikes are too cool.

So...I can't even think about everything that happened. I'm glad to be home and not hot. I missed wearing sleeves and not having heat rash."

In Gastown, I realize that my light isn't working. I'm riding with no light at 1:30 am. Great. I try a few more blocks before I realize that this could cause my death. It's when I'm fiddling with it on the sidewalk that I realize that my side door is missing....so that's what that crashing sound was. Hmmmm. So....I call my friend who lives downtown, drag him out of bed, put my bike is his parking, go and hunt for the side door (some bouncer at a club had layed it against a tree for me....nice dude), and get a ride home. Oh and wait....I forgot that while I was buzzing my friend to let me into his underground parking, a car nearly flattens my bike while it's parked! Vespas....gotta love 'em! So yeah...put door back on and fix light, and change cable and we're good to go! Happy Friday night!"

"event","Bah!
I just did my mock motorcycle road test. I made lots of mistakes, including not going fast enough on the highway. I feel lame. And, I feel bad for letting my instructor see me feeling lame about myself. Damn.
Ah well, go faster, do shoulder checks to the max! The new motto. The test is on Friday. Oh and thank to BEBBY for the kevlar jacket! Super comfy.
I need a hug."

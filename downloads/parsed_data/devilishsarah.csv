"event","Kathryn, Josh, and I had an eventful late afternoon and evening.  We hit up TUTTO BENE, the absolutely delish Italian coffee place near campus, then hit up HEB (for those non Texans, that's the grocery store), and then had a delicious dinner complete with soft serve ice cream at the University Center.  Yep, that's right, now that Kathryn and I don't have meal plans they have good shit like soft serve.  Whatever, we 'aint bitter!  Anyway, we tooks thousands of pictures...

Ok, so, at Tutto Bene we were reading magazines that they had there and this was an ad that some drew all over and it creeped the shit out of us, just look:

"event","1.  ER made me cry last night, it was SOOOOOOOO GOOD!  Ahh!  This Dad gave his daughter his kidney a few years ago and now it was failing because this drug (that he had been working two jobs to pay for to make her life easier) was bad and was ruining her kidney.  So he got all distraught and asked if he could give her his other kidney and Dr. Carter said no, it was unethical because he'd have to be on dialysis for his whole life.  Then the Dad KILLED HIMSELF and they were able to then take the kidney and give it to the daughter.  So I called my Dad to ask if he'd give me his kidney and he hesitated at answering!  I was all, put MOM on the phone!  I told her and she says she'd give me her kidneys and, if I needed it, her heart.  I was like umm ok I think you love me a little more than is necessary...

2.  I made an oldies playlist and it's all pacific and happy and makes me yearn even more to be living in the 1960's...

3.    Susan and I are having the cutest text message conversation right now!  Ooooh I miss our Israel trip!  Also, today in the hall I kind of walked into this girl and I actually said, OUT LOUD, ""Slicha""!  Not, excuse me, pardon me, sorry, but I spoke HEBREW to this girl.  Oh my gosh I must've looked so dumb.

The only reason I mention it is because the first sentence is so ridiculous: ""<i>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have taken their latest step towards their apparent goal of total world domination.</i>""

5..  Here are three really random pictures...the first is Kathryn watching a movie in my room, doesn't she look all curvy and nice????  The next two I found on Amanda's pics online and they are so so SO cute and from ZBT 80's before we left to go.  So cute.  In the one with just Mimi and I, my legs look so good, huh?

1.  I'm officially starting a petition to Aaron Karo about his ass sucking.  If you'd like to be included, let me know.
2.  Last night frisbee was SO amazing.  Suuuuch a great game.  Mm, LOVED it.  I made THE sickest catch of my life.  I had to run like 1/2 of the length of the field and once I was in the endzone I had to stretch out my left (I'm right-handed) arm and I caught it on the tip of two fingers.  It.was.awesome.  Eric and Audi left before me and when I got back they were waiting for me in Eric's car and wanted to see if I wanted to go to Taco C.  Umm, OF COURSE!  It was SO good.  I was going to order first and the gangsta Mexican guy working there yelled at Eric and Audi to pay for me.  ""She is a laaaady!""  Good times.  I came back and showered and then Audi asked me to come over.  I go over there and he just wanted me to snuggle with him in his bed.  Cutest thing ever.  One day we'll take pics and you can all have proof that the boy actually exists..
3.  Had Italian + Texas Politics today.  The former will be fine because Molly (my professor) loves me and it's easy.  The latter will just suck ass but Kathryn and my favorite person to make fun of is our SI AGAIN!  He was our SI for Politics last sem.  Sweet.

As usual, here are some random things I've been ruminating about lately...
-What's with people who have cell phones that make so much noise when they're putting it on <i>silent</i>?
-Also, why is it so hard for people to, A. Remember to put their phone on silent in class, and, B. Actually get to the silent button once it's ringing in the middle of class?
-Have any of you seen the new Iowa state quarter?  What the fuck is that about and who the fuck is this ""Grant Wood""?  ""Foundation in Education""?  What, they think they can put on their quarter just because there's that annoying as hell standardized test named for their lameass state?  
<font size=""-2"">-Why does every eligible Jewish boy that is perfect for me live hundreds of miles away?</font> <font size=""-2""></font>-Can Snoop Dogg ever have a song without mentioning weed?
-Who else is creeped out every time they see that Bush/Clinton commercial for Tsunami relief?  I wonder what it was like for GHWB to sit there next to the guy who kicked his ass.
-Why can't you ever just have all great professors?  There's always one that's anal or annoying or hella boring.

It's a guy who goes to Poe's grave in the middle of the night every year (for 56 years..well in 1993 his sons started doing it) on Poe's birthday to ""toast"" him.  The best part is he's anonymous, no one knows who he is.  I love it.  So great.  Poe would love it.  Check it out, fools."

I think it's wonderful that celebrities are banding together to raise huge amounts of money so quickly for the Tsunami tragedy.  I'm glad that the regular Joe's of America are doing the same thing.  But it also <b>pisses me off.</b>  Yes, it was a tragedy and 150,000 people died in a matter of hours; I'm not trying to detract from that.  Why are we only concerned with <b>immediate</b> tragedies?  Africa is slowly wasting away from AIDS.  Why aren't we so concerned about that?  What about Sudan?  Ok, anyway, like I said, I'm a cynic.  Agree, disagree, whatever, I still think it's shitty.

I'm going back to school today.  <b>BRITTANY MACK WILL BE A HALF HOUR AWAY FROM ME!!!!!</b>  
I have a friend that I'm not sure if she is still my friend and I'd really appreciate if she'd tell me and if the answer is no I'd also like to know why.  Thanks.

So my Mom gives me a number today at school to call because while I was in Israel someone from the SI department had called and wanted me to call back.  Ok so SI is Supplemental Instruction.  It's like TAs but different.  They're only in classes where there's a high D/F rate.  I call the number and talk to the woman who'd left the message.  So she's going on and on about how much you get paid, the requirements, etc., and basically wants to schedule an interview. 

Lady:  Do you have any questions?
Me:  Umm, yeah, I guess my Mom didn't hear in the message..I'm still unclear for what CLASS this would be for?
Lady:  Oh!  I'm so sorry!  I didn't tell you how we select SI's!
Me:  Uh huh...

The other 1.5 hour was spent with the one and only Rabbi Grumbacher with whom we had Bar/Bat Mitzvah preparation and learned general life lessons huddled in his cozy office with books literally on shelves all the way to the ceiling.  Mr. Wienner had such a Philly accent and was so hilarious.  His daughter, Jenn, was also a riot.  She told us of when she went on her NFTY in Israel trip she got a tattoo of a butterfly on her back (then she showed us) but didn't tell her parents.  The next summer they went to the pool at the JCC when it first opened and she forgot and he saw it and he flipped out and made a scene.  Jenn was just really funny.  This past May she earned her BA from the University of Delaware and wanted to be a pharmacist.

She died in a car accident this morning.

I wasn't even really that close to her but it really makes me think.  It's one of those things, you know?  Car accidents are one of the worst ways to die I think.  So unexpected.  I can't imagine her family right now.  She had a little brother who is probably a freshman or sophomore in high school now.  It's shit like this that makes me believe that fate does exist to a certain extent.  The accident wasn't her fault.  Her boyfriend was driving and he feel asleep at the wheel.  He lived.  It's like why her and not him, HE fell asleep at the wheel.  Thinking about all of this provoked me to write a long email to my Rabbi in Delaware.  I miss him a lot and I hope that when I get married he will perform the ceremony.  He loved Jenn too.  Sad.

Rest in peace, Jennifer.

"event","I usually never post an entire song in my lj but this is an exception.  I am so so so sick of reading about suicide bombings and such in Iraq and reading about how TX has so many deaths in Iraq.  So I'm getting ready to go out and I'm all in this pacific mood so I'm listening to my Bob Dylan playlist (what else is new?) and Masters of War came on and it's exactly what I'm feeling like right now...

""Masters of War"" by Bob Dylan

Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand o'er your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead

""Mankind must put an end to war, or war will put an end to mankind.""
--JFK

<i> An animal rights group filed a complaint Wednesday against a kosher slaughterhouse for alleged cruelty to cattle.</i>
In case you didn't get the memo, PETA, for an animal to be killed in a kosher manner it is to be done so in the most painless way possible.  Contradiction?

<i>PETA's complaint, filed with the U.S. Agriculture Department, called for the prosecution of Agriprocessors Inc. and the Orthodox Union, an international kosher certification agency. </i>

<i>Thomas and other kosher advocates say the slaughtering process, which is regulated and carried out by trained rabbis, is designed to make death quick and painless. 


""It's not aesthetically pleasing. There's an enormous amount of blood loss,"" Thomas said. ""But just because it's not pretty does not mean it's cruel."" </i>

Yeah, like there isn't any blood and gore in non-kosher slaughterhouses?  Please.
Thank you for giving me another reason to hate you, PETA.  I'm going to go eat a hamburger and maybe some bacon too, and wear a leather belt while doing it.  Ok but seriously, guys, I have NO problem with vegetarians and whatnot that PETA supporters tend to be BUT I DO have a problem when they push their beliefs on others.  I don't wave a Big Mac in your face, do I?  So don't try and make me feel inferior for indulging in some animal flesh every once in a while.  Yikes.  You people need to take it down a notch.
From PETA's article on this issue:
<i>Every day, hundreds of animals endure unimaginable cruelty at an Iowa slaughterhouse. Maybe after seeing the fear and pain on the faces of the animals we captured on videotape, you will go vegetarian and persuade family and friends to join you. </i>
So why are you only focusing on the kosher slaughterhouse for your attack and crusade to convert more meat eaters to vegetarianism?  It seems like the issue, from this quote, is simply that killing animals is wrong, and not necessarily killing them in a kosher manner.  What the hell?

""We're asking for a restructuring of our debt. The company is still profitable and has been profitable for 25 straight years. For all the 12 months of 25 years. It's not that we're not making money, it's that we can't cover this half of the mortgage payment. So we're looking to restructure our mortgage payment so we can pay off our creditors,"" Katz said.

Among our activities: enjoying our wealthy relatives feeding us hardcore, shopping at H&M because it's the best store ever, seeing Wicked.  Barrie and Suze and I were maybe going to NYC it up before Birthright but that fell through, whatever.  Adam will be sooooooo fun!  Ahh I'm so excited just thinking about this.  SO EXCITED.

DevilishSarah: ok weird question but have you ever been like sitting there reading a magazine or something and then you're, umm, ""done"", but you're so caught up in the article you just sit there?
DevilishSarah: or is that just me
Adam: ALL THE TIME!!!!
Adam: why are we the exact same person?
Adam: and both cute as hell"

I was doing research last night for my last arugmentative writing paper.  It's on banned books and I came across all of these articles about this book called <u>Nickel and Dimed</u>.  I remembered reading an excerpt from it for sociology and I really liked it so I read the articles.  Long story short it was banned at a bunch of these colleges because it was ""socialist"" or something.  Anyway, it's stupid.  Soooo I email my sociology professor and I was just like, ""Hey Dr. Scholz, I'm in your section 3 1013 class and I came across these articles that I thought you'd find interesting.  -Sarah Weinstein"".  Just checked my email:

Wow, Sarah.  I hadn't heard about this.
 
If you write up a brief paragraph on this article, I can give you extra
credit points for it.
 
Thanks again

OK, so you know what Facebook is, right?  It's like Myspace or livejournal but with colleges.  Ok so I was doing a ""high school search"" where you put in the city, state, high school, and class year and it shows you all of the people fitting that criteria that are on Facebook.  Soooo I was looking at your class at Lake and first I saw Ben Diamond and I was like ahhhh!  So I requested him to add me as a friend (unlike LJ you have to ""confirm"" that you're friends with someone)  THEN I SAW TIM FUCKING POON!!!!!  And look at how hilarious his picture is (sorry it's not bigger but you can't click on someone's profile to see the picture bigger unless they list you as a friend soooo yeah)

"event","For my livejournal faithful out there you all know what the Henderson Herald is.  However, for those that are unfamiliar, allow me to enlighten you.  Spring semester of senior year I had AP United States Government and my teacher was about as Conservative as they come.  He's an old, wealthy, divorced, angry, white man.  In the class I sat with two fellow raging liberal friends, Mia and Bobrick.  We daily engaged with Mr. Henderson a witty banter of political noshing.  Even though he disagreed with us he respected the fact that we actually had our own views instead of most of the kids in our class who simply had regurgitated Republican views of their parents.  Anyway I used to write about him a lot on my lj, funny conversations we'd had and I called it the <b>Henderson Herald</b>.  Well, IT'S BACK.  I emailed him the other day giving him my concession and he wrote back today.  So, without further adieu...

<lj-cut text=""My original email..."">
Homeboy Henderson!
 
Sarah Weinstein here, the student you loved to hate...
 
I would like to officially concede.  Your guy won.  I bet he feels good that he actually did win this time, eh?  Sorry, couldn't resist that one.  I feel like a disillusioned youth but for ever disillusioned young democrat there is a victorious young republican.  I suppose it's democracy at its best, huh?  Even though I voted for Kerry the point is that I voted.  I'm sure you're happy to see the large numbers of young voters coming out.  
 
While I am angry, feel misguided, and generally fearful of what the next four years will bring I disagree with some of my democratic brethren's views.  Yes, I am disappointed and surprised with the vote but this time there's a clear majority.  I felt we had more of a right to be upset with the results of the last election.  Also, I've heard many peers of mine questioning why they voted and remarking that it ""didn't matter"".  This may have held true, like I said, in the last election; however this time, your vote DID matter.  It was a very close election.  It really worries me that my peers are thinking about not voting again just because their guy lost.  Damn liberals.  (Although I'm sure it'd be the same if the results were the opposite.)
 
Don't get me wrong, I'm still very very, shall we say, pissed off that he gets another four years and things like the possibility of the draft, the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act, and the drastic change we will see in the Supreme Court are all things that really worry me.  But like I said, I feel as if it's simply democracy working.  I guess I know what you felt like in 1996 when that smooth talkin' Southerner pulled out another huge win.  I wish the country were more unified.  John Quincy Adams said, 
 
""The indissoluble link of union between the people of the several states of this confederated nation is, after all, not in the right but in the heart. If the day should ever come (may Heaven avert it!) when the affections of the people of these States shall be alienated from each other; when the fraternal spirit shall give way to cold indifference, or collision of interests shall fester into hatred, the bands of political associations will not long hold together parties no longer attracted by the magnetism of conciliated interests and kindly sympathies; and far better will it be for the people of the disunited states to part in friendship from each other, than to be held together by constraint.""

I suppose the greatest dem. victory this week goes to Barack Obama.  As a bleeding heart liberal it really excites me to see minorities elected to the Senate.  Too bad Keyes couldn't pull it out last minute for the Republicans which also would have been interesting.  

I suppose too many good things have happened in the past year and a half...Strom and Ronnie both finally croaked, the Boston Red Sox ""reversed the curse"", I mean, the streak had to end somewhere, right?  (Again, the smartass within me couldn't resist...)

In short, thank you for engaging me in politics.  Thank you for hating and at the same time having an odd sort of respect for my liberalism.  Enjoy the next four years, Mr. H.

Sincerely,

Sarah,
 
It was very good to hear from you. I really don't have anybody to pick on this year. This year's crop of liberals are too serious and don't understand my political humor. 
 
This is the problem with you liberals. The rest of the country knew and accepted his 2000 election of your kind can't let go. Of course, the election was made sweeter by the defeat of that obstructionist from South Dakota.
 
Don't understand why you would feel fearful over the next four years. Did you not hear from Pat robertson that this victory was ordained by God. God would not let anything bad happen to his chosen people, Americans, sorry it is no longer the Jews. They are too liberal for God.
 
Of course Bush should thank the liberal mayor of San francisco and the liberal Mass. Supreme Court for driving the evangelicals to the polls. About an extra 2 million of them turned out largely in those states that had the ban on gay marriages on the ballot and of course one of the states was Ohio. He aslo picked up more women, Hispanics, blacks, Catholics, Jews since 2000. The number one issue that drove people to the polls was over morality. If Kerry had known this he could have easily had 4 or 5 opinions on the topic. I don't think that 1 out of 10 young voters is much to crow about. That's OK. With four more years of Bush, that can easily mean four more wars, too. The future of the young people is secure in fighting to protect the tax cuts of us rich straight Republicans.
 
You need to get on the winning side. Increases in the House and Senate should send a message to the Dem. that America is a centrist-right country and not a divided country as the Dem would have us believe. Your message just does not play well in middle America and the South. Just as Bush needs to reach out to the 2 left coasts, Dem. need to understand the average American. You can't win elections when you spend all your time having to run away from your liberal label.
 
Don't give up the fight, stay involved and one day your side will win again. After all, the angry white men are going to die off one day.
 
Glad you were engaged in the process and take care.
 
Doug Henderson

So there you have it.  Henderson is back with a vengeance."

"event","<i>""A while back, I met a young man named Shamus at the VFW Hall in East Moline, Illinois. He told me he'd joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, his absolute faith in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all any of us might hope for in a child. But then I asked myself: Are we serving Shamus as well as he was serving us? I thought of more than 900 service men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who will not be returning to their hometowns. When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.""</i>

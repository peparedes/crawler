Drink up baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do
You won't but you might
The potential you'll be that you'll never see
The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now
And forget all about the pressure of days
Do what I say and I'll make you okay
And drive them away
The images stuck in your head

The people you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

Drink up baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot

The people you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still"

"event","<small>on december 31st i ran into aaron havner. my heart sunk when i saw him and he had the nerve to talk to me. we were alone outside and he bared his life's story to me. he dealt drugs, did drugs, went to jail for a DUI, got arrested four times lost his family, lost his friends. i no longer feel angry about him anymore, now i just pity his life. he said he joined the marines. and then he apologized to me for how he treated me when we were together. he felt horrible and i could tell that he was sincere. so if i ever run into him again, i'll no longer feel the pain. after four odd years, i'm finally over him."

but anyway life has been pretty good. i've been wanting to move out and i hope i will be able to soon cause my parents and sisters have been such jerks lately and i just want to get away from them. i'm really tired of them and they yell at me for no good reason and i don't want their shit anymore. i really don't.

i've been missing a lot of people. i used to be such good friends with so many people and i've lost all complete touch with them. and i hate it so much. but yeah . . . i'm at work right now. well ""on lunch"" so i gotta head back. k. bye."

"event","so halloween haunt has been taking up all of my time. at least theres only two nights left. not much has really happened. i got my new tattoo. or should i say tattooS. im so excited. but it left me flat broke. 

i stay up too late at night. and wake up too late. i go to bed like at five and wake up at two. i don't know how i'm going to go back to the regular schedule. baaaahhh.

i need a new phone so bad. my sidekick has been pissing me off lately. i've dropped it too many times and the menu button came off. it sucks.

i love mondays. cause i get to hang out with aidee all day. she's the only one i still really talk to from high school. and she's helping me quit smoking. i didn't want to do it alone so we're doing it together. 

ok, i'm done for now."

"event","<small>i hung out with shane for the first time in almost a year. i don't know why he called me and i have no idea why i agreed to hang out with him. well, him, andrew and oscar came to pick me up around eight and we went over to andrew's apartment. they smoke a couple of bowls but i didn't want to. i had a couple of beers though. it was pretty fun. better than being at home by myself. we talked and watched tv, had a couple of good laughs. 
what a fantastic cinco de mayo. haha.

now i'm just sitting in my room watching across the universe for the millionth time. but i love it. and jim sturgess. <3

i just remembered something shane told me a while back. he said that i'm not the relationship type. that i'll never have a boyrfriend and i will always be the girl guys want for just one night. nothing more, nothing less. but what if i want more? i DO want more."

sunday i went to a BBQ. it was my sister's friend's and her family. it was sooo hot. i hated it. i want winter to come back.
then i met up with christin and david and we ate at the california pizza kitchen and then went to see horton hears a who. [AMAZING! by the way] and then hung out a little bit more causing a ruckus at starbucks.

last night after work matt, monica, bryan and i went to ihop. i thought it was hilarious because we were all in our knott's uniform and we went to a 24 hour ihop right across from disney. but anywway, we had a lot of fun. i think i ate too much.

so i've become obsessed with claire danes lately cause of ""my so-called life"". i love that show. too bad it got cancelled. i want a jordan catalano. well, maybe a mix between him and brian krakow.

i saw aaron havner. my enitire body cringe and i just wanted to die. it was so FUCKING horrible. i don't think he saw me cause i ducked down the second i saw him. i thought i was over all of that shit. but i guess no one can really recover from what he did to me. i can't get him out of my head now. and i hate it. cause i spent months just thinking about him. and i thought i was over it all. but just seeing him triggered all of the memories back.

"event","<small>i'm in yucca valley right now. mel, fish and i got here a couple of days ago. before we got here we went to idyllwild. we took a tram up to the mountains and played in the snow. it was such an amazing experience cause i've never seen snow.
then we got to yucca valley and i met mel's dad. he's so cool.

the next day, mel, fish and i went to the living desert which is a zoo in palm desert. it was soo awesome. i got to see a bunch of cool animals.

there's this place behind mel's dad's house with giant statues of jesus. its soo freaky. and eerie. i didn't like that so much. 

and today was our lazy day where we only went thrift store shopping in stores around the neighborhood.

we're going to be heading back tomorrow morning. it's been really nice doing this. it's like a vacation. no work for four days. its really really nice.

but anyway, i'll make sure to post ALL of the pictures up when i get home.

i miss brandon. and my friends. and this might sound really weird, but i miss some of my co workers. i mean i'm used to seeing them like everyday and it's weird not talking to them and stuff."

"event","<small>i was at riptide and i was walking on the platform and there was a shoe sole on the floor so i picked it up and asked everyone if they lost their ""soul"". it was so funny to me. but no one else laughed. i felt pretty lame, but didn't really care.

so matt went back to wyoming after only being back here for like five days. i worked all of those days. but he wanted to see me so he came over to my house like at midnight on thursday even though he had to leave at six in the morning on friday. it was good seeing him. he'll be back in three months.

i haven't been able to sleep AT ALL lately. it sucks. i like sleeping.

no boy troubles. no boys at all. i hate it. i don't know why, but sometimes i feel like a desperately need a guy. to be there for me, and so i could be there for him. i don't like this. it's dumb.

the new year is almost here. i don't like it. i don't like even numbers. can we just skip to 2009? i'm going to be 20 in 2009. how weird it that? super weird.

i'd say i want to blow you away
be with you every night
am i squeezing you too tight?
i guess i'm wishing my life away

i saw him today for like five minutes. he hugged me twice. it was sweet. i love it when guys hug me around the waist. i feel so comfortable and safe. i love his hugs. cause its not awkward or anything. he embraces me and makes it seem like theres no one else but us. 

winsor is moving to chicago. he's really going to do it. and i'm going to miss him. i'll never forget all the times we've hung out in his car. when it was just the two of us and he'd be himself. i'll always remember our first kiss. and our last one. i hope he'll be happy there.

aidee got me addicted to guitar hero. lol. i love it sooooo much. we played last night for like four hours straight. i love aidee.

"event","<small>so i guess i haven't really updated my livejournal in a while. been too busy with work and such. exciting things don't really happen anymore. i got a tattoo. that's new. i got it at the same place eddie got his. well, he referred them to me. my family doesn't know. i really don't know how to tell them. ""oh by the way i got a tattoo two weeks ago."" i don't know.
don't really have any boy trouble cause there aren't any boys. which i really don't like. lately i've been feeling really lonely. even when i'm with around people i still feel lonely and i hate it. sooooooooo much. sosososososososososososososososo much. but there's really nothing i can do about it. i think thats what kills me the most. 
but anyway, i want to quit knotts. i need to find another job first though. everyone is leaving. jason, bree and michael got fired. brett quit. david and jackie are going to quit. theres only to reasons why i'm here right now. i need the money and i'm going to miss my co workers. i've made a lot of friends here. and i like them because they don't know anything about my past. thats the good thing. they don't know the horrible things i've done. and i've done some pretty horrible shit. 

they're making a movie out of chuck palanhuik's book ""choke"" it's my favorite book of his. i can't wait until it comes out next year. it better be good. i don't want to be dissappointed. but most books that are made into movies aren't that great. they always leave oout the little details that i like or change something completely. fight club was a really good book and movie. i love edward norton though.
there was a guy that rode boomerang earlier and i thought he looked exactly like edward norton. i wanted to take a picture with him and tell people that i met edward norton. i'm such a dork.

"event","<small>I pretty much spent the entire day yesterday with aidee. It was sooooo much fun. I missed her so much. So she came by to pick me up around 1:30 and we went to the good will for a while. There was some pretty cute stuff. And then we went to go hookah at the place by my house. It was really nice and relaxing. And then we had some kfc at my house. Went to her house after that and watched some scrubs. Then we went to go pick up erik from work. We went to his house and he burnt us some cds. We left and went to the bella terra to look at some books at barnes and nobles. Then we went to long beach and I saw a bunch of cds that I wanted at fingerprints. After that, we had dinner at my mom's resteraunt. <3 then we went back to aidee's house and watched james and the giant peach. It was pretty cute. I got home around 11:30 and pretty much just crashed.

Now, I'm just waiting for work to start so I can actually do something. Maybe I'll take a nap."

"event","<small> so winsor was non stop texting me last night. Saying how badly he wanted to see me. I fell asleep so I wasn't able to see him.

And at the same time I was talking to loren ans he showed me a song he wrote. It was a song about me. It was so so so cute. Its called ""story of your life"" www.myspace.com/twotonechat. The singing it awful but the words broke my heart. It made me cry because he likes me that much and I so badly want to feel the same way, but I don't. That song breaks my heart. He said that he wanted me to see what he saw in me. And its soooo sweet.

I don't know what to do. Help?"

"event","<small>So I'm on my lunch right now. Things with adam are really good. We've actually been joking around and stuff. Hahaha. I thought that that would never happen in a million years. Well, I don't know when we are going to talk to amy, but I have a feeling that its going to go well. Or at least I hope so. I still want to be cross trained over at perilous. But I guess we'll see. 

Today is so fucken hot. And its a really slow day. I think that I am about to fall asleep.

And on another note, I've decided to just stay single. I'm not going to pursue anyone anymore. Ill let the guy some to me. If it was meant to be, it will.
Why do I always go for the guy I can't have? I'm dumb. Don't listen to me. Hahaha.

So here I am. At lakeside, listening to interpol, with a cigerette, mountain dew and my sidekick. I am pretty content. And I've decided not to talk to jacob anymore for betraying me. It was harsh. I'm still a little frustrated, but ill live on.

I'm alive and thankful for what I have. We all should be. A lot of people have it worse. And I hope that they will be able to live on too. 

The world works in mysterious ways. And I am not going to let it get me down. I am going to go through my life, whether it be another 50 years or days or hours. I will live and try to live it happily.

I guess we all have to get through life one day at a time. And today, I feel good. I feel strong. I feel independent. I feel confident. I feel like myself again.

And it feels amazing. 




Time to go back to work. And I don't mind it at all."

"event","<small> so I have pretty much realized that I can't trust anyone from work. Some of them gossip way too much and I hate it. There was someone that I actually trusted and he betrayed me. Now, I think I'm just going to keep everything to myself or tell my real friends and not the people that I work with. Its insane! Lies spread through out knott's like a wildfire. I don't know what I'm going to do. It's going to take a pretty long time before I trust anyone from work again. And I hate that I'm saying this because I really like some of them. I should've known better. I guess it was a lapse in judgement on my behalf. But now I know. My trust will be the hardest thing to gain. 

So things with adam have gotten somewhat better. We talked on the phone last night at like midnight for about a half an hour. Talking about what we're going to say to amy and how we are going to try to work things out. I really thought that we would end up hanging up on each other, but we really had a nice civilized conversation. So I guess I'm going to try to work with him and see how it goes. I don't know what everyone else is going to say because they hate him. But he brought up a lot of good points. So yeah.

So I'm using my sidekick right now. I'm so excited. I love it. I'm never going to put it down. Haha.


Work in a little bit. Lets see how it goes. Ill probably update during my lunch or something. K. Bye."

yesterday i had a nervous breakdown at work because people were yelling and cursing at me. then i got knee-ed, elbowed, and spat at. i couldn't help but break down and cry right there. it was awful. i wanted to get away. but i couldn't. but my co-workers were really nice.

nathan and his mom gave me a ride home after work. his mom is soooo nice. i really like her. i hope i get to see her again sometime soon. nathan acts the same he does in front of friends and his mom. it was weird. we went to rallys and they told me stories of when nathan was younger. i'm really falling for him.

today, i got yelled at again. i had to hold seats for a handicapped person and the lady i asked to wait another turn yelled at me. and then later on, an old ""handicapped"" man started yelling at me because i let another handicapped person on before him. i only did that because his appointment was before his. the other handicapped person only had one leg. they started arguing and then i started crying again. then hyperventilating. but i had to keep on working. it was so hard. the old man and his group left. the guy with one leg gave me a hug and apologized for arguing and stuff. a random lady hugged me and said i was doing a great job. another lady said that its ok and if i wanted, they were going to get drinks later and wanted me to join them. and that was it. i went on my break and josh talked to me and helped me out. i went back to work and that was it.

i'm starting to think that i'm not cut out for this job."

yesterday i woke up at six o'clock in the morning and drove to san luis obispo with my mom, sister, brandon, and mike. we had to go pick up my sister's car from the impound lot. but yeah, it took about four hours to get there, spent an hour there, and then five more hours back do to traffic. got home around six, missed a call from matt so i called him.

he came over to pick me up [w/ jorge and daniel] and we went to newport beach to see a show. atrementous [or whatever] was good. axiomatic workshop was pretty good too. i don't really remember the third band because they sucked and we spent the entire time out in the patio area. the last person to play was this girl named ruby. i loved her. she had an amazing voice and i loved the lyrics.

overall, pretty good day. i got to have some talk time with mike and i've been too busy working to spend time with him. matt and i finally hung out. maybe again sometime soon. and now i gotta get ready for work today."

after that, we went over to jami's house and played cranium. mike and erica was a team and jami and i were a team. it was fun. then we had a weird discussion about music and mike and erica kept on arguing. we left around 1am or so and went back to mike's house.he played wow and i read one of my new books. im almost halfway through.

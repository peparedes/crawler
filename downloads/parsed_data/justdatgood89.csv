basicly this is what's up guys..

right now i think everybody's getting slightly irratated...i don't think that it has anything to do with anyone in particular..it's just we have about what...15 days left of school?! and we've ALL been putting up with drama and crap for the entire year..

this summer will be amazing...

i think we all need it...to kind of 'regroup'



you know what sucks? to find out that people you love..people you trust are talking shit about you behind your back..i'm not saying people are talking about ME...it's just the little comments people make about each OTHER..and i hear it..i hear EVERYTHING because idk..im one of those random people...i don't hate knowing everything tho..because i'm always 'in the loop'... i just don't like it when ppl start saying that i'm telling ppl shit..because it's more than likely not ME who's saying it..

considering so many people tell more than one person...but w/e



oh heartbreaks...i've had my fair share..but it kills me to see my friends compare their lives to small and insignificant things...becuase I care...reguardless of what people say or think...and while we may be tiny when compared to larger problems, a broken heart still hurts...reguardless if there is something bigger than you out there...




gahhh

"event","One night a guy & a girl were driving home from the movies. 
The boy sensed there was something wrong because of the painful silence they shared between them that night. The girl then asked the boy to pull over because she wanted to talk. She told him that her feelings had changed & that it was time to move on. A silent tear slid down his cheek as he slowly reached into his pocket & passed her a folded note. At that moment, a drunk driver was speeding down that very same street. He swerved right into the drivers seat, killing the boy. Mieraculously, the girl survived. Remembering the note, she pulled it out & read it. ""Without your love, I would die.""

...So lately I've been doing a lot of thinking...and I THINK I MIGHT like somebody...[lol] how fag does that sound?? I'm not even sure if I like him or not..but the funniest part of the whole thing is that I haven't seen him for a pretty long time...like I've seen him...but I haven't had an actual conversation with him in so long...we had a fun summer together last year...it was pretty funny all of the interesting things I found out from him...but I know that it would never work between us...maybe that's why I'm not sure if I like him or not...he's one of those people who think that they can get whoever they want whenever they want..and I'm not all into that...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

...Anyways Justin [my blue haired friend who I'd do in a heartbeat! LMAO j/k] told me that I said like to much and I needed to replace like with 'blow job.' Not happening lol..I love that kid...dude..what if we went out..how bizzaro would that be?!? Amanda=prep...Justin=anti-prep...interesting...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

...In case anyone didn't know already I've decided to have a smaller birthday party with just a few friends because that way we get to do so much more shit..and I've had ppl that I don't even know inviting themselves to my party..so I'm done with the drama..IDK who I'm going to invite yet...Rachel for sure...Carrie definately...but IDK who else..there's too much drama going on right now..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
...I'm sick of all of the fake friends that I have..u know the ones..the friend who talkes about you behind your back or continueously giggles when u get up from the lunch table like they know a secret and won't tell you about it...that's why I'm not sure who I'm going to invite to this party..it's flippin hysterical...they sit there and talk about shit they want to do but don't include me..watever...im done..

This is my tribute to the nice girls. 

To the nice girls who are overlooked, who become friends and nothing more, who spend hours fixating upon their looks and their personalities and their actions because it must be they that are doing something wrong. 

This is for the girls who don't give it up on the first date, who don't want to play mind games, who provide a comforting hug and a supportive audience for a story they've heard a thousand times. 

This is for the girls who understand that they aren't perfect and that the guys they're interested in aren't either.

This is a homage to the girls who laugh loud and often, who are comfortable in skirts and sweats and combat boots, who care more than they should for guys who don't deserve their attention. 

This is for the girls who have spent their weekends sitting on the sidelines of a beer pong tournament or a case race, or playing Florence Nightingale for a vomiting guy friend or a comatose crush, 
who have received a drunk phone call just before dawn from someone who doesn't care enough to invite them over but is still willing to pass out in their bed. 

This is for the girls who have left sad song lyrics in their away messages, 

who have tried to make someone understand through a subliminally appealing profile, 

who have time and time again dropped their male friend hint after hint after hint only to watch him chase after the first blonde girl in a skirt. 

This is for the girls who have been told that they're too good or too smart or too pretty, who have been given compliments as a way of breaking off a relationship 

This one's for the girls who you can take home to mom, but won't because it's easier to sleep with a whore than foster a relationship;
 
this is for the girls who have been led on by words and kisses and touches, all of which were either only true for the moment, or never real to begin with.
 
this is for the girls who believe the excuses because it's easier to believe that it's not that they don't want you, it's that they don't want anyone. 

This is for the girls who have had their hearts broken and their hopes dashed by someone too cavalier to have cared in the first place; 

this is for the nights when you've returned home alone, 

for the nights when you've seen from across the room him leaning a little too close, or standing a little too near, or talking a little too softly for the girl he's with to be a random hookup. 

I honor you for the night his dog died or his grandmother died or his little brother crashed his car and you held him, thinking that if you only comforted him just right, or said the right words, or rubbed his back in the right way then perhaps he'd realize what it was that he already had. This is for the night you realized that it would never happen, and the sunrise you saw the next morning after failing to sleep. 

this is for never realizing that when you choose friends, you always choose those which make you cry yourself to sleep. 
 
this is for the despair you felt as you sat in the aftermath of your tears

This is for the girls who have been used and abused, 
who have endured what he was giving because at least he was giving something;

 this is for the stupidity of the nights we've believed that something was better than nothing, though his something was nothing we'd have ever wanted. 

This is for the girls who have been satisified with too little and who have learned never to expect anything more: 

for the girls who don't think that they deserve more, because they've been conditioned for so long to accept the scraps thrown to them. 

Men sit and question and whine that girls are only attracted to the mean guys, the guys who berate them and belittle them and don't appreciate them and don't want them; who use them for sex and think of little else than where their next conquest will be made. 

Yet, men, I ask you: 

were you to meet one of these genuinely interested, thrillingly compelling, interesting and intelligent and sweet and beautiful and smart girls, were you to give her your number and wait for her to call... 

and if you were to receive a call from her the next day and she, in her truthful, loyal, intelligent and straightforward nice girl fashion, were to tell you that she finds you intriguing and attractive and interesting and worth her time and perhaps material from which she could fashion a boyfriend, would you or would you not immediately call your friends to tell them of the ""stalker chick"" you'd met the night prior, who called you and wore her heart on her sleeve and told the truth? 

And would you, or would you not, refuse to make plans with her, speak with her, see her again, and once again return to the bar or club or party scene and search once more for this ""nice girl"" who you just cannot seem to find? 

Because therein lies the truth, guys: we nice girls are everywhere. But you're not looking for a nice girl. You're not looking for someone genuinely interested in your intermural basketball game, or your anatomy midterm grade, or that argument you keep having with your father;

you're looking for a quick fix, a night when you can pretend to have a connection with another human being which is just as disposable as the condom you were using during it. 

So don't say you're on the lookout for nice girls, guys, when you pass us up on every step you take. 

 See through the disguise. See me. You never do. Why? Because you only see the exterior, you only see the slutty girl who welcomes those advances. 

You don't want the nice girl.. so don't say you're looking for a relationship: relationships take time and energy and intent, three things we're willing to extend - - but in return, we're looking for compassion and loyalty and trust, three things you never seem willing to express.

I can't...you can never forget or deny feelings and emotions...no matter how much i try I will never forget...Forgive? I am a srong believer in God...and the Bible says to forgive...so i went through my list of grudges and forgave people that didn't deserve to be forgiven...tears and blood followed with each and every last memory...painful reminders of a past that I had tried to forget every night as I shut my eyes...then i got to my mistake...my big mistake..and i still can't forgive him...Its funny tho...i try so hard to get people to understand..they whisper words of impropted sorrow..but their is no heart or truth to the lies they speak...they say things i want to hear..not becuase they understand what im going through..but because they feel they should say something...anything to try and console me...Regret? never...you've done it..live with it...but even as i sit here writing the words floating in my mind...even as i sit here staring at this computer..even as you sit here reading this..ask yourself..do you truely understand...do you care at all?...the sad thing is...most of you dont care...most of you are too cought up in your own little drama...your girlfriend dumped you so you come running to Amanda...why is it that i seem to be told every last secret? I know all of the drama surrounding Utica high school...but do you know why people tell me things that i dont necessarily want to hear?? because i care..and i truely do listen...and i dont go around spreading lies about you or myself...but who do i turn to when my world stops spinning??  i turn to my trusted live journal..becuase it seems i cant turn to you..because you truely don't care...

""what do you do if someone you want to be with isnt with you 
and they're the only one that you want to be with?
do you wait, forget, find someone new?
when i cry youre the only one i want to whisper in my ear
youre the only one i want to wipe away my tears
youre the only on i want to kiss my cheek, to tell me im beautiful, to hug me, to promise me you'll never leave me, to keep my forever, to whisper sweet nothings in my ear, to love me, to be my everything.
you're the only one i want and the only one not here"""

this is the story about a girl so damaged she can't even bleed..
he killed her feelings so she died with them....
and shes so sorry for hurting you...  

TO CHRIS:

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because you know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you"

I'm sick of the state we're in
And every little thread is wearing thin
I've been livin' life in the slow lane
But somethings got to change

What time is it where you are?
You're in bed,and I'm at a bar
Right now opposites subtract
And I don't know if I can bridge the gap

The phone bills, 
and missed calls, 
have got us 
they've got us
At the mercy of a mile
In no place to make demands
I'll make it worth your while
But right now it's out of my hands
It's out of my hands

Ode to sleep pillows and sheets
The last place I'd expect us to meet
I'll be back before you know
So don't worry if you're running low

The phone bills, 
and missed calls, 
have got us, 
they've got us hanging
At the mercy of a mile
In no place to make demands
I'll make it worth your while
But right now it's out of my hands
It's out of my hands

At the mercy of a mile
In no place to make demands
I'll make it worth your while
But right now it's out of my hands

At the mercy of a mile
In no place to make demands
I'll make it worth your while
But right now it's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands

MWAS AMANDA ...

This song fits me sooo well!!

I'll stay away 
Don't have to face this 
It's my mistake 
And no one's business 

I am trying not to want to hurt him 
Trying not to start this up again 

He's in my way 
And no surprises 
It's been a day 
Somehow survived it 

Still I am trying not to want to hurt him 
Trying not to start this up again 

(Chorus) 
It's the last thing that I need right now 
Someone to bring me down 
And I've got a rule that I've made up now he moved out 
No way, no boys allowed 
And there's a reason why I keep my distance 
Don't think you're gonna understand 
This is the last thing that I need right now 

No need to stay 
My choice, I made it 
I keep away 
Don't have to take it 

'Cause I'm trying not to want to hurt him 
Trying not to start this up again 

(Chorus) 

Don't need a boyfriend 
Not one like him 
Don't wanna be the foolish girl I was 
And end up worse again 
You can say it's from me 
I'll be keeping away 
Don't wanna be the same foolish girl again 

I'll stay away 
Don't have to face this 
It's my mistake 
And no one's business 

I am trying not to want to hurt him 
Trying not to start this up again 

(Chorus)"

"event","ok..here goes nothing...i have a lot of people feeling sry for me right now...and to be quite honest...im seriously sick of it...im sick of people thinking that im a weak person and i cant handle myself...being with asshole boyfriends like chris made me realize that i can't fall in love with someone because they will end up breaking my heart..so when andy dumped me...i wasn't mad..i wasn't upset...i didn't cry..honestly i was relieved because when i was with him..i felt like some part of me was missing...i was talking to kt about it and i realized that i just cant do the boyfriend thing ne more because ive been hurt so many times that it becomes akward...so am i mad at andy for dumping me? not at all! im relieved because i wasn't even sure that i had feelings for him and i can't be mad at him for telling me the way he feels...im not a mean person like that..do you kno how many people have walked up to me and said, ""if you want me to hate him..i will."" please dont feel sry for me...it only makes matters worse...u kno the one thing that i hate most tho..its when someone walks up to me and there like are you ok and ill be like yea ... im fine...then they'll tell me that im not fine..and that im just on the 'rebound'.. screw you idiots....IM FINE...ive learned not to get emotionally attached ne more...and im sry for making everyones lives so messed up now...because it seems like everytime i have a boyfriend..something goes wrong...im not mad, and i honestly could give a damn....but being friends..right away...that may take more time because of wat laura said to me..she was like isnt it weird that he went out with you for such a short time just to test his feelings for aimee?? that made me think a little bit on how well i know people...that..that sucks if thats the truth...andy likes aimee and im fine with that..i told aimee that i dont really care if she goes out w/ him..but she thinks what he did to her..to us...was wrong... we've been friends forever and i love this girl..but really, if you have feelings for someone, tell them...i got to the point where i didn't tell ne one i liked them..and now i dont have feelings...ANY kind of feelings...im not so sad ne more..i just AM..im not sad..im not happy...im not hungry..im not full...im not tired..im not awake..i just AM.....so honestly..if you like someone...tell them........so you dont end up alone and confused like i did............"

Jump!

I dont wanna wake up today
Cause everyday's the same
And I'd been waiting so long
For things to change
I'm sick of this town
Sick of my job
Sick of my friends 'cause everyone's jaded
Sick of this place, I wanna break free
I'm so frustrated, I just wanna

Jump! (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about tomorrow (Jump!)
I just don't care tonight
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about my sorrow
Let's go
Forget your problems
I just wanna jump

I don't wanna wake up one day
And find out it's too late
To do all the things I wanna do
So I'm gonna pack up my bags
I'm never coming back
'Cause the years are passing by
And I'm wasting all my time
Sick of this house
Sick of being broke
Sick of this town, that's bringing me down
I'm sick of this place, I wanna break free, 
I'm so frustrated, I just wanna jump

Jump! (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about tomorrow (Jump!)
I just don't care tonight, 
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about my sorrow
Let's go
Forget your problems
I just wanna jump
I just wanna jump

I can't take it anymore [x3]

Forget tomorrow, I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about tomorrow (Jump!)
I just don't care tonight, 
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about my sorrow
Let's go
Forget your problems
It's time to let them go
Forget tomorrow, I just wanna jump (Jump!)

I just wanna jump"

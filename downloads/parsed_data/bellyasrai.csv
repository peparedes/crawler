"event","The Earth is moving into an awakening period and soon it will shift back into sleep mode.  Which means that terrible natural disasters will occur to wipe us out of existence.  It's happened many times before and this won't be the last.  But, it doesn't necessarily have to be horrible as long as we as a people have moved into the next level of consciousness.  There are 5 levels of consciousness on this demension of Earth.  Some are on higher levels than others.  I'm sure we've felt it when confronted with those on a lower level than ourselves.  The whales and dolphins are at the highest level.  They've been here since the beginning.  Dolphins make use of their entire brains.  When they sleep they have half shut off and the other still fully conscious.  We humans only use half at while we're awake.  To the dolphins we humans are unconscious.  So if we want to survive this, we all need to WAKE UP!"

"event","This entry is dedicated to Shawn, who reminded me of this journal. If by some chance AmberJean reads this this is a hey to you too. It's been forever since I've updated so lets update....... No more boyz for a while (yes, I left Keene) I work in a cubicle now. Still go to school for communications. Newly discovered passion for politics and actively involved. Got a kittie with no name.Maybe Periwinkle. Bella's 3 and a half now. Cut my hair shorter. Since my new job I can't not wear heals. New found love for John Stewart of the Daily Show. New favorite band Rasputina. Planning on moving to Madison next year. My new favorite author is Michael Moore. I'm addicted to scratch off tickets and cappuccinos. Last but not least is my new found hate for rednecks who drive trucks and suvs who support that son of a bush."

"event","I really need to bring myself back to Earth.
My Earth body is dying without me.  It's being bombarded with fake weaselpeople sent there to suck our homebodies dry.  I feel like my sisters are lightyears away.  My only sanctuary away from the soulsuckers is Bust magz and Absolutely Fabulous videos.  Where are all the real Womyn in Wisconsin?  On my former quest I was in search of an actual MAN, now I'm in search of Womyn who walk with some sense of pride.  Womyn who are fucking real."

"event","hi all. well there's now a monitor on my computer that records everything i do, so im done with this journal. so yeah. its been great, but...yeah...im done lol. so if i talk to u on AIM or whatever watch wat u say cuz chances are my parents will read it. i think i already posted about my parents installing it...but i dont remember. the only time i can update this thing is when im at someone else's house on they're computer. which is never. so i forget what i wrote. but anyway...i might get another journal later on down the road but idk. its kind of a waste of time telling everyone about my day. im sure it isn't very interesting either. i did make a separate journal just for all the million quizzes i take (lol)...but i forgot the sign in name thingy. so that was kind of pointless. so yeah, i dont know what to say...so i'll say bye. bye! <3"

so instead of going to the movies or the bowling alley last night, i was online all night. *sarcasm* great way to spend a friday night! but whatever.

today is my cousins 18th birthday party. i REALLY dont wanna go. but it's at the community pool so hopefully someone from my school will be there or something. idk.

well, it's 11:05 and we still have to wrap the present, get the pool set up, and god knows what else, so ima go do all that. buh-bye!"

it's not my fault all my friends r older than me. it's your fault for having me so late in life. and, come on, a 7 year olds curfew is 8:30, not a 13 year old! im sorry you didn't have a life when you were 13, but i try to. and the night after i get un-grounded, i want to go hang out with my friends. and be out after 8:30! you shouldn't care if im in a car with a teen driver or not! just be happy i have friends! because i'm probably not going to for very much longer. im not going to have a  life for very much longer.

you have no idea how pissed off i am right now. i dont even want to talk about wat happened. bottom line, one of my friends cant be my friend any more because my dad decided to be a jack-ass, i have a curfew of fucking 8:30, and i really dont want to be here right now. i dont want to be living right now. i want everything and everyone to just go away. especially my parents."

"event","ok, here's the story.

last time i wrote, i was at my cousins. we didn't go anywhere, but her boyfriend came to her house. and all we were doing is laying on the couch watching ""dirty dancing"" and ""finding nemo"". so, her parents were supposed to come home at 10 the next morning, BUT...appariently they had planned to leave alcohol on the counter, and had also planned to come home at 4am. so they come home to a guy sleeping on the couch with us and they're other daughter nowhere to be found. when her cerfew if midnight. so yadda yadda yadda...yeah. nothing really happened after that. the other daughter finally came home at about 5 and she got talked to, and yeah.

other than that, nothings really happened. eing grounded is boring as hell. but its been 3 weeks of kissing ass, so idk. shouldn't be too much longer. thats all for now, someones coming. bye."

"event","i'm stupid.
ready, i'll tell you why.

1. i haven't had a job. and the money in my account has been depleting greatly. so now i like, have to start from scratch and it's only been like 2 month since i stopped working at the tanning salon. $300 in 2 months?! wtf!

2. banking so much on my mom giving me free gas. how spoiled am i. well now she told me that i need to buy my own car, own insurance, and own gas. :( --i wanna be little again. my sisters older than me and doesn't have her own car. or own apartment, or life for that matter. she said she would sell my the car i drive now for $2,500. i guess thats a good deal, it's worth like $5,000.

3. i've been slacking in school sooo much. well, just mostly AP euro. holyshit kill me. why did i take this course, i am not smart. i don't do the work anymore. and i'm going to break myself for it laterrrrrrrrrrrr bahhhhhhhh. french has gotten better but OMFG the senior project. i'm like so behind it's not even funny! for my product i have to write 8 opinion based articles and i haven't even started one yet. wtf. the gym final that was due before break, you know that 4 page god damn essay, i haven't done yet either.
help me stop procrastinating. pleasee?
i think i need to up my dose of concerta to about 1000 so it will kill me.
i'm already on fucking 76 mg what the hell!!

i'm so mad at myself.
the concludes my rant.

anyways, i got a job at seabreeze this summer. i'm gunna be operating the rides and stuff. i have orientation on may 3rd. and i need a work permit. don't forget. and then tomarrow i have an interview at brusters! i'd be syked to work there. i haven't had a job where i get to work with other people and jamie works there now too.

my mom's going away the weekend of the 19th and i wasssssssss gunna have some people over after danny's ball on the 20th, but i don't think we're going to his anymore. ugh. i still wanna do something.

i'm sorta not syked on ball. im kinda syked on steph's house. i'm not syked on joel. but i am syked about my dress! which i got. and i'm sure you've seen it and i don't care lblahblahb i like it.

what's gunna happen after ball? aka thing? or what?
what happened to aka by the way,
why don't we ever do anything anymore
---------i mean like everyone, not just a few people who are together all the time that don't invite anyone to anything.
it seems like that was sooo long ago.

basically, i'm stressed out
and nervous.
good thing i don't suffer from serverly sweaty hands syndrome.

so lets chat. college... uhh mcc is looking mroe and more like my only option. which is very very depressing. i think its made me a little bitter lately. so i'm sorry if i've been mean these weeks, idk. i'm spent on worrying about this. i want to have fun the rest of the year.
french isn't letting that happen. i'm so behind in that class. it's rediculous. that class actually makes me feeling like i'm loosing all the infromation i learned in french 1. who knew that in french 4 i'd be dummer than french 1. all my other classes are okay. i guess.
i'm sick of school.
i don't even get a good summer this year. cause i need a job and i'll be taking classes at mcc so i can get out of there as fast as i can with 18 credits.

i decided not to take the ap euro exam.
not even worth it. bahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

i want to go have fun.
my mom is being really gay lately.
things are gay lately.

danny's ball is on may 20th and if he's bringing me, which i'm not even sure if he is or not, i need to start looking for a dress. theres a pretty black one i like from jessica mcclintock. idk on the store website it's not there anymore so i hope they have it

will someone go to the mall with me soon to go look at dresses?

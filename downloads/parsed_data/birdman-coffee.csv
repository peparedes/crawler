"event","Hello Tomato Scouts!
It has been a long time since Camp Tomato, and this is
the first tiem i am calling upon you.

Columbus Day is just around the corner.  Monday, in
fact.

I am hoping we can assemble a bunch of folks to hang
out in front of the post office with tea and cookies
(maybe even tomatoes?)  Whenever anyone approaces the
post office with a letter or package, right when they
see it is closed, yell ""Happy Columbus Day!"" and give
them some tea and cookies!

I hope you all don't mind me not using BCC.  I just
thoguht it could be nice if we all could meet each
otehr.  In the future, I know there are better ways to
do this. 

But for the moment, if you want to do this, please
""reply-all"" and let folks know what post office you
will be at and what time.  That way folks can join in
if they like.  And please invite your non-tomato scout
friends.

Ok!
Away!
I will be out on monday morning.  Probably at the U
District post office.  Hopefulyl by 7 am or so.

Whee!
-Jason

If any of you want to help with the Nov 5th show,
please let me know.

whee again!

This was sent to me by Jason Webley, if you didn't already get that"

"event","hey everyone! well... arts walk was a pretty good time. i'm so sorry to everyone who saw me on saturday that i was being so goddamn depressing. i try not to do that a lot..... TRY. it's just that i hadn't seen amiel in quite awhile and of course being the chicken shit that i am i didn't even go and talk to him. so when i saw him pack up his performance things and leave i got really depressed thinking ""oh so now i won't see him for another year 'cause he probably isn't going to country fair"". for everyone who doesn't know, amiel is the son of one of the mud bay jugglers and he was performing by the washington center with his two friends and they had unicycles and juggled. he was the one in the orange. yeah. god it's depressing to have a crush on someone for seven years and not be able to even go and talk to them. god i suck a lot. 
CAMP TOMATO IS THIS SATURDAY!! holy crap i cannot wait. i'm so excited i'm peeing! i hope the weather stays nice for it. WOO-HOO! 
i talked to my friend sarah anderson today and we came up with the best idea. we're going to go to bellingham on the 20th of may to vist because we both want to go to western. and it'll just be the two of us and we'll stay at our friend megan's house! unfortunatley i kinda have an ulterior motive. well, we all know who lives in bellingham and goes to western don't we? AMIEL! and being the awful person i am, we're going on a weekday so we can see what it's like when people are actually in class. i'm just a horrible stalker ain't i!? ;) heheheh"

EEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!! FREAK OUT! we didn't know what to say. you could hear the crickets chirping. and that wasn't all. on this camping trip he also slapped my mom's ass! THAT'S HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW! HIS SON'S WIFE! he says creepy things to me all the time. ""hey if i were a 16 year old boy i'd definitely be chasing after you"". i don't need to hear that ever! EVER! it's just a little bit traumatizing"

"event","i finally figured out most things for the trip up to seattle to jason webley. i'm soooooo excited that i'm peeing right now (i swear!). only a few more days. WOO!!! it's going to be the best weekend ever! i hate riding the bus though... not that i hate the bus, but that to get to seattle by noon, we have to leave at 9 in the morning. IN THE MORNING! sooooo early. ( and by 'we' i mean, caiti, bri, cameron, and myself.) now i just need to figure out how we're getting back to eula's house (she's my mom's best friend that i've know my whole life.) but staying there will be great. WE'RE STAYING WITH TWO LESBIANS IN WEST SEATTLE WITH TWO DOGS! best weekend ever. 
i have been really freaking tired because i have so much to do in school. at Crapital, i changed from regular English to advanced English, so i'm doing IB English AND spscc classes at the same time! SOOOO TIRED!! my writing class is pissing me off. i thought it was supposed to be about the beauty and eloquence of the writing, not neccisarily what the subject matter is. i'm much better at creative writing. my psychology of human relations class is interesting. we have to interact a lot in that class, so you end up knowing other people pretty well. that's nice. but after we read about some kind of human reaction and response, we have to apply our own problems and situations to it. i get kind of uncomfortable talking about personal problems like friend problems, self esteem issues, or my dad's attempted suicide. but i guess that i must want to talk about it with someone or else i wouldn't mention it. i guess i just feel easier talking to people who don't know me because they'll usually listen and won't think ""oh, that's just what Olivia does, she so dramatic....or whatever"", like some people i know do. they don't take me seriously. hopefully this class with help me with my crippling depression and insecurity. Desi is in that class and she's pretty great. i wanted to go to the show she told me about that was tonight ( i think leah went) but i'm just too damn tired.
i went to my dad's last weekend. that was ok. he's entering that stage where he wants to buy my love, and i'm totally ok with that since he hasn't paid child support in 3 years. i asked him for money for the webley concert. he was reluctant to give to me and i said ""well, considering you haven't paid child support in 3 years, you should give me some goddamn money."" he got really mad, but i think i got my point across. GOD! i hate leaving my dad. every time he drops me off back at home, after he leaves i cry. every time. i and realised last weekend that it's a million times worse when i'm at home by myself. i was hyperventalating, gasping for air, with no one to comfort me. i'm just so afraid that every time he leaves, it's the last time i'll see him. he says he feels better, but i'm still scared he's going to kill himself. jeez, i'm crying right now.

well, i'll just think of the upcoming weekend and the webley/seattle trip next weekend. YAY! HAPPINESS! i feel better.

YEA!!! and then we posed with him. he had one arm around me, one around bri, micheala was next to me, and we were all showing his signature on our boob. jonathan took a picture! woooo! that will be my favorite picture for the rest of my life. but jason was really reluctant to sign us. he said ""Am i going to get in any legal trouble?"" he even signed people's shirts and pants and had entire conversations with other people before we could convince him to sign us. IT WAS THE BEST! JASON WEBLEY SIGNED MY BOOB!!! and the night just got better. then me, caiti, and elyse came back to caiti's house and watched......MARGARET CHO! until three in the morning.

on a lighter note, i started spscc on monday. i'm loving it!!! all of my teachers are really nice. the only bad thing is that i'm always really tired. i have to get up at 5.30 in the morning and i stay at school until 3.40 tuesdays and thursdays. so, blah. my psychology of human relations is really neat. on our first day we shared something that we needed to tell someone and worked to get all the points across. it was kind of awkward talking about real problems with people i don't know. hmmm....
leah, elyse, and caiti have started work on their band. it's so cool! i get to be their publicist/ dresser. yeah!!! i'm working on their poster right now. i'm so happy that i get to at least help with a band if i can't be in one."

"event","well, i just got back from staying at Shelby's in seattle for a couple days. that was very strange/uncomfortable/fun. i met some of her friends. they are pretty cool. we went to a park in renton and met sarah, zac, and heather. then we met adam and he drove us back to seattle to a place kind of like stonewall. adam is the coolest!(and my dear friends you know that he's not cooler than you, well maybe a few, joking). anyways, at the stonewall like place i met this girl called 'blue' but she's transgender so actually i met this guy called 'blue'. he's ok. he says 'yo' 'tight' 'for shizzle' and 'hella' WAY too much! he stayed over at shelby's last night to. we tried to watch 'dead alive' but blue got sick about half an hour into it. then all night shelby was ""complaining"" that adam has feelings for her and she doesn't like him back. she said ""god, why does he like me. i wish he didn't like me. he needs to stop liking me. i can't believe he likes me"" jeez. why does she have to complain about people having feelings for her? it's not a bad thing. almost half of her friends are attracted to her. it's not as if she has no love at all. ""oh-no, two women love me...my wallet's too small for my 50's, and my diamond shoes are too tight!"" stop complaining about inane things! be happy with what you got that other people don't! but, all in all i had a pretty good time. shelby's great. 
it's nice to be back though. well, technically i'm not home yet. i'm at my crazy step-grandparents. mom and nick are at a concert. and what concert are they at.............
                PRINCE!
i'm sooooooooo jealous. it's not fair! nick got free tickets today at about 5pm and I was sitting there with him at his work and he doesn't even take me. what the HELL is that? he says he'll pay me back by taking me to 'hero' on thursday, but we were already planning to go on thursday. how is that paying me back!? they always do things and see things that they KNOW that i want to do to. they SUCK!
note to kara: here's a little boost to your self-essteem; shelby thinks you're extremely hot. that was the topic of much of our conversation throughout the weekend. ;)hehehehehehe"

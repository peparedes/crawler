Tomorrow will be reeeeal exciting.<br /><br /><strike>Why do the&nbsp;SCARY ones always hit on ME?<br /></strike><br />I wonder if I could&nbsp;fake something unfornate&nbsp;convincingly and get my homework off of someone from study group.

It has good principles, works in theory, and the minute it's put into practice it all falls apart because people get distracted by the idea of making a profit over genuine emotion of the masses. Not that I'm one to talk but still.</p>"

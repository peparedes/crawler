It's been a while.

So I tried to archive my journal using <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/ljarchive/"" target=""new"">ljArchive</a>, but it seems that LJ has made some sort of change which no longer allows this program to function properly (and the developer hasn't maintained the software since 2006).

Any recommendations for software that would allow me to backup the contents of my LJ onto my hard drive?"

And she has no idea how she's done it
But he loves her
With a fierceness that she has never seen
With clenched fists and bunched shoulders
Hard lines, her protector
Tooth and claw and savagery

Her soft places have found a safety
Nestled in his ribcage
Rolled out like a luxurious carpet
Climbing the walls
and growing
glowing
Filling the space that once was empty

He prowls the walls outside, watching
Pacing
Challenging
No one gets inside; no one is allowed to hurt her
She is his most precious
The only thing he ever owned that mattered
he wraps her in his softness and rests her there

He is the fastness
The kingdom, the king
He loves her
And she knows"

"event","I had a dream last night that this crazy young woman (maybe an aunt?) was trying to keep us in separate rooms.  She belonged to some weird cult (I think Mormonism) and she dressed like a pioneer, lived in a big farm house, and carried a shotgun.  She holding us captive and violently trying to ensure that we didn't have contact because she was afraid we would have sex, which was the worst sin she could think of.  I think we were brother and sister.  We escaped her clutches and fooled around right in front of her.  Nya nya.

<lj-cut text=""gooey mushy love vomit - enter at your own peril"">
In reality, we went inner tubing on the American River last weekend and it made me realize, with sharper clarity, some more reasons why I love Jesse.  When I'm with him, I feel like we are a team.  I feel secure in the certainty that whatever obstacles we meet, we will be meeting them together and sharing the work.  I know that when I make a mistake, he is going to be understanding and forgiving, and when he makes a mistake, I do my best to be understanding and let him know in the nicest way possible.  I also know that he likes being around me as much as I like being around him.  If I'm upset or frustrated, all he has to do is put his hand on my skin and I feel instantly better.  Being part of a team feels so nice.  Euphorically so.

He took some videos at Camp and Sons the weekend before last, and while he was showing them to me, we came across one of two people carrying a giant brass platter piled with fruit to the loungers on the lawn.  ""This was a great opportunity,"" he said, ""because I got to explain to Hans one of the reasons I love you.  As cool as it was to be me and Hans on the lawn, having people bring us fruit, it's even cooler to be those people doing the bringing.  You taught me that.""

This is going to be the greatest adventure."

"event","Had some weird dreams.  First I dreamed I was a falcon princess and all of the young male falcons were fighting viciously for the right to mate with me.  It's the first time I can remember ever dreaming that I was an animal.

Then I dreamed that Jesse, Dafna, Veronica and I visited DC and as we were walking around at night I stopped in front of a jewelry store window.  Jesse came up from behind and put his arms around me and said, ""I want to be with you forever,"" and I said, ""You will be.""  Then he turned me around to face him and got down on one knee and said, ""No really,"" and held out a an antique ring with a light blue stone that had a crack down the middle.  I started crying and said of course, and then this homeless guy came up on the sidewalk and was trying to get our attention.  ""Not now,"" I said, and tried to shoo him away, but it turned out that he was trying to warn us that we needed to flee because we were about to get mugged by a gang.  The gang arrived and the homeless man fled and they waved guns in our faces and demanded our valuables.  ""Not today,"" I said.  ""Any other day you could've had whatever you wanted but you can't have this.""  We argued for a while before he fired a warning shot, at which point Dafna, Veronica, and Jesse ran.  I struggled with the man, trying to make sure that while he was firing, the gun remained pointed in the air, away from anyone.  I waited for the clip to empty, but it never did - he just had endless bullets.  He got his hands free of mine and began shooting straight ahead, and I saw that Veronica was still in the middle of the road.  I ran to her, and tackled her to the ground behind a cement divider.  I could hear police sirens and see their flashing lights, but the gangsters were still shooting.  ""Why aren't they helping us?"" I asked, and Veronica said, ""They're probably worried about shooting us by accident.""  It seemed to go on for ages, and I started to wonder how we hadn't been shot.  When it eventually stopped, someone came over and ushered me in to the jewelry shop.  Jesse was lying on a table, being operated on.  He'd been shot in the spine, protecting me while I went to save my sister.  There was a chance that he could eventually regain all motion, but there was a greater chance that he would be paralyzed for life from the neck down.  ""I'll understand if you no longer want to get married.  This is going to be hard work.""  I was crying and told him to shut up.  ""Of course I want to be with you."""

"event","I had a dream last night that Quin was living in this huge four bedroom Victorian (or maybe Edwardian or early craftsman).  He had been subletting, but he was the only person left in the house and had decided to move.  When I came to help him on moving day, he suggested I take the lease off his hands.  The place had kind of a strange layout - the top two bedrooms had only a curtain between them and you had to walk through one to get to the other.  Also, it was in Alameda.  But it was cheap and huge and beautiful.  I hesitated, because why would I want to live in Alameda again?  But then I realized that I'd had dreams about living in a place like this, and I petitioned Jesse on those terms.

Tues - Salsa lessons.  Great instructor, a lot of fun.

Wed - Rode to the main campus of CCSF, then to the Legion of Honor where I met Hanae and saw the Cult of Beauty exhibit.  Went home and dicked around before going to Fumi's for craft night.

Thurs - Stayed in.  It was amazing.  I was missing Jesse.

Fri - Drinks with Tippett people at Misery Lounge, California Honeydrops at New Parrish for Holly's bday.  Had to leave when it was just getting good so that we could make BART.

Sat - Chores, sex, went to Potrero Hill for a clothing swap only to find out it's on the 21st.  Hit TJ's on the way home, then made breakfast for dinner: sausage, challah French toast, and asparagus with hollandaise.  Girls night at Dafna's with Mantissa, Lauren, Laura, and Veronica.

Sun - Easter at Grandma's.  Stuffed my face with so much sugar.  Balanced my checkbook.  Grandma said I could have their <a href=""http://www.simnia.com/rain_lamps/"">rain lamp from the 70's</a>.  The catch was that I had to get it down from where it was hanging in Grandpa's room, which was no small feat.  I almost died, but it was worth it.  Unfortunately, I didn't think about the possibility of it still having oil in it after over two decades of non-use, so I leaked all the way home.  Embarrassing, but ultimately worth it.

Mon - super slow at work, everyone cranky.  Off to FJCD."

Every other Monday I host a Fucken Juicy Chicken Dinner.  I make fucken juicy chicken, and everyone pitches in with a bottle of wine, a side, a snack, a dessert - just a little something to share.  Then we all sit around and drink wine and converse and a good time is had by all.  I've been doing this for about five months now.  I wouldn't be able to do it without Jesse's help - it's just too much work for one person to do all the prep and setup.  It also helps that Dafna and Hanae come every time - so even if no one else shows up, there's at least the four of us.  And they've always brought really delicious shit.

Last night, Hanae told me that I'm a really fantastic hostess and that the reason the sides people bring have gotten progressively nicer is that people see how much I bring to it and they are inspired to step up their game.  It made me so very very happy to hear that.  I really try very hard to make people feel comfortable and welcome, partially because of my own social anxiety.  I felt so full of pride and joy to hear that my efforts were not only appreciated, but noticed as well.

Yesterday (after work and before FJCD) we went to Planned Parenthood and I got a hormonal IUD inserted.  It was painful for about fifteen seconds, and somewhat uncomfortable for another minute and a half or so.  But then that's it, for the next five years.  Although Jesse's new insurance plan covers vasectomy, which I'm kind of pushing for.  (Oh yeah, Jesse started back at Tippett Studio last Monday.)  I just figure if we're going to be traveling around the world, it would be a lot easier to not have to search for birth control in a foreign country.  

I told Jesse he didn't need to go with me, but he got off of work earlier anyway so that he could.  He is so very good to me."

Fri - Decentralized Dance Party in Union Square.  Went to the Gold Dust to get a little pre-party going.  By the time we caught up to the floating party, they were playing the last song (busted by the cops).  We showed up just in time to have missed running into Mary.  Went to Dave's and got hot dogs, then on to the Mission where we pumped the jams on Hanae's mom's ghetto blaster.  That thing is as big as she is.  People loved it until we played some hip hop.  Mission Bar for one round, started heading to the Elbo Room, Hanae realized she'd left her wallet.  Some nice hipsters had returned it to the bartender so she bought them a round.  Back to Dafna's where we got through one beer before we had to go home because we were so cute we were disgusting even ourselves.

Sat - Tried to get a free bookshelf of craigslist, but Skip skipped.  Terrible burritos in SoMa, got some hot fabric for curtains, stopped by Walgreen's.  Met Hanae at the Brown Jug, which does not have the $7 beer/shot/PBJ sandwich that Jesse had read about on the internet.  Bartender was nice, will definitely go back.  On to Edinburgh Castle, Hanae's new favorite bar, which she said was like The Pub and filled with old people.  They were playing old Motown hits and it was filled with snotty hipster fucks.  Ate at the Thai place on the corner, which was awesome, had one more pint at Edinburgh, and parted ways.

Sun - sore throat, face full of snot.  Stayed home and did laundry and a tweaker stole some of Jesse's clothes out of the dryer.  After that, I wasn't in the mood to see people so I didn't go to the Friends meeting.  Still folding laundry, bed soon.

I closed my OKCupid account tonight.  It hadn't even occurred to me to do so until Jesse said that he had closed his.  Why?  ""Because I'm not going to need it anymore.""  Oh yeah.  I did feel like I needed a moment of silence, though, as I've had the account for nearly a decade.  But I won't miss it."

My mom lived in a gated community with a pool and I went swimming but it was so filled with people that there was no room for me and I soon left to pester my lover, a black guy who was trying to study.

He was living in a room at his high school that he'd gotten for being the marching band leader and had never moved out.  We got tattooed together and I woke up one morning and surveyed them and was horrified to find a red Camaro in a parking lot tattooed on my inner calf.  I guess the sentimental value is that it was where I had lost my virginity, but it was so ugly.  I vowed to take a break from getting any more tattoos, especially on a whim.  I was just getting to the point where I was considering officially dating Devin, beginning to think that he was really sweet and perhaps boyfriend material after all.  We were laying in bed one morning and he made a call to a girl, on speakerphone, with a thinly veiled request for her to bring condoms over.  Then he asked me to leave.  I wasn't jealous or mad, really, just shocked at his gumption and irritated at myself for having considered dating him.  ""I can't believe you would do such a thing.  I mean, we're not dating, so it's fine if you sleep with other girls, but that's just cruel.""  ""Whatever,"" he said.  ""One girl born in 1984 is the same as any other girl born in 1984.""  I realized then that he had been deliberately crass because he was starting to develop feelings for me and it scared him.  He was preemptively putting distance between us.  I had recognized the woman's voice as that of Aunty Jen and so I told him, ""She wasn't born in 1984.  She just turned 39.""  ""What?  I met her on freshfuck.com.  39 isn't fresh!""  And I just laughed at him for his incompetent attempt to make me jealous and left.

On Saturday night we slept in a tent with only one sleeping bag.  It was cold and hard and I slept fitfully and I had two dreams that I remember.  In the first one, I was trying to make myself eggs and pancakes on a camp stove, and I was going to have strawberry ice cream for desert.  While I was frying my egg, Jason came up and said something that he meant as a joke, but I was a bit offended by it.  So he wanted to talk about it, to process it, and I told him I would talk about it when I was done cooking.  But he insisted that we talk about it right then, so we did and got into a huge fight and he ended up storming off.  By that time, the egg had burned and the stove had been going so long that it had melted the aluminum ice cream scoop sitting next to it.

In the second dream I was engaged to a guy named Frank.  I was planning a surprise birthday party for him with his friends, and we were all dressed like we were in an 80s movie.  Nothing was going as planned, and when I got to the venue so that I could put out balloons, there was a guy sitting there on a computer.  He swiveled around in his chair, and it was Jacob Appelbaum.  ""What the..?""  Frank arrived and introduced him as his brother.  He picked up on my uncomfortable body language and asked, ""Do you two know each other?""  ""We just met,"" Jacob said, grinning ear to ear.  I was rolling my eyes internally thinking, ""Shit, I picked the wrong brother.  This is going to get ugly.""

The following night we stayed in a nice cushy hotel room bed.  I dreamed that I moved into a building that the landlord was trying to promote as a singles den.  It was a lot like my place on Athol, but older and taller.  All of the flats were studios or one bedrooms and the landlord had this vision of it being a community place for single people to meet each other rather than just a place to live.  There was a big rec room on the ground floor, which gave it a very college dorm feel.  When the apartment manager (Rich, although the Rich I thought he was when I first met him - not the crazy retard he turned out to be) gave me the keys, this cute guy with Buddy Holly glasses was just leaving, locking up his apartment.  Rich introduced us, and the guy left.  ""Who was that?"" I inquired.  ""That's Jesse.  Don't get your hopes up - he has a girlfriend.""  So I lived in this place for a year, pining after Jesse.  His girlfriend broke up with him, and I consoled him through it.  We started hanging out a lot, but still he didn't make any moves.  The venture seemed to be successful for other people - people started hooking up and moving out in pairs.  Despite this, the building owner started to despair that his plan wasn't working.  With all of the couples moving out, he was having trouble filling the empty flats.  Then this one guy moved in.  He got really drunk, and fell in the courtyard.  A picture of him midair on the way to being sprawled on the cement, sporting a sleeveless t-shirt and flip flops, ended up on the front page of some newspaper.  The landlord was horrified.  ""Would you want to live in a building with that guy?!"" he moaned.  ""Actually, yeah,"" I reassured him.  ""That dude is a hot, young, loaded entrepreneur.""  Sure enough, the media exposure brought people in and the building was full in no time.  It was summer and I realized I'd been there a whole year.  When I had arrived, the building had been filled with old-timers that pre-dated the landlord, and with lots of RS-type people.  Now it was mostly filled with yuppies my age.  Things were humming.  I didn't know at least half the people living there, which made me both nostalgic and optimistic.  I was showing this new girl around, and we passed an open front door from which we could see the fit, blonde, male inhabitant brushing his teeth in his towel.  ""I'd hit that,"" I teased.  But later that day, Jesse said, ""So...do you want to move into my flat, or should I move in to yours?""  I was shocked and ecstatic.  I began to gather my things straight away.  I was still living out of just the two suitcases, the only extraneous possessions being a collection of board games.  I took those down to leave in the rec room, leaving a suggestion with the landlord that we have a weekly board game night.  Some girl was talking to Rich, expressing doubt about this whole ""singles complex"" concept.  ""It works,"" I assured her.  ""See that guy?"" I said, pointing at Jesse.  ""When I first moved in to this building, I took one look at him and said, 'I want that one.'  Now we're moving in together.""

Last night I dreamed that Hanae and I got married, but it was a mystery to all of us why.  Elvis came back but he was this hot British guy who came to hang out with Dust Fish (which Mary was involved with).  The first night he was there we went to this concert and met up with Hanae and Mariel and we were all dressed in dark clothes.  Pam showed up in a tight red dress and got super wasted and the dress tore down the back and she wasn't wearing any underwear.  I tried to tie it in such a way that her bits were hidden, but for it to work, she would've had to stay still and that wasn't going to happen.  After we left, I had sex with the dude, but I was still horny afterwards and so I had sex with a cardboard box in an alley.  (Don't ask how it worked because it didn't really.)  The next night we were all going to go to some costume ball and we were being bothered by these kids who wouldn't leave my grandma's front yard because they wanted to play on the jungle gym there.  I had to escort them to the park around the block, at the elementary school.  They had built a sick ass water slide there and when I got the kids situated, my uncle came out to have a go on one."

"event","The Polish lodgers tried to poison me.  They offered me spaghetti with meat sauce because they'd made too much.  I had some just before going out to the club.

A few hours later I began to feel a bit queasy.  Someone thought it was because of some drama I'd gotten myself embroiled in.  (Yes, I'm already getting my hands dirty.  I'm slick like that.)

I ran outside, because I couldn't make the bathroom.  I was also in denial that I was actually going to throw up.  Until I did.  The guys down the street must've thought I was some sad drunkard.  Spaghetti all over the pavement.

I was pretty sure it was the spaghetti, but was worried that I might be sick.  I'm supposed to work again tomorrow, and it would be utter shit to call in sick on my second day.  Linda said she thinks it's been on the stove since Friday.  Mystery solved.

Someone offered to give me a ride home.  I waited patiently while he said his goodbyes.  As soon as we exited the building, I yakked again."

Baby, I'm lying in wait
The stakes are set high and I'm taking the bait
I'll skate on your thin ice all day
Feeling all the undercurrents running from yesterday
I'll do all the pulling, but you've got the final say

Baby, my arms are open wide
Waiting for you to step inside
To catch you when you curl up and hide
I will lick the tears when you need to cry
Enfold you in my hiding place
In my escape I'll keep you safe
And scrape the dismal waste of waiting off your face

Baby, one more soft week
Sneaks by me in the street
And every new person I meet
Just ain't you
And baby, don't you know?
That I would go if you asked me to
Walk the line that you drew
And any other line that will ensue

Baby, I'm your blank page
And all of your world is my stage
We were made for each other
With your skin like butter and my words in the cloud cover
Old memories smothered to death
And I'm willing to love you under my breath
If that's what you need from me"

And the light goes dead on the salt flats of her mind
She climbs under the bed and hides her face inside
While his eyes are red and open wide
Keeps her soft and pliant against the hard edge of defiance
The night creeps in until her skin gently weeps
His silence in the torrent keeps her body feeling tender
Quiet in his slowness seeks the moment of surrender
Fingertips walking lingering softly
Sniff out the raindrops gushing from the wings
So that underneath the humming sun the inside of her sings"

And the only decision I've made is to stay inside
I can't seem to climb out of my breath
To leave this pile of bones and flesh to its unrelenting state of unrest
Discontent strewn around the room
Blanketed in the stench of another fool moon
Cooling any thoughts of rupture
Can't get this spitfire out of its slumber
Under heavy eyelids, awakening more numb
The drumbeat softly calling and I can't seem to succumb
Oh lord, what haven't I done?"

I can't get your smell out of my hair
Or your taste off of my fingers
Everywhere your imprint lingers
A mouthful of soap and still you're there
Your eyes, your hair remain inside
My teeth feel your skin beneath
Every cut and corner of your body breathes me to sleep
I keep running into thoughts of you and then this rush
Comes up from underneath white knuckles,
Gushing in the middle until my knees buckle
Feeling the absence of your breath and stubble
I collapse into an utter pile of rubble
Tumbling through thoughts of you under duress
And landing in a half-dressed pile of white-hot mess"

"event","She lifted a heavy cut glass vase from the side table and hurled it at the brick fireplace. She'd put it there several weeks ago for just such an occasion. It popped and shattered as she screamed,

""Start giving a shit! Start caring!""

He leaned forward, elbows on knees.

""I do care,"" he said evenly. ""I just don't care the way you do.""

""Why not?"" She stamped her foot on the rug, arms crossed, tears poised and ready to jump off the rims of her eyelids.

""Because that's not the way I work.""

She stared at his blue eyes through the shimmering waves of her tears. She wanted to splinter the ocean of his eyes, cut the calm and cause tempests through which no ship could safely navigate. She wanted movement, action, a sign from God.

""Fuck you!"" she screeched. The tide was out, the tears tore over her skin. ""Why don't you love me?!"" The totality despair turned into a wave of violent urges that crashed over her. She trembled like disturbed water. Her eyes no longer saw, pulled into the storm.

He stood and wrapped his steady arms around her. His breath trickled through her hair, arriving on her neck damp and hot. ""I do love you."" The tremors melted with the tension, and suddenly she was very tired.

They fell asleep curled around each other."

He's my pretend friend
Like, ""When things are going my way, then we're on the mend, ken?""
And any other trend I might defend
Means I've gone round the bend
So every new beginning is the beginning of an end
Depending on the thinning of the words that might offend
Then
He tells me I'm a wreck: I've no idea what I've done
He thinks that I lack loyalty because he himself has none
Among his thoughts of me I'm stunned to find not a single one
Beyond his concern of whether or not he's won
So I jump the gun off his gameboard
I'm not playing any more
The score is rigged and the rules aren't fair
I'm through with tearing out my hair
In desperate heartfelt shows of care
Searching endlessly when there's nothing there
Sparing no expense in my attempts to share his every burden and prayer
Only to find this intense affair a pretense
An immense undertaking to shake a loneliness a lifetime in the making

He's my friend in fair weather
It will never, ever get better
So now I know that it's time to let go of the urge to defend
My never-really-was-my friend"

He is the Lion
All mane and muscle
Every strain and struggle
Hidden under silky fur and tufts of stubble
Utterly subtle
He's nothing but trouble

Unutterable strength and prowess lines his jaws
I curl up to feel small beneath his paws
Secretly extending my claws
I rub myself raw with the power of his stink
Slinking through grasslands to take a drink
To feast upon his blood and flesh
Bury him in me and breathe his breath
Cut his leveled tones and test the breadth of his level best
Ride the crest of his roar and sweat
Upset the rhythm of his breast
And stress any unswept mess he keeps locked in his chest

Because if I don't unsettle him, nothing will
Perched on the hill, he keeps himself still
Barely blinking as he surveys the kill
Like nothing ever happened and nothing ever will
Under his reign and sovereign skill
Never flinching when blood is spilled

He is the lion, all muscle and mane
Surveying with pleasure the whole of his terrain
He is the lion
And I am his domain"

Amidst all the passing people
Her loneliness is inscribed
And in her solitude
Her words become alive

Rooted amidst chaos
Determined to survive
She seeks to find the patterns
In the strangers passing by

This one feels like loneliness
And this one feels like fear
That one woke up late today
And this guy smells like beer

Everyone in a hurry
So many places for to go
No standing still, no pausing
Don't interrupt the flow

Yet amidst this madness
There's something to be had
The course of human interchange
Leaves her feeling glad"

"event","Tuesday - spent all day at the British Museum and didn't even get to the Rosetta Stone.  I could spend years there and not see everything.  A note on mummies: a museum has got to be the only place where one can stare at dead bodies and not be considered morbid.

Wednesday - Tried to go to the Apsley House (for the joint ticket with the Wellington Arch) but the Arch was closed and I decided I'd come back later.  Time is money and right now I have an abundance of time.  Walked to Speaker's Corner but there was nothing happening.  Visited Westminster (Lady's Chapel is AMAZING).  Note on audio tours vs. guided tours: nice because you can go at your own pace, but you can't get slightly different tours on each visit and you don't have the benefit of having others around you who will ask questions you never thought of.  Went from there to the War Rooms/Churchill Museum.  Didn't realize that once upon a time he was a handsome guy.  Also didn't know that he won the Nobel Prize for literature.  It was on display.  I GOT TO LOOK AT A NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE!  Squee!

Hung around the house and caught up on email and stuff today.  Turned out to be the perfect day for doing so as it was the first day it rained since I've been here.  Tonight we're going to eat at a restaurant in the dark."

"event","Friday - Met up at the White Horse for drinks.  Karaoke at Korean place.  Awesome food, lots o booze, hilarity ensued.

Saturday - walked around a lot trying to get things done like retrieving money, getting a phone, and acquiring an Oyster card.  Still no phone.  Had dinner with <lj user=nitoda>, her partner, and some of their friends in a fabulous Turkish restaurant called Taz near London Bridge.  My favorite was the lamb kidney.  The bathrooms were gorgeous.  Conversation was pleasant and stimulating, and I got lots of advice on places to visit.  Very excited to see some of the city with <lj user=nitoda>.  Afterwards had some drinks at Jaguar Shoes and the Owl and the Pussycat.  Ended up at a tittie bar, which is a slightly different experience than in the states.  Asked for a private dance, was surprised when Jesse didn't follow me.  Would've been a lot more fun if I had been able to watch him squirm.

Sunday - Went to the V&A but wasn't there nearly long enough to appreciate it.  Definitely plan on returning.  The bathrooms were interesting, but still not as pretty as those at Taz.  Went to the Science Museum because Jesse wanted to look at the Foucault Pendulum they have there.  It was a slight letdown as it was kind of tucked in a corner, looking like an afterthought.  I told him I would take him to the (way cooler) one at California Academy of Sciences next time he was home for a visit.  Went to Camden to try to find him a new jacket and failed.  Then we hoofed it to Pub on the Park near London Fields for his friends birthday party where we had a really fabulous pub meal (mushroom wellington - it was amazing), and then we went home and watched a movie cause we were pooped from taking transit all day.  (Seriously - stairmaster?  Fuck that.  Just take the Tube.)

Moday - First day out all on my own.  Spent most of the day at St. Paul's.  A little disappointed that the Golden Gallery was closed, but was so blown away by the whole thing that I could've spent at least another hour there when they kicked me out because they were closing.  Crossed the Millennium Bridge to go to the Tate, which I need to go back to and spend more time in.  Also, I need to refine my ability to appreciate art.  Came back here to blog real quick, now dinner."

"event","After sorting my stuff yesterday I mostly just dicked around on the computer, not really wanting to leave the house.  Also, I was very hungry, and I wanted to get used to that, as with my new no-income budget I feel I should probably acclimate myself to one or two meals per day.

Last night we went out on an art walk with Jesse's friends and the Korean synth-pop duo EE [Total Art].  The highlights of the walk were free booze and this one installation where the artist had taken dead animals and sewn them together frankenstein style.  She had made a pair of high heels out of hooves and cow hair.  I wanted to take a picture for Jen, but figured it's probably not kosher to take photos in an art gallery.  We ended the evening with tasty Indian food.  Also, EE told me that the word I was thinking of was norebong, but that norebong is actually slightly different from karaoke in that no alcohol is served.  And apparently if you're looking for a date, that's one of the services provided at norebong.

I didn't sleep well last night as I kept alternating between too hot under the blanket and too cold without it and slept til 14:30 today (lame).  After I get dressed and stuff I'll be taking my excess suitcase to Oxfam.  It's about a mile away.  Jesse recommended I bus it, but I think I can walk that far.  I'm getting into the Boris-type mentality of watching my expenditures.  ""The bus costs how much?  Fuck it, I can walk."""

"event","I was this close to not being allowed entry.  ""No return ticket?  No itinerary?  No budget?""  They detained me for four hours.  Luckily, I'm well-dressed, eloquent, and charming.  I also have several grand in the bank and someone to stay with for the first three weeks.  And the guy who interviewed me was younger and single.  Hard to say what the tipping point was.

When they released me I tried to take the tube to Jesse's flat.  Tried.  I looked at the map and saw that I should take the Picadilly Line and transfer to the Northern Line at King's Cross.  But then when I was on the train, I saw that the Northern Line meets with Picadilly at Licester Square as well, and fearing that it would be too crowded at King's Cross for me to wrestle my massive amount of luggage through, I decided to transfer there.  This was a mistake.  The part of the Northern Line that goes through Licester Square will not get you to Old Street station.  Oops.  Also, there are a lot of stairs and no lift.  I was surprised at how many people offered to help.  Of course my proud, independent ass was all, ""No thanks, I can do it.""  And they would just grab a suitcase anyway.  Totally awesome.

Rather than continue to get lost on the tube and burden more passing strangers, I decided to get off and take a cab to Jesse's, where I sat on my luggage and read a book for three hours rather than try to cart my crap down the road and try to find a warm pub in which to pass the time.

Jesse and I went out and had some drinks with his friends.  They were rad and funny.  Can't say much more than that as my memory became fuzzy really early on.  Although I can say - men ordering bottles of wine in a bar?  Awesome!

My issues with traveling around yesterday convinced me that two large suitcases and one carry-on is still too much, so I spent today paring all my worldly possessions down further, and I'm proud to say I've got it to one large suitcase, one carry-on, a laptop bag and a purse.

Maybe it's because I'm at Jesse's, or maybe it's all the foreigners walking around, but I don't really feel like I'm in another country quite yet.  I wonder how long it will take for me to feel strange.

Tonight we karaoke.  Although they said it was at a Korean place, and don't they call it something different in Korea?"

"event","He was utterly gorgeous.  He was sitting behind me in a writing class - not too tall, but wiry and pale.  He had cut jaw, but round soft cheekbones and big bright eyes ringed with thick lashes.  Dark hair and dimples.  He was covered in tattoos that went all the way around his torso in three scenes that were woven together seamlessly.  He came to me during the break, all smiles and bubbly energy.  We talked about his tattoos and it turned out he was an artist, and I immediately fantasized about him doing one on me.  I told him I liked one scene the best, and I could tell he was a little put out because he thought of it as one piece.  So I tried hastily to recover with, ""I mean, I just like the art on that one, it looks like the other two were done by a different artist.  But I love the way it all fits together, telling a story.""  In my anxiousness, I had leaned in a little, and we got pulled into each other like magnets and all of a sudden we were kissing.  Stone cold sober, so no alcohol to blame it on.  He asked if I wanted a ride back with him and his friend.  I hesitated because there was still another half to the class, but he was not interested in going back because it was boring, said he'd only stuck it out to the break to meet me.  He was right, so I left with him and we went downtown.  Turned out he was unemployed at the moment and looking for work as a bartender, so I took him to the restaurant that I worked at, a place where London hung out a lot and she had gotten me the job.  It was clear that this was the beginning of something amazing.

I fabricate dreams of him
And wake up with reams of him
Swimming and gleaming behind my eyelids
If I did
Every sordid, untoward, high-bid trick
I use to bemuse all the other poor fools
I might just lose this high stakes chance to escape
The panting, circular trail of humdingers and heartbreak
That I can't seem to shake
Lingering palpitations of resuscitated carcasses discarded in my wake
The smell is just too much to take

So I manufacture dreams
In which my heart bursts at the seams
And I dissolve into a torrid stream of 
Punctuated, washed up screams of ecstasy
Because I need.
I want so badly to need him
To feed off him and let my will bleed thin
To feel him creeping underneath my skin
To be subject to his every crushing and succulent whim
I could be good to him,
I know I could

So I construct these dreams of careless caresses
Trying to follow my best guesses as to his wishes and requests
I'll perfect the art of making him happy
Refine and keep it sharp
Because it was a promising start
And if he would let me love him
I would let him break my heart"

I had these costumes for people to wear, but no one liked the costume I picked for them, so I was the only one dressed up and I looked like a dork.  I bought a lot of booze and snacks, when apparently I was supposed to have a full lunch prepared.  Nobody wanted to drink and they called me an alchy.  Also, I was supposed to have set up a daycare thing, and I hadn't known this.  Mothers were yelling at me.

<u>She Said</u>
She said, ""Just because I kissed you doesn't mean I miss you.""
And then the hiss sprang blissfully into my ears
And I could hear the roar
And what's more
I opened my own goddamn sores
With sterilized surgeon's knives
And I let her have the meat inside

She said, ""Just because I missed you doesn't mean I love you.""
And there it was
The melting, butter soft core
Of everything she had in store
The rolling, undulating
Screaming, souped-up, calculating
Crystalline breath on the cold window
Heart-to-heart palpitating
In a depth so vast it was suffocating

""Just because I love you doesn't mean you have me,"" she said
And right then the colors just bled
Right off the walls, under her sultry tread
Right there, instead, I crept/slept/wept my way back to bed
Unrestrained, and finally reaching just the right pitch
Right hand twitching
Left brain completely giving up
Dreams scattered and scuffed, turning red
""Just because I'm here doesn't mean I won't leave,""
she said."

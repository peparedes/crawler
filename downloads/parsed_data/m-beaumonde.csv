<lj-cut text=""Candlelight Carol, by John Rutter""><i>How do you capture the wind on the water?
How do you count all the stars in the sky?
How do you measure the love of a mother?
And how do you write down a baby's first smile?

<b>Candlelight, angel light, firelight and star glow
Shine on his cradle 'til breaking of dawn
Gloria, gloria, in excelsis deo
Angels are singing, the Christ child is born</b>

Find him in Bethlehem, laid in a manger
Christ, our redeemer, asleep on the hay
Nations proclaim him their lord and their saviour
A child with his mother, that first Christmas day

<b>Chorus</b>

Peasants and wise men will kneel and adore him
Seraphim 'round him their vigil will keep
Godhead incarnate and hope of Salvation
But Mary will hold him and sing him to sleep

<b>Chorus</b></i>

This, to me, shows that I think Christmas is really about. People so often think of the birth of Christ as nothing more than a holy moment. But this birth was in some ways like any other: Mary had a child, and she loved him. Though all of the wise men came, though all of the Seraphim appeared in the sky, there is something far more beautiful than all of that put together, and that is the love of a mother given to a child.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""The Jesus Gift, by Gilber Martin""><i>Shall I bring him emeralds?
Shall I bring him gold?
Shall I shower diamonds,
White hard, bright cold?
Shall I spangle jewels
Like stars above?

Bring him laughter
Sweet, peace-filled laughter
Offer him warm laughter and love

Shall I gather emeralds?
Shall I gather gold?
Shall I gather diamonds,
White hard, bright cold?
Shall I gather jewels
Like stars above?

Bring him laughter
Sweet, peace-filled laughter
Offer him warm laughter and love

Bring no emeralds, nor rubies
Silver, nor gold
Neither bright diamonds,
White hard, bright cold
Offer him no jewels
Like stars above

Bring him laughter
Sweet, peace-filled laughter
Offer him warm laughter and love</i>

Another song that always brings a tear to my eye. When I go about the world and see these large, ostentatious churches, or when I see all the hate that has sprung from Christ's word, or how religion has become economized, quantified and priced, I can't help but wonder if Christ would want this. He knows that things like laughter and love are far more precious than any stone or jewel or metal or church. If he can understand, why not others?</lj-cut>

From me to you, and from the bottom of my heart, I wish you a Happy Christmas, Channukah, Ramadan, Winter Solstice, Kwanzaa, or whatever you celeberate, and a very happy New Year.

"event","""Dear"" Father,

Why are you such an arse?

I'd really liked to know the answer. No matter what I do, nothing ever seems to please you. I could be the first wizard to contact intelligent lifeforms out of our galaxy and you would refuse to be impressed because they can't sing or dance. Nothing I could ever do will live up to your impossible standards, so herein lies a suggestion that I truly want you to consider:

<font size=""5""><b>Go fuck yourself.</b></font>

You're a prejudiced git and a merciless bastard. You have a reason to hate everyone, whether it's their breeding or the color of their skin. You're heartless and petty and I, for one, will not mourn you when you die. I can't stand the way you criticize everything: my friends, my schoolwork, my hobbies -- it's too goddamn much, Father, too goddamn much!

I've decided that I don't care anymore. I refuse to even try to please you from this moment forward. I will live my life how I want to, and if you are angered by this, then:

<font size=""5""><b>Go fuck yourself.</b></font>

I'm sick of you. I'm sick of everything you stand for. I'm sick of your ""morals"" -- sick of everything. I can't believe it took me this long to gather enough courage to tell you that I hate you. No, I <i>loathe</i> you. I abhor you, detest you, despise you. You disgust me. I'm finding it harder and harder to believe that I ever was partially of your creation and it took me too long to finally say:

<font size=""5""><b>Go fuck yourself</b></font>

You've broken me, Father. All I have now is this impossible mission to cling to to remind myself of what I am, what I stand for. Thanks to you, it's all I have left, and all I probably ever will have, and now all I have to say to you is:

<font size=""5""><b>Go fuck yourself.</b></font>

You may have won the battle but you haven't won the war. You can hit me as many times as you want but it won't change me. I won't let it change me. Nothing you say will <i>ever</i> change me, so you can:

<font size=""5""><b>Go fuck yourself.</b></font>

I have nothing left to say to you, so you won't hear any objections from me if you were to:

<font size=""5""><b>Go fuck yourself.</b></font>

Go.

Draco doesn't live here anymore.

Go. Away.

"event","The human race is a curios one, indeed. When we are faced with an altercation that we do not understand, our first reaction is to do everything in our power to comprehend it. But there are always going to be times when there will be a question that can't be answered by logic, and that's where things begin to fall apart.

One such question we were unable to answer is ""How was the universe created?"" Indeed, it is a theory that has been argued from a thousand different standpoints over a million years and still, no one has solid evidence. It is, and probably will always be, inconclusive.

That which we do not understand, we fear. Because we don't know it, we can't trust it. And what springs from this fear is one of two things: hate or compensation.

Religion is the largest form of compensation that anyone can find throughout history. When humanity realized that they didn't know how the universe was created, they began to feel insecure and compensated with the idea of God. Yes, God created the universe, the earth, the people and animals.

The idea of God gives us a sense of security and normality. Such as it is, if a man who was raised without knowing the meaning of the word ""religion,"" he would find the whole concept absurd, almost laughable. And yet it has been taken more seriously than almost anything else throughout history and has lead to some of the most vile and nefarious acts of all time.

The Holocaust (though it had many other origins as well) was started primarily to destroy the Jews, upon whom Hitler pinned the reason for Germany's economic struggle, false though it was. The Salem Witch Trials were also based in the belief that one religion said a practice was wrong, but the list goes on: the Spanish Inquisition, the Crusades and the KKK are only some of the felonious results of overzealous religions.

So where, my readers, does one draw the fine line between comforting oneself and incriminating others? It would be fallacious of me to say that it is a matter of black and white when the whole area seems to be a smear of the grayscale.

All religions promise something to their follows. Christians promise Heaven; Buddhists promise reincarnation. If nothing was promised, then religion would be quite a lonely concept. But with this promise there has to come some sort of price. In most case, it is a code of behavior.

Because no two religions are exactly this same, this code of conduct varies greatly from place to place. Christianity has the Bible, Buddhism has the Eight-Fold Path. Wicca has the Rede and Judaism has the Torah. All of these scriptures and all the ones I have failed to mention have one thing in common: how one should live one's life.

If one follows what one's scriptures say, a gift will be in store, whether the gift is good karma or an afterlife in Heaven. If one disobeys one's scripture, there is punishment in store. So doubly, religions instill in us both hope and fear: hope to allure them and fear to make them obey. It is a powerful cycle that, if not regulated, can be deadly.

So, again, where does one draw the line in the shades of gray?

Perhaps no one will ever know.

"event","Well.

I'm hating Snuffy more and more by the minute. She just keeps pushing me into the spotlight. But I got to admit, having a journal seems pretty cool, even if it is on the Intraneet. Content-wise, I haven't the faintest of clues as to what I'm going to put in here, so I honestly don't know why I'm jazzed up about it. I don't know; I never was one to have a diary. A cobination of my paranoia and my certain lack of ability in saying what I want to say combined the right way and kept me from ever creating one.

So that's about the size of things -- if I feel inclined to write something down, I'll probably do it here (not that I have much place else to put it). Please, though, I'm not going to tell you about <i>Pureblood</i> -- if you want spoilers, bother <lj user=""snuffy_supreme"">, not me. I'm just a pawn, I tell you; I don't know what's going on. I'm not sure how often this thing will be updated, either...

Can you add me to your friends? Sure. I probably won't add you back, though. No, no, I'll stick to the only two other <i>Pureblood</i>-related journals, thanks much. Anyway, must run, Shadow's demanding food and I need to go out to get some.

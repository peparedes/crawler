"event","Reading <a href=""http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/index.html"">this</a> is like looking at my childhood.  I was regularly praised by teachers and my parents for being smart, because, well, I was smart.  Unfortunately, I have always relied upon that innate intelligence instead of expanding on it.  At least now I have a better understanding of why.  Yeah, I'm lazy, yeah, I give up too easily.  But now I have a much better idea why, and I want it to change.

So how do I do it?  Yeah, the brain is changeable, but how do I change it?  Any ideas?  The stuff in the article is about how to not fuck up your kids by overpraising them.  Well, I'm already fucked up from it, and I'd bet a lot of the people reading my lj are similar.  So is there some way to work at it to change, other than by totally altering my behaviors, ie, working at stuff I don't like doing because I have no knack for it?  I guess it's time to do some research."

"event","Let's run down the weekend:

<lj user=""stinabat""> came up on Friday to visit and stay with us during a convention.  Unfortunately, she got turned around by the Dallas roads and ended up calling twice for guidance.  Due to my misunderstanding, I ultimately had to drive out to her and guide her in.  We all had a nice visit while she was there after that, tho.

My computer melted down Saturday morning.  Required replacing every component but the hard drives and the case to resolve.  On the plus side, I basically have a new good gaming rig paid for by the company.  Of course, it totally freaked out on Sunday morning, primarily due to the fact that the Intel-standard heatsink wasn't cooling it enough, and it was getting to 100 C, then shutting down.  Another trip to the store for an aftermarket heat sink/fan fixed that.

We had the exterminator and the A/C maintenance guys come in Saturday morning/early afternoon as well.  The exterminator was in and out quickly.  The A/C guys were there for four hours.  The unit had mold in it, and the compressor had corroded through.  We ultimately ended up having to buy an entire new HVAC unit.

During the recent reflooring that resulted from our little flood right before Christmas, they had to pull up the toilets.  I had already put the one in the guest room down, but the one in the master bath sat in our tub until Saturday afternoon.  Karina asked me to get it  down, so I put the wax seal in place, put the toilet in and was fastening the second bolt when there was a sudden ""snap.""  The base of the bolt had corroded through and would need to be replaced before the toilet could be used.  Unfortunately, the only way to replace the bolt is to pull the toilet back up first.  So now it sits, waiting for the unwary that may try to sit on it, until I get a chance to go to Lowe's and pick up a replacement wax seal and bolt kit.

Monday, I had to stay home from work so the A/C guys could come and install the new unit.  They got it all in with no apparent problems, and it did cool the house nicely, while pulling moisture out of the air.  It's quiet, too, which is nice.  Unfortunately, as we found when we woke up this morning, the heating unit doesn't seem to work right.  It was about 60 degrees at 6:30 this morning, and the ""heater"" was running, but it was mostly recirculating cool air and warming it just slightly.  They're supposed to come out tonight and take a look at it.  I think I know what they messed up, so it should be about a ten minute fix, I hope."

Karina and I had a coup el of friends over on Sunday and we ended up spending something like four hours just playing Wii Sports. the game that comes with the system.  I also picked up the new Legend of Zelda game, but, honestly, as much fun as it is, I think I'm going to be on Wii Sports for a few days, even as simple as it is.

So, in all, great system.  Oh, and you don't need a memory card if you decide to get one.  There's enough on-system memory to keep you happy for a little while.  Also, grab an extra controller and nunchuk, because the system is tons more fun if you can play with other folks.  The only thing I haven't liked so far is that the wireless seems touchy.  I may be switching to a wired connection for it."

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A poll worker was arrested Tuesday and charged with assault and interfering with an election for allegedly choking a voter and pushing the voter out the door, an official said.

Election officials called police, and the voter wanted to file charges, said Paula McCraney, a spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Clerk. 

""That about tops off the day,"" McCraney said.

It wasn't immediately clear what sparked the altercation. The name of the poll worker was not released and a Louisville police spokesman did not immediately return calls seeking comment."

"event","This neuroscience class is kicking the crap out of me.  Since I've gone back to school, I've never gotten a C on a test until the first test in this Intro Neuroscience class.  Of course, given that the class average on the test required a 14 point curve, the fact that I finally ended up with a 79 isn't too awful, but I think it's becoming clear to me that I do not belong in a scientific field.  There's way too much memorization with very little synthesis, and I honestly am just not good at that.  However, I'll stick the class out til at least the second test and see how I do then.  As it stands, tho, unless I do incredibly well on the next test, I'm probably going to end up dropping and going to my second choice of majors, Government and Politics.  Almost everyone I know said that would probably be a better fit for me, but I wanted to try this and see.  And now I know."

<lj-cut text=""Details (and glossary for non-WoW folks) behind cut"">
This all happened on the Kul Tiras server.

Glossary:
Horde/Alliance - the two opposing factions in WoW
flagged - able to engage in Player vs. Player combat.  A player must either A) attack an already flagged player from the opposing faction or B) type in /pvp to turn their flag on.  After a few minutes, the player will ""unflag"" if they don't attack another player
Stromgarde - a small area in the Arathi Highlands zone
Battlegrounds - pvp-specific zones with capture the flag and similar types of games

And our cast of players:
Felen - me
Daranoris and Amynthis - morons
Kyras - an innocent bystander

<font color=""purple"">Purple text is private messages</font>

[4. LookingForGroup] [Daranoris]: HORDE 60'S ATTACKING 30S IN STORMEGARDE
[4. LookingForGroup] [Felen]: Then, ah, maybe the 30s shouldn't have flagged?
[4. LookingForGroup] [Daranoris]: hey, accidents happen
[4. LookingForGroup] [Amynthis]: Shut up and fight you pussy
[4. LookingForGroup] [Daranoris]: see, this guy is why horde always win
[4. LookingForGroup] [Felen]: Because I don't flag for no damned reason when there's 60s around?
[4. LookingForGroup] [Daranoris]: no cuz you're spineless
[4. LookingForGroup] [Daranoris]: go joing the horde
[4. LookingForGroup] [Felen]: Bahahah spineless.
[4. LookingForGroup] [Felen]: OMG it takes so much bravery to flag on and get beaten down!
[4. LookingForGroup] [Amynthis]: he wasn't here he was called here after we took two out but when we need help and call out we get fucked that's why he said Horde will always win
<font color=""purple"">[Daranoris] whispers: you're worthless as a bent dick
To [Daranoris]: Bahahah
To [Daranoris]: Man, you're just unbelievably dumb and whiny.  ""Wah! I decided to participate in PvP and now I'm losing! It's all the fault of the guy that chooses not to join in!""
[Daranoris] whispers: yep, you're the reason Horde wins
To [Daranoris]: Here's a clue, chief.  The Horde and Alliance don't ""win.""  There's no winning in PvP outside the battlegrounds.  There's just gank and countergank, and I've got better things to do with my time.  If I want PvP, I'll go into Warsong Gulch.
[Daranoris] whispers: then why say anything? <b>you're the kind of guy i beat the eff out of in real ife</b></font> (emphasis mine)
<font color=""purple"">To [Daranoris]: Sure you do, chief.  I'm sure you're just Billy Badass in real life.
To [Daranoris]: Sorry about the shortcomings you feel the need to cover up for.
[Daranoris] whispers: as long as you know you're wothless
[Daranoris] whispers: <b>if i find you i'll beat you too</b></font> (emphasis mine)
<font color=""purple"">To [Daranoris]: What are you, 12?
[Daranoris] whispers: you must be
[Daranoris] whispers: puss</font>
[4. LookingForGroup] [Felen]: Great moments in Alliance history: Daranoris threatening to find another player and beat him up.  In real life.
[4. LookingForGroup] [Amynthis]: shut up fag
[4. LookingForGroup] [Kyras] i/gnore amynthis
[4. LookingForGroup] [Felen]: Fag?  It gets better and better.  It's like playing Counterstrike all over again.
[4. LookingForGroup] [Felen]: Next someone will threaten to banz0r me and then my day will be complete.

So, to avoid this problem, I started up http://comicbookhoedown.blogspot.com, syndicated at <lj user=""comichoedown""> for those of you that might care to read it.  There's only like 2 even halfway useful posts there right now, but there'll be more stuff later."

"event","I got 3 As (Art Appreciation, Composition 2, American History 2).  They should have all ben blowoff classes, but they all graded on attendance (which I'm horrible about) and the History teacher is one of those ""I don't give As unless you've <u>earned</u> them"" where earned means ""until you can actually argue positions about it rather than listing dates and times,"" which is fine.  I think I was one of two people in a 30 person class that walked out with an A.

At any rate, I'm taking this semester off and applying to UTD, where I should be from fall 06 through spring 09 or 10 finishing up my degree.  Hoo-ray."

I finally, finally finished up last night with the last of the English papers, except for the bibliography, which I'm tacking on now.  That just leaves the finals, and I'm done.

There's a bunch more cleaning to do (we've only done the office and the bedroom so far), so expect to see another list or two before this is all over.  Upcoming goodies should include some workout gear, possibly more old gaming systems, old DVD players and some other stuff.  If y'all don't take it, it's going to charity.

Other than that, things have been pretty quiet.  We went to a Halloween party last weekend as zombies. School is going well, although my history teacher is one of those types that is extremely reluctant to give an A, so that may be my first B in a long time.  In our downtime, I've been playing City Of Villains mostly, while Karina's largely been keeping with her City of Heroes characters, so I see an upcoming conflict there.  One in which I shall ""pwnz"" her, as the kids say."

<TD>Roman military and political leader. He was instrumental in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. His conquest of Gallia Comata extended the Roman world all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, introducing Roman influence into what has become modern France, an accomplishment of which direct consequences are visible to this day. In 55 BC Caesar launched the first Roman invasion of Britain. Caesar fought and won a civil war which left him undisputed master of the Roman world, and began extensive reforms of Roman society and government. He was proclaimed dictator for life, and heavily centralized the already faltering government of the weak Republic. Caesar's friend Marcus Brutus conspired with others to assassinate Caesar in hopes of saving the Republic. The dramatic assassination on the Ides of March was the catalyst for a second set of civil wars, which marked the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire under Caesar's grand-nephew and adopted son Octavian, later known as Caesar Augustus. Caesar's military campaigns are known in detail from his own written Commentaries (Commentarii), and many details of his life are recorded by later historians such as Suetonius, Plutarch, and Cassius Dio. </TD></TR>

"event","So I've been playing UrbanDead.com as three characters, a firefighter, a consumer-turned-medic, and a zombie.  My favorite moment of the game so far happened this morning, on my zombie, Undead Jed.  Humans can hide in buildings and have several ways to avoid letting zombies in.  The easiest is to close the door, but zombies can buy a skill that lets them ""remember"" how to open doors.  Humans can buy a ""construction"" skill that lets them build barricades.  The barricades can be attacked and torn down, but they're usually pretty sturdy.  However, I had plenty of turns this morning, so I decided to have a go at it.  I ended up tearing down a strong barricade and getting into a hospital full of largely low level survivors.  After gnawing on the only guy in the room with the construction skill for a bit, I ran out of turns.  The following exchange happened while I was waiting for my turns to accumulate:

Mr Transistor attacked you for 3 damage. (08-11 18:41 GMT)
Mr Transistor attacked you for 3 damage. (08-11 18:42 GMT)
Mr Transistor said ""Get the zombie or get the hell out!"" (08-11 18:43 GMT)
Lamantine said ""This is odd,no zombies are outside. This one must have destroyed the barricade all by himself."" (08-11 19:00 GMT)
Lamantine attacked you for 3 damage. (08-11 19:00 GMT)
Mr Transistor attacked you for 3 damage. (08-11 19:05 GMT)
Mr Transistor attacked you for 3 damage. (08-11 19:11 GMT)
Mr Transistor attacked you for 3 damage. (08-11 19:33 GMT)

I just about died laughing.  Both of them fled the building, but there's still plenty of snacks inside the hospital with Jed.  Mmmmm.  Braaaaaains.

I was going to ignore the Death Rattle skill (lets a zombie sort of talk) until later, but I might buy it just to mess with them."

Turn based, web based MMO zombie survival scenario.  Still needs some work, like a trading system between players, but fun nonetheless.  I'm in the Dulston suburb as BitterCupOJoe."

                 You are the most embarrassing element of them all.  You are much worse than sweaty backs on sunny days or snowflakes in the hair or mascara running down your face in the rain.  I want you to know that I did not appreciate your little shenanigans downtown today, you little brat!
And neither did he:  

<img src=""http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/aim/a_notes/p_anims/wind_walk_start.gif"" />

But at least he's wearing pants.
Listen, I can handle walking at a 45 degree angle.  I can handle walking-but not going anywhere!- even in the middle of a crosswalk while all the cars are waiting and watching and honking at your fruitless struggle just to move an inch.  I can handle being blinded by my hair whipping across my face and being hit with stray pieces of papers that fly through the air and cling to you.
But what I can't handle is HAVING MY SKIRT BLOWN UP TO MY NECK all up and down Michigan avenue!  Jerk.  It's very humiliating.  And everybody stares.  And you just sit there laughing and orchestrating the madness, don't you Wind?  I bet you're like, 14 years old in element years.  And you have acne and keep pet rats in an empty aquarium.  And you have old posters of Heather Locklear hung up on your door.  And you smoke out your bedroom window.  And you and your friends pop the head's off your sisters barbies and arrange them on the picket fence spikes all around the dreamhouse.  Or maybe that's my brother.

Anyways, one day some other lady-some more motivated lady-who has been a victim of your cruelty and unintentionally flashed her butt to an entire city is going to seek revenge on you.  I don't know what she's going to do BUT it's going to be great.  And you are going to cry.  And I am going to applaud."

So, we got there and everything was locked up but we could still walk around and look at the outside and the long stone stairs that people walk up ON THEIR KNEES.

I wish I could show you a picture of all this.


I've got this:

but that's about it.

BECAUSE whenever I'd try to take a picture next to the grotto, shrine, or cross-my camera would black out.  I'd press the button and NOTHING!  The screen would just go dark.  Everything else would be fine but nothing SACRED could be captured.

Are you scared?  
No, you're probably a cynic.
BUT lets see what happens when I take my camera to the virgin mary salt stain on the highway overpass...

"event","One trick that zookeepers have used to get male pandas interested in mating with dowdier females (according to a December dispatch from Sichuan, China, in Australia's The Age) is to let an attractive female roam around a pen, leaving her scent, and then, in darkness, with the male in the pen and frisky at the scent, to introduce the less attractive female into the pen, back-end first, so that the pre-excited male will quickly begin copulating. Said zookeeper Zhang Hemin, ""When the males find out (that they've just mated with unintended partners), they get very angry and start fighting the female. We have had to use firecrackers and a water hose to separate them."" [The Age (Melbourne), 12-17-06]"

This means:
No more stupid uniform!
No more having to smile and say ok when people want to change tables because it's too cold, too sunny, too dark, too noisy, too hot, too ""in the corner"", too ""In the middle"", too wobbly, too tall, and, my favorite, around too many old people!
No more being encircled in cigar smoke without the option of walking away!
No more drunkies staring at the shirt and asking what 312 stands for...and then staring at the shirt some more!
No more lugging kegs upstairs!
No more checking the bathrooms every half hour!
No more walking through the beer flooded brewery!
No more pretending like I think people's little kids are cute and charming!

I did have my most challenging moment, last night, out of the 8 months I've worked there.
I carried a huge tray full of 65 teetering salt and peppers-65!-through the crowded bar and managed to sidestep every drunk jerk, every cigarette waving in the air, and every spilt beer puddle, AND I didn't drop one!  Not a one!
And when you think about this: keep in mind that that's really heavy and I am neither a strong nor graceful person.

And I was thankful for that.
Because thats kinda embarassing and probably reveals traits about me that most sucessful people do not share.
But maybe I should just BE MYSELF (and if I was the sort of person who liked to use the phrase, ""Let my freak flag fly"" I would put that right here but I would probably do something cute with it like, ""Let my View flag fly"" or Rosie flag or Barbara Walters flag or, my favorite; let my Elizabeth Hasselback flag fly...BUT I am not that sort of person and I actually REALLY hate that phrase and feel REALLY uncomfortable when someone uses it in earnest or even in irony, which thankfully isn't that often but, nonetheless, it still happens too often and I think it should stop).

"event","I was awoken at 2AM by my carbon monoxide alarm.  Knowing nothing about carbon monoxide(except for it's nickname-the silent killer-which btw might make for a good halloween costume) and being somewhat neurotic in these situations due to 1)-once living in an apartment building that was burining down and being so groggy from the fumes that I slept though the firemen pounding down the doors-and then told them that to wake me up in 5 minutes  2)-growing up with an insanely cautious mother who instilled in me the fear of everything from drinking out of aluminum to talking on cell phones at the gas station.  
I pressed the test button on the alarm and it stopped beeping.  I read the instructions and it basically said that if you felt sick to DEFINATELY get out of the house and call the fire dept.  If you didn't feel sick (I didn't) then you should open the windows and PROBABLY get out of the house and call the fire dept.  
I was so tired.  Too tired to leave the house or call the fire dept. (Though I did call and wake up Tom and then got mad when he said, half asleep, ""Um, I don't know what to do about that.  Want me to call you later?""
I opened the windows and unplugged EVERYTHING and turned off the heater and tried to go back to sleep.  Don't forget that IT IS COLD HERE!  Espcecially without the heater on and SUPER especially with the windows open.  I set my alarm to wake me up every hour because the internet told me that if you get carbon monoxide poisoning then you will basically be rendered retarded and unable to get yourself out of the house and to fresh air.  So I'd wake up, check on the cats to see if they were dead yet and then go back to sleep. For another hour.
Needless to say-I'm still alive.  But I'm so very, very tired.

I'm guessing this is karma for calling in sick to work yesterday with a twisted ankle."

"event","There once was a time, a glorious sun saturated era of carefree abandon and forbidden thrills, when my friends and I really liked to shoplift.  
Well, not all of us did it, some were braver/stupider than others but it seemed like everyone was along for the ride.  The NS-ers (Non-Stealers) would receive a sort of contact high from the crime and the S-ers liked to have them around to witness their bad-ass rebellion.  Because when you're stealing for street cred, what's the point of doing it when your friends aren't around to watch you BEING REALLY COOL?  

I was partial to thieving from Nordstrom's Brass Plum, and for whatever reason, the bead store.  I still remember that feeling of reaching my hand into the buckets of beads and clutching a fistfull of beads THAT I DIDN'T EVEN WANT and letting them slip down my sleeves, pouring into my bag.  
I had one friend in particular- she was quite skilled and would steal FOR YOU!  WHATEVER YOU WANTED!  I remember she got me a GAP velvet blue blazer(that my mom loved!) and a pink angora sweater from the Nordstrom's old lady dept (I think I thought it was lisa loeb-ish cool).
Anyways, what I'm saying is that it was just a REAL ADVANTAGEOUS time for us all.
Somewhere along the way, I became jaded.  The thought of slipping past security with my bounty in tow became unappealing.  Too much work.  Too scary.

BUT SOME OF YOU STILL DO IT!  I know it!  A-what I imagine to be- small fraction of you have even admitted it to me.  And I figure that means even more of you STILL do it but just keep it a secret.  Now, I'm not saying this is bad.  BY NO MEANS!  I accept and even applaud you!  And I would never judge you for it.  Why?  Because we're friends, that's why!  Friends do things for eachother.  Nice things.  Like not judging.  Or maybe even like walking into Anthropologie and stealing this:
<img src=""http://lulusvintage.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/anthro5_1.jpg"" />

And I also like the white bell song cardigan/jacket.  The one with all the different sized buttons, OK?

And listen, S-er, you don't even have to tell me you stole it!   You could be like, ""Hey, I bought you this!""  and I'll be like, ""Woah!  How nice of you friend!  Thank you for trying to make me happy with material objects!  Really, what I cherish the most is your frienship but I will accept this gift nonetheless!"" OR you could even just send it to me anonymously!  And when people would say to me, ""You spent $300 dollars on a simple A-line dress?""  I'd say, ""Yeah!  AND I spent $200 dollars on this cardigan/jacket, too!  Now stop being so jealous of me!  My friends would never shoplift!  They are just like your friends!  Just as good!  Even gooder!  Leave me alone!""

See?  Now  you have a mission.  A little project to work on!  Fun, huh?  
Love you S-er friends!  Love you more than the NS-er friends because you're better!"

                   WHAT THE FUCK do you think you're doing?!?  (And Winter?  I don't even swear unless I really REALLY mean it)

                   Do you even know what date it is today, Winter?  It's October 12th- it's not December 1st, it's not even NOVEMBER 1st!  SO WHY IS IT, Winter, that I wake up today and it's SNOWING?  Huh?  Can you answer me that?

                   And, as if the snow wasn't bad enough, Winter, you also HAILED on me!  And you didn't just hail on ME, no-you hailed on little babies and grandmas with bad hips and single pregnant women and friendless autistic kids and unemployed parents with no health insurance and teenagers with acne who just got caught shoplifting and  guys who go to great extremes to pick out t-shirts that will show off their tribal armband tatoos that they got a decade ago and really, Winter, don't you think we've got enough problems in our lives that we don't need YOU hurling little pieces of rock hard ICE at our heads?  Not in early October, Winter. NOT IN EARLY OCTOBER. 

                   So, honestly, what's going on?  At first I thought, ""Well, maybe Fall called in sick for the day and Winter was just being a nice guy and decided to help out.  OR MAYBE Winter went out partying the night before with Summer and Spring-you know, all the off season dudes kickin' back a few Miller Lites and playing some air hockey-and then Winter woke up STILL DRUNK and was all, 'Goddamn it!  I'm late for work!"" because, well, I've done that before.""  BUT THEN I turned on the news and GUESS WHAT WINTER-you're around all week! Or maybe even FOREVER!  Only YOU know for sure, I suppose.

 Are you an egomaniac?  Are you a bully?  Are you a workaholic?  I just don't know, Winter.  Do you think you don't get enough attention?  It's not like you're one of those, ""Transition Seasons,"" like Fall or Spring...you and Summer-you guys are the heavy hitters and NOBODYS denying that.  So what are you doing stepping all over Falls toes?  I like Fall.  I LOVE Fall and you've taken it away from me!  What are Fall-Clothes going to think about this?  They're going to feel more than a little abandoned, thats for sure!  You just gave Fall-Clothes a complex.  Thanks a lot Winter, WAY TO RUIN EVERYTHING!

What's that?  Did you just cough and  call me a, ""California Pussy""?!?   AND BY THE WAY-don't say, ""pussy"".  It makes you sound like the little 5th grader who is desperately trying to fit in with the cool kids even though he keeps getting denied because of his rough edges.  You know, the one who doesn't have any other choice but to bite the bullet and smoke pot with the weird 8th graders.  

Is that it, Winter?  Do you have a drug problem?

Look me in the eyes, Winter!  Oh, don't even try to tell me that you have, ""Cat Allergies""!  
Oh, Spring has 4 cats?  Well, what are their names?  Snowball, Blackie, Cat Ears, and Paw Feet?  Reaaaallly?   Do you think I was born yesterday, Winter?  Well then, I'll just have to call Spring's parents and find out about that!  What's that?  They don't have a phone?  Spring's Dad just got laid off from the dry cleaner factory? There's not even a dry cleaner factory.  It's called the DRY CLEANERS!

 Wint'r, please!

Hey are you crying?  Are you OK, Winter?  Well, OK, maybe I WAS a bit harsh.  Hey, stop.  I'm sorry!  Well, fine, I guess I don't understand the pressure you're under.  You're right, things have changed.  Listen, don't walk away.  We can work this out, Winter!  I didn't mean to hurt you.  I guess you're right, maybe I do have some trust issues.  I didn't think about it like that.  

So, we're cool?  Yeah?   OK.  I'll see you tomorrow, Winter!"

It's difficult deciding what content is appropriate for kids, what's gonna interest them, what's gonna bore them, and what they will understand.  My teacher keeps telling us to, ""Remember""  Well, in an attempt to, ""remember,"" I unearthed some of my old writings.
And now...
A few exerpts from my 3rd grade journal:

""Jan 19th, 1987
Yesterday I was suppos to have scosser practice.  But I hid the paper.  Marissa wented yesterday.  she said she was going to.  I hated to sit next to Preston.  But now I get to sit next to Ambr.  Sometimes she reaches in my desk and pulls things out.  Now I put all thos little things in the back of my desk.  Yesterday I had scosor practice.""

""Feb 1
Today I forot to bring Jenifors string.  I was going to bring anothr sea book.  It is nice.  Katie B. just told me that Davin loves Mrissa.  At reces I play with Amber, Beth, Alyssa.  Dylan tries to get the rubberban chain from us.""

""Feb 17th
Yesterday we went on a boat.  Some times I got to steer the boat.  It was really fun.  Then I got a realy bad throught.  I had to go to the docter.  I had smethems.  Now I had to take medsen.  Boo!""

""Feb 19th
Today is Mrissasa birthday.  I realy doon't like Ambr.  yesterda day my eraser fell off.  well it sort of broke in the midle but it didn't fall off.  (insert drawing of a sort of broken off eraser)  and then mrissa said to put soome eyes on it so it is like a packman.  The next day Ambr said when she saw it ""O i usto do that.  it's dumb.""

""Ambr A steals stuff.  When I sat next to her she stole my rubbr eraser.  it was on my desk and I came back it wasnt there.  I said Ambr I know you took it.  She said no.  so I kind of rased my hand.  then she said close your eyes so I did but I peacked.  She had it in her coat.  Then my markers!  I told her she could yuse them so she took them home(she wasnt suposed to) The next day I could not find them.  I asked her if she had it.  She said No.  So I told the teacher.  She asked me if someone brooed them.  I said Ambr did.  She called Ambr and asked if she had them.  Then Ambr said, ""Yes I have them at my store.""  then the teacher said ""O.  She said you could brow them.  And other stuff.""  Amber also stold my marker.  I let her use it to write her name and I saw it in her desk.""

""March 21, 1988
I went on a fildtrip.  It was fun.  We saw whales.  We saw dolphins too.  We also saw a lot of sea lions!  I got realy wet.  I also held a sea urnschins.  There were 3 starfish.  It was at anicapaca.  It was from 7:10-7:00.  I took two pichers.  I am glad this is my last page.  It will be my 3rd journal."""

"event","OK.  So.
Tom and I were driving in the car, eating this cheese, crackers, and sausage plate thing from my work.  It had those little pickles on it, so I gave one to Tom and asked if he liked them.  He took a bite, thought about it and said, ""No, I don't.  This is gross.""
I said, ""Yeah, they're kinda like grandma food, huh?""
He made a face and said, ""Yuck.  I wish you hadn't of said that while I was eating.""
Then, in an attempt to gross him out even further I said, ""Grandma butts.""
He looked annoyed.  Then he asked if we had any water in the front seat. 
 I said, ""No.  No water,""  I held up a bottle of water, ""but we DO have grandma butts and you can have some as soon as you ask for it by name.""
He was exhausted with me.  ""C'mon.  Give me the water.""
""Oh!  You mean the grandma butts.""  I nodded encouragingly at him.
He stole the water from me and took a sip.  Not amused.
""Nothing like some cold grandma butts after a little pickle lunch, huh?""  
He sighed, ""OK.  You can go ahead and call water, 'grandma butts,' as much as you like.""  I think this was some sort of attempt at reverse psychology but getting him to finally say it  only fueled my juvenile laughter.
Then I asked him, ""Do you feel like you're DATING me or BABYSITTING me?""
He said, ""A little of both."""

""I found that bitch!""  

It's a little heartless and I'd be mad if that was my cat but...
Picture it.
It makes me laugh EVERY TIME.


I wish I saw the person when they did it.  I wonder if they were drunk or alone or were all scared and looking over their shoulder as they did it, totally laughing to themselves.
I'd be.  Then I'd go home and I'd make myself little awards and certificates which would read, ""THEE FUNNIEST POSTER DEFACER EVER!""

"event","I am referring, of course, to South Central Illinois, a region which Tom and I drove through this weekend on our way to Tennessee to see Loretta Lynn.
Now, I admit I've worn some pretty silly clothes(yes, some even made with animal prints and PVC) that would've evoked stares and comments anywhere (and they did) BUT-let me remind you-that was a long time ago.  These days I'm much more above the radar...under the radar?  You know, my hair is a natural color and I don't have glitter all over my face.  NORMAL.
Well, I guess what I consider normal others consider drop-your-fork-on-your-plate-scream-out-a-car-window-shake-your-head-in-wonderment-CRAZY!
Grey jumper, black top, and red tights.  
I guess it was the red tights.  But I even braided my hair and pinned it to the top of my head in an attempt to look like I just came back from milking cows on the farm.  In red tights.  
Man.  They just could not get over that.  Every place we walked into fell silent.  All eyes were directed towards my knees.  A few brave souls asked us where we were from but, for the most part, we (meaning: me) just received TRULY UNRELENTING suspicious and judgmental stares.
OH! And one teeny tiny diner we walked into-right when we stepped in-this old man went ""UH OH!""  And not in the joke way.  In the we're gonna rob the place or we're teach their grandchildren about tolerance way.
OH!  And some kids drove by us and screamed out the window, ""REPENT!  JESUS CHRIST IS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR!""  And then they peeled away dying with laughter.
And we were only a few hours outside of the city when we stopped at a chilis (In case you're judging: It was that or long john silvers) and I heard the first unsettling comment.  The family next to us- well, the mom was telling the sons about how their dad had to get his truck fixed (the dad was just standing there frowning) and he took it to this guy and the guy is really slow fixing it and he's had it for a week...AND...she leans in and whispers(LOUDLY!)... AND...he's black!  The sons push back from the table and let out some chuckles while shaking their heads.  I gave them a startled glance and a baffled laugh at just...how weird it was and because a part of me thought I must've heard wrong.  The mom caught my eye and smiled at me.  Like we were on the same team.

I was sitting down; she couldn't see my tights."

Now calm down for a second and take a seat.

My name's Katie.  A awhile ago my friend, Carrie Grucz and I asked you to sponsor our road trip across America.  Just two girls, on the road, stopping at every roadside attraction, tiny town, and landmark we could find.  A voyage to find the real America, a voyage, Oprah, to find OURSELVES.

<img src=""http://cache.gridskipper.com/travel/oprah-still-pissed.jpg"" />
Don't act like you don't remember.


You see, we sat there and racked our brains thinking of every kind hearted philanthropist who would help us with our travels.  And then it hit us...OPRAH!
Oprah loves female friendships!  Oprah loves voyages to find innerselves!  Oprah loves to share her enormous wealth!
So with our young hearts full of hope, we wrote you a letter.  And for the record, Oprah, we weren't just asking for your money, we were asking for your support and approval. 
Well, guess what?  We got that support and approval...but not from you.  We got it from Polaroid.  Polaroid, Oprah.  Do you know what they deal with?  I'll tell you: cameras and film.  Cameras and film, NOT matters of the heart.  And, apparently Oprah, neither do you.

Stop showing off your little string bracelet, Oprah.  You are NOT going to derail this train with your little distraction techniques.
<img src=""http://www.94xfm.com/images/OPRAH.jpg"" />

It is nice though...    Did you make it yourself?   Really?  What sort of clasp did you use?  A lobster clasp?  Nice. 

Woah!  Damn you!  Back to the letter!

So, you never wrote us back.  But we did not turn our backs on you.  We'd still watch your little show and flip through copies of O at the checkout aisles.
""She's a busy lady,"" we reasoned as we checked our empty mailboxes.  ""She's probably off building schools for girls in Africa, re-watching The Color Purple, spelling her name backwards, or hanging out with Stedman.""  I even read that sappy Jane Hamilton book that you were trying to make the whole world read.  And alright, it was assigned to me, but I still read it nonetheless.
Do you see what I'm saying here Oprah?  We gave you a second chance.  Everybody deserves a second chance, right?
 
Well, NOT YOU, Oprah Winfrey!

Would you like to know what I heard the other day?  No?  Well imagine that!  The queen of talk dosen't know how to listen.  Now, sit back down.

<img src=""http://www.putpix.com/a/165/oprah.jpg"" />
What?!?  OH MY GOD, Oprah!  What are you doing?  Put that down!  Is THAT your sense of humor?  Thats's not funny! That's just stupid.  And weird. And kinda retarded.  No more caffeine for you, Oprah! Weirdo...


 Now start paying attention-we're getting to the good part.

So yesterday I hear that you and Gayle King are embarking on a new project.  A feature of just two girls, on the road, stopping at every roadside attraction, tiny town, and landmark they can find.  A voyage to find the real America, a voyage to find THEMSELVES.

Sound familiar? 

Not cool, Opes.  Not.  Cool.

Now, I don't want to hear your little excuses, your little LIES.  I suppose a person who has reached your heights of success must be a little ruthless. 

 But really, Oprah, couldn't you have saved your cunningness for the boardroom?

What's that?  Well, yes, you're right; it HAS been years since we sent you that letter.  But you know what?  I NEVER TOLD YOU WHEN WE SENT YOU THAT LETTER SO YOU JUST ADMITTED YOUR OWN GUILT, OPRAH!  You  fell right into that trap! HAHAHAHA!
<img src=""http://dallaspenn.com/pics/albums/album02/oprah.sized.jpg"" />

Seriously, Oprah.  Don't even try to blame this on poor Gayle! That's just pathetic.   Look at her, she doesn't have a mean bone in her body.  
<img src=""http://www.everythingoscar.com/gking2.gif"" />
 She just got messed up with the wrong crowd (ie: you!) If I was a betting woman, I'd say Gayle got talked into stealing our idea by some very sneaky little talk show host.. 
Oprah Winfrey calls the shots in that relationship; and the WHOLE WORLD knows it!
And to think of how you persecuted that James Frey character for heralding his fiction as non-fiction like you were some championeer of truth!
Yeah, I am shaking my head at you.  But it's not out of anger; it's disappointment, Oprah, pure, 100%, sheer heart sinking disappointment.

<img src=""http://www.590klbj.com/EI/T/Pics/Channels/KLBJ-AM/OPRAH.bmp"" />
Listen, I don't want your apologies.  You're not sorry.  You're only sorry you got caught!
What I do want are some tickets to your, ""Favorite Things,"" show.  It's not gonna make things right between us, Oprah, but at least we'll be approaching some parity.

You can go now.  And take that weird sign with you."

"event","have become my two biggest problems as of late.
          
                                         I OBVIOUSLY have a very difficult life.

Anyways, I have recently jumped on the Lost bandwagon and I am currently nothing short of obsessed.  I have a stack of blockbuster dvds that, when piled up, reach up to my knees.  I've started switching up the video stores I go to so I don't get tagged as the creepy lost girl.  Every night I fall asleep to something like my 4th episode in a day and IT DOSEN'T STOP THERE.  Lost has infiltrated my dreams.  Every night, for the past two weeks, I have dreamt, with little variation, of stranded-on-a-deserted-island situations (last night Krista was on the island).  
Now, I know that they place fake commercials in with the regular ones during broadcast, but I wonder if they have some sort of subliminal messages encoded in the episodes which make you 100 percent crazy obsessed with it, because when I start to think about how the third season begins SO SOON and I'm only on the second disc of the second season a mild sense of panic spreads through my body.

In slightly more embarassing news:  I sold a pair of boots on ebay to some girl.  This was awhile ago.  I forgot to send them out before I went on my california trip so when I got back I wrote her an I'm sorry its so late email and put a ten dollar bag of adorable vintage candy in the box as an apology.  
She was very nice about it.
But then I started getting emails from her saying she hadn't recieved the boots.  I kept asking her to wait because the chicago mail system is notoriously incompitent.  I usually drive out to the suburbs to insure whatever I'm sending arrives where it's going safely, or just arrives there at all.  This time, however, I did not.
She was very nice about it; even saying it was OK because, ""it was still too hot in kansas to wear them.""
But then, after weeks, she asked for a refund.  Because she had been so nice, I gave her her refund while silently cursing every mailman/lady/carrier in the Chicagoland area.
More weeks went by...
And then yesterday I come home to The Box sitting on my doorstep.  I got mailed back to me!  The stamp across the address read ""No Address Exists"".
Well, such address didn't exist , as I was horrified to realize upon inspection BECAUSE I HAS ADDRESSED IT TO EBAY'S SAMPLE ADDRESS!!!  Really.  I mean, I know I was in a hurry and everything when I copied it onto the box but the name I had written out in pink sharpie was JONATHAN DOE.  Jonathan. Doe.  What was I thinking?
It was probably something about Lost.
Absent mindedly yours, Katie

Oh, by the way: can you guys see my pictures?  Because I can't."

"event","and although I still prefer Teen Vogue over regular Vogue, I am proud to say that I have been around for TWENTY-SEVEN years!

And even though I rung in my birthday with the tenderest of sore throats, the raspiest of old smoker's voices, the feeling of screws being tortuously twisted into my skull, and a bottle of NyQuil for breakfast-it was still a pretty good day.  I paid slight reverence to the sneak attack flu by staying in bed and watching 4 straight hours of Arrested Development and then, like, 12 more hours watching Once Upon A Time in America.

The days highlights included: pumpkin pancakes with whipped creme and caramel, the presentation of my present from Tom (a Tennessee trip to see Loretta Lynn AND trapeze lessons!!!), lovely calls and emails from my friends across the country, and the process of trying on my new anthropologie dress over and over again.
Somewhere around the third try-on, I decided that I was going to pull my weak, feverish self together and go to my own birthday party.

And when I learn to post pictures, I'll show you what it looks like to be Twenty-Seven.  Unless, you already know and, in that case, me and you can share all the inside jokes and secrets and presents that Twenty-Seven year olds do."

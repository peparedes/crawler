"event","&nbsp;Music plays a big part in my writing process and since I'm itching to write again, I've been pondering what music does Bruce Banner listen to. It's obvious what Tony listens to, we're bombarded with it in the Iron Man and Avengers movies... So for the first time, I've downloaded AC/DC and Black Sabbath. (Sorry, my love for science boyfriends won't get past my dislike for Metallica.)<div>&nbsp;</div><div>But back to Bruce, my first thought was Clash/Sex Pistols/Siouxsie but then I think I'm writing Mark Ruffalos Bruce here not Norton or Bana Bruce (and let's face it, it's all about Mark Ruffalo for me). Which brought me to Cat Stevens &amp; Fleetwood Mac(thanks, rock and roll hall of fame visit) but to me Bruce isn't much older than myself and I didn't listen to them when I was younger... So that brought me to the Talking Heads but I'm still iffy on it..</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>So I welcome any thoughts, music recs, etc.</div>"

"event","<div>I had a long conversation with the vet tech today and got some answers about her surgery next Monday. (Now that I'm slightly more rational.) Nim does have a mast cell tumor which is a form of skin cancer. &nbsp;They will remove it and some of the surrounding tissue to make sure they get it all. The biopsy will take 7 - 10 days. &nbsp;Either the vet tech or the doctor will call with the results -- what stage the tumor was. (The doctor will be bad &nbsp;news of course. So we can discuss the next steps.)</div> 	<div>&nbsp;</div> 	<div>So between now and then I have to figure out Nims aftercare during the day. The worst case scenario is that she goes to the vets during the day. (Nim is not fond of the vets and I don't really want to put her through that if I can help it.) A slightly better scenario is having her day care take her and put her in a suite by herself. At least there she will be with people she knows well. The best case scenario is some combination of myself, my mom, Chris, and any other person I can wrangle into helping out by taking care of her at home during the day. (It really sucks that this is all happening while John is at home taking care of Fred &amp; Kipper.)</div> 	<div>&nbsp;</div> 	<div>Right now, I'm doing okay. Because it finally sunk in that Nim is strong and crazy girl who will fight this like crazy and so am I. <br /><br />I also want to thank everyone for their well wishes, they've helped. Please keep us in your thoughts over the next few weeks.<br /> 		<div>&nbsp;</div> 		<div>&nbsp;</div></div>"

"event","&nbsp;So Yesterday, &nbsp;I took Nim to the Vet. I was fully expecting to get a lecture about her weight. &nbsp;Instead, she looked at the bump on her side and decided to aspirate it to be safe. She took the sample and came back and told me that it was a malignant tumor that needed to be removed. I'm sure she told me what type of tumor but I can't remember. Everything seemed to crash down. I think it's mast cell but I can't be positive. She did say something about stages which make me think it's mast cell. Which I've coursed googled and is scaring the hell out of me.<br /><br />So yes, Nim is scheduled for her surgery next Monday which seems forever from now. I haven't left her side for more than a few minutes since. And now every time I think about it, I fall apart and cry. Because she's my little girl, my best friend, &nbsp;my everything. I can't imagine my life without her.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I'm going to be a basket case for the next week or two at least. At the moment I can't handle talking about it. It took a lot to just write this down. So please be kind.<br /><br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","Hello, thanks for writing for me! Don't stress about writing a story for me, I'm pretty easy to please. I'm sure I'll be happy with whatever you write!<br /><br /><b>Things I like:</b> flirting, humor, snarkiness, first time, relationship fic, ust, bdsm, smut, friendship leading to romance, missing scenes, fix-it stories.<br /><br /><strong>Things I don't like:</strong> torture, character death, unhappy endings, OOC<br /><br /><b>Sherlock: Irene/Sherlock/John</b><br />Sherlock is my fandom. I love Johnlock but I also love Irene. However, I don't see this threesomes as something that would last but more as one time thing or an exploration of John &amp; Sherlock's kinkier side.<br /><br /><strong>CSI: Grissom/Lady Heather<br /></strong>There's something about this pairing that even after all this time makes my heart soar. So anything with them would be great from any time in their friendship/relationships (any episode) to domesticity to exploring their kinkier side.<br /><br /><b>Lost Girl: Dyson/Kenzi</b><br />Who doesn't love Kenzi? She is the best friend a girl or guy (Hale!) could have. And the way Kenzi and Dyson interact with each other....It's just joy. Give me some werewolf tropes, or Russion lore. Just give me some Dyson/Kenzi love!<br /><br /><strong>Outlander: Claire/Jamie&nbsp;<br /></strong>I love Scotland, time travel, ridiculous historical fiction. &nbsp;Outlander has that in spades. &nbsp;And then there is Claire &amp; Jamie. I love their star-crossed romance. I found this fandom through Starz and have yet to read the books but I'm planning on it. So please no spoilers.<br /><br /><strong>Forever: Henry/Iona</strong><br />I was thrilled when Forever introduced Iona and I hope that they come back to her character like CSI did with Lady Heather. So I would love to see what happened after the Ecstasy &nbsp;of the Agony.<br /><br /><strong>Crossovership: Constantine/Dresden</strong><br />When I saw this pairing listed in the Crossover Ships, it totally intrigued me. I'm not sure how these two would meet but I'm sure it would be explosive and possibly hysterically funny. Go wild!&nbsp;<br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","Yup, still alive. I've been lurking on tumblr mostly. But recently I've been feeling very Fannish. So Fannish that I feel the need to interact... And it still feels weird interact on tumblr that isn't reposting or sharing pics.. So I've been looking for ways to interact with fandom again.

I even went so far to look into going to Escapade. Unfortunately, I also saw that Sam Roberts was playing in Montreal at the same time. And well  I haven't been to Montreal in quite sometime. Canada is one of my favorite places and I've missed visiting for a weekend or more. I can't complain though, the reason I haven't been to Canada in a while is because I went to Scotland last spring and London in October for my birthday. 

So I been busy traveling. I also got promoted at work which will eventually lead to more money and has already led to less hours. I just wish I wasn't doing my old job and my new job at the same time. But of course it takes forever to fill a state job.

I've also been slowly updating my house with a new deck and home automation. Home automation really intrigues the geek in me. Next up is a new front porch and redoing my living room setup. To help out with that I've been purging my DVDs. Actually I'm purging many things to make my life simpler. Or maybe I've just realized I don't need so much stuff.

Anyways I feel very Fannish which seems odd since I'm mainly still focused on Sherlock.  Though I can't wait for more MCU movie and House of Cards.

I want to get more active in fandom. If anyone has any recs for kink memes, prompt communities, or other things that would be great. 

Also, where can I see the Eichmann Show?"

Yay Yuletide! This is one of my favorite fannish times of year and I'm just thrilled you will be writing for me. So don't stress about writing a story for me, I'm pretty easy to please. I'm sure I'll be happy with whatever you write!

Things I like: flirting, humor, snarkiness, first time, relationship fic, ust, bdsm, smut, friendship leading to romance, missing scenes, fix-it stories.

Things I don't like: torture, character death, unhappy endings, mpreg in non-sci/fantasy setting, OOC

Revenge: Emily Thorne, Nolan Ross
<I>I'm a total Emily/Nolan shipper. I would love something either in the past or the future...</I>
I love Nolan so much. He makes the show for me. I love how he drops everything for Emily and isn't afraid to call her out when he thinks she is going to far. Their relationship is just so magnetic and fun. Feel free to explore their relationship as either friends or lovers (or both).


Revolution: Charlie Matheson, Miles Matheson
<I>I want to see this relationship in more detail...and if you want to go to a sexual place, I'd be thrilled.</I>
I'm a sick, sick girl and for some reason these two have taken my interest in a way that I didn't quite expect when I started watching this show. I don't even know if I can explain it but I just need to see this relationship play out that way.


Lost Girl: Kenzi, Dyson
<I>I love these two together...as friends or something more.</I>
Who doesn't love Kenzi? She is the best friend a girl or guy (Hale!) could have. And the way Kenzi and Dyson interact with each other....It's just joy. Give me some werewolf tropes, or Russion lore. Just give me some Dyson/Kenzi love!


Millennium Trilogy: Lisbeth Salander, Mikael Blomkvist
<I>I really, really wanted these two to end up together at the end of the series..</I>
All the while I was reading these books, I kept hoping that Mikhail and Lisabeth would end up together. Maybe I was overly influenced by the Daniel Craig movie...But I really want a fix-it."

Sorry this is so late, every time I sat down to write this I stop in the middle and when I pick back up it would be missing because Firefox crashed or some other mishap. Anyways, it's here now and I hope this helps or at least doesn't hinder. Because I'm sure I'll like anything that is written in these four fandoms. 
 
Things I like: flirting, humor, snarkiness, first time, relationship fic, ust, bdsm, smut, friendship leading to romance, missing scenes, fix it stories.

Things I don't like: character death, unhappy endings, mpreg in non-sci/fantasy setting
 
<b>Lost Girl: Kenzi, Dyson</b>
<i>I'd like to see more of Kenzi and Dyson's friendship. If you would like to take it a romantic level that would make me even happier.</i>
I admit it Kenzi and Dyson (and Trick) are my favorite characters and somewhere along the line I got in my head that I wanted them together... And I guess the rest you say is history. Please note I do like Bo, so feel free to use her if you like just no Lauren. 

<b>Raising Hope: Jimmy, Sabrina</b>
<i>What if Drakkar Noir hadn't run out of Howdy's Market so fast and Sabrina had met him at the end of Don't Vote for this Episode. Or what happens when Sabrina finds out that Jimmy is Drakkar Noir?</i>
Raising Hope was the first comedy I've watched in over 5 years. Yes, really. I kept seeing the first few minutes after Glee because my Tivo would tape them and it would make wonder if it was really as good as those few minutes. I then mainlined it over the summer in a weekend. Anyways... I'm totally intrigued with the past that they showed in the last episode of the first season. Drakkar and Jimmy seem so totally different but also the same and I would love to see more of that. Plus the whole Sabrina thing just made it even more delicious. 

<b>Grimm: Nick, Eddie</b>
<i>Would like to see more of Nick and Eddie's friendship. If it develops in to more, I'll be even happier.</i>
I love how Nick just shows up at Eddie's door expecting him to help...and after a bit of griping he always does. For some reason these two just make me awfully happy.

<b>Revenge: Amanda aka Emily, Jack, Nolan, Emily aka Amanda</b>
<i>I admit it I would love to see some weird messy quadrangle going on here. And yes, I would love it if you use Nolan's bisexuality.</i>
Okay, so this where you see into my head and see just how screw it is....I love Nolan a lot. I wouldn't mind seeing him paired with Amanda or Jack or both. But back to my prompt, it's obvious that the show is going in the Jack/Emily direction and it's clear that their is UST between Amanda/Jack. IMHO, Nolan seems to have chemistry with everyone but especially Amanda & Jack. My only request is if possible please get Nolan laid by someone he cares about."

This is prolly my favorite fannish time of the year and I hope it is yours too. So don't stress about writing a story for me, I'm pretty easy to please. I'm sure I'll be thrilled with whatever you write!

<i>Dresden Files
Harry/Thomas
Set somewhere before before the end of Turn Coat.</i>
I'd love a Harry/Thomas slash fic set before the end of Turn Coat. Maybe something to do with the beauty parlor or the first time Thomas feeds off of Harry.

<i>Nikita
Amanda
Would dearly love a story focused on Amanda. How did she become part of Division. Why is she so ruthless, etc.</i>
I'm weirdly focused on Amanda than any other character, but feel free to bring in the other characters to tell your story. (It might be that I've lusted after Melinda Clarke since her time on DOOL.)

<i>Enter the Haggis
Brian/Trevor
Sometimes boys will be boys and things get out of hand. Especially when you've had a bit too much to drink.</i>
If this could take place at a Celtic festival in upstate NY... Just kidding. Set it where ever or whenever just get the boys together.

<i>Pundit RPF
Kent Jones, Rachel Maddow
I would love to read something about their friendship with backstage antics. Bonus points if you include Chris Hayes from the Nation.</i>
I miss Rachel and Kent's onscreen chemistry. So I need some fic love. The two of them together must be a riot. In addition, I love Chris Hayes, if there is a way to work him in to the story great but only if he fits.

"event","As some of you know, each year I'm part of the committee at work that helps raise money to make the holidays better people in need. Over the past couple of days, I've realized that I'm really kind of lucky and that I have it kind of good. Amazingly good to compared to others.  

Usually, we adopt two children from a local center that can't be put in foster care and a veteran and his family. The vet and his family have some basic everyday items on it which just saddens me. (The wife asks for personal hygenie items and one of the boys asks for a haircut.) But what is really killing me is that we're adopting one of out own. A coworker's cancer is back and the doctor has given him 4-6 weeks. He has a boy that is 10 (I believe). So we're going all out this year to raise money this year. 

But still I don't feel like I'm doing enough. So over the next 6 weeks, I'm going to share with you some charities I've given to recently or have given to that day. I'm definitely going to post one every Friday but there may be more.  

The first one is <a href=""https://donate.bulembu.org/?action=view_catalog&Join_ID=287067"">Bulembu International</a> which I heard about from John Mann (the lead singer of Spirit of the West one of my favorite bands). He recently sent an email about Bulembu's work.

<lj-cut text=""Info about Bulembu International from John Mann of Spirit of the West""> 
From John Mann of Spirit of the West

On August 21st of 2010 I flew to Africa. I had been contacted by a member of Bulembu International, an organization responsible for turning an abandoned mining town in Bulembu, Swaziland into a vibrant home for abandoned children. In doing so it helped to create a wonderful community. The town was purchased by a group of entrepreneurial philanthropists in 2006 and from that point on Bulembu has never stopped its efforts to revitalize and transform this beautiful place.

I was asked to come to Bulembu to see the town, to witness the work that was being done and to meet the children and the people involved in its transformation. I believe that the hope was that I would be moved to use my musical connections to create an awareness of Bulembu by encouraging other musicians to be brought on board to help raise awareness and funds.

I really had no idea what to expect. I knew that Swaziland was in a desperate state due to having the highest HIV/Aids rate in the world. What I didn't know was how I would be affected by meeting the orphaned children.

Many of them had been abused, sexually and physically, some by their own relatives. Some of the kids are HIV/AIDS positive. The truly remarkable thing about them is that they have a huge capacity for laughter and fun. Their love of music and dance is unbelievable. I think I laughed longer and harder in this small town then I ever have in my sheltered home in Vancouver. They know they are fortunate. I think we often forget our good fortune.

I had a conversation with a couple of the Bulembu staff. I asked them what was needed the most. They responded by saying, &ldquo;we need books&rdquo;. Upon my return I told this to my wife Jill. Jill works in my favourite book store, Kidsbooks, in Kitsilano, Vancouver. She spoke with the owners Phyllis Simon and Kelly Mckinnon. They immediately jumped on board to offer their experience and enthusiasm to help send Bulembu a library of brand new books.

I am asking you for your help. Spirit of the West has donated money for the library but we are shy of our goal.

We have a container booked to leave in December and we want to make the dream of a Bulembu Library for the kids and the families of this town a reality.

Please help us by going to the Bulembu website where you can get more information about Bulembu. Below you will find the link that will allow you to purchase books for the community of Bulembu. The Kidsbooks book sellers have been selecting books based on information given to them by the Bulembu Staff. This is important as it is easy to make a cultural mistake by selecting a culturally inappropriate book choice. For example in a meeting with two of the Bulembu staff in September at Kidsbooks, one of the staff members pointed at a book with an owl on the cover. He said that in Swaziland, owls are considered to be a very bad omen and that a child would be extremely frightened by the image.

The children of Bulembu are being well cared for. They are well fed and clothed. What we need from you is your help in giving them an opportunity to have access to a wide variety of books. If you love reading this is truly a no brainer. A $20.00 donation will buy a book for the library.

Thanks for your help.
John Mann.

"event","The one show I'm fannish about is going to break my heart in a few short days. Not because they're going off the air which will hurt but because of big freaking spoiler that everyone knows and a lot of us are in denial about. 

So I'm trying to wean myself away from Luke\Reid fandom if only to save myself some heartache. Part of me think it's a good idea. Another thinks I should just get lost in it for awhile until it stops hurting. 

Uhm, yes, I'm talking about As the World Turns. I started watching for Luke/Noah, got totally bored with them, fell for Katie/Brad, and now I'm rooting for Babs/Henry and Luke/Reid.

So yeah, still don't know what to do. And while I really like a lot of other shows like Lie to Me, Memphis Blues, Royal Pains, Rizolli & Isles. I have no desire to search out fic for them. I wouldn't mind seeing Jill/Divya or Jane/Maura but I haven't reached that stage of needing to see it."

Song for a Girl

This lightning's fine
She picks up these tired parts of mine
Who's carrying you tonight?
She carries me all of mine

Up again, down again, out of your head
When she's beside you you're nearly not so dead
Up again, down again, out of your head
When she's beside you you're always at your best

This lightning's fine
She picks up these tired parts of mine
Who's carrying you tonight?
Every now and then baby
Ain't it good to be alive?

Up again, down again, out of your head
When she's beside you you're nearly not so dead
Up again, down again, out of your head
When she's beside you you're always at your best

So a song for the girl"

THROUGH & THROUGH & THROUGH

I'm the Berlin Wall, I'm a communist
You're a wrecking ball in a summer dress
You're the horizon line, I'm the last sunset
I might be going down but I'm not set yet
I'm as white as a ghost, digging foolish gold
I will man my post but I won't do as I'm told
I've got a purple heart from a bloody war
I can't take it anymore, more, more
They say that good things come to those who wait
But if you snooze then you lose
So don't hesitate

Outta sight, outta mind, outta luck, outta wine
Don't you say that I'm out of my fucking mind
I've been talking trash but it ain't my fault
Every time I move somebody's in my spot

You've got nowhere to go
I know, I know, I know
It's only you and me
But good things come in three

You be April Stevens, I'll be April Wine
You be Israel, I will be Palestine
Come on Teach Me Tiger, come on and show me tricks
Let me take my time and take a couple lazy licks

Are you feeling blue?
Through & through & through
Where we find you now?
Around, around, around

All the dirty blondes, playing blue-eyed soul
You won't hear our songs on your radio
Every note we sing can't be solid gold
Every boy can't be Romeo

They say that good things come
To those who wait
Good things come
If you take the bait
In a rummage sale
At the Sally Ann!
Everything is cheap
Love should last a life
Or at least a year!
But it lasts a week
I'm the Berlin Wall
And that ain't all!
I'm a total mess
You're a wrecking ball
I'm a wrecking ball!
In a summer dress"

"event","Please forgive me for this being so, so late... But here are my thoughts on what I wouldn't mind in my threesome story if you so desire.

NCIS: Tony DiNozzo/Leroy Gibbs/Abigail Scutio 
NCIS: Tony DiNozzo/Tim McGee/Abigail Scutio 
Leverage: Eliot Spencer/Parker/Alec Hardison 

For the most part for three above, what I really, really want is a happy polyamorous relationship where everyone are equals. Domesticity, Porn, Fun. I guess just write what makes you happy and I'm sure it will make me happy. 

NCIS: LA :   G. Callen/Sam Hanna/Kensi Blye 

NCIS: LA is a little trickier. I'm looking for more of a first time situation but I'm not sure that they make it out as a happy threesome. I'll admit I have some bias for G/Sam.

Anyways, go forth and have fun! And thanks!"

"event","Yes, I know this is pathetically late. (Not as late as the Three Ships one, which I promise to do next once I find/remember what I requested.) But here are my thoughts, likes, and dislikes. As you know the optional details are optional.

<i>RPF - Enter the Haggis : Any</i>
<i>Wacky band hijinks and the infamous Facebook war. Extra special bonus points Brian/Trevor.</i>
I'll admit this is probably my fandom at the moment. I'm reading their facebooks, streaming their shows, and seeing them as much as possible.... So, yeah. Brian/Trevor... The two of them just love to fool around and crack jokes and it just leads to endless possibilities. 

<i>NCIS Los Angeles : G. Callen</i>
<i>Litte lost boy turns into superagent. Or Callen/DiNozzo. Why was he shuffled in and out of 37 foster homes?</i>
Callen just fascinates me. He is the totally the reason I tune in every week. I would love any fic totally focusing on him in the above situations or something of your choosing. 

<i>Dollhouse : Alpha/Echo aka Caroline</i>
<i>Was Echo Alpha's Omega?</i>
If Echo was Alpha's Omega, what unhinged him? (Well, what unhinged him more?) Or show a ""happier time"" between Echo and Alpha.

<i>White Collar (tv) : Neal Caffrey/Peter Burke</i>
<i>Neal/Peter. They are obsessed with each other sometimes that's good, sometimes that's bad. Or Neal finally gets Peter to buy a better suit.</i>
Really, anything Neal/Peter will be great. These two just totally spark off each other.   

As for my likes and dislikes...
I like...
stories rated PG to NC17.
humour, angst, happy endings, porn, plot, porn with plot, alternative universes, crossovers

I dislike...
torture, unhappy endings, OOC, melodrama, death"

1. Pick 20 of your favorite movies.
2. Go to IMDB.com and find a quote from each movie.
3. Post them in a note for everyone to guess.
4. Bold when someone guesses correctly, and put who guessed it and the movie.
5. NO GOOGLING/using IMDB search functions.

<lj-cut text=""Guess the movies!!"">

1. <strike>So Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together and have bloody adventures. And the great whore will suckle us until we are fat and happy and can suckle no more. And then, when enough men have died, perhaps you will have your freedom.</strike> <b>Gladiator</b> guessed by <lj user=""lafemmedarla"">

2. <strike>I don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought, or processed, or repair anything sold, bought, or processed. You know, as a career, I don't want to do that.</strike> <b>Say Anything</b>  guessed by <lj user=""imoldfashioned"">

3. <strike>Are you trying to tell me you speak fag? </strike> <b>Bring it On</b> guessed by <lj user=""lafemmedarla"">

4. <strike>Any thug can kill. I need you to take your ego out of the equation. </strike> <b>Casino Royale</b> guessed by <lj user=""jarlsberg71"">

5. <strike>Dear book, this is another day in my life. A life is like a book. A book is like a box. A box has six sides. Inside and outside, so, how do you get to what's inside? How do you get what's inside, out? Once upon a time, there lived a very pretty girl, who lived in a beautiful box, and everybody loved her.</strike> <b>Gia</b> guessed by <lj user=""sandersyager"">

6. <strike> What's a Nubian?</strike> <b>Chasing Amy</b> guessed by <lj user=""coreopsis"">

7. Ever since I can remember, I've wanted to be clever. Some people are born clever, same way some people are born beautiful. I'm not one of those people.

8. <strike> Yarp. </strike> <b>Hot Fuzz</b> guessed by <lj user=""jarlsberg71"">

9. <strike> Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.</strike> <b>Beetle Juice</b>  guessed by <lj user=""always_bryn"">


10. <strike>Sex is kinda like pizza. When it's bad, it's still pretty good.</strike> <b>Threesome</b> guessed by <lj user=""sandersyager""> and <lj user=""benkenobigal""> 

11. I don't want you buying me anything. I don't want you buying me, period! 

12. <strike> Mother, just because I wear trakkies and play sport does not make me a lesbian.</strike> <b>Bend it like Beckham</b> guessed by <lj user=""jarlsberg71"">

13. <strike> Hello. What? No I don't work today, I'm playing hockey at two.</strike> <b>Clerks</b> guessed by <lj user=""coreopsis"">

14. <strike>They all have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs, and, you know, they've all made themselves a part of something and they can talk about what they do. What am I gonna say? ""I killed the president of Paraguay with a fork. How've you been?"" </strike> <b>Grosse Point Blank</b> guessed by <lj user=""coreopsis""> 

15. <strike>That's all right. Anyway, my mum always said things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. </strike> <b>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</b> guessed by <lj user=""minttown"">

16. For me, stealing's always been a lot like sex. Two people who want the same thing: they get in a room, they talk about it. They start to plan. It's kind of like flirting. It's kind of like... foreplay, 'cause the more they talk about it, the wetter they get. The only difference is, I can fuck someone I've just met. But to steal? I need to know someone like I know myself.

17. <strike>Don't mess with the bull, young man. You'll get the horns. </strike> <b>The Breakfast Club</b> guessed by <lj user=""kshandra"">

18. <strike> When was the last time you remember turning on the radio and listening to popular music? Or, just give me a decade. The 70's? I'm guessing - was, was Michael Jackson still black? Pearl Jam - I'll go back ten years with you. Ten years - 20 years, The Cure? Nothing? </strike> <b>Die Hard 4</b> guessed by <lj user=""jarlsberg71"">

19. Yes. I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes. 

20. <strike>First of all, I'd like to thank all of you who've flown in from the States. I'm really touched. As for the rest of you, I'd have thought that lots of frightful Americans flying in was an excuse for staying away, so I thank you, too.</strike> <b>Four Weddings and a Funeral</b> guessed by <lj user=""always_bryn""> and <lj user=""the_star_fish"">"

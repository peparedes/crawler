"event","Bon Jour, my dearest companion, the pages on which I write my thoughts and that which my heart desires.  It hadst been too long since I have shared my feelings with you.  I, Marguerite De Mauleon, Comtesse de Rhedae; am looking forward to celebrating my 33 year this spring.  It is a wonder to have lived, to be able to have been married, to watch my children begin to grow, to see my daughter Josephine begin to bloom into adulthood; and to have the pleasure of being able to travel around the French Countryside.  It amazes me that some of my dearest friends and family still remember and call me by my fond childhood name of ""Brie""; and I do so prefer to answer to that rather than the stuffy Marguerite.  For, as much as I have been raised to be a lady; my dear older brother, Pierre, for whom my son is named, was a large, albeit secret, part of my upbringing as well.  

Anon, for now.  I must away, the head housekeeper has a question about the linens."

"event","Sad that it is that our yearly pilgrimage to Lyon is over; it was an eventual trip.  For myself, I have purchased yardage of silk, that my attendant, Marie, and I can form into lovely gowns for next year when the king visits.  I do love the shops in Lyon, and am grateful for the funds that My Lord generously allows me to spend.  I did return home to find that things in the chateau were not as I left them, it seems that my Lord has become enamored with one of the serving girls, and she is expecting his bastard.  For my Lord's sake, I do hope that this child is another son.  He worries, for Pierre's health is not as we had hoped it would be.  After watching my newly married cousin and sister; both being more familiar with a pirate and a Germam respectively than I would have hoped; I believe that mayhaps I am not cut out to be the solid support that my cousin, Jean, would have wanted me to be with the girls.  In actuality, I envy their youth, and the excitement of the affection that they found, and therefore could not disapprove nearly as much as I should.  Especially knowing that they are the second and third wives of the Marquis's, both of whom are getting old, and simply need heirs from a noble family.  They should enjoy their youth, as I should have enjoyed mine - although I do so love my children.  However, if Georges' infidelity continues, it gets me less motivation to remain the same loyal wife I have been in the past.  Maybe I can yet find some of the fun my sister and cousin share - not that I would behave completely improperly for a lady, but a wee bit would not hurt.  I think when I visit the shire of Bristol, I might go in a bit of a disguise; and see what fun the lower classes live.  

The children are still to remain in the chateau, and I believe that arrangements are to be made to send them all to boarding school.  Georges is done with my being a mother, wants to see them raised right.  I hate the critisism on how I am raising my children; but since I attended school in Rome, I can see him wanting the same for them.  

I must be off, there are chores to be tended to before bed."

"event","It is a lovely spring afternoon here in Rennes, although things in the chateau are not as lovely as they are in the gardens.  In the last week, my attendant, Alita, has been dismissed.  She opted to neglect her duties, instead spending time walking with a gentleman that her father does not wish to be her suitor; so she has been sent back to her father's house.  I discovered her myself, one evening after the children were asleep; and I went out to watch the moonlight shine on the gardens whilst my lord was visiting with a neighboring nobleman.  
I do find that I am quite fond of her replacement, Marie.  Marie is the daughter of a Viscomte who wanted her to gain experience in the courts before finding her a husband.  She will be traveling with me to Lyon to visit my cousins later this spring.  
I have concerns about my lord allowing the children to travel to Lyon with me as well.  It is to be a priveledge for them to travel; especially the younger ones, however they have been in-attentive to their nanny.  My lord, Georges, is also considering sending the eldest to the school in Rome where myself, my sister, and our dear cousin Genevieve were educated.  He will be making his decision in the coming weeks.  
I do so look forward to spending some time with my family again.  I know the roads are sometimes treacherous, and it is the rainy season; but I do miss my sister and my cousins.  Gabriella will be leaving her home within a fortnight to travel here, to make the trip the rest of the way with me.  I am uncertain who our father will send with her; however with her most recent engagement to the Marque, this is an important experience to her  Just to think, both Gabriella and Genevieve engaged to Marques, and within weeks of each other.  The fall will make a lovely time for the weddings."

"event","My hudband, Georges; has just informed me that 3 of my 4 children will be accompanying Gabrielle and I to Lyon for the Spring festival; providing that they have not lost this privledge by the time we leave to travel.  My eldest daughter, Josephine needs the practice in traveling, so that she has a better opportunity to make a fine match in a few years.  I think that the exposure to the ladies of Catherine DeMedici's court will be good for her, to allow her to observe the more proper behavior seen in Paris, rather than the slightly lax formality here in the countryside.  She is 13, and so soon her father will be looking for a match.  As the eldest child, I expect her father to provide her with a fine dowry; and I do hope that she marries up in the nobility.  My other 2 daughters, Carlotta, who is 9 years of age, and Noella, who is 5; will also be accompanying us, as will their governess.  I am hesitant to take the younger children on such an ardourous journey; although I know it is better for them, and for me as well; for I would miss them, since we are planning to be away for at least 3 months.  I do with that Pierre could go along as well; his father is insisting that he stay at home, continue with his lessons, and begin learning the household accounts; should anything happen to my lord Georges, then Pierre would be able to step in.  
My husband is only allowing me to take along one attendant, in addition to the children's governess.  I do hope that this will be sufficient.  I am choosing Alita, for her skill with a needle, as well as for her company.  With the silk and cloth merchants in Lyon, I want to take the opportunity to spend a bit more of my husband's wealth, and better attire by daughters, myself; and of course, something for my husband and son."

"event","This day, I was able to visit with my younger cousin, Genevieve; and remind her that my sister, Gabrielle and I would be visiting the spring festival in Lyon with her uncle; my dear cousin, Jean, and her.  She was pleased with the news that my sister would be along, and I reminded her that my sister was there to assist her from getting into the problems that have happened in the past.  If Genevieve continues her flirtatious behavior, I am concerned that her father will not make her the marriage that would benefit her station, and her way of life.  Her father has pampered her way beyond what a daughter should be, giving her a good education and then allowing her to travel to visit Jean without a chaperone along the way, other than the family servants and Jean's men at arms.  
It was good to see her, and also to see a couple of the family retainers that have been working in other estates the last few months.  They will be traveling with us to Lyon, and with the comments that Genevieve was making about Gabrielle; I will be glad to have the additional hands in supervising the young ladies; and reminding them of ""Proper"" behavior.  
I must away for now . . . anon"

"event","Bon Jour, I am Marguerite D'Mauleon, the Comtessa de Rhedae.  I was born in Narbonne, France; and am married to the Comte de Rhedae; Georges D'Hautpoul.  I am currently preparing for a visit to Lyon with my cousin, Jean Reneau, the Comte de Frasne; who is the King's justice.  The King, of course, Henri II and his lovely wife, Catherine D'Medici, will be visiting Lyon as usual for the spring festival, and will be meeting the bankers to discuss the terms of their outstanding loans.  It is so sad that the King has let his affairs come to such a state; I am glad that my husband has wisely invested his monies.  My dear younger sister, Gabrielle, will be traveling with me to Lyon.  Our dear father wants her to have a bit more experience with the world before her marriage, I believe he has finally settled on a suitor for her, and about time, I would say.  However, being that I do love my dear sister, I do want father to make her a good match.  It will be good of her to get the experience to travel, but it concerns me that part of the reason we will be visiting Lyon with our cousin is to assist in watching over his neice, Genevieve.  The young lady is such a troublemaker, nothing like my dear little sister; I only hope that she does not influence Gabrielle in a negative way.  I also do hope that my Lord can manage the servants whilst we are away, they are not used to responding to him, and he does tend to have a heavier hand than I.  Ah, but I have only a matter of months to prepare myself for this journey, and since we shall be seeing the King; I must prepare myself new rainment.  I am off, to see if the cook has the evening meal prepared; my Lord should be returning and hungry any moment now."

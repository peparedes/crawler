"event","So the weekend is over and I still haven't made time to watch Phonebooth. I'm totally excited, though.  Our first tennis match is Tuesday against Currituck.  Its gonna be great fun playing new people and stuff.  I can't wait.  I went out and bought a headband and wristbands to make sure those beach bums know that we from da HC, and we keepin' it gangsta.  But the next match is Thursday, home, vs. Northeastern.  Duke lost to Carolina today in a very good game, but at least they threw up a shot at the end of the game, two actually.  I didn't get to do ANYTHING this weekend but work, so I plan on making this week my weekend and have a good ol' time.  Let's go DUKE. Win these last 9 games to win the ACC and NCAA tourney."

"event","Jeez Louise, not the best afternoon for gambling.  I lost 6 to burden and 15 to Kenny, he beat my tail at tunk.  I can't play with him at the skillet, it is his shrine of good luck.  But i must say I've indulged in my own form of good luck, not necessarily with cards, but with life.  Things are going very easily.  Very little homework if any, classes are easy. Plus, things are looking very promising in the lady department.  I'm feelin very lucky in that respect.  I'm going to Raleigh this weekend and I'm totally looking forward to it.  It should be very fun.  I'm looking forward to going to the club ;-) There's a first time for everything. Plus, I'm off all day Sunday so I have that whole afternoon to do whatever with whoever.  It should be interesting to see who gets selected ;-)  But things are lookin up, all the way around."

First things first, DUKE BEAT CAROLINA, WHEW!!! WHERE YALL CAROLINA FANS AT NOW BABY, WHO'S #1 IN THE ACC NOW?  WHEW!!  But I have recently asked off work for the last weekend of the month and am going to Raleigh to see my brother, Shields, and the boys, and spend a little along time with ashley ;-), just kidding shields.  I'm kinda excited, it should be a fun trip.  Ummm, I have to work Friday night, but might be able to go to the game afterwards if i can get off a little early.  Saturday morning I have a scholarship interview for the Woman's Club in Edenton and work later that afternoon.  Sunday, however, I have church in the morning, but me and burden are goin to a show in Gates County to see Elizabeth.  I'm lookin' forward to seein her and her performance.  Since I don't have youth at night I can do soemthing with her after the show.  It should be fun.  I'm ready.  I'm kinda ready for Beta convention and Prom too, yet not at the expense of the moment.  I'm having a great time right now.  However, I do get kinda ill when my gambling is going down the drain.  But overall, things are lookin up.  It will be interesting to see what goes down over the next few weeks.  I'm all smiles and I hope things will work out for me."

Burden killed me in tunk this morning, kenny beat me in a race of a basketball game, and burton and me couldn't beat burden and andy to save our life.  Not a good day for the wallet, but i guess you have to lose some to win some.  Things are very interesting in the prom department though.  Its a free for all, haha.

"event","Well, i reckon its about time i update this thing.  Today is Thursday, Sarah got back in town last night, so I am more than happy.  School was cancelled today and its snowing now so i think it is pretty safe to assume that it will be cancelled tomorrow.  ummm, random thoughts, my mom wants me to cut my hair bad, but i like it. should it stay or should it go? any ideas?  Mr. Cox isn't bad at all, so far we've just listened to him lecture all period long about stuff that is actually pretty interesting.  I don't really see why everyone complains so much.  Perhaps I am reeping the benefits of a good class, since there are only three of us in there.  But anyways, today me, burden, burton, and west went to los amigos, when all of a sudden i felt like i was in a movie.  A mysteriously beautiful silhouette walks through the door with the sun bright behind her, casting a shadow on her whole body until she is close enough that i realize it is the one who i had not seen in soooooooo long.  There she was, unannounced, sarah.  Kinda crazy that she would come at such a random time and place, I dont know how she knew where we were, but anyways, we all went back to the house and lyndsay, andy, and emily all came over and we hung out.  I baked cookies and we went to burtons to play ping pong.  I thought today went very well and hopefully tomorrow will result in a similar outcome.  However, Burden beat my tail in Tunk today, which made me mad.  I watched Tilt and the Apprentice tonight, both very fulfilling.  I want to have something to do tomorrow, a plan.  I hate not having something for everyone to do.  I just want everyone to have a good time.  Maybe I'll ride the 4wheeler tomorrow and cut up a little bit.  Most importantly, I hope I can do something really fulfilling like save a soul or something.  You ever feel guilty that God gives you so much and  you give back so little.  I have several friends around me that need to be shown the way of God, but I have been to lazy to do it.  It really makes no sense at all.  I play cards an hour a day but I rarely carry on conversations of such religious backgrounds.  So tomorrow I'll try to make it my goal to talk to someone about Christ.  It is a hard thing to do, but if you think of it as, ""I may be saving someone's life for eternity"", it becomes more essential.  It is my duty as a Christian to enlighten others and encourage them to explore their spirituality.  I think it is kinda like Mary Kay, you are supposed to recruit more people as you go along.  But i think that this may be a little more important."

I wanna know if classes at the tech will transfer to Duke and nobody knows and nobody takes the initiative to find out.  Now it looks like I will be stuck at HCHS with Cox and not have any college credit under my belt just because people are lazy.  Why oh why.  But anyways, I feel like since school has started back, I am right back where I left off from last year, with a thousand essays to write for a hundred scholarships.  Not to mention the homework that I already have.  But anyways, outside of school, Sarah is gone for 2 weeks while shes on vacation.  Kinda crazy not seeing her for so long after I had been seeing her a lot over Christmas break.  Oh well, I guess it will be like this  a lot with her at school.  Kinda sucks though.  But anyways, I kinda like my classes.  It will be interesting to see how Cox's class works out.  Well, I'm gonna go.  I'd hate to take up too much time from my busy, confusing schedule."

"event","Well, many of you may have heard, but if you're not quite cool enough, here it is, its official, me and sarah are together.  I have mixed emotions about it.  I am rather relieved to have the whole 'asking part' behind me, yet at the same time, it seems like the fun part of a relationship is getting to that particular point and now, that part is over.  But regardless, I remain optimistic that a bright future is ahead for us.  I sure hope so.  I like her a lot, she makes me feel real lucky, even when Burden has taken all my money while gambling.  I just hope that the future will be as great as the past has been, although I am definitely not going to overlook the present.  But all in all, I am happy and look forward to pursuing this relationship.  Good stuff.  Andy and I talked about it last night, and i did so too with shields - there is no way to ask a girl out without making it sound like you're in 7th grade.  It's all so juvenile.  Aahh.  It really crushed my manhood for a moment but I guess its all over now so I will try to forget it, but I'm like an elephant, I never forget.  
Today at work was busy, but two bright spots lifted my day, I say Tim ""I am slow yo"" Cherry for the first time in at least a year.  He is on old coworker of mine, matter of fact my mentor.  He has a tattoo that says I Am Slow Yo.  That says it all. Then Shields and the gang finally came in to eat lunch so i went on break to eat with them too.  It was Shields, David, Coast, AC, and Grayson.  It was my first time meeting Grayson, but he reminded me a LOT of myself.  A couple times he said exactly what I was about to say, right before I said it.  Pretty cool to hang out with all of em I guess.  Makes me look forward to going to Duke next fall, so I'll get to see them more plus make some new friends on campus.  I might eat dinner with them tonight at Catherine's.  Austin, my cousin who recently moved to Kentucky, is back here for the holidays, so he may come over and spend the night tonight.  It will be fun to hang out with him for old times sake.  Cody is back in town, so I may do something with him tonight.  Who knows, me being so spontaneous and all.  Seems like there is plenty to do tonight, unlike usual.  I hate not having anything to do, especially when I want to do something with Sarah.  Seems like bout the only thing to do is to go hang out at someones house or watch a movie, both get old very quickly.  I dont have bundles of money to be going out of town with either, and I feel bad for dragging her along on my boring adventures, like last night.  I had a few folks over, and she watched TV as I played cards.  I hate it that thats the way it is, and theres not much better to do in Ahoskie.  Anyone have any other suggestions to occupy time? I'm taking them, feel free to comment."

"event","Through my wild journies I have gained fathoms of wisdom and have contemplated this theory.
   As kids grow up, they are told that there is a mysterious man named Santa Claus who brings Christmas presents on Christmas Eve.  You never see him but you put your trust in that he is there and you believe with all your heart.  Every ounce of faith you have tells you that Santa is real.
   However, there comes that time in life where u discover that Santa is indeed not real and that it is merely just a story made up to fool little kids.  You immediately think how stupid you are to actually believe that he could be real in the first place.  Next, you begin to second-guess everything you accept to be true and are told that seeing is believing, so you only value what you can behold in front of you.  You don't want to take the risk of being embarrassed again that something that you thought could be real actually is fake.
   Similarly, God is like Santa Claus.  You can't see him, but you know he is there. He is not seen but his evidence is all around you.  The story seems far-fetched but you believe because you have no reason not too.  Until you find out that Santa Claus is a sham.  If Santa isn't real, then why should you think God is real.  Why couldn't the whole ""God thing"" be just another story like the Santa story.  No one can prove that hes there anyways right?
The Santa myth is destroying faith amongst American children all the time.  They are scared to put there trust out on the line like that after being scarred the first time.  If you touch a hot iron once and it burns you, human nature tells you not to touch the iron again.  The same thing applies to the faith of a child.  I think that Santa is the main reason that so many young people are skeptical about the idea of believing in an unseen God, when society tells them believe only what you can see.  The Bible tells us to ""have the faith of a child"" so perhaps we can learn a lesson from the younger generations.  Sometimes you have to go out on a limb and put it all on the line.  Thats what faith is all about.  Because ""faith the size of a mustard seed is enough to move a mountain."""

"event","Hmm.. what to talk about, perhaps a short summary of recent happenings.  Christmas is over and I am pretty pleased with all of the occurences.  I've made about 300 dollars, most of which will go to the ski trip.  But there is sooo much snow and I'm happy.  We played football today in the snow and it was cold cause it was still snowing while we were playing, wouldnt have been so bad w/o it actually still snowing.  But I'm not looking forward to working tomorrow because i miss the chance to play some more in the snow while its still thick.  But i'll get over it.  We are gonna rock the HC gym tomorrow night (actually tonight) with the Hertford Honkies, I'm WAY looking forward to it.  IT'll awesome.  As long as i dont put finger paint on my face again... Ugh... But we should have a decent crowd, i just hope the game isnt cancelled.  But life is treating me very well right now.  Today was totally a good day.  I guess it started last night.  I had a real good time while everyone was at the house.  Me and Sarah had a good time, too.. if you know what i mean, jk.  Nah, but things are going very well in that situation.  Things seem very promising.  I'm very satisfied with how things are going.  Some of the boys keep asking me when i'm gonna ask her out but right now I don't see why I should, I kinda like it how it is, and i'm not sure if doing that would change things.  But who knows, I'm liable to slip up and sucker in.  Kinda like i did while deciding to create this live journal, i caved right in.  I think about it sometimes.  Sometimes I say I should, sometimes I say i should'nt, so it will be interesting to see which decision to make.  But the question isn't about if i like her or not, its about how i want to tackle this situation.  I'm certain things will be ok.  As long as she doesn't mind being in my company too much ;-).  Me and the boys (burden and andy) talked about that and everything else last night.  Lately, we have just not talked about these things so it was good to catch up.  To wake up and see the snow this morning was amazing... I couldn't believe it.  So i got to sleep pretty late.  However, I had to go on a long wrecker call by the club LTD, but after an hour and a half we had things figured out and were back in place.  All in all a good day, coulda been better, coulda been worse.  I'd give today an 8, on a scale of 1-10.  Thanks to everyone who made it happen."

Christmas is being prolonged in my family because my aunt, uncle, and cousins can't come back to town until the 26th where we will resume usual Christmas Eve activities.  But yesterday was lackluster for the most part.  We took a trip to Franklin in hopes of finding a golf cart radio for my dad, but turns out that they didnt even have any.  It was very disappointing and I felt like everyone around me was bored in the truck... I tend to pride myself on keeping plenty of conversation going in those type of situations but it just felt kinda awkward :-/ , but anyways when I got home I took a nap then ate and went to the party at Shields' house.  I am not much of a ""mingler"", but I managed.  I eventally grew tired of hearing, ""so I hear you're going to Duke.""  Seems like thats all anyone knows about me.  But anyways, I'll get over it.

"event","Well, enough deep thoughts for today, i'm sitting here bored cause sarah can't get outta the house and i dont feel like doing much else.  Today wasn't bad.  Work was kinda slow-going and I enjoyed that.  When I came home Lyndsay and Richard came over for a minute and we talked.  I enjoyed that. We don't really talk as much as we used to, the holidays are great, they open up so much time.  But then I talked to Sarah for a while and decided to write this thing.  I hate not doing anything.  Tonight was rather largely a let-down but at least i get to catch up on my sports. :-/  But anyways, I'll make it, I'm sure.  
What the heck, lets go ahead and express a deep thought while its on my mind.   I've been thinking a lot about religion lately.  There are a lot of people out there who either don't know God or have grown intolerant to His presence.  I think churches have killed the desire of young people to know God.  Lets face it, for the most part church is boring and I DONT WANT PEOPLE TO THINK GOD IS BORING.  HES NOT.  He has done so much for me and I wish I could share my enthusiasm with everyone.  God is awesome.  Why can't everyone know that?  So many people in my generation do no know God and that eats at my heart.  So many people sleep in on Sunday mornings and not go to church.  Not that going to church is a direct refelction of your relationship with God or anything but daggum *light bulb*.  
I'm tired of hearing the excuse ""you don't have to go to church to be a Christian.""  Bump that man, thats a fib because the ones who say that are the ones who have faded away from Christ.  If you were preparing for a sport like football, would you wait for the season to start without working out, without practicing, with no preparation.  No, of course not.  The same thing goes with Christianity.  Church on Sunday is just like a football workout.  It stretches your spirtiual muscles once a week.  So you really have a choice, you can settle for a horrible season and not work out or you can prepare yourself and be the best you can.  The way I see it, anything that is worth doing, is worth doing to the best of your ability.  So I'm tired of lazy Christians who think that what they are doing is ok.  Now don't get me wrong... I'm not saying I'm perfect or that this sin is any worse than another, but this is a HUGE deal.  Remember, Christianity is all about relationships and if you have a weak one with your heavenly father, then what type of religion is that? It's a dead religion and it is an epidimic sweeping the nation.  I'm tired of it and I don't mean to offend anyone but take this to heart.  This is BIG.  This is life or death, for a long time.  Anyone who ever needs to talk to me about anything, any questions or whatever, feel free to ask.  I don't mean to be a Christianity salesman, I'm just here to offer the truth and I would love to save a life, forever."

"event","Man, I just typed away for like ten minutes only to have my computer screw up and lose my entry but anyways I'm retyping what I remember.  Deep thought number two involves the questions that no one knows the answers to, questions about life.  What is life all about? Well here it is - life is about relationships and decisions.  If you focus on those two things, then everything else will fall into place.  Nothing is more important than the people you interact with.  Some people say they could care less about what others think about them but I say that is bull.  Life is all about relationships and what others think about you is muy importante`.  So I encourage everyone to treasure relationships with others.  They mean the world.  So this brings me to religion and my attempt to evangelize to my few readers- Christianity is, like life, all about relationships, and it involves a relationship with the all-powerful all-knowing everlasting God.  What more could you want.  He gives so much every day that we dont't even think about and we rarely bother to acknowledge it.  He isn't just an imaginary figure that was created long ago and I know that for a FACT.  But hes so great.  He gave His son to die for people like you and me just becuase He knows we screw up so much.  I don't know that I could give up any of my family members for any cause.  Especially someone elses mess-ups... The greatest gift ever. Wow.  Its hard to even fathom some of this stuff but the moral of the story is treasure friends and treasure God's gift.  You owe him tremendously.  Try to live your life in a way that would please Him.  Because THAT is what life is all about.  Life is the sum of your decisions."

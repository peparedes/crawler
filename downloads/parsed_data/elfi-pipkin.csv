"event","I actually got the inspiration for today's post while I was travelling to college on the bus. I think about quite a lot on my bus jouney too and from college everyday, possibly why it's one of the few times I'm considered to be 'quiet' - especially in the mornings it irritates me a little bit if someone I know comes and sits next to me and starts regailing all their problems. I consider my journey in the morning to still be 'me' time, and afterwards I feel bad for not being conversational, one because I find it hard to make conversation when I'm still waking up, and two because I feel I really should have made the effort even if I didn't feel like it. Anyway, this isn't what this post was about.

On Friday night as I sat watching Top Gear of the pops (comic relief) in the lounge, stretched out on the sofa. After about ten minutes however, I felt this 'ticking' sensation, but thought nothing of it - it felt as though it was just the leather of the sofa moving about as it does, so I ignored it. Until it became such that I couldn't. So me being me, I looked behind me, the irrational fear popping into my head of 'what if it's a spider struggling to free itself from where I've crushed it?' alright, laugh, but these sorts of stupid thoughts often pop into my head. 

But no, I discover as I move, that my back feels cold... and very wet. My only reaction to this is to look upwards, only to receive a large, slightly warm drop smack bang between the eyes. Yuck.

So the ceiling is leaking, and I have no idea where it's coming from. Then my brain begins to work and I puzzle it through something like this...

The water was warm
The bathroom and my bedroom are above the lounge
I remember when Blythe left the sink tap running and it dripping through into the lounge

It's the hot water tank.

So, moving the sofa out of the way of the dripping (a mighty task for a small lass like myself) and retrieving the mop bucket from the kitchen to catch the drops, I run upstairs to investigate. Lo and behold I also discover the reason for that 'damp, hot varnished wood' aroma that I had been smelling as I walked to and from the office all evening. I remember experiencing it once before when the roof leaked all those years ago, and it was slightly worrying, but I hadn't thought anything of it until now. Anyway, inspecting the water tank, I saw that the neutraliser had completely filled to the brim with rusty, manky water, and that the towels we store in there to keep them warm were completely soaked. 

By now I was starting to panic. How long had this been going on for? How bad was it? And most importantly How the hell was I supposed to fix it? 

As usual, mum was out, so I tried to get hold of her. This made me merely angry at the time, and apologies to all who were on the receiving end of my panic, because when I look back at it now I didn't react well to the fact that even after ringing her mobile no less than five times, and Craig's house number at least four, I realised I wasn't going to get through. Typical - this is after I had been reassured 'if you ever need me, I'm just a phonecall away'. Which as I discovered, is not true. Alright, fair enough I accept that at Craig's house there might be no mobile signal, but to not answer a house phone on the basis that 'it doesn't ring' is just plain pathetic. So there's me, stuck in this house with what has now grown to a steady stream of water running from a crack in the ceiling, my younger sister and nobody else to help me. 

I figured there wasn't much else I could do but to protect the room from the wrath of the leak, so scouting out some dry towels, I packed them around the bottom of the tank, draped them over the back of the sofa (to stop the drips from splashing onto it) and around on the carpet. And that was about it. My plan sort of worked because after about twenty minutes, the leak slowed to a steady drip again, but by morning mum had come home and as far as I was concerned it was her problem now. 

So Saturday passed uneventfully, she called a 'man' in for sometime this week, while turning the heating up and draining the hot water tank. After a while when the leak stopped, she turned the hot water back on and everything seemed a-ok, or at least I thought it did. 

This morning, I wandered bleary eyed downstairs to be greeted by a strange, sloppy splashing noise. Uttering some sort of expletive I peered cautiously into the lounge to discover that the bucket had overflowed. Ok, bad, but not very much so as I wandered in to empty it. Yuck - as I took one step into the room my socks were instantly soaked, and looking around I could see that half the room was a mess of wet carpet, the back of the sofa had 'splash stains' and that the foot rest had left a nice brown skid where the wood colour had leaked into the lovely cream carpet, which had now become a fetching shade of grey. Emptying the bucket, defeated, I did the usual towels trick and told Blythe to phone mum and tell her what happened. I then promptly caught the bus. 

I think the moral of the story is that you should never neglect anything. It'll hold for so long, but there's only so much anything, or indeed anyone can take. Read what you will into this. 

I also post this in my blogger every time. :)"

"event","Well, it was a hectic weekend anyway, but retrospectively, I did enjoy actually doing something for once even though I was constantly on the move.

Friday night I caught the train(s) down to Malvern to stay with my friend Megan at her dad's house. By the time we got there it was so late we just decided to get chip shop chips and have done (We were really desperate just to eat something!) but they were still tasty. We also stayed up quite late just talking about stuff, the trip down etc, Megan catching up with the news with her dad. For some reason the rest of the family were out of the house, so I didn't get to meet them, but from Megan's advice I gathered this was a good thing; she doesn't get on too well with her step mum and their kids.

Saturday morning we walked their weird little Cavalier thing round a field, and my god, even at 9am it was like a hot July day in Yorkshire. 'Down South' truly is another world, everyone's too civilised, the weather's too nice, the grass is actually green... weird. Then after that we decided to catch another two trains to get to the NEC and go to crufts. 

Crufts in itself was a really good day out. What I didn't like was the congestion, the lack of decent eating facilities (You're also not able to get your own food), and the fact that we never got to see the main events in the arena due to the queue's being too long. You'd have thought that with having tickets you could have had some sort of fast track into the place, but for everything you had to queue, and in most places it was very crowded. The whole place was also very poorly signposted. 

Other than that there was never a shortage of things to do. We got to watch the showing of Miniature short and long haired daschunds, Irish wolfhounds, Salukis, Afghan hounds and Smooth Fox Terrier groups. And we trailed round stalls, watched demonstrations, saw every breed of dog there is... most people were really nice too and let you take pictures of their dogs. So I have quite a lot of good pictures :)"

"event","The results from our January Exams came today, so for most people that included some AS resits aswell as module 4/5 of their A level subjects, for me, I had three resits, one in chemistry in a hope to get 4 extra marks to boost me to an A and two in physics because well... I was hoping to get better than a C at least. And then I also had Biology, Chemistry and Physics exams, aswell as General Studies, which nobody really cares about (:D)

I didn't really want to be involved in the whole 'so what did you get?' because after the huge downer in the summer, I didn't think I could bear to live through it again (yes, I did not have high expectations of myself)

So, for the benefit of everyone here, here are my origional results. 

Biology - A
unit 1 - a
unit 2 - a
unit 3 - a

Chemistry - B
unit 1 - b
unit 2 - a
unit 3 - a

Physics - C
unit 1 - c
unit 2 - c
unit 3 - b

Maths - C (and I dropped this one) 

so you can kinda guess which ones I resat. :) and these are my results I got this time, including the module 4/5 mark

Biology module 5 - A

Chemistry 
module 1 - a
module 4 - b (bit dissapointed with this one, but I think I just missed the A mark AGAIN)

Physics
module 1 - c (gained a whopping.... 2 marks)
module 2 - A (OMG -HOW- DID I MANAGE AN A?!!3)
module 4 - c ( :| I revised so hard for this too. I was 1 mark off a B)

And for General Studies? I got a C. Lol :D

--

So on some respects, I'm really happy, but on others, not so. The A I got in Biology was a truly terrible A aswell, literally only just scraped (considering I got 95/100 etc last year, 79/90 isn't all that great S: ) but nvm. Physics just... urgh. But I got other really good marks in other things, so if someone asked me how I did, I can honestly say, I really -don't know- :| I'm still happy though ^^"

(: I woke up at 3am this morning unable to sleep, so I began doing a few jobs and stuff, and then took the last of the painkillers and tried to get some more sleep. 

What really touched me was the fact that the people at college actually seemed concerned, even when I told them I was ok. Like they actually give a damn about me, it was nice ^^ 

Though of course you can guess who the person I gave most brownie points to was. Someone does a terribly good job of looking after me when I'm not 100%, and he was still suffering himself! Finn is such a star <3

Finn's coming round on Sunday too, I'm really looking forward to it, 'cos he's promised that we're going to watch some Stargate :D. I haven't a clue what my reaction's going to be, but since everyone goes on about it so much I guessed it must be something worth watching. And I get to spend some time with him, which always makes any week."

"event","Yup, it's that time of year again when I'm drowned in work assignments from my subject teachers. What annoys me is that they have to all set coursework round about the same time, so that I have three lots going on the trot, or one week it's physics the next it's biology and so on. So for this term every week I have some coursework or other to do.

I've never really been fond of coursework in all fairness, it's like a huge piece of homework that actually matters if you hand it in or not (not that I ever don't hand in homework you understand, but still). But anyway. It became a life saver last year, otherwise I probably wouldn't have got the grades that I did in some subjects, really a mark booster when your exams didn't go so hot. 

So I'm busy busy, trying to get it all done and at the same time not being able to bring myself to do it. It's always there at the back of your mind, nagging. Urgh.

On other notes, the first week back at college is going ok. I got my final letter from UCAS the other week, saying that I'd gotten all my offers through, so I popped along to the tracking system and firmly accepted my offer from Manchester (Leeds is my backup incase I don't get the grades or whatever). Whoot ^^ - it's nice to get everything sorted on that front, when other people are still waiting to hear, and for once I'm not the one in that position. I can say 'well, I know where I'm going...' next up will probably be the accomodation form, which I don't have any idea but oh well. :D

I don't mind going to do zoology. I can see it leading to a career on it's own, but that isn't really the point, I didn't get into veterinary, but I know I'm still going to love zoology because hey, it's like my forte ;) and perhaps I'll actually learn something new rather than being asked all the time to tell the whole class about metamorphosis or whatever. Funny, but embarassing since my Biology teacher has finally twigged that I'm the swotty/knowitall in the Biology class. Damn ... 

On a different subject, I shall be going to Crufts! ^^ A good friend of mine got two tickets for her birthday, and for some reason she thought of asking me along with her (perhaps because we're both such big animal enthusiasts) so yes, we're going on the hounds and terriers day because that's the one she wanted to go too (not so keen on the terriers, but I will get to see LOTS and LOTS of daxies <3) I'm going to try and get her to take a picture of me with a daxie :3 *cuted out* This is on the 10th, and I'm going to have to go back on the 10th too because I have a guitar competition on the Sunday (music for youth I /think/)

So that means I'm going to have to sort out next weekend aswell S: I can imagine Blythe still going to Dad's house, but no Dad visiting for me this time, it's not physically possible o_O.

This week I got talking to Alison, she's from Georgia and I've known her nearly 4 years now (she's 15) but yeah, she's one of the 'americans' who form the group of us that lived in and loved the site X_HogwartsSchool_X, a Harry Potter forum. It was probably our obsession for about 2 years straight, we all stayed up all night when the new books came out, we had regular msn mass conversation with much craziness and things like that. We all had nicknames based on characters from the books, so hehe, I was Remmy (Remus) and we had Hermy (hermione), Siri (guess that one), Sevvie (snape) etc... 

anyway, after I hit my GCSE's I got busier, and after that I couldn't talk so much. I'd still post on the forum but I could feel it getting quieter. One day Sev told us all she was leaving for a few months, She lived in India and her dad moved about a lot. But we didn't hear from her until a year later, and when she signed into msn it was her mother. The last time I heard from her personally was on her deviantart account, but all the same it was a long long time ago. 

In the meanwhile, fights broke out among us, some of the less regular members to the place decided to make their own forum, and of course, our admin Hermy, being the posessive type, didn't like this one bit. The group ended up splitting into two factions, Hermy and her followers, and the 'rebels' - these groups were subject to change at any time depending on who she favoured (apparently) but nobody knew what was going on, nobody knew who's side they were on or who was on which side and it was all very confusing. This all happened behind my back - I had fallen out of contact with them all over this time, occasionally talking to Alison. She told me every time things were /bad/ and after telling me exactly why, I proceeded to ignore it because I thought, well. Things will sort themselves out. We're all good friends here aren't we?

Wrong.

Last week I messaged Alison again to check upon how things are doing and discovered that Hermy no longer messages or speaks to anyone, not ever via email. If and when she does, she's very rude and very short with them. I'd noticed things on the actual forum were pretty dire but I hadn't imagined things could ever get this bad. I guess after being left to fester it had just grown and grown. Siri never contacted anyone, she was getting on with 'real life' (wants to get into the ivies, very clever girl indeed). Alison didn't really know what to do about it all, so after making sure she was ok I proceeded to message Siri. Thankfully I got a reply, and we got talking. After a while she came to the conclusion (and I very much agreed with this) that we were going to drift apart no matter what happened, because the only thing we'd ever had in common was Harry Potter, and after we'd all grown out of it, what was left to hold us together? Jack all - we didn't even know each other's proper names. Well, I did vaguely remember after the first introductions, but you get names wrong after 4 years don't you? After being so close it felt like it had all never happened, we were just a group of strangers scattered across opposite sides of the Atlantic. And we were growing up - next year would be final finals for two members, and I'd be shipping off to university. 

Still, I'm going to stay in touch as long as I can with Alison and 'Siri' (can't remember her name anymore) - they're still good friends and we do have things to talk about. It's like meeting people for the first time though, and I think this has to be my strangest, most difficult friendship ever."

"event","I had the wierdest dream last night.

I remember it first me and this group of say... three other people walking down this road in a deserted street to this building up a flight of metal stairs, at the top was a door. When we got there this young woman answered, but she was very scared and wary. But she invited us in anyway to see these people who had all become paralized from this unknown cause. But they weren't paralized in the sense that they were awake, they were comatose and kept on twitching and moaning. It was sort of like The Tribe in the sense that we were living in a post-apocalypic world and that these people were going to die if we didn't find out the cause of their illness, and a cure soon. 

So we left there and headed out into the countryside where these people had come from, we got told they had all said they'd come from this one house where they had been squatting until the 'danger' had passed. It was late at night when we finally reached his huge manor house, and finding it unlocked we all went in and started searching around for anything like rats or... any clues really. When I was looking around I got attacked my this man who held me hostage and started asking me questions about what was going on and why we were here. After a while I was rescued by one of my friends who looked very grim. Her and the man started talking like they had a history, and she said she was responsible for one of the illnesses, and that the other three were something different. One of the sick people was this man's wife who she'd had an affair with and transmitted an infection to him, which he'd passed to her. For some reason she'd shown symptoms and he'd been ok, but he was going to die faster than her because she'd got the symptoms and that meant you had a better chance to live. That meant that we had to try to save the other three, and the woman told me that she'd been researching into the disease before the apocalypse and found a compound in apples that helped. 

So I went back alone to the first place, and when I got there instead of the woman carer there was this old old man sitting at a table in a conservatory type thing, with a pile of apples on the table, he was incoherant and I tried to ask him if he'd given the ill people any of the apples. He'd obviously been eating them himself becase he had a half eaten on in one hand, and he had chunks of it in his mouth as he told me he couldn't get them to eat anything, not even if he mashed it up. Two of the ill people had already died and he'd contracted the illness - I had to get out of there quickly if I still wanted some chance of living so I ran out of the building. It was then I felt this sharp pain in my ankle and reaching down I found I'd been bitten my a spider - this was the cause of the paralysis and it wasn't a disease at all. Apples for some reason were the way to fight the toxin in it's bite, but since I'd run so far from the building I couldn't get back and I blacked out. 

and then I woke up. It was such a strange dream. :D"

So it sort of looks like my hair when I was about 12 - 13 and growing my layers out. Haha. I should have done before and after pictures but by the time I'd remembered, it was all too late. 

I've also finally been able to get a hold of my novel document, so that means more writing. There's a lot of random chapters written, and there's a lot of contradictions I need to get rid of, so it's fairly messy. For those of you who don't know the plots basically like this:-

Two twin brothers have inherited a large fortune their father left them. But even their father never found out where the fortune was hidden inside the large family home, it becoming his life's work to find it. So the story is about them trying to work together to find it, but both wanting it all for themselves, and both teaming up against their Father's 'coworker' as they're not entirely sure of his motives after he turns up at the house soon after the funeral. 

I dunno how interesting people are going to find it, there's quite a lot of supernatural stuff mixed into it (hey, it's me we're talking about here!) but it's fun to write. 

On other news, after all the gripes I've had over 1/2 term I guess I'm ok /really/. Yes it has been lonely and I have been pretty low for most of it, but I've found myself again. I know what 'me' is like, which I didn't sort of have these last few months, and helping other unhappy people out over msn or IRL has given me my purpose back (: so I've sort of found my personality again. So I guess I'm ready to tackle life again ^^ *corny* I can't wait to talk to Finn, but he said he's very tired so he'd better get some sleep before he talks to me.

I've done something different every day this holiday and it hasn't taken my mind off the fact I live in the middle of nowhere, and not even the glorious internet can take my mind off the fact that I have absolutely no social contact whatsoever. I think I'm beginning to lose my mind over how bored I am. 

At least my driving lesson went ok, I got to drive home since it was a 2 hour one, so that was fun because I knew the roads, so the gears and stuff just sort of came naturally, and of course I bombed up the hill. lol. 

Finn keeps on texting me from Austria, which is nice. I can tell he's enjoying himself because they're so disjointed and interspersed with random words, it only serves two purposes 1) lets me know that he's ok, and that he's happy. which is always a good thing 2) reminds me of my currently crap situation. I wouldn't want him to not text, but every day they seem to get more and more random, and it reminds me of the people in highschool who were like 'look at me, I'm being random!' which I don't know... I won't say anything. I'm should be thankful and glad he texts me. End of story. I think I feel so lonely because I can imagine him in the middle of a crowd of loads of people, being really funny and great and everything and everyone laughing and there's me, stuck here, forgotten. Which sucks.

I'm ok about it, because we were all expecting it would happen soon; he lost a lot of weight very rapidly and just began doing that old 'senile' cat thing where when you left him he just stared into space and didn't move. He was asleep most of the time, but it was still a bit of a surprise when it happened - he looked okish at tea time. Now we only have 3 cats left. And a stinky dog, and a parrot. 

Finn's also gone away from the whole holidays on the Ski Trip with college, which they've been planning for like... forever. Though I've been promised lots of post cards and text messages, and I'm looking forward to getting them, it still doesn't stop me from missing him. Some of my other friends have gone too; Phoebe to name just one, and I talk to her quite a bit.  

Apart from that, I had a friend round for dinner last night and we had quite a good time, she wanted to watch anime so I leant her Howl's moving castle after we didn't quite finish it (from the spirited away maker, based on a novel which I've also read) and we watched Vampire Hunter D, which she loved. 

I'll be doing a few things over the holiday, mainly going to leeds with Nathalie on Sunday to shop for hippy clothes for August and then on Friday I'm having my hair cut. Not rivetingly interesting (yes I made that word up), but I guess atm not much is happening. =)"

Lots of people today had Roses, even my friend Liz in Physics, her boyfriend had got her a bag full of stuff. And if you're thinking this is headed down the 'well I didn't get anything route' - you'd be wrong =)

I didn't want a present, and I don't like roses. I'd told Finn I didn't want anything for Valentines day, just that I wanted to spend some time with him ^^ so after college (we left at lunchtime 'cos it's a Wednesday and wohoo Scrabble club was cancelled!) we walked down to Sainsburies and bought some Gu. After that we sat on a bench and ate it while watching the pidgeons and talking about mutations and random things like that. Ok so not your typical Valentines day, but I preferred what we did to going out for a meal etc. (I like origional activities) and ok, the mother laughed at me because yes she got the boring old 12 roses and she was all traditional and things. But I don't care =D I had a great time. (We went home after that and played Guild Wars for the rest of the evening. Best Valentines day Ever.)"

On Friday, Finn had been invited to a friend's 18th - and since he had previously turned down an invite, he felt he couldn't really turn Alex down a second time. Though Finn didn't really fancy going on his own, so I offered to come with. I had also been invited but well, it wasn't really my thing ^^ (so really, I was just going so that Finn wouldn't be stuck there on his own)

So we went, and it was really snowy. The buses were having trouble getting up the hill to Holme at 5:30, so I doubted I was going to be able to get up there at 11 o'clock at night. But anyway, I got a free lift down into town, and I was allowed to crash at Finn's for a while until we could get a bus into town. 

We stayed at the party for an hour or so. It was what Alex had described as a 'posh bar' - and it was ok I guess, the highlight of the evening was when Amelia set her hair on fire. There were tea-lights set on the back of the setee, and she happened to lean back and... well - I imagine you can guess the rest. But we left quite early, and even then all but one taxi firm had stopped running, and many of the buses were only running direct to places. I realised that the Holme bus hadn't a chance in hell to get back, so we caught the next to last (parkhead) bus."

"event","This week went so slowly, and because I was doing my Physics coursework, and playing on GW, I haven't really had anything exciting to write about in my journal. Today was interesting though, as on Fridays a few of us get together to play poker 

And as usual I was hanging in by a thread for most of the game, sometimes James would get a little too cocky and raise by loads when actually, I had better cards than he did (It's funny to see his face when he realises I've beaten him - mwahahah!). Then at the end I won about three times then decided enough was enough and withdrew. 

I was a little dissapointed with it all this week because of several things; 
1) it was a little rowdier and people seemed to be messing about more than usual. Which to be fair, I do too, but it was far worse this week, it wasn't really 'fun'. 
2) people seemed more ruthless. Ok, I know poker is a ruthless game, but up until now it was how Finn had told me it would be; fun. This week everyone seemed hellbent on winning, and deploying really twisted strategies - clearly a few of the more avid fans of the game wanted to get ahead of everyone else, which perhaps spoilt it a little for me. 
3) The people who come in later than everyone else really don't stand a chance; by then the blinds have gone up more than they can afford - and people are getting more picky about when you can leave and things, which isn't really fair because we all work to different schedules. 

Still, if it's better next week I'll keep playing. If it's the same perhaps I will consider dropping out. I like poker a lot, but not when all the fun gets sucked out of it ^^

(I won my last hand - high straight incase anyone wonders)"

"event","Just about - since they seem to have made an effort to improve the ease of use. So I'll probably stick with this one now. Eh, my life seems spread out over three sites now. But I'll try to stick with my LJ. I really will ^^

But yes, I am impressed by the way they've organised the menu's into clear, easy to read pop-down jobbies. I'm not sure when it happened, but it's made this site far easier to use. So much so I thought 'hey, I'll come back here and give it a go'

First, some sad news. One of my cats has gone downhill over the weekend, all thin and 'old looking' and he just wants to sleep all the time, I looked and all his mucous membranes are all pale, so it's probably not a good sign. He's not eating, not drinking much, and just sleeps on the chair all day - saying that he has picked up, but I don't think he'll be with us much longer. 14 isn't really all that old either, not for our cats, but anyway. 

Second, I had another driving lesson today. My driving instructor seems to think I have a problem with confidence; but it isn't that - the hesitations aren't hesitations. Not when you take into account the fact that I'm waiting for the 18wheeler truck type thing to go across the road so I can drive safely across the junction *sigh*. He rambles on about something or other at the side of me, but I don't really pay attention anymore. He speaks quite a lot of rubbish I've noticed - I can't wait until my proper driving instructor comes back from Spain. She'll probably be all strict and stuff, but at least I won't have hour long lectures on confidence. 

On another note, I'm getting my hair cut all layered like over 1/2 term, which is a semi-birthday present... because last time I got it cut it didn't look like I got layers at all, and I want it to look more interesting that just this mass of brown hanging down from my scalp. Not a problem short haired people have I'm sure, but I can't stand having it untidy and scraggly in winter, my hair's so fine it just goes into this static mess ^^. Anyway enough of ranteth mucheth. I might try to do before and after photos.

So on Saturday it was Finn's 18th - I got taken out for dinner and a movie on Thursday; and we had a really great time. Beforehand we hadn't an idea of what movie to go and see; a lot of people said 'oh go see the pursuit of happiness' and if I was looking to go and watch a respectable movie, I probably would have nudged him and said, but I wasn't in the mood for a serious movie at the time. In the end we watched 'Night at the Museum' and yes, we were the annoying people who laughed out loud at all the funny parts, but you had to ;) it was one of those movies, and to be fair it impressed me. I thought it was going to be all atypical and stuff, but it was different; and I never got bored which is always a good thing =D (not that I can ever get bored with Finn around)

After the movie and food (subway ftw!) we caught the bus back to his house and then mucked around a bit, i.e. I got to see his mega computer a little, (very impressed - what else can I say?! =D) and just sat in the kitchen and talked until we decided it was time for me to go home. I decided to give him his presents early since it was conveniant, and because I think he deserved them early - it was really great to see that luckily, I'd made the right choice ^^

--

Apart from that, there's been a few things happening of minor importance, once I'm not allowed to tell (so I won't) and that's about it apart from that I have to pick an enrichment at college... I think I might end up going to scrabble club or risk club or some other leboring non-commital thing. There isn't anything that looks any good this term ^^ oh well. 

Over and out - hopefully I'll stick with this one =D"

okies, first off the whole stealing of my catchphrase 'Furry little Doofus of a Problem' on Myspace...urgh she had NO RIGHT, I mean, there was no permission asked, she just whapped it onto her picture and got a shit load of credit and laughs for it. That really pissed me off. 

second, I've noticed how depressed I get with not talking to Finn, I mean, I haven't heard from him since Friday, properly that is (Sat he had to pack and Sunday he couldn't talk much) but I miss him so much having to just talk over Msn and not being able to see him every day - ok call me pathetic, but this is what having those sorts of feelings does to you, it eats you up inside; I have this horrible heavy ache just below my heart and I'm sick of it. 

And I can't be bothered with this whole guitar thing tomorrow - I wish I'd never agreed to go -_-'

The first lecture was -boring- and I hadn't a clue what the man was talking about; I mean, I knew he was talking about Einstein's theory of relativity, but at the end it didn't answer my burning question - what the crudler is relativity?!?!?! aanywho's I fell asleep in that one so yeah =/ one minute he was talking about relativity, the next moment pidgeons (i'd been asleep for about 15 mins)

yes, the second was good because the man was a doctor and he talked about all the hilarious stories involving his patients, plus he had liquid nitrogen which, to Finn was about as good as lasers, so you guess how much fun that was to watch =3 plus he frozzed a daffodil 8D

the third one was boring, and meh...about like...energy blah blah conservation

and the last one was sorta cool because it was about CERN (<3) and fusion and quantum physics (<3) so I actually understood what he was talking about =3 

and you should have seen the Haggmeister's face when the man said 'de brog-lee' (de broglie) instead of pronouncing it 'de broy' he was turning in his grave! (because he always tells us off for saying it that way xD) Bless

anywho's apart from that the trip was kinda crap, apart from where Guy got really stressed, but I can't remember what about, it's just funny to see him fly off the handle at anything and everything *petpets* poor boy...he was missing Dr Lockwood methinks ;)

I really hope this movie isn't a hoax, I doubt it, but I'm starting to read several sources that suggest it is. Of course, you can't believe everything the internet tells you...yeah that works both ways though. 

They said it was going to be released christmas 2005

now it's christmas 2006 >.<'' I can't waits anymores!

I think they think that because the site didn't get updated for absolutely ages. But the one thing that bothers me is that for a fact, I know that 

- A straight movie (i.e. one with not many CGI elements) Takes around 6 months to shoot (Actually, I think it was three or something o_O)

- A trilogy can take like...5 years (i.e. LOTR)

- A movie like the last unicorn is going to take around a year/year and a half AT MOST...including all the post and preproduction editing. Because yeah - that stuff takes far longer than the actualy shooting, and by the look of things, they've pretty much done all the pre-production stuff. So...how long was that? I don't know how long the site existed for, or when it's been recently updated, but urgh...the site doesn't even give clear indication to what stage their at - the storyboarding could have been finished months ago.

I just want them to get their backsides in gear. 

but now owning the book, reading the book, and having the film on tape and DVD, I think I'm getting pretty obsessed"

"event","All in all, I thought it was an excellent movie, don't get me wrong. 

However, there were a few things that I thought could have been done a little better, so don't read if you don't want spoilers. 

Firstly, I have no quarms about setting the scene, I mean, the war bit brought tears to my eyes. But after that, if took them a whole hour just for them all to actually get to Narnia, and that was, in a word, tedious. 

Then I thought the rest of the movie was a little rushed. You see Edmund and Peter practice swordfighting once, then when it comes to the battle, they're bloody brilliant all of a sudden. The same goes for Susan. So yeah. 

But it was cast extremely well, and even 'Lucie' was very well done, because sometimes I can find that very young children act very wooden, and say the lines as if someone's told them how to say them; very unnatural. But there didn't seem to be any problem with that at all here. The only quarms I had with her character was when Aslan was 'dead' she was standing there, grinning away before she finally crinkled up and started crying. And my dad swears she mumbled 'pussy' really quietly before laying herself on his head, but he didn't want to laugh and kill the tension XDD aww man...

The other kids were good, and well...good. There isn't much else I can say about them. 

But the white witch...man she was awful! Where's the scariness! She looked like some sort of ikky alien freak type thing. I had issues with her eyelashes -_-' major big time...

Aslan was good though. 

And Tumnus -is- smesshy dammit! *I think I'm developing a <A HREF=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/elfi_pipkin/2420.html"">Fawn Complex</A>*

Apart from that n.n'

I don't know if I can even write what they said in here, I was so embarrased, and of course I easily blush, but that of -course- meant that said accusation was true. *tschuh*

People don't understand me -at- all. 

It annoyed me that said accuser then tried to cover up said mistake by accusing me of something. Yes, because it makes it all better by making me feel bad about something. But I'm not cross with her anymore, because it's my fault for lashing out like that. 

Note to self: Some people are very religious. Some Christian beliefs are hard installed, and are not easily made to see otherwise. They just get offended. 

Note to self: Don't say anything controversial about Christ. 

I...should stop making such a big deal out of this. I shouldn't overreact so much."

In other news, the physics department have really craptacular christmas decorations up, and guess who has a tree made of white tinsel? Yes -_-'' it even has...wait for it...4 LED's as lights. OMFG.

And they were putting on a televised play this afternoon about the discovery of Quantum physics (we have wednesday afternoon's off) and well..I'd go, but I had to go to highschool and pick up my coursework. 

Except they didn't have it. But I still got the bus I would've gotten normally. 

Then I watched an awesome thing on Anglo-saxon cremation, and they were reconstructing the face of this random anglo-saxon woman o_O...she was kind of butch to say the least. Then I saw a programme about british wildlife. 

Now I am going out for dinner. After dinner I'm going to watch another wildlife programme. But this time, David Attenborough's presenting it, not some stupid ameteurs, I mean, when this guy dies (hopefully not any time soon) All wildlife programmes just aren't going to be the same. Sir David was the person I used to watch when I was little, I mean he -introduced- me to the whole world of zoology, that and those millions of encyclopedia's I have on my bookshelves. Yay for me."

(When you get any piece of meat from the butcher, they have to cut it for health and safety reasons, so you can imagine when it's a lung, all the air'll escape from the slits) Hehe, anywho's I was getting a little bored, so I opened the slit a little and lo and behold, it made a fart noise ._.

On other notes, I've got a concert on Thursday for Music Centre which is like the Christmas concert thing. At least I ain't playing solo like last easter, so nothing much to worry about. I'll still get ol' shaky hands and all, with sweaty fingertips, but it happens everytime. I don't know why, because deep inside, I'm not even frightened on getting up on that stage. Maybe it's the adrenaline rush. I think I'm an adreneline junky from playing the guitar though, there was a phase where I wouldn't say anything, but I'd get angry if someone got a better part than me; that's what too many solo's does to you kids! I'm weaning myself off that though; I said I'd help the less experienced players with their parts, even though the part's far too easy for me, I think it does me good - stops me getting big headed. Because I remember how much I hated all those guitarists who sat their showing off on the NYGE and never even acknowledged people. So yeah.

I mean, FINALLY!

Just so happy it all works and things, credit to the maker (Above image) and so on and so forth. There was a few HTML errors I had to iron out, and we all know how bad I am at HTML. 

Well, most people (inculding me of course) only post journal entries when they're either upset, angry, or the world generally isn't doing a good thing. 

Aanywhoodles, if people actually want to hear what goes on in my life, then yay, but if not, well I like writing in here anyway n.n

For starters, I'm in a good mood because 

a) I had a massive talk about games with one of my bestest best friends whom I love mostest more. And talking about games without having to be all secret about it like I did in Highschool makes me happy, because I like talking about games. 

b) I had physics. 


So, now you're thinking 'gee, I never thought a female nerd could exist' but bah, I don't care, let the geekiness rule supreme n.n'' It's who I am, gettit over it! And for reference, I actually find physics boring, in an interesting sort of way, but what makes it my faveourite lesson is the teacher. 

I mean, he is a walking joke. The stuff I could write *sigh* but that would take too long, instead, I'm just going to tell you what made today's lesson the highlight of my day

1) He pulled a face at us, as in, a little kiddy face as in 'ner ner ner ner ner' *sqweesh* n.n!!

2) He did the 'rubbing rod' thing -again- but it was so much more worstest this time...he started talking about floppy and erect >.<''' *soo hard to keep a straight face*

3) He didn't even tell me to stop eating skittles, which I had out, on my desk, in plain view. And I was sharing them with everyone else. XD

man, I love those 'just outta Uni no idea' kind of teachers. You can get away with anything and everything!"

1. sit in the middle of a closed room that shares a wall with another room in which people are talking. imagine they are talking about you.

2. travel to a foreign country in which you have a minor understanding of the language (italy is quite good for francophones, scandanavia for most germanophiles). sit in a cafe or public place, listening to the surrounding conversations. imagine they all concern you personally.

3. if unable to travel abroad, sit in a cool, damp basement near a generator or other heavy operating equipment. rest your head against a vibrating surface. sing the songs and lyrics that come into your head.

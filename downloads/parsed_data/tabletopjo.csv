"event","I think there's a basic flaw in saying that ignorance is part of the answer to ""How can anyone eat meat?"" I'm not saying that people should eat meat, and I'm not saying that most people aren't ignorant of its origin, but I think that most people who aren't ignorant of meat's origin are not vegetarian.

I think the people who are most knowledgeable about what goes on in meat production are ranchers, slaughterhouse employees, butchers, farmers, owners and stock holders of ranches and slaughterhouses, etc.--and most of them (I would guess ALL of them) eat meat even though they are confronted daily with the origin of it.

Before factory farming, say before 1850, almost everyone knew what raising and killing an animal entailed yet very few were vegetarian. I just don't see how the main cause of meat-eating is ignorance... I think the main cause of meat-eating is that no matter what most people are shown or told or read about, they don't care what happens to a cow or a pig or an animal... and most people don't care what happens to humans either unless it's right next to them, otherwise Amnesty International would be more successful and our prison system wouldn't be so horrible.

Ignorance as an answer belies the possibility that most people don't care and can't be made to care."

"event","sophia, your movie star double is Angelina Jolie 

A wild child like you needs to be played by someone who's not afraid to live life on the edge, someone who doesn't mind bending the rules a little when necessary, someone like Angelina Jolie. While you may not be the kind of person to tattoo your true love's name on your body, we still think Angelina would perfectly capture your adventurous attitude toward life.

Back in high school, were you the one harassing the substitute teacher and freaking out your folks by driving too fast? Well, even if you weren't climbing out your bedroom window and into a carfull of your pals late at night, you probably had your own ways of pushing the envelope and making adults turn gray before their time.

Like Angelina, you probably still like playing hard, that's the way you can really experience life. Leave the armchairs for other people. You, like your movie star double, prefer an edge that makes you feel alive. Angelina never apologizes for the decisions she's made, probably because they've been right for her regardless of what others say. Sound familiar?"

Whether you know it or not, this is the role that is most in tune with who you are at your core.

You are able to coordinate essential details to ensure maximum progress toward a goal, while eliminating non-essential ones, which gives you a knack for creating efficiency. You trust your gut feeling about things and this makes you thoughtful and skilled at the organization of complex ideas. People admire your wisdom and you make them believe that anything is possible. You are outgoing, charismatic, reliable, and expect the best from people, but it might appear at times that the bottom line is what interests you most. You will only alienate people this way, when you should remember that your real strength lies in your supportive nature that typically inspires people to meet their goals and feel you are a refuge in a chaotic world."

I am not saying ethical veganism is ""ethically different"" than
veganism religion or personal choices. What I am saying is that the
end result is different. If I choose not to eat ""meat"" and then
literally see ""meat"" as a corpse that turns my stomach, it is
different than choosing not to eat ""meat"" because of its cholestoral
content or because I believe the Bible prohibits it. This is what I'm
trying to get at when I say that being an ethical vegan isn't just
something that is a preference, or a lifestyle that is included when
people say we need to ""respect everyone's choices."" Perhaps that
makes me a fundamentalist, I don't know. But calling me names isn't
very cooperative, especially when I don't think you are really
grasping my point.

Put it this way: If you are a staunch pro-life person and you really,
really think that life begins at conception, there is no compromise
position. There isn't any ""acceptance"" of the other point of view.
There is not room for coming together and deciding what's ""morally
acceptable"" for both points of view (pro-life and pro-choice).
Because, by the way you view things, abortion is murder, period. Now,
as such a person you can choose to wage war against the ""other side""
and be a real a**hole about putting down other people (the bad choice,
in my opinion) or you can try to educate people about how a compromise
isn't possible because it isn't such a situation in which you're able
to compromise your beliefs (life begins at conception and so all
abortion is murder). You will likely agree that reducing the number
of abortions is a positive thing, and acknowledge that ensuring that
abortions that are performed are done in the least harmful manner is a
good thing. But neither of those steps really addresses the staunch
pro-life point: abortion is bad, no matter what, and it is wrong, no
matter what.

I see ethical veganism as a similar situation. Is reducing ""meat""
consumption a positive step? Yes. Is trying to alleviate the
suffering of farmed animals a positive thing? Yes. Does it really
address the ethical beliefs and concerns of an ethical vegan?
Absolutely not. That doesn't mean I advocate steps against those who
eat ""meat"" (just as I would not advocate the pro-lifer's violence
against or hatred of pro-choicers). It does mean that there is no no
""can't we all accept each other's food preferences"" here.

This doesn't mean I would remove myself from a non-vegan co-op. I
don't know the answer to that question, and I'd have to wait and see.
What I want, right now, is simply for people to see the moral
difference between making choices for one reason versus another, which
I think a lot of people aren't grasping here. Obviously in my life I
am force to accept less-than-ideal situations all the time. I'm not a
recluse who refuses to engage in worldly situations because my ethics
are being violated. What I'm trying to voice here is that we should
try to make this be a situation analogous to the pro-lifer investing
in a birth-control clinic rather than funding abortions. I don't know
if that makes sense, but it's the best I can come up with.

As far as giving people what they want, which is what a number of
people have said about the low-income people who live in the proposed
area, I'm not sure that should be our guiding principle. What people
want and what's ethical are sometimes different things. This should
not be considered to the point where it will devastate the very idea
of a co-op, but it shouldn't be the principle used to guide our
decisions (after all, there is a high demand for drugs and underage
sex clubs but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do to satisfy
that demand).

Lastly, I want to say that I'm not intending to offend anyone here.
I'm trying to get my point across, which seems to be lost on many
people. I think that before consensus can occur, we all need to
understand each other's perspective.

Thanks to all the vegans who have, off of the list, offered their support.

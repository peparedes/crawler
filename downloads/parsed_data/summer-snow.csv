"event","Sooo... here's a snapshot of my month so far:

I met a great girl I really liked who said she liked me back BUT she lives in canada and isn't in the right ""headspace"" to get into a new relationship.

Becky e-mails me to say she's going to be in Atlanta last weekend and then doesn't return my phone calls or emails once she gets here. We fight, I blow up and now I'm torn between my angry and pissed off. 

I spend so much energy dreading my trip to Alabama to visit my family that I have a freak accident, stab myself in the eye with a comb and lacerate my cornea. Three hundred dollars later I'm broke, in pain, but still in the good GA. Note to self - be careful what you ask for. 

As ususal there is good mixed in with the bad. After all, I did avoid allerbammy. I'm also becoming increasingly comfortable communicating my wants and needs and defining my boundaries in interpersonal relationships. I've learned a valuable lesson about focusing energy to materialize desired outcomes. Its just that the delivery of these lessons happens to suck."

I need a lover to give me
The kind of love
That will last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away

I want a lover who knows me
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights
Till the dawn
Why don't you take me away

Dreamlover come rescue me
Take me up take me down
Take me anywhere you want to baby now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around
'Cause I wanna share forever with you baby
I don't want another pretender
To disillusion me one more time
Whispering words of forever
Playing with my mind

I need someone to hold on to
The kind of love that won't fly away
I just want someone to belong to
Everyday
Of my live
Always
So come and take me away

Take me up take me down
Take me anywhere you want to baby now
I need you so desperately

"event","This has been the most boring week at school. Each year we're forced to sacrifice an entire week of instructional time to give the kids a meaningless standardized test required by the state for graduation. I'm not completely against the idea of exit exams, I just think they should be administered like the SAT - on a Saturday in a completely controlled environment. Of course it would also help if the kids were actually being tested on something meaningful that matched the level of diploma they were working towards and the type of coursework they had actually been taking. Under this system the college track kids find the questions ridiculously easy while the general or vocational level kids struggle to pass. Instead the whole school stops for three hours a day four days this week to while the juniors are tortured with a stupid, meaningless excuse for an exit exam. Grrr. I'm also cranky because I'm broke and it is still two weeks until payday. Guess I'll go to bed now and hope for a better tommorrow. Night."

"event","My friend K was visiting me for the evening and I asked her to take a look at my bathroom and tell me whether or not she thought it was ""pretty"". I hated it, but felt guilty because this was the second time in six months that I'd invested in new bathroom decorations after I decided I hated the old ones. K surprised me by telling me that the problem wasn't what I was picking out in the way of decorations it was the way I felt about the bathroom in general. She pointed out in the several years that she's known me I have consistently redorated my bathroom about every three months, usually in shades of pastel blue, yellow or green, none of which are my favorite colors. Blue was her favorite color, green was L's and yellow was to pacify M, an old roommate who'd really liked the idea of rubber duckies. Whats really weird is that I associate light yellow and green with illness. Light blue is washed out and makes me feel drained. She asked me what color my bathroom wanted to be. It was the weirdest question. I had never considered it before. What colors make me feel good, or energized? I had no clue. Today I found a beautiful dark moss green velvet showercurtain at macy's for 11$. I paired it up with a really funky red-orange ribon rug from Pier One and black lotus flower candle holders and goblet. The room now has weird, yet fun and playful vibe. Its the most I've ever liked a bathroom. I'm excited about figuring out what sort of towels will look best in the room. I'm thinking black, but who knows?"

"event","M and I spent most of today on a blanket in Piedmont Park. It was the first day this year when the weather was perfect.... a blue, blue sky, whispy clouds and lots of sunshine. All at a perfect 65 degrees. It was heavenly, and it seemed as if the entire city turned out to enjoy the day. People brought their dogs and their kids, it was awesome just to be outside and hang out watching people pass by. Its rare to see so many people look so happy and carefree. Highlights of the day were: Weinerfest '06 - two gay couples walked by and between them they had three full grown dogs and a pup. Cuteness and yapping abounded, I've never seen an animal whose rear end seems to move like a separate entity before. M swears that their hind legs are so far away from the front that it takes an extra couple of seconds to get the ""move"" message, explaining the characteristic weiner dog waggle. About an hour later we were lying down drowsing when a couple of preteen girls walked by. After a lot of giggling and a couple of ""I dare you's"" one approached and squeaked out ""Are you GAY?!!"" before turning tail and hauling ass in the oppisite direction. M and I took one look at each other and started laughing so hard we looked like a couple of preteens ourselves. Sometimes I miss junior high. lol. Finally after much spasming I managed to call out ""Yeah"" while she shouted ""I'm not but she is"" as we continued to laugh ourselves silly. The kids looked at us like we were crazy and gave us a pretty wide berth after that. I think the whole thing struck us both as being pretty ridiculous because a) it was midtown and there are actual gay people everywhere and b) we get mistaken for a couple all the time because we're both pretty touchy-feely. We're used to constantly confusing people, and sometimes we even play it up deliberately if we can tell someone is being really obnoxiously homophobic, but this time we really were completely innocent. She was reading a book and I was pratically asleep and still we're targets? Honestly, people need to lighten up. And teach their kids some manners. Its ok to ask if we're gay. lol. Just stick around for the answer."

M and I had Chinese food for the second time in two years today. This was amazing because her Chinese animosity rivals my Mexican fiasco. Afterwards we scarfed down the world's best ice cream at Maggie Moos. I know, I know, seriously uncool name (you should see the lady cow mascot) but the cheesecake, dark chocolate and coconut flavors are divine.  We paid for the indulgence though. On the way home M got sick, so we had to postpone our Target adventures until tommorrow. 

In other news I am seriously, unbelievably broke. I have one dollar in my checking account, seventy-eight cents in my bank account and twenty-two dollars in cash. Hopefully I will be paid Friday instead of next Tuesday. However, I did get my W-2's in the mail today. If I'm lucky I'll get most of my money back. Also, I signed up to do after school tutoring in either US history or Citizenship/Geography. If I get the gig it could mean an extra hundred dollars a week. *sweet* I really hope that works out. 

Friday afternoon I started my stint as assistant coach for the drama club. V is going to take care of the actors, while I organize the techies. The first meeting went well. I don't know much about set design, lighting or any of the other things I'm supposed to be coordinating, but I am a fairly efficient organizer. Hopefully that will be enough. 

I'm also planning on augmenting my summer paycheck by teaching summer-school. Right now I plan on putting all that money in the bank in case of an emergency. I'm also trying to work out more and learn more about nutrition. Of course I have a couple of ulterior motives for all of this self-improvement and activity. One, I want to keep busy so I don't have time to focus on negative things and two I'm really tired of being broke. We'll see how it goes. 

Lastly, I actually found a new fantasy novel to read today. Its about a girl who gets raised by wolves and is transplanted into dynastic European society where she turns out to be -- heir to the throne. Mmmmmm.... cheese. Don't laugh. You know you want to read it!"

By that time I typically feel like collapsing in front of the tv and having dinner delivered to me. Tonight, not only was I able to leave early, I actually got a random phone call from Katie asking if I wanted to go to dinner. That was enough to perk me up even after my depressing conversation with the claims specialist at my insurance company. *sigh* I don't know if I mentioned it in a previous post, but on January 7 someone hit my car during the night while it was parked in my apartment complex. They left a pretty big dent in the body of the car and took out the red plastic covering the driver's side tail light. Accordiing to the adjuster the entire bill is going to total $1,163.00. I'm responsible for the five hundred dollar deductible, but GEICO is going to pay the rest, plus put me up in a rental car for the estimated eight days mine is going to be in the shop. Needless to say I'm going to have to save up for that extra five hundred dollars, so Blaine won't be going to the shop for another couple of months. I soooo resent having to come up with that kind of money because someone else is too inconsiderate to leave a phone number when they fuck up.

In other news I saw one of the ugliest hair cuts I've ever seen this afternoon. It was someone with naturally dark hair who had shaved herself a mohawk, which she had tried to bleach platinum blonde. To finish off the look she'd added a pair of extra long stringy side-burns dyed to match the mohawk. The effect was not flattering at all. I'm a lot bigger fan of the completly shaved head. Or if you must have a mohawk, don't get the sideburns. Similarly, if you must have multi-colored hair, why not try something interesting like a really rich blue or intense red? Bleached blonde nasty looks good on very few people. 

I'm giving tests to all three of my classes tomorrow. As a teacher, I've found test days to be some of the most relaxing days of the year. I can almost always count on at least a couple of kids to take the entire period to take the test, which means that the others will be forced to work on book work in absolute silence until the last test is turned in. Aside from monitoring the test to make sure none of my kids are cheating, I have almost nothing to do. I anticipate tomorrow being a very nice Friday. Of course review day isn't bad either. I always organise a game so that my kids can play for bonus points. 

Random note to self -- take garbage to dumpster ASAP. (One of my least favorite chores. I would gladly cook and clean the rest of the house if I didn't have to deal with the garbage and the bathroom.)

When I moved to college my allergies mysteriously disappeared. I thought I had somehow magically escaped whatever plants were causing me so much misery, but I after eight years in the good GA it seems my body has adjusted. I know that its technically January and thus, still winter, but thanks to rampant consumerism and global warming the weather no longer agrees with me. Its been around 70 degrees here for at least the past two weeks. The plants think its time to mate, the kitties think its time to shed and my sinuses are going haywire. I have spent the past two weeks in a sort of Benadryl induced haze.... some days I couldn't feel my extremities and there were random points every afternoon when I felt close to passing out. I actually had to stop taking the stuff during the day and start medicating only at night when exclusively through my nose was absolutely necessary. Most recently, my skin has become scaly and dry no matter how much lotion I slather on and my sinuses are so dry that I'm experiencing random nose-bleeds. Trying to teach a class full of overly concerned teenagers is quite fun while your nose is packed with tissue paper and your head tilted back as far as it will go. Not to mention that being sick always puts me in the best of moods anyway. Yesterday I found myself entertaining thoughts of hauling the person at the stop sign in front of me out of their car and dragging them by the hair of the head to the back of their SUV where I would teach them a thing or two about driver etiquette by forcing them to spend two minutes sucking in the nasty carbon monoxide that their gas-guzzling, emissions challenged piece of shit was putting out. Then I realized that this would undoubtedly result in my arrest which I would have a hard time explaining to the PSC as they promptly set about yanking my teaching certificate. So I settled for a dirty glare and sneezed and sniffled my way through the rest of my day. 

I hate the heat, and my sinuses."

"event","I seem to be going through my own series of slightly unfortunate events. Nothing earth-shattering, just bumps in the road. For instance....

I woke up this morning and headed out to spend the day with Magan. However when I got to my car I noticed that it had mysteriously aquired a very unsightly dent/ broken tail light. I called my insurance company only to be reminded that yes indeedy I do have full coverage which does include uninsured moterists insurance, but I also have a five hundred dollar deductible. *yikes*. Um... I don't have five hundred dollars. But... the car is still driveable and I'm entitled to a free estimate given by an agent who will actually drive out to my school to assess the damage. Good to know. So I call the police to file the necessary report, and I'm told that ""an officer will be out shortly."" MMMM... Ok, but what does shortly mean? The police are notoriously busy when it comes to non-emergencies. Looks like I'm going to spend my entire day waiting for them. But nope, I get a call back saying that an officer will be calling me later in the day to take my report by phone. So I get Magan time, and the day's not totally ruined, just off to a late start. 

We have lunch at Chick-fil-A. Its like crack. yummy. 

On to Lenox so that Magan can check out the Victoria's Secret semi-anual sale. Which turns out to be quite a show. Imagine about two hundred women frantically searching through bins of underwear. Two hundred TINY women. Magan was able to find one pair of extra-large panties which I have to admit were the ugliest pair of panties I have ever seen come out of a Vickies. And the bras only went up to a size 38 DD. As someone who wears a 40C Magan was a sad, sad kitty. After about an hour of fruitless searching she decided to console herself in Macy's shoe department. Where we spent another hour frantically searching for one pair of size nines. According to Magan, it sucks to be average. But.... I don't know. I think I'd sell my left kidney to be average. 

We finally left the mall and retreated to Phoenix and Dragon where things were guaranteed to be wonderful. Sure enough, she found a statue of the Virgin she'd been looking for and I located a perfectly wonderful carving of the goddess that I couldn't afford, but hopefully can save up for. I did make it out with an interesting print of Hecate, so that was happiness. We also dropped by Michael's where I found some nice yarn for a new project, pretty sage greens and gray-blues.

After a quick stop at Target we had dinner at Bridgetown grill where we enjoyed Black and White soup before heading back to Phipps for a showing of Hostel. I, at least, had high hopes for a horror flick put out by Tarrantino, but alas, it was fairly predictable. I was surprised however, that anyone made it out alive. Anyhoo.. I finally made it home only to discover that there were no parking spaces available on my side of the complex. I drove around hunting for about fifteen minutes before giving up and parkiing on the other side. Its going to be a very long hike up that hill tommorrow when I have to go to the grocery store. I think I'm going to go play with my new yarn for a few minutes before jumping into bed."

Magan and I rang in the New Year by finishing off a bottle of Asti after feasting at the Cheesecake Factory (where we spent way too much paper!). By midnight we were actually back at her place watching the remake of the Amityville Horror and drinking homemade Pina Coladas..... mmmm... thanks Captain Morgan :) I finally stumbled home to pass out around three am, and didn't wake up until two this afternoon. I indulged supersticion by scarfing up some luck and money at Roasters (black-eyed peas and creamed spinach -- yum) and then came back home where I ended up renting movies with Tarrah who snored her way through Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. It was ok. I'm going to indulge my white trash roots in a minute and watch the Dukes of Hazzard. I'm almost ashamed to admit that it was probably three or four year old Sara's favorite show, but hey, I'm from Bammy -- what can you do? I did however restrain myself from seeing the remake in theaters and I DO cringe everytime I see the stars and bars on General Lee. *sigh* There went my lame attempt at redeeming myself. Oh well, I get my jollies laughing at rednecks. I guess there are worse guilty pleasures. 

At any rate all is well in kittyville. Hope everyone had a fabulous New Year!"

"event","I think this being off my schedule thing has finally caught up to me. I didn't sleep well at all last night, tossing and turning, hovering on the edge of consciousness all night long. Right before I woke up this morning I had a dream about Agnes in which I'd been magically transported back to the point when I was first entering college. Sometimes I have dreams where I'm aware that I'm dreaming and am able to manipulate the dream to suit my needs and this was one of those. I was going through all the motions and activities of orientation weekend while at the same time standing outside of myself and mourning the fact that this wasn't, couldn't be real. Just before waking I went on this kind of surrealistic trip where I was the wind blowing across campus, paying tribute and carressing all the spots I knew and loved. I woke up with this overwhelming sadness and the knowledge that I'd never be able to go ""home"" again. Odd to think that ""home"" the place where you feel safest and most comfortable might be a lost chapter of your life. Sad to think that college was the first place I ever really felt at home. Anyway, I woke up feeling all fucked up and called Magan because we were supposed to have plans today. Even while dialing the phone I knew she wasn't at home. I woke up at around 12:15 which means that she got pissed off about two hours ago and instead of calling me decided to passively punish me by going out with Monica instead. Sure enough, she was at the mall, shopping with Monica. With the ready excuse that she thought we weren't hanging out until this evening. Which is stupid because I told her last night that I'd call her when I got up this morning. But I guess its ok, because I'm a sad and slightly irritable kitty anyway. Not really fit for human contact. Oh well, I guess it stands to reason that the last day of the year would kind of suck. Goddess knows the rest of it hasn't been that great. I think I'll take a shower, grab some lunch and go wander the city for a while."

"event","Goddess, I am tired. I spent most of today roaming, looking for some way to occupy myself. Of course, when I say most of the day, I'm actually only talking about a three hour time span. For the past couple of days I've been staying up until one or two o'clock in the morning and getting up at one or two in the afternoon. This is probably as far from my normal schedule as I could possibly get - especially since I'm down to one meal a day. I'm not sure why I've been on such a passively self-destructive kick recently, but it certainly has been appealing. This afternoon I woke up at about one-thirty and immediately started planning another food/yarn run (the only two reasons I've voluntarily left my house in the past several days). I went out for pizza, and was on my way to the yarn store when I found myself randomly dialing Magan's number. Which is pretty stupid if you know her schedule - she almost never gets home from work before eight, especially not on Friday when she gets her hair done. Surprisingly, she answered the phone. Which is how I ended up going to see Brokeback Mountain this evening. I haven't cried at a movie in a long time, but by the end I found silently sobbing with that lump in my throat and ringing in my ears that lets me know I'm really about to loose it and have a good old-fashioned crying jag. You know, the kind where you just let it all go and truly mourn for yourself and your people. Its sad that it takes a film to ignite that type of emotional catharsis, but I think that all too often I try to block out or ignore all the little hurts I experience or watch others experience in the interests of survival. Sometimes it seems as if I learned very early to dissassociate myself from pain in order to avoid drowning in it. I felt like I was drowning tonight. How can anyone watch this movie and not mourn the hate that twists so many lives? How can people hang on to prejudice of any kind, knowing the damage it wreaks? Sometimes I want to move away, far away, to where there aren't any people to hate, or fight or just generally fuck things up. Sometimes I want to stay and fight, to carve out a community free of violence and oppression and full of all the beauty that humanity has to offer. Most of the time I'm too busy just trying to survive to think about anything at all. Tonight I just feel like mourning for all of us, because I'm not sure theres any solution to these problems that plague our species. How can you heal something thats never been whole?"

"event","Caution: Rant in Progress. I hate people who prey on others. While in allerbammy this weekend I came across a magazine article on a herbal supplement called hoodia that is being marketed as a miracle cure appetite suppressant. As most of you know, I am fat. Not fat in that girly ""I need to loose 20 lbs"" kind of way, but fat as in ""I am more than one hundred pounds overweight, and might truthfully be called morbidly obese"" kind of way. Until recently I had never volutarily exercized a day in my life, nor had I ever made any attempt to regulate what I ate. Truthfully, I had more important things to worry about like finding a way to support myself financially while struggling with bipolar disorder. Now that I have a stable career and good health insurance I've been able to devote more time and energy to re-evaluating my choices regarding food and activity levels and the consequences of each. Fortunately, I don't believe in a miracle cure. I know that in order to become more healthy I have to change my eating habits and up my activity level. But there is an entire industry devoted to helping people find the ""magic pill"" that will give them the body they so desperately want (but are unwilling to work for). It makes me really angry and sad that such companies are allowed to engage in marketing activities that prey on people's insecurities and weaknesses and may actually prevent them from getting real help or advice. People are making millions off the misery of others.... shouldn't there be something we can do about it?"

"event","Ah, southern gothica, that eccentric, wickedly sadistic essence that provides that infamous southern flavor. Like any good southern girl my favorite emotion is laughter through tears, which was served up in spades at the Walker family Christmas this year. Highlights of the weekend include: projectile vomiting, stuffy vibrators and a mangled christmas duck. 

Long story short, the entire family got the stomach flu two days before I got home. Of course no one bothered to tell me until I was walking out the door. Around 10 pm on Christmas Eve my first gift to the family arrived - I covered the entire hallway with projectile vomit. My last meal? Chili con carne from a Mexican restaurant managed by one of my brother's regular customers at the titty bar. It had soured big time. I may never eat Mexican again. My poor grandmother had to clean it up as I shivered in the shower to the sound of my brother shrieking ""come on down here and get this virus."" 

I spent most of Christmas day in bed wishing I was dead. The next day I was on the way to recovery, but still too weak to make the trip home. (I couldn't even stand for very long, my ribs hurt so much.) Today's trip home was slow and painful, though joyous. Even more joyous was arriving home to find all my possessions still here and my kitties neglected but alive. (As far as I can tell, Tarrah never once entered the apartment.) In other good news I got some cash and a very nice digital camera for Christmas, my family liked their presents, and it is a VERY long time until Christmas 2006, by which I hope to have made a full recovery."

in other news, i finished reading 'A Great and Terrible Beauty,' which turned out to be pretty good, despite having been marketed as a sort of gothic/victorian/fantasy novel for teens. ever since the emergence of harry potter i've been prone to randomly checking out the kiddie section at local bookstores, and have, in my rambles, discovered several things. 1) there is a series in the teen section called 'rainbow boys' which seems to be sort of a 'queer as folk-lite' for the kiddie set. while i applaud the fact that gay teens can now find themselves represented on the shelves of the teen section at your local barnes and nobles, i resent the fact that book one opens with a sexual fantasy in which one of the main characters contemplates 'jumping his best friends bones'. ummmm.... as a lesbian i have no problem with books portraying homosexual erotica -- for all consenting adults, bring it on :) but based on my experience the kids who dally in the ""teen section"" are usually between 12-15 years old. if i were a parent i wouldn't want my kids reading anything at that age with more overt sexuality than could be found oh say, harry potter for instance. you don't need to jump someone's bones to have a plot. its part of why kids are so sexually mature at such young ages these days, and it sucks. a fifteen year old should be worrying about their first kiss, not about whether or not they're going to get laid. 2) since harry potter kiddie fantasy has taken on a darker twist. there are all kinds of psuedo-occult/fantasy novels available for the younger set these days. apparently if you don't have some sort of paranormal power, you're not in."

(since they are many he had no lack of choices the entire time i was there.) the highlight of the trip was my trying to lighten the mood at the dinner table and getting called a cunt for my efforts. it was reapeatedly thrown in my face that not choosing to live in alabama/ having preferences or a will of my own qualified me for such a label. i wasted two days of my thanksgiving break driving down there and one on the actual holiday itself. i'm sure my relief at finally escaping as i pulled out of the driveway was lost on no one. but of course they made it a point to invite me back for christmas. if i actually end up having to go there will be much weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth on my part. 
when i got home yesterday i was actually looking forward to the weekend since i was laboring under the assumption that i would be spending it in the company of friends. alas, that seems to have been too much to ask for. magan's mom is in for the weekend, i can't get ahold of katie and none of my other friends live in town. i was supposed to go to the leasing office today to finalize plans for moving in with a new roommate in january, but she never showed up. the most exciting thing i've done today is go to the grocery store and invent a new dessert -- which actually turned out to be quite good.

this has been a weird weekend. mariposa got sick, which ruined our normal routine. strangely, i was ok with that. guess i needed a break from 'normalcy', lol. i've been fighting a lot of ennuie lately. my life has definitely become predictable. Mon-Friday I do the nine-five thing, and then i spend Saturday and Sunday with Mariposa, cleaning and running errands. not a bad life, just filled with sameness. 

i want to work on my body. i took the last month off from swimming because i was depressed. talking to sylkweb last night made me realize that swimming has given me something i've never had before - a connection with my body. i never realized i how good it could feel to move. i always associated movement with shame and humiliation because my body didn't look or move the way other people's did. it just never occured to me that moving could feel pleasurable. the endorphasim i get after swimming is probably the only real physical pleasure i've ever had besides eating. being in the water makes me feel free and at home in my body in a way i've never known before. it makes me want to take care of myself. i guess i'm really glad my instincts/the universe conspired to keep me from giving up my gym membership despite the fact that i didn't use it for a month.

i actually also had my first tarot reading in a very long time last night. it was all about letting go of self-destructive patterns and learning to love myself. i realized as we were doing the reading that i don't even have a deck anymore. i threw them away when i moved into this apartment, and i had basically stopped using them a long time before that. my dog at the time chewed them and i felt i could't use them anymore because they were tainted, but i never botherd to replace them. its ironic because tarot has always been an important tool for me, allowing me to listen to my subconcious and get in touch with what i'm feeling about whats going on in my life. according to my reading last night i'm feeling very schizo and trapped in my head. which is true. i've been overanalyzing everyone and everything in my life, while trying to tell myself that i'm approaching life from a position of trust. in truth i wouldn't recognize trust if it bit me in the ass. i doubt everyone and everything including myself. 

there are many things i need to let go of. fortunately its a mercury retrograde - the perfect chance for me to practice being much more zen."

"event","some things in life have been really sucky lately. for instance, i was busily chowing down on some yummy cranberry-almond trail mix today at lunch when i encountered something hard and CRUNCHY. assuming it was a piece of organic almond shell that had failed to be winnowed out of my trail mix, i spat it out whilst mentally cursing my recent urge to visit whole foods market. (which is how i ended up eating trail mix for lunch in the first place.) i was, in fact, in mid-expletive when i noticed that something in my mouth ""felt funny"". after several minutes of avid exploring with my tongue i determined that i had indeed chipped a tooth.in the midst of  my silent freak out the bell rang and i had to return to class, where i could barely speak for being unable to resist obsessively examining my malformed tooth. two world history classes later, i was finally able to examine the damage in the privacy of my car. the good news was that it didn't hurt (just felt weird as hell) and was a tooth which had needed to come out anyway. *sigh* i am completely broke and have a chipped tooth. i feel soooo white trash. 

sucky incident number two: i had to call my father to borrow money this weekend. this may not sound so bad, but keep in mind that my father is unemployed (voluntarily -- hey, he's a hippie) and lives in a shack in allerbammy. he makes exactly 180$ per week from his unemployment checks. how does this man have more money than i do? our relationship has become strained because he's tired of bailing me out of financial crises. not that i can blame him.... until recently he's been extremely generous about taking care of my excess bills. learning how to live within my means sucks. money seems to flow through my hands like water. i seriously have some growing up to do. 

sucky incident number three: i'm still too paranoid to really talk about this one. lets just say that there is the POSSIBILITY that i was involved in a minor incident which could have been greatly exaggerated by the other party resulting in unpleasantness for all. all praise to the merciful goddess i think chipping my tooth might have been my karma for that one. enough said. 

sucky incident number four: i still don't play well with others. i've recently discovered (hey it was news to me if not to the rest of you) that i am very ""high maintenance"" when it comes to love affairs. sucks for me because its hard to find someone who wants to bask in my prescence on a daily basis. i like attention and i like taking care of people... my way. your way probably won't work, although i may be inclined to lie and say it does. *note* work on communication, honesty and control issues. 


i could go on, but i get tired of listing the icky things in my life. oh, ok, one more.. my driver's side power window will not roll down... that is a major bummer!! yup.... i'm done now. ok, back to the not-so-suckyness... i jsut finished reading the first book in a new vampire huntress series. the author is no laurell k. hamillton by any stretch of the imagination. so far i'm not all that impressed. i have an easy week at school because we are administering the PSAT to all ninth and tenth graders tommorrow. whoooohoo for two planning periods!! we are entering the Renaissance and Reconstruction in my two history classes. YAY!! i may actually finish the book after all :) hmmmm... i also have two VERY cute kitties who love their mommy... or at least being fed - i wonder if they'd really eat me if i died? anyhoo... off to bed.."

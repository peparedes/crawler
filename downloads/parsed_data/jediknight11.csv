i've needed new contacts for years now.  it isn't that the prescription changed much, it's just that the contacts themselves are so old.  gas permeable can last for years if you take really good care of them."

Brian helped me into bed an hour later, and i didn't wake up 'til after 9am.  i didn't sleep through the whole night.  i woke up a lot but at least was able to fall back asleep."

"event","i am so bored.  i've been meaning to post but have been blowing it off.  i think it's because, aside from the fact that i have a lot on my mind, i don't want to think about any of it because it's depressing and stressful.

in fact, i have a stupid canker sore, which hurts like hell.  i thought i was getting whatever cold Brian had last weekend, and when i didn't, then i knew it was from stress.  when i get real bad anxiety i start to feel sick to my stomach.  to me, that's better than developing stupid canker sores when i'm stressed.

at least there's only 1 and it doesn't hurt too badly.  as soon as i felt it coming, i tried to nip it in the bud with Zilactin, which helps, but it stings like crazy when you first apply it.  well, really it depends on how bad the sore is.  if you catch it early it doesn't hurt as much.  anyway, after a few seconds the Zilactin completely numbs the pain.  so when you eat, it won't hurt.

<lj-cut>my other symptoms of being totally stressed are:
<li>leaving the headlights on</li>
<li>locking my keys in the car</li>
fortunately, our new car has roadside assistance.  so they try to save money by making the headlights shut on their own after a certain amount of time.  also, if you leave the keys in the ignition, you won't be able to lock the door.  but sometimes i leave them on the seat by accident.

anyway, here are the things that are bothering me:
<li>being broke because of this or that unexpected expense.</li>
<li>whether or not i should get a job.</li>
<li>whether or not i'm ready to work--Cindy says that winter semester is still too early for me to go back to teaching.</li>
<li>whether or not my mom is serious about going to family therapy with me and Lesley.</li>
<li>whether or not <i>i'm</i> willing to go.  i just can't stand being around my mother.  not only do i not want to deal with her, i don't want to see her face or hear her voice.</li>
<li>scheduling holiday visits.</li>
<li>the pressure of giving presents, which we can't afford this year--or any year, really.  we end up applying for a new credit card to pay for gifts.</li>
<li>sending out Christmas cards, which i love to do, but like, last year i decided not to do them because i knew that i was too stressed.  Brian and i argued over it, so finally i was like, fine--you take care of it.  well, he didn't get around to it either.</li>
<li>my weight--how am i going to keep myself from scarfing down all the yummy stuff that Mom likes to bake?</li>
<li>my weight also makes me not want to see my mom because i don't need her criticism, i don't need to hear how much weight i've put on since she last saw me, how fat i am and what exercises i should do, like she does to Lesley.</li>

ugh.  now i feel sick after writing all this, which is part of the reason i've been avoiding it.  i'm good at avoidance.</lj-cut>"

"event","good and bad.  Saturday we were supposed to go to Downers Grove.  my LEGO builders club was having its monthly meeting.  i haven't even been to one yet and said i'd go.  we never made it.  we got into a fight about something--i can't even remember what.

i think we were pissy for the whole rest of the day.  later, Brian rented <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328107/""><i>Man on Fire</i></a>, which totally rocked and that i'd be willing to watch over and over.  and, we actually returned it on time.  o.O

today we had plans to attend an adoption event for Chicago Bully Breed Rescue, a group that rescues pit bulls, bulldogs, bull mastiffs--you know, bull-type breeds.  i thought it'd be a disaster because the binder we were supposed to receive on Friday never arrived.

actually, it did, but since i never answer the buzzer when i'm not expecting anyone, UPS just left a notice.  we didn't realize that the person from CBBR was going to send it via UPS.  then, it turns out that you can't pick stuff up from UPS on weekends.

the binder contains information about CBBR that we were supposed to set out for people.  because the rescue doesn't have its own facility, it's kind of hard to contact people.  this is the first time we've volunteered for them and all we had was the main number, which goes to a voice mail.  Brian couldn't reach anyone, but when we got to the PetSmart where the event took place, one of the volunteers had info left over from the Saturday event.

i felt overwhelmed at first because there were 6 puppies.  we were told there would be 3.  fortunately, there were 2 experienced volunteers there instead of just the 1 that we expected.  it was a lot of fun and i fell in love with a puppy that i got to name Lea.  i would have spelled it L-E-I-A, but i didn't make a fuss when Carolyn, one of the coordinators(?), thought to spell it L-E-A.

it was cool that i got to name her.  at TreeHouse they were so cliquish about who got to name the cats.  in all the time that i worked and volunteered there, i only got to name 1.  of course that isn't the point, but it makes you feel like you're part of the team.  anyway.

we were there from 11am - 3pm.  it started to drag during the last hour, and i didn't get enough sleep the night before.  it also reinforced to me that i prefer working with the dogs themselves, either in the clinic or just caring for them, rather than dealing with mobs of people at a retail place.  it was fun.  i'd probably do an adoption event again, but maybe only once a month.

i'm supposed to be walking 2 pit bulls:  Onyx and Mama, but i'm still waiting for Carolyn to let me know what the kennel's schedule is for the dogs.  all of the dogs stay at foster homes, some at kennels.  like i said, CBBR doesn't have its own place.

it was a whole lot of fun and the highlight of the weekend, definitely.  at first i was a bit reluctant because i'd have to miss JKD and kali today, but it was totally worth it.

i'll post an entry about it in <a href=""http://bloggochicago.blogs.com"">bloggo chicago</a> later today.  more pics at <a href=""http://www.gallerybloggo.com/bcgb"">photobloggo</a></lj-cut>

"event","i almost didn't go to my martial arts class--the thought briefly crossed my mind, but i went, and i'm glad.

Ken even thanked me for pointing out (though i did it unwittinly) a defensive move against the standing arm break, which i didn't even know i was using, and which he showed the rest of the class.  no wonder my partner Lisa, nor Ken, both of whom are taller and larger than me, were unable to make me tap out.  i couldn't at all feel their attempts to break my arm.

apparently, it only works if your opponent's thumb is facing upward.  when my partner wrapped and trapped my arm after i threw a purposely wide right cross, i twisted my fist so my thumb faced sideways (to the left).  so if anyone tries to break your arm, now you know what to do.  heehee.

class went over by about 15 minutes and i stayed another half hour practicing kali.  i'm not sure if i'll meet up with David and Sally tonight to practice some more.  i'm tired and sore."

"event","today i heard from Jonathan, a former professor i had in undergrad.  i was thinking about him yesterday because i haven't been in touch with him since like, July, when he provided me with an 8- to 10-hour paid research project of which i've only completed an hour.

i hadn't contacted him sooner because i didn't know how to broach the subject.  fortunately, he wasn't mad, but then again, he himself acknowledged today that i'm no longer one of his students.

part of me wasn't worried because i knew it'd be some time before he began writing the book.  in fact, i think he's still working on the proposal.  so he called to se if i'm still interested.  i am and i'm not.

in undergrad i helped compile the annual Keats/Shelley bibliography.  the work wasn't difficult, but working with <i>him</i> sometimes was, mainly because he had several students working on the project so things were sometmies disorganized.  the second year i worked on it i at least had an idea what to expect, though my responsibilities were greater.  hey, anything to look good on grad school applications, right?

i like compiling bibliographies.  and at the time, i was very much interested in the Romantics.  but then a grad course in Wordsworth and Coleridge ruined it all for me.

this current project has nothing to do with Romanticism.  (it's about Thomas Jefferson's poetry.  if that sounds unfamiliar, it's because it is.)  even if it did, i'm not sure how interested i'd be.  certainly it would look good on my c.v., especially because i haven't worked at all this year, so i don't know.

also, we're now colleagues other than the fact that i'm unemployed (though not unemploya<i>ble</i>).  it changes the dynamics of the work relationship to my advantage because he can no longer treat me like some little undergrad.  not that he did, really, because, i think, i was a non-trad student and not much younger than he is.  for example, when we talked about the work today, i detected a more respectful tone when he asked if i still want to do the research but that he'd understand if i was too busy.  plus, it isn't like i have to worry about a grade.

well, i do have all this other crap i'm dealing with, which is exactly why it ended up on the back burner in the first place.  i don't know.  i'm thinking no."

"event","i am totally fucking depressed.  had an appointment with the p-doc today, which is where i weigh myself.  no <i>way</i> would i own my own scale.  it fucking said 141.  the p-doc was like, you can take 3lbs. off for clothes, so it's really 138.  i was like, yeah, whatever.

granted, i <i>am</i> about to get my period, but still.  i don't understand how this can possibly happen when i've been going to martial arts regularly, eating healthy, and have cut down immensely on M&Ms.  perhaps i still eat too many, but Jesus Christ, i've gone from eating one of those big-ass bags a day to 2 or 3 king size.

i just don't get it.

"event","i feel like shit.  went to bed early for me last night, around 11pm because i was tired and cranky, but i still needed meds in order to actually fall asleep.  Brian gave me a trazodone (not sure how many mg), and i couldn't get up 'til 10am and then only barely.

the downside of trazodone is that i feel so groggy when i wake up, which makes it hard to get out of bed.

and i'm congested, which doesn't help because i'm having a hard time breathing, <i>and</i> my nose itches.  damn allergies.

"event","i told Brian, too.  in fact, after class yesterday i asked if David had time to stick around to practice kali for a while.  but it was 4pm and i figured Brian was already there because he was picking me up.

so David tells me to go check, and i did, and he was sitting in the waiting area in the front office.  Brian had never been all the way inside--just at the storefront--so i brought him upstairs so he could see the place, and to introduce him to David, who already knows that i'm married.

like, the first time he invited me on Thursday nights i made an excuse about having to pick Brian up from Union Station.  i mean, i don't <i>have</i> to, but sometimes i do, and i just wasn't sure about going back there a second time on the same day.  and David joked to make him take the bus.

when i showed up this past Thursday night, he was like, ""did you make him take the bus?""  i don't remember what i said--he was working late or something and taking a later train, which was true.  then he was like, ""did he ask who this David guy is?""  and i was like, ""uh, no.""

so yesterday, after i got dressed, i realized that the anorexic didn't even show up.  i ran back upstairs and stood by the doorway to the men's locker room and was like, ""David!  are you in there?""

he comes out and i told him that Cassandra didn't even show up.  he was like, ""who?""  and i'm like, ""you know--that anorexic chick you told us about.""

""oh, i thought you were here to take Jaime's class.""

""well, not really.""

then he pretended to cry and says, ""oh, i thought you were here to see me.""

ack!  i was like, ""see you tomorrow,"" because he was planning to come to JKD/kali today.

then <i>today,</i> i'm in JKD, which i've never been to before, and right after class started, i get paged to go to the front office.  i was like, wtf?  i go down there and Jaime tells me that David left a message for me that he wasn't going to make it to class today.

ok.  that is fucking weird.  why would he call just for that?

so i tell Jaime, and Aisha and Dorian, two of the girls who work there, ""i think he likes me.""

they laughed and Aisha says, ""he likes a lot of people.""

^_^; that was good to know!"

"event","yesterday i went to the Blend I class only because i wanted to see the 6ft., 98lb. supposedly anorexic chick that David told me, Ken, and Lisa about on Thursday.  when i called Lisa in the afternoon, she had forgotten about going to the class and wouldn't have made it in time because she was in the suburbs.

i went because i told the 3 of them that i would go, and David was teasing me about not showing up to practice kali on Thursday nights with him and Sally.

Ken said he would probably also go on Saturday to see if this Cassandra chick was for real.  he said that if he was there and wasn't already working on something, he would work with me.  anyway, i would have preferred that than actually going to class, but since i have some make-up classes to take anyway, i said that i'd plan on going to class.  and if he was there, then cool.

so yesterday rolls around, i still wanted to go but not attend class.  however, i didn't want to practice by myself because i feel awkward and self-conscious, especially because it's way more crowded on Saturdays.

Lisa didn't make it, obviously, and Ken didn't show up.  i waited around for David to see if he showed up; i figured maybe we could practice kali.  by 10 to 3, i didn't see him, and since i was already there, i decided to go to class.

i <i>thought</i> David said that he assisted in the Saturday Blend I class, but when i got there and asked Jaime if he'd seen David, he said he saw David earlier but didn't mention anything about him assisting, which was weird because Jaime's the one who teaches that class.  anyway, i saw David shortly before class started and he said that yeah, he assists Jaime on Saturdays.

let me tell you--Jaime's class was going to kill me, i swear.  i thought for sure that i would pass out, throw up, choke on my own vomit, and die right then and there.  well, not really.  but i did feel like i was going to die.  interestingly, and this is good i suppose, it didn't occur to me that i wouldn't make it through the entire hour.  but i admit that i was clockwatching and it was a very long hour.

we did a ton of stuff that we don't do in Ken's class:  50 jumping jacks, 30 or 50 crunches, 50 double crunches, 10 or 20 push-ups, 10 of the push-ups where your hands are twice the width of your shoulders apart, push-ups where your partner is on their hands and knees and your legs are propped up on their back, 25 squats, and then the thing where you're on the ground and hold onto your partner's ankles while lifting your legs for them to push down.  

we had to do these straight up and down, to the left, and to the right--20 times in each direction!  i was able to do 8 total, before i started to die.  i went from alternating directions to going straight up and down and was able to complete 20 of those.  i wanted to stop, but apparently, David was watching and maybe Jaime, too, because they started cheering me on.  i had no idea how the other students were doing, because i was trying so hard.  it was tough but i managed to do all 60.

the class went really fast because Jaime had us doing all these different things, like punching combos superquick, which we never do in Ken's class.  it took me a little while to get used to the coordination because i wasn't used to doing them that quickly.

i was relieved when it was all over, and it was a great workout, for sure.  i felt really, really good and psyched and stuff, probably from the endorphins.

i know that i'll lose weight a lot more quickly if i continue going to Jaime's class.  i have 4 more make-up classes, and i bet if i go to my regular Tuesday/Thursday classes <i>and</i> Jaime's for the next month, i'll lose at least 10lbs.  but then what happens after that?  my tuition only covers 2 Blend classes a week, and i'm not sure how much more a 3x/wk. membership costs, and i don't want to give up my weekday classes because i like Ken and the other students.

then again, those exercises and stuff we did, i can always do those at home, and for free.  so i'm not sure.  especially because i train in kali on Sundays, and today, i started training in jun fan/jeet kune do or whatever (JKD), which takes place right before kali and is taught by the same instructor.  well, i guess i don't have to decide today.

but get this--the anorexic chick wasn't even there!  >_<"

this morning i ran into him and he teased me about it, so i decided to show up and i'm really glad i did.  the extra workout felt good, and because there were only the 3 of us with as much time as we wanted to spend, David was able to correct a lot of my finer points.  i plan to make it a regular thing."

i didn't go on Tuesday even though i was all set.  i'm still learning to listen to my body, to try to figure out if i'm just being lazy or if i really am tired.

the insomnia is improving--i'm still taking Ativan, though sometimes, by 7 or 8pm i'm so sleepy that i have to lie down.  i'm trying to fight it, but it's hard.  also, i need to take the Ativan earlier.  at least i've been getting up around the same time every day (9ish) and getting more than just 5 hours of sleep.  i think.

the decaffeinated diet Coke has been a tremendous help, too.  i was skeptical about it at first, but it tastes exactly the same as regular diet Coke.

"event","wrote this last night, actually
<lj-cut text=""possible triggers"">watching the Bears game, feeling depressed.  excited to see Krenzel starting in his first NFL game and as a rookie.  he wasn't even expected to play at all this year.  he was like, 3rd on the depth chart.  it must be so, so exciting for him.  who knows?  this time last year he probabilities thought he would be in med school right now.

but obviously that isn't why i'm depressed. i'd say that i don't know why, but i do.  it's the weight i've put on recently.  i don't even have any pants that fit me.  not clean, anyway, and even then, i have maybe 3 pairs of cargos, 2 pairs of wind pants, and 2 pairs of sweatpants.  oh, and a pair of yoga pants.  i couldn't even go anywhere today because i don't have clean pants--i'm wearing shorts right now and i'm pretty sure it's too cold out for shorts.

i'm going shopping for clothes this week.  but i don't want to.  i don't want new clothes.

part of the reason i still haven't put my small clothes away is because i don't want to see how few clothes i have left.

Mom brought a ton of homemade stuff and i've been binging on these caramel brownies.  i just can't stop myself.  i'm not blaming her.  i mean, she doesn't even know.

i don't want to tell her because i don't want her to <i>not</i> bake the stuff she normally does at Christmas on account of me.  but i just have no willpower.  i feel so weak.

and i've missed martial arts 2 weeks in a row because of my insomnia.  i haven't even been to kail.  it makes me feel like a slug and a piece of shit.
----------
i cut.  i was on the phone with Brian, who was at the laundromat.  i took out my frustrations on him and he knew it, and i knew it, and i think he even knew that i knew but was letting me vent.  he kept asking me what he could do to help.  mainly we were talking about my weight.

he said we'd eat better, make sure to buy only light and fat-free food.  i blamed him for cooking everything in butter instead of oil, which he denied.  i said that the only reason he cooks in margarine is because i've been ordering the groceries.  and i was like, and all you cook is meat and potatoes stuff from Iowa.

i kept leading him in circles about the clothes thing.  he'd suggest that i get a few new things; i'd say i don't want anything new.

i said i'd rather die than be this fat.  i hate myself so much, my body.  i considered ODing again but Basil was sitting next to me so i felt bad for even thinking it.

i demanded he bring home diet pills.  he agreed.  then i figured they'd be bad for me so i suggested laxatives.  he didn't think that was a good idea because it's worse on your system.  then i changed my mind altogether and accused him of enabling me.  i'm not even sure what of.

he hung up on me, which made me mad so i called him back and yelled some more.  he hung up again.  i kept calling him back and he must have turned his phone off because i kept getting his voice mail.  so i got more and more upset and finally left a message threatening to cut.

and i did.  like last time, i couldn't do it as much or as badly as in the past.  then i just lay in bed and dozed on and off.  Basil stayed by my side the whole time.  in my mind i was hoping that Brian would just find me laying there.  i would have preferred it to be more dramatic by being out cold from Ativan or trazodone.

every time i think my stupid borderline behaviors are finally in check, they pop up like a hideous jack-in-the-box.  i know that i could benefit from a DBT program, but i just don't think we can afford it right now.

all i want from him is more of his attention, but i know he's suffering from depression, too.  i think that not having sex definitely adds to my frustration and my own insecurity, like he thinks i'm too fat or something, when really he's too depressed to even be interested in sex.  i just hate all of this so much.</lj-cut>

Brian offered to drop me off and go to a nearby coffee shop if he gets home in time.  maybe he'll come with me?  i'm not planning on staying the entire time, unless practice is only for an hour.

the beginning class starts the first Tuesday of every month, and goes for 4 weeks.  after that, you join the regular class and practice on Tuesday and Friday nights, and noon on Sunday.  in the summer they don't have Sunday practices.

the problem is that i have kali from 11am - noon on Sundays.  it's about 15 minutes away from kendo practice, and i'm not sure it would be acceptable to arrive late.

i'll have to check into that, because i don't want to give up kali.  there's a Thursday night kali class, but i'd have to pay $20 extra a month tuition.  also, i really like my kali instructor and a different person teaches on Thursday.  i know her and like her, but i've never taken her classes.  on the other hand, my current instructor teaches jun fan/JKD on Sundays at 10am and i'm planning to begin training in that.

anyway, i'm not sure we can afford the $60 dues for kendo.  at least the cost remains the same when you go 3x/week.  also, the sensei said that in 4 - 8mos., depending on your progress, they will help you order the kendo armor.  this runs about $600 - 800, but i've already decided that if i train in kendo, i'll sell my goalie eqipment, which is worth $4,000.  even if i only sell it for a fraction of that, i'll still make more than enough to cover the armor."

"event","my insomnia is getting much worse.  i don't even get sleepy, and it's so hard to force myself to go to bed when i'm not at all sleepy.  so annoying.

as a result, i missed my appointment with Cindy this morning--for the 4th time in a row:  3 last week, 1 today.  i plan to make our Friday appointment.

also, i woke up too late to make it to my martial arts class.  it's been a while since i missed a class--around the time my toe was healing.  i don't like the feeling of missing class at all, especially because i missed my kali class on Sunday for the exact same reason.

i have an order i need to ship today, and i haven't even taken a shower.  it's 2:30 pm.  i got up at 11:30am.  i feel like such a slug.

i saw Swami yesterday and he said that i'm doing really well except for the insomnia.  he's very concerned about that.  also, he suggested not taking Lexapro for 3 - 4 days.

also, i'm depressed (not clinically--more like bummed out) because i've gained 2lbs. in the last 3 weeks.  i get weighed in his office.  i don't understand how that's possible, especially because my binging has decreased these past couple of weeks, or at least it seems like it.

bleah.

"event","we had a really good talk on Sunday and the rest of the weekend was fine.  we've decided to find something to do together on weekends on a regular basis so we have some structure.  we're thinking of volunteering at a shelter to walk dogs.

Carol, Brian's therapist, suggested we see Cindy together this time around, maybe because Carol was our couples therapist 3 years ago.

i'm glad that we're able to resolve things now.  our time with Carol helped more than we realize."

"event","not having gone hiking, as i expected, was a bad idea.  sure, it's pretty cold out there, but...i don't know.  since then we've eaten lunch and watched part of the Ohio State vs. Iowa football game, which was pathetic on Ohio State's part so we turned it off.

we talked about going to a coffee shop and to Target to get some things, but who knows when, of <i>if</i> that'll even happen today.  around 4ish i suggested we get going once i saw him turn the TV to the channel that shows a plain blue screen with no sound.  that's the sign that he's falling asleep on the couch for the millionth weekend in a row.

but i was tired by then, too, and didn't even feel like going, but i was afraid he'd end up sleeping on the couch 'til 8pm.  this could still happen, of course.

i'm especially pissed because last night he said he'd scoop the litter boxes in the morning after running out to buy litter. why, oh <i>why</i> did i believe him?  to give him a ""chance""?  what-the-fuck-ever.

so this morning he said he'd scoop poops and put what's left in the smallest litter box in the other 2.  uh, that was at 10am.  i've mentioned it a couple of times today but he just blows it off.  now he's mad at me for bringing it up again.

he looked in the atlas earlier and suggested going to Lake Geneva tomorrow, which is fine.  he's never been there, but i have.  it's a nice town.  but you know what?  we're not going to go.  just like always, we'll make plans and not follow through.

i don't even want to be near him, but where the hell am <i>i</i> going to go?  like i said, i don't even feel like going out anymore; i no longer have the energy to get out the door to do stuff that i had this morning.

this fucking sucks.  and you know what, Brian?  when the hell are you even going to read this?  you said yourself that it's easier to discuss things sometimes in writing, and you insist that you keep up with my LJ.  yeah, right."

"event","i haven't dealt with this lately because learning how to live with a loved one with a mood disorder takes priority.  it <i>seems</i> like i haven't been binging on my peanut M&Ms lately, and yet i feel like i've gained weight.  in fact, i know i have.  my absolute favorite pair of pants that practically fell off unless i wore a belt--let's just say i don't have that problem anymore.

Brian and i were going to go hiking today out in McHenry county, but it's too cold and windy.  we may end up doing chores (bleah), and one of the things i need to do is box up the clothes that are too small.  i've been putting that off, although it'll be nice to have more room in my closet.

"event","i'm trying to be patient, but Brian has already irritated me today.  Fridays are my days to have the car because i see Cindy in the mornings.  well, i hit the snooze button and next thing i know, it's 10:30.  i only knew this because Brian was the one who woke me up.  obviously, he overslept, too.

this is the third appointment this week that i've been a no-show, and that's bad enough.  so Brian called in sick and said he'd be in the office this afternoon.  but by the time the next train leaves for Downers Grove, it would be too late.  needless to say, he wanted the car.

well, i already had plans for today, even though my first one was a blow.  i almost went to Graham Crackers yesterday to pick up the new <i>Streetfighter</i> and <i>Rurouni Kenshin</i> that have arrived for me.  (i have a club account, where you give them the titles you're interested in and soon as they come in they set a copy aside for you so you don't have to worry about missing an issue.)  i also need more boards because i ran out the other night when i finally got around to organizing all the new comics that i acquired recently.  i didn't go yesterday because i figured i'd go today after i saw Cindy, like i always do every Friday--go to GC, that is, after my appointment.

i was also planning to go to the post office to ship a LEGO order for a customer.  he said he could do it for me, but i don't even have the package ready.

i haven't been to Variety Comics in a while, either, and Rick the owner, i know, is looking for stuff for me.  also, i have some issues that he's willing to do an even trade with me for as soon as he gets stuff i'm looking for.

i had thought about going to Borders because i have 20% off coupons that expire on Monday.

sure, i could take public transportation if i really wanted to go to those places, but the point is, i thought i'd have the car.  if i took the bus/train, what would normally take me about 2, 2-1/2 hours would take me 4 and i doubt getting transfers would cover all my destinations.  i'd spend way less on gas going to all those places than i would on the CTA.

i know that Brian is struggling with his depression.  but now it's affecting my plans, and it's starting to really get to me.  i'm still trying to be patient, but when is enough enough?"

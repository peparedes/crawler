So Friday I went to Eboni's party <3 then i spent the night at Alexis's house! haha good times! 

Saturday I went to my dear Andi's house and we hung out wih Eddie <3, Robbie and Jerry. Haha we watched soccer for llike an hour. lol. When they left we rented movies and brought Andi's T.V. outside and watched Harold and Kumar go to whitecastle while we were in the hott tub! We went on a mid-night walk looking for these crzy people that were screming and we got lost! 

Today we woke up and went to Andi's little sister's soccer game. It was raining the wholeee time! then we came home and watched movies :]

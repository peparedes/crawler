"event","So Jamie wrote to me today and said BACK UP YOU LJ cause they might kill it......
so now i'm all sad.  Man there are a lot of memories in this old journal, even coversations with my long lost friend squidhead which will never ever be replaced, not by all the gold and jewles in the world.  I'm happy it's now all safely saved onto my hard drive....but now i'm wishing I had been writing all this time, over the past few years.  So many things have happened, so many things have changed and now i'm an old fart with a failing memory (ok, well not really).

So new years resolution number 34502409243098236-0  if LJ stays online, i will update more often.

And to all my dear old friends.  I miss you and love you.
If ever any of you want to contact me if LJ dies

"event","I've had the most lovely month ever i think.  So many nice things have happened.  To start with i performed in a show at mc gill university...a huge oriental dance event thrown by Elise Oasis where i danced with Ilhan Karabacak(Istanbul) -Ahmet Luleci and The Collage dance ensemble (Boston) - Tarik Sultan (NYC)-Dominique Favreau (MTL) -Elise(MTL) -Hannan Sultan (Toronto.  

Anyway I was blown away by how nice all the performers were and i managed to make a very unexpected friend.  Ilhan, who is residing in montreal a the moment has been giving classes and is interested in working with me...if he stays in the city.  He's so kind and helping me correct so many details in my dancing.  He's a great character as well, silly and serious all rolled into one

The other lovely thing is that we were both mentioned in the montreal gazette!

I made a little troupe with lovely girls who i adore.  we're calling ourselves Ethereal Tribal because every time i dance people tell me it is (other worldly, or they were transported to another world, and one woman even said my dancing is very ethereal.)  I also thought it was appropriate because the dance it's self is taken from dozens of other cultures but then mixed with our own perceptions of them since we do not experience them for ourselves, making it almost a make believe version of a historical dance.

Anyway this was our first show together.

ps. sorry they're blurry...we were moving lots and the camera's couldn't use flashes.

This show includes dinner and drinks and cost aprox $25 dollars per person including tax and wine and tip.

There is a Huge Line up for the evening.  Dancers include
Samia of the Menara, who is without par when it comes to charisma and pure oomph-energy, and is the prima dancer at the Menara.

Gabriela Mendez, Classic Egyptian Style, and in my opinion one of the most beautiful dancers ever.

Samantha Rajack from Toronto, 
Andrea Fryett performing a Gypsy, and possibly an American Tribal Style piece. 

And others."

All the stuff you see outside in the map are done by me...except the plants, they were donated by ubisoft, but i placed them all exactly as you see them.

Also inside the cave, my friend alex and i did together, we both took turns modeling and texturing it, and then lit the thing together.

Also last night was the year end party for school and i got to do a little four song bellydance show....ther were about 250 people there....i wasn't nervous at all and it was a whole lot of fun

Also i have a job officially, i was told a couple days ago.  They said they'll start me off on ninja turtles but i think they have it in mind to move me to concept art as soon as i can prove i'm fast enough at drawing...which means i will practice like crazy all next week.  Possibly things could change though in the near future, ubisoft likes to change it's mind five or six times a day....so well see."

"event","I had a dream about tony last night.  We were all at the pharm, it was just getting dark, and i was wandering around with a glow stick.  At some point i looked down and realized that i had the glowstick goo all over my foot.  Being a hypochondriac i started to freak out and found tony siting on a log.  I sat with him and told him my dilemma and asked if i needed to go to the hospital.  Tony just smiled at me and said ""andrea, you're so silly, you'll be fine"", and as he always did changed the subject to get my mind off of it, and we were just hanging out.  The whole thing was just so real,  my problem, the way he reacted, we went through those kinds of things all the time.  And he was just so vivid, i could see very detail, small imperfections in his skin, the hair on his legs between the bottom of his shorts and the tops of his socks, his posture.  Everything else in my dream was exaggerated, except for him, except for this moment.

I woke up crying....
haven't really been able to stop all day.
i feel like we made a new memory."

"event","When i was young i encountered the world of myst, a magical place of fantastic landscapes, dramatic lighting and breath taking atmosphere.  I thought to myself ""i wish one day i could make something this beautiful"".  Of course i figured only the best of the best of the best get to work on projects like that, thought i might have an easier time becoming a movie star or astronaut, so quickly gave up on that little dream.

Well today the company that brought us that game http://www.ubi.com/ENCA/ gave me a letter containing an offer of employment.  Imagine that after seven years i will be working on projects that i never imagined possible.  After seven years i have reached and surpassed that dream and can move on to bigger ones.  When i had my interview it seemed that possible in the future i may find a job in the concept art dept....This is what i will work on, making a living doing nothing but drawing, and all the while, being considered a professional in my field."

"event","I had a dream the other night that i walked onto a beautiful garden balcony.  All of my friends were there and we were having a party in memory of tony, we could feel his presence there even though we could not see him.  In the center of the garden was a beautiful marble sculpture of a life size girl.  As i was admiring it a women who had the same face as the girl in the sculpture aproached me.  She told me she was the girls sister and said she was going to bring her back to life.  She reached forward and put her hands on both sides of the sculptures head, as she did the stone turned to skin and the girl slumpted forward, looked up, and smiled.  I became so overwhelmed with emotion over the sculpture and especially over tony that i began to cry.  Someone mentioned that the girl in the sculpture was a witch and was killed during the witch trials, but witches didn't die that way they said, because they returned to nature and were thus imortal.  The sculpture put her hands on my back and began to draw all the pain out.  I could feel it passing through me so strongly that it woke me up.  When i woak i was sitting in bed crying.

And today i've been polishing old 3d work for my demo....
I textured that first character that i did months ago and built a little room for her.  The lighting and texturing is not really complete (it's still to dark and i need to adjust light colour), and dave will help me animate her doing a little fan dance this weekend.....But it give you an idea. Also she's open for critique.

"event","I had my surgery last friday.  I had a nasty allergic reaction to some of the drugs and developed a rash and puked for hours and hours even though i had an empty stomach for over 12 hour before my surgery.  Guess what i was puking....bile and anesthetic.  Normally with this surgery they send you home the same day, however i was too weak and stoned and sick so they kept me over night.

The gas stuff that they filled my abdomen with was by far the worst part.  It was so painful for about two days that i had to sleep sitting up in a chair and could barely breath, even on two codeine pills.

The surgery it's self apparently went really smoothly, the cysts (i had two in the same ovary) came out very easily.  The teratoma (mutated genetic matter one was easy to take out) and the other water filled one i believe they just pop.  Apparently between the two cysts my ovary was about the size of a golf ball. 
No wonder the nasty thing hurt.

I'm getting better now though, i still get tired quickly and my ovary still hurts a bit, but it's not so bad.  The incisions themselves were never a problem.

"event","I was sitting under a tree with some friends looking at a burnt old house.  Sitting on the front porch of the house was a young man wearing torn burned jeans, he was carving something with a pocket knife, and his left leg was leaning against the wall beside him with the foot up.  There were definitely strange things about him but he did not seem obviously dead to me.  He was much more fleshy and lucid than the other ghosts in my dreams.  My friends started to talk about him which pissed him off so he walked over and with a sweeping motion of his hand caused a force which made it impossible to breath for a few seconds.  My friends freaked out and ran but i was curious and begged him to stay to talk.  Finally he agreed by asking me if i knew how to dig and pointed to a spoon and a hole in the drive way.  He revealed that he and his girlfriend had been in the house when it burned, she had been trapped under a part of falling ceiling when they tried to get out, so the only part of her he could save was her head.  Which he buried in the driveway and which i was expected to dig up.  I was really nervous of the ghost at first but he was actually very nice, when he noticed i was afraid of him he threw a little snowball at me in a playful manner and then laughed.  He didn't say very much but i could tell he was lonely.  

I went back to digging up the head, finally got it out of the ground, wrapped it in some cloth and went to give it to him but i woke up."

"event","ZBrush is this weird 3d program where you can model things kind of like clay by using a mouse or even better yet, a wacom.
So what i did was to build the low poly version of the head in 3DSMAX, then imported it into ZBrush and went from there.  After you use this high poly ZBrush version to build something called a normal map which you apply to your low poly character.  Basically it makes it appear and react (to light for example) as if your character is super high poly...even though it's not.

It's kind of like cheating :P

"event","Christmas was lovely.  Dave and i made the long journey to ontario to spend time with my mommy and daddy.  It was a full house this year, lindsey and john were there, john's mom and dad also came for christmas dinner, and my nanny and poppa came from fort erie to visit for christmas as well.  I guess the family is expanding.....weird.

After christmas dave and i spent a couple of days at home and did some more painting.  The last tennants had this thing for colours and colour combinations that would make most people barf.  Floyd said they were probably colour blind circus clowns, i suspect he might be right. 

Then we went to quebec for new years to see daves family.  Time with his family is always quiet and nice, especially at his moms place.  His dad's side of the family like to joke around and shout like crazy old french people, which isn't surprising because that is what they are (and i mean that in the most loving way possible).  Before we left for quebec dave realized that he did not have a gift for his family, so we cheaped out and gave them a picture of us.  I thought this was a kind of narcissistic idea but it seemed to go over fairly well.  For your amusement this is the photo we gave them, laugh if you will :P

For new years we didn't have any plans so we ended up at this little bar called le temps partiel (my french spelling is worse than my english).  It was a very small crowd and a rather strange mix of really friendly people and really desperate people.  There was this kind of old chubby lady dressed in something that wasn't very flattering who kept dancing around.  She obviously wanted to get laid but her three male companions were obviously gay, so no luck there.  She was trying to pick up EVERYONE in the bar.  She would go up to men and just sort of turn around in this weird 3 1/4 angle view for them and kept looking at them and then her ass, trying to advertise it.  Man that was amusing.  Some of daves old friends work there as bar maids so they got us drunk for free all night.  Then i made out with one of daves ex's.  Cutest girl ever but reminded me a lot of myself at her age.  
Dave and i then proceeded to try to discuss all our relationship problems to see if we could come up with a way of fixing them.  I think we may have found a way that might work.  I hope so, aside from the problems that we have we are very well suited for each other, and i'm pretty sure with a little effort we can get over this.

also i'm only writing all this boring crap because i should be doing homework...so time to sign off me thinks."

For our final project at campus ubisoft we have the option to make a splinter cell game. We will form two teams and work on it.  This will be a fully functional game as we have modelers animators and programmers studying here.  They are doing this as an attempt to get us past an otherwise long and difficult adjustment period when we enter the work force.
This does not mean we HAVE to choose this option or we HAVE to work for ubi....but considering they told us today that basically anyone who wants a job there who study`s here will have one.  This is a HUGE relief and does a lot for my sense of motivation.  Not only do i know that all this WILL pay off in the end but i was basically already offered a job and will not have to hunt for one afterwards.

YAY for everyone in my school.

BUT, they were very impressed with my performance none the less.  The family is from egypt and one of the members said he just came back from there and i was better than any of the dancers he saw while he was there.  They seemed pretty surprised that i've only been dancing since like 2001. 

I'll try to post pictures later, if any of them are flattering.  Dance pictures, especially belly dance pictures are almost always horrible.  The movements are all so beautiful until you stop them and take them out of context.  But i'll see how they turn out.

These people were crazy too.  Both the wife and husband were engineers and the daughter and her husband were lawyers.  They had heated toilet seats i kid you not.  I should have charged more......
they were nice though and gave us tea and desert after.  They all wanted to ask question about dancing and stuff and i needed the time to rest so we stuck around.  Apparently years ago they had a dancer who didn't dance very much at all and instead tried to get everyone else to dance.  She went so far as to put a veil over some guys head.  Man that kind of invasion of personal space is not cool.

"event","If anyone is free to give me a little ride from my old apartment to my new apartment with some of my stuff (namely my fish aquarium and turtle aquariums) as well as a few boxes on thursday or friday at any time i will LOVE you FOREVER and buy you a dinner, lunch, or something of the like in return.  There will also be a lovely invite to our house warming party in a few weeks with booze included.  

(oh except i teach a dance class friday at 7:30 so it can't be then)

This is a one time only limited offer so sound really enthusiastic asap or you will really regret missing out on this fabulous opportunity."

"event","I taught my dance class today and everyone looked fucking bored.  
they were all complaining last time that i went TOOO FAST.  So i slowed it down and repeated several moves over and over hoping they would get it.


But they looked BORED.  one girl started looking out the open window, some girl with an attitude left early with her friends, and evertime i shimmied a girl in the front would make a discusted ""i can't do that, you can't expect me to do that"" face.  

I HOPE it's better tomorrow"

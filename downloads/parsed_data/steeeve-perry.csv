"event","So today i was reading a friends post and the comments regarding that same entry. He said he was sorry for the things he has done. I dont doubt it for a second. It also got me to thinking, actually sitting down and thinking, about what happened and what it did to people. This is where my thought process took me.

Dennis: You really had nothing to do with the bid issue but I do feel terrible about how the moving out process was handled. I know it was a kick to the face and im sorry. we really should start hangin out. Feel free to stop by whenever. Theres always a party at Club Tangle!

David: I owe you the biggest apology. As much as you may like to think that im proud of what I have done your very wrong. I considerd you my best friend for years...since 6th grade. I trusted you with everything (except my car) and I know you trusted me and boy did I mess that one up. You and Dennis were my family even before we moved in together. Thats what sucks about this more than anything. On the other hand David, im pissed that you heard one side of the story and decided that must be how it happened. I'll be honest with you, when Dennis told me and Sean what the story was we both had a pretty good laugh.

Maris: Where to begin? Ill start with a response to your comment. In no way did I have an agenda. Did I let the alcohol and my pants effect my judgment? Sadly yes. I never planned for anything, never had some goal to achieve. You on the other hand have a very serious problem when it comes to being faithful. 
---Heres what i know of your relationships and what happened to them: ADAM(HUSBAND)Cheats on husband with a student of yours(DAVID). DAVID(BOYFRIEND)Cheats on boyfriend with boyfriends roomate and friend(SEAN) until he no longer has text messaging not because she felt bad. DAVID(BOYFRIEND) Came close to cheating on boyfriend with other friend and roomate(ME)---
The only reason you even opened your mouth to David was because you found out that me and Sean new about the others involvement with you. Just like you never said a peep to your husband until you got fired because of your relationship with David. So you pretty much had to tell him. Grow up Maris. Thats saying a lot when the guy who steals bird baths and throws trash at mailboxes tells YOU to grow up.

"event","So its been over two months since my last entry. A lot has changed. I now live in Tanglewood, in a Duplex. To my surprise it is much better than the other house. The cops never come over. The cable is free. We actually had a neoghbor come over and welcome us to the neighborhood. Oh and rents cheaper. I got my old job back. I lost a couple friends but in the process i madee more than I lost. I found out that a girl cant have too much drama and that same girls love to mess around while watching Snatch, how perfect is that. Im going back to college over the summer. This time around should be better because I finally have a good idea what i want to do in the future.

Im taking a break from school for a semester mostly because I really needed a break before hitting college.

House things are going finr. the house is a mess though, mostly due Dennis. We haven't had any complaints from neighbors in a very long time. David and Myself managed to find a way on top of a building down the road. it is the best place for launching frozen water baloons.

I have been job less for three weeks now and things are getting real boring real fast...I need a job.

Kat is driveing me nuts and she is way too attached.

I need a break from this place for awhile though.  think when I get a job and save up some money and take a nice drive to the dirty south capital ATL...Wooodie wooo!!!

I haven't told my parents yet I dan't plan on going back. I lost my job because my boss had a bad day and was cranky. Someone upstairs likes me though because soon after I got fired the septic tank release valve blew piss and shit all over my boss. Take that bitch. I had to shave off my mohawk so as to get another job. Lately I have been breaking the law and because of this I really think I will become a cop, because as a cop I can breakthe law evenmore and no one will suspect it is me."

Apparently Dennis has matured so fast that he has become all of our fathers. Exactly what i was trying to get away from. He also has mastered the ability to know what you've done and said.....better than you...wow! HE IS AMAZING!

Neighbors are douches, and David is putting himself into a position where he will probably get hurt again. The worst thing about it is, he knows it.

Shawna is a time-bomb, you just dont know when she will go off. 
I recently came in contact with $900, which will all be wasted on fixing my car most likely.

But David has had himself locked in his room being anti-social as well as a harm to himself. He  seems a little better now. Dennis has been a reel ass about things pretty much this entire time. I expects shawna to do the ""womanly duties"" that is cook and clean. And he will do the ""manly duties"" like take out the trash...and ...take out the trash. To be honest I really think he wants shawna out BAD! He has already started talks about getting rid of shawna if she falls short on rent this coming month. Well he hasn't even talked to shawna in person about her money situation so he doesnt really have a clue. Besisdes... ic ould have sworn we had an emergency fund which would help someone if they were short and they would pay back later. 

Everybody in the house has an issue with something and no one is willing to get the entire group together and talk with everyone present. 

On the other hand its still been fun. We already pissed of the ""Neighborhood Watch"" when really is just the next door neighbor. She says we are too loud but that shit. We just park partially in her yard and launch apples and fake-blood balloons out our backyard. That right...I bought a water balloon sling shot.

We decided to open the doors going 95 mph to see how the ground would look, but David did have the balls to touch a moving semi when I got up next to it. Then we through our cups from the Lil' Champ Out of the car. Apparently my cup holder didn't let go of my drink because I am missing it. David cought me up on some ""hardcore lingo"" what a bunch of m00r0ns.

I talked to David a little bit about him going to Cali. And after are discussion I have come to realize his choice is still retarded. Why would anyone go to California to visit and stay with, someone whom you have known for merely 2 months, and thats only by IM and the occasional phone call, as well as assume that this person is just how they put of online.(because people never portray themselves differently online as to what they really are in real life...ofcourse not!) God only knows if she will even show to pick him up from the airport, what if her parents decide they don't want some stranger their daughter met on the internet from across the country to live in their house for a week or more. OH! but wait she has already let some guy from Chicago she also met online stay with her for a week(Internet Hussy) If David is so set on getting a car and moving to gainsville, it would make more sense to me to pay off his debt for his accident rather than save up for his trip to Cali. Because you know Roundtrip tickets to LA, California are not at all expensive during spring break. Dont get me wrong California is awesome atleast most parts are, and it can be a lot of fun, but there are just tomant ""what ifs"" for him to even consider it. But hey as much i know its a bad move its his money so he can throw it away how ever he wants to!

"event","Im finally starting my project for economics, bout damn fucking time! It's due Friday. Today is 49 cent hamburger day that rocks. I think the Pizza bag I stole from work and am now using as my back pack is growing mold, but what can you do ya know. I think I am failing my Cooking class, how bad is that. I think the only thing you need to know how to cook is Ramen and Easy-Mac because thats all you need to survive. me and David want to tee pee a house, anyone know a good strong toilet paper for the job...I dont want to do a shitty job.(Pun)"

"event","I dont understand why my friends cant stay in town for at least another year longer than planned. I think David might be willing to stay a year eventhough he wants outta hear this summer. He is waiting for Dennis but they arent willing to wait for me. Dennis would be over in Gainsville over this summer had Lucy pursuaded Dennis to go to College (not that him going to college is a bad thing) but that goes against his original plans for moving to gainsville this summer. My plans have also changed but NO they cant wait me. I would do it for them. Shame on me I guess. Got to go now to Davids to watch fight club now! I guess theres one good thing to be happy about(Fight Club)"

"event","I ate toooo much chocolate. I am dying my hair white today, if it all works out ok and doesnt turn to shit. I just read the newspaper and I found out Elvis is coming to town. He plays Wed. the same night(and time) modest mouse is playing. When I say Elvis I mean the good one, not the one whos leg moved like it was having a sesure and lip more distorted then Billy Idol, no fuvk that Elvis. Costello is the good one. Tickets are too high, that makes me sad."

"event","Valentines Day=Empty wallet...hooray. I spent 70 dollars alone on chocolate, which I don't even get to eat. Luckily I didn't have to pay for the roses... I got them from Dillards they were complimentary(after a fifty dollar perfume purchase)... details. I ended up kinda pissed, because Kat was unable to take off of work, so the wonderful night I had planned for her went to shit. No use crying over spilt milk. Besides I have had worse before, like Kat's birthday where her father refused to let her go out and made me wait at the end of her drive-way to give her my gifts...that Dick. I heard Modest Mouse on the radio today on Forbidden planet it kicked ass. It was from there new album. Today for Valentines  Kat gave me two tickets to AFI. She hit on the old guy at FYE to get them because they were sold out. To be honest its a great gift and all but it didn't bother much that I couldn't go originally. She said the other ticket was for a friend so I'll take my baby David if he still wants to go."

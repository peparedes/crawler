How could you know just what you did?
So full of faith yet so full of doubt I ask.
Time and time again you said don't be afraid.
""If you believe you can do it.""
The only voice I want to hear is yours.
And again.
I shall ask you this once again.
And again.
He said:
"" I am but one small instrument.""
Do you remember that?
So here I am above palm trees so straight and tall.
You are smaller, getting smaller.
But I still see you.

I realize I hadn't updated this thing in months, thought I might write something, but its funny, I can't think of anything I want to write. I'm really excited about the Summer, no matter how how or uncomfortably humid it is, I've always had more of a problem with the winter then the summer. What's easier, getting warm or getting cold?

Well, I'm alive. Watch hello simon (www.hellosimon.com)...thats really it."

"event","The Cihan News Agency of Istanbul covered a story this weekend about a crowd that gathered to argue against allegations of the Armenian Genocide with the ""intention of remembering the mass killings of Azerbaijanis in Karabagh.""

Clearly there is a large story here dealing with Azerbaijan, Armenia, and a piece of land known as Nagorno-Karabagh. The hostility dates back to times of the Soviet Union, where borders were drawn as the USSR saw fit. When the USSR fell, this piece of land immediately became a war zone, currently, Karabagh is an unrecognized independent nation, with clear close ties to Armenia, since most of its population is (and historically has been) Armenian.

In this article, it reports that the crowds chanted ""Karabagh will belong to the Turks, and it will be a graveyard for the Armenians.""

Hold on a minute...

If you are:
A) Condeming an alleged Azeri Genocide perpetrated by the Armenians....
B) Condeming the recognition of an Armenian Genocide perpetrated by the Turks...

Then how does your situation look when you condemn the entire Armenian population of Karabagh to their deaths? Coincidentally, that sounds like another Genocide in itself.

I wrote a paper discussing the Nagorno-Karabagh Conflict a few years ago, and if you are interested in learning more about the subject, let me know and I'll provide you the information. But, I just felt mentioning this humorous observation."

"event","<b><i>Booth</b></i> is screening at the Longbaugh Film Festival in Portland, OR thanks to Film Baby.com. Its sorta funny because we've never really sold anything off of Film Baby, Conor submitted it just so it be out there. Film Baby has a featured showcase at the festival, and out of no where, they selected our film out of all the short films on Film Baby.com to screen before their feature length screening.

Either way, I'm psyched and I want to go out there.

"event","It has been quite a long time since my last ""blog,"" much has happened since then. The Holiday's came and went, and I got a full time job, working in Marketing. It's not bad, its fun, and it pays the bills.

The Departed I hear is half way along, and ""Stiffs,"" is the latest feature in town, starring Danny Aiello and apparently shooting many scenes in Watertown, though the film takes place in the North End.

I'm working on some big things with Conor Timmis, nothing that I can talk about openly, as the subject is quite confidential, but I assure you, it will be awesome.

Three Intolerances, a short I shot a few months ago will be done in a month or so.

Other then that, Chrissy and I are great! The job is great! Besides the cold, life is good."

"event","I'm sitting here listening to Jimmy Eat World's CD ""Clarity,"" a CD I've probably mentioned prior as being my all-time favorite album ever. I am ashamed to admit that I actually never owned the CD, and of course, Chrissy being the all-time best girlfriend, purchased it for my birthday.

It was a good birthday party, it turned into a mini-reunion among my friends, old and new! Nayad and Jeff came, and friends from school, Ben, Jason, Bri, Andy, Gregg, and Regina. We met at my house, then walked over to Not Your Average Joe's (which turned out to be much better then I thought it would be).

We hung out at my place for a bit, and then we called it a night. Thank you for everyone who came, and thank you Chrissy for being the best and coming up with the idea of getting everyone together."

"event","Random food for though, the oldest woman to have ever lived was Jean Calment, who died at the young age of 122.5, meaning she was born in 1875. Now follow me here in a brief list of things she witnessed:

-The creation and evolution of a new art form - film from no sound, to sound, to color.
-Horse and buggy to motor carriage to cars with air condition and cruise control.
-An idea that flying like a bird would be cool, crude WWI air planes, WWII fighter planes, jet engine, rocket engine, nuclear bomb - landing on the moon. Just think about how fast we were in space, FIFTY years, that in itself is mindboggling.

Imagine what we'll see in our lifetime, the only lame thing I can think of is Pong to Doom to Halo. Let's make this a discussion, what have YOU seen in our lifetime that you think people will look back and go, wow. I think a cure for AIDS/Cancer will be amazing.

"event","I have been vindicated from Best Buy, after all the troubles, which I failed to summarize in this blog (and don't care to talk about in detail), my computer was fixed, and I got a complimentary DVD and store credit, as well as an apology from the store and the corporate office.

So the lesson here, be careful, and don't take anything Best Buy says to heart, they don't always know what their talking about, and some even lie.

I hate liars. Especially ones that like about where your computer is at that very moment...in my case, when it was said to be at the service center, when actually, it was still in the backroom (for almost three weeks.)

"event","I'm very happy with Netflix and I can't believe I lived so long without it. Every single movie I could ever want (almost) is on Netflix, and they have a fast turn around time. Blockbuster is a thing of the past, the market changed, and flew right by them.

I saw The Bicycle Thief this weekend finally and I loved it, there's a bunch of movies on Marty's documentary ""My Voyage to Italy,"" that I'm dying to see, half you can't even find on DVD. The whole first half of the documentary they talk about all these films by Rossellini, one of them I really wanted to see, Paisan, but Netflix does not have it.

Chrissy Liscombe moved back to Fitchburg for Orientation this weekend. It is so weird not doing it for once. The whole timeline of things is messed up, you get used to School two semesters, then summer vacation. Now, I'm on track to work for the rest of my life.

Jason and Gregg are going on internship, Andy is moving to Brookline, and Ben is up in Fitchburgb. I've been trying to make it out to Ben and Ashlie but it has just been the craziest Summer ever.

Good times ahead.

The diagnosis was that my hard drive was sufferring from bad sectors, and it was losing data. Requiring the hard drive to be completely replaced, as well as the LCD for dead pixels. Seeing as though my Toshiba laptop already had the entire cover replaced due to lack of grounding, as well as the motherboard. There isn't much left on the computer left to replace, save for the keys.

Well, either way. My computer isn't ready yet, and I'm gonna lose it.

It was so weird watching stuff I hadn't watched in such a long time. Nayad was interviewed for A Look Through Our Eyes which she'd never seen before, so I was glad she finally got to watch it.

It was a good time, Chrissy got me some house warming presents! A towel dispenser, a little dishwashin soap thingie, and a really sweet picture of us!

Friday after work I went up to Framingham to meet Chrissy's grandmother who is up visiting from Florida. She was a very nice lady and I had a very good time!

The editors are back tomorrow, so I'm psyched about that, and the movie moves back completely on Tuesday. The future is still up in the air, but its slowly becoming a little bit clearer, for once.

Man Could Not Remove Lock For Two Weeks


BRENTWOOD, N.H. -- Emergency workers helped a New Hampshire man out of a difficult situation over the weekend after a friend apparently locked a padlock around his testicles.

According to the Portsmouth Herald, police reported that the 39-year-old man was intoxicated when they arrived at the scene on July 30 at about 3:40 a.m. The man, who was not identified, told them that he had the padlock around his testicles for two weeks.

The man said that a friend put the lock on while he was drunk and passed out. When he woke up, the friend was gone.

""Never in my 13 years have I seen anything like this,"" Cpl. H.D. Wood told the Herald.

The man told police that he tried to remove the lock with a hacksaw because the key had broken off in the lock.

He was taken to Exeter Hospital, where a locksmith removed the padlock. He was treated and released, and the hospital said he had no lasting injury.

Police said that they did not know the motive for the incident.

CML and I went for some fun in Boston today given our canceled beach outing thanks to some raw sewage being dumped in the ocean. But the day was not lost! We went down to the Maparium at the Christian Science center, which if you've never been is quite neat, but I'm not sure if the price of admission (No conversion required, just $4 with your student ID) is quite worth it, but its definitely pretty cool. The echo in this glass map room is crazy!

Our next stop was Fanuel Hall, where we witnessed various jugglers mid-act, a crazy woman frozen (who kissed Chrissy's hand after I made her give the lady a quarter), and some other random things. I love whats become of the waterfront now that I-93 doesn't rush over head. We walked over and admired the North End.

Chrissy's 25 cents made it possible for me to fulfill a lifelong dream. To use the Public Toilet in front of the Boston Public Library. These fancy devices clean themselves! As soon as you exit, it fills with water like a dishwasher and gives everything a clean! It's amazing. 25 cents buys you 25 minutes in a nice futuristic bathroom, and with MOOD music. It is in my humble opinion that one of these works of art stand on every street corner in every major city across the globe. New York had them briefly, but they disappeared, I'm not quite sure why.

Good times Chrissy Liscombe, thanks (for the day, not just to witness me using the futuristic toilet)!!

There are only so many 80 hour weeks you can take right? So the production office is open for another week as we wrap out, and then we're on a two week skeleton crew, which means I'm gonna help out at Extech during that downtime, and develop this new project I'll be shooting in a few weeks, and I'm gonna focus on submissions for <b><i>Booth</b></i>. <b><i>The Departed</b></i> will return in just four weeks.

I met up with Chrissy Liscombe yesterday after a real painful two hours at Extech fixing my messed up computer.  We went on an adventure to Nahant Beach, we used to go to Revere/Nahant a lot when we were younger, we'd have a little picnic in Nahant and go swimming in the ocean, a little of that came back, simpler, funner times. We had fun though, we wrote in the sand, I splashed Chrissy pretty good, then she got us a Ninja Turtle Ice Cream bar, which I enjoyably ate off the sand since mine fell, I still got the gumball eyes though.

After we went to the Galleria Mall, had an appetizer at Cheesecake Factory (officially my favorite restuarant), and then I bought a present for my house, a new crazy digital coffee machine since our old one broke.

Then, I waved goodbye to Chrissy Liscombe, and fell asleep in my bed, sleeping in, officially, with nothing hanging over me. I woke up, nice and early, watched a movie, then played Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas till 5:45pm. Yes, I didn't move once, maybe once to take a shower and get water. I feel relaxed...chillaxed even. Now to finish my night, I pop in <b><i>The Red Shoes</b></i> by Michael Powell, then Family Guy, and that'll be the end of a great weekend.

I had a good weekend. Saturday was finally my graduation party. We had it at the Chateau, a nice family Italian restaurant in Waltham. Everyone showed up, including Chrissy Liscombe! It was quite fun, I enjoyed my Chicken Parm.

Things are good at the Production Office, they wrap this leg in Boston by Friday. They move back to New York City for the next three weeks, and then are returning to wrap up here in Boston at the end of August.

MacWorld is this week, Jeff and I got our exhibition passes, so hopefully we'll be able to go down and get free things...I enjoy free things, like I need more clutter/junk in my room.

"event","Things have been quite busy here at the office for <b><i>The Departed</b></i>. The sheer size and scale for this film is obviously nothing I've ever seen. A $100 million dollar production under what is arguably one of the greatest living directors I've ever seen is expected to be a bit streamlined and exciting. You never realize how many people actually work on a film, Scorsese is just the center of it, above the line, so much so that he doesn't even need to come in and tell people what to do. A far cry from <b><i>Booth</b></i>, where I was tearing and fixing costumes, ordering and getting lunch, and directing. Here, I'm in charge of lunch, I cover the phones, I manage the craft services table in the office, and basically observe all the exciting things in the office.

The other exciting part of this job is to know how many fanboys and geeks there are out there who are dying to know what the movie is about, how its coming along, and who is in it. The temptation to leak information is huge, but I won't, just because its a comforting feeling to know that I know more then geek god Mr. Harry Knowles of Ain't it Cool News.com. Call me power hungry, but its nice.

I feel bad that I read the script, and that I know the ending, but I can tell you this one thing fanboy, it's gonna be a great flick, with a great cast.

One depressing epiphany in the past two weeks is the fact that most people seem to have forgotten the actual goal of what we do here, which is to make a movie. People forget why they got into this game rather then taking a real job, like a lawyer, or accountant. We are here simply stated, to make movies. Money is important, but the ultimate goal to be achieved is to provide quality entertainment.

<b><i>Star Wars: Episode III</b></i>, not a bad effort this time around Mr. George Lucas, my only criticism of your film (though it was on HD, only projected on film) is the bad melodramatic dialog between Padme and Anakin. Watching the film was like watching an accident happen, watching Anankin Skywalker essentially selling his soul to the devil sent chills down my back. Any of the melodrama that caused me to shake my head in disgust can be forgiven. Watching this movie triggered many of my memories of Star Wars, and wondering how Darth Vader came to be. It was a good movie, I'll give it that. 

I still need to see <b><i>Kingdom of Heaven</b></i>, then next week <b><i>Cinderella Man</b></i>. I love going to the movies.

Brenden Fraser. We made eye contact, he smiled, and slowly crossed the street.

The interview with Bigel Entertainment went smoothly, though relaxed, they were a small group, with a bunch of bigger budgeted films going into production in the next few months. Meaning I'd also be working in their production office come July. 

WideAwake, Inc. was interesting, it literarlly is run out of the guys guest house, they gave me homework. I had to watch ""The Girl Next Door,"" to get a sense of the directors style, then read then write coverage of a script they gave me.

The breakdown:

WideAwake, Inc: Based in West Hollywood, it is the production shingle of Luke Greenfield, director of ""The Girl Next Door,"" a new, small company based at the directors house.

Bigel Entertainment: Based in Beverly Hills on Wilshire Blvd, this is the company founded by Daniel Bigel, producer of ""Empire"" and ""Black and White."" All originally New York based people, they moved out here in November, opening their offices in December. I thank my Uncle for this hook-up.

Rat Entertainment: Production shingle of Brett Ratner, director of Rush Hour and Red Dragon, this one seems to be only looking for a part-time, but its worth the interview.

So, hopefully I'll hear back from a few more places I've contacted. Today is a MUCH better day. I met the brother-in-law of a girl from Extech, his company is NLE Systems, selling Avid and Pinnacle systems to post-production houses. Nice guy, and forwarded my resume to a few more places.

I went to Le Frite with Luca yesterday, a nice French restaurant his girlfriend works at, its not bad, and right around the corner from my Uncle.

We saw much of New York, I took them to a museum, the Tribeca Street Fair for the film festival, and the WTC site, it was fun, and we walked quite a darn bit.

When I planned this trip I didn't realize that it could be the last big even Jeff, Razmig and I go to together, things have been set in motion with internship that may mean I won't be in MA for the summer, or for the next year! At least things are moving on that front.

I had a good time with Jeff and Razmig though! Now, it is now American Dad time!

Oh and best surprise of the weekend? Some Starbucks with Chrissy!"

"event","The caution sign was missing when I slipped on that wooden dock along the Charles, I fell flat on my back, just a feet or so short of the edge of the dock. If I had been running full blast I would've most certainly slipped into the river, Chrissy would've pulled me up and I third arm would have materialized. What can I say, the Charles is clean, but not that clean.

<b><i>The Interpreter</b></i> was such an enjoyable flick, I really enjoy political drama a la Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series. (even the last one with Ben Affleck was ok) <b><i>The Interpreter</b></i> was Tom Clancy with a dash of Hitchcock, and it made for a really good time. Sean Penn, who for some reason bothers me occasionally, was excellent, as well as Nicole Kidman, despite my respect down low since the trailer for Bewitched came before <b><i>The Interpreter</b></i>. I was reading on IMDB about Christopher Walken, that he rarely turns down an acting job, because even bad movies are an experience, (i.e. <b><i>The Rundown</b></i>. Either Nicole was a fan of Bewitched and wanted to be in an homage, or was tied to it due to some studio contract, or she needs to fire her agents.

Chrissy and I had fun per usual though! I enjoy warm rainy days, I kept looking outside in the morning and expecting it to be cold, but it was fairly warm, and in the evening it got to be really humid and cool, which I must say I really enjoyed. Until I fell on my butt at the dock.

Finished up this composite for Paul, going up to Fitchburg in just a moment, and I'm psyched, new Family Guy T-minus one week!"

"event","I've been listening to my new CDs via Jason at work lately, I figure why not be productive for myself while strapped to a desk making countless web updates, videos, and printing datasheets. I like some of these new albums, <b><i>The Bravery</b></i> is good, <b><i>Hot Hot Heat</b></i> is really good, <b><i>Robbers on High Street</b></i> aren't too bad, not worthy to be copied onto the iPod. However, this new CD by <b><i>Of Montreal</b></i> is excellent!

Visions is coming up, which I must say I'm pretty excited about, though I'm a little worried about <b><i>Chelsea</b></i>, hopefully it'll be ready to shine. I've been trying to track down a DigiBeta deck to make a master of <b><i>Booth</b></i>, its something we'll definitely need to make pristine dubs, as well as screening at festivals (provided we get in). So far I got a guy to give us 10% off of their $525 day rate, which is a little out of our price range. One drawback to being out of school is the fact that my main man on this project now Gregg is busy out there, and I can never track him down to talk to him about any of these things, but he's still an amazing help. And Chrissy too, for getting the releases to Gregg, AND his hard drive when I needed it down here.

How about this weather? Jeff and I have made a committment to ride our bikes at least once a day every week, hopefully we can do it tonight and it doesn't rain. Stupid rain. At least its not cold rain. I hate cold rain."

"event","<b><i>Arrested Development</b></i>, call me a late bloomer, but I'm finally getting into this show. Great writing, especially great editing, their comic timing is amazing. I don't know if humor is something I myself would be able to tackle, but in my opinion, it is so much harder to be funny then it is to be dramatic. Well, maybe that's just me. FOX had better not cancel this show, but they aren't known for their wise choices.

I've been putting in some weekend hours at work to catch up on my video a week deadline, which hasn't given me much of a weekend, or much of a time to enjoy the nice weather, but I'm hoping to be out of here soon, just so I can enjoy the remainder of the day.

Watched some Goodfellas and had some wine on Friday night, Chrissy hadn't seen it before and she liked it, I really enjoy showing people good movies that they haven't seen before. Ben showed me Goodfellas, I think it was sophomore year. Scorsese at his best, the epic urban gangster tales."

"event","Four hours and twenty minutes on the Greyhound to New York City, and it couldn't have been more on time, exactly 4:20pm. I met up with Court at his work on 57th Street, then we met Dan at 59th. We went to this choreography/performance/club thing, but then decided not to go in, just because we didn't really want to pay $20 bucks.

It wasn't until ten past midnight when I got the call from Ray Ray about Law & Order, my call time was 1PM, somewhere between 155th and 152nd, on Frederick Douglas Boulevard. I was to report to the Honey wagon (Naively, I was not sure what this was), and look for either Ray or Jeff to start paperwork. I took the C train Uptown to 155th, but I should have taken the B, it would've been much closer. I got out at 155th and St. Nicholas Ave, and COULD not find the freaking location. I walked everywhere for about 20 minutes, finally I took a guess and crossed the longest bridge known to man, and saw under the bridge, grip and electric trucks.

I found the Honey wagon, basically a portable production office/trailer, also where the restrooms are. I met a cool kid named Red, showed me some of the ropes, Jeff got me a walkie. Off I went up to the restaurant location, it was messed up because I was just kinda thrown into it all, picking up things as I went along. Duties included blocking pedestrians, calling out cues, bringing the director water, hanging out call sheets and the end of the night.

Sean came down to the set and was nice enough to grab me some coffee since I couldn't really leave my post.

It was definitely one of the most interesting experiences for me so far because it was a true professional set, not a buncha students messing around, this was a set full of professionals. I introduced myself to the writer/co-producer, a few tech guys, I had a nice talk with an electrician, and a bunch of the extras. Besides all this set experience, I also met some crazy cats up in Harlem, they were either 

A) Extremely interested in this production that had invaded their neighborhood and set fire to an old building.
B) OR B, mad because I needed them to either wait, or during the fire/smoke/water effects turn around and find an alternate route.

I was gracious to Dan and Mike for letting me crash at their place, we were wrapped at 1AM, I was done by 2AM. Dan waited for me over at 59th and Lexington. It was crazy to be thrown into the mix this late in their shooting season, but Ray Ray said I had a great first day.

I spoke to one of the extras about Boston, he said he'd never been, but asked if it was true that it was really ""All the good parts of New York City,"" I said yes, but too bad there ain't no movie industry there. It also was weird not seeing my parents all day, and barely talking to Chrissy!

Enjoy some pics, the show will be on in a few weeks, and when you see it you can think ""Hey, Vatche worked on set for the opening scenes!""

"event","I was at work a few days ago, rounding out the day, things tend to slow down by 4:30pm. My phone started to ring, there are very few people who call me around this time of the day: my house, chrissy, paul concemi, and occasionally my brother from his cell phone, but very rarely. The name ""Ray"" comes up on the caller ID. 

Ray Ray, my contact down at Law & Order was finally calling me, I'd given up on it a long time ago. I followed up with him once a week for the entire month of January, and finally said, I know when I'm being turned down. Yet, here was my phone, ringing, with Ray on the caller ID.

Vatche: Hello?
Ray: Hello there Vatche this is Ray from over at Law & Order.
Vatche: How are you?
Ray: Good good, how are you?
Vatche: Great (at this point if you read in between the lines, there was a hint of, tell me why you're calling meeee)
Ray: I was wondering if we could have you come in to work next Tuesday.
Vatche: (slight pause) I don't think that would be a problem!
Ray: Are you sure?
Vatche: I gotta check, but I'm 99% sure.

Ray Ray had lost my number, which was why he hadn't called in months, and he finally found it this week. What is the lesson learned here? Even if you think you've been rejected, just keep calling.

<b><i>Booth</b></i> and <B><i>Chelsea</b></i> both got accepted into Visions 2005. Booth is looking great! Chelsea needs plenty of work though, I'm going to do some compositing for it, and hopefully watch the latest cut.

<b><i>The Gift of Winter</b></i> played at the 6th Annual Armenian Film Festival at the Fresno State Armenian Film Festival last Friday.

So, it's been a relatively good week, if only I'd hear from an internship thats more then 2 days a week?"

"event","I dreamt I had a PSP yesterday, except in my dream, a PSP was like an xbox controller with a small screen in the center. I got over the fact that I wanted a PSP, basically because I would probably never play it, and can't justify spending 49.99 on freakin games.

I had a really good weekend, I went up to Fitchburg for the dance show, and Chrissy's 21st birthday! The dance show was good (a liiiitle long, but there were a LOT of good dances, especially Step, which Chrissy held her own in), we went to applebees after, and then to a party Chrissy's friends threw for her.

Sunday we drove around, had some bagels and coffee, and then went on a mini-Adventure to Mt. Wachusett, then we basked in the oily smells of the Old Mill. Chrissy and I both agree its overrated, I mean its a pretty location, and a cool old building (1736 I think?), but the food (so I hear) sucks.  I've never eaten there, but I've fed the ducks and stuff, but everytime I go into the building, the smell of the place is overpowering, it just does not smell good.

I didn't see <b><i>Sin City</b></I> but I hope to this week, along with a much needed haircut. I'm going to see the first cut of <b><i>Chelsea</b></i> most likely tonight, it is being passed into Visions by Paul. Booth is also being passed in.

Gardner Museum and the movies this Saturday with Chrissy, I'm looking forward to that. And hopefully I can pickup Sideways tonight!"

OutatimeBTF (12:33:46 PM): nope
OutatimeBTF (12:34:00 PM): im actually on an expedition in the artic
OutatimeBTF (12:34:17 PM): I'm studying Orca migration

It's tiring to explain to everyone that its a ""semester off,"" not internship, so I figure spice it up. Here is the simple and utter truth:

I didn't go to New York, I'm actually an MI6 operative, I was on a mission in Massachusetts trying to seek out terrorist recruiters in the State College system. I'm actually not Armenian, I'm an Irish redhead with former ties to the RA. I had surgery to darken my skin pigment and I had to spend every morning dying my hair black to keep the consistency, red hair is EXTREMELY hard to dye convincingly, at least I found it hard.

Having not found any terrorists at Fitchburg State College, I've been moved to a different department within MI6, no longer a field officer, I analyze satellite surveillance of Terrorist camps in middle Asia, making recommendations to senior staff. I'm happy to be back in London with my wife and three beautiful children.

PS, I'm not 21 I'm actually 38, I'm telling you plastic surgery has taken things so far."

Verse:
Im writing this letter to you,
to tell you all that you do.
It's a letter saying goodbye,
to put an end to all your lies.
I know it's just you, you can't help it.
When we held hands it just wouldn't fit.

Chorus:
I write this letter to you,
maybe you'll read it and you'll see the truth.
Please forgive me, I don't mean to be harsh,
and im sorry for seeming to rash.
But to me, you just weren't true.
That's why I write this goodbye letter to you...

Verse:
By the time you get this letter,
I'll be gone from the memories.
I'll be halfway up to heaven,
searching for a remedy, to cure this itch
that's been itching me so,
I gotta stop it at last before i go.
It's been itching me for months now,
and I've been thinking of some ways how
I can get rid of it once and for all...

Chorus:
I write this letter to you,
maybe you'll read it and you'll see the truth.
Please forgive me, I don't mean to be harsh,
and im sorry for seeming to rash.
But to me, you just weren't true.
That's why I write this goodbye letter to you...

Verse:
It's all over, the cut's been made.
Now I slowly think to my bitter grave.
I hope this letter went straight to your heart.
You've never told the truth before,
this letter should make you start.
I'm gone now this is The End.
Maybe now we can just be friends.
Cuz I found a cure for the itch.
I'm writing it down now, here it goes...

Chorus:
I write this letter to you.
Maybe you'll read it and you'll see the truth.
Please forgive me, I don't mean to be harsh,
and im sorry if i seem too rash.
But to me you just weren't true.
That's why I write this goodbye letter to you.
I write this goodbye letter to you..."

waiting for the day that im finally found.
i cant hold on, im losin my grip.
i start to break down when i think of ur lips,

"event","alright i wrote another song... here goes...

Can't help it, losing my grip.
Can't hold onto anything...
I need a hand to pull me back up
because my heart is so broken up.
If this was my way, you'd still be here...
Standing next to me, loving me.
But it's not, so these broken pieces still lay scattered on the floor.
They travel across the bedroom, over the couch, and out the door...
Everytime I see your face,
everytime our eyes meet,
it takes me back to that time and place,
where we were together forever, and we would die for each other.
If I could've had just one more day,
maybe you wouldn't have walked away...
It feels as if I'm going crazy,
but nobodies here to save me...
There's gotta be something wrong, 
can somebody please tell me what's going on?
Tell me why I'm fighting this losing war...
Tell me what the point of going on is for...
I need a hand to help me... 
Cause all i want is to be free.
And forget about you, and all that you do.
And then i see you face,
when our eyes always meet...
And I'm taken back to that time and place
where everything was normal, and the future was ours...
But now that time is over...

patiently awaiting the next time we can be together.
But when i look at my clock,
the numbers stay frozen...
motionless, undisturbed...
Still i wait here patiently for the next time i can see you.
But when i finally see you,
im lost in awe that i cant speak.
Just one touch will leave me breathless,
just one kiss and iim ready to die...
You have no idea how much i wanna share my emotions. 
My feelings for you are so strong,
they are uncontrollable...
I await the time we can be together... 
As i think of you i remember,
the taste of your lips,
just one more time...
Before we part again.
We lay and sleep side by side.
I hear the little breathes you take,
and i cant get over how much i love you.
One last touch will make me go crazy,
One last kiss, and i will cry...
One last touch,
and i swear, i swear to God im ready to die...
Just one last kiss,

"event","omg i finally wrote another song... tell me how u like this one:
""Take Me To Heaven""
verse1: Lord, I need guidance, please.
Guide me through this pain I feel now.
Lead me to my final salvation.
Take me out of this world,
away from my thoughts,
away from this hurt,
away from these problems in my life. 
Take me to a place where I'll be happy forever.

chorus: Take me to Heaven,
so I can be happy.
And no longer feel this pain. 
Feel the pain of a broken heart,
being kicked when your already down,
feeling lost with nowhere to go.
Just give me a sign,
a blessing to show that you hear my cries.
Take me to Heaven...

verse 2: I just can't take it anymore.
I need to run away,
from who i really am.
I can't stand up and face my fears.
The fear of never loving someone,
the fear of not being good enough,
the fear that I let someone down.
Just give me a path that I can somehow follow.
So I can run to Heaven and never turn back.

chorus 2x


alrite thats a wrap!  tell me how you like it iight? thanks"

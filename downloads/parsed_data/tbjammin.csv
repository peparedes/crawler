"event","Yesterday was a great. I started off by going to drivers ed, which was easy as usual, i got only 5 wrong on my mid-term. Then i went home and was supposed to hang out with a girl in my class, but that didn't work out, it was two complicated. So i sat home and watched the Majestic with Jim Carey which is a great movie. Then i went out with Bryan and Kevin, we went out to cold stone to get Beca some food. And then we went back to Kevin's house to watch the Last Samurai which is an amazing movie. It was cool because we just talked about stuff the whole time, we had al ot of laughs the entire night, then we went out to Wendy's and ate some food. Then we all headed home. It was nice just to hang with out having to do anything important!"

"event","So yesterday had to have been the funnest days i have had in a very long day! It started off bright and early with breakfast with Bryan and Carrie. Then we headed up to a swing singers thing. It was pretty fun, but thy guy was gay behond all belive. Then after that was over me Gregor,Bryan,Matt,Sarah,and Alyssa all went minigolfing. It was really fun, i got second but it was still a great time. Then I went home and showered for a bit, and then met back up with Bryan. We went to cpk for some great but unusall pizza. Then we just drove around forever. Then we met back up with Kevin and we filled up some watter ballons and took his 3-man lanuucher. We lanched a few off, but then we decided to go to it somewhre else. So then we ment into a negihborhd across for Ashley's party and launched a copel at them, then Chiris, and nick came running at us out of no where. And they didnt care that much at first! So then bryan drives away and realizes that he forgot his shoe and we forgot are bucket. So then they didnt want to get any closer so i walked up to get them, and then here came nick and chris again, but it semmed as if he didnt really care, becasue it was all in good fun. But then everyone started coming out at us. And Jake was ponding on the Bryans window telling him that hes got to F*** beat him up and other stuff like that. The doors were locked in the car while this happend, so i was traped out side. And then nick, and jake came after me, i stood there but then he pushed me backward and i stumbled over the curb, i have never seen a drunk guy that pissed about getting hit with a waterbloon again. He kept sayin the f word and talking all this smack, i was just like dude sry its not like we aimed to hit you exactly. AFter what seemed an hour he finally decided to step out of the way so that i could go. I tell you that was extremley scary, getting the crap beat out of me by some one 3 years older and twice the sizewas not the idea i had in mind when we lanuched them. But i luckily got away unharmed except for an excelerated heart rate. It just goes to show that Jake has anger managment, and i think it is in his best jugment to get that checked out before he goes and gets himself screwed. We never found the bucket so that sucked because that was the whole reason i was out of the car anyway. This event goes to show how a simple prank like water ballons, can turn into something alot greater and scaryier. But i do admit once getting away me Bryan and Kevin had great laughes the rest of the night!"

"event","Life...... Its a very complex thing. Through out the past few days, things haven't been what you would say great. My sister is sick, im getting sick, one of my friends hates my guts, are entire group of friends are talking behind each others backs. The bad thing is that when i look at everything that has happened over the past few weeks,i look at what i could have done differently. When people are distressed, most of the time they want to hear only what they want. And standing you ground is the key. Just after a while it getts harder and harder to do that. Things can back fire back in my face a thousand times for something stupid i have done, or some irresponsible remark i made about something not worth saying to other people. The truth is people make mistakes left and right everyday, and im willing to admit it, and alot of people are wililng to dot that. Its that people need to learn to forgive and forget and cut out all the drama and all the hating and bickering. Because i know i have tried to forgive, but every time i try it backfires, and im going to keep trying intill that person gets there head out of there ass and talks to me!!!lol But we shall see what today brings. Gots drivers ed, and im headin to the doctor. peace"

Then i went up into my room, and finished Spies Like Us, and it was a good movie. I fell asleep for maybe an hour, and alyssa called and asked if i wanted to play tennis, i said ok and then was picked up an hour later by her and her brother matt. I was so bad at tennis!!! Not a sport i would think of playing anually. Then me and alyssa went to kevin's house and watched t.v. and had a snack, and then later went for a swim. Then i went home and  watched a movie and showered, and we met back up and headed to the cougars game, because there was NOTHING!!!! else to do in batavia. The game was really boring, and very long. It was cool though because we meat up with Nick and Jordan for the second half so tthe game seemed to go by faster. After the game me kevin and alyssa went to mc.donalds and had a snack and then stoped at kevins house later. I came home really early tonight because i have a swim meet tommorw morning really early, and because my parents made me. But o well i guess i can come home early at least once, and it worked out because matt and carly are over here watchin a movie with my sis."

Then after a hard practice, i went stragigt to the high school for my voice lesson, which i was 10 minutes late as usuall. After that i went home, and went on a run, because i have to get in shape for confrence. After that i was so tired, but my mom suprised me with the invatation to go out side and cutt the grass. Then i went and watched pirates of the carribean. I got about and half and hour nap, and then i was woken up because i was goin to chicago. Kevin and alyssa picked me up, and then we headed over to emily's house to pick her up. We headed strait to the geneva train station, where we lucked out and found a parking spot farley quickly. When we arrived in chicago we took a really long walk in the wrong derection, intill me and emily realised what was going on, and we walked back the other way. Whne we finally arrived a millunium park, we sat there for a while, and realized that was not where the concert was being held. It was held on the other side of the park, where when we arrived the Afters were performing. Before howie day was soposed to play me and allysa went up onto a balcony so that we could get a better view of the stage. Im happy we did that because it was way to crouded down by the stage. We watied an hour longer that we were supposed to, and then howie day finally came out and he only played 4 songs!!! I was pissed, but it was still fun. Then we went on another walk to jamba juice, and then down and around the lake. We then headed back towards the train station, and me and emily walked a little ahead, and then got a clal that they had stoped at a pizza place, so we walked all the way back. After a short meal we made it back to the train station, and headed home. It was an altogether fun day, and im really happy i decided to go."

And if you know me ud no i usully only get 2-4 hours every day. Anyways lets just say i was wired. Well i woke up and the i sat around for a little while just on the computer and watched some movies. Then Carie called and i took her sisters dog out. That has to be the coolest dog i have ever seen! Then Carie called and i went over and kevin met up with us and we just hung out. It was really nice because we hadnt hung out with carie in a really long time, ever since the whole drama session started. After that me and kevin went and picked up alysa and then on to pick up bryan. Then we headed up to portilios. It was really good, i had been cravin it for a long time. 
    Then we all went down to the windmill city fest while emily met up with us. Lets just say that is the worst fair i have ever seen!! IT was awfull. But while there me and bryan did the golf shot thing over the water. The first time i did it i was a little off. But then the last ball i hit went only like 2 feet over the green, and hit a boat that was picking up the golf balls in the water. IT was so funny, because the guy almost fell in. Then we all headed up to alysa's house. It was really nice the whole time we just laid there and watched Finding Neverland, which is something we very rarley do. We usually talk the whole time. After that Me kevin and Bryan went to bryans and then to pick up shump, and then met up with evan at the fest again! Shump stayed two seconds and then went home, and then we all went back to my house. We stayed for a little while and talked to my sister, and then we went and picked up baby kevin, who had jsut snuck out of his house, and we went to the randall street cafe. After that we drove around and listend to music for a while,and did some star gazzing. After that we dropped baby kevin off and went back to my house. We went in the hot tube and watched a movie and that was the night.

I thought that it was awesome! Alot of people didnt like it, but i thought it was great, except for invisible girls cheezey lines here and there. 
     Then that morning after we all got a good nights rest, not! Anyways i was really suprised that my mom did not make me get up for swimming, THANK THE LORD!!! i would have only gotten 2 hours of sleep. But yeah she didnt, so kevin picked me up around 9:30, and then we picked up Lis. We all met up at the train station, and everyone made it excepth gergor didnt make the train. I felt bad. But anyways we got to the zoo and it was awesome. I hadent been there an a long time! My favorite animal was the dolphins. Thank you to Lis and emily, because they are the only ones who actually came with me to see them in the dolphin trick show. then my second faviorite definitly had to be the monkeys. they were so funny, exspecially the gorillias with there babys. It was really interesting. Anyways the whole zoo experience was really cool. And timothe is a really cool kid!! 
      Then we maid it back with no hasel, and we droped of  baby kevin and timothe, and then lis. Then me ad kevin went to kevins house and did some stuff, and then we went to mc donalds, to get some grub. ANd then we headed to The Knuckles Moose. And it was awesome. I really hope teh group doesnt split up when they got to college, because they have some much pottenial together. I just thought the entier concert was awesome and a great expierence. Then we went to chilis which was pretty much the same as it allways is. Didnt really want to go there.
      Then after wards kevin took everyone home, because he was tired sot then he went to bed. So me and bryan drove around for a little while and then we met up with emily, and lauren. Bryan went home but i stayed there.... Lets just say i never want to be the only guy when there are three girls having a conversation. It was kinda sick but i go through it. I came home and watched the transporter... i thought it was a really good movie. Anyways big day ahead...not really but whatever

"event","So what can i say, im not one to come on the computer every day and update my live journal. But this past week, lots of things have happend, so i feel that i should update for once. Last wedsday started off to be a grate day. I started out the day with 3 1/2 hours of sleep, thanks to swimming. But after that i went to my first golf lesson, which was so much fun, and help. I was hitting the ball 200 yards!! Thats so much farther than i have ever hit it. Anyways after that i came home already sweating perfusley to find that i had to mow the lawn. Which was awfull but i made it through it. After that Pat and emily came and picked me up, and we went to the corey. It was so much fun me and pat just went around and dove of all the jumps and stuff. The only bad thing was the amount of trying to be cool middle schoolers. After that Emily dropped me and Pat at kevins house, which was fun i watched the coofey movie, while bryan, lauren, and carie met up with us. Then we all decided to go to chipotle for some free food... thanks to randall. After we all went to see war of the worlds at AMC 30. It was a great movie except we were sitting in the front row. This is where the drama happend, i went with kevin pat and lauren in the car. Were i soon found the amount of tennsion between them by the amount of yelling that was happening. So after lots of yelling we went to JB which was also bad because there everyone met up with us, and lots of harsh words were spread. I dont know where i stand in this because i dont agree with either of the sides. Anyways i asked kevin to take me home and he did. Later i found that lauren, pat, and kevin were no longer friends, and that everyone hated everyone. I also found out that pat and carie got back together. Which im fine with...really. But it just made me mad because of all the things they said over there two days apart. And all the stress and fights i got in with my friends trying to help carie. But whatever we will work it out eventually.....i hope?! Then the next five days i went camping with family, to lake whatever....(cant spell it!) It kinda sucked becaue lauren invited the girl i had to go to sadies with.... who supposlibly thinks i like her!! Because of the amount of times i was making fun of her and yelling at her. Which acutaly means i dont like her at all and i think she annoying. But whatever. But anyways we went boating every day and i got really tan. It was all around a fun 5 days. Then the fourth was fun just hung with friends the entire time, the fire works were awesome. Then yestureday was fun, me kevin and and kevin went to the outlet mall and walked around and watched a movie, in the small bose theater... It was awesome, and thats all im going to say. Then we went and picked up allysa and went and played four squar, it was so much fun. Later evan met up with us and kevin had the crazy idea to go creak walking, which was so fun. We walked all the way to the fox river. Sick but fun. Then we split up me and allysa walked back because we wanted to get as far away from the river as possible. And when we were walking by JB some weird people followed us in there car. It was so scary, but nothing happend. Then we just sat around and went swimming. It was one of the best days i have had in a while. Anyways im going on a bike ride now with pat. so viva loca"

"event","I havent updated in a while, because of my gay computer! This past week there have been lots of laughs, crys, and fights. Relay for life was fun, but it was also very hectic. Two of my good friends who were together.... lets just say it was a hard breakup. It was hard because i got into the middle of it, by tring to help, and it sucked becasue Pat got really mad at me when i tried to support Carie. I think me and pat are getting better now. There were lots of laughs, like when me Kevin (aka 1 incher) Kevin, Pat, and Shump, and Al, all went to get back at my sister. Because she decorated Kevins car. So we posted the eniter thing. It was very funny. Or yesturday when me Al Keivin and 1 incher were on are way to pick of shump. So we were almost to her house, and lets just say we were listening to some gangsta music. One of the songs we were listening two was my Goodies. As we were blaring My Goodies, we were driving by some weird chinese lady watering her flowers. As we drove by Kevin screamed My Goodies extremley loud. And the lady turned around and she had a huge smile on her face. It was so funny, we later drove by again and she had the same reaction. I lauged so hard and for so long. There was also some more drama. Me and this girl who almost got together but then didnt because i was an adiot. Had a conversation after a bad run in at Sweedish days. (thanks alaina and katie)!!! But anyways i told her how i felt and that i was soory and that i wanted to start over, but i dont know what she thinks. She didnt respond alot. But then its weird because she called kevin after not talking ot him for like a month. Which is weird because it makes me think she might be thinking of giving me a second chance, if shes calling one of my best friends out of the blue for no aparent reason. Well im at Kevins right now... becasue the computer at my house doesnt work!!! Suck. But Im off to swim. Peace Out..........Amen"

"event","I didnt really get to say everything i wanted to stay becaus a certain someone who goes by the name kevin martin was kicking me off the computer so that he could create his live journal to. But then unlike my paragraph he wrote an essay. But back to my adventure of the day. While we were hiking we found a very old buliding that almost exactly resmbled a castel. Although we could not get it because it was closed, it was still very interesting. Then on are way home Don (Pat dad) decided to not wate in traffic, so we took a diffrent wrote, which took us straight into the ghetto! It was very scary, but also very funny. while we drove through i found that all we could do is make fun of the culture and the way the people on the street act. Almost every man i saw on the street was wearing jeans and a white tee-shirt. It was kinda scary because it looked ass if they were all one gang, and that they were going to jump are car all at once. Then when we got back i put up with listning to Kevin King and Evan Cutworth debate about the burning of the american flag. They both have good arguments, but i tend to decide with evan on this matter. I dont belive that the government should have controll with what the citizens belive, or how they choose to protest. Although i will say i completley disaggree to the burning of the flag! But that doesnt me that we can protest one way and the critsize other peoples actions. I think that America needs to take a step back, becuase we think we are the all mightyfull god! And we need to realize that we are not alwyas right! Any ways..... off to bed

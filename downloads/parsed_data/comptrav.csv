"event","Well, first post since october.  Fuck. I am definately not a very active member.  Oh well. I'm in Korea. Found a great hotel. Its listed as first class on the map, but since a beach front hotel, and it is off season, the rooms are cheap as fuck. $70 a night for a room with 2 beds. $63 for the second night. I bought alot of shit this cruise.  Hong Kong is a shoppers paradise. Its great getting lost in that city.  You find the coolest shit for cheap. Found some OLD chinese porceline boxes with silverwork for $5 a piece. My little brother will get one. Also found an Awsome cherrywood jewelry box with opal, coral, and motherof pearl inlay for my mom. Got a bit of jade for various members or my family. This port, I've already bought a nice ankle-length leather trench for myself and I plan to buy some more of the ""mink"" blankets and robes they sell here.  Those things are soft and warm as hell.  I used one of the blankets as a bed last summer before I picked up a futon. My house finally has real funiture since TJ and Matt moved in.  They brought alot of stuff with them from Dave's place. Some of its going with brian when he leaves, but oh well. I've severly built up my ""army"" of gundams. I'll have to post pics when we get back in. I've overfilled my desk with only about half of them. Well, got a few more things to check out online before joining Anthony and Dustin in Starcraft. I'll try to post more often."

He's only 11, but he's 5'1"" and 140lbs.  Thats huge. Unfortunately, don't have a car or cell phone right now.  can't really do much until I get a car at the very least. First thing I had to do after getting back was get my parents wifi working again.  Needed it up and running so I can do my DLs.  Well, may post again later."

Well, last night was fun.  Just hangin out with K and B, drinkin a little, or alot in B's case, and chattin. Today's going decent enough for me.  I signed the contract for my house, but I still have to run the paperwork to get the money.  Gotta get that shit done before we pull out next week.  Overall things could be worse.

K, hang in there.  Things may be hard, but just remember that there are people that care about you."

I think that there are somethings that cannot be explained by science, but all the religions I've seen can't explain everything except through the words ""(Insert diety here) just did it"""

"event","Yes I am saying that at 4 am, but what you gotta realize is that this day started for me at 8:30 Sunday morning. I'm not feeling very tired right now, a half pot of coffee with lots of sugar saw to that. still have another 3 hours of watch here. If I'm lucky, I'll be getting off work an hour or so after that, if not, it'll be 4 hours after.  Then I have the hour long trip home, and then my really nice futon.  I'm not even thinking of getting my new computer gear set up today (an UPS and wireless router for the house).  We don't have internet there yet anyway, so its not that big a deal. Hopefully we'll have it by the end of the week though.  I had a really nice weekend though, even with not sleeping before coming into work.  Started Saturday off bowling with a friend and one of his friends from the area.  Then we met up with another friend to go to TGIF. Great food and drinks there. It was also interesting in that our group was 3 American guys and 1 Scottish chick hanging around Japan.  Well, after lunch, the Scottish chick left to go home and we went back to bowling.  K, a very nice, very pretty Japanese girl and friend of B met us at the bowling alley to hang out.  We all went out to get some drinks and a little food afterwards.  We had some great conversation, as you can only have among a group of relaxed friends and then went back home.  Here's where it started getting interesting.  I decided to watch a little anime before turning in for the night and B started up an email conversation with K.  A little while later, B comes into my room saying ""Congratulations, you now have a Japanese girlfriend."" 10 second pause at this point as I attempted to absorb the statement. He gives me her email and we strike up a conversation. Apperently K had thought I was very cute.  This was an even bigger shock cuz I definately don't see it in myself. I have recently lost about 40 lbs and I guess I still work off the old self image. K apperently also does not see herself as attractive, but she definately is.  Most Japanese people may see her as a little overweight, but to American eyes she is simply well proportioned, and decently filled out in the right places. I can just imagine her disagreeing with this post when she reads it, but K, its the truth.  Add to this that she is very intelligent and you have a nearly irrisistable girl in my opinion. Anyway, we converse till about 1:30 in the morning through email, just asking quick questions of each other then go to sleep. Wake up Sunday at 8:30 and start getting ready for the RPG game we are hosting for the day.  To make a very long story short, we game from 3 p.m. to about 4 a.m. This is the time that B and I have to leave for work since we had to be here by 6:30 today, or rather yesterday. Okay, steam just ran out, need more coffee."

Getting my anime fix off of mirc, downloading firewall programs off kazaa, and finished up d'l'in' the disks for Mandrakelinux 10 off bittorrent.  Very productive evening, at least to a data nut.  Internet gets hooked up in the house tomorrow. Kazaa, beware. I'll have one if not both computers downloading 24/7. It'll be great. Got my UPS in the mail today.  God, its going to be a bitch to get that thing home.  Got it in my FR locker right now.  Gonna bring in a seabag tomorrow to get it and my DVD cases back to the house. And I just screwed up my dls by installing zonealarm. mother fucker.  oh, well. Time to pack up and go to sleep then."

During this inport, I'll be getting my house set up.  God it will be good to not have to sleep on the boat unless I want to save time before duty days. Been dealin with a lot of shit in the shop.  Sups been a bitch, but I think thats startin to turn around after we talked.  Night sup keeps trying to go street thug on me.  He could prolly kick my ass, but he would be the one hurtin in the long run.  Restriction and loss of rank would not go over well with him.  well, as I'm sure everyone has heard, Bryan made IT2.  With that he will get alot more pay and won't ever have to worry about being in by midnight. Well, not much else."

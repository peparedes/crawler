Thanks to <lj user=xtin> I today have a mei tai! Honestly could not be happier. Emily is sleeping (even though she didn't really want to much) and I couldn't get to try it out with her right away. BUT I was able to try it with my two year old nephew. He'll sometimes allow me to pop him in my Little Star pouch, and it would be fine for awhile, but obviously with a two year old whose getting nearer to 30lbs (he's about 25lbs) a one shoulder carry isn't great for long stretchs. He loved the mei tai and cuddled right in.<P>

Guh! I'm head over heels.<P>

Two hours of sleep and teething be damned! I have the carrier I've wanted forever."

Today was a rotten horrible awful day."

BUT one day I will own a mei tai. I will. Come hell or high water. The slings are nice and all and I appreciate them more than anything but dude, killer after having to be out for four hours. And it's too warm for wrapping.<P>

So yes ... one day ... I will have one.<P>

heh I just wish it was NOW."

"event","Since coming home and letting everyone who needed to know, this journal has seemed to die away. Only, to be replaced with the regular one I'd always been using. Before anyone knew, Mister's parents read mine and I hardly ever did friends only and wanted to keep quiet. The reason behind this journal.<P>

"event","I guess maybe the banjo playing after 11pm will continue. Perhaps until he has actually worked out a song. heh it is the most ridiculous thing I've seen and heard. But ""you're little and have no ears and or hair.""<P>

My mother has been told, along with all of my sisters. It was taken exactly like I had expected it to be. Maybe even a little better. The only thing to upset my mother was that I am here unable to really get any care, plus appearently my sisters and I would all more or less be considered high risk pregnancies. I know very well about my brother and all of his problems, but I didn't even consider that with me. So now everyone is in a hurry to get me home even sooner. <P>

I need to bake bread, but lately, the idea of eating or touching anything squishy really makes me sick. It's hilarious and I've never heard of anything so strange. So maybe we'll have no bread unless the mister would like to bake it.<P>

If I sit on the floor too long I get a pain in my ass. My sister has been laughing at me. And if this kid is a boy, it will be offically nameless. We cannot come up with anything. It's wonderful we've such a long time to figure it out."

"event","If it were not for Graham crackers and water being tucked inbetween our pillows, I'm sure I would be a horrible mess come six am when it is time to get up. Or in the middle of the night, like now, where the queasy feeling wakes me up. Sleeping on my back, while it has never been my favourite position now only seems to be the one that does not constantly make me sick feeling. Although, it does have it moments and then I'm left just wandering until it all passes. Thankfully, I've only ever really been sick enough to where I actually vomitted once and that was a week ago. I woke up to Arthur on PBS and they were planting tomatos and that was appearently too much knowledge for me.<P>

I would live on just hard chedder cheese sandwhichs with just butter, if I could. But since I cannot, I'm stuck for finding things I've actually got the paitence and gag reflex/guts to cook. Chicken and brocolli rice I might never look at again. Just the thought of it is enough to set me off. The same with Rolaids. Not that I make a meal of Rolaids, I've only even taken them twice and that was recently. Never again though. <P>

None of that is really important. Not that it needed it be. Mostly I just wanted to have an entry to say that while watching Sex in the City waiting for my stomach to settle, there was a part where Carrie's current guy was playing a banjo in the nude. I made mention of this to the mister, who replied to me ""Yeah, I can do that too."" He switched off the computer where he was editing, got up and went to the closet and pulled out the banjo (at 12am) and sat down. Then he proceeded to play (not naked) and sing ""you're really little and you've no hair"" after I told him that he'd eventually have to learn more kids songs. He tells me he's better at making things up and I have to agree. That was quite funny.<P>

It's unfortunate that I will be in another country for most, if not all of this pregnancy, while he is still here. So many things will be missed ... but we've to make due and it's best not to worry.<P>

Oh yes, and I wanted to remember that we thought/joked that we should name the baby ""du-lang du-lang"" from ... a song from the Time Life Malt Shop Memories collection. I cannot remember the name of the song just now though. I'll have to ask mister tomorrow so that I can edit this."

"event","After finding myself to be on and off sick for the past two weeks and a possibly late period (it has been off since March going from 28days to 36, so it was a little difficult to tell whether I was actually late or just waiting,) we finally tested. At 8:30am on Saturday August 5th, we got our first (glaringly) positve hpt. Just to be sure, we retested this morning and got the same answer and muchlike the first one, the positive appeared within seconds of being dipped.<P>

Oh my!<P>

At least this explains incredibly bizarre dreams where we have to fight people with tigers, that were actually trees. The tigers, not the people. And why I've only seemed to want Fruit Loops and Salt & Vinegar chips.<P>"

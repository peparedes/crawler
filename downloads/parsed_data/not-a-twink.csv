"event","Ethan's still working at the diner. The other day, he had the gall to criticize my waitering skills. ""You just aren't serving with the finesse of a true artist, Taylor,"" he condescended. Nevermind that the only person who gets to call me ""Taylor"" is Brian, and only if there is kinky roleplaying sex involved. I really had to restrain myself from punching him in the fucking nose - I suppose I can thank the large bowl of mushroom soup I was carrying for preventing that.

Last I heard, Mel and Linds are up to their elbows in children. Daphne commented about how cute it was the other day, and Brian and I kind of gave each other this Look. I think we were both thanking God that we were born without fallopian tubes. And then Brian fucked me, like, five times in a row, and we forgot all about children for a while.

In ""Rage"" news, I think Michael and I are meeting to discuss the next issue sometime this week. We've gotten rave reviews for the last one - I guess I'm not the only one who finds dark-haired superheroes in bondage really hot. (Don't worry, Hunter, I won't tell anyone about the jizz-filled copy stashed underneath your mattress. Oh, whoops.) 

P.S.: Ted? Emmett? What's going on with you two? Brian mentioned something about the ""absence of silly queens"" the other day, so I was just wondering. :)"

"event","Everyone keeps asking me what the fuck my problem is. I doubt they've noticed that I've stopped responding to their queries because they're so busy trying to ""crack my shell"", so for the curious, here it is, all laid-out nice and neat for you.

Hunter and I aren't really friends - we're not really enemies, either, though. We probably share some personality characteristics if I stop to think about it long enough: stubbornness, a yearning to exercise our free will, and, I'd like to say, intelligence-wise, we're both pretty on-par. We come from polar opposite backgrounds, too -- I know the correct names of every piece of silverware, and he can probably hot-wire a car -- but ... I don't think that necessarily makes us sworn enemies. 

There's not much love loss between us, but I definitely don't <I>hate</I> Hunter. And while we snark at each other, while sometimes the things EITHER OF US might say are bordering on rude and uncalled-for, the fact of the matter is that, even when I don't say anything to Hunter, nothing at ALL, people still chastise me, drudging up past things that I've said and taking them out of context. Meanwhile, Hunter is constantly defended and appraised because he's ""had a harder life"". And he may well have, and while I definitely don't think the bashing was Easy Street for me, I'll concede this point for the sake of getting to the bigger one.

Even when I'm not bothering Hunter, people are bothering me about Hunter. And recently, it's gotten to a point where Hunter and I aren't even discussing it -- that should clue everyone in to the idea that it's gone too far. If there aren't two distinct parties actually fighting a battle, perhaps it's because there isn't a battle to be fought. 

So for fuck's sake, lay off of me.

"event","So I was over at Michael's apartment the other day for ""Rage"" stuff -- don't give me that look, I know what you're thinking, and we didn't have a repeat occurance of the Brian & Justin Show -- and Michael had to run some errands, so it was just Hunter and I by ourselves.

Usually when I'm there, Hunter stays in his room; occasionally, he'll come out to snark at me when he's headed towards the bathroom or the refrigerator (which pretty much says everything you need to know about the priorities of teenage boys), but for the most part, it's silent discord. I go about my business, and he goes about his. 

So when I heard a loud 'thud' somewhere between the kitchen and the dining room, I didn't really think anything of it, at first. ""You know, you shouldn't masturbate against the counter,"" I called to him. ""People actually do like to eat <I>food</I> off of it."" No answer. Hunter <I>never</I> neglects to fire a snarky retort at me, except he just did, and that was what set off warning bells in my head.

When I got to the kitchen, I found Hunter lying on the linoleum, unconscious. There was also puddled milk from the half-full container that had come crashing down with him, which I quickly toweled up. I poked Hunter a couple of times and when I didn't get any response, I kind of freaked out. I mean, I know he's HIV positive and that the meds he's taking could have weird side-effects (I remember some of the less-amusing ones when I was popping a bunch of pills after the bashing, which is kind of the same thing), but I've never been and have no interest in being a doctor. What if he had a fatal reaction or something?

Panicked, I called 911 and gave them Michael and Ben's information; I stayed on the line until the paramedics arrived, and they asked me what relation I had to ""the victim"". I didn't really know how to describe it, so I just said ""a friend"", and they allowed me to ride along in the back of the ambulance because I didn't have any other way of getting to the hospital. In retrospect, I should have left a note for Michael/Ben, but everything was just kind of happening all at once and I didn't get a chance. So I'm sorry if you guys were weirded out when you got home.

At the hospital, Hunter was revived pretty quickly; they told me I could go and see him, and I wasn't sure I wanted to because it'd be so awkward, but I did. It's what I would have wanted somebody to do for me had I been in the hospital, I thought, and remembering that I had and that they only did when they knew I'd never see them (yes, Brian, Mom told me about your little late-night visits), I knew that I had to do this for Hunter. He thanked me for finding him, and said that he was actually happy that <I>I</I> was the one who'd been there. I asked him why and ... he basically told me that I wouldn't have freaked out on him if the reaction hadn't been just a fluke; I wouldn't have panicked, he thought, if he had died or something.

I didn't know how to respond to that, so I excused myself to go get a soda out of the hospital vending machine and to use the bathroom. I mean ... I don't really <I>like</I> Hunter, because he's an adolescent, horse-lipped twat, but Jesus Christ, I'm not completely heartless. I wouldn't want him to die, and ... and I would have fucking cared if he had. 

Brian told me a while ago that Ted had told him something similar after he woke up from that drug coma a couple of years ago; how Ted had signed Brian on as the person who could ""pull the plug"" if he were ever unable to for one reason or another, and when Brian asked why it had to be him, Ted said, ""it's because you're a heartless shit."" 

Brian never told me exactly how it made him feel (he really doesn't do that), but ... now, I have a pretty good idea."

"event","First thing's first: Ethan and I broke up. It was a combination of my being frustrated because he's gone so often, and his paranoia that I ""think about Brian too much and secretly want to be with him"". And ... I guess it's not entirely unfounded. He read about Brian's and my impromptu make-out session or whatever-it-was at Michael and Ben's house, too, and that pretty much was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

I didn't tell him about the love notes that I found in his dresser drawer, or the condom wrapper from a brand that neither of us use. It just ... didn't seem important. 

So yesterday afternoon, I went over to the comic book shop to show Michael the completed bondage-y ""Rage"" sketches, and who should walk in but Mr. Popular himself. I was going to leave because he obviously didn't want to acknowledge what had transpired, let alone <I>talk</I> about it, and I'm sure he came to see Michael anyways, but Michael wouldn't let either of us go. ""You guys have to talk this out. You owe him that much,"" he screamed at Brian. 

One of the things I've learned since that night we first met at Babylon is this: Brian does not like to do what people tell him to. The more somebody pushes, the more he pulls away; so I knew that what Michael was saying was just going in one ear and out the other without so much as a backward's glance, and ... I decided to take the plunge. 

""I'm sorry,"" I told him; he eventually asked what for, and I said, ""for making such a big deal out of this whole accidental kiss thing at Michael's house. For not understanding that you don't <I>do</I> relationships, even for me. For ... for leaving you in the first place."" 

He stared at me for a long time, and I heard Michael knock over a fucking display case, he was so shocked. Finally, Brian said, ""well, that's quite an apology."" I nodded. ""But,"" he said, and my heart just about fell through the floor; ""I'm not sure if it's one I can accept."" Michael made some kind of protesting noise and Brian indicated that he wasn't finished: ""And as difficult as accepting such a Grand Apology, dwelling on the past is passe,"" he said, and then, ""being this was our own Mikey's idea, let's ask him what he proposes."" 

Michael looked baffled. Finally, he cleared his throat, winked, and said, ""it's not officially an apology unless you seal it with a kiss."" 

So ... we did. And it was nice. 

And then, as if on cue, Hunter and Daphne walked in. I don't think I'm ever going to hear the end of this now. Still, before Brian left, we made plans to get in touch. So, all things considered, it's been a decent day."

"event","I've done a really stupid thing.

I was over at Michael and Ben's house the other night, working on ""Rage"" sketches. Michael had this ""fabulous"" idea to create a bug-chaser villain who tries to infect Rage with HIV by seducing him with his sex!glare, and in the end, JT ends up in a passionate embrace while Rage is still in bondage. It's a pretty hot scene, and kind of uncomfortable to draw with other people around, if you know what I mean. 

So anyways, Ben and Hunter were having some sort of argument in the other room (something about Ben's cooking, mixed in with a dash of Hunter's bellyaching because I kicked his ass at Tomb Raider and now he has to dress up in the outfit Michael wore to Pride last year), and Michael went to go see why the noise was suddenly muffled, and if it meant that they'd finally succeeded in killing each other. I kept working on the sketches, and almost had a heart attack when somebody whispered right in my ear, ""<I>those are pretty hot.</I>""

It was Brian, of course - I forgot that he has a key to Michael's place, and also that he said he'd be coming by to drag Michael to Babylon. What happened next is still a bit ... fuzzy. I know he was leaning over me, and his breath was alternatively on my cheek and neck. I tilted my face up to look at him, and our eyes met ... and all of the sudden, we were kissing. 

I want to say it was all his fault, because Brian's such a good kisser, but ... Ethan's been gone a lot and I was practically drawing us fucking anyways, and, and ... God, it was hot. He had me kind of tilted and was supporting most of my upper body because I'm pretty sure my legs gave out, and his fingers were grazing the small of my back, almost ready to take my shirt off --

-- and then we both hear an ear-splitting shriek and jump. ""Talk about art imitating life!"" Hunter chortled. Asshole. And of course, closely on his heels were Michael, who looked surprised and angry, and Ben, who seemed to strangely understand why Brian's arms were still around my waist and our lips were swollen and faces flushed. 

So Michael snapped at Brian for being a bad influence on Hunter, and Hunter crowed about how he was ""so right"" until Ben pretty much grabbed him by the ear and hauled him back to his room, and Brian reluctantly lets me go and takes off with Michael without another word. I collected up the comic book sketches and left pretty quickly after that, too. I should have been ashamed, but sitting in Ethan's apartment by myself, still tasting Brian's mouth on mine, all I could think was, '<I>I wish we hadn't been interrupted</I>.'

Just ... fuck. Fuck, <I>fuck</I>, <B>fuck</B>."

""That's right,"" I told him. ""I also have pretty big dick. Isn't that right, Ethan?"" Unfortunately, my boyfriend chose to be mortified rather than amused, and the rest of the evening fell pretty flat from there.

<B>Incident:</B> Car Accident

<B>Reporting Officer:</B> Dtv. Horvath

<B>Date of Report:</B> 01/03/2004

At about 5:00 PM on March 1st, 2004, I met with one, Brian Kinney; one, Justin Taylor, and one, Ethan Gold for questioning at Allegheny General Hospital, in regards to a car accident involving Mr. Kinney and Mr. Gold. Mr. Taylor was in the room during the questioning, but did not provide any information. All three men looked bedraggled and were rather solemn-faced during the course of the meeting. 

Mr. Kinney described the car as a re-upholstered 1957 Corvette, green in color and complete with a $500 stereo system. The license plate is KINNEY-1. He estimated the price of the car at $30,000 and said that there were no distinguishing features or marks.

At approximately 7:35 PM on Friday evening, Mr. Kinney reports driving along on Liberty Avenue in his vehicle. He was not intoxicated, and reported not smoking or talking on his cell phone at the time of the incident. He was, however, receiving oral stimulation from a ""trick"" that he ""picked up"" from Babylon, a homosexual dance club on Liberty Avenue. 

Mr. Kinney reports that he did not see Mr. Gold, on foot, jaywalking across the street at approximately 7:35 PM, and admits to having ""possibly been distracted"" by the ""trick"". Mr. Gold and Mr. Kinney both agree that Mr. Gold was (1) not in a crosswalk and (2) not wearing reflective clothing. 

Mr. Gold admits that he was ""daydreaming"" and did not realize he had stepped off the curb ""anymore than Mr. Kinney was paying attention to anything except getting his dick sucked"". Mr. Gold suffered minor shin injuries where the car hit him at approximately three miles per hour. Neither the ""trick"" nor Mr. Kinney suffered any internal or external injuries. Mr. Gold, however, also fell to the ground upon impact and bruised his collarbone. Upon doctor's orders, he has been ordered not to pick up his violin for approximately three weeks.

Upon surveying the crime scene, I found no additional evidence - no broken glass, no items to retrieve, no photographs. I issued a sworn statement from both Mr. Kinney and Mr. Gold, and advised Mr. Kinney to get in contact with his insurance to reimburse Mr. Gold for his injuries. Mr. Kinney agreed without further incidence. </I>

Maybe I should start at the beginning. Brian called me the other night and said that Ethan had been in a minor car accident. He drove me over to the hospital (I would have asked Daph but she was at a friend's house studying for her Organic Chem midterm - God, that class must suck), and confessed that he'd been the one behind the wheel. 

I told him I believed him when he said it hadn't been ... intentional, or anything, but knowing Brian, he thinks I'm bullshitting him. He also said he'd pay all the medical bills since ""Ian can hardly pay for his own lunch, let alone a hospital stay""; I tried to get him to tell Ethan himself, but he refused. We also got stuck in the elevator on the way to his room, which was kind of awkward and kind of familiar at the same time. Nothing happened, though. 

Ethan was mad about Brian's ""treating him like a fucking charity case"" (the drugs that the doctors gave him for pain were making him cranky last night), but even more pissed off when they told him that he'd have to wear a neck brace for about three weeks. That means no violin playing, which equals no street corners, which is Ethan's primary source (okay, only source) of income. It's too bad the art gallery won't pay me for my stuff yet - we could really use the extra cash.

Detective Horvath called to say that somebody would be sent by to gather a police report for insurance reasons sometime tomorrow. He said Brian would need to be there too, to give ""his side"" of the story. I tried to tell him that the stories already matched up and that he could just fax Brian the bill (I was really hoping to keep him and Ethan from having to see much of each other), but no dice. 

So yeah. If anyone's wondering what's up on good old Liberty Avenue, there you go. :)"

"event","I went over to Brian's to ""hash out our differences"" like Lindsay suggested the other day. I can't say we did much of that - we really just kind of felt each other out for a couple of minutes before Brian clammed up and made it no small secret that he wanted me to leave. 

I know he still wants me, though. He'd shit if anyone else knew that, but I just ... there's no mistaking it. 

Problem is, I don't know how I feel about that information. In a way, I want to gloat, but in another, it makes me feel horrible that he's toking up ten times as much as he used to and downloading blond boy porn on his computer (yes, I saw that, Brian) and smoking like a chimney, according to Michael. Plus, it's not at all fair to Ethan to even be considering getting back toget- 

No. I refuse to go down that path. It can only lead to heartbreak, again. 

I wish Ethan were here instead of at some stuffy recital. I just really need to be held right now."

"event","I was going to stop by this evening to show you the painting I did of Ethan, as well as some other sketches (Ethan ""inspired"" me quite a lot once I got home last night :)), but I forgot that Brian was supposed to come over for dinner. 

I don't want to bother you guys later in the evening since Gus has a bedtime and I'm sure you and Melanie will be ""busy"" (:)!), so is it okay if I stop by tomorrow after my shift at the diner?

Have a good evening. :)"

"event","Ethan came home this evening. I'd like to say that he swept me up in his arms and that we made love until the wee hours of the morning, but ... it'd be a lie. 

In reality, he was irritable and I was possibly a bit lonely and clingy, so I didn't take it well when he ""just wanted to be left alone for a while"". In fact, I kind of yelled at him and then stomped out the door like petulent child. Then I got into cahoots with Hunter, because let's face it, we piss each other off really easily.

I didn't even mention the painting I'm doing of him. I honestly don't know how he'd take it tonight. Suffice to say, it just wasn't the romantic homecoming I've been fantasizing about all week."

Daphne was fucking around with Photoshop and e-mailed this to me. 

I think it's time I got myself a new best friend. Obviously, her sense of humour is completely fucked."

"event","Ethan called this evening, in-between some fancy violin concerto whose name I can never remember, and the time he was allotted for dinner before his next performance. 

He sounded good. Tired, but good. I miss him a lot - his apartment's pretty ... humble, so I get bored easily if he's not there to ""entertain"" me. :) 

Still, I don't know if I was just hearing things or what, but ... whoever that guy really close to the phone was when we were talking was bugging me. Not to mention, it sounded like he was sucking on Ethan's ear, or something.

Oh, well. I think I'll go work on one of the paintings for the upcoming art show for a while."

"event","I went over to Brian's place last night to pick up the rest of my ""shit"", as he so fondly refers to it, and to drop off my key. I didn't expect to be bringing the laptop Brian bought for me to draw with back to Ethan's, though, so it took me two trips. 

Brian's got some respiratory infection, which has kept him home from tricking for the better part of the week. I'm sure it's a great sacrifice for him, as well as the entire male population of gay Pittsburgh. Either way, it meant he was there when I stopped by, which was ... awkward, to say the least. 

He made a big show of occupying himself with the soup I brought over (""I'm okay"", my ass), and then made excuses and ran off to bed, so the accidental ""visit"" didn't really amount to much. Not that I was expecting it to, but ... I don't know, really. I don't know what I want anymore.

Anyways, it's almost time for my shift at the diner. I asked Debbie to give me some extra ones since Ethan's gone on some week-long competition with the PIFA orchestra - no sense in hanging around the apartment alone. 

And just so I don't forget:

<I>Upcoming Appointments:</I>

1. Michael - ""Rage"";
2. Lindsay - Art show."

"event","Much as I like the sense of camraderie and being part of a community, the fact remains that the Liberty Avenue diner just isn't big enough for Brian and I to inhabit at the same time. It's distracting to have him there, watching me surreptitiously as I wait tables and he pretends to read the newspaper. 

I oughta just ""on accident"" spill coffee on his crotch. That'll show him."

"event","Ethan woke me up with a violin serenade this morning, after which we made love, ate chocolate for breakfast, and contemplated going for a nice long stroll around Liberty Avenue after school is over this afternoon. This is exactly what I was missing with Brian: traditional romantic gestures that, if nothing else, tell me that Ethan cares. 

I guess, if I think about it long enough (in which case, my head begins to throb and my hand cannot stay steady long enough to finish whatever sketch I happen to be working on [which is inevitably when I'm in a murky enough mood to start thinking about it in the first place]), I realize that Brian's gestures, while not brimming with obvious displays of love, were nonetheless things I enjoyed. He could never seem to tell me flat-out that he cared, but . . . paying for my college tuition, making my Prom night one of the best events of my life (up until midnight, at least) . . . he wouldn't do that for just anyone. 

And then, I start to think about how many times he pushed me away, how many rude gestures and barriers he put up, and I'm reminded why I left. I couldn't deal with the mixed signals, the hurt feelings, the abrupt moodswings anymore, and then I saw him fucking Rage at the event that was supposed to be Michael's and my big comic debut (and it was, but that's besides the point), I knew we were at an impasse. 

Still, that doesn't stop me from missing him."

"event","I have not posted for weeks although I said I was going to to try to post something every day.  Well the reason is, I fell and fractured both my ankles.  So, this summer has been shot.  The good news is-I could not go home alone on two busted ankles, so I got to spend time with my daughter in Northern KY.  I'm guessing they might have gotten tired of my being around.  I could not take care of myself, cook, clean, do laundry, etc.  It was like the lap of luxury-people helped me instead of the other way around. 
I had physical therapy.  I couldn't drive.  I was totally dependent on others. I guess one could say, I survived surgery, I survived the splint, the sliding board and the wheelchair. The bedside commode and the bed as well.
 
I am grateful for text messaging on my new cell phone [the sound quit working on the old phone, had to use the speaker phone in order to hear anyone).
I am grateful for my friends and chosen family.
I am grateful for my lap-top.
I am grateful for low electricity bills.
I am grateful for being able to get around-someday I will be able to do that again.
I am grateful that I can teach-Dr. Goris allowed that I could do that so I wouldn't lose my job.  
I am grateful that I had time to read this summer. Couldn't do much else.
I am not grateful for infections that caused set-backs for me this past week.
I am not grateful for not being able to accomplish things this summer that will now have to wait because I will soon be working two jobs again.
I am grateful for Addison Kirk, a good patient and friend.
I am grateful for beautiful weather.
I am grateful to be alive at this time, and in this place"

I got a new shirt for school. I really like the style. It actually has what I call ""lettuce-leaf"" sleeves. It is a synthetic, though. I seldom wear synthetic tops. It has a pattern I like. It has a stand up collar, a two-button neck and a back belt that ties, so that as I lose weight, I can just adjust with the tie. Plus, won't that give students something else to look at, if I work at the whiteboard? HA HA. Anyway, this top just screamed You like me, you know it, I am perfect, and you won't regret buying me.  That seldom happens at Wal-Mart.

I bought camera batteries. They don't seem to last too long in this camera, but I really like the camera. I tried to buy AA lithium batteries, but THEY were sold OUT. What the hey-this is exactly why I hate Wal-Mart.  When you go to get some popular item, they haven't got it.
Over and over it happens to me there. Arrrgh.

Then I came home-I was going to Juanita's house, but came home-oops.
I have to go over there in a minute.
To talk to the pool people again.
We are having algae issues.
Anybody know why we have spent so much time and trouble and this year can't get this fixed?
Now I will call and talk about hard water.
I think we should just empty it of water, clean it and go on, as much as we have spent on this to no avail.  I want to swim.

I think we can get a discount on the water once a year, but am not sure.
I am going to call the city and see.

Got to eat now and off to Juanita's I go."

"event","Last Monday, the faculty and staff at Henderson Community College had a day-lomg back to school series of events, starting with a kick-off breakfast.
I couldn't make the breakfast, as I had to finish up at Deaconess, (I worked Sunday night there) and then drive to school.  As I pulled into the parking lot, I got a phone call. It was a coworker, calling to see where I was. She said ""You need to get over here to the Fine Arts Center within the next fifteen minutes."" I said I thought I'd missed the breakfast. She said ""Come anyway. You won an award!"" 
It turns out that I was chosen by the President of HCC to be honored with the President's Award for 2008. I know my boss, Randa Hawa, must have nominated me, but I also heard that the students had a hand in it because they couldn't nominate me for Teacher of the Year as that award only goes to full-time faculty members!
Anyway, as I walked into the center, many people were congratulating me, and I hadn't even seen the award. Dr. Lake gave me the award when I approached him and he congratulated me, also.  I was given a plaque that says:
Henderson Community College
President's Award
Gail Nelson
2008
Above the inscription there is a mirror etching of the college entrance.
It is fairly large.
So I said ""Thank you.""
For me, this is my gold medal.
Because I am only the second part-time faculty member to receive this honor.
Carol, it IS nice to be appreciated!"

"event","I have an upper respiratory virus going on. A summer cold is a different animal. I am hurting all over, have a slight cough, rhinitis, and just feel yucky.  I got called off for the first four hours of my shift today-it's summer and we only have twenty patients on the unit. I worked last night and I had four of the joint camper's and had to change their dressings in addition to all else I had to do-and two of them decided that they HAD to go to the bathroom before I did their dressings!

So anyway, here I sit. I might not have to work tonight. If Stacy calls in, then I will have to work, but she called in last weekend... I don't know if she has FMLA.

Nothing much exciting here. I don't know how to do an LJ cut, so if this is too long, I plead forgiveness.

I do use good hand washing, by the way. But oops, somehow I didn't break the chain of infection this time. 

I look forward to teaching in the fall. I have some new ideas to try out.

I have been going hiking on Wednesdays with my good friend, Maria.
We go to our own beautiful Audubon State Park.
We hike for three miles at least.
We don't have to go to the Smokies-we can hike right here in our own backyard!

We have seen white-tail deer and a fawn and muskrats and woodchucks and many birds and dragonflies and butterflies and much ""fun guys"" and ferns and you get the picture, don't you? Of course, wildflowers and trees. We stop to smell the roses-my Dad would insist.
Didn't realize exercise could be this much fun!

Now I want to go rock climbing... and whitewater rafting ...and hike the entire Appalachian trail... and tide-pooling... and beach walking...
and search for gems-but my friend said the gems are just sold in buckets of dirt you buy-she has done this-and you just sort through the bucket! WHAT?!
Tell me it ain't so-

Do I have any takers for any of the above?
If so, let's go tomorrow."

"event","Our wellness group at my college sponsored a ""Biggest Loser"" contest. Guess who won?
That's right-me! I won the traveling trophies and money. Not only did I lose 15 lbs, but I also won greatest percentage lost.  I was trying to lose the greatest percentage, because there were people who could lose more weight than I could. The contest took place over ten weeks. I lost 1.5 lbs per week average, which is what I wanted to do-lose two pounds per week.
My clothes fit and look better on me and I would like to lose 15 more lbs and this time not stop exercising and eating healthy.  I usually eat right, but I was eating out once a week at an all you can eatery, and I was eating a big salad with no dressing, but I ate some not really good for you things, and I didn't eat just one of something. On the other hand, I didn't gorge, either. I also allowed myself to eat dessert-high calorie dessert!
Knowing that I can control portion sizes, I am nevertheless staying away from Chinese and other all you can eateries. Too much temptation.  When I exercise-move it-I can actually eat pretty much anything I want within reason. I eat a low fat diet with fish, chicken and little red meat, I love fruits and vegetables... Seldom eat candy, cakes, cookies. I don't eat chips.
I do have to do exercise I enjoy. I would rather dance that walk. I do weight train, because  cardio alone doesn't rev up my metabolism, but weight training and cardio together do. I know why women like Curves.  I should join, but I can do it at home or the Y. I use the Deaconess fitness center at work.  I usually do weight training there, on Sat and Mon.
That's all. I'm done with this post but not with staying more fit."

On another note, I am trying to do some crafts that are not too time-consuming. Projects
that I can get done in one sitting, so to speak, because I tend to not finish things and they sit around and never get completed... (just two uncompleted projects right now). I call them works in progress, then I don't feel so bad about them not being done? Right?

I have this need to create and if I don't get to do this, I am not as happy as when I am creating, so, I am enjoying doing some bead-work.

There is drama in my friend's life more than in mine...She is going to work at a new job and leaving her employer without much time to replace her. While this situation can't be helped, she hates it and she wouldn't leave her present job if it had benefits, insurance, etc...why? Because she cares about Mr. Jerry.

I need to start crafting again, and pick up on some old projects and/or start new easily doable projects. I feel so much better when I spend a little time each day doing creative things!

I am going to plays and etc at the HCC FAC, so I am meeting that particular goal.

I am looking forward to the cold weather getting over with-taking one day at a time and saying two things-""This then too, will pass,"" and ""Oh wind, if winter comes, can spring be far behind?"" William Wordsworth, I think.

I did buy some more short stories, magazines, and a couple of paperbacks to read later.

I got Avery his birthday gifts, and they are all ready to be sent-if I can just remember them tomorrow! But I think I will make his card ???

She is a student at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Mass. She has a web site or two, so check her out. I really think she will make a name for herself in the jazz world-she has already sung at the Newport Jazz Festival.

Tonight as I was going out the door to leave for work, Michelle called and said I was on stand-by for 4 hours! Thank goodness, I didn't get to work and find out! That happened to me once before, and it has happened to Malissa, too.

So I have a little time to tell you all that the power of positive thinking is what I am trying to do at work.  It helped me get through an awfully busy night, where IV's went bad, when there were no supplies at hand, no washcloths where they should be, no meds in drawers, orders done-but not faxed to pharmacy- meds not given by the RN before me-on and on and on! Everyone wanted pain med at the same time, NOT my fault, I had a list (of to dos) all night long, and doctor calls, and the night did not go smoothly-then my new admission had to go to surgery at 1:00pm and she had Alzheimer's and etc...
The power of positive thinking is much better than being all negative...
I am going to be upbeat!
Power of the Positive! I am going to call this.

Then I get off work, and am almost to the parking garage, when I meet up with the sister of a friend of mine-seems this friend, Cheryl, is a patient and not doing well but she is not on my unit, even though she ought to be... She has a rare blood disorder that affects her immune system, and she can't fight off even the simplest infections, when it is ""acting up""- She just had to have an amputation of her right foot and now the left foot is going to have to be amputated! Now, what do I have to be upset about in MY life? They have to get her white cell count up, the infection under control, and then the amputation! Man!  The right leg is healing nicely, but there is no guarantee that everything is going to turn out all right! She has multiple 
chronic disorders, none of which she wants or did anything ""to get"" they weren't due to a wild lifestyle, simply genes and luck of the draw...
Everyone who reads this, do something spiritual for my dear friend to help her get through this latest change in her life-she would like that very much. Thank you."

I am grateful for having the means to spend some money on myself and go to see
""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" and ""Bowfire"" at the Henderson Fine Arts Center. I am going to see ""The von Trapp Children"" on December 12th. I have great seats for all of these. In Jan. I am going to see ""Rachel Price"" and also (later) an opera is actually coming to town! I won't have to ride the opera bus to Louisville! Whoo.  Then I will get to see a local production of ""Once Upon a Mattress"" I have to take off work for the last three, but I have PTO time I can use. 
I am grateful that I can get to the Center and back under my own steam.
I am grateful that I have someplace to go to for Thanksgiving-I prefer to be at Milena's, but will have a good time with my family here...'cause we're going to do trivia and some family type games (thanks Bryan). 
I do really want my family at Christmas, and I am planning to go to N.KY come heck or 26 inches of snow.
I am grateful for students who ""are caring people"" and who are in class to learn and contribute to their education... I have a good bunch this semester...
I am grateful for life-this may sound trite, but there was a time in my life when I wished for death...
I am getting tired, I am going to bed.  It is late."

My birthday started out awfully, but got better as the day progressed. I even got to talk to MNN and CY.
I am working on Halloween costumes and will be doing make-up.
My students are great, and in general, life is good...
Six odd things about me you probably don't know include:
1. I don't really like my foods touching on the plate, but I don't
have a sectional plate, except for the family reunion.
2. I want to be able to speak another language-it is on my list of things to 
accomplish before I die.
3. I have been on a submarine and got to go under water while inside it.
4. I have always wanted to own my own flower shop, and make flower arrangements.
5. My mother was on Art Linkletter's House Party. She was chosen to ask Art a question.  I ran all the way home from school the day the episode aired. Did I make it in time to see her?  Hell, no! The credits were already rolling as I ran into the living room. I didn't even see her. She got lots of prizes, though for being on camera...All that effort/story of my life. No VCRs yet. You know I was so upset, I never did ask what she asked of him!
6. I liked ""Memoirs of a Geisha""-the book, but I haven't seen the movie yet."

I always had plenty of things to do this summer, not teaching.
My boss, Randa, has asked me to work next semester, so I will.
I thought I might not even have enough students registered, but ended with nice numbers-more than 10 and less than 25.
Both classes seem like they will be good.
I hope so, anyway.
I am going to have my students do some hands on ""experiments"" to help them remember the concept of homeostasis.

"event","So-I was an hour late for work Friday, but they should be glad I got there!
If they expect me to drive to work from no. KY, a day after a 26 inch snowfall, then I know they expect me to get to work if the bridge is open. (The US41 twin bridges).
There was a storm in Henderson Friday. I have been here thirty years and have never seen more rain and wind. We were hammered!  No tornadoes-just a lot of straight-line winds-up to 80+ MPH.
All over town. All over the county.  Trees and power lines, some structural damages, but I am surprised that more downed trees and limbs didn't hit more 'things'-cars were demolished, houses, and roofs and that kind of thing-and according to the paper, more than half the city lost electrical power.
Well, I had to get out of a flooded area, there were large trees down on both ends of the alley, with accompanied power lines down, transformers blown. You see, at my friend's house, they can't park out on the street. We were parked in my friend's driveway out back. You have to use the alley to get in and out and both ends were blocked so we went through my brother-in-law's side yard. No power at gas stations to get gas, when we finally got to the station that was selling gas, it had only one working pump. Thanks to MIlena and Christina, they got me to Evansville in one piece. I followed them to Evansville and they followed me to our turn-off.  I was so upset by what I saw that I was actually a nervous wreck by the time I got to work..
 My son and I know lots of people whose homes/vehicles/property were damaged.  Many individuals still have no power.  Mine was restored after midnight Saturday night. I chose to stay at the hospital Saturday since the power was out. They have a place for us to stay in case of emergencies like this. It didn't cost me a cent. I shared a room with a friend.
     
My gratitude includes Milena and Christina, that Juanita's house didn't get flooded or a tree on it, that my house was spared-there are many trees behind my house. That there were no injuries to people during this storm, except one. There were a total of three semi's blown over. One of the drivers had a closed-head injury. I am grateful that the people I work with didn't chide me for being late. Most were really concerned and nice. Indeed, the person who stayed over to meet me was very helpful, and we found out that we live very close to one another and didn't even know it! I had a patient die Sat. am. Not a good last Fri., Sat., or Sun., but---

The thing is all the things in my refrigerator are ruined. I am grateful that I didn't have much in the freezer right now-I do in the winter, though! But I am going to have to replace
all kind of things in the fridge. Oh, well small price to pay considering what I could have had happen."

Now Big Brother is taking over another area.
We must have Lifequest check us out before we can get insurance.
If your lab values for blood glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Blood pressure, Triglycerides,
Risk Ratio, BMI and %Body fat are not low, desirable, or ideal, you must take action or pay a higher premium for insurance. Indeed, participation in Lifequest was mandatory if you want to have Deaconess insurance.
At least for employees, not for spouses.
As for me, I need the insurance badly. So I comply.
The upbeat to this is: All my tests were ideal, desirable, optimal, or so good they were rechecked (triglycerides) except-my BMI is too high, but my body fat range was just within the recommended level. So I don't have to *do* anything. No risk. I was counseled to get some exercise to improve my BMI. That's it.
I was given a list of ways to motivate myself to exercise.  Motivation is not needed. Good weather and time  are!"

But will they hold to whatever they decide to REWARD us with?  They promise and promise that we will have enough staff-but ha!@#$$%^. My big boss told me last weekend that she had hired ""help for night shift."" I haven't seen them yet... Also, I am dead set against Mandatory overtime, but you get to pick the spots you want to work-usually you don't have to stay over unless it is rather dire...they usually say, You must pick up 8 hours or X hours over this timeframe and if you don't, then you can actually get told you HAVE to work such and such...But you know I already work another job...

"event","Another physical ailment has popped up.  Friday at 11:30 I was suddenly and severely stricken with a vestibular problem that has never actually been diagnosed, even though I went to the ENT guys, who just said it ""could be Meniere's disease"" because I had the classic signs-hearing loss, ringing in my ears, and dizziness.
Now, I have had episodes of this since high school.  But this one took the cake.  I couldn't move, I couldn't drink or eat, I couldn't walk, or function at all. It was terrible.  Now, going back to the time I last lost work from this disorder, it was on Jan. 17th, 1999. That time I was at work, and I couldn't walk in a straight line and had difficulty giving a shot to a patient and had to leave work... This time I ended up in the ER because I couldn't move. And when I tried to move I became violently ill.
So I got in really fast and the Dr. was kind and gave me Ativan  and Phenergan IV.  But they couldn't stick me, it took three tries, and I know the labs came back with dehyration, but otherwise, OK.  Well the Ativan didn't help the vertigo but the Phenergan helped the nausea- but I was zonked by it and really could care less, except when I had to go to the bathroom (bedside commode). Well after two nights in said Deaconess Hospital, I finally felt well enough to go home. Dr. Cure-real name how's that for a joke? said NOT to work tonight. So now I am missing another weekend of work and we are short.. Man just when I thought things were
looking up! But there has to be a reason for things-because I am going to have some studies done to get to the bottom of this and hopefully get some help this time... maybe this time they will really help me?????"

Gratitude list-
Michael wasn't injured when he hit the concrete wall. 
He was not driving too fast for conditions.

Allen's dog Elliot was put to sleep this week-I am
glad he is taking it better now.

I had the money to get a new blow dryer and cordless phone-
and yes, it has two handsets this time, so Michael has his own
and I don't have to spend time hunting for the phone.

Lou fell out of her recliner-she laid there for two hours on
purpose-because she didn't want to push the button-she would have if she had
broken something she said but she knew I would be bringing Juanita
at 8:00. She cut her eye and bruised her forehead. Glad that is all.

Juanita woke up with blod coming out of her ear-turns out it was her ear
canal and not her eardrum-glad that her eardrum wasn't ruptured. 

The truck is now running fine after I left the ignition switch partly on-
me with the jumper cables gone and no way to start the truck without them 
(Andrew borrowed them and didn't bring them back).

All this and more happened this week in the life of Windygirl."

I am, thanks to my litte rosebud, able to drink raspberry ice and even a little peach tea and fruit punch drinks that are calorie free.  I like sugar free jello, too. I am starting to like some water again, but it has to be icy icy cold. I prefer bottled to the tap water we have here! I absolutely cannot stand diet soft drinks. I am happy, and hope to be tapering to water eventually.

I like Dancing with the Stars.  Wish I could dance. Master P has got to go!

I watched Skating with the Stars tonight when I woke up. Juanita nows how much I love figure skating.
She knows my cousin was a competitive (ice dance) skater.  How can they expect a non-skater to compete
with some of the stars who have been skating?

We all age, and to see Nancy Kerrigan and Tai, etc for me was a blast! Now some would say old skaters and old stars-yech.  But I liked the program. Nostalgia, I guess. Especially since this show was the seventies
music theme.  

Work has been challenging....Can I keep this up 'til I retire?  I don't know. Eleven patients at night?
For twelve hours, three consecutive nights? For how many more years?  But the pay is fantastic I keep telling myself. Whoever thought I could work less and get paid more?"

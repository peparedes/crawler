"event","<p><br />Au revoir, November 2008. <br /><br />I have been writing vast quantities. No, not here. It's slipping further from what I&nbsp;think about, maybe as a side effect of time and maybe as an indicator of the effects of time. <br /><br />As I currently have one last headcold to wedge into the final hours of this dastardly month, I should get to sleep fairly soon, and therefore only talk for a little while. <br /><br />I am in France. I am finishing up the first semester of college. I am living away from home, living abroad, speaking french. My classes are in french; my host family is fantastic- or at least, Marie is. Hugo is... well, that's a story that's been detailed so many times in so many places, that I shan't recant here right now. I have been learning to be dumb- as in, without a voice. and then have to find it again. to make new friends. to not know a single person. or place. <br /><br />to go to paris! to travel, on my own, with friends, to swim in the mediterranean, to almost see the old faces in the oldest haunts, the history alive and thrashing about. to really make friends, to tell stories, to make stories. musee d'orsay. to realize old aspirations. to go DO. to dream, and grab at it. to speak to speak, to become, to grow.</p><p>to live without an ocean.</p><p>a family friend committed suicide.&nbsp; a young friend had a miscarriage. another is tangled up in deceptions, and for the first time, I cannot go see, go hold, go talk. we are scattered, we are somewhat lost. the power of words is what holds us together yet, and just caring, but there's something to be said for intrinsic comfort of touch. a boy in our group went home because his girlfriend was pregnant. learn to fail, learn that knowledge isn't obliged to be sensical, that communication isn't guarenteed. a girl in our group got raped. we were baking her an organic apple pie, comfort fooding the right way, and watching happy movies, when my dad called. My mom had gone to sleep with a cold, and..passed away. November 14th. <br /><br />there's more to it than that. but it's hurtful awful harmful cryful and... in the past, now. remember remember, but let loose. <br /><br />I'm standing up, coming up, coming again, coming back -soon soon, coming undone, soon again, rebuilding up re re again again, never again. <br />I&nbsp;have a stack of letters from the past few months, and a few weeks of tears and a few hours of phone calls with my dad, tearing about all I've known and myself and our family, detrimental maybe necessary, and now growing it back, perhaps, or growing up and away, but not apart. <br /><br />I go home in 2 weeks, nearly to the day.<br /><br />this has been insane. <br /><br />I feel so much older. But alright, today. today is ok. and there will be another, and another- or perhaps not. You never know. So smile, for the love of friends, the sky, your eyes, for your family, for yourself. <br /><br />Christmas time and homeward soon, flying off across the sea to a frozen barren bristly island of deepest winter and oldest joys. <br /><br />there will be a memorial dance, and a service. I'll let you all know when. and goodnight, all <br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1247-3.jpg"" /><br /><br />.<br />What I&nbsp;have with me-</p><lj-cut text=""a glimpse""><p>&nbsp;</p><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1613.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1616.jpg"" />&nbsp; <img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1617.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1618.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1619.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1244.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1230-1.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1231.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1236-2.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1242.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1256-2.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1246.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1254.jpg"" />&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1257.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1255-1.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1249.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN2049.jpg"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/October113-1.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/IMGP0673.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/IMGP0624.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/IMGP0625.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/IMGP0626-1.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/IMG00010.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/IMGP0017.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/IMGP0014-1.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/IMG00011.jpg"" /><br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><p><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN4149.jpg"" /><br /><br />rest in peace, mom. the world loves you. <br /><br />rest, peace.

Hello!

things that have been conspiring, sheer fickleness, a shiny blank book, and the need for introspection before a big change has meant that I've been writing a lot a lot a lot, but mostly in a little book that I've been carrying everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

matters of the mind soul life tedium agenda foot heart wishes and daydreams and music and cynical observations and weather patterns and dress patterns
and, pretty much, if someone really wanted to prove, well, pretty near anything, all you'd have to do is look. insanity, crime, good will, malintent, copyright infringement. ding! 

Falcon Ridge? Amazing.&nbsp;

and that really about summarizes it

traa alalalala

I am. So. Excited.&nbsp;

...that was entirely almost necessary. Shush. Don't shush! write me letters! being confined to a seated realm, letters are wonderful! even&nbsp;of the electronic variety.&nbsp;

"event","daffodil buds 
and clamshells and my feet smell like sea weed and brine
I woke up late this morning and my room wasn't lit with an ambient golden, midmorn glow, because it's been so gray and stew-y, so I rolled back up in a ball and dreamed about flying
when I went out to feed the cats, the sun burst through the despondent lump of grayblue cloud-mass right above me, and my face warmed up, and a breeze scuttled around the dead leaves and blew forsythia scent up and all around me. I love forgetting what flowers smell like, just for that wonderful moment that comes every spring. 
the bluebells and snowdrops are everywhere, except that so is the excessive mud, from the excessive gray cold rain we've been enjoying.

Mom dad and I went down to the beach today, to go for a walk. We tend to bond better outside when we have the option of walking away quickly, or in a room full of crowded, happy dancing people. But that's a ponderance for another day. There were piles upon piles of great, so white they were almost glowing clam shells (and quohog too, and because we live here we know the difference... absurd pride?). So we turned around and drove the five minutes home, mom and I, to get buckets. We filled up the entire trunk of her car, frantically and methodically in turns shuttling gallon pail after gallon pail back and forth over the dunes. I don't know why this stuck out as the most important and exciting thing that happened today, but it's sort of a glistening moment. I guess it doesn't need any good reason. Oh, and small children are adorable and obnoxious - I was crouched over in a simian style (grunting and hairy and all) rooting through the piles of twisted, dried up seaweed and clattering shells into my dirty white pail, and sudden a pink glove appears right in front of my face. It is attached to a tiny little pink creature with butterfly barrets and she is laughing at me. Cute? She grabs some shells from right in front my impending hand and kicks off away from me, triumphant. That was Baby Imperialistic England, right there. Lil Victoria. Later, as mom and I are sinking into the mounded up sweep of sand that always fills the walkways, two twin boys begin bopping around us. They're about 3, I think. Hey, hey! Whatcha doin with all those shells? We're collecting them, so we fill up our driveway! It's muddy from all the rain. Oh. -thinking. All right, that's ok. The other twin darts off in between us. Hey! Hey! Ma'ams! (this seems logical, as the plural form of two scary looking women) Ma'ams, that's not your brother! He's my brother! What are you doing with my brother? 

and dancing on friday... at Brown. That was ..interesting. I'm glad though that I went. I needed to sort reactions out, to fit things in on an external level, besides all the nonsense my own subconscious puts me through. I'm glad I dealt with all those people who the first&nbsp; (and only) thing they ask is ""Did you hear back from schools?"" I'm glad that the brown students who met me were genuinely disappointed and surprised, some of them, and some of the a little disdainful. I'm really glad my friend was almost more upset than I was, that first day. It's not schaudenfraude, it's just assertation of something I held to be true. And I was looking more and more at my other schools, though I'm still going to do follow-ups on wesleyan and brown. And things won't be bad, no matter what, which I knew. The application process is an absolute crap shoot though. It's all bogus. 

But there are flowers and birds singing from 6 am until 8 pm and a blue to the sky that has a depth and a volume to it
and we talk about time travel and other dimensions
I wonder what the sky looks like from the higher dimensions, if seeing along the length of time and space combined would muddy it or intensify 
I wonder what an alien equivalent to picking flowers would be. It's all nonsense, of course,&nbsp; nonsensical I'm feeling quixotic and quizzical I want to rumble jumble words around I need to paint I may have an idea, I think it's time for pasta and some more fiddle.

I also would like to spend time with yous, my dears. because it's not like I'm intentionally idiosyncracising myself, I don't think that's necessary on any level. 

hey hey whatcha doing? watching the trees grow and the ground swell and the earth sing."

Moravian: Yes, with a Comenius Scholar Medallion Awardthing (which I think the letter said is one of two) which gives me money and elitist treats. 
Colby: Yes, with their Presidential Scholar thing, which is given to 30 people, and comes with *see above.
Skidmore: Yes, and I haven't even read their entire envelope yet, I know I got money. 

Cornell: wait listed.
Wesleyan: wait listed. :( 

Williams and Swarthmore: no. The reason I don't feel too shitty about that is that they both had 6% (and 7%, respectively) admittance rates this year. I hate life. 

Brown: To be revealed at 5 pm tomorrow. But. I feel incredibly depressed. and I also feel like i have no right to be. But I am, anyway. It's like I'm perpetually on this brink of being really -anything. but not there. and I don't know whether that's because I have some talent, but not enough ethic, whether I work too hard and don't start with enough, or whether I'm just bizarrely and unfortunately aware of where I stand and that makes me whiny. it could just be that. or it could be typical teenager angst.

I wish I could decide, and they would just listen to me. I would like to go here, because I think it would make me a sublimely happy person. I believe I may or may not deserve the chance at this happiness, but I would like to have it anyway. I would do Miss America proud and work for world peace. through semi useless ventures, such as a high-quality liberal arts education. But it's not just about bullshit school prestige. I'd really like to go, I just like it. 
&nbsp;
But. Oh well. I haven't actually visited either colby or skidmore, and I didn't dislike Moravian.. it was just that, in comparison with Brown, it was as wonderfully appealing, exciting, invigorating, refreshing. Maybe I like being around people who are smarter than I am. Maybe that's my problem. Because all the schools that want me, really want me, but there's a fine line that once again.. I'm just never quite there. for the really good.

we'll see tomorrow, but my stomach is a rock. I have a feeling crying is in order. Maybe if this entire YEAR was better, I wouldn't mind? Actually, if this year had been better, I might have handled the entire application process with a cleaner attack.

I might have could have should have (should definitley have, and even this makes me want to cry) applied Early Decision to the RISD-Brown dual major program back in October. But I was so confused and unhappy. And the deadline was so early. Is this fair, in the slightest?

Why am I whining? I have ""wonderful"" options. ....well, it's not whining, per se, except to myself, self abuse, regret. be the inch smarter? for once? 

You'll be alerted.
is it me or them I'm most afraid of disappointing? does it even matter to my mind?
---
p.s. On a sidebar, YAY ALLSTATE!! Nostalgia senior year, music beautiful, lack of dedication on the choir as a whole was a little disappointing, as was seeing a touch of our amazing director's smile fade, just a little, as he realized some people just didn't care. but it still soared and rang, and I still got goosebumps. I want the recording. 

--
p.p.s. New April resolutions: 
go swimming. go biking. go running. again. lose this ridiculous pity poundage this year has added. you mediocre lump. you're almost good enough for good colleges, and almost look nice in jeans. bah humbug! 
drink more water. the only thing I learned in french 3.
try not to be morose? when people act surprised when I'm happy, it's a flashing horrible warning sign. whatever happened to this year?
notice the daffodils. they're beautiful. I'm good at this. even if at nothing else. 
dance. for goodness' sake, dance.
fiddle more. 
read more.
frown less. 
resolve. resolutions. clarity, precision?

"event","<p>&nbsp;There are several things that should be said.<br /><br />February 28th, 2008 was PopPop's funeral. It was a really unconsoling affair. My whole family is disparate and messed up, and it was pretty awful. Because mom was his only child, I was the only grandchild there. However, the newer wife (after mom's mom died when I was three) had all her extended family there, for comfort measures and so on. Fine, a warm family gathering to celebrate a life, albeit posthumously. I always thought that funerals should take place when someone was first diagnosed. Get together and celebrate the life and friends, out where everyone can see and enjoy it. No regrets, as far as that's possible. Nothing that's plausible regretting, at any rate. Sickness and mortality are inevitable.. But I digress. Cold, they didn't mention my mom, or her mom, at all. ""Helen was the guiding light in Bob's life when he had nothing to live for."" ...Gee. Thanks. Way to make us feel whole, healed, united in sorrow and in joy and in blood. I didn't play, though I had brought it, since he liked it. But I did play that night, in the middle of the night, for about 2 hours. Everything I could think of- I don't even remember now. It's a good thing I don't live in the city for several reasons- I'd be a menace, playing phantom fiddle music at all hours of the morning; and secondly, I need trees and water to heal. I do. </p><p><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1239-1.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN1252.jpg"" /><br /><br />I voted. It was apparently ineffectual. This had a muting effect on my pysche. I may reconsider democracy in favor of a dictatorship headed by Yours Truly. I am joking. I may be joking?<br /><br />The play has actually been a lot of fun... and speaking of which, I'll finish this later, I need to get going in order to fry my poor hair. It seems strangely at odds with common sense that art requires such opposite things. Is performance art the same kind of art at all? It's performing, it's expression, but -exceptions?- not expressing yourself. Wait, who said it had to be?<br />I must flee. Flee, fleonce, fly!

It was the best house and show we've had yet, I finally have a proper post-play high<br />Supppperb<br />I miss my buds, my dears who start snorting so violently at the building of the spoof Les Mis barricade that they almost choke on their water, who laugh at the political puns thrown into the Gershwin lyrics without me explaining them, my lovely dorky wonderful friends<br />&lt;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I love this feeling. Even admitting the horrible stick of hair spray and slightly abused burn smell and tired feet and pink feathers fluffing to everything (you heard me) (shut up, ok?) ... it's awesome. It's a better rush than skydiving, because it's something you work for, over and over and over. One more!&nbsp;<br /><br />p.s. so far, I have been accepted to Moravian, with somewhere from 10-15000 in scholarships, plus the possibility of a full ride (and hella priviledges apparently, on the offchance that I really needed a boost in being a teacher's pet... oi) if I accept. April 1st. Ohgawd.<br /><br />p.p.s. swirly happies<br /><br />p.p.p.s. I haven't been dancing in far, far too long<br />unless you count every night with my gals...I'm going to miss this,&nbsp;I really am.&nbsp;It's been a tough- nay, horrid two weeks, but things are pretty darn good now. Souped for the cast party!! Eeeeeeeee.&nbsp;<br /><br />And in summary, meaning no disrespect, but rather the highest kind of salute I know... life goes on. </p>"

But ""finish"" teenage years? Oh Glory glory be. What have I done, precisely? Precise, a precision, cision, cisere, cut - a direct line cutting off one section of a way of thinking about yourself? What utter hogwash. But time does serve as an alert call, an alarm shrieking out&nbsp;--<br />shrieking? More like a pulse, steady. Pulses aren't steady.<br />This metaphor has died, without there ever being an intent of life. <br /><br /><br />There's a common sense to most religions, if you can see past the comfort-level object of a palpable deity figure. Objective moral codes and distinct reward and punishment systems, structure... Even if you disagree, they make sense on psychological levels. Nothing is particularly blaringly&nbsp;unbearable about religious people, any more than (horrors) all republicans are slimey and green. There is a certain level of blind trust in most that scares me, but if it's what you were taught, and then taught again and again and warned against straying from, it's not a wonder it stuck.&nbsp;<br /><br />I really am not sure what it is to look forward to next<br />I realized that, when Steve was up. lately I've been pacing myself without giving any particular value to time, mostly making sure things get done, failing on some counts. I think making lists means that, to some extent, you're not satisfied. I was perfectly content for&nbsp;a while to just be, just stay and enjoy. There are things we always look forward to, peaks of excitement<br />I just had a whole bunch in a row, and I'm very, very happy<br /><br />- Vacation. Nuff said.<br />- Stephephen. see above.<br />- my birthday! ...should I have done more by this point?<br />- my birthday party, and all the other mini get togethers and wonderful frilly straightforward silliness that this break was filled with. healing, lovely<br />- prayer of the children<br />- RI Art Scholastics 2 gold keys<br />- RI Elks MV Student Scholarship... money hooray!!&nbsp;<br />-boo tech week<br />-boo not having the play at all ready or worthwhile yet... BAH. knock on wood. With tap shoooes.<br /><br />inspiration inclincation<br />disinclination<br />I think they go together, to balance each other out and spin you off in a certain direction, lest you remain a renaissance student forever, eternally ineffectual and charming.&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you have to offend someone always? Dear Aesop.&nbsp;<br /><br />I swear, there are threads seaming this all together<br />but perhaps not<br />I could very easily be deluded, in my old age.&nbsp;<br />I really don't mean to be this cryptic, I'm just baffled and bemused, stuck between pristinely silly and happy with baby worries&nbsp;and the&nbsp;endless mindless worry-free, since there is no future, blue gray monotony that is MHS. June freedom? I think it's strange that this is the last february break, ever. They are always such beautiful things. The timing is lovely. ..another right now, for instance, would be just fine.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is how it is<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v735/amarthwen/DSCN4173-1.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br />please, a spin off, a rambling of your thoughts, an inspiration, dedication, song suggestion, folk lore story-&nbsp;<br /><br />love,<br />Sarah<br /><br />p.s. we're getting old, guys. fo sho."

You'll notice everything your 'name heading' disagrees with, spoken or not. Then as some time passes, you maybegin to feel isolated, a loner. Who -are- you without more who are like you at your side to back you up and voice your own shared opinions on surround sound? Just a loner, a freak. Listen to them, really listen. Parts will stick out as hypocritical, dumb, nasty, or just plain wrong - but parts might begin to gather a tint of truth, a shade of reason. Your own foundings shake and crack- who were you to lay blame on others? Just a loner, a freak who survives off its own policies breathed back at it from a friendly network. Yet, it all seems so right and true when you find yourself in that warm, engulfing embrace. How can some things be both ways?

New Year's evening.. I spent dancing, and laughing and smiling, and it was wonderful.

Time. I should work more on that blip of an idea in my Scholastics artist statement, it has budding potential. more like asparagus than mold capability and chutspa, but with the proper encouragement, great things could happen.&nbsp; p.s. working (being added to randomly) art portfolio posted last on photobucket. It's basically the same as is on facebook, and the image quality isn't great for all of them, because they were tricky. I'll hopefully get nice copies from MissBiss from the scholastics photographs, and one of my singleton too.

I really do have this bubbling optimism that makes very little sense and holds little relevance, just connected to the idea of 2008.
I also started seeing how beautiful some corners of my home are, just spot-notices

books: Pride and Prejudice.... Um. Hmm. I dig it, I do. And not just because it's a classic love story. It's cliche and passe and ""eternal"" and frustrating and enthralling and boring, but there's&nbsp;a charm to it, somehow.&nbsp;
+ everything else YUM. Yay books, getting back into reading in niches all the time. hooray

school: We need to all back Mr. McDevitt and hold a coup, finally

gershwin- HAHAHA. 

I am not feeling particularly inclined to write, which is unusual. I am actually blessedly sleepy, for the first well-timed occurance in days.

mystery, confusion, etc etc etc.&nbsp;

that pretty much describes my life right now

p.s. I want my fiddle fixed.&nbsp;

hot cocoa
laugh laugh laugh
love :)

+ little childs caroling, hope still exists. plus the sheer justness of singing in harmonies and wandering around happy. caroling is intrinsically right. they're like musicals... but without all the irritating foofarraw.

+ performance is a few hours, last one for chambers! :( But I think we're still meeting for recordings and such. Everything is always all at once, but hey. lurve.&nbsp;

my face is radiating heat and a poof of&nbsp;general satisied flaxen happiness is puddled all around as I thaw. Light-up tree, woodstove, and quiet

+ messiah sing
more festiveness


it's trite perhaps, but there's a peculiar secret to cliches. If you're involved and it's genuine, it doesn't matter.&nbsp;

+ DANCE NEW YEAR'S EXCITEMENT, hopefully

Hmm. showering? hygeine. ...yeah, ok, I guess. I really want to go sledding some more though, even though it's dark and the wind came up... yes, yes indeed.

"event","Happy Birthday, BIG brother! Now you're reeeally old. Yay :) No 1984 references intended. 

Let's play a game. I call it,&nbsp;""What are you wearing?"" I'll start. 
big, long stripey socks. 
fuzzy socks. 
big warm fuzzy sweats. 
a tanktop. 
a long-sleeved thermal. 
a sweatshirt. 
a scarf. 
one glove with the fingers cut off 
a silly green beret with a black pompom that my grandmother must have crocheted 
a bead necklace I am in love with.&nbsp; 

""Gee, Sarah, but aren't you inside?"" Ah, yes, my children. But isn't there heat inside, you may wonder -- and well you may. Normally, even at the Hirsch residence, some form of heat is usually kindled and available at one end of the house, directly over the glowing box that is our fireplace. And therein lies the problem. We currently have neither wood nor safety to light said fire, because the house is under construction.&nbsp; I am pondering rehashing this whole postulate of global warming; I am deeply sympathetic to frogs and squirrels and Innuits; I am wishing I had two gloves.&nbsp; I am invoking the subjunctive. And ignoring it, as it ought always to be. Passive. mwahaha. I am&nbsp;a grammar dorkus. So ..dorkum would be the accusative, libre dorkum, give the book to the dork, make his or her politically correct day?

How is life, everyone?

School school school. I want to speak goldfish. The french onomatopeia for goldfish noises is: glouglou! It even sounds like schoolschool, but somehow, much more appealing. 

Now then.&nbsp; 
Isn't it awfully time for a friday dance again (yes, already. that was the point. Oh HUSH up.)? 

whatever happened to razz?"

Similar to MissBiss, actually, and Hines, and well.. yeah. All of&nbsp;the interesting teachers. Sometimes when you're angry at someone boring you wonder what they're really thinking, but you don't usually mean it, it defeats the purpose of the anger, which goes against human nature.&nbsp;which is protection, I believe.<br /><br />I want my ceiling to be flat plaster,&nbsp;because I have an immense urge to paint endless, sweeping skyscapes in oils, where a sky should be, above and around. Those flat whispy clouds that look like the hair of an old woman combed with fork are currently my favorites, swept and bent around and flying out and fading out. Summer's favorite was of thunderheads and cloudbursts.&nbsp;<br /><br />piano = ...in my basement!!! = bestest thing to happen in a while.&nbsp; ..Little moment with mom yesterday, I'll try to relay it posthumously. Because it was a beautiful thing. Quintessentially beautiful moment.</p><p>usually when my mother goes downstairs for the night, it's not a happy affair, but it ranges in unpleasantness. always, soaked, intoxicated, buffered, angry, shouting, sobbing, impassive - it's always the bad end of her bipolar whenever it's time to sleep. Last night, she went down a little late, which was surprising because we had been hauling piano around. Then I heard some noise coming up the stairs, and my gut went blerfheb and I frowned and I was subconsciously prepared to be immune - and then it turned into piano notes. Soft, and then cascading, halting, banging around, lilting... I went down to see, and she was smiling and concentrating and adrift, all at once, pulling the tune out of somewhere long ago. I just watched for moments, just sitting there watching, and she just kept playing til her song resolved itself. She got up a couple of times during the night, too.&nbsp;<br />beautiful.&nbsp;<br /><br />the rest is angst or listing of preparation, and so I shall wait to see if it resolves itself. Let it just be said that I intend to wear my little black dress from freshman year to play at Erin's wedding, and that elastic stretch is a beautiful thing; that school could be better; that populating and copulating are overrated, as is grammar, and particularly, grammair.&nbsp;<br />Clouds. Painting clouds.<br /><br />I wish once again that I could simply dunk people under the&nbsp;ocean of a minefield of a metaphorically structured abused&nbsp;onion (I don't envision an onion when I picture myself, not at all, personally)&nbsp;that is me, have them choke and sputter and realize they could breathe, and then yank them out. Maybe an artichoke is better than an onion. Clouds.&nbsp;<br /><br />I miss dimples, and looking across and seeing someone smile and knowing entirely that the thought was shared, the moment appreciated for its stupidity or love or humor. It happens sometimes still. which almost makes me confused, but happy at the same time, that sharing can still go on. Sharing time, share and tell, paper bag full of coins and dead bugs. <br /><br />I think that integrity and sincerity are running dry stampeded in the rush of mating season squashed and buried and shouted over. I think there's far too much shouting at lunch.&nbsp;<br />I think we should have little tea tables under the great trees on the front lawn. with lawn flamingos. but of course.<br /><br />Emily Bronte just bit my toe, and my fiddle is sobbing dejectedly, touchy thing. (haha pun) I think it's time to go attend to these now. </p>"

It's amazing what he can do now, understand, what he's learned, from school and intuitively.. sink or swim sailing principles, square roots (ya heard me), far side comics, ... I remember when he called milk MeoMeo (like the noise George the cat made, of course), and pizza was the only word he could read. Times achanging.

colleges, aieee

people leaving, once again, on so many emotional levels

umm, the bright side of all the college kids packing out? Now Ryan Connel has to be niiice, or he won't have any guards left at allll, and he might have to you know.. guard. Outside of the guard room. ...or something drastic. 

music music running through my head, I can't sleep. it's punishment for slacking off with fiddle

there was a beautiful bride at the beach this afternoon. she tripped, and I felt bad, but she looked so happy I don't think it mattered much to her

I wish Alex, Ry and Maureen were staying longer, I have so much I'd like to get to and talk about... they shore me up, somehow. (sane adults in my life, say what?) I'll be seeing them all again soon, though I hope!
guilt snap visit pop pop....

and this song is looping through my mind tonight, chasing thoughts around. 
tomorrow begins my sabbaticalish. hooray. Punctuation is definite and grim sounding, as of late. we may need to report this discovery, as it could be treated in a timely fashion. Time. Urk. 
desperate, laughing, loved, crying, petty, deep, helpless, hopeless, optimistic, energized, inspired, lethargic, stardust, summer sun, fleeting. I'm out, figuratively and literally. goodnight, dears

Lullabye -- Billy Joel

Goodnight, my angel
 Time to close your eyes
 And save these questions for another day
 I think I know what you've been asking me
 I think you know what I've been trying to say
 I promised I would never leave you
 And you should always know
 Wherever you may go
 No matter where you are
 I never will be far away
 
 Goodnight, my angel
 Now it's time to sleep
 And still so many things I want to say
 Remember all the songs you sang for me
 When we went sailing on an emerald bay
 And like a boat out on the ocean
 I'm rocking you to sleep
 The water's dark and deep
 Inside this ancient heart
 You'll always be a part of me"

So- 
drive in, salt spray, singing, movies, painting
minor epiphanies about life at large that flit in and out of consciousness as I sit by myself. finally, something redeeming
less fiddle than I ought, but hatchings of a plan
speaking of lethargy induced
my bike is fixed!
the other cats seem to be ok, at least. they're certainly vocal.
cookouts, scrabble, boggle, apples to apples, set, competition, giggles, visits.
iced tea. 
train of thought? I swear I didn't have cryptic in mind when I sat down, this must be autopilot
segue to funny Darwin Awards movie
I find myself missing trees but still loving the water
I want to camp out on third beach overnight, come midevening, grill down at ramp and set up a tent in the middle of nowhere land, wake up to the sun rising across that flat, peaceful water. I saw a couple there a few days ago emerging from their tent and stretching, walking around at 8 am. Mr. Peabody said it's cool if you ask (and so on), and I have been beset with an intense urge to do so. 
reading are good, as someone once told me.
friendses are dissipated, scattered. but still themselves. which will have to do, and frankly, ain't bad.
super stoked about next week, providing all goes well.
super depressed and frightened about after that. surprise. 
mental blocking, even now. geez. if I turn into a faceless zombie who refuses to communicate, someone has to organize an orchestrated effort to kick me out of it. or open a circus. wouldn't want to miss out on the final days of the tourist season. 
European kids are better behaved than American ones. but maybe that's because I can't understand what they're saying. 
I still want to sew, but I haven't had the chance to get out to a fabric store. still.
time's a ticking, it's most disagreeable. I distinctly remember telling dear Mrs. Alexander, the Best Second Grade Teacher Ever, that I never wanted to grow up. We had been talking about roosters and Peter Pan. She laughed and said, But then you wouldn't get to, well, grow up! And do all sorts of exciting things! Well, maybe. But I'm still not convinced that this whooshing along of joyful times is a great idea (hellooo world, duh). Maybe if you could freeze frame things, just for a few moments, let the peace and happiness seap into you and all the details and nuances etch themselves into your appreciation, you could treasure them more when you were unhappy or hurting, or bored silly. Maybe though, that's why sometimes we write. Even about bad things. not so much for communication or expressing your ideas, working around a thorny ideological myth or weaving a story, but just to remember, and maybe try to share. off of that, is writing altruistic, selfish, or natural? Case studies, bah. 
Really, a little Sarah just poked up and thought, say you're sorry. Apologize for punishing those who deign to read and truck through all this. 
I er, am sorry if it bothers you and is too long and floofy. 
I've noticed my thoughts have gotten either longwinded or concise, one or the other. I partially blame the combination of my multiple independent studies and occupation, both with come with the hazard of meandering through time shiftlessly, tossing around ideas and talking and singing to oneself intermittantly. 
Missere, to aim, throw, to send. Ah, latin. 
Memories are weird.
I think it's time to go forage. Dad ate all the food. Well, tasty scrupulent (should so be a word) morsels, anyway. There are worse things, by far. 


p.s. MLA say what? this is the worst punctuation, etc. I've poured out in eons, it seems. Egad.

superflooding relief and concentration effort ease familiarity difficulty new laughing&nbsp;smiling happy messy goopy delight
finally.

My oils class started, at last. We painted done at Rock today. It shall be once a week until the first week in August, annnd (this is bizarre) I can't wait for the next monday. Ish. I want to get some stuff accomplished before then. ..but more paint wonderfulness.....yesss.

Sorry. I do in fact realize that I am being completely nonsensical right now -however. This was so much what I needed right now, I can barely describe it.&nbsp;
Being plunged back into something that I love, that's challenging and new but in a familiar way, where everyone is crazy, liberal, and NICE and no one tells you to work out and there's no seniority issues, only admiration for people who know what they're doing -- ahhhhhh


The class itself is going to be in a different location outside each week, with the beautiful late afternoon sun (or haze, as the case was this week. Equally lovely, actually). It's about 2ish hours long, so you have to work pretty quickly and brutally, and think on your feet. as it were. It's really different from school art, where you're doused in 30 minute segments of work time a couple times a week while thinking about trig homework and bomb threats. There are 8 of us in the class, plus my crazy (ain't they all?) teacher, Trish. The catch is that 6 are at least 50 years old, and some older. One other girl is about 20ish. And then there's me. No problem, though. It's so cool in and of itself that a) this doesn't bother them or me b) we're all there to learn and paint ...and. and. Ladies and Gents, I am thrilled, euphorically content and SOUPED for next week (norman bird).&nbsp;

[oh and did I mention she liked what I did giggle tehee? Positive reinforcement, delish! I am not entirely a waste of human, hooraaay! tehee again.]


On other notes:
Happy belated 4th, y'all. We celebrate our toddler country (think terrible twos, going around with new skills, and smashing things) with explosions, and that suits me fine. I may get some of my fav pics up that I've taken recently, fireworks and otherwise. I may not.&nbsp;

Camping trips, plural -- should happen this summer, no? Name dates you know for sure you will be gone, please. The sooner the better, we don't actually have that much time, which is startling.

this time last year, I was getting ready to pack it all in and head overseas. Last year?

Next dance in the works, ish. Aquidneck school, methinks. Please and thankyou for the repeated coming and supporting :)

If you have siblings, friends of any age, yourself, whatever - I want to start giving more fiddle lessons. For one, it'll make sure I don't slack off. Two, it's another thing I like and that seems worthwhile. Vs, you know. That whole lifeguarding crap.&nbsp;

Lifeguarding. Frustrating? beautiful setting, easy enough job, and plenty of good people, and good enough pay. Need to work my head around the couple of things rubbing raw. Or find a fairy dust mine. Preferred.

Craft booth for the fall shows - we should plan this further, as we all have spare time now, sort of.&nbsp;

Sewing! Yaaaay! Good nights, bad nights? Also needs to swing into action.

I've decided that I'm turning my brain back on, ish. It sort of died there for a little while. Screw buoy swims, life is grand.&nbsp;

love y'all"

"event","<p>There are only a few times I honestly want us to have more moneys available, and expendable.<br />These consist of the occasional completely selfish dress shopping (princess dresses, noo), but mostly doctor's appointments.<br /><br />Blechhh. I've been perfectly healthy for so long. You know. All those years we had almost complete medical coverage. No glasses, no allergies, not-yet foot problems, not even a bone fracture. Nothin. And know I'm looking at running back to that office and three others (blahhhh) -which, don't get me wrong, isn't the problem- with a ceiling of about $5000 on just tests for all this fainting nonsense, not to mention treatments, or all the shots that apparently are the new regulation for 17 year-old females. Yummy.<br /><br />To be fair, the male nurse (shush Stephen, he was at least 50, and very, very gay) was amazing. I feel like I should make him at least a card or something the next time I come in. ..allow me to briefly elaborate, because he really was a nice person. (this&nbsp;would be&nbsp;my ""good person highlight"" were I a snotty, selective paper. actually, it's really just so I can remember later on) He was nice with the kids, and calm with my literally screaming mother on the phone, and even polite, which is better than I can manage mostly. He was consistently intelligent but funny, and what got me most.. Eh. I really, really -- no, really- hate shots. I know almost everyone does, I know I'm not chronically phobic or anything, but I start crying if I have to get one in the near future, and I can't help it. Which is really aggravating, because. I'm maybe not 5 anymore, sometimes? Oh well. I was trying to pysche myself out, almost as much for the corny ""I'm distracting you from the nasty needle"" jokes as anything else, when he surprised me by not being a total robot. There was no ""don't think about it"" etc. etc. And then he started thrusting the tissue box in my face to make me laugh. ....It. Sounds bad, maybe. But it was one of the nicest little things that's happened today, and it hasn't been a day particularly devoid of good people or times. thanks, turquoise-shirted male nurse man! (with a funny truck, as it happens)<br /><br />But briefly back to the money situation: I'm going to research it now, but does anyone know offhand about health insurance aid for minors [with limited means,etc]? ..in RI?<br /><br />Oh, right. Oops. The actual health part: TADA. they don't know. Surprise, surprise. I'm healthy, as far as they know. ...so something is actually wrong. Yay! They want to run tests starting with blood (pressure, irregularities, sugar, and the works) and a monitoring session in case I have minor heart mumurs or anything (runs in the family, but they're all tall...), also do some tests on whether I might be having a minor misconnect from brain to body, or a minor seizure (delish), also some delectable goodies with lots of synonyms and expensive CAT scans, and more needles, and more bloodwork. I want to take the friendly male nurse with me (for the life of me, I cannot remember his name. Oh dear.).&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm also undergoing 3 series for one shot, and 4 other shots besides as penance for the 2 years I have not been to the doctor. I'll go back in 2 months, and hopefully have the bloodwork done before then. Any questions? (heck yes.)<br /><br /><br />p.s. happy solstice, again :)<br />p.p.s tasty book aftertaste</p>"

That was what I was dreaming about. Only not so clearly divided, if you believe it. Believe it. Just trust me. If you think talking to me is tough, try the real thing sometime. It's not so bad, not really. Life is loverly, especially when one adds a ridiculous unnatural foreign dialect.

Not, oh my ap classes are done, oh, the seniors are gone, oh, just finals - fini.&nbsp;<br />The only course I have to think about is my Oils class at the art museum starting next week. aaand I'm souped.<br /><br />Oh, random throw-out to all those arty peoples, artisit of the&nbsp;week is &nbsp;Lucien Freud (yes, he's the grandson). Find a good website. Yes, he painted nude people, and lots of other things besides. and his paintings have this great depth to them, somehow.<br /><br />Dear Sewing Club to-be: I hope you are amazing.<br /><br />Dear Lifeguarding: Blahblahblah. I sincerely hope this works out all right, because summer is a favorite. p.s. If you make my life hell, I'll eat you.<br /><br />Staying up to 2 am reading a silly fluffy book for the first time in months? YES. Flashlight dying halfway through a very intenseee passage, definitely reminescent of 3rd grade.&nbsp;and even funny. Life is gooood again, kiddies.<br /><br />really, I apologize.

What difference does it make anyway? <br /><br />ap exams art show school people attitude issues personality college future career....... elipses. x^2 + y^2 ....<br /><br />Where do I want to go. where am I now. why am I. why am I here? Who are these people, and do they know? <br /><br />I know, in an ignorant fashion, that I absolutely despise existentialistic ramblings. Who am I, a figment, an undigested piece of watermelon in a group's collection imagination, a void? Who cares? Honestly. But yet I find myself stuck in this track of barely conscious awareness that only grants me access to the possible condition that I may not have a clue what's going on. This would be the cue for a crazy smart philosophy/art/language professor to move in next door and give me summer class on what. What? Everything. <br />Come on, world. You can do it.<br /><br />And good at? Comparitively, or does comparitively not matter? How do I know that's where I'll grow to, that if I go general, I'll compromise or I go specific, I'll become jaded, cliche and burnt out, or simply not good enough? Good enough for... Mom was wandering around the art show over my shoulder as we popped in this afternoon. And, according to her traditional penchant, she informed me of her opinions of everything. Which sometimes, is fine. But not when the artwork concerned is personal, and there are other moms and siblings wandering around as well, who neither want to hear a critique nor an argument disputing the quality of the piece. And I don't want to either. So I don't. And so I hear, Kevinkevinkevinbeautiful, talented. And that piece over there [I look]. It has such a lively quality to it. I like it much better than that [look] and that [sigh]. Yeah, that piece which the accident on it by a 1st grader compared to another piece by a kid in the same class with effort and learner's quality -but no exciting, completely incidental unintentional uninspired splat. Sigh. No one cares, but it wasn't as interesting to look at, she's right. And cartoony booby women are more fun to look at than say, paintings. Which she completely overlooked. That hurt. No, this time, in the weave of rhetoric, I'm serious, she didn't really care, at least not next to everything else. Not that I want obligatory parental devotion and relic-worship of every filial scribble, I don't. I'd like her to actually like what I do. But maybe they're not good, they're just...good. Yeah, ok, good. You have progressed and mastered this skill and that one, you are proficient, you pass, with honors. Yippee.<br /><br />I need to sleep before I put myself into a depressive coma. After all, we have delishious (yes, spelled like that) ineffective science exams tomorrow that will effect everyone except us. Word. And chorus practice with someone who scares me. No, not intimidates, per se. Not just varsie, and she means well (which is maybe scarier) but so, so many people who just.. wind up. Last year is when this really started kicking in. I was wondering when that stroke of self-directed divenation interest beam would boot up in my brain, and bam, one day, Turcotte (yet another) asks advisory what we want to do. Sam goes, ""oh, I know. I know. I'm going to be a nurse, or a teacher."" Bamwham straightcut, no ifs, queries, self doubts (and dare I say applicability?). We wonder where Sniffles-Freedman and The Fat Sub appear from. They must live in slimy slabs somewhere, or have grown up sans a large chunk of necessary brain-growing nutrients. But that isn't it. At all. Once upon a time, 14 year old Ms. Freedman decided she wanted to.. what? Was it confined to ""make babies"" or did she aspire to something else? She's not a good example, for whatever reason. People don't want to be classified that way; increasingly, people don't want to be classified. Except for wouldbemaybeare smarts. All of them. A whole room full at this college thing. Their eyes are all bright and interested though many have been doing (and acing) AP tests all week and get to go home late to more studying, they can picture their future, they identify with the bullets on the powerpoint. I perked up everytime a college mentioned interdisciplinary with relevence to art, which then made me slouch, remembering the afternoon. <br />I think I should've kept reading on my 2 books/day average from 6th grade, all the time. Maybe. But without any realworld inferences, you can't judge about what you're reading. Even reading utopian masters with buzz words and crowds and exclusion and humanity, we're all only drawings lines to the mindless idiots in connections math next door who would immediately begin laughing if someone poked their head in and said SEX really loudly. Except for that one kid in the corner. Who no one likes. Who would've been hurled off a cliff if they wore glasses are were surrounded by semi-nude boys running wild on an island? What?<br /><br />goodnight, folks.<br />p.s. on a lighter note, who has ideas for my hair from prom(s)? I think I want one style up, one down. So there's a lot to have fun with. I'll just be whiling away thinking too much. Yeah, seriously. <br /><br />p.p.s <font size=""5""><b>DANCE THIS SATURDAYYYYY<br />FENNER, 7-10:30</b></font> <br />&lt;3 <br /><br />Peace"

"event","<p>What a quick and exciting month... And beautious, by and large. That always deserves some mention.<br /><br />Neffa -- the last time we spoke, dear livejournal, I was bound for the glories of my favorite time, ever. The new location was just right, weather, sublime, people, hooray. There are many stories, quite a few of which I have already shared<br />I feel like I never quite catch up to myself, and that I should write things down, paint them, before they run away<br />I must, in fact. Because who knows, and because.... I enjoy it? Sounds good enough, little hedonist art freak, you.<br /><br />NYC Carnegie Hall&nbsp;<br />New Yoik is a giant scramble of everything, ever, as was this, a little. Dirt, the floors rumbling, the elevator squeaking, skanky employees being nasty, rolex impersonators, creativity, life, Central Park, pulse, people, pizza, sunshine, cherry blossoms --&nbsp;and did I mention the actual singing yet? Because, well. Dr. Armstrong was awesome [if rather square-shaped, of course] and Carnegie itself.. well. I've never been one really for the prestige of things simply because they are. It needs to prove itself. But sometimes, you're proven wrong. Something hangs around in the air and grace, and adds to the sheer size, acoustics, light, numbers, idea. In shoty, that was amazing. Standing up there where so many have, but that's not just it. This feeling of timelessness and dedication to an art, love of performance and excellence just flies out and swoops around, prancing and lurking and soaring. In a way. Since it is, in fact, an abstract segment of my imagination. But since when does that affect the impact or tangibility?&nbsp;<br />Also notable-<br />&nbsp;Ellis Island, which put me in two contrasting mindsets. The creepy feeling of being embued with the past, literally what makes you in the most physical way possible, walking through hospitalized tile passages and sunny arches, just searching for some trace of who you are, not who you will be. Just what happened, what they felt, how impossible some things seem. Steph cried, it's all so much more recent for her. Then again, Bri almost cried onstage at Carnegie. Dreams and hopes are weird, flitting creatures.&nbsp;The other mindset I hinted at was just a slight&nbsp;overtone to the awe and wonderment, caused largely by going to Croatia. Seeing living history like that, so old it boggles your mind if you truly try to comprehend how long it's been, in a range of your understanding. Watching people hang laundry out of a Roman ruin off an air conditioner unit puts our baby country in a newish light.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Spamalot -hahahahaha. Broadway theatres&nbsp; are small! Whichis nice. The set was fabulous (Ash, sorry, pics weren't allowed :( ) and the music and the lines and hahahaha. There's a reason every culture since ever has had entertainers.&nbsp;<br />Central Park - I wish we had spent more time there, it was so ... well, pretty is an obvious description. An oasis that reminds you it's all real. I very seriously needed that little glimpse into green, peace, actual life after being accosted by so many different people in different positions trying to lie to you, with no pride, no particular competence, no respect .. for anything. I was discouraged. Mostly because people didn't seem to care, at all. In there, there were kids, moms, scary middle-aged joggers, everything that brings you back to the fact. Later today I talked to dad, about NYC and growing up there. I guess I was just trying to understand how anyone could survive with such filth, issues, pretense and rudeness all the time, because I still wasn't quite settled. He said there's a lot more to it, which is what I was hoping. A city should be a center of things, and naturally, it'll have some crap, but the big city, sans art or any of the qualities I was ranting about above.. That's depressing. So Dad offered sometime to bring me (and possibly some friends) into the city for a day or two, and just explore a little, enjoy things, see some old friends, go to family-owned restaurants, crafters, music halls.. I think that would be good, for him and me. We'll see.<br /><br />Hoffenhooters, say what? Flying ice cubes, execrement jokes, sex jokes, race jokes, choral section jokes, themanonthebalcony... S'good.<br /><br />and now my dears, for the SATs, AP tests, and blahblahblahstandardizedblah! SIGH. </p><p>here's to spring, while I'm at it. peace &lt;3</p>"

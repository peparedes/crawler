Thanksgiving is tommorw wish I had more to be thankful for but, not this year... yes I might have my health ( not really ) my parents, milo and my friends, but I would do anything to be thankful for one thing that my cousin Jason was alive... but that true. I miss him so much, that it my heart hurts. Other things going on are my two friends want me to go out on the 30th but, I just don't feel like going out right now. One part of me wants to go but, am just not up to it and I don't have any money to go out right now. I told Beth this but, she doesn't get that I just don't want to go out this month. I don't want them to be mad at me it's just how I'm feeling right now. I might be getting a laptop tonight not sure yet might just go look."

Growin up my grammy always favored them over me and I was...the one with all of the problems. I was happy that I was the only one with a high school depoma. Jason and Eric change there lives around and I should have been happy for them. The last time I had since Jason was right before they moved. And my Aunt and Uncle gave me his address to his base but, I never got around to writing him . I guess I never thought he would get killed even thought I knew very much what going on over there. I have been try to get Eric's address...I guess I get it when I go to for Sept 1 . What is make me feel worse is that my friend Margaret who I thought was become my best friend again doesn't seem to understand that I am not the same person as I was before Jason was killed. I told her I didn't mean not to call her back and she said it was my lose and that she knows who her really friends are. I don't know what am going to do. Anyway my best friend Beth and her mom are taken me shoping today should be fun. Guess that is all for now got to go get my dad up."

And having a problem my one friend tx me back the other day ( "" whatever "" ) I told her I was sorry for missing her call and that I would give her a call the next day and that is what she tx back . My best friend says I shouldn't even go to her daugthers party ( she was with me at the time ) I don't know what to do . Because I had lost touch with her five years ago and I told her I would never do that again . The really reason I lost touch was because I didn't know how to tell at the time dating a 38 with a child and was married before was a bad idea and now he is the father of her daugther . And to make this even harder I have been thinking a lot about my cousin Jason. I miss him more then I thought I would I think that is way I want to do something for the 4th of July parade next year I feel like I owe it to myself and him for losing touch with him. Anyway guess that is all for now . Oh one more thing my mom's cat tiger might die because he ate some of his flee stuff I quess on time will tell but, he is not acting like himself."

Irwin Pulled Barb From Chest Before Death
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Fatally injured by a stingray, Australian ""Crocodile Hunter"" Steve Irwin pulled its serrated barb out of his chest before losing consciousness and dying, the world-famous naturalist's manager said on Tuesday.

Video footage of the attack shows Irwin swimming above the stingray on the Great Barrier Reef on Monday when it lashed out and speared him in the heart with its barbed tail, manager John Stainton told reporters.

""It shows that Steve came over the top of the ray and the tail came up, and spiked him here (in the chest),"" Stainton said after watching the footage.

""He pulled it out and the next minute he's gone. The cameraman had to shut down,"" he said.

""It's a very hard thing to watch because you're actually witnessing somebody die ... it's terrible.""

Irwin, 44, the quirky naturalist who won worldwide acclaim as TV's khaki-clad ""Crocodile Hunter,"" was filming a new documentary off Australia's northeastern coast when he was attacked.

Marine experts say stingrays can deliver horrific, agonizing injuries from the toxin-laden barbs, which can measure up to 20 cm (8 in) in length

It is so hard belive that he is not long here . He well be missed by so may people fans and his Family most of all .  I send my best out to his wife Terry and his two young children who he loved more then life it's self . He once said that he would give up this job when his two children were old enought to take over....If only he could be here when and if that we 
happen .

Tom & Katie Expecting a Baby
Tom Cruise's fiance, Katie Holmes, is pregnant with the couple's child, Cruise's spokesperson, Lee Anne DeVette, tells PEOPLE exclusively.
""Tom and Katie are very excited, and the entire family is very excited,"" says DeVette.

Cruise, who has two children, Connor, 10, and Isabella, 12, with ex-wife Nicole Kidman, began dating Holmes in mid-April. He proposed to her atop the Eiffel Tower in Paris in June. DeVette says there is no wedding date set.

DeVette would not comment on the baby's gender or say how far along the pregnancy is. The rep did say that Holmes, 26, ""has never felt better.""

Cruise, 43, is currently shooting Mission: Impossible 3 in Los Angeles."

And she then said to me you should talk I then said I know am Fat so what . Or it could be that I was talking to her Mom about what I have to do with my SSI check that I help pay bills . I not sure I just hope that it is that she has not had the time to call me ."

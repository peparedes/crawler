"event","Well today I had part one of my Precalculus final exam.  Today was the graphing part and I think I did really well.  I was kind of worried going into it but I think I did really well.  Tomorrow is the second part and it is 45 multiple choice questions and we can use a calculator.  That shouldn't be too bad.  I stayed after school for a little review session about tomorrow's test and it sounds pretty easy actually, so here's hoping.  The last thing I expected to happen when I walked out of school today happened.  When I was getting in my friends car who was taking me home, it began to snow.  Not much but still some flurries.  It had been really cold but I had no idea that there would be any precipitation that would cause snow at all.

When I got home I found out that my cousin wasn't coming for math tutoring today which I do weekly.  It was kind of a relief because I have more time to spare tonight.  Currently I'm playing Kingdom Hearts: Chain of  Memories which I can nearing the end for.  I will play a bit and then study some for my math exam tomorrow.  American Idol is also on from 8:00-9:00 PM so I will watch that as well.  Every other year I watched the entire season but this year I am gonna stop after the auditions I think.  If I can fit it in I will watch some more Cowboy Bebop tonight if I can.  I am up to episode 7 now.  Need to watch more of it if I can.  I have one other exam tomorrow but nothing I can really study for.  It's an exam for my SAT/ACT Prep class.  It will be two math sections which should be a breeze for me.  I'm actually taking the real SAT on Saturday so I hope my SAT/ACT Prep class has prepared me well.  Today I am a little more relieved about exams than I was in the past few days, so I hope I will be well rested for the SAT.  Well that is it for now."

"event","I really hadn't planned on returning to this because I would always get
behind on it, but a friend reminded me of it today and I decided I
would start updating again. Well yesterday I had two friends come over
to my house. We played Halo 2, watched Harold and Kumar Go To White
Castle on DVD that I bought, and then watched one of my friend's Aqua
Teen Hunger Force DVD's. One of my friends left and the other slept
over at my house. We just played some games like Star Wars: Jedi
Outcast, Star Wars: Battlefront, and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.
My friend and I beat Metal Gear Solid 3 today after playing it all
night mostly. He just left a few hours ago and I played Kingdom Hearts:
Chain of Memories up until about 30 minutes ago. I am in Riku's story
now after completing Sora's storyline last night when my friend was on
my computer. Now I am watching some TV and then I will be playing some
more Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories most likely. Also I would like
to get around to starting to watch my Cowboy Bebop VCD's again and try
to finish them sometime in the next week or so. I most likely won't
have much time to do any other stuff this week because I have exams on
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Then I will be switching classes for
the new semester. Here's hoping I do well on exams this week. I'm
hoping not to stress too much over them."

"event","Well a little later then I expected to update tonight.  I got really into Final Fantasy IX and played all night.  I finally got through disc 1.  I lied kinda.  I will only go over my school day tonight and then I will review the past week tomorrow, or actually later today.  

Well I started with Pre-Calculus Honors and it sounds pretty hard.  I always make high A's in math but the teacher said even those people may struggle.  Today we had a 1 hour delay because of Tropical Storm Gaston so we only got about an hour in 1st block.  We only went over class rules and such.  I knew the teacher because of a math competition team I went with last year at a local college and she was the person who took us.

2nd block was SAT/ACT Prep.  I knew the teacher through Academic Team which I am on.  The class seems pretty easy.  Mostly the only tests will be on vocabulary.  She says she doesn't give homework except for what people don't finish in class.  It should be pretty good overall.

3rd block was Integrated Business Applications(an advanced Keyboarding course where you learn programs and such).  We had a substitute in there because the teacher's little baby was sick so she had to take the baby to the doctor.  We had like nothing to do.  All we had to do was a 5 slide Powerpoint which took me like 10 minutes.  I just checked on some sport's team websites and such after I finished.  About 45 minutes in we had lunch.  It lasted 30 minutes.  I got a piece of pizza, a bag of Doritos and a Cherry Coke.  I have some friends in that lunch period so I was happy.  We then went back to 3rd block and I surfed the web some more.  

Lastly I had Chemistry.  I had this teacher for Physical Science at first last year and then the whole class got switched out so she could teach chemistry.  We went over classroom rules and then did 2 Periodic Table worksheets.  They were so easy.

Overall my day was pretty decent.  Better than most first days.  As I said I'll review the past week after school today.  Time to go watch some Adult Swim.  After Case Closed and Lupin III I'm going to bed.  The school day sure did tire me out since I haven't done it all summer."

I will update about the past week and tomorrow's school day sometime tomorrow.  Well I'm off to bed.  I so wish school wasn't starting."

"event","I've been so busy the past week.  I haven't updated since last Saturday and I've done a lot so prepare for a long post.  Well last Sunday I just did different things around the house including playing Ninja Gaiden and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.  

Then Monday I went to my friend Isaac's.  Before that though my morphers finally came in the mail.  I wore the Drago morpher the entire time and my friend wore the Thundersaurus morpher with the Dimetro and Parasaur faceplates.  We played both games some and did other stuff such as watch a few Power Rangers In Space episodes.  We only watched like 2.  The Delta Discovery and The Great Evilyzer.  I went home on Tuesday and just had some other things to do around the house.  

On Wednesday I went to another friend's house around 1 PM for a sleepover.  Two others came but they had to come later.  I started off by beating him at NCAA Football with my favorite team, the University of South Carolina Gamecocks, when he used Virginia Tech.  Then we played Halo which I dominated when it involved Ghosts and Tanks.  After doing that basically all day the other two came over around 7 PM and we ate pizza for dinner and played more games until about 2 AM.  Then we watched American Pie 1 which I rented and took over.  Hilarious movie.  One was ready to go to bed so he did on the sofa and the other two wanted to go play the computer game Red Alert on his computer.  I didn't want to and wasn't ready to go to bed so I went back to the living room and watched TV.  I watched Case Closed on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network which is one of my favorite new shows as well as Lupin The III which I started to watch after but I fell asleep about half way through it.  We woke up at about 10:30 AM and the first one left.  Then my mom calls and said she has to pick me up at about 11:45 AM instead of 1:00 PM.  I got home and just played games and did much of nothing.

Later that night I watched the Carolina Panthers preseason game against the New York Giants.  We pretty much destroyed them for the most part and would have annihilated them if we hadn't changed QB's like we did since they do that a lot in preseason games.  After the game I packed my bags for the trip the next day to Columbia, SC for the American Idol Season 3 Tour Show and school shopping.

I woke up at about 10:00 AM and got ready to go quickly and we left around 11:30 AM.  In the car I used the new portable DVD player we got to watch Power Rangers Wild Force VCD's I have.  I was up to episode 12 before then.  On the way up there I got to about episode 18.  The trip was only about 2 and a half hours.  We got to the Embassy Suites hotel around 2 PM and just sat around and rested until about 4:30.  During that time I watched Wild Force episodes up to about 21.  At that point we left the hotel and went to the Colonial Center where the American Idol Season 3 Tour concert was.  We walked around the inside of the place a bit and then went and we got hamburgers at a food place in there and we went to the souvenir stand  I got a shirt that says ""Seacrest Out"" on it from American Idol.  My sister got a shirt as well.  We also got a poster with all the Idols on it.  We then went and sat down in our seats which were in the 15th row center so we were very close.  We got in our seats around 6:15 PM and the show started around 7:00 PM.  The concert was superb.  They each sang one song alone except for Diana and Fantasia who each sang 2 for the first half.  Then there was a short intermission and it started back.  They did duets, group songs and such the second half.  They did ones such as a Prince Medley to ""Hey Ya"" by Outkast.  We then left the concert when it ended and went to the Waffle House right next to the hotel and ate.  It was very good.  We then went to the hotel and went to sleep.    

We woke up Saturday morning at about 9:30 AM and went and ate the complimentary breakfast at the hotel.  At about 11:30 AM we left and went school shopping.  My mom took me shopping first.  We went to Old Navy where I found a lot of stuff.  We also went to JC Penney to get me a pair of denim shorts but they had no good pairs.  It only took us about an hour.  We then met back up with my dad and sister and my mom took my sister shopping.  My dad and I looked around for about 30 minutes and then went to the movie and saw Without A Paddle which was very funny.  After the movie my dad and I looked around some more since my mom and sister wern't done yet.  We met back up around 5 PM in the mall.  My parents let me get a really nice Carolina Panthers jersey.  It was an official NFL jersey of the quarterback Jake Delhomme.  It cost $65.  After that we left the mall and went back to the hotel and rested.  We left there around 8 PM and went and ate at a great steak place called the Texas Roadhouse.  We then went back to the hotel and ordered the movie Elf off of the Pay-per-piew thing they offer.  Really good movie but weird to watch when it isn't Christmas time.  It's really cool because it's not even out on DVD yet.  After that went off a little after midnight I watched about 3 more Wild Force episodes taking me up to 24.  I then went to sleep.

We slept a little later this past morning.  We were very tired so we slept through breakfast until around 10:30 and decided to just get lunch on the way home.  We got everything together and left for home around noon.  We stopped at a Wendy's on the way home and ate lunch.  On the way home I watched more Wild Force and got up to episode 30.  When I got home I just got on my computer and did different things.  Then I watched the Atlanta Braves baseball game with my dad which we won 10-1 I believe.  fter the game my sister came and watched the new Power Rangers DinoThunder episode ""Disappearing Act"" from Saturday that I missed and they were showing it for the first time on Toon Disney.  It was a pretty good episode.  Tommy finally demorphed but now he is invisible.  A little later we watched the movie Smokey and the Bandit on DVD.  I had never seen it before tonight.  Very funny movie.  After that I came to my room and watched some of Adult Swim through 12:30 AM including Family Guy and Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  After that I watched some Wild Force episodes up through 34.  After I finished that episode I figured I better update my journal and I've been writing this for a long time.  I hope to update more often this week.  School starts next Monday so I hope this week goes by very slow.  I need to finish this because I'm tired and I need to go to sleep."

"event","Well today wasn't the greatest of days that is for sure.  Well I was up pretty late last night, close to 5 AM watching the Kamen Rider Faiz Movie Paradise Lost, which I must say was superb.  Just watching it makes me want to watch the entire Faiz series again.  Since I was up so late I slept to about 10:30 or so I believe.  I had finished my school paper last night but I had to add bibliographic info about the articles I had to find relating to the books.  So I had to do that first just to get it out of the way.  Since its due Monday for extra credit and if we lose power from Hurricane Charley I could not finish it.  

After I did that I pretty much just watched the weather closely as I cleaned my room.  My sister was suppose to go to a sleepover that we took her over to and said we would watch the weather to see if she could stay and spend the night and was planning on getting her around 11 or 12 tonight.  After we dropped her off my mom and I went to Blockbuster and rented me a few games if we lost cable and had power so I'd have something to do.  I rented Ninja Gaiden and Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic for Xbox.  I also got one of the Yu-gi-oh! exclusive card packs for the movie that always comes with the same 8 cards.  There are Three 10 star monsters in there so its definitely worth it since it was only $3.99.  We also rented American Pie since I've never seen the first one.  I've only seen the Third, which I enjoyed very much.  They had a deal where you could buy 2 previously owned movies for $20 and we took advantage of it by getting 50 First Dates and Mystic River.  Its only like $5 more per movie then to just rent it.  While we were doing that my dad was at Lowes getting some supplies for the storm such as flashlights, betteries, etc.  

Well my day was getting a little better at that point.  Then when my mom and I got home we had a message from our neighbor saying to call her.  When we did she told us a friend of hers thats a high ranked National Guardsman called her and told her that he had been in the Governor's office all day and they think that Hurricane Charley will slam right into the county where I live.  We live a bit inland but not too far.  Soon after that the South Carolina, where I live, ordered a mandatory evacuation for the part of our county closest to the ocean.  My family and I aren't included in that thankfully.  Now we just wait and see what will happen.  They expect it to be either a Category 1 Hurricane or possibly a minimal Category 2 Hurricane.  I am hoping it is not the the latter.  They say it will probably make landfall at about 2 PM EST tomorrow.  I thought this day was bad with the worrying of where it will go.  Now for later today I have to worry about it actually hitting us, hence the title of my post Two Days of Friday the 13th.  We are going to probably start boarding up our house at 6 AM this morning if we see we should.  Right now its looking like we will need too.  I probably won't be sleeping anyways.  On top of keeping up with the weather, I better get in my gaming time before we may lose power.  The other bad thing is later today in the mail my DinoThunder morphers are suppose to come and I hope this storm doesn't prevent this.  Pretty much yesterday(since its after midnight) was hell and later today will be total hell.  I'm just hoping those possible 90 MPH winds don't happen here which they said might happen.  

I'm hoping I will have power and internet to be able to post again tomorrow after the storm.  OK well thats all for now.  I'm going to go play Ninja Gaiden some.  Such a hard game.  Heres hoping everything goes ok.  Good luck for everyone else in the path of Hurricane Charley as well."

"event","Well I got home Wednesday and have been too busy to post since I have been finiushing up my school paper for summe reading due this coming Monday if I want extra credit.  I didn't really keep up with the weather much when I was at my friend's lake house.  Then when I got home I hear there are two Tropical Systems.  Tropical Storm Bonnie and Hurricane Charley.  I just thought they were hitting Florida and then would dissolve either over land and never reach South Carolina where I live.  I wake up this morning to find out that both will affect my area.  they just didn't know how badly.  As I type this now Bonnie which is now a Tropical Depression is here and is mostly rain for now.  After that Hurricane Charley will be hitting us sometime Saturday.  No one knows how strong it will be or how it will affect here.  It depends on whether it stays inland as it comes this way or goes over the ocean at the Georgia coast and re-enters South Carolina.  If that happens it can strenthen even more.  

OK enough with the bad news.  The other day I won an auction on Ebay for the three Power Rangers DinoThunder morphers.  I haven't owned any morphers since the days of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers really.  I always wanted to but never did.  They shipped early today priority mail.  So they will be here Saturday hopefully.  In my friend and I's Power Ranger Episode-a-thon we eventually got through Power Rangers Turbo and then the first 8 episodes of Power Rangers In Space before I left yesterday.  He is coming home tomorrow so we can continue the episode-a-thon hopefully.  My mom went and got me yesterday because originally my friend was staying until Saturday or Sunday plus my friend's parents wanted my parents to see their lake house.  My dad couldn't go because of work.  They decided today to go ahead and come home tomorrow because of Hurricane Charley.  It is only a hour and a half drive away so not too far.  

Now I'm just sitting here watching Lupin The III on Adult Swim.  Such a good show.  I'm not tired one bit right now.  I'm planning on going to watch the Kamen Rider Faiz movie Paradise Lost after Lupin goes off.  I better go ahead and wrap this up.  It's getting to be very long.  Lastly this picture below is the result of a quiz I took that shows your favorite Red Power Ranger.

"event","Well right now I'm at my friends lake house until Wednesday.  We have been outside most of the time.  We have swam in the lake, gone on a boat ride, etc.  Last night we had another Power Ranger episode-a-thon.  We skipped from the finale of MMPR season 3 to Turbo because we had already watched a lot of Zeo.  We skipped some eps and we are up to Passing the Torch Part 2 and will continue tonight.  We have no cable in the bedroom so we just watch the eps.  We are right now watching an old tape of Fox Kids shows from 1994 including the Power Ranger episode Return of an Old Friend Part 2 in its original showing and two Batman The Animated Series episodes.  Now the episode Wheel of Misfortune is on.  Well I gotta finish this off.  I may post later tonight."

We pretty much did nothing but play Psi-ops for Playstation 2(which we beat), watch Hellboy, and watch TV.  Then Tuesday night I went to his house and we did nothing but watch MMPR Season 3 episodes and be on his laptop.  We watched all of the big plot developing multiparter episodes in it starting with A Freiend In Need.  We made it all the way to Master Vile and the Metallic Armor.  All great episodes.  I came home and worked on my Summer Reading paper about the books 1984 and Brave New World.  I am hoping to get another 1/3 done tomorrow and then get the last 1/3 done Friday.  If I turn it in by August 15th I get extra credit.  Today I just found out how to play Halo online which is beyond awesome.  I've played a few matches but I sadly lost.  I'm currently watching The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn.  When it goes off around 1:35 I'm gonna play a few rounds of online Halo and then I will get to Final Fantasy IX for a few hours and then go to bed.  Well I'm gonna go ahead and finish this up.  5 Questions is on now on Craig Kilborn.  I'll try to make another post later today."

"event","Well sorry for the lack of updates lately.  I've been very busy.  Hanging out with friends and such.  I saw Spider-man 2 again Thursday night.  It was as good as the first time.  One thing is I noticed they actually tried to make it look like his webbing hit the building when webswinging instead of just going into the sky like everyone has always complained about Spider-man.  Well last night my parents went to a party of one of my best friend's parents, but my friend was out of town so I just stayed home.  I ended up going to one of my other best friends house across the street.  I had invited him to come over here, but his mom and stepdad went out and he had to babysit his stepbrother.  I slept in this morning because I was up until about 4 AM last night because I couldn't sleep, but I had a tape record the new Power Rangers DinoThunder episode A Ranger Exclusive.  Great episode.  The episode this July of DinoThunder have all been superb.  Especially last weeks and this weeks.  I can't believe they actually continued Ethan and Cassidy's relationship.  After that I just did some computer things for a while and chatted with some people on AIM.  Later in the day my family went to Sam's Club and I bought a DVD double pack with Hellboy and Resident Evil for only $25.  I saw Hellboy in theaters but I have never seen Resident Evil.  I really want to see it because I know the sequel is coming out in theaters soon.  Then we went to a local seafood restaurant for dinner and went by Krispy Kreme after to get donuts and we brought them home.  Both the dinner and dessert were very good.  Now nothing is on TV so I just have my TV left on MTV Hits.  They are showing newer music videos by a singer and then an older one or vice versa.  Really interesting to see the changes in the people over the years.  Well I'm off bed soon.  I need my rest so I can try to finish my summer reading book Brave New World tomorrow.  If not tomorrow then Monday at the latest.  Well I'm off."

I had seen it but he missed it because he was out of town.  Pretty soon I need to start getting ready because I am going to the theater to see Spider-man 2 again with a few friends.  Spider-man 2 is a great movie.  I wanted to see it at the IMAX theater but my local one isn't showing it yet.  I may play NCAA Football 2005 for XBOX a bit inbetween getting ready and leaving.  Well   I may update later tonight.  I will have to be starting my other summer reading book Brave New World tonight so I will have to see if I can make another entry or not."

I never got around to any last night so I'm still up to The Alien Costume story arc.  Right now I'm watching Family Guy on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network.  Family Guy is so funny.  This week they are showing the best episodes chosen by the series creator Seth McFarlane.  I'm still suppose to be going to a friends tomorrow night to sleepover and hang out.  We will plays games.  Him and I may have a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers episode a thon.  Starting where we left off at about ep 10 of season 2.  We may watch some Kamen Rider Faiz too.  I really need to introduce him to Yu Yu Hakusho.  Well as I finish typing this Family Guy is going off so I better end this so I can go finish the book 1984 before I fall asleep.

It's a pretty good book.  I needed a break from it so I created this and am making this entry.  I'm gonna read a bit more then get to bed.  I don't wanna sleep too late in the morning.  I have no idea what I have planned for later on this day at this time for sure.  I may go to the IMAX theater and see Spider-man 2 with a friend.  It will be the second time for me seeing the movie.  This time it will be even better though because it will be on an even bigger screen.  Maybe I should just go ahead and finish my book tomorrow and go to sleep now.  At least go ahead and lay down.  Might put on a VCD of the 90's Spider-man series.  I'm up to the Alien Costume episodes where Venom was introduced.  I'm about to fall asleep on the keyboard as I write this so I'm gonna go lay down.  I'll update this more later today after I wake up."

alan is amazing. <3

star wars kicked ALL KINDS of ass.  totally worth the two hour wait and dorky feelings in the theater last night haha.  we left austin at like 9pm....got to san marcos about 930.  stood in the huge ass line for about 10 minutes and then they let us in the theater at about 10.  we played spider solitaire on alan's sidekick for a while...did some crossword puzzles and cheated (robert SHAW played in jaws...sheesh)....then midnight FINALLY rolled around and the movie started...and the music...i thought there were going to be some cardiac arrests...for sure.

good times.  i love my new san marcos friends aww.

alexandra left me yesterday.  i miss her face already :(

alright, fuck it....i'm going back to lounging around.  this is too much work for me. hahahhaha how sad.  kisses for my many lovers!!!!!!!

Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
But you won't
No you won't
Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

I'll close my eyes
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight!

Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
But you won't
No you won't
Cause I can't make you love me....if you don't"

"event","i have bell's palsy.

the left side of my face is temporarily paralyzed hahahaha.  it's completely scary and totally hilarious.

i had some terrible sinuses..which caused an ear infection..which caused my ear drum to rupture..which caused the facial nerves that go through the inner ear canal to get all fucked up.  so now my smile is all crooked and it's hard to close my left eye for real.

it's quite embarrassing actually.  i don't think i'll be leaving my room for a while haha.  and on top of all that shit, i have an eye infection on that side too.  i am totally falling apart.  and yes, in case you were wondering..it DOES suck.  lots of ass.

if anything else goes wrong on the left side of my face, i will let you guys know.  but i don't know if there is any space left on it that is NOT fucked up right now.  i hate bell's palsy.  and eye infections.  and you.

ha haaa not really.  i love.

sorry to whine about all that.  i'm really in a worse mood than this entry lets on.  boy troubles and whatnot.  but it's not their fault..it's all mine really.  well i suppose maybe some of it can be blamed on the ONE.  he and i are both just stupid idiots who can't move on from each other, and we apparently find some kind of sick joy in making ourselves miserable.  yaaaaay!  but derek on the other hand..is absolutely wonderful.  amazing even.  so that's enough to keep me going.  :)"

so, i get on the UT bus today to go to school.  and we stop on lakeshore to pick up more people.  and one of these people is this kid who gets on every MWF at 1230, which is when i'm going to my ancient rome class.  and he has an artificial right leg.  and every fucking time he gets on, the bus driver takes off too early and he falls down, sometimes into a seat if he's lucky.

it pisses me off beyond anything every time and ruins my day from there on out.

why can't people pay more attention to each other and just FUCKING BE DECENT PEOPLE.

i'm not fucking stupid.

can somebody tell me when the hell i turned into a stupid ass?

FUCK.

this shit has to go away.  i can't let these feelings just sit there.  it's fucking ridiculous, i tell you!

i wish i could just let my fears go, and let myself feel how wonderful i know it could be, but i'm too smart for this!

and that reminds me of a song, boys and girls...

-------------------------------------------------------
Don't stray, don't ever go away 
I should be much too smart for this 
You know it gets the better of me sometimes
When you and I collide
I fall into an ocean of you
Pull me out in time, don't let me drown 
Let me down
I say it's all because of you
And here I go, losing my control 
I'm practicing your name
So I can say it to your face
It doesn't seem right to look you in the eye 
And let all the things you mean to me 
Come tumbling out my mouth
Indeed it's time, tell you why 
I say it's infinitely true

Say you'll stay 
Don't come and go 
Like you do 
Sway my way 
Yeah I need to know 
All about you

And there's no cure, and no way to be sure 
Why everything's turned inside out 
Instilling so much doubt 
It makes me so tired; I feel so uninspired 
My head is battling with my heart 
My logic has been torn apart 
And now it all turns sour 
Come sweeten every afternoon

Say you'll stay 
Don't come and go 
Like you do 
Sway my way 
Yeah I need to know 
All about you

ugh.

fuck this.

"event","well hello there, my lovers.

just sitting here at the ol apartment on a sunday night.  putting off reading my book about religion in ancient rome.  we really need to tone down the excitement in here, boys and girls.

so yeah.  i'm writing a lot tonight.

last night was fucking...incredible.  haha incredibly amazing.  amazingly superb.  yeah i had a good time, can you tell?  and i'm not the only one, baby..hahhah.

the show was fantastic.  plinko and the guest opened for the burden brothers.  i really love the guest.  they're bad ass, for serious.  and rose surprised me with her presence and i was SO excited!  she had told me earlier that she wouldn't be able to make it.  then it worked out to where she could, and she told craig not to tell me because she wanted to surprise me at the show.  but then when we got to the venue, we ran into the guys and i was talking to casey and he's like ""yeah, well rose is downstairs, so we're going to run to the hotel..we'll be back at like 1030.""  i was like WHATTTT hahaha, so casey ruined the secrets.  oh well, poor little bronco..he didn't know any better.

so the boys show back up during the guest's set.  we called corey over to look at his newly pierced nose and then find out that he got a tattoo that day as well.  and taz's new tattoo was my favorite.  it's a mosquito on his arm and it says ""suck it"" underneath it hahaha.  aww and tazzy's daddy was there!  that was kinda weird and awesome at the same time.

so they go on.  they opened with ""god damn beautiful"" which is always a treat.  the crowd goes insane on that one.  because it's hot.  they played everything i wanted to hear.  my favorites ""she's not home"" ""conditional"" ""stay with me"" (hell yeah, rod stewart!), ""walk all over you"" and of course they closed with ""dirty sanchez.""  wonderful....

hanging out afterwards was a blast, as always.  great conversation with rich and my love casey hess backstage.  then we all sang a wonderful song in the dressing room for john jansky hahahahhah.  and of course, everyone got to see corey's white ass.  vaden was traumatized..like he's never seen it pssh.  then taz, hess and corey all made out together.  it was so hot.  hahahahah..

then it was my turn.  making out on the sidewalk of a small town square under a streetlight on a cold, rainy night.  does it get any hotter?  i submit that it does not.  you understand if you know who it was i was making out with.  gaaaah.  and if you don't..sorry, you're missing out haha.  that is all i have to say about that. wait, mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  okay, NOW that is all.

and the night only got better from there.  who knew?!

well it's about that time.  i should get back to reading.  i love learning!

and i love you too.  and you and you and you.  but not so much you.  you, i can do without. <333"

how are things with everyone

been a while..again.  get over it.

tonight's not going to be a happy entry.  but it's not sad either, so don't fret.  i'm doing fine, but things are just blah for me right now.

first of all, i'm sick as hell.  i don't know what's wrong with me, but my lymph nodes in my neck are like apples and i can barely swallow anything.  blah

secondly, i'm confused as hell.  i thought i had everything figured out, and i knew where i stood..but then i learned some things, and i had some conversations.  now i'm even more confused.  last night, he told me that girls are confusing and live for drama, and guys are straightforward.  a little ironic, considering i'm the one who will actually come out and say what i want and feel, and he's the one stuck in a soap opera of a relationship.  hmmmm

don't you just hate it when you're ""this amazing, amazing girl...but you live in austin, and you can't even get into a baaaar.""  because that is like the ultimate for me.  i love it <33333  haha who can tell when i'm being bitter?  yes, you win!

isn't that bullshit.

meh it's okay haha.

i'm still here.  and i have much love for everyone!  yes, even that damn big-nosed (<--for andy), chicken-legged, giggling, wristband-wearing, guitar-smashing, sweet, gorgeous idiot.  gaah.  things i would say if i could:

either make up your mind now, or leave me alone until you have.
try telling ME those things..i know telling kristi pretty much guarantees i'll hear it hahah but still...
she's crazy and ridiculous..i'm not..therefore i win

dude.  that felt like nothing.  now if i can just bring myself to say them out loud.  then maybe out loud to him.  ARGH

this entry is so gay.  hahaha i feel like this is my first whiny livejournal.  i don't know why everyone does it, it's not so great.  now i just feel angry and confused again.  blah i guess i'll do some math homework.

don't forget to miss me

love to you and you and you and you and you...oh yeah and you.

sorry if i missed anyone.

"event","Blah.  Today is very boring, but it's okay because I don't really feel like doing anything.  I stayed home and watched some Olympic swimming with my Mommy because I love her so.

Last night was fun I guess.  We went to Matt's house and I got to see my loves Ashley and Lori!  I haven't seen those girls all summer, except once I saw Lori in the Target parking lot haha.  Also got to see Squash Camp, Dusty Hardy, Houstie, and Mega Monk.  We went night-walking in Fisher's Landing and I think Ashley was drunk or high off of the brownies haha.  Not really, but that would be quite a sight.  Oh and I'm still mad that I left my backwards/sideways trucker hat with my initials on it at home, otherwise I would have fit right in and that would have been so damn cool.  Haha I love it.  Then we got bored and went to Phillie Cheese Steak's house to watch the boys play poker.  Me and Jenn are the official cheerleaders (also the only girls ever) at Phil's Poker Nights haha.  After the poker got boring, me, Jenn, Andresicus and Justie went to Justie's house to play Nintendo and listen to Jimmy Eat World haha.  Some top-level secrets were disclosed, but it's okay.  It was a pretty laid-back night but all in all it was good times once again.

I got new sheets and new bath stuffs for my new apartment, thanks to my magnificent, marvelous, Great Aunt Jane.  I am way excited and I need to be able to move in today.  I want to go see Jesse and Jeremy and James's new place..I hear it's awesome, but I will have to decide for myself.  Jenn is under oath now that she's going to come visit me in Austin ASAP..we will have crazy times I swear it.  I keep seeing people I haven't seen in so long and it's making me sad that I'm leaving, but I know I will see them again at least this semester.  And I'd like to think that we won't, but I know we will steadily drop off after that.  SBartz is like 30 minutes away, Dusty and Squash are each only like 45 minutes away, and The Aggie Crew is like an hour and a half away but that's kind of far.  Blah I hope we don't all drift apart too soon.

Oh well enough complaining..it's a happy day.  Happy Days are yours and mine, Happy Days!  Alright well I'm gonna go eat some chicken salad because it is scrumptious haha that was for Jenn.  There may also be some morsels involved, but I'll get back to you on that.  Love!"

Tonight was pretty fun.  I went to Galveston with Jenn, Kristi and Doctor Dre.  We drove around so long trying to figure out a place to eat that everything closed and we had to freakin go to Waffle House.  That's okay though because I had my lovely hashbrowns (scattered, covered, and chunked) mmm.  I am so full I could go all day tomorrow without eating again haha.  I almost got a tattoo also.  I've finally decided what I want.  I want a little heart colored in like the Texas flag, aww it's going to be beautiful.  Me and Kristi almost got attacked by a creepy crowd outside JuJu's.  I have never been eye-raped by so many people at once.  I was scared for my life haha.  I'm glad we didn't pretend to be lesbians like Jenn and Andy wanted us to, haha we would definitely be dead right now.  Despite being almost killed by the crowd and by Kristi's driving, it was a pretty fun night.

I don't have much on the schedule for tomorrow.  I guess I'll hang out with Mammy Chammy.  She seems lonely lately because everyone's leaving.  Scott's in California for like a week, Jesse never comes home, and I'm about to move to Austin so she's having a lot of abandonment problems.  Everytime I leave the house she tells me how much she loves me and to be careful like 3487 times.  I hate seeing her like that and it makes me not want to leave her, but I know she wants me to and she wants me to be happy up there so I pretend not to notice that she cries when I leave.  It breaks my heart, but I probably don't know half of what she goes through with all this.  Okay that's enough sadness.

I move in in a week..next Friday.  I'm so scared and excited, it's crazy.  I have to start deciding what all to take (as in clothes and crap).  I've decided that I have way too much stuff.  Jesse and Jeremy signed their lease for their house on campus today.  I am so excited for them..and I will be hanging out there between classes and stuff so get ready boys haha.  AHH I can't wait to move..it's going to be wonderful until I get lonely and start making phone calls begging people to drive 3 hours from Baytown to come visit me!  But it's worth the trip, I promise hahaha.

Anyway, I'm gonna go and quit dropping hints to everyone to come visit me (nudge, nudge).  Haha alrighty goodnight..I love you!"

We have to get the Burban inspected, get my driver's license renewed (from last November haha) and then I have to pay my speeding ticket which is $175 jeeeeez. I suppose I should start packing up my life pretty soon, I move in to my apartment in like 10 days. I can't even express how scared I am of what's to come in the next few months. I'll be okay though..at least I know SOME people up there..some being like four.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Enough whining from me. I had lots of fun at Payton's last night. Me and Jenn especially enjoyed our quality time in the kitchen with Paytie. Oh and the fun Matt and I had watching the BB Gun Contest at Dusty's house is going to be hard to beat. Haha I'm kidding of course. Yay, I'm excited that Paytie Poo is going to Monroe with us. He will mos def enjoy the show, or I will kick him in the face. Haha but I'm sure it won't come to that because the Boys are awesome and they never disappoint.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Okay well I'm tired of doing this so I'm gonna go watch some TV. Goodnight all. I love you!</P>"

"event","Blah..I just got out of the shower and I don't want to dry my hair.  Ah well, it has to be done.  I'm going to pick up the Jenn at Alpha so we can head off to THE LOFT and get ourselves hoed up in the proper environment.  Pretty excited about the show tonight.  I haven't seen Marcy Died Twice in like 353 years.  Something like that.  Oh and we're not getting there at 7:30, I don't care what Dr. Dre says.

Hmmmmmmm what else.  Ah yes, I am very excited that Spencer, as well as Justin my love, will be joining me up at the University of Texas next year.  At least those are the plans for now.  I am SOOO pumped to move in to my new apartment.  I get free tanning and free DVD rentals out of the front office...I heard that and I was done haha.  Not really..they really are like the nicest apartments in that area, which is like the student apartment megaplex off of Riverside Drive haha.

HAHAHA I just remembered this from last night.
Me: (at Luna's trying to order food) ""Andy, what the hell do you want?""
Andy: (with his napkin tied around his face like a bandito) ""Enchiladas.....and all your money!""

Hahaha good times.  I hope Justin and Brent enjoyed those quesadillas..they were gone in like 2.01 seconds.  Well now I must go dry the hair because it is almost dry on its own and that is NO good haha.  Later lovelies."

"event","Wow I think I may be the last person on the planet to get a livejournal.

I suppose you could call me a late bloomer or a lazy bum, but that would make you (respectively) obnoxious or rude...but probably correct either way.

Anyhow, today was quite uneventful.  I slept until 1:45 which was completely accidental, but not entirely out of character.  Me and Spencer were supposed to go get our licenses renewed, but we both slept too late and we are both WAY too lazy haha.

Soo, I am moving to Austin for college in a little over two weeks, and I could not be more excited or scared.  My parents think I'm never going to go to class--not without reason, I'll admit..I hardly ever went to class in high school haha.  My new apartment is so awesome and I already love it even though I've never seen it--only the model.  Everyone needs to take a road trip to Austin this semester and visit me!  If you want to have a good time, you know I will not disappoint.  Hmm that made me sound like a hooker.  Whatever.

I am so excited about this Friday because I will get to see my favorite band named after Andy's mom in the entire world--Marcy Died Twice!  Justin Mac is my best friend even though he hated me when he moved here; Chase Mal has red hair and that makes him cool; Houstonia is the best because he dedicated ""Tyler"" to me the other night haha; and Paytie Pie is crazy to the max and I love it.  Yay boys!  Speaking of shows..I'm also way excited about the next Burden Brothers show which is like 3 weeks away.  Aw I miss those boys.

ANYway, I guess I'm going to go because I'm tired of thinking up random things to talk about.  I love you!"

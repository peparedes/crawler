"event","Its so weird to come home and expect someone that has been part of your life for the past 14 years to be some where around the house, only to realize that you will never see them again.  Even Buddy seems to be in a somber mood... its odd but I think even though he's just a dog, he realizes what has happened. Soon Buddy will go back to live with Brian and there wont be any pets except for fish in the Manno household. screw the fish.  I dont care about them. I wish dogs aged like humans.  Mom mentioned about maybe getting a new dog in a few monthes, maybe a small english bull dog or something.  But not for a few monthes... mom thinks it would be rude to get a new dog too quick. I've been preparing myseld for this day, but i cried yesterday when i found out it was going to happen, said my goodbyes before I went to Jeffs. I know its only human to cry...and there will never be enough ""preparation"" for something like this.  it sucks."

"event","Ok so...  last i wrote i was getting my tattoo-- well its been on my back for a few months now and i still like it.  anyways. tomorrow will be 7 months with Jeff.  seems longer, in a good way.  things are going really good.  everyday with him my feelings just intensify and i find new reasons i love him.  Oh yeah,  I have a job. ha.  I sent out over 30 applications, went on two interviews and got a job with the first one. Funny thing is, I got a job I didnt even apply for. I applied for K-5 special ed, and wound up being offered Autistic Preschool even though I have no experience.  I have been going in the past 2 weeks to meet the kids and observe, the kids are a riot and i love them already-- but its def going to be a challenge.  Im just nervous because two weeks just sooo wasnt enough time to obtain all the info i need to run this class-- and its crazy cause well, I start monday june 18th and im nervous as fuck.  They offered me a summer job running the autistic preschool extended school year program. Soooo much to do/learn!!!!!!!!  Anywayz.  I probably wont be on this for a while so. I havnt had time or want to go on this or myspace much. But I will post here and there with updates or if I feel like i need to write."

I'm getting it on my back same place megan has hers... Im a lil scared cause well I suck when it comes to pain haha but oh well... At the same time I cant wait! I have been waiting for a tattoo since I was like 16 when hide and I thought of getting lil carebear stars... but its been a few years that I have been thinking of the right tattoo for me... I dont just want to get a tattoo like other girls get them... So this took alot of thought.  I cant wait!!!!!!"

My mom, being nice and not knowing what to say, was like um yeah sure...and his mom went on about jeff's life now or whatever--- oh and the crazy crack head and she friggin asks my mom about my ""pms-ing"" and if im still ""dramatic"" (although my mom said dramatic wasnt the word she used she just cant think of the actual word) WTF? haha oh and apparently he's dating some new chick, ""but he's being careful because he's had his heart broken.""  Was she trying to put a guilt trip on me through my mother? I'm not sure... whatever its in the past, its been two years...get over it.  The woman isnt wrapped too tight.   WTF am I going to do with pics of me and my ex from 2 years ago?  Normal people would throw these things out if they came accross them, they wouldnt call their son's ex-girlfriends mother and ask if she wants them.  My mom didnt even like him very much.

1.  Student teaching is going ok,  I love it, however my relationship with my teacher isnt quite how I thought it would be when I first started... I dont think she cares for me much.  I have a feeling that if she was asked about me, she would say I suck or something.  whatev... I need to work on my classroom management skills.. sometimes I have it, but latly I dont... But its all a learning experience.  I broke down a few times because I felt overwhelmed and thought that I sucked at teaching... but now Im looking at everything in a postive way... I'm taking note of things and reflecting on my days... thinking of how I can hangle things better the next time they happen.  

2. These past few monthes in the guy department have been eh.  A few guys have been interested,  its funny.... cause I think one of them felt I was too, ""girlie"" and was more on the rocker/grunge end, where as another guy felt I wasnt girlie enough where as he was more of the club going pretty boy.  Other than that I've had fiascos such as guys trying to hook up with me while their girlfriend or ""girl"" are in the same vacinity.  I decided to just say fuck 'em all and not give into temptation...thinking back most of my ""hook-ups"" were more out of lust than anything,  none of them were or are guys I would actually want to date.  

3.  There maybe sunshine through the clouds... I have a date tomorrow! Met him outside while waiting to get into a bar-- get this yeah I was sober as a doornail.  Turns out we were meeting up with the same people--- his sister!  To sum things up, we've talked the past two nights and he is comming here tomorrow to take me out.  I'm pretty phsyched although I don't want to get too phsyched just yet... But he seems really cool, 25 (just the right age, I'm finding that guys my age are still lost in the dark)we seem to like the same music, we've had similar experiences with moving from bergan country to somewhere as just as we were entering highschool,  he graduated from UCONN, has a real job, and has an apartment with friends.  I must say, this is most definitly  an upgrade from the guys i have talked to.  None the less, I want to see how this whole ""date"" goes before anything else.  


Ok well,  thats about it for now :)"

I was looking for something in my drawer today before work and I came across some pics I havnt seen in forever. A bunch of them were of Hide and me, which brought back lots of fun memories, along with some pics from project grad and some other random ones. Amongst some of the random ones was a picture of me and Ben... no not McDermit... but Beragona (not sure if I spelt that right but)... It was from the summer of 02 when we I guess you could say dated?  Anywayz,  it was a picture Hide took of us when her, me, Ben and Tim went on this corny but cute picnic that hide and I put together.  It just brought back alot of feelings and lost memories.. its weird.  It was 5 years ago... I have thought of him since then... quite a few times, but after seeing this pic again I just cant get any of it out of my mind. I cant help but wonder if I ever pop into his mind at all... probly not, but... I dunno.  I wish I had stayed in contact with him... I wish I hadnt ""ended"" it over the phone... I wish that I had lost it to him when I wanted to instead of the way I did.  I dont even know why Im letting this get to me... its rather silly..."

"event","So I have decided to forget about stupid things like guys, and concentrate on me.  I have alot on my plate this semester and I wanna do really good with student teaching.  Besides, it seems that all I can attract right now are guys who just want a good time or guys with girlfriends.  Im through with all that shit... Time to grow up.  Saturday night Nicole's brother told her he thought i was cute,  but she knows my new resolution and told him no!  I fell asleep on her couch....with my legs over him(cuz he was sitting on the couch watching TV still) but that was all... I had no interest for anything else--- although I know if i wanted more I so could have gotten it... he had told Nicole earlier that night that I was cute, but he has a girlfriend and Nicole knowing my resolution told him NO!  Cuz seriously the past 2 or 3 guys that hit on me or that I ""hooked up with"" turned out having girlfriends or ""a girl"".... yeah I dont wanna deal with that shit.  If anything... I would want to meet a guy who's mature and not all about ""partying"" and ""getting ass.""  But for now,  I think I will concentrate on me and keeping me stress-free. Like I said, its time to grow up, and part of growing up is leaving behing chilish things, and ""hookups"" and stupid boys are two of those things."

Sat night:  went over to Nicole and Daves... it was us three plus 3 of daves guy friends and some chick one of them came with.  we were all having fun and stuff drinking playin pong and cards... two of the guys came together, but the driver left early, so the chick agreed to give him a ride home... Dave and this boy Eric started gettin dumb... dave was loud and two of them went up on the roof of the aprt. ... Nicole got pissed... they got into this fight... Eric's girl i guess got annoyed with him and went inside and sat on the couch... him and I were outside smokin stoges.. I was consoling Nicole... and as i was doin so Eric (who was sitting near where i was standing) began to rub my leg... i yelled at him and told him to stop.. nicole went inside... him and I were talkin bout nicole and dave... he started to hit on me again I yelled at him... we started talkin bout cole and dave again.. he motioned me towards him as if he wanted to say sumthin but didnt want cole or dave to hear... but instead he went to kiss me... as he was doing so this chick walks out! they had words, i walked into the kitchen and bugged out... he came into the kitchen and I yelled/lectured him what he did was wrong, he kissed me.  She was going to have her mom pick her up, but stayed and slept on the sofa.. afraid of going back into the living room I hung out with nicole and him in the dining room where i proceeded to lecture him, he continued to kiss him and I wasnt very sucessful in stopping him.  everyone went to bed, we stayed up and drank/talked for another 2 hours or so... we wound up sleeping next to each other on the floor of the dining room... I woke up in the morning and she was gone, and left the 2 boys there... so I drove them to erics place... its funny cuz the one boy was at a party a friend of mine had back in July... and I hooked up with his friend Brian(whos also daves good friend) and he had to pick us up the next morning cuz someone took Brians car for sum reason... but this time it was he who was stranded, ha cuz drama happend with me and another one of his friends... it was crazy.  


Tonight:  was driving home from the diner, about to pass the dunkin donuts on 46... outta no where there was this huge mass in the rd infront of me... i go to stop but i hit it anyway.. i bugged and kept driving... we tried to call the cops to let them know but didnt get through... got to katies and my car was ok--we decided to go back to see wtf it was.. on the way we saw 2 amblunces... we got there and there was nothing... we werte like wtf--- we turned around and as we passed it again there were amblunces and police in the parking lotWe freaked, we werent sure what happend and/or if it had to do with what I had hit-- so we turned around again and drove into the parking lot to investigate...by this time there was only one cop car there... i got out and talked to them and told them what happend and I found out that it was a sofa bed that fell outta someones car and onto an off duty officers car (smashed his windshield and immploded the airbags but he was ok for the most part) I must have hit it right after it hit him.  It was just bizzare and I'm just glad that i didnt get into a serious accident!

I had everything ready the day the class ended, and somehow got distracted (which is pretty easy with me as we all know).   So yeah.. now i just have to hope that they take these credits and get through this semester successfully.  I know its going to be alot of work... student teaching + student teaching seminar + some sped class + working at chilis about 5 nights/days out of the week.  God help me!

Anyways,  I started student teaching, and so far i love it!  I have 3rd graders in a self-contained class, however they join with the class next door for social studies/science.  There's about 12 of them, 3 girls the rest boys.  They are awsome, and so is my teacher.  Monday I get to give the kids a small math assessment to see where they are with adding and subtracting.... cuz more or less they are at a 1st grade level or lower.  however,  with the exception of the one girl with down syndrome, you couldnt tell that they were sped students.  

Anywayz im super excited.  although i wish that all i had to do this semester was student teach, but with out the classes and seminars!"

On the bright side... I met a boy. I went to Murpheys thursday night with some friends and met this guy named Scott. It was kinda cute... its like we both spotted each other from accross the bar and then he came over and talked to me after playing the eye game for a bit.  We wound up talkin the rest of the evening until I had to go, inwhich we ended with a kiss.  Right away I thought that this was just some stupid night out because we kissed--- but he called me up the next day and texted me all throughout the day.. On saturday I met up with him and some of his friends and brought katie and Heather along with me... it went ok, crazy thing is, is that I didnt really care too much at first, thought that this would just be some thing esp since he's just turning 22 in Nov and is a year behind me in school--- but after hanging out with him I started to really gain interest... esp. once I got to hang out with just him later sat night and then he came over and watched a movie here on Sunday night.  I had a really great time with him... I'm gonna try and not get too whatever... and just take things one day at a time and see where things go."

I got 2 nice sweater shirts and two pairs of pants along with two shirts that i could go out in at night. Everything I got is a more grown up/mature look.  Even the shirts I got to wear out... they are fun though at the same time.  When I was trying on one of the outfits and went out to see what Hannah thought she laughed... i asked her what was so funny and she said it was because i looked so different.  I just dont want to dress like a teenager any more-- at the same time I dont want to dress like I'm some middle aged chick.   Another decision that I've decided on is that I'm going to dye my hair light brown.  Nothing too dark,  but somthing darker than what I am now, only because the ""dark blonde"" I used last time wasnt as dark as I would have liked it to be-- I'm trying to get closer to my natural color--which will never actually be achieved but oh well.  I dont know when I'm going to do this exactly but eventually.  Cory said that she might be able to do it for me, which would be awsome.

I was also thinkin of getting it on my lower back but I changed my mind... I would rather have it on my upper back in the center...   well... im gonna talk to some people and try and think of a sweet design... when I will get it i dont know... gotta price things out and such.  if amy had her business goin I know i could get it for free but that could be a year or more away... then again by then i might actually get the nerve and the money to get it... we shall see.  at least i have the idea now."

We were up in the air about what we were going to do, since it was our friends Juans b-day and there was talk about going into the village.  Well it wound up with the 3 of us girls just goin to Mo-town and meeting up with 3 of Hannah's guy friends from home... two of which we usually hang out with when we go out.. After a bit the three of us decided to just go into the city for the hell of it.  This was the 3rd time my car was in the city!  the first time Brian drove it in and I drove home... 2nd time i drove us girls in and out, and this time i drove there and back--- and I parralled parked successfully on McDoogle!!!!!!!! We went to Off the Wagon for a bit then like two other bars before we decided we were tired and way too sober for the crowd that was in the village.  It was still fun though... we got hit on by the oddest people and saw some interesting things.  Its always an adventure.  

Well last night girl talk ensued as usual...land after last night I've once again decided to change my ways.  Although at this point in time Im convinced I will be forever single,  I have decided its time to step it up a bit if I'm ever going to find the kind of guy I know I want.  This includes an end to wearing the same stuff I've had since I was 19, and i guess dressing more my age?  I mean I still wanna dress like me, but just a tad more mature.  Looking like im `16 would be great if I was 30 but not while Im 22.... I've also come to the reality  that attempting to date anyone that I had a drunken hookup with esp the first night meeting them, neverrrrrr works out.  And so the hookups will be put to an end... yeah i know this is like the 10th time I've declared this,  but...  whatev.  


Oh yeah quick update... hehe my brother is working with me at Chilis now.  Haha... he just started training the other day... I hope he does well... I'm gonna try and help him as much as I can... I'm also hoping this brings us closer together.  

I was supposed to work a double today, but when i got in at 11:15, Ang told me I could go home and just work my dinner shift..which is once again assistant closing..bah. Along with everything else, I also declared that I was going to just chill tonight since the past two nights have been rather late and exhausting.  However... I dont know how well I will keep to that declaration."

"event","ok so bonnaroo was absolutly AMAZING! it was so much fun. i cant even begin to explain it.   i wish it didnt have to end.   in the matter of the 4 days i was there i saw so many great bands.  

First day: thursday:  we finally arrived at bonnaroo after a 14 hour drive... after setting up our tents and getting settled we walked around... that night I saw sum band called the Cat Empire which was awsome,  they were like spanish/regae/rock but they were Australian.... That night i smoked with my cusin sean... haha it was funny as hell... 

2nd day: saw bens fold for a bit, a lil bit of oyster head, death cab for cutie, G. Love and Special Sauce--- AWSOME, then the big thing was seeing TOM PETTY!  friggin Stevie Nicks came out too! and he ended his set with American Girl! (my fav)

3rd day:  saw a lil bit of Elvis Costello, Damian Marly, Gomez, a lil bit of Blues Travelers, Beck, and then Radio head--- awsome awsome awsome

4th day:  saw Bela Fleck, Moe, a lil bit of Bonnie Raitt, and then PHil Lesh and Friends ( guy from the greatful dead)  and Joan Osborne was with them and fuckin ROCKED!  during the last one we all ate choc covered shrooms and it poured for the last hour or so--- it was amazing--- sam katie and I joined a bunch a people dancing and danced like hippies... it was sooooo much fun

The whole thing was amazing,  there were no fights, no moshes, everyone wass super friendly--- I walked around in shorts and my bathing suit top almost all the time if not a wife beater... i got mad burned but it turned into a tan--- i was so red that random people were offering me sunblock while we were in line for things,  some just put it on me.  People were walking around selling just about anything and everything-- although surprisingly enough pot wasnt really one of the things being sold... i mean everyone had it or hash, but for themselves although everyone shared with each other... like you could be watching a band or sitting at your tent and people would share their bowl with you or whatever....  then there was shakedown street where all the vendors were and you could get anything there--- it was funny cuz sum were selling t-shirts  and morpheme... same as at the campsites-- people were just walkin around sellin stuff. I met lots of interesting people... played in this giant water mushroom... it was great.  

The day we left we all stopped in VA and got hotel rooms at a microtel... there was a chilis in walking distance and since one of our freinds is a manager we ate there cuz we got a nice big discount...  didnt get home till late wensday night....  then on thursday Brian Sam and I went to pt pleasant and seaside.... thursday i helped out at camp and went over ash's cuz she had sum people over... John caulfield came over at like 2 in the morning haha... it was funny as hell... fri night a bunch of us went to a party at adams new house...he used to be the bartender at the brew... it was fun times... sat night us girls went out to morristown for drinks... sunday night katie and I took a random rd trip.. wound up in new hope pa then somerville NJ where we ate at a diner and had sum boy jump up to our window and expose himself to us....40 min later while we were in my car gettin ready to go he showed up again-- he covered his face with his shirt and walked quickly towards my car---- we bugged out and I took off, but when we drove past where he had ran too he was gone.... we called the diner to let them know... it was kind creepy-- cuz he wasnt sumone we saw in the diner... and the fact that he was there 40 min after we were at the diner and saw us at my car... eeeeehh.... 

tomorrow I'm goin to help out dan with camp, then got a dr's appointment, i think i might be gettin bronchotis or sumthin.... then i think im hanging out with hannah and meetin up with sam later on.... yay!  ok well thats all haha..."

Saturday I went to kt's new house for mary's b-day, it was fun, and i got to see everyone :)  

Wensday night I met up with Sam and Goo (who's real name is Brian)... at brews, we sat there for a lil bit then i got bored and stated we should go on a rd trip... brain said boston but I had school at 11 the next morning so we agreed on AC-- Ryan and Chris met up with us at brew as we were talking it over, but Chirs wasnt able to go with us.... as we were driving we decided to just go to the city cuz its closer and since I had class.... we drove into the village at like 2am, picked up katie then went to cheap shots... when the bar closed we went for pizza.. along the way sam jokinly around told me to take a piece of fruit that was outside of  sum lil deli-- so i grabbed an orange and we ran cuz we thought, well i thought that they were after us for the orange... and then we hid until brian came over looking for us.. it was crazy...then we got pizza and i got a free slice!  I fell asleep as soon as we started back...I woke up and Ryan was gone, it was just goo, sam and I in the car in the parkin lot of brews---we slept in the car for a lil then i drove home at like 7:30..woke up at 9:30 for class then decided i didnt wanna go...ha..   thursday i just chilled and hung out..took it easy..

Last night i dropped my car off at the dealership cuz it was recalled for the power steering or sumthin-- then this morning i woke up and my mom told me that apparently i need new tie-rods that would cost me almost 200 bucks and that i couldnt drive my car this weekend.  Yeah IM PISSED.  we are taking it to our place though to get a second opinion.... errr sooo frustrating.. i had stuff i wanted/needed to do and now i cant do it.

There was no hostility or anything like that. We all got along and stuff.... it was a lil strange cuz he was wearing these new glasses, was wearing these cargoish pants with this button down collored shirt and a blazor...he NEVER dressed like that when we were going out...I was like wtf?  it was quite interesting...  I was interested to see if any feelings would come back or sumthin,  but no instead I was reminded of sum lil reasons I broke up with him...

hahaha and it was quite funny because well Hannah, Dom and sum others met Katie & I there as well, they wound up gettin there before us.  Turns out that Jeff was good freinds with one of Hannahs friends that I know, Charles... here was the convo more or less---- I remind you that Hannah went to Murpheys to make me feel a lil more comfy knowing that Jeff would be there, however she had never met or seen him. 

(after being introduced by charles)
Jeff:  yeah so my ex-girlfriend is gonna be here
Hannah:  oh really?
Jeff:  yeah she broke up with me cuz she wanted to be single for the summer 
Hannah:  well fuck her you dont need her

I walk in say hi to Hannah and Jeff....  They then realize what was goin on...  haha Hannah pulled me aside laughing and tells me what just happend...she had no clue that Jeff was ""Jeff""...


It was pretty funny... the rest of the night went alright,  I had my fun. Sat I went to the St Patty's parade in Morristown with katie and her sister, and met up with their dad, it was eh, but it was nice weather to be out, plus i got a hat hehe that im gonna wear fri, and I got free breakfest and lunch thanks to Katie's dad.... ok well thats all for now folks...."

I cant wait for DC...I heard that the part we are staying in is kinda like the village.  Im kinda dissapointed though right now cuz it was sooo warm today almost 74!!!! and I went to the mall with sam,  bought a really cute skirt..its kinda  long and white kinda hippyish... and I got sum new shirts and stuff,  but I was checking the weather for when we will be down in DC and the temp is gonna drop...eeerrr,  the warmest they say it will be is like 55 or sumthin.  Maybe i'll wear the damn thing anyway.  Oh yeah I need a suggestion while im at it,  because the skirt is white, um its a lil seee-through....even with white undies...any suggestions?????

They are an interesting group...its like being at camp but in a classroom setting.  Its fun though, I like when i get the time to help them with their work and stuff... and the teacher even gives me lil responsibilities here and there, like today before the boys got ready for their last class (which they go to a reg ed classroom for) They had to have their assignemnt pads out to show they wrote their homework down, and she told the kids that they could have it checked by either herself or ""Miss Manno""  hehe... 

Lunch in the faculty room was the best today...there were the same 2 teachers there besides myself and my co-op plus another teacher.  They are all really nice... sumhow the topic of strippers came about and it was the funniest convo ever.  Then I went and did a clumsy thing... thinking the top to my snapple bottle was on I went to go grab and shake it..well top wasnt on and ice-T went all over my lap making it look as if I peed my pants... luckily it dryed by the time we went back to the room.  

Last night my last class of the day was canceld due to Valentines day.  I didnt plan on doing anything... it's funny to think that this was the first time is 3 years I didnt have sumone take me out that this was the first valentines where I wasnt dating or seeing anyone.  But I wound up going to dinner with Hannah and Sam at Chilis ha...  it was a good dinner though,  Brian was our server and what shoulda been a 40 dollar or so check only came to about 15 bucks.  After that I went over to katies and hung out for a bit.  

I dont know what I'm doing tonight, hopefully Katie will still be around and we can go get a drink or sumthin.  Tomorrow I'm meeting up with my aunt annie and attending my cousin Christina's IEP meeting.  My first IEP meeting everr!  I'm really excited,  i get to see how things work and all.  Apparently my Uncle, my aunts ex will also be there,  I havnt seen him for a long time so that will be nice... Ok well I have class in like 5 minutes....   peeeeace"

I fell asleep watching X-files last night. It was a good episode..it was a to be continued, but luckily they put the contiuned part on right after---but I fell asleep.  I think I had a bad dream cuz i remember my mom and brother talking about it---Like someone came into my room and for some reason I got totally scared and screemed and stuff...turned out to be my mother comming in to turn off my tv and put my glasses on my dresser. I dont know what i was dreaming about, only that I was terrified of somthing. It could have been caused by falling asleep to the X-files, but it wasnt a ""scary"" episode.  Who knows.

Anywayz... Thursday night a bunch of us from Chilis went out for Brian's Birthday...we wound up goin to the Colorado Cafe, inwhich I wound up having to turn around in Newark Airport on the way there thanks to Brian. It wound up being a cool place for a thursday night, its pretty big and so theres lots of diff sections to hang out in.  later on we hung out at Dave's friends house then Sam & I slept over Brians.  Fri night I hung out with Katie, Dom, Hannah and some of her friends down at Murpheys, jacked was playing which was pretty hot, I havnt seen them play for a while.  

Saturday I had to work a double for the first time at work.  My lunch shift went pretty good,  Brian and Erin (two of the managers) gave me a pat on the back and told me that I was really improving and doing a good job.  Then came the dinner shift...friggin Jenna the airhead of a hostess screwed me up with my seating and seated me tables that werent mine and so at one point I was dealing with 5 tables running around like a chicken without a head...needless to say I screwed up and got ""talked to"" by Chris who does nothing but tell me what Im doing wrong.  The only time he ever said sumthing positive was when I sold a chamborde 1800 at 11:30 in the morning.  I was about to just have my origional 3 tables but then chris decided that he would ""make my evening alot easier and smoother"" and take away one of my tables... I could have handled 3.. I wanted to say somthing but all I could do was smile and nod.  Whatever...later that night katie and I went up to Ramapo to hang out with kelly and others at Marco's party...Sunday at work was mighty boring..it was rather dead. Tha fam came in to eat, but dint ask to sit with me cuz mom didnt wanna embaress me or sumthin, later on I met up with Sam & Others at Brew, which was also pretty dead so Sam, Brian & I went over to his house and played scategories which was intensly amazing.

I got there at 11:30, for some reason they forgot that I have to leave by 3 to get to class and assigned me section I, which is the closing lunch team.  I didnt know this until it was too late.  I didnt say anything to them yet though,  I will tomorrow though. It doesnt matter too much since this was only day 2 of this particular class, and I could always use the money. Today was pretty fun, they gave me 4 tables, and I think I handled them all very well.

I was 17 he was about... 20 or so... I avoided eye contact and prayed he wouldnt come say hi, which thank god he didnt...  Sunday...today... I had my first official day as a waitress.... They gave me 2 tables since im new and have never waitressed before,  which im perfectly fine with...things seemed to be going smoothly, i screwed up a few times but then smoothed things out... I wound up pickin up a diner shift where I was again given 2 tables, and things went alot smoother.  I more or less made decent money considering... This week will be the first real week of school... eh I have to remember to call mount olive about my practicum.... I need to get back into school mode, although i dont think I was ever really in it.  Now with the new job and school I need to get grounded...  take a step back and settle into everything."

"event","Soooooooo i'm officially done with Justice and B&BW.  I started my Chilis training last week, and last night (sunday) was my fourth day.  Wensday is day 5, the last day...where I'm supposed to more or less be on my own with my trainer just following me.  last night this girl Jen who I've met before trained me, it was kinda crazy cuz it got really busy, she kept kinda disapearing and I was left by myself for somethings. it was a learning experience.   Im still kinda nervous about this whole waitressing thing.  I dont wanna screw it up.   I know its just a silly job,  but its all a challenge for me. Hopefully I will catch on more and have it all down pat.  

Anywayz,  today I went to visit my Nana & Pop-Pop for the day.  I always enjoy spending time with them.  My grandfather always cracks me up, and my Nana is always easy to talk to about everything.   I wish i could get up there to see them more often.  I wish i would think of it more often.  

School starts tomorrow... I'm totally not ready for it.  I still have some things to do, people to call and so forth.  I wish I had an extra week or two... Tuesdays are gonna SUCK cuz i have a big gap between classes... this is the first time i'm experiencing this as a commuter.  I've had gaps before when i lived on campus which was fine,  but as a commuter its gonna BLOW."

"event","Ok sooo i havnt written in this in forever.... I dont even know where to begin ha... well workwise, I've been workin at the new store Justice for a lil over a month now,  along with Bath & body works on sundays.  Things seemed to be going well, but recently Dayna (my boss at Justice) has been treating me and some others differntly.  I havnt been getting the hours she told me I would be getting, and then last week she told me that this week my hours were cut dramatically and that I should take it personally.  I called out sick once, granted I called half an hour after I was supposed to be there, but there was nothing i really could have done.  She made it seem like i havnt been showing up to work at all, and then told me that when i start ""being myself"" again then I would get my hours back.  I dont know what she was talking about cuz I can honestly say that I dont think i havnt been myself, I am one of the most energetic people working there.  I also found out that she was frowning down upon the fact that Christy and I hang out, and are freinds with karen which she already knew when she practically begged us to work at the new store. So I went and filled out an application at Chilis where Sam works.  I had my first interview a week and a half ago and then had my 2nd interview today....and got the job. Im going to be giving my 2 weeks notice to both jobs tomorrow, but its weird cuz I dont know what to say to Dayna.  She's been cool with me the past few days and I havnt given any indication that I'm not happy there.  Im not a very confrontational person....  I think all I can say is that money is really tight these days and that i can make more with waitressing.  In one night Sam made 150 bucks on a Fri.  It takes me 2 weeks just to make 180.   

Boywise,  guys suck.  Theres this boy Jessi that works with sam that I hooked up with like twice,  he's a nice guy and for a moment I thought I had some interest but Im realizing that I really dont, so friends we shall just be.  Sometimes I wonder if I will ever find the right guy.  I know im still young but it just pops in my head everynow and then... whatevers,  im not gonna find it if i keep thinking about it. 

I think thats all for now,  the whole job thing is the only big thing right now.  I got my grades back from school,  I made deans list with a 3.5 sumthin which im pretty happy about.  yeah,  thats about it."

"event","Being single has its ups and downs.  I like my independence, I like the excitment of meeting a new guy... I like flirting...  However,  I also like having someone there, someone to hold me, someone to brush the hair outta my face.  I know i am still young and I've got a lot to live and a lot to learn, but I cant help but wonder when will he come along?  The guy who will sweep me off my feet, the missing puzzle piece to my insane life, someone who I will never ever get bored of or fall out of love with...

 Sat. night I got a gigantic bruise behind my leg, its propbly the grossest bruise I've ever had.  Well thats what I get for attempting to cross an icy playground bridge where theres space between the planks of wood while slightly intoxicated.  It was all fun though, a bunch of us went over to the playground late at night and we even played a round of hide and seek!  Then we just hopped over to the ftball field and laid on the 50 yrd line and gazed at the stars.  It was sooooooooooo beautiful out! Kelly's friend Mike, who's friends with her ex-John was also up and I could tell right away he was interested,  but after talking  to him for a while he did not meet all the requirements on my mental check list.  He's 24,almost 25,  went to school and graduated and all, buttt no real job yet.  Um yeah no.  sorry.  he wasnt that cool anywayz.  

Anyhoooo Im excited for Thanksgiving! I like thanksgiving more than any holiday everrrr cuz theres all sorts of good food.  I CANT WAIT!!!  And tonight a bunch of us are goin to the Junction,  I hope it's as much fun as it was fri night!  Although fri  night will be hard to top! Ok thats all,  dont wanna bore you all if i havnt already."

He was supposed to call me this afternoon to make real plans, cuz he had said sumthin bout meetin up at 5---  5 came around and no call,  i was kinda disapointed.... but then he called like a lil bit after that... we wound up meeting at place he works at, and then we went over to the Hampton diner.. which is actually a nice diner.  He bought me dinner and all, and we just sat and talked for a while.. it was a nice evening :)  He says he wants to hang out again soon,  i dont know when that will be but i hope it happens.  he's got a cool personality and really nice eyes heh...  we shall seeee...."

"event","This week has been nothin but boring and stressful.  Sunday night I just stayed home, monday went to school then went out for a drink with sam when she got outta work, but we didnt even feel like drinking so we went to the diner and just chilled.  Tuesday I had to take of financial stuff cuz the school was sayin i still owed them money even though i thought i got that all taken care of...but then I was forceful and demanded that they fix it and they did! Oh ha and well because i was dropped from classes for like 2 days they lost my ran # which i need to register for classes... so i need to go get that tomorrow... 

I just feel like things are  blah right now. Yes, blah is the word im going to describe things.  At the beginning of the semester I was all psyched up and happy,  but now Im just, well,  blah. I have fun when i go up to hang out with everyone at ramapo and stuff, and have fun when i go out with friends, but i feel like theres somthing missing.  Like somesort of excitement that would keep me on my toes.  I know life cant always be exciting and fun heh, but right now i need it. 

Tomorrow night Im supposed to go to Brice's frat house for a black light party, hopefully that will be fun... then friday i might go out to the junction---so we shall see how that all goes,  im sure I will have fun,  but will it provide me with that adrenaline rush i am lokking for?"

Here's a joke.
There was a terrible accident in NY.  A bus carrying 34 passengers lost control and rolled down a hill turning over and over again.  All 34 passengers died.  When they all reached the pearly white gates.  St. Pete was there to greet them.  He asked them to wait, and went running to God saying ""God, God, we have 34 New Yorkers waiting to come in.  What do I do?"" God said, ""Let them in of course"".  So St. Peter ran back and a few seconds later was running back to God saying, ""There gone, there gone"", God said, ""Where do you think they went?"" St.Peter said, ""I don't know, but pearly white gates are gone"".LOL

Since I know my son would try to be superman, we couldn't go the bunk bed route, so we went for the trundle.  Well, that darned thing came up to my neck.  I am wondering how high the beds would be if we did put the bunk beds.  I told Kristina that we didn't have a guardrail for her so we needed to bring the bed down to a twin.  She wasn't really happy, but didn't complain either.WHEW  Even the twin was pretty high, but if she fell she wouldn't break anything-hopefully.  So I go in and check on her and half her body is off the bed just hanging there.LOL  So I scoot her back onto her bed.  I think we need a guardrail.
For tonight, I put her nightstand next to her bed.  Hopefully, she will be on her bed in the morning, and not on top of the nightstand.  If she is I will take a picture.LOL
Anyway, last night she had a nightmare about a big octopus chasing her, so putting her down tonight wasn't easy, especially being in a new bed.  I think she got up 100 times.
Oh well, she is asleep along with everyone else, and I am taking a much needed time out!

The coach has them jumping into hugh ball pits, climbing mountains by rope, swinging from rings and letting go into a ball pit, jumping on trampolines, catching balls while jumping on trampolines, etc...  The girls won't do half this stuff without crying.  My hubby wasn't so thrilled about him in gymnastics until he came to an evening class because we had a make up.  After the class he was amazed how boy oriented it was, and felt better about it.  My son loves this kind of rough and tumble play.  He is by all means 100% boy!  I just wish he would listen better.  I would love to try a class without me in it. I know that he would stay with the coach.  It's a game with me in there with him.

He is in the toddler group, which means mommy has to be in there with him.(sign)  He has come a long way, as far as, building his muscles and eye/hand coordination, but he doesn't listen or do anything the coach wants him to do unless it is something he wants to do.  I was so frustrated with chasing him around today, that I didn't sign him back up. The other parents love him because he is a ham, but I can't seem to find anything funny about his misbehavior.  He is the only boy in the class, and one of the oldest.  The others are around 15 to 20 months old.  They don't pay attention all that great either, but at least they, for the most part, stay with their mothers.  The gym is hugh and he takes off like lightening.  If I call for him to come back, he takes his sweet time, and by this time he has all the others following in his footsteps.  My blood pressure skyrockets whenever we go.  I know this can't be healthy for either of us.  He doesn't need his mother harping on him, and I don't need a heart-attack.  I think I will wait and see what he says next week when Kristina goes and he doesn't.
Is he too young for this kind of structure?  Should I wait until he is 3, and see what happens?
He loves going, but it is driving me crazy.  The three year old class is mommy free.  I know he will do better without me in there.  That's a fact!!LOL"

Thanks bunches!!!!"

"event","I took the kids for a train ride today.  These are the mini-trains, and what a blast they are.  The only downfall was that it started to rain, and we were drenched by the time we got back to the station.  So we walked in the rain to the car.:O)  We were soaked!!  It was fun though.:O)  We went home took a nice warm bath had lunch, and now they are both napping.YAY ME"

"event","It was a yucky day today.  No outside fun, and the kids drove me batty.  I do not have indoor toddlers.  They honestly have no clue what to do when stranded inside.  Since it hardly ever happens.  Anyway, if I play one more game of Candyland I will have to be put in the loony bin.
My son does pretty well on a small scale.  He will build with his blocks and play with his trains, but than the house looks like a hurricane came through it.(sign)  He is terrible with cleaning up.  It is blood, sweat, and tears to get him to HELP clean up.
We did have gymnastics this morning so that helped unload some energy, but for some ODD reason, my son did not nap today.  He was in his crib playing, and singing as loud as he could, which kept my daughter up, so needless to say it has been a very long day.
I got the kids down by 7:45.YAY ME"

"event","I am going to have to buck up, and go back to the SPCA to take a picture of that horse.(rolls eyes) Because if I keep hearing about it, I will truly go insane.(pulls hair)  I will have double prints made, and they can do whatever they want with that picture.  But that is it, the horse isn't getting any closer to this house.  I hope this works.(crossing fingers) My daughter said she would be happy with a picture.(yea right-LOL)  

On a lighter note, we saw the movie, ""My Big, Fat Greek Wedding"".  Some parts are really funny, others are pretty dry.  The movie, ""Chicago"", is way far better, in my opinion.  But the two movies are very different, so it's what you are into. I prefer woman killers over a wedding.LMAO j/k  Seriously, I love musicals over a regular movie any day!:O)"

"event","We went to my niece's 2nd birthday party today.  I am having a hard time with these outlandish birthday parties.  My niece's wasn't too bad, but the other parent's there were talking about their kid's birthday parties and what they were going to do.  I am having a hard time understanding why someone would want to spend close to $1000 on a birthday party.  Inviting 100 people to your baby's first birthday is insane to me.  Having $20  treat bags for the kids is ludicrous.  I don't care if you have the money or are multi-millionaires it's absurd.  I really think it sends a negative message to the kids.  It seems like people are trying to outdo everyone else.  Who can spend the most and have the best treat bags.  My two kid's birthday parties consist of family, cake, ice-cream, and a couple of balloons.  We make it special by what we say, not by what we buy!!
I don't know what I am going to do when my kid's start school, and are invited to these kind of parties.  I know that if I try to buy them a gift, nothing will be good enough unless I spend over $100 for it.(sign)
What ever happened to the good old days of pin the tail on the donkey, bobbing for apples, having sack races. making your own instruments and having a parade?  I am still going to do these fun things at my kids birthday parties. I refuse to do treat bags.  If I am going to supply the snacks, drinks, cake, ice cream and games, why would I give a treat bag?  I need a treat for surviving the occasion.LOL
Am I the only one who feels this way?  Tell me what you think and why?  I am really curious.:O)"

"event","I took the kids to SPCA, to look at some dogs and cats.  Do you think they had any interest?  Hell no!!  They could  of cared less.  Except for one animal.  They wanted the HORSE!!  I couldn't get them away from this poor, pathetic animal.  You could tell that he has been severely abused, so I am trying to tell my kids that you can't ride this horse, and NO HE IS NOT COMING HOME WITH US!!!  My daughter tried with all her heart to convince me that she is the only one on this planet who can take care of him.LOL  My son was crying his little heart out when we left without the horse!
My fault for not checking out this place first without kids.  I had no idea that they had a horse, cows, chickens, tons of rabbits.  They even had hamsters.  Now who in their right mind would take a hamster to the SPCA?  Take it to a school and let it be a classroom pet, along with all those bunnies. Hundreds of kids would be thrilled to take care of these little rodents at school.
Unbelievable!!!"

BTW, anyone with boys out there, how long before you got them potty trained?  Mine has ZERO interest.  He is 2.5 years old.
I was told that if you push little ones, they will regress and it will take even LONGER.(YIKES)"

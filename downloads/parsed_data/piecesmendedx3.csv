After that we went to Pizza Hut & had pizza & jus fooled around (haha...oh god) Finished up & then my mom dropped us off at WalMart so i could get my new cellyyyy & she went to skateland to get narinjan a ride home from a birthday party because the roads were getting really bad. Then she picked us up & we headed back to my house. Got there & my mom went to the store to get my cake & mike hooked up the piece my mom got so i can use my new playstation 2 on my tv. aww i love him!  =) a bunch of them played that while i set up my cell...than mike helped me wit some of it!

FrIdAy:
-Mike, Josh, Lauren, Tyrone, & Devon came over afterschool...

-Josh left

later...

-Josh came back to go to the dance
-Mike, Josh, Devon, & Tyrone went to the dance at like 7...
-Lauren & I got ready quick...then went at like 7:30

after the dance..

-Mike walked back with Josh, Lauren, & I to get his cell...then he left
-Lauren & I walked Josh to his dads...we walked him the back way from my house across the backside of the park following this weird guy & I was ""following footsteps"" so i didnt step in piles of snow & all the sudden they stopped by the tree...the guy had gone into the tree & i hadn't noticed, that was kinda creepy right lauren? haha
-finally went home after josh was finished tryin to scare lauren & i...
-got in our jammies, made mac & cheese...hotdogs, ice tea...then went upstairs & i talked to mike on the phone & lauren talked to people on the computer!

SaTuRdAy:
-went to the mall w/my mommmy & ning
-got my new digital since the other one died...oh well i got a more updated one for free since i had a warrenty :)
-went to eb games to get my ps2 & stuff for it...they didnt have any ps2's so i jus got the stuff to go w/it. memory card, controller, sims 2 bustin out, grand theft auto ""san andreas""
-tried to find a ps2 in other stores but i couldnt find one so i ordered one online when i came home!

SuNdAy:
-got ready
-went to mikes at like 1:30
-left at like 3 to go to the movies to watch ""white noise""...movie didnt start til like 4:50 so Mike, Tyrone, Kristin & I just walked around the mall for a bit then went to the movi

after the movie

-went to taco bell
-then went home

MoNdAy:

-schoooll...sucked, people talking about shit thats none of their business & felt like shit

TuEsDaY:
-felt like shitt...so i stayed home. slept all day & played ps2

WeDnEsDaY:

Today: unsure of what my plans are!

Lately: ive been reading through some quotes lauren sent me...

The hardest part
Isnt finding out who
yOu Need to be..
Its being content with who 
yOu are <--

(trying...) 

It's the things you hate about yourself that someday someone will love about you.


Things change, people change, but that doesn't mean to forget the past or try and cover it up. It simply means move on and treasure all the memories.

^ um yea...sad but true :/

Do i tell you how i feel and risk ruining everything, or do i keep my feelings bottled inside and keep things the way they are now?

*this applies to many events lately*

It's amazing, after all that we've been through, the good times and the bad, how we can walk by each other and pretend it never happened, give each other a polite awkward smile and move on...

^this reminds me of one certain *person*... (not that i havent tried to talk to her, but idk maybe ive made ""bad choices"" & awhile ago she told me i was ""lost""... i guess she wouldnt understand, as if shes made an attempt?) oh well...only time can tell?"

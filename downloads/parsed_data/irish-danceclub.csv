"event","Hello everyone. Wow I just found out that Paul Rodriguez ( the greatest skate ever alive ) is sponsered by Nike! But oh well this is Paul Rodriguez we are talking about. I am getting his shoes once they come out. Even if they are Nike. Well....I had KFC for dinner. I got popcorn chicken. Yummy. Haha. I called my love Megan today. For some reason I feel she is angry or upset with me. I hope not. Well I am buying Royal trucks. The reason is P - Rod rides for them! I wish to meet him someday. Skate with him and shit. That would be great. I wish it would never snow again. I hate it. Cant skate or anything. Curse the fucking snow! I Wanna live in Cali. or Florida. Thats my goal before I turn 20. I am gonna take a road trip to Cali and on the way tried to get sponsered. Everyone think I am not gonna be skateing anymore by 18 but I will not matter what. I will skate until I cant walk. Haha.... Anyone wanna email me can at mattdeckelman@hotmail.com if you want. Well I am gonna get going. Later everyone. Skate forever."

Hell yeah no school....just a good thing to start off the day.I will probably go down Cody's later. Skate the day away. I talked to the girl I admire this morning. But I had to get off the phone. The girl I admire is Megan Smith. I love her. We started going out 1 - 13 - 04. I have never been happier ever since. I hope we last. I have nothing else really to say about this morning. Later."

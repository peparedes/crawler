Decisions has been made already on his part. His choice was definitely not me, i understand it without bitterness, eversince we've been together i know that i'm only 2nd or 3rd on his list . 

The sad thing about our relationship is that somehow we outgrown each other...distance really took its toll on us...i got used to, him not being around. We've gone through so much, i've endured so much pain, up to the point when he lured me to what we are now. I've made a lot of wrong turns too, i'm even guilty of emotional infidelity, i don't even think i can look him in the eye...i think now is the time to be back on track again... to be in control! this time i will do what i should have done last april...i hope the good Lord will give me the strength to accomplish it this time around. 

Cliche as it may seem but it's for our own good. 

we've tried to work things out but it can't go on like that forever...its not just a simple issue of &quot;you and me&quot; or &quot;you and i&quot; ... a lot of people are involved already...people he cares about. time and fate is not even on our side. He still have plans...but i need execution! i guess we're not really meant to be!"

How have you've been? I'm so preoccupied with a lot of things that i somehow forgot you. If you're wondrin' what happened to me and that ""special someone"" that i always wrote about here...well we're doing good. No we're not a couple as we used to before, but we're friends...in fact i'm loving the set up hehe. Eventually i know we really have to let go, but at the moment we're enjoying whatever it is that we have...

As for me, i'm enjoying things...family, work, friends and hmmm..some ""sweet moments"" with someone...although i know that the ""no-strings attached"" thingy that i'm imposing on myself and this friend, will somehow backfire in the end..i'll just let it be. 

So there it is, i'll try to update you whenever i have the time and the energy.

Thanks for always listening.

Love,

Me"

"event","So he's here, he arrived friday night (082407). I was surprised last monday when i dropped the book his kid sister is borrowing from me. i thought he'd be here first week of september but for some reasons it was moved a little early, but he's just staying for a week.<br /><br />i know that for the past 12 months or so, i've been trying to move on and have a life of my own, away from his memories, but unfortunately i'm still struggling! Over the past few months we've been handling our ""relationship"" maturely, far from the ""immature couple"" that we were then. <br /><br />Seeing him last monday somehow brought me back to the fantasy world, its quite an experience feeling those different kind of emotions again. when i stood in their driveway and heard him calling her sister and telling her<i> ""dumating na ata yung bisita mo"",&nbsp; i really thought i was just hearing voices. </i>and then he opened the gate, and we both stared in awe, i just couldn't believe he's there.&nbsp; Automatically we gave each other a hug. Normally i would always tease him when i see him in his apron and wipe the sweat forming on his forehead but at that moment i was really absorbed by my emotions. Yaayy... a year ago, i was at that same house, fighting back my tears from blocking my sight as i hurriedly walked out of the door... and now, there i was infront of the man who put me in that predicament, without any feeling of bitterness for him. i guess the love we feel for each other and our constant communication somehow took away that ill-feeling. <br /><br />i spent the whole afternoon with them, and there was no single sign of awkwardness between us. and that's one thing that's disturbing me. being too comfortable with someone... specifically someone from the past would only lead into a seemingly platonic relationship. and that is some sort of validation of those battles in my head...the thing is, ideally its still&nbsp; him whom i want to spent my whole life with. i mean factor out the distance and whatever it is that happened in the past, it's still him i want to be with... but realistically speaking, set-up like these, and with the person that i am, i'm sure that it would just lead to a lifelong friendship (ang gulo ko, basta yun na yun hehe)...not that i don't want it but i just somehow feel it ( ok maybe i'm just too afraid to risk again or im just too afraid to commit again!). but as it is, i think i'm gonna live it this way, whether he's a friend or a lover, the important thing is that he's there for me. <br /><br />if you're gonna ask me if i'm still in love with him? i would say, yeah i do... but...<br /><br />darn pity me!"

I left my other phone at the office yesterday, i was too disoriented yesterday because of too many work load plus i'm so pissed off with one of my team mates. I reached home past 10 in the evening, took a 5 minute rest, took a shower, set the alarm of my other phone and then doze off, didn't even bother to eat dinner beacuse im dead tired. When the phone's clock finally hit 5:30am (today), there it was his voice recording...it was my alarm tone way back then. Just when i thought i've erased every memory of him on my phone, pictures, message and all...i missed out on that one. That voice recording of him who would always put a smile on my face each morning, ushering me to wake up and prepare myself&nbsp;to work...telling me how much he loves me. &nbsp;It just hit me so hard, didn't even had the strength to went to the office to render over time work. I could feel the nearly healed wound starts to open again, it felt so raw...so fresh and it hurts more than ever.&nbsp;

Oh God help me..."

Almost 10 hours of non-stop talking, goofing around, food tripping and reminiscing hehehe. After 2 long years, we were able to see each other, i mean the 6 of us. Usually i only got to see some of them, especially during the times when i was too busy with you know who/what. I hope i could post the pix, but unfortunately the downloading cable of my phone is somewhere else, and i don't want to go back to that place anymore<em>(baka kung ano pang makita ko, atakihin lang ako sa puso).<br /><br /></em>I'd like to think i'm ok, but i'm really not, i'm having those episodes again. I don't know when will it stop. After the goodbyes, i should be okay right? But its not like that, seems like the whole world is conspiring against me, those unwanted circumstances, darn i couldn't handle it anymore. When will&nbsp;this be really over? I hope i know the answer. I hope it's just as easy as making a time line and making it happen, but its not like that. The only good thing about this whole situation is that i appreciate my family and friends more than ever.

Don't know what else to feel, coz i have anticipated this. Though his words still pierce my every being, guess thats the way it should be. There's no use of ""staying together""&nbsp; in this so-called ""undefine"" relationship that we had.

The problem is i haven't forgiven myself yet, for things that i have done...not done... or could have done. Maybe we're not really meant for each other. <br /><br />Of course i'm still hurting, who wouldn't? But i think i'm slowly getting there, less crying moments during the night, i think the almost ""breakdown"" that i had last week change everything, i'm just so lucky my father was around, otherwise don't know what else could have happened.<br /><br />This time around, when i make a&nbsp;step forward there would no more blaming, no more enmity and as mush as possible no more looking back.

I'm no risk&nbsp;taker, i don't even believe in LDR but with you and for you i have taken all the risk, and yes it was worth it. I have even pictured in mind that as a man(with such set up like ours), u are more prone to find comfort, care and love&nbsp;from another person and i was cool about that and i remember telling that to you half-heartedly. But you were so firm in telling me that it won't happened and i believe you. And thats what makes it more painful...you...lying and hiding things from me. I wanted to trust you again, but i find it hard to do so. Iam no longer capable of distinguishing the truth from the lies and as much as i try to understand you i can't figure out why you have opted to conceal everything that&nbsp;was related to her and your so-called one week fling. I will no longer go further about it. All i wanted from you is your honesty...thats all i have asked from you, and unfortunately you have failed me. Thank you for everything. Hope things would be a lot better now that we have decided to go on separate ways.Don't worry about me, i'll be okay, i will try to.""</em></p>"

Evan and Jaron

The sky has lost it's color
The sun has turned to grey
At least that's how it feels to me
Whenever you're away

I crawl up in the corner
As I watch the minutes pass
Each one brings me closer to
The time when you'll be back
You're coming back

I can't take the distance
I can't take the miles
I can't take the time
Until the next time I see you smile
I can't take the distance
And I'm not ashamed
That I can't take a breath without saying your name
I can brave a hurricane
And still be standing tall when all the dust has settled down
But I can't take the distance

I still believe in feelings
But sometimes I feel too much
I make believe you're close to me
But it ain't close enough
Not nearly close enough"

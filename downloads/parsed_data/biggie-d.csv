"event","*YAWN* theres always something to write but im a lazy person to actually put my words into action. well, now that im home from my 10 day vacation from florida, 10:50 at night, no one on aol, and watching ""penn & teller's Bull shit"" on t.v. i figured i could do a little typing in thy journal. (why not, add a little bit to my multitasked life)

ok, well since i havent updated since the end of june. im going to bref this month up til now.

*************************************************************

uh...theres colorguard, work, doc's appontments, and overall lazy work. ooo...4TH OF JULY WEEKEND, i havent told you about that!     ok, well friday was good, went to work, came home. then saturday, went to work til 9:30 then off to the fireworks with my family, Maria, and Kathleens family. Fortunatly me and maria made it just in time for the 10:00 fireworks (b/c of work). it was nice.  then on Sunday...my family, me, Laurel, and Kathleen went to Greenfield village for the day to celebrate the holiday weekend. it was good, saw the weinermobile, I FOUND $100 ON THE GROUND!!!!!!! yep all mine bitch!   then saw the Detroit Symphany Orchastra while enjoying a relaxing night and more fireworks.  then on monday the 4th, Maria invited me to go to her dads house for the night. me and her went out on her pontune boat and went around the lake enjoying all the firework displays coming from all the different residences, then the meijers flowerland firework ceremony was awesome. plus you can say their were alot of ""happy"" people out that night lol, good time i really enjoyed myself.

*************************************************************

ok, now. the next thing that comes to mind is the weekend of the 7th, went to laurels grad party. that was nice, then off to work. cuz thats what i do :).. other than that i really cant recall that weekend *if i do i'll add it later*

*************************************************************

up next. my birthday!! on july 13th i had a small get together with family and a few friends *mom made a limit :( * i enjoyed myself. got really neat gifts and free sample wednesday at costco earlier in the day( good if your low on cash and need a lunch, lol) we watched anchor man, set off sparklers, and all round i believe that everyone had a good time. im glad that kt and nick got luke to come. im glad he's feelin better. Devon got me this really cool blow up palmtree with coconuts and monkey. the cake was cool too...it had a rainbow with clouds and lots of colors and a smiling sun! ooo, exciting. 
    then on my real b-day, i recieved calls from ppl *which i really appreciate!* and the power went out since 2 am that morning. all the straglers that slept over (maria, lauren, kathleen) my boss helen earlier in the week invited me to go to work so she can make me a b-day meal. so we all went to my work and had lunch there. it was good. then we just basicly crashed at my house for the day watching movies until everyone went home. it was a good way to spend my 17th b-day. 

*************************************************************

because of the weather we were debating wether to leave on friday or saturday for florida. psstt, yea the weather channel said it was supposed to storm all week. i got pictures and storm my ass, it was beautiful. anywho, i felt really bad that i missed Kevins grad party, but our trip was up in the air b/c of the hurricane, and that was the only time we could go *band camp, grr* i hope he had a good time still.  and that leads me to my Florida trip. unfortunatly, this entry is pretty long so with that im going to have to start a new one.......

ciao

"event","i remember sitting down with my nephew last christmas, telling him all about how i was going to be an animator for pixar when i grow up. i said that i would love to make the next Finding Nemo movie (it was such a good movie and i would love to be part of the next one) 
 (my nephew Ryan, has Fredricks disease. its along the same thing as muscular dystrophy only causes death in most cases.) i sat there telling him that if they do create a Finding Nemo 2, that i was going to name a fish character after him. he told me that if he could he would want to be a fish like Nemo, cuz even with a bad fin, he still very happy with his life.
  i didnt think anything of it back around christmas. but now that i see my little 9 yr old nephew walking in leg braces, and sometimes either a wheelchair or walker it just makes think how precious life is.  ""make a wish"" just sent my older sister, my brother in law, my nephew and neice a trip to Hawaii back on the 5 of may. they returned on the 13th and just this weekend had a ""welcome home"" party for him. it was really nice. he had a moon bounce, a clown, and his friends and family were there. except for my younger sister and i. unfortunatly i had to work and was unable to attend his party.
  my dad later at a track meet told me about his party and when he took off his leg braces, his ankles were like the size of a golfball (almost) and were tilting inwards, he only weighs 50 lbs, while the other boys in his class weigh more and look healther. its makes me tear not seeing my nephew as much, but when i do hes pale, he stumbles, cant keep his balance. yet at the same time he is the happiest little 9 yr old boy you would ever see.

*it just makes me sob hearing about him time to time from my dad. Ryan is getting worse and can hardly write. my dad told me that my older sister, Amy called him the other day in tears cuz she told him, ""she didnt want to bury a son""  she still strong with this situation, and im happy that ryans stepdad, my brother-in-law Dom is a wonderful parent and helps out alot.  and even thou i dont get along with my fathers side of the family, hearing all that makes my heart drop.  it worries me sick that some time he has to be in the hospitals for a week or two at a time. i dont know what else to do, im scared for him.  he's too young to have this happen to him. its not fair. *sobs*


my sister is selling FA braclets to help find a cure for his disease, i already bought 3, but if you want one just let me know and i'll make sure to get you one. GOD BLESS HIM.

ok so, today.  watched movies in parent child development, little party in world lit, getting yelled at in Richards class *screw her, Amy, your no dummy* , and playin scales in band.

yep, typical day in the life of me.

so then went to track, threw out my hip again * i think, or so this pain tells me*  practice goin good SHOT- eh, 24- 28.5 ft. DISC- 65- 69 ft. still need to improve but i was sore and coach was actin all girly, lol

came home, got ready in my black w/ neon green security shirt *awesome!* and off to a concert at the high school where i was on security agianst these little girl scouts.  CANDY BAND played there (moms who do concerts) and oh boy was it made for little girls.  they played songs such as sponge bob to wheels on the bus, but only rock style. i guess it was good for the little ones but not my cup of tea.  it was great thou me, casey, kathleen, amy, lydia, megan, and a whole bunch others were going to mosh pit for the hell of it but figured we'd crush some little folk.  so instead i got my t-shirt with the bands name and won a crunch bar pillow out of a raffle (traded it for a rasinette, much softer) other than that i had fun.  little girls runnin every where, me and amy made friends with one of the kids from the band (freshman from Royal Oak) 

fun, fun

off to bed, tired

Bowling went ok, 168 and 189, lost agianst south lyon. *cant wait til Friday, Regionals! Goin to kick butt!* so i stayed to watch JV til it was time for me to leave for work. around 2:30 mom gave me the keys for martins truck to head home to get ready. she said it was snowy, but by the time i got roads, it was slick! 

so trying to take caution i was probably goin, eh, roughly 20 mph. then this ass swirved his car and almost hit me. so, in reaction i tried moving out of the way. i hit ice, hit the break, couldnt stop and ended up in a 12 ft deep ditch with a creek runnin through it. the truck was on a 45 degree angle and water was leaking in. I wasnt hurt, so i grabbed my phone called mom (who was still at the bowling alley) and asked for her to come get me. it wasnt that far from the bowling alley. it was embarrassing, ppl stopping and asking me if i was alright, if i was sinking, yadda, yadda. cops came, mom came, everyone was stopped. traffic was backed up b/c of it. they finally got the truck out, no damage (besides a flooded passenger side, and the truck lookin like the swamp monster) my mom just had to sit there and laugh, telling me that she wishes she had a camera, and that i was lucky the car didnt roll over, or i got hurt. 

went to grandmas, martins got the truck, and for today...nope, no driven for me *at least until this weather dies down* so, yea now im watchen dodgeball.

"event","wow, what a day...*mom's bitchy, but hey*

lets see...my first wake up call was at 6:38 this morning panicing that dayna and i were going to be late for school, lol little did i know that ""hey!"" it was saturday! (wow that rhymed) second wake up was around 10 am where i faced my mother ignoring me (she wasnt happy with me) yadda, yadda. later giving me a speech about my attitude and such.

the day progressed, my mom talking to me little by little, and by recieving LOTS of phone calls *im soo loved :) * i continued taking my time getting ready for the big night. this took up about 3 hours, watching random movies painting nails and so forth.  then this particular phone call came telling me to be at a place at a time that was an hour away (did you get that?) *cough, cough* 

so yes, that was the part where i rushed, taking my shower, shaving, brushing teeth, getting dressed, make up, and my favorite ""the HAIR"" that took flippen forever! i was late and ashamed, i really wanted to be on time but my mom insited on putting more feathers in.  i mean this is the year for feathers! but why am i always late to things. oh and my mom being an overprotective mom authority was asking me those dreaded questions-who, where, what time, stuff.  

i made it to bens house, (with KT, Kevin, Casey, Kristin, Sasha, Ben, Luke, and Nick there) getting ready to take pictures finally!  oh and get this...my mom calls!!!!!!!!  WTF? so yea, that was fun. my mom lectureing me some more, about time and rides and crap. i understand that she wants me to be safe yet have fun, but what about freedom? can i go anywhere where i have to be inturupted b/c she calls just to check on me. geez, and she wants me to grow up. ok enough bitching.

took pictures, had fun, left for dance. arrived at dance, went inside, and the party started!!!  we all danced like albino white ppl, god was it fun! i mossied around to all my lil clicks and snapped photos of everyone (my cameras almost out). i had great fun. danced for 3 hours straight!!! with guys with the gals, with everyone.  wow that was fun.

then the dance was over, went to McDonalds, almost got hit, had a nice LARGE drink then came home (mom wanted me home by 11, poo) so now im typing this sorta 3 page long journal that your reading right now. its about 11:36 right now and i have a headache like a friggen hang over, my tummy hurts-havent eaten all day *seriously* and im tired

ONE HELL OF A FUN NIGHT!

"event","*yawn* good evening ya'll (i dont know...thats been my saying lately)

so anywho... Today was our science olympiad Clio meet!  sadly only 2 events placed but its ok, good job guys!

basicly today was followed by last night.  FRIDAY: after school, went to work around 4 til 7:30.  met my mom and martin over at that petsmart place near bestbuy to buy new fish (gave the two ""paranhas"" to MR. pumford, they ate all of our other fish) we got about 16 new fish for our tank, to start off. picked up KT for our lil' 'sleep over', came back and started to finish up on last things before the Clio meet (finishing up tower, dynamic planet, etc.)  this took us till at least midnight. KT turned on Chris Rock so i stayed up til 1 in the mornin' laughing my ass off to him. KT fell asleep, really quick! gah.. then we had to wake up around 6 am to get ready for clio.

the car ride up was interesting.  it was my mom, me, KT, and Maria in my moms car.  i was soo over tired that i was cracking my self up, for no reason! lol, i still do! 

to cut it short.  we arrived at Clio, set up our Hartland section then did our events. OMG!! Hartland had like, the most food for 7 teams.  every other team had their event materials scattered across tables...nope, not hartland we had enough food to choke a horse! for only 18 ppl we had more food to feed 40~ it was great, lol!

Tower went well, our 16.2g paper wieght tower held all 33kg but not enough to place, grr. but the day did go on! we had some good times at the table, like me and maria playing dumbass war; me, KT, and duffie (D-Diddy) getting all loopy on gummy bears! GET R' DONE!

Finally the award ceromony. only 2 events placed (good job), oh well we never do good at clio, but wait til regionals we'll rule! We convinced KT to tag along her little bag of goodies-gummybears.  OMG! did we have fun with those! doing little skits with them, throwing them, eating them, boy were we loopy! it was great! it was so much fun i cant think clearly!


lol, what a fun yet tiring day. im only runnin on about 5-6 hours of sleep!
and tommorrow will be yet another eventful day, bowling at 9 in the morning then work at night...yay can wait *i need Sleep*

IM outie like a belly button (im really an innie)

<P>I played Soccer with my brothers. Again. </P>
<P>Met up with Katrina after and i like her.. hehehe. ;) She's really nice. <BR>I picked her up in her house and went to the mall. I treated her to some ice cream and we walked around. It sounds simple but i surely enjoyed her company. :) She stepped out of the door and she looked so pretty. (hehehe) </P>
<P>I promised my younger brothers i would take them out this friday. They want to watch Robots but mom said not on a school night. I hated being a kid. There were so many rules. </P>

"event","<P>I haven't updated in a long time. That's okay! That's why im updating now! (smiles) <BR>Today was ... let's just say, it was a ""mixed emotion"" day. School ended today so that was good but then my friend arrived from Canada and he's in a terrible condition (emotional side). That's not good/sad. </P>
<P>I'm spending xmas in France. Leaving this Friday, just in time for xmas. My dad doesnt like leaving around this time because he says, ""It's HARD to book flights&nbsp;during Christmas Season!&nbsp;Especially,&nbsp;the day&nbsp;before&nbsp;Christmas!"" Like i really care right... hahaha! He does all that shit. I just sit down and wait for the ticket to be given to me. &nbsp;</P>"

<P>I think i'm sleeping over John's house this Friday and Saturday. Cos we got this gig on the 20th... and i don't want to go home after the gig cos... i might be drunk. Dad's gonna kill me again and my little brother will tell me that i'm a bad example. fuckin ass is such a dork! I'm going to Rockwell this Friday to watch a movie. ANYONE WANNA COME?! I think it's gonna be John, Bryan and I only. I think Syche's coming. I dunno.... that guy is busy with something. I think he's plotting something. I think he's planning on ruling the world! NO! I'm already doing that. whatever. </P>"

<P>School is just one big shit hole. Mother fuckin teachers treat you like you're one fucking-ass stupid kid who's got no fucking life. </P>
<P>hey, we're moving... Dad wants to live around makati. I don't know why though. Is makati a city? I'm going to Rockwell later to check out the shirts there. I need a new polo. I lack clothes. I'm not a clothes guy.. i have 5 favorite shirts and that's what i wear all the time. You could call me pathetic. I think Dad and Mom are looking for a house in Bel-air, Rockwell condos or Greenmeadows. I think I'm going with him this weekend. I'm leaving for France next Tuesday (October 26). I'm meeting up with the Musseaux's and my parents are going to leave my brother and I with them. Cool! Back to the boards and bikes! Spending Halloween with them too. </P>

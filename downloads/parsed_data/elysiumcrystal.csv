"event","Well, I broke up with Shawn... I used to think There was nothing in the World I wanted more than him. ...In some ways, I still feel that way. 

I found out the other day... he kinda already has another girlfriend.... That hurt me alot. I'm happy for him.... Don't get me wrong. I wanted to break up with him... But, I guess I just didn't expect him to start dating again so quickly... I didn't relieze I could be replaced so easily, without a second thought. I didn't relieze how much it hurt to be replaced before I was replaced myself.

It makes me think that all the things he said to me... Asking me to marry him, that he still cares, is just fake... Maybe it was. Maybe he could give a rats ass about me now. But in the long ran, I don't think he loves me anymore... Maybe he never did. Which in turn is a good thing. But... I guess I still love him... 

I kinda thought it would be better for him - for me to leave him... But in a way... I don't want him to... I didn't want to break up with him... But I had to. I cheated on him with one of my childhood friends, Jason... And I really care about Jason too... And I know I can't have both of them... I just don't want to be in a long distance relationship anymore. 

I remember Shawn said that in two years, he'll come back for me... But with ""Jessica"" now... I don't think that will happen... I'm just really confused right now... I want him to be happy... But I want him to still love me - and only me... Its so wrong of me to feel this way... I feel like I'm treating him like a dog. I just don't want to loose him... 

And on the other hand, I don't want to be with him... Why must things be so confusing? I wish I could talk to someone about this, but I can't talk to Jason about it - It would hurt him. He already gets depressed when I tell him straight up ""Jason, you must understand. I love you, but I gave myself to Shawn. I will always love him. He was my true love."" And he should be. Its so cruel of me to say something like that, but I can't deny my feelings. 

And I can't talk to shawn... I've never been able to. Each time I try, I end up fouling it up and messing up what I tried to say, sounding like an idiot. And hes so stern and proper so, I kinda don't want to sound like I'm unintelligent so, I kinda try to show off while talking to him.... 

I think He was a bit surprised while I was talking to my other friends the other day while we were on the phone. Hes used to be saying certain things but the real me is a swearing bitch. he only saw the ""intelligent, shy"" type. I was acting like the ""wild and spicy"" type. Anyways... I'm just so upset and I don't know what to do..."

"event","Why does shawn think I am trying to break up with him? OMG it makes me so angry!!! I try to be the best girlfriend i can be, especially since we live so far away... I know there are a couple of guys who want to go out with me, but you'd think he would trust me enough. Sometimes i swear... maybe we shouldn't be together... Glen thinks i'll find someone new ... Same with Andrew... and I'm starting to believe them... I don't want a relationship this far away amore... I don't want to be accused of cheating and having my friends being stalked by him...if this keeps up.. i know what i will have to do... ... i feel so depressed.. and i don't want this to happen at this time.. with shawn getting his new job and all......I feel like crying... I'm just gonna go home and cut myself again."

"event","Well nothing much today... I met a new guy at www.findafreek.com. His name is Matt. He is okay. I don't really know him well. We talked for a few then he had to go to sleep. He lives in Toronto, Canada and he is 20. not bad lookin either. his screen name is X DEAD PERV X that was reassuring. I was like, great. a online pervert trying to rape me again. wonderful. But, like i said. hes cool. We like the same thigns and stuff too. Here, if anyone wants to see his profile (I'm sure Shawn will be all over it):

"event","Well nothing much today.. just cybering with 3 different guys at once. It always makes me wonder if they are masterbating when the do it. I know thats what you are supposted to, but when at school i doubt that is possible for me.
Well, shawn tried to find a new job yesterday. His parents will make him no matter what but I know he must be trying hard. I hope hes gets something good. I've been trying to get him to work at the mall but, he doesn't seem like he's too willing. He says the workforce up there is female dominated. Its so funny how countries are different, eh? Here, its so hard to find a job being a women here unless you are a cashier, a waitress, or something else female orintated. I need to find a job myself. They are hiring down at the Country Market, well mostly Dunkin Doughnuts but i'm not too willing to work in food services anymore. Next year or so, a mall will be opening here... and that means a whole bunch of jobs... but that isn't til a year or two away. Meh...

Oh well. byes."

"event","morning!
Well, nothing really new. Yesterday, it really sucked. My mother started to yell at me for no apparent reason. You see, she's been trying to join this stupid school craft fair, and I've been trying to help her out. Well, I talked to one of the stupid teachers and found out i had to pull some strings to get her in. I told her about it and i told her, there is a chance she still couldn't join since she never sent in the application. I told her she NEEDS to talk to the head person thing of the craftfair. Then she started yelling about how she would have done it if it wasn't for not having the money to join until the day before the fair and how the craftfair website said that you could wait for the last minute. And all that boring stuff. She started yelling at me and blah blah blah. I calmly told her, please, you don't have to yell. ""I'm not yelling! Your the one whos yelling!!"" I started to go down stairs saying i was fed up with her screaming at me, and all she was saying was ""F*ck the craft fair, F*ck the school! I didn't even want to go to the f*cking craft fair anyways!"" Gahhh... Those were her exact words too... I would swear but i am at school and a teacher is hovering over me.
Well, on a lighter mood, I was talking to my friend Justin, who lives in Wisconsin, and we were playing a very dirty version of madlibs. It's so much fun. ""How to go to sleep: Think of penises jumping over a cone and whisper naughty nothings in my naughty place"" It's just so wrong, yet so hilarious! But, I get along with justin alot. He wants to go out with me, but first, he lives in the middle of the USA, (i live in MA) and, hes... hes alittle wierd. Not in a bad way. I mean, I really love him alot. But.. Hes so obseesive. He has to call me every night, or he is not happy. He thinks about me constantly.. in otherwords, he's a stalker. But then there is shawn. I love him to death too. He is such a kind and gentle person. He is my boyfriend. We met over the internet about a year ago, and we just meet this october 15, our anniversary. And of course, after a few days.. you know.. we had sex and such. Which was both of our first times. ^_^ *blush* I love him so much... And i think I want to be with ihm, no i know i do.. I'm just so horney"

I had to work with bio diesel and the zebra fish. That was really boring. I am trying to work on a school project right now, it is on Methanol, but the teacher is kicking me off to let stupid freshmen on. Man do i hate freshmen. They are soo ignorant. But, oh well. I shouldn't judge. I'm sure they are really nice frshmen out there - i just have yet to find one. This one PITA keeps rubbing up against me and suff. He saying things like, ""Hey baby,"" and ""If we can't touch the chemicals, I hope your not one"". Ugh.. so gross. He earlier just when and rubbed against my back in a sexual manner.. if you know what i mean. Le disgusting. Then he keeps telling people in school that i want him or i want to go out with him. I am so uninterested in guys 15 or younger - perferably 16, my age. It's so gross when the follow me..."

I don't really know what to write. 

Well, My real name is Leeandra, I chose elysiumcrystal because it was pretty and its one of my characters name. Well, yeah.. Let me tell about myself, i guess.

I am 17, about 5'5'' and stuff. I started out with blonde hair, then i when to purple, then blue, then black, then black again, then purple again. I have olive green eyes with orange speckles. (I love my eyes!)

I go to a tech school, and i major in Environmental Technology. It's okay, i guess. What i want to focus on is art. I don't really know what part of it though. Maybe anime, web comics, or video games. I don't really know.

I like alot of things too. Obiviously art, videogames and art but i like other stuff too. I like just hanging out with my friends, listing to music, and well, i am really big into porn! ^_^ I don't know why, its just so sexy."

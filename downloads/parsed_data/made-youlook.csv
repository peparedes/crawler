last night i, with four of my friends, slept on the hardest floor ever in a nice size, but tiny, single room. woke up at 4.30 this morning. yes i said 4.30. better known as the ass crack of dawn. and sat at the bursars office for four hours. 

why you ask? to make sure i got my rightfully deserved spot on the italy jan term trip. and son, i did. you best believe i would do something like that to get what i want. we were the first ones there and i was number 2 in line. go me. the office didnt open until 8.30 and by 5.30-6 there was already 20 some people there. ( there were 35 spots) so i am happy that i didnt wait to go and sit. 

im so pumped now though. im so excited about going and it cant come soon enough! NOW, all i need is to come up with money to take with me. should be fun since i am not working all that much. and still have christmas presents and such to buy in the near future. ill make it happen. somehow. 

four hours of sleep was totally worth it."

but it is nice to be back t school with all of my friends. well...actually. a lot of my friends, the ones that i was really friends with last year are no longer around for one reason or another.   (a bunch of people graduated and a few are studying abroad.) witch in that respect is awesome for them but sucks for me. so, i am expecting hurdle after hurdle this semester and i am hoing that i pass with flying colors.

oh man, yesterday was the last day of camp. and my last day of working in that place. this summer was the breaking point with me. it has gotten so ridiculous that its not even funny anymore. the stunts that they pulled. every decision they made this summer was for the good of themselves, not the kids. when you would think that your intitution is there and has always been there for kids. nope, it doesnt seem like they were in the tought process what so ever. insane. im so happy its over. 

but at the same time, i cant believe that it is. that was a ten week camp, and its gone. life goes back to where i left it off. back to school. back to routine. back to reality. dont get me wrong, im excite to go back. but it would just be nice to be able to live there for a while before having to jump right back into the work load. wouldnt that be nice. im anticipating a rough semester. in many different aspects. but! i didnt get some more information on the italy jan term trip and im so pumped! all i have to do now is make sure i get $1000 into the adviser on september 22nd and im good to go. then make sure i have enough money to pay off the rest of the trip. and live. hmm..living. that might be a little difficult this time around. i have to do more cooking now because i hardly use meals up and daddy doenst like that and now i hardly have any meals. maybe now ill begin to learn how to cook better and ill be able to survive down the line. that would be nice.

excuses:
ive just had no time to! i work two jobs and by the time i get home at 10pm im just to beat to actually do them. but does it count that i think really hard about doing them??

and!..

it hurts! i had surgery for a reason people. it hurts when i do anything for too long of a period. 

thats about all i got. but its the truth. i jut hope that she isnt to upset with me for not doing them everyday. or more than twice. we'll see i guess. 

other than that, my life is not to exciting at the moment. 

less than i month until i go back to school. thats something exciting i suppose. ill be glad to be back and back in the swing of things but no ones ganna be there next semester. people are studying abroad. people graduated. its just not ganna be the same! and my housing situation is ganna suck my non-existent balls. not really looking foward to that at all. but what are ya ganna do. nothing. suck it up.

okay, first week of camp is over. WOO-HOO!! it wasnt as bad as i expected it to be thought. i love how i do that. think things are going to be SO unbearably bad and then its not. it makes me feel really good when things are over. and doesnt stress me out as much. so i win. but it was really a good week. the first three days i had this one group and they were good kids. not to mention that the two TSS workers, dont ask me what TSS stands for i have yet to figure that one out and ive been doing there for a couple of years, but they were really good looking. so that was fun. and then thursday and friday i was a free spirit. and days like that are AWE-SOME. oh yes. i got to walk around the building and go with whatever group i wished and got paid for it. man, if there were more days like that..i dont really know but i would be really happy. 
and i was suppose to go work at the restaurant tonight but they didnt know if i was going to come in so they got someone else to do my job. again, awesome. i just got finished watching kids, more like standing in the sun, for 8 1/2 hours, sure ill go home and sit on the couch for awhile. sweet deal. 

so now i am here. typing this out for you all to read and who knows if you all are even ganna read it. so its really just to boast my ego thinking that people actually care about what i have to say and how my week was. hahaha i know you all are so desperate to wonder what ive been up so. hahaha but anyway. im feelin really good tonight. and i want to go out ans drink a little (after my uber hard week i had) but who knows what im ganna do. nike shox are on sale at lady foot locker. maybe ill go spend some money that i dont have. or maybe ill go to the movies. who knows. who knows where the wind is going to blow me today. i would like to go apply at more places. i need a new second job. well, maybe. things are still on the fence about this one. 

but i think im ganna go now. so i hope you enjoyed reading about my week and are one your toes about when i'll have to say next. keep your eye out.

so its about eight there now and if he does come online today it would be until about six our time, 1 am his time. this is ganna be a challenge at first. then when i start working my two jobs, its ganna be rough. but i have faith! haha. things will be good. im ganna go out to hallmark and get some cards to send him. snail mail is ganna be fun. i dont care if it takes long, i love getting letters in the mail, especially if im anticipating them. and its romantic. im a hopeless romantic. so snail mail is ganna make summer fun.

why did we put it in the bottle in the first place?"

spring fling was fun. it rained so it was in the guy which kinda blew. it would have been a lot better if the weather was nice and it could have been outside. like today, it was beautiful out. but it was fun, got really drunk nd convinced andreas to go to baltimore. that was cool. he took me to this little greek restaurant and had probably the BEST crab cake EVER. and all the other food was really good as well. it was neat. apparently he used to work there and it was nice seeing him talk greek and all that. it looked so happy and comfortable and i enjoyed seeing him like that. then we went to his friends place and hung out and crashed there for the night. got back here tonight. so all in all, the weekend was a good one. now i have to do all this work and its ganna be fun! for now, im ganna go and get some things done. going to meet andreas in the library to get some work done. hmm...things are good."

"event","so im going home tomorrow, which i wasnt planning on it. but my car broke the last time i was home, last weekend. and i have to go pick it up. so thats why i am going again. and ah, andreas is coming with me. now, dont get me wrong, im really happy hes coming with me. it sucked being away from him last weekend and him joining me i will have someone to drive with but meeting my parents and all, SCARY. haha. im kinda nervous. im a lot more nervous than he is. its just that this all is moving so fast. and i really really like him and i know he feels the same. we just connected on such a level and its great. its just fast and catching me off guard. but its exciting too.  im so confused. lol. but im happy hes coming, and hes happy he is too, which calms me. and its really ganna be so much better than what im expecting. it sure is going to be an interesting time.

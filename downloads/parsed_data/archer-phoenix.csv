"event","Hello all,
Long time no post. I really hope I didn't start my last entry like that. Well lots of stuff has been going on. For starters I got my boy still. Since 10/13/2004. Still happily dating a Canadian. He is actually en route to here now. Yeah! Still doing the RA thing. Haven't jumped in a while, bullsh!t. School is caring on as usual. Lame! My house got broken into by some assh*les and if I ever find them they are freaking dead. Living on campus is great, I really missed it. My apartment mates are great. If only we could bomb our next door neighbors who at this exact time are yelling about something. Besides that all is well. My sister is getting remarried in May to her boyfriend Al. Which should be fun. Picking out dresses on sunday. Soo that is all. I hope that all is well for everyone else. Bye 4 Now

"event","Ahhh......Live Journal. It hasn't been too long. I started lifeguarding and it has been cool. I spent 5 hours in the blazing heat today, which was ok I suppose. I loved when all the kids left soo I could swim and go down the slide. The slide is sweet! It is covered and spiral. Good Times! Today I got to hang out with my on again off again friend Melissa. She is now living with her gf in Melrose, really close to my house. I still haven't met her girl yet, but she seems really cool. She even went to SSC! GO VIKINGS!! enough of that. I went and saw Harry Potter on the opening day, because I am a geek. I liked it even though it was missing crucial parts from the book. Still good though. Tommorrow I get to lifeguard a canoeing classs, which should be interesting and then I am going skydiving for the weekend. Next week starts the camps at the YMCA which means I start my 20 hours a week. Yeah Money!! Primus is playing at the Pavillion on Wednesday tix are $40 , but I don't know anyone who would go. Damn me and my lack of friends. We got a hot tub and are in the process of setting up everything soo it will work. Fun Fun!! and with having said that my mom is going away for the first weekend in July and I don't have drill!! Soo a possible party is in the makings. Who knows though. Skydiving might be a better idea. We shall see. That is about all I have now, soo I will update when more happens. Ohh one last thing... I dyed my hair normal brown and then a wine/red over it. I think it looks cool. I liked being blonde but being a lifeuard I was getting much too tan to be a blonde and it started getting green from the chlorine. Ok now really that is it.

"event","I just got home today, I have been at Skydive New England since May 13. Lots of good times, even though I only jumped 20 times. Lots of good times. Lots and Lots. Hung out with many cool people and only slept in my tent 5 times alone. Go me!! Over cute Tandem instructor of last season, mainly so I can focus on new Aussie Tandem Instructor. One word. DREDS!!

"event","Well I guess this is my monthly update. I tend to only update once a month, I suck. Well starting in August I will be back to updating constantly, once I move on campus. Last couple of days I have been hanging out at school. There was the big horseshoe party on Wednesday and I decided to go. I got really drunk and smoked a little. It was just a really interesting concept to be able to walk around the horeshoe and just drink infront of the campus police. It was pretty fun and there was about 600 people there. Completely different than FSC. Then I went to my school's 150th Bday party they were giving out great prizes like laptops, digital cameras, TV's and stuff like that. I won the new No Doubt CD. Wow! Well the party was fun though. We also had a SAAC, (student athletes something something)  meeting and an RA(Resident Assistant) meeting. I slept over TB's place. The SAAC meeting was fun free food. It is odd though they are like "" You might walk past an athlete in the hall and not even know"" I was thinking would I really care if I saw an athlete and how would I feel if someone was like ""you are an athlete"" to me. It's not like I don't want people to know, but I don't want to be percieved as a Jock. The RA stuff is crazy we are going on an overnight trip to an island and doing some team builder or something. Crazy stuff. I also move in an entire month before everyone else does. Argh! Can't wait till my finals are done. I have 2 left. Then I go skydiving for 2 weeks striaght if anyone wants to visit me give me a call and go here for directions http://www.skydivene.com/jDirections.html#anchor lebanon
I leave next thursday and won't be back until June 1st. My cellphone sometimes works, take the chance and call first. Bit for now that is all."

"event","Soo, its been a while let me catch you up: Still not really with Jay, got my Lifeguard certification, still doing the school thing, Got and RA position in the 21+ drinking dorm in the fall, and the Drop Zone opened a couple of weeks ago. Ok caught up?? Soo went and saw Kill Bill volume 2 with Sherina on Friday, realy good movie. Can't wait till its relleased it will be cool to watch them together. Saturday woke up and went to the DropZone. Got there around noon and the first load still didn't go up crazy? Well the plane was having issues, shortly later the plane was good. Couldn't find anyone that was free to do a refresher jump with me, soo just cholled and met a chick named Jenny who goes to Monserat in Beverly, she was pretty cool she couldn't jump, because she was AFF and they were on a wind hold. Soo watching people jump, 2 cutaways, including 1 off a tandem, then the last jump 7 people landed off. 5 in trees, 1 on a road 8 miles away and 1 in some power lines. Everyone was fine, but they were in the front page of teh sunday paper in Maine. Then Saturday night took some pills, and shrooms and drank. Needless to say it was a good time. Stayed up really late like 4 or 5 am then got up at 8am to jump. Eveyone was draggin ass. I was just sitting there chilling and Mikey came over and was like ok you and me are on the 2nd load. Let me recap. Last season I had such a crush on Mikey and the first jump I did with him I was retarded and couldn't get off the plane, how freaking embarrassing. Well yesterday, I was nervous and we jumped and everything was going fine, then I docked him and he leaned over and kissed me. Inflight kiss. How feaking cool was that. I think I was a little shocked at the time. We fell forever it felt and he actually had to check my altimeter because he thought that his was broken. I thought it was pretty freaking funny. Landed fine but away from the ""P"". Second jump of the day was supposed to be a 2 way but it didn't happen. Landed again far from the ""P"". Last jump had a pretty successful 2 way and landed on the ""P"". Yeah!! I am soo glad to be jumping again. I feel soo much better and centered again. I can breathe!! That was lame but whatever. Sunday's party was pretty lame, but I hung out and talked to Greg MacBeth, who is pretty dam cool and wo has 2 very successful skydiving sons. He was a pretty cool, down to earth guy. He owns a DZ in Canada, so if I ever go to Canda I will probably check it out. And really that is all from this weekend. I did the first half of the Professional CPR and First Aid class I need to do for Lifeguarding and then I am done, but I have 3 tests this week. including Math, Music and Anatomy. Its going to be a stressful week and then I go and visit my Aunt Kay for the weekend. Can't jump for 3 weeks. I have drill the following week after Aunt Kay's. I think when school is all over with I am going to go to the DZ for a week or 2 at a time. I think that would be freaking cool. I will have to stock up on food first though, or I will be poor. Well should be getting ready for school and such. It will be good to sleep in a bed tonight. I will hopefully update soon, but you never know with me.

"event","We got our puppy on saturday. She is soo cute, but she keeps peeing and crapping all over the place. Went to Framingham and then to Hampden to go to Becky's party with Tony. Good times. Evil Nick is really hot! Went home and did the stupid sychronized swimming paper, which is due tomorrow. Got my math test back, I got a 90 could have easily gotten 100, but I screwed up the sign. Hopefully will get back my music test. I have to do my presentation tomorrow, as well as finally disect the piggy pig. I also have to bring Shadow and Morgan to the vet tomorrow. I went up to Skydive New England today and got my jumpsuit I will probably have a picture of it soon. I also gave them $700 soo I have a block of 100 jumps on my account for next season. I want to have at least 200 jumps by the fall, we will see. Jay is coming down tomorrow, which is cool I haven't seen him in a while. We have drill this weekend and we are going to see the Vagina Monologues on Saturday with Sherina so that should be  fun. Then a music test on friday. Busy Busy. I can't wait till Spring Break even though I am not going to be doing much, but there is no work that I really need to do. After I get back to school after Spring Break I find out about the RA position. I am really nervous about that. I am not sure how I did, and I don't want to be over confident about it, because I will be really upset if I don't get it. I am trying to forget about it and then just get it and not think about it all the time, but it is something big. I am going to be starting lifeguarding certification in the end of the month. Swimming 5 days a week Damn! And that is about all for now."

I would really love to be an RA next semester, but who knows. Unfortunately I will not know until after spring break, which is like a month away... I hear you shiver with antici......pation! Soo yeah that is that. Swimming is going ok I am going to go for my lifeguard certification next month I think that would be a good job. I have a new love interest but nothing more than interest he is cool, but that is it. I am supposed to go to Becky's party this wekend, but I need to find out if it was saturday or friday. We are getting my puppy finally this weekend and I kind of want to be there when she gets home soo I guess I need to find out the timing of the party so I can see what the time schedule is going to be. I am also probably going to stay at Tony's friday soo we can be together to go to Becky's but I DON'T KNOW!!! ERGH!!! I need to pick up some fungus. Then I don't have to drink at Becky's. I love when there is some fungus amoung us. Yeah anyways, I digress I have soo much work to do. We are disecting a piggy piggy on wednesday. Oink! that is about it."

"event","It has been a while I think October. Well fall semester has ended I got 2 A's and 2 B's that is the best I have ever done, especially since I missed an entire year of school. Over the winter break I went to Florida with Jay and I saw Kevin, which was pretty cool. I also jumped 12 times out of assorted airplanes and 3 times out of a helicopter. Fun stuff. During that time however I had the flu, a sinus infection, which ended up making me pop a blood vessel in my sinus cavity while in free-fall, a corneal abrasion, strep throat and almost breaking my elbow while doing a floating exit off a Porter while attempting a ""69"" position formation for my friend's 69th jump. All in all it was a great time. 22 hours each way. I then went to Maine to see my Aunt and that was also a lot of fun. I then hung out with Tony, I seem to do that once a month or so. This last time we did some shrooms and it was all good. The next day I went to Becky's house in the middle of no-where Massachusetts and enjoyed myself at a party there. There was a bunch of people there and it was an overall good time. I really don't like drinking very much I would rather smoke or do some other type of natural occurring drug. I fought my way home in the snowstorm and made it home in one piece. 2 days later I started school I have Fitness Swimming which is an actually hard class, but I am one of the top swimmer's in my class!Go Me! Then Voice Class, I am going to be a singer, Precalculus Eww Math, and Anatomy and Physiology 2, yeah Biology. I also went to my friend's wedding. Jennie got married, finally! Still no job, but that's ok. Lots of studying and stuff. That is about it for now. I am not promising anything, but I will attempt to update more frequently."

"event","Been a little while. Field hockey is really heating up. We lost first place to Bridgewater state, but we are in running for 2nd place against Worcester and Framingham. I would love to beat Framingham. We are playing them on saturday I really hope we win. It will be a good game no matter what. My trailer in empty now, yeah for me. I think I am going to go up there either saturday night or sunday. I can hopefully jump on sunday, but who knows, now it seems as if it will be cloudy all day. How rude. If they didn't move the game up on saturday I could go after the game, but no. Let's change the time, because we don't want to wake up early. Lazy bastards. Saturday is supposed to perfect jumping weather. I am going to hang out with Tony this weekend, which should be loads of fun. Yeah! I got my nipples pierced again the other day. I went with Sherina. Odd that she would want to get her nipple pierced it doesn't seem like that would be something that she would be into, but she has. I am goint to get them checked out today to make sure that they are healing ok. Then tomorrow after practice it's off to Framingham. Yeah!! I had to buy a new internet modem card for my computer today after it snapped off the other day, Cheap piece of crap oh well. But alas I must go I have an Organic Chemistry 2 review session for tomorrow's big test. Yeah I love school. Yeah school. I shall update later."

"event","Well it finally happened. I got my A Liscense for SkyDiving. Now I am a real skydiver. I can jump any where in the world for $20. Ohh it is exciting. Right now, however, I feel like my mind is constipated. I have not jumped since Thursday. I am going tomorrow and all weekend. Sherina and Jay are coming up with me this weekend. Sherina is doing another tandem and Jay is continuing his work on getting his class A liscense. I can't wait. This past weekend I had drill. Not a bad drill at all we shot weapons. One of the only things I am good at. Jay failed his first time around and preceeded on beating up his target. I got a 35 out of 40 and was done on my first try, which pissed him off even more. It was pouring and hard to see, so that was his excuse. It was raining when I was shooting too, but whatever. School is crappy, yesterday I had a lab that involved ether. I was breathing it in for about 3 hours. Well right after that I decided to go to field hockey practice. I was running and everything was fine, when all of a sudden I passed out. I woke up on the side of the field totally confused and perceeded to throw up for 20 minutes. It was soo much fun. Moral~ Ether is bad for your health. Field Hockey is going good. We are tied for second to last place with Framingham. I really want to beat them. THEY MUST GO DOWN!! I got to play today and I was close to scoring a goal. Someday. But that is all for now. I must say hi to Lucy now, it has been way to long since I have smoked. Bye for all now!"

Friday went up to the Drop Zone hung out did all my homework went to eat came back began drinking and then hung out at the fire. Ended up getting pretty drunk and I finally hooked up with ""Mikey"" No sex, but lot's of fun. We have a good understanding of each other. Just fun no relationship. Saturday still crappy weather but made the best of it hung out in the hanger for most of the day with the crazy sky divers. Then went on a 4-wheeler ride with one of the guys. Thoose things rock. I got really dirty and had to change though. Then the bad showed up. The bassist had dreds. Oh god was he hot. The  band, sliding G( I think), were rediculous. They were like bluesish Jazz. There was a whole brass section. They were really good. Sometime during the band I was invited to do some Shrooms. I have never really done any before. Soo I was a little nervous. Luckily it was a great time. I had my electron named Eric that I was hugging the whole night. Good times. Then at 0420 it as time for bed, I finally found my bed 30 minutes later and then had a 2 hour conversation between tents with my electron and Bill. We were talking about eating a CheeseBurger during freefall. Which will be done in 2 weeks. Woke up this moring feeling good,broke down my tent ate. Said good-bye to everybody including Mikey and went home. Boy I hate being home. But next summer I have a trailer up there soo I am going to move up there in April and stay until September. Good times. Everyone should come next year. I didn't even jump this whole weekend, but I had loads of fun. Time to get back to reality and get some homework done. Bye all!"

I should be getting my liscense on saturday. I also might be able to get lucky with the hot tandem guy ""Mikey"". Soo hot!! Damn would that be nice. I am learning how to pack a parachute tomorrow night I am going to jump my own packing on Thursday or Saturday. Skydiving is the most exciting thing I have ever done. I hope to be able to live up there next summer. That would be soo very cool. We were supposed to have a field hockey game today, but the weather prevented that. Unfortunately we are having a game tomorrow, but I already made plans. Oh well. Skydiving will always be more important than field hockey. And that is about all.

But now it changes. I started field hockey last week we had our first scrimage and we did well besides the fact that we lost. We lost 5-3 which is a high score for F.H. We are unfortunately not going to Westfield State soo I can't visit Becky we are goign to FSC so Tony said he wouold come and see me. I don't know how many other people go there that I know. Possibly Kazzy and Meagan. Well it's the last saturday in October at 9am. Today was my last day working at Hot Topic. I quit soo I can focus on school, F.H and skydiving. Yeah what a life.I also have a new frog named Trevor after Neville Longbottom's frog. I am a Harry Potter geek. I just finished the Order of the Phoenix.

I haven't been in school for 1 year and I am taking 2 of my core required science labs. So with that I will have to talk it over with my manager. I'm nervous about school, but optimistic. In other news. I did karate on the beach on saturday and then camped out at Skydive New England from monday to wednesday morning in that 3 day period I was only able to jump once. So I decided to go back on Thursday and I jumped 3 times. I am now currently on level 4. Which means during this jump I only jump out with one person holding on to me and then when we level out he lets go. I have to turn to him, move towards him and then turn away and deploy at the right altitude. It will take 2-3 jumps to go to level 5 before I get to that level I have to jump out alone and look out the plane and find where I am going to land. Scary shit. I am going to jump again on monday. I ned to have at least 24 jumps to get my liscense and I now have 5. WOW!! Well I am going to leave for karate sson. I will post again soon."

Only a couple of days now. I was going to sleep over there on sunday night, but there might be a thunderstorm soo a tent seems out of the question. So I will just leave her at about 9:30 to be there around 11 for class. I would rather go with someone,but I am going to have to get used to this if I want my liscense ASAP. They are having an award ceremony on saturday for my company. It should be exciting I am pretty sure that I am getting an award. I have to dye my hair soon though. Ehhh!! Army. Well after all it is my own stupidity that I am stuck in the army. soo no one to blame but myslef.I think that Jay failed his second consecutive drug test. Way to go Jay.

She slept over my house Sunday night and then I slept over her house Monday night. We hung out in Harvard Square today it was a lot of fun. I bought theese awesome sandlas from Hootenany and this Punky Brewsteresque dress from the Garmet District I then went by the grave and said ""Hi"" to my dad and stayed there for about 30 minutes talking to him about this and that. It was kind of nice and I had to try really hard to leave. It was soo peaceful there. I have since been working on my room. It is pretty destroyed since I moved it around a couple of days ago. I got my skydiving pictures back yesterday, as you can see from my icon, they came out great. I got one blown up and I have it on my wall. I am going to make a collection of skydiving stuff on that wall. We got this rediculously big TV the other day. It is 52 inches. that is like 4.5 feet. It is crazy big. Which means when I have my pseudo parties in August we will have to watch my skydiving movie on it. Anyone is welcome to come. August 13-15. Mid-week. Ehh! who cares. I am going to extend the invitation to all the people that I work with and hope that they can come. I know Becky can't boo on her. But again anyone else can come. ok the Golden Girls will be starting soon and I am sick of the computer. Bye all!
P.S 6 days until I can fly again!!"

At work I met Lacuna Coil and then I went to see them on Friday with Type O Negative with Tony, Becky and her friend Tarra. Then I worked and had a meeting at work and went out to breakfast. I then bleached my hair. And that is that. I have been really busy lastely. I am going for my first advanced tandem progression class next monday. I am going to end up going up there at least once a week until I get certified to jump alone. Hopefully before November, because word has it that I might be deploying again. With all that said I must go to guitar center to get some wall holders and stuff. If anyone wants to come with my skydiving you can just tell me because I need to reseve people. that is all."

"event","I have been kind of busy lately. I went to 6 Flags on Tuesday last week with Sherina, Jay and the onion. It was loads of fun. The onion is really a pot-head though. I think that we were high for the first couple of rides. It was cool. We went to the water park side for a bit and mainly just chilled on the adventure river which was pretty cool in itself. Jay went to drill yesterday which means I probably won't be seeing him for 2 weeks, because it is the yearly 2 week drill. Thank God I don't have to do one of thoose this year. I would be pretty pissed off if I had too seeing I was already gone for 9 months. I am not even sure if I have drill in 2 weeks if I don't I will be kind of annoyed, because I haven't danced since 6 flags and that is really annoying. It is probably for the best I have to get used to this, but it is still annoying. I am going sky diving on thursday with some people from work. I am really excited I am trying to have a small slumber party the night before with some of the girls that are going, but we will see how that goes. My mom already said that I could have 3 people sleep over( WOW that sounds really lame) anyways. I am supposed to be hanging out with Melissa tomorrow after she gets out of work. Let's hope that works, it usually does. I began reading the Harry Potter series last night I am already 1/2 way done the 2nd book. It is really hard putting them down. Karate has been great lately. I took a week break, because of work and things I had to do. I learned an entire staff form in one class. It is pretty cool. I don't think that the staff is my weapon though. Work is annoyying but it gives me money, somtimes. That is all for now."

"event","It has been a while since I have actually updated. I went to Maine last week sometime, It was good to see my Aunt Kay. I got my septum pierced 2 weeks ago also. It hurt like a bitch, but I like it. I have been working as usual. Nothing spectalcular. I celebrated the 4th at home with DELISH across the street from my house on the rox high above the park. It was pretty cool. There was frieworks surrounding us. How nice! I am soo bored out of my mind right now it is pretty pathetic. I hate not having friends that are closer. Or Jay having a cell phone. I hate the fact that I don't know what Jay and I are. Sometimes he thinks of me all the time and he calls me and invites me to hang out with him or come down and see me, and then there are other times that he doesn't call me at all. He is playing games with my head and it is annoying me. I bought some new fish. My fish rock. If I end up doing nothing tonight, which it looks like I am going to do. I might go to Karate at 9am tomorrow. Maybe after I will call Jay or he can just go to Hell! Errrr!!! He called me on the 4th and I didn't call him back. I wonder if he is waiting 4 me to call him? Ehh I don't care. It's not that I want to hang out with him specifically I just want to not drive and hang either here or drive somewhere close, have sex and sleep there. Jay fits all those qualities. I can't wait to school starts up again. I am determined to meet people and actually get friends this year. I am going to a school that is in the next town away, which means that the people that go there will live close by. I will be in relation to the school as Tony is to FSC. That should be fun. Until then work at Hot Topic and waste my summer away. I am, however, going to go SkyDiving this summer. Next month sometime. Of anyone wants to come they are welcome. I am trying to make an event going up there. That is all sweet chariot, I must go!"

"event","The last couple of days were ok. Went to Tony's last week sometime. It was pretty cool seeing him. Even though he did give me a concussion... ehh whatever what is a little brain bending between friends? Being 21 with Tony opens up a lot more things to do too... like now we can go to a bar and drink or go to a liquour store to go drink or get drunk at TGIFridays. Work had sucked and it will suck a lot more tomorrow because it is inventory which means they want me to work from 6pm to 2am how freaking cool?? But I digress. I have been dancing for like 2 weeks solid and I kind of like it. I think better when I dance. I think I will continue. All they need to do is legalize the dance and it will be great. I need to travel to the other side of the state and see an ex-roomie soon. I am going to have 3 party days at the end of the summer at my house. They will most likely be on August 12-15 but I don't know for  sure. Everyone is invited again and I hope that more people show this time. I miss Jay because I am freaking pathetic. And that is all I have to say about that."

Ohh I am going to have another get together soon. All are invited it won't be until August and it will be in the middle of the week, but it is for 3 days and people can show up and stay for the entire duration. The pool will be open too which is good. A pool party I guess. I hope it is not in field hockey season. That would be bad. Well today I am going to visit a friend in the western part of the state. Not as far west as some people, Becklyn, but west enough for me. Should be a good time. I hope. Haven't seen them in about 2 or 3 years. Work is going fine. I went swimming in my pool a couple of times already too, even if it is way too cold. Saw Finding Nemo with Sherina and Jay the other day. What a great movie! I hung out with Sandi after work and them we went back to MArk's house and hung out there until around 4 when I went home. When I got home found my cell phone and saw Melissa called me, Sorry melissa! Kind of tired, but I have to leave to get on the road soon. So I am off. Bye for now. Will update soon."

You are on the lookout for the parent to your future children - and Cancer fits the bill!<br>
<br>
The only downside to your Cancer's incredible love is that they tend to be possessive.<br>
Cancers don't want to spend so much time caring for someone, only to be left later on!<br>
So, they are a your Cancer may be a bit guarded at first and more prone to jealousy.<br>
<br>
Take care of your Cancer's insecurities, and your relationship will be a success.<br>
In return, you'll find the deepest love you've ever known...<br>
As well as the freedom to express your emotions openly, especially during sex.

I weighed myself 169. I want to lose about 15 pounds. She told me not to lose more than 15 because of the way my body is shaped, like muscles and bones, that it wouldn't be healthy. So now I am on a diet. I know I have the exercise thing down now it is just the food thing. I am going to start small. Like cutting back on juices and dairy and limiting fast food to once a week that includes dunks. Which is hard becasue when ever Jay and I go for burn runs we go by dunks. This is going to be hard,but I want to lose it.  I am going to help open a store down on the cape. I will be accompanied by Ryan a friend from work. Should be fun. I hung out with Sandi and Melissa the other day. And sometime last week I hung out with Sandi amd Mark and went to their houses Sandi is an amazing artist. She showed me some of her work and it is crazy. I love it. Well that is all for now."

I bought these great shoes that were like $35 for $4.59 and this cool shirt that was $20 for $3.58 I also bought hair chopsticks for $0.39. How cool is that? Then Sandi and I went to my house and talked about this and that and waited for Melissa to come over and pick us up to go to the Diesel Cafe. I enjoyed some Naked juice, a vegan friendly cookie and a Ceasar Salad. I met Sandi's friend Mark who is really cool and we just sat and talked and ate. It was fabulous. I am working tomorrow also. Closing with Sandi. I have a great outfit planned for clubbing after the pride march. I am excited. I also joined a LJ community called Pride Goth. It is pretty cool it is for GLBT members that are Goth. How great is that?? Well that is all for now. I am going to go to sleep now. I will update soon."

He invites me over, well here is the proble he lives in Salem NH, I live in Lynn Ma. Only a 45 minute drive, but I would get really stoned and then have to drive home and that is just bad all around. Then I have Melissa that is going to live in Sommervile which is much closer, but not close enough to not bring my car or worry about parking. Then there is Sandi whom also lives in Sommerville, but it is against store policy to hang out with her. Then we got Becky who live in the dip of ma. soo that really means I have to find new and exciting friends. Maybe in Salem State, but there are no cool Biology or Chemistry people in Salem. In FSC there was Meagan and Sarah and they rocked but I have not found any cool people outin Salem yet. I will keep searching. I am looking forward to the 3 karate events coming up and the GAY PRIDE parade in Boston(I put this in caps to attract Jxmes if he is skimming)Well that is happening on June 14 in Boston and I am going with a bunch of people it shoud be really fun. My first ever. Still searching for a girl friend. No luck, but as everyone has been saying when you look for one you will never find one. You just have to let one find you. Or some bullshit like that. Well I am surprisingly tired right now, so I think that I might try to catch the Golden Girls and the Nanny. Night all"

"event","Orientation was ok yesterday. I got to be special and cut everone because I am a readmit. Yeah me! I was out of there at about noon. I went to the pool to see if my stuff was still there from before I left and it was. How amazing is that? Well I decided that I risked my stuff getting thrown out long enough soo I brought it home. I got all the classes I wanted and I am a sophomore again. I am taking Anatomy & Physiology I, Organic Chemistry II, Compostion I and Gender & Society. I have 8:30's every day except Thursday and I get out at 12:15 every day except Monday. So it is not too bad. I don't have any days off though. I don't think I will ever have days off. I never did in Framingham soo I doubt that I ever will in Salem. I joined 2 clubs and a sport too. I am in the Allianace(GLBT) and the Biology Society and I am going to play Field Hockey. I am really excited about this fall. In other news I cut Jay off in the sex department. He was ok with it I guess, and it is even cooler because he wants to keep me as a friend no matter what. So that makes me feel great. I hate the fact that I can't be with him. I mean I really do love him, but ever since we started going out I knew there was something missing. I guess it is all for the better. Well I have to work in about 1.5 hours soo I must go and eat and stuff. Until then.."

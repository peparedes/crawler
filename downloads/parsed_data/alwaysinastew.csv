"event","I just haven't felt the urge to write in the last couple weeks. The whole business with school and the professors and Harry Potter going missing and then not got me into a bit of a rut. 

Girlfriend and I have been through about thirty of the flavours of ice cream at the shop down the road. We've still got something like seventy more. I swear I'm going to have to get an entirely new wardrobe before I go to Beauxbatons. Come to think, that might not be a bad thought, since we're not going to be in the cold climate of Hogwarts.

I think it's time for another three flavours, Ele. Be ready in a little while?"

Okay. Celebration finished. Now for the yelling and pointing of fingers. Girlfriend, we have had entirely too little ice cream. I insist that I escort you to the ice cream parlour immediately."

"event","Well. It looks like I'm not the only late-comer here. That's good. I'd rather not be mocked for it. 

I don't really have much to say. It's the end of the year. We're all about to go home. Sad, yes, but true. At least Ele's close still. El, love, we're going to have to do some major hanging out this summer. I don't want to be bored like last summer. 

I'm going now. See you next time!"

We played suites with skip. yeah.  i was kinda scared bc it had been my first time drinking since the accident but it was fine.. i only had one beer anyway.. then we left and went to stephs house and we set up the tent and stuff.. We hung out for a while then went back to hammers well that was a greeeeaaattt fucking idea.  we got there and seriously with in two min. the cops fucking showed up - just my luck right. well some people ran but the majority stayed in the house- -  it was just more safe that way.  and we had already seen the lights outside.  Well after hiding out for a while in the house and being soo scared it was clear.  it was kind of fun though- - like running from the cops and stuff like that gives us such a rush haha weird.. yeahh so we made it back safely and everything was okay thank GOD! 

Today we woke up early and dropped renee fucking keen off at work.  then we went back to stephs and had some AwEsOmE shreck cereal.. HAHA and if you look at shreck closely when he makes that goofey grin you will realize that he looks kinda like shane - -  good call jess.

We bonded pretty well and im really looking forward to this season... we played sooo well we were the camp CHAMPS wahoo GO UM- we were undefeated the whole time 8-0 yay.  The sesions werent too too bad at least it wasnt as hot as last year.  But it was a hike to get to the field, last year our dorms were a lot closer to the field and cafeteria ohh well.  I roomed with MeG and oh it was good times. ((yeahh isnt it great)) haha.  Our team would go crazy at night it was soo much FUN.  good times reading cosmopolitan outloud with the whole team ha.  Brooke was our coach she was super nice and fun.  but the last day she was not able to stay for our last game which was kind of sad.  E Face was there all week which i wasn't expecting but that wasn't too bad.  and haa he sang the national anthem for our last game on thur. well today. haha it was great.  Yeahh we had some crazy wars with Tina destrought team member.  Yeah it was funnnnny (ya had to be there).

Well i just came in from outsiiide-  i was laying out getting tan- i LOVE being tan its awesome.  So today so far i woke up watched some TV made maself breakfast bc im a good cook like that- and then did some chores- bc im a good kid like that. Then i layed out- and im gonna watch some more TV- work out a little- then clean some more- then take a shower bc i am just that freaking COOL.

Last night was pretty fun!! Nicole came over and i made us some dinner, then we went to the Legion game that was at Methacton.  That was fun times- they lost but me nicole and jessie had fun!  After the game Nicole and I went over Tricias house watched some TV and then went to prettucies!  Nicole and Tricia ate the monster- i wasn't hungry for any ice cream or anything- we saw Sar Boogs, Jaxx, and Laura there too it was fun.  After that we went back to Tricia's for a while she went inside and showered and Nicole and I sat out on the ground and made some phone calls.  There was NOTHIGN to do.  Okay from here on out i am going to tell a story about last night- some of you might want to stop reading so for those of you who are interested- it's Story Time kiddies- -

Alright so we were bored- and I had talked to Matt Gledhill and he was working or whatever- well he works at Bed Bath & Beyond- so we decided we would give him a surprise visit! were nice right? well they were closed so we couldn't- so we just sat in the car in the parking lot forever annd we were going to leave- so i put a note on Matts car saying hey and how we were going to visit and crap- we left and i decided we were being creepy so we wanted to take the note off of his car.  So we drove around a little- then parked near Michaels Deli bc Nicole had to use the potty- then we walked up to the Bed Bath & Beyond parking lot.  Well there was this shopping cart there and I wanted to use it.  So Nicole pushed me in it over to Matts car where I took off the note that we had left for him- when we were leaving (( me still in the cart )) Nicole thought she saw someone and tried to turn realll quick but the shopping cart didn't want to do that so it tiped over and i fell out and ouch! it hurt haha it was soooo funny my phone got all scraped up i got a big bruise on ma knee but it was fun- you HAD to be there!  So we decided we wanted to steal the shopping cart. sooo nicole brought the car around and i tried to put it in the car- And the DaMn thing would not fit in the trunk or the backseat- and as i am trying my hardest to fit this thing in the car I turn around and see this security gaurd walking towards me!! so i threw the cart and closed allll the doors and got in the car and we sped away! but he was sooo creepy he came out of NOWHERE and the way he was walking reminded me of the cop in the movie terminater haa it was crazzy.  So we were still in a stealing mood for some reason- we drove to the renasainse - and stole a cone- then we saw another one it was cute and skinnier then the other one and stuff so Nicole was like just reach out the window and grab it- so that i did only i couldnt reach it and well her car has the kind of seat belts that automaticaly slide haha and when i tried to open the door i was still like hanging out the window and i got all tangled up in the seatbelt haha- but i did manage to get the cone!! wow that was crazzy fun. then we went over Steven Palma's house for a little and watched some TV and looked at pictures!! thats alllll- sorry i just wrote so much i just got so caught up in my story- phew! okay ill let ya go kids thats all the stories for today-

But Nicole fell down the hill right on her ass- then Tricia fell and almost pulled the trash can along with her- ahh it was greAt.

Today i am doing a lot better.  I got my wisdom teeth out on Friday annnd it really wasn't all that bad.  I haven't been in like any pain and im not real swollen at all.  Well the fact that im not in any pain has something to do with me taking so many damn pills that my mom hid them from me!  I started with 16 and the second day i only had 5 left- - thats bad because your only supposed to take them every 5 hours but your not really supposed to take more then like 4 a day.  I just kept taking more when my mom wasnt looking.  and Miller told me to take them quick so i took 2 with in a half hour - yeah im OD'n just kiddin :/ umm yeah so its not too bad. And let me tell ya these pills fucking get to ya. its cooool

I was pretty much living on my couch for two days- lots of water ice though thats the good part.  Annnd oMg i was going to kill the Phillies i stayed up allll night sat watching them play 16 fucking innings and then losing - WTF.

so it hasn a while since i have updated.. i was away this past weekend with my parents and Brittany.  It was a lot of fun Friday night we went to the Phillies game at Fenway Park which is realllyy nice.  It was good minus the fact that the phillies got killed and it poured towards the end of the game.. ohh well.  Then saturday we went to Salem.. it was real cool we got to see a lot of neat stuff and me and Britt really like all that witch stuff because it intrests us.. not because we are withces.  Then that night we went out to eat mmmm it was yummy.. the resturant was overlooking the water it was real pretty.  Sunday we went to down town Boston that was neat .. we went on a harbor cruise and a fun trolley tour ride.. we got to shop a lot and had a good dinner at Cheers.. that was fun because i love that show it was really neat.  The weekend was fun also because Brittany and I had a lot of freedom to do whatever we wanted.  And our hotel room was sweet!! that was fun..

Well i came home to find out that people just love to talk shit and make up stories for no reason.. It's really dumb and pointless but ohh well its not true anyway so whatever .. theyll grow up sometime.

Last night i went to Wendy's with Scottie.. Christopher Thomas Michael McVoy was supposed to go too but he had to do stuff at home- - so we got there and D-Hue, bryan pants, eric, donnie,and phu were pulling in as we were.. so we talked with them then we all went in to eat or whatever.  it was fun.. Steph came too after her bball game.. they all left and i just went home.. im still grounded :(

I had work today, it wasn't too bad.. except my eyes started to really bother me because of my contacts but im better now.  thats it.. i got nothing else so cyaa

So we have this new lady at work.. well let me just say she is b e a t.  She has a mullet and some missing teeth haa.  Well Brittany and I have decided that she is very rude and we do not like her.  And our boss Mike was kinda being a jerk today.  So we got our stuff done, and went to Brittany's house, and relaxed.  Then we went downstairs to play with the hampsters haha.. well we told Sean we would be nice and clean the cage,.. so in that attempt Brit got bit by one and just dropped it and Sean got soo mad.. haa he kept yelling at us even though we were just trying to be nice hehe.  So when Britt's mommy came home she took us to the mall to go shopping to get stuff for this wknd.  She bought me a new purse and Britt and I got matching necklaces aww i love Mrs. Tallman :)

Now I am home and my tummy hurts a little bit.. We had subway for dinner mmmm yummy i <3 subway! well im gonna go watch Summerland..

So today i went into work with Britt around 11 ish.  And before that we had to get gas and stuff.. well Brit and I decided to go check out the scene of the accident. it was crazzy.. first of all i thought it was at a completley different place untill today - - its crazzy well there are all these skid marks and you can kinda figure out what we did by them.  I think we hit this parked SUV which turned out to be Courtney Little's bro's car which was parked outside of her house-- then we made a really wide right turn and went up onto the curb-- you can tell by the skid marks.. then got back onto the road and hit a telephone pole which is now on a slant!! it is nuts-- kinda scarrrry to see it too.  Also Brittany was telling me today that i did get handcuffed and drivin to the Pig Station :: yeep i deff do not remember that at all.. i thought i went straight home from the scene.. wow i was drunk.

So we got to work and had loads of stuff to do.  Sean was being mean to me as usuall and picking on me. Me and Britt were sooo lazzy and did not feel like doing anything.. but we stuck it out and got a lottt done.  So we felt like leaving after about 4 1/2 hours of complaining, and well we work in East Ntown - - and there is this nice park so we decided to go for a walk in it and see where it leads to.  Sounds fun right?! little did we know it is super long and leads into all these crazzy like corn fields and farms and stuff.  We kept walking past all of these creepy old barns and abandoned houses... and we were like getting way creeped out!  so we thought it was just one big loop but no we were wrong!! theres all these crazy paths that you can take and things to see.. it was kinda cool actually - - they have like vball nets and theres a pond and like bball and picnic areas :: it got cute.  So after walking for an hour we realized we were lost and it wasnt the simple loop we thoughtd itd be.  So we called Sean to save us HAHA.. we are idiots! well after standing on W. Germantown Pike for 15 min he saved us. we were soo hot and tired.  Next time we decided we will walk left instead of right.

After that crazzy adventure me and Britt went to Mcdonalds and met Dan there and had some foood.. then i came home. and now i am B O R E D - but i think im gonna go take a nap because i am pooped. and jeeze i just wrote a friggin book

well i have nothing to do so i decided to make an attempt at making one of these journals.. there not real easy, pretty damn complicated if you ask me. annnd this still does not look how i wanted it to.  oh well.

well today i woke up and went to church then to my Grams for lunch, it was real awkward though in the beginning but it wasn't as bad as i would have thought.  I didn't want to have to deal with seeing my family after all that i have been through this week and because of the things that they now know about me.

Yeeep i was in a car accident tuesday with Shawn Fenn. kids dont drink and drive! i am okay though, i have a concussion n some bruises and i am real sore a lot but im alive!! it was soo <b>scary</b> though.  Thats something i will never do again and i never would have if I weren't sooo messed up, yeahh i had just a little too much to drink, my badly f a i l e d breathalyzer test proves that. I was arrested and can't drive for 6 mnths!! annnd i still have to go to court to see what the judge wants me to do, i'll also have to pay a underage drinking fine. 

You just have to <b>live</b> and <i>learn</i>, and im working on that, im grounded for a little bit but it's okay i just have to take it easy.. well im gonna go -

"event","The bell rang and everyone scadaddles off to there cars, rides, or the path they will follow to get home.  Brittany and I 'help' Girard pack his stuff and all that jazz.  He then asks me to take his English books back to the library for him, which is cool because I didn't turn in my history book, so I asked him if I could just put it in there: YES.  So I try to go in front of the line, because im just returning a teacher books..they don't even acknowledge I exist.  From there, I walk inside the library and ask some fat-lady where I can drop these books off.  ""You'll probably have to wait in line.""  ""Well, I got to go soon and Girard said I could go to the front of the line and they didn't even look at me.."" ""SIGH, well, let me go ask them""  She asks the bitches that work there and comes back saying,"" Just put them right there on that counter.""  I put them down and she notices my history book.  ""Mr. Girard has a history book?""  ""No, he said I could turn it in with his books.""  ""-Shaking head- I wouldn't do that if I were you..""  ""Fine, then I'll wait in line.  Have a good summer too!""

I wait in line and turn in the god-forsaken book.  I leave the school, wake up the next morning and go down to Mexico.  All that happened there was to eat and drink, shop, look at the beach, and get robbed 100 dollars by there police [the federales].  It was scary, because I have NEVER been out of the United States and especially a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY.  So we finally get out of there, THANK THE LORD, and I'm never going back unless Jesus is held hostage there.  Monday, I saw Cars and went to the mall.  The movie was really good actually, it's pretty sad.  But, I kept in mind that there just CARS not people haha.  In the mall, I spent 40 dollars on Hana-Kimi books.  IT'S WORTH IT, TRUST ME!

Tomorrow, I'm going to Pala Casino all day to hang by the pool and a cabana and Friday is Mariel's party [which will be awesome!]

Ehh, I kind of like school and getting drilled.

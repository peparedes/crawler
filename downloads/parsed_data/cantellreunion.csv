"event","It's all over.  The reunion has been and gone, and was a great night for everybody who attended.  Virtually everyone came up to me to thank me for sorting it out, but really, all I did was bunk off work and send a few emails. The success was down to everyone.  Simple as that.

A lot of people might say that reunions are pointless.  After all, we all kept in touch with the people that really mattered, right?  

At the time, maybe.  Thing is, at sixteen, you can never really tell what somebody is like.  Saturday night proved that, featuring no cliques, no vendettas and no trouble.  I didn't hear a single person trying to do the 'how-important-I-am' thing.  We've grown up, kids.  Quite nicely too.

The only problem with Saturday night was just that there wasn't enough time - but hopefully, the event will have re-started quite a few friendships.    Thanks to everyone for making it such a decent night.

Let's not leave it as long again, eh?"

"event","As promised ( but a little late ), the votes are in and it's all decided.

It's Brannigans.

It's 7pm onward ( I'd get there early-ish )

From 7-10, we have the whole restaurant area to ourselves.  Also, during this period, anyone attending the reunion will get two-for-one drinks.

After that, they'll remove the cordon and you'll be able to get doubles for only a quid extra (woo).

I'm not a fan of Brannigans, but respect where it's due.  They bent over backwards to get us, and you can't really argue with that.

Oh, and as far as partners go - people can bring them if they're okay leaving them bored in a corner."

"event","Yip.  Southampton put Portsmouth in their rightful place ( i.e. outside of the competition ) and we've got more people responding.  Good stuff.

Fresh signups include :-
<ul>
<li>Sarah Burns</li>
<li>Emma Dunford ( the artist formerly known as 'Frecknall' ) - presumably this means Steve Dunford will be on his way down.</li>
<li>Nikki Russel - who reckons that Andrea is interested in the reunion</li>
<li>Sharna Webster</li>
</ul>

We've got some momentum going, but we'll need everyone who's coming to tell their friends.  There are some people that you just can't get over the email.

Oh, I've been told that the 'Tavern in the Town' may now be a 'Flares'.  See, this is the problem when you don't live in Southampton.

If anyone can confirm or deny this rumour, that'll be cool.  Once a final venue is decided, I'm probably going to ring them up anyways.  After all, if they've got 100 committed drinkers prepared to descend on their premises, they might be willing to put banners up and suchlike."

"event","After a rather lengthy trawl through FriendsReunited, I managed to invite everyone who registered themselves in the class of 1991.  Here's the first report on the initial responses.

Firstly, a big thanks to Matt James for sending on the contact information he collected.  Unfortunately, Matt is going to be in LA on the big day.  Ordinarily, it would indeed be Matt's hard luck ( I mean, how can you feel that sorry for someone who can't make it 'cos he can see the Pacific ).  However, in recognition of the work that Matt put in this year, we'll run a poll on the site where people can vote for the date that suits them.  The date with the most votes wins.  Can't say fairer than that.

<b>So far, here's a list of the email respondents.</b>

Eloise Channell
Matt Conner
Mat Francis
Clare Grayer
Matt James
Richard Ruddle
Sally Stone
Paymon Yau

<b>Over the telephone, we've got :-</b>
Dave Bartlett
Matt Clark
Martin Heather
Lee Renyard
Kevin Sim

Needless to say, all of these cheeky chappies will know some other people who'll be keen on attending - so although the numbers look initially small - it's been like 2-and-a-half-hours - what did you expect ;-).

Thanks to Matt again, I've also contacted Jeff Williams - who seemed quite keen on the last reunion.  If anyone would like to see any particular teachers at the pub, leave a message on the board.

Also, if you know anyone else who wants in to the reunion, let them know where this website is.  Updates will be happening as often as necessary,"

"event","As you may or may not know, quite a few people from Cantell's class of 1991
have been clamouring for some kind of reunion.  I'm not entirely sure why -
it tends to differ on a case-by-case basis.  Some people may be looking to
re-forge long-forgotten friendships.  Others might have a genuine interest
in the lives of those they studied with.  A fair few will undoubtedly
attempt to bore everyone else rigid with interminable photograph
presentations of the offspring they've managed to produce.  Still, rough
with the smooth, eh?

Sadly, most reunions don't get past the 'ooh - that'll be a nice idea'
stage.  Booking venues, contacting people and arranging dates all takes
time.  Furthermore, it's practically impossible to please all of the people
all of the time.

That in mind, I'm setting up a 'Quick and Dirty' reunion.  I'm not hiring a
venue, I'm not going to remind anyone who doesn't register an interest and
I'm not going to reschedule 'cos 'that kid from Maths with the acne' is
going on his yearly pilgrimage to Kings Lynn.

On Saturday February 28th 2004, just after tea-time, the class of 1991 are
going to descend on The Tavern In The Town.  It's at the top end of Above
Bar.  Internally, it's the same any generic 'McDonalds for adults' pub
chain.  It plays cheesey music pretty much constantly.  It's crap,
basically.  However, it's big enough to accommodate most of the year and
therefore, gets my vote.

I'm not interested in impassioned pleas about changing the venue or date.
The last attempts to set up a reunion have all been scuppered because
nothing was set.  You've got two-and-a-half months to clear your schedules
and where applicable, get your arse down to Southampton.

I'm going to set up some kind of website later to let people know who's
planning on attending.   If you're going to come, let me know and I can
plonk your name onto the site /AND/ give you the address.  That way, you'll
sort of know who to expect.

Cheers for now, and let me know if you're planning to attend.

Paul Taylor"

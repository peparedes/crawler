"event","well last weak was long and it made my feat hurt. today I went to coffin berry lake with danielle and her family member and katie...We ate swedish food and swam...If you stand in the direct middle of the lake it is shallow. so we hung out there, playing around and stealing the floatys from danielles brother and cousion, we had to shoot them with the water guns because they took katy hostage...lol.. then danilles 20 year old cousion asks if he can use a gun so I swim over and give him one and then like 5 minutes later he starts shooting me with it, so I had to shoot him back twice as hard...lol. So this thing was like a family reunion and it was strange because there were relatives from sweden and they talked funny. I wanted to try ludafisk..but there wasnt any..lol.
I am missing colorado bad because everything is difrent there. I am not treated like scum there, and my hard work is rewarded, and not unoticed..I am not the shit that mom treats me like.


well I am off

Well so the party satrted off kind of rocky and the minute Prentis got there hell started breaking loose, Galen collen and another friend of mine tory spent a whole 5 hours in a tent, and there was so much talk of orgys that it was frightening. Galen and colleen decided to go home because they were bored and anoyed then well tory went home and the really bad stuff started happening.  People started descusing shagging and how we needed alchool and so about at 2:oo am some one called John Price and he showed up with Wiskey and well lets just say the next day parents were complaining that Evangeline mary and my self smelt like alchool. My mother was then called and the Shit really did hit the fan and I ended up getting in a humongus fight with her where she took my brand new tv and I was locked in my room for a whole weekend. Yay real fun. well before I got grounded I went to the carnavel with Gabby Valedez and I won a daisy stuffed animal...hahaa...yaeh I love it well so.....I am leaving soon...call me before I go....

From there we all went to the KoA store to call marys parents and get soadas when who did we find works there...""mr.boobs"" aka Chris Miner, it was so funny he like booked it to the back room and puts on his coat so we cant see his boobs.Silly him dosent he know that we know he still have them. Hahaha so we left and went to Fred Myers to go buy stuff for my party...omg I have tons of pop and then we went to dary queen got a chicken strip basket and sharing it...that didnt work out with 4 of us. So then we brought Mary home and decided kind of spur of the moment to go to the Graveyard and spent another 2 hours hanging around there, where I died a total of 3 times and I decied that I get upset very easily...I also like to lay down next to graves..haha I know that I am strange. wel I am off...

Then we got back to meradiths house ate dinner and then watched the Rockey Horror Picture Show and the Replacements which we were talking half....okay most of the way through it. Then we went up to go get something and meradith brought down her nice Gina to sleep with us in her room. She ended up forgetting about me untill she woke up at 5 in the morning. Lol the wholle thing was funny. So that morning we went to the grave yard and spent about an hour there looking at each and every one of the graves, that was the best part. Then eventually we ended up bowling and then we invited Mers boyfriend to come hang out and as soon as he got there we had to go, I felt bad for them. So yeah good days always have to come to an end so I had to com home and it has been a snore feast all the time

I looked like I was in queen of the damned it was cool. We had a late night and hung around and talked and even fit time in to watch an hour of the in crowed. Finally we went to settle down about 1:30 or so, I guess I fell asleep and they began to talk to me and aperantly I talked back, Danielle even got a voice message of them  talking to. Then we woke up and hung out. I was suposed to go to a work day for the school play the twelf night but it got changed to a diffrent day, so I brought galen to a 4-h meeting. Big mistake he was so bored and I felt bad for him. there wasnt really anything for him to do and plus it was at the barn and it gets really cold there so we were freazing. Afterwards we went back to danielles aunt LeeAnns (our leader and practiclly my own aunt)house. There we hung out and snacked and she even game me candeles. YAY I LOVE CANDLES. She is so funny. She is about 7 months pregnant and I am so excited for her to have the baby and I love all of the lil clothes that she has gotten it.Oh I forgot to say the baby is ganna be a girl and they are nameing it madison.Well yah, i am so tierds

Its from the lyrics of a soung called Expo by u guessed it Last To Fall.

Pour my thoughts for her to see what it is that simmers deep inside of me. Powered from my rage, conqure these obsitcals to be set free from this cage. Breaking and buring my soul is learning to hate. Darker and darker at the entrance I wait. Patience is not a virtue of mine, for I tell her what is not on our side, time... Disbelife I have failed, one more time the ship has sailed...

"event","Nice, my dad just blew up on me. Man life is good. I just realized I am about as big as him. I'm just as tall, but not quite the weight yet. One day I'm gonna just snap on him. I hope I don't go too far. My anger will out do any of his tatical fighting skills. It will be a terrible day in my life and his. His fuse gets shorter and shorter as does mine. I mean just tonight, he was fucking his girlfriend in the shower as soon as we got home. How nice is that? I'm telling you, life is good. Fuck it, one more year of this shit, I don't care if I go homeless, but I'm getting out. I'll fucking go full time at Publix. I wish I could go to Iraq. It'd be so badass! Fuck this civilian shit. I could do great things over there. Jesus, well all n all today wasn't bad. Just when dad's around he always has something to get mad at me for. I hope one day when he comes home I'm like passed out from O.Ding on something. That way he'll have something to yell at me for. It's just little shit too, like I forgot to take this bag full of plastic bags to Publix so I could recycle them. I just forgot, I didn't throw them away or anything, but holy hell, he acted like I just got some chick pregnant. Before I fight him though I'm going to shave my head, I don't want his punk ass pulling my hair. He calls it a target of opprotunity. Haha, his handicap ass, all I gotta do is fucking wail on his neck a little bit and or on his shoulder and he's done. Fucker, loathing him is all I do lately. So much for true friends. This needs to be a remind to myself that parents can never be your best friends no matter what. Doesn't matter what they say, or preach, it just can't happen. This is my life, it's my time, do what I want."

Anywho, another thing is, I totally shut out any fat chicks or girls with a jelly bellies. Like I'll talk with them and hold a great conversation, but I so can't be with it. Like touch it or none of that. If I'm drunk enough I'll let a jelly belly go, but no more than that. Past couple of days have been balls fun. I make it fun, but if I don't, who will? I'm still loveing every second of heavy metal. I can't wait to get ahold of a girl again. She will be the most satisfied chick ever. Atleast for our age. Today I gave one of my female friends a foot and leg massage. She super liked it, and my skills are only going to improve. Muhaha! I'll just keep practicing on her so that way when the day comes and I really have to use it I'll be prepared. It's really weird, me, her, her guy friend, her cousin, and her guy friends best friend all went to the beach today. I was watching her interaction with this one guy, the one she likes, and it wasn't nearly as good as her's and I's. I think it's cause I was there, which I don't know why. I mean I could give two shits and a fuck what she does with a guy. I don't care if they started fucking right infront of me. I dunno, either that, or she doesn't want to come off slutty, but she's told me some stuff that they do... I don't know man, fuck it going out tonight with the boys! It's gonna be shweet! Hahahaha I hope Troy get's fucking SLOSHED! I'mma see if we can get some soda for me, that way I can be apart of the fun fun. Hahahahahaha, this is gonna be the shit! Fuck St. Pete and fuck majority of the people here. I hate it all. I say this with a smile, fuck off. Muhaha time to drink niggy!"

Stumbling into solitude. A clouded judgment day is fueled. Take me under your black wings. Mark my words and remember me. So sweetly she shucks away at my time. So sweetly she draws me nigh. Closer and closer towards never ending sleep. Spin the bottle. Kiss only the bottle. The dark mistress of many, beholden to none. Slips a ring of needles around your arm in an engagement. Eternal engagement. Never consummated. Take me under your black sings. Mark my words and remember me. Destroyer of senses. So take as needed for the pain.

If I was there till midnight I'd totally own my job, like no challange at all. Man good feelings all over! I got another talk from one of Haileys realitves today. It was her Uncle this time, it was a good talk and I think out of everyone that could give me that talk, he was the best suit to do so. Father dear hands, why have you forsaken me? In your heart forsaken me? Trust in my, self rightous suicide. I cry, when angels deserve to die. Deep shit? No not really, it's System Of A Down, can't really take them serious it's so bouncey and full of power! Muhaha, ah finally found my place and I like it.

I really miss Lakeland and all, but this is my life now, I need to adapt and take hold of whatever it is that is here. Anywho, she told me I was real close to being a close enough friend that she would die for me. Like that was supposed to make me feel special or something. What a dumb fucking thing to say. I mean, I guess she was trying to show me I mean alot to her, but that's just dumb. And I don't think she'd feel that way if I didn't look they way I did. So almost 17, then one year away then I'm 18. How badass will that be? To actually make it to 18. I don't even see myself at that age. Ha, hopefully it'll be a good year. I've noticed lately that I have become all the things I dislike in people. All the traits I don't want to have, I have. Awhile ago, I thought how badass it would be to be alone in life. It's not bad, but it is not where I want to be. Nice to be able to self analyze this stuff. One of my next phisical goals is to be able to do one armed pull ups. That's some hard shit right there, but I should be able to get if before summer is over. My dad finally got what he wanted. He wanted me to be at his maturity, so that way I can keep on advancing. I guess I should stop hidding it with all my childish actions. Oh well, life is now, and I'm living it how I want. Now I'll just live it better. Muhaha..."

Well I guess tomarrow isn't so bad now that I think about it. I'm sure I'll be in a total opposite state of mind then, but whatever. Heavy metal is awesome, like it makes me so wound up that I get calm. Like too many actions wanna come out at once that they just negate eachother. Whoop! Fighting is awesome. Hopefully if I'm gonna fight this kid it'll be this week. I hate waiting. It's gonna be fun caving his face in a couple inches. Man I can't stand him, and with all this anger I have towards my dad right now, who know's what the end result will be. Whoo, the air condidtioner is on, and is blowing right on my nipples. I've been reading alot about ancient mythology lately. It's so fun. I mean the stories about some of the gods' are hilarious. The ideas behind all the mythological creatures and supreme beings are just awesome. Man oh man, once again I'm reflecting on my life and I don't think I have any true friends. Well that just sucks. Ow well, I guess I don't have the place for them in my life. Hell if I know. Better days... I'm not even 17 yet and I'm fucking saying ""those were the days."" That's pretty pathetic. I can't figure out what I'mma change my name to once I move out. I'mma change the whole thing though. The only thing I'll still have from my past is my dog. Can't wait!

Not even damn people I guess, just people. Like my body wants to go out and do stuff, but my brain is beaten and torn. I think I've finally done it, just like gave up all my ""thoughts"" to people who really don't matter. I used to watch action moives where the hero always ended up alone at the end when I was a tiny little shit, and I always thought that was so badass. I didn't think I'd have to live that way though. It's not a terrible life I suppose. I'm still living, I'm in pretty good shape, girls like me, I have alot more stuff than some of the kids over in those poor countries. I dunno man, I think I just need to leave. I always planned eventually have someone and I never considered the thought that I just might be alone. That's all there is to it. Yea yea I know I'm young, but I can't picture any sane girl wanting to be with me for an extended period of time. The only thing I really have going for me is looks. And those aren't even that great, AND even if they were, they don't last forever. I think once I get into the Marines, I'll just kinda take what I need and ""run away"" over there. Just go M.I.A. I'll fucking tough shit out over there. Learn to live on my own and all that stuff. Eventually I'll come back, but I'll switch names and keep living a desolate life. Move out to Cali probably, just surf the rest of my years. I got no clue dude. You know what though? If I were out drinking or getting stoned right now, none of this shit would bother me in the least bit. Well now I got plenty of friends who are of age to buy me what I need to buzz my nights away. I don't even think it's cause I'm alone that I feel this way either, even when I'm laying next to a girl, my body is with her, but not my head. My thoughts are out there. I can't tell if I'm too advanced for my age, or if I'm just so far behind, or if I'm just a plain psycho for thinking the way I do. I got no clue dude."

The nude beach to be exact. There was only one person there, and yes it was an old guy. He laid face down in the sand, that means his penis was in the sand. Like an osterach burring it's head. I dunno, just like ""why was he there?"" Ya know? Anywho, we went to Sonny's to eat, decided we didn't want that kinda food so we went to Hooters. They had bigger proportions anyways. No pun intended. Then Shannon dropped me and Hailey off at my house. We just laid in bed, we can never be still, on of us is moving, so ended up wrestling. I totally owned her. Haha I know she's a girl and all but still. And now she's going around using my words. Like she tells people that she owned them. It's so funny.

I remember the first girl I truely hit on, I listend to one Godsmacks songs before I hit on her.

So I'm good to go. The other girl was the ONE girl who turned me down, so I got my ""revenge"" sorta speak. And the other, holy fuck she was super hot. I'm taking alot of heat for it though, but I could care less, she's a fucking liar, and I hope she regrets every thing that happend that night.

She said my name all night, and knew exactly who I was, and she's trying to say ""I thought you were someone else."" Like she had some blind fold on. She looked right into my eyes. I mean the person she said she thought I was, I look nothing like. She should be scared for life. Anywho, now this big polish fuck is wanting to fight me, glad to do it.

She always makes sure we have a warm meal. I don't remember much about my mom, but I do remember right before she died she made me promise I would never call anyone else mom. I used to hate my dad's girl friends when I was younger, I thought that they were trying to take her place. I dunno man, alot of baggage came from that whole thing.

Haha good thing I'm not. Holy fuck I love metal! I mean LOVE! Not like luv, but LOVE DAMN IT! It's the greatest thing in the world. Haha, it's neat how you're feelings for people change so quick. So I got alot of shit to do tomarrow. I wanna go to the Marines so damn bad! It's deffinatly where I belong. I hung out with Hailey almost the entire day. Haha, we were only supposed to hang out for like a few minutes, but she couldn't get in touch with anyone to go the beach, and then the weather didn't look so promising. But anywho, we watched all of Troy, which took FOREVER! Jebus that's a long moive. I'm supposed to watch it with mis mom, but I think I'm gonna pass. It's just too long to sit with someone. Me and Hailey it's different cause we made jokes and played around. But I took her for a ride today on my motorcycle! Whoop! Haha, had a hottie on the back of my bike. Haha, she's so badass. Glad I have her as a friend. She tried to tackle me, 'twas cute she ended up falling over and my dog pounced on her. Haha, he likes to wrestle, he's so human-like. Gawd dude, then this weekend is gonna be SHWEET! It's gonna be balls to the wall fun! We're getting a hotel at the beach, and were gonna invite a few ladies. We're gonna party but only like 3 of them are gonna stay in our room with us. Haha OMG it's gonna fucking rock. Hell, even if girls don't come, I'm just gonna drink until beer pours out my ears, or leaks out my eyes. Whichever happens first. It's gonna be great to hang out with Gary again. I dunno what to do though, like Hailey is comming, and I don't want her seeing me acting a fool with some other girl. I think I'll lay low, and if she messes around with another guy, I'll go grab a girl and do whatever. Haha, then Hailey is gonna try and stay with us. See if she can spend the night! But she sticks with me, I don't want Vik to try something dumb on her. She's gonna be like the first hot chick I just slept next to! Woo hoo! Haha what are friends for eh? Holy shit I'm stoked!!! And this Wendesday too boy.... Haha SUCESS!!!! This whole week shall be good. I hope dad let's me stay out there this whole weekend though. Anywho, I have to get sleep, there's so much to do with great rewards afterwards..."

It's depressing how shitty St. Pete people are. Whatever, dad made me work alot. He had me replace the blower in the boat. I did it all myself too damn it. He helped me with the wireing a little, but the project was mine. Then he and I blead the brakes on the bronco. I so fucked it up, it was great. I was all greesy and oily. I just picked something up off the flood and ate it without giving it a second thought... It didn't taste bad, but still... Anywho, then we went cruising around on our motorcycles. Dad told me that whatever I'm looking for, I'm not going to find it in the places I've been looking. I don't like when he's right, but like where else can I go? Or what else should I do? Or who else should I hang out with? Fuck it, I'll do my own thing. I only got 365 more days here, then I'm gone! Jason comes back like in a week from the Navy. I told him to bring me back some of those super short training shorts. But he said he'd only bring me a pair if I wore them ALL day at the B-B-Q he's having. I think I'mma shove a sock in there. It'd be a bad day if it was a windy day ya know? It's kinda sad I have more fun at work than what I do away from work. I mean the people there are fun to mess with. Constantly rocking out, I mean jesus. Especially us stock crew. When you get the right blend of people, it's one of the best things in the world. Everyone has their own place, it's badass. Gary got back into U.F! I'm so stoked for him. He loves it up there, that's like the only thing he ever looked forward to while he was here. I gotta get up there, do some MAD partying. It'd be pure KA KA KA CHAOS! You know what I should do? Stop investing emotions into these irrelevant girls. And money aswell. Like I should save all that shit up for a girl that's truely worth it. Simone wants me to come up there and visit her. I dunno dude, she's extremly hardcore, and I can definatly see having a life with her. But serious the kind of girl I really want to be with is like the chick off ""Clencher"" Chevelles lastest music video, or that one waitress at Cio Cio's. Oh my gawd dude, those girls are so fucking hot. No shit, I'd put life on hold for those girls. I don't think our personalites would match though. Haha so what, they're super hot. Someone told me I'd be a good american gladiator if that show was still on. That was the first time I ever received that complement before, haha people are neat. I think I'm going to start doing my home school. I really don't have much else to do. Might as well get smart while I'm bored. Fuck this shit! Haha, this tis the time to rise! I'mma do something with my life instead of fucking around with peices of shit. I have alot to say but talk is cheap. I'mma go get started!"

I'm just fuckin with ya, I can't afford harowin. Anywho, I went to the beach with mis mom and one of her good friends. It was pretty fun. It's nice to hang around with good people. But like we left kinda late, so I barely made it into work on time. It really doesn't matter but I definatly ran into work like white trash. I had a beater on, pants with holes in them, and super sun burnt. I saw AB baby, she's pretty badass. I haven't seen her in a long time. Work was awesome as usual. We make it fun there. We mosh whenever we get the chance, and we're constantly trying to do death metal screams and growls. Anywho, after all those hours of being in the sun, I'm super red. It's not painful yet. It's all over too, I mean like on my belly and everything. I was using it as an excuse to show off my mexicano 6 pack. I was like ""Look how sunburt I am!"" Then flexed a little. Haha that's so pathetic. Man, there's this ONE fucking girl, and I don't know what to do with her. Like it's so weird. So many damn mixed signals. Sometimes I think she has like two different personalities. It's super stressful sometimes. I was so looking forward to moving just to leave it all behind. I woulda been able to start all over again, but go figure when I really want to move I don't get to. Ah, you know what's kool? Like today, Kimmie and Morgan were all playing and shit, just like wrestling in the water, and everyone was like ""They're gonna get married one day."" Since they're so close and all, I mean I guess they've known eachother for years, and they are super comfortable around eachother. I mean I could see it happening, and both of them being super happy for the rest of their lifetime. I mean, I don't wanna sound selfish, but that just seems like a really kool thing to have. That kinda bond with someone. I've moved so much and burnt too many bridges... I'm telling you, I belong in the Marines. I think I'mma even change my name, so that way I can totally disappear. I don't know, alot of stuff could happen. Till then I'll just build up. Music is a weapon, I fucking love it..."

I asked for scrammbled, but ofcourse they were over easy with shell in them. So now my face is blue because someone broke into my house and tried to suffocate me with a colored condom. I wish I could make a sandwhich but I ran out of sand. My best friend Buddy the elf is like flipping out over this girl right, apparently she was kidnapped by this evil guy who owns a pet dragon. At first I was kinda sceptical about the whole thing, because ya know, this girl didn't look too good. I mean what would a dragon man want with an ugly girl. So we took up arms and went on a quest to find her. I had to make a stop at home depot to pick up my ax, and buddy got himself another hoe. So then we decieded she wasn't really worth it and ran over to publix, man that's one hell of a run. Holy shit I was tired. I shoulda got the small one handed ax, but no, I had to get those big ass Thor ax things. I kinda dragged it the last mile or so, but it made it super sharp. When we got to publix Buddy got all upset because he's a vegitarian and publix has a big meat department, so he and his hoe killed like the whole store. Whoever thought an elf with a hoe could do all that damage. The cops arrived about 2 days later and Buddy was pretty fucked up off nyquil, but we invited the cops in for some coffee and donuts. We all sat down and System of a Down took stage and started playing B.Y.O.B, what a great song. Man oh man those lady police sure get all crazy when good music is on, and donuts get flowing through their digestive system. Anywho I'm super whooped and Buddy took off with his hoe.

Ghey, see if I didn't like her we would be all kool and normal, no awkward silences. Oh well, man I did so much today at work, like everyone was happy to see me too. I kinda like it, it's nice to have people like ya. You know Hailey is all weird now, she's like ""What's up with you? You've been acting different."" I asked her to elaborate on that and she said she didn't know, I was just different. My dad thinks I should go out with her. Eh, she's super nice, and I really think she has a great future ahead of her and all that stuff, but I'm sure as hell not in it.

"event","Down time is all the time I seem to have nowa days. Like there's nothing ever going on, I'm constantly thinking of what can I do next and what I've done before. So on and so fourth. Tonight I went to the movies with Kristen, Jenna, Bonnie, and the funniest abnoctious person I know in real life, Seth. The movie didn't intrest me much, so once again, my mind wandered. My life is now, this is it, it's not a whole lot, but I'm alive, and healthy. Some people would kill to have that. I just want to get out of here. I mean my life is meant to be in the Marines. I was born to be one, not just any Marine either. I mean like the best fucking Marine ever. Kids will read about me in the future, that's the kind of Marine I'm going to be. This right now, it just sucks. So many people are caught up in a web of shit. I get tired of looking at it. I'm at this phase right now where if someone says something stupid, or something that I think I could help them with, I think, ""What good would it do if I told them?"" ""Would they even take my advice?"" ""I know in the end they will just do whatever it is anyway"" and ""Is it really worth my time?"". All those go through my head and then I just don't say anything. Example, relationships. So many people are in and out of relationships and they never know what to do, and this break up is far worse than all the other break ups they've had. Maybe I'm just one of those people who sits on the sidelines and watches everything happen and bitch about it. Perhaps I'm just another selfish person who has a bad attitude about something when I myself can't have what everyone else has, like in this instance, a relationship. Jebus, whatever happened to my good ol' Lakeland times? We went surfing, paintballing, beat the shit out of eachother, parited, crashed at eachothers houses. All that stuff, and now it's like that kind of stuff doesn't even exist. It doesn't help that my dad woun't let me get my liscence. It's deffinatly holding me back, and he constantly bitches about it. Like tonight would be a great night just to ride on my motorcycle. Just fucking cruise, hell go to Lakeland and back. Just sometimes when I get into this big deep thought thing, I feel like I can see what is going to happen, but there's nothing I can do about it. Ah, I need to surf. It's the ultimate mental floss..."

So apprently the chick that dissed me completly doesn't think I'm ugly. That alone was some of the best news. She thinks I'm cute, and it was just I was moving ""Too fast."" Haha, whoo! So happy. So who knows, maybe next time she'll let me kiss her. Man I had sushi today. It was good, but not filling, and I'm not hungary... So there's a new girl at work and I haven't even talked with her yet and Hailey is telling me to keep away from her. Haha, apparently she's her nemisis. Hell if I know. She was walking out with an older guy so even if I did try I'd prolly have no chance. I wouldn't mind kicking his ass though. Whoever he is. He's a big fella, it'd be fun. The lead singer of Breaking Benjamin look almost girly. Ow well, he sings descent. Sooner or Later is a good song. It's kinda hard to get into, but once you're into it, it's super good. I have more to say, but I don't want to.

"event","I got my first fuck up on my bike today! Haha, it burnt my leg on the exuast. It's about 4 inches long, and two wide. It's so awesome. Like I was making a sharp turn and I couldn't make it so I acedintly hit the gas and hit a tree and then the bike fell on me but my leg on the other side landed on top of the muffler so it was BURNED! I didn't even notice it for awhile. Dad says it's gonna hurt like a bitch and puss like a mother fucker but it's still badass. I'm a biker now. Muhaha! This is one out of many scars I will have from my bike. I love this shit! This is why you live, to crash and burn(literally in my case) and then get back up and do something new. Life is focking great. Too bad St. Pete sucks but as long as I got this kinda shit to keep me busy until I get to the Marine Corps, I should do fine. Gawd I've only had my bike for a week and I already put 50 miles on it. Haha, and crashed it. The mirrors were all fucked up. I make my dad proud. I got up to like 45 miles an hour. That's haulin ass in shore acres on a bike. Serious man, like one bananna peel and there goes brandon. I wouldn't die, but it would hurt like getting fucked in the ass by satans wife with a trident strap on... So hopefully if I play my cards right I'll have a girlfriend by the end of this week. I'm not 100% sure I want a girlfriend, but this girl is super kool so hopefully all works out. Ah haha why is life so good? Maybe I shouldn't question it.

"event","There's nothing that can take me off this high I'm feeling. It's weird, I get this when ever I'm surfing, or around good people, and I haven't been surfing in awhile. Today, I bought watermelon because it was on sale, and I figured it'd give my ateries a break. Man like an hour later, I pissed it all out and I was focking starving! Jebus, serious I really did piss it all out. I think next time I'll eat the rind. Might hold me over a little longer. It's ok, dads girlfriend brought some cake things over and I had some of them, and left over sushi... Man, I hope I was allowed to eat those cake things... Oh well, I work at Publix, I can get her a cake anytime she wants. So this guy is fallowing one of my friends around town trying to kick his ass just because my friend is dating this other guys ex-girlfriends. That fucker need to just move on. I hope I get to meet him face to face one day so I can ""explain"" to him in my friendly manner why he should stop being stupid. I miss fighting... It's probably one of the greatest rushes of all time. It's just so damn illegal. I mean it's like sex, the consequences aren't something you really wanna deal with. Ah, still feels good to give someone a beating of their life time. Good ol' days..."

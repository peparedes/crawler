Things you will need:</b></u>

Handful of mixed tomatoes
1/4 red bell pepper
pepper
Olive oil
Soy milk
Marinara sauce
baked tofu

Preheat the oven to 450F. Slice the tomatoes and the red peppers and put them on a cookie sheet (or if you're like me, a makeshift cookie sheet of foil. Add whatever seasonings you want. I went with lemon pepper. Put it in the oven for about twenty minutes, or until the tomatoes look kind of melty and sad. Let it cool to a decent temperature, and put it in the blender with a bit of olive oil, soy milk, and marinara sauce (how much you put in depends on how creamy you want the soup to be.) Blend. Slice up some baked tofu and mix it in. My blender does this nifty thing where it heats soups up as it blends, so there's nothing more to it. If your soup is cold and unpleasant, heat it up!

Man, this is the easiest soup ever, and it's totally tasty! Hope you enjoy.

(As a bonus, here is my kitty.)

Sorry, but the recipe for this is going to be rather vague. I wasn't really paying attention to what I was doing, as usual. I'm giving sort of random amounts of ingredients, because it all depends on how much stuff you want in your pocket!

<b>Ingredients:</b>

1 package fresh <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/77708184@N00/2292154169/"">pizza dough</a>
1 cup barbecue sauce
1/2 cup roasted corn
1 cup julienned carrots
1 package super firm tofu
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
<A href=""http://www.veganessentials.com/catalog/organic-olive-spray-oil-by-spectrum-naturals.htm"">olive oil</a> spray

1. Preheat the oven to 450F, and spray a cookie tray with a little bit of olive oil. Allow the pizza dough to rest for around twenty minutes.

2. Tear off a fist-sized amount of dough, and stretch with your hands, then roll out so that the dough is as round as you can get it.

3. Spread a spoonful of barbecue sauce on the dough, leaving the outsides (on a pizza, it would be the crust area) clear.

4. Put a little bit of each topping on one half of the dough.

5. Fold in half, and pinch the edges closed. For purely decorative reasons, you can press along the outside edges of the pocket with a fork.

6. Repeat until you run out of dough, or you have enough to satisfy yourself.

7. Stick it in the oven. Be careful to keep a close eye on them, because they go from lovely to burned in about two and a half seconds! I'm not sure about the exact cooking time, but I'd say to check it within ten to twelve minutes.

8. Om nom nom nom.



<b><u>Tips!!</b></u> Trader Joe's carries some fantastic products that really cut down on the preparation time for a lot of my recipes. They carry the pizza dough I use, as well as frozen roasted corn, and the firmest tofu I've ever found (that isn't already baked). You can also find pre-julienned carrots in most grocery stores. 

Make sure you don't go crazy on the fillings. If you put too much in, you won't be able to close the pocket, or, worse, it will explode out in the oven and you'll have a nasty mess instead of an adorable tofu pocket, and that's no good. :(

Feel free to put whatever you want inside. This isn't a list of MUST HAVE'S, it's just a basic guideline! Do whatever you think will taste good!

Marinating tofu overnight is a great way to add flavor. Although I didn't mention it in the recipe, I marinated my tofu in a mixture of smoked chipotle and balsamic vinegar.

We improvised a bit, and came out with delicious, low-fat lemon and raspberry cupcakes (with blackberries on top?)

To get our version, substitute 1 tbsp of canola oil for lemon oil, use raspberry applesauce instead of regular, and use lemon soy yogurt instead of plain. We also used apricot preserves for the topping, which was a little bit chunky and hard to use, so while it was pretty delicious, I would recommend using something else.

"event","HEYO, LONG TIME NO SEE!<br /><br />I have a deliciously perfect recipe for you tonight, called TAYLOR IS AWESOME, NOW SHOVE IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND BE HAPPY.<br /><br />Or, a&nbsp; filo pie.<br /><br />(Inspired by a zucchini and chickpea filo pie in the How to be a Domestic Goddess cookbook, and a GLORIOUS chickpea pie that I had at a Morrocan restaurant.)<br /><br />Things you will need:<br />3 tablespoons olive oil<br />1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar<br />1 small pumpkin<br />1 butternut squash<br />1/2 cup frozen corn<br />one package broccolini, trimmed<br />1/2 cup white basmati rice<br />2 1/2 cups vegetable broth<br />1 large can of chickpeas<br />1/2 cup melted vegan butter<br />7 oz filo pastry dough<br />cinnamon, to taste<br />garlic salt, to taste<br />8-inch springform pan<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""directions live here!"">Preheat oven to 400. Cube and peel your pumpkin and butternut squash, and toss them in a mixing bowl with your vinegar and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Arrange the squash and pumpkin mixture in a single layer on a cookie sheet, and cook for about 20 minutes, checking about every 5 minutes to toss the mixture. <br /><br />In a small saucepan, pan-fry the broccolini and frozen corn with garlic salt and a bit of butter until it is to your liking. Add the rice and 1/2 cup of vegetable stock. Continue adding the stock and stirring until the rice absorbs the liquid. Mix in the chickpeas and squash mixture, then add the cinnamon as you like. Set aside. <br /><br />Prepare the springform pan by brushing the bottom and sides with a little bit of melted butter. Use most of the filo to line the bottom and sides of the pan, brushing a bit of butter over each layer. Leave some filo sticking out over the sides of the pan. Add your filling, and then fold the top in. Cover the top with the bit of filo that you have left, pinching it as you go. Stick it in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until it looks delicious and golden and like something that you would want to cram in your face.<br /><br />If you're feeling particularly Morrocan, you can sprinkle the top of the pie with cinnamon sugar. Your call!<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/neurotic_vegan/pic/00004a2h/""><img width=""300"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/neurotic_vegan/pic/00004a2h/s320x240"" /></a><br /></div><br />I really need to take these pictures with something other than my phone, so you can see how delicious the food actually looks. <br /><br />MAN.<br /><br />In other news, expect more updates, because I've got to get ready for THANKSGIVING YAYAYAYAY."

"event","Hello, friends!<br /><br />Last night, I had one of my favorite things for dinner: fried <strike>carbohydrates</strike> <strike>weight gain</strike> <strike>heart attack</strike> rice. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Here is a picture.""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/neurotic_vegan/pic/00003sq5/""><img width=""300"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/neurotic_vegan/pic/00003sq5/s320x240"" /></a><br /></div><br />I have to say that my favorite thing about this is how easy it is to make. You will need:<br /> <br />1 package Uncle Ben's original long grain rice<br /><br />2/3 cup frozen vegetables of your choice<br /><br />1/2 cup&nbsp; Morningstar Farms meal starters (of the ground beef sort)<br />&nbsp;<br />1 tbsp&nbsp; fake butter<br /><br />1 tbsp vegetable oil<br /><br />tamari or soy sauce to taste<br /><br /><br />Here's what you need to do:<br /><br />Stick the rice in the microwave for however long it says on the package, and heat your oil up in a saucepan. When the oil is decently hot, add the vegetables and stir them around until they look less frozen, and then add the meal starters. <br /><br />Stir frequently, because the meal starters really like to stick to the bottom of the pan. <br /><br />When everything looks relatively cooked, add the rice and the butter and stir it all up, then, at the very last possible second, add your soy sauce/tamari until the rice is brown and everything tastes delicious. I also like to add fresh cracked pepper, but that's because I'm crazy.<br /><br />Err. Also, if you want to be extra fat, try adding those crunchy fried onions that come in a can. They're so deep fried that they no longer resemble onions, and can not possibly have any nutritional value. Delicious."

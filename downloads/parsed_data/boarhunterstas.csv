Today was good. I woke up and went to work for a few hours. Then to Arbor with my mom and gma. After I came home, Jack came over and we watched Snatch. I can't wait for Christmas. We looked in a pet store and she picked out a <b>Shit Zoo</b> to hold. She was so excited and thought it was the cutest thing ever. I can't wait to see the expression on her face when she gets the little guy. 

Speaking of Shit Zoos, I've heard that there is a new ugly one at the Schmitt house. Can't wait to see that either. 

I thought this time might have been different. But it wasn't. Always the same. And it's sad because I was really looking forward to it. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you'll come around after all.

Probably not.

Sara Bass=4 days.

Shit. Christmas=4 days.

I bought some shoes for $5.00 today."

I will be sad when Christmas comes around and I'll have to give this puppy away. Today I ""got"" the 24-hour stomach virus and didn't go to school. In reality, my computer got a virus and I spent the whole day reformatting it. I got to Lydia's house around 7 with Puppy. We went to Petsmart and saw a cockeyed cat. After that, we went to the best mexican restaurant ever. We took Puppy in and one of the mexicans thought he was a cat. I stopped by Caroline's house on my way home.

Then her mom took me to look at Caroline's room. She held my hand! =)

Actually, I was kinda nervous. Her mom scares the shit out of me.

I have a plan. And that plan is to spend a day with Caroline over the break.

The past two days have been <b>so great.</b> 

Except for the fact that my mom went to the hospital today. But I had a lot of fun with Kaci and Carter tonight. My mom had some crazy pains in her side. We thought it was appendicitis, but turns out she has some inflamed fat or something. She's staying over night in the hospital. She's in a lot of pain and I feel so bad for her. Carter came with me. What a bitch.  Then Kaci met us up there a little later. I <b>love</b> them. Then we went to the Mexican restaurant across from The Avenue. Poor Kaci. We left <strike>her</strike> Carter's number on the table. They called as we were walking out of the door. Stupid mexicans. Carter stole some way off brand mexican ketchup for me. As we were coming up my driveway, the Mexican's texted Carter...""Ey carnal."" I don't understand. But apparently they didn't either. 

Today started off great. I dominated my geometry test. And in third, she lectured about WWI, so I had time to finish all my work for 4th. Then in 4th I think I finally decided what I'm going to do my junior paper on. 

Yesterday was really good too. Right after school, Kaci and I went to see The Grudge. Seeing it a second time minus the black people was <i>much</i> better. I come home for about an hour, then my favorite Jessie is like, lunar eclipse party at my house...yeahhh. So I'm like hell yeah. So I drive over there. It was a perfect night. It wasn't warm or cold. It was just right. It was kinda foggy. And I had The Postal Service turned up...probably way to loud for my speakers, but oh well. Anyway, I watched the eclipse with Jessie, Caroline, Zack, and Ashley. And for anyone who doesn't know...birds actually have sex. There is no fertilizing through the eggs or whatever. Just ask Jessie, she is now a bird sex expert.

I hung out with Sarah D for the first time since 6th grade Wednesday afternoon. We went to The Avenue to find her soul mate. No luck. But we had a talk on top of the picnic tables. I love talking on top of the picnic tables. Actually, I love The Avenue. <strike>Its so scene.</strike> (totally just kidding <3kaci)"

It really really annoys me when people aren't reliable. And even more if something happens, and they don't call. I think about it and only have four people that I can fully rely on. Only four people I would trust my life with. I wish I could say I have more. Especially since 75% of that is family. But I can't complain, I have the absolute best family ever. And I've got some pretty damn good friends for the most part. 

International Club (woo!) met this morning. We voted for officers. And if Caroline Child gets Treasurer, then I'm her personal secretary. I freaking love Caroline. I saw her twin for the first time ever at the fair the other day.

Yesterday Kaci experienced me trying to parallel park. It works much better using cones instead of bar stools.

Today, Terri, my mom, and I went to Willis to try that whole parking thing again. Much more successful. Then we went to Longhorns to eat. Oh my. <h4>Oh My.</h4>

I <u>love</u> Terri. 
and Carter.

"event","So I just got home from the fair with my dearest Kaci. It has been a really long time since we have talked or hung out like we did tonight. It was <b>really</b> nice. We abused our armband things and rode a million rides. Or eight. Either one. On the way home I ""lost my wallet"" when in reality I came to the fair with a 20 and spent it all. So we went to McDonalds and gave them our sad story of losing my wallet. So they gave us two free cokes, two free fries, and two double cheese (which when she said ""give them double cheese,"" we were expecting McD's equivalent of a grilled cheese, but no, we got two double cheese hamburgers). All for free. Wee! So we make it home and what's the second thing I do? Get on line, read Sara's journal, check MyWaste, then update. And I found this group on Terri's mywaste: Pictures of <a href=http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=groups.groupProfile&groupID=100015893>Emo boys who kiss each other and who take pictures of it</a>. Hot guys kissing each other. It makes me sad. But then, even more, it makes me want to make out hardcore. 

Ahh I'm so <u>in love</u> with ""Choke Me"" by The Used right now. 

Today was pretty good. Lunch was great. Purkey, Cate, Nathan, and Michael were all there. Purkey and I asked the Yu-Gi-Oh kids if we could take pictures of them or if they would teach us how to play. One guy said if we took pictures of him, then we would be breaking his rights as an American citizen. Then Nick G. got pissed off at me for asking them. Poor guy. Fuck you if you pick on slow kids. I wish Downs on your child if you do that. 

<b>Oh My.</b> I just found a <a href=http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=groups.viewImage&ImageID=85694&groupID=100015893&groupName=Emo%20boys%20who%20kiss%20eachother%20and%20who%20take%20pictures%20of%20it&Mytoken=20040921193906>picture</a> of Bert and Quinn kissing.

Anyway, so about the fourth or fifth time I did it, it like, burned my finger or something. So now it feels like I have a burn on the tip of my finger.

I can't even explain the mood I'm in right now. The only thing that really sums it up is Underoath. All the way. 

The past few days have been crazy as hell. Terri's been with me from Wednesday to Sunday. Wednesday we went to Peachtree City, dominated some cheese fries, and hung out with Eryn, Meg, and Wes. First time I met Wes, even thought he was supposed to be at the first annual Surf N Turf. A reunion is much needed. Thursday was the big hoopla storm, so Terri and I stayed in that day. Except from 8-9 that night. We went out go get a newspaper and some food. Newnan has never looked so dead. The power went out. No street lights, <i>very</i> few cars, just black, windy, and rainy. So that was cool. We took a walk just after midnight. We called Davis, then hung out at his house for a few hours. Then Carter came by. Friday, the three of us went to Waffle House, then Terri and I were going to go to Fayette High to play Mommie and pick up Eryn in Terri's boat. Well traffic was bad, so we went to see Napolean Dynamite instead. That movie is great. We randomly ran into Andrew and Buck there. It was really nice to see Andrew. I haven't talked to him in such a long time. I've been really busy the past few weeks, so that's been part of the reason for not talking to too many people outside of school. The other reason is I haven't really taken the initiative to talk to too many people...if they don't talk to me first. And that can be taken as self absorbed or something like that. But it's not like that. I feel like with too many people, I was the only one making the effort to talk outside of school or whatnot. So for the most part, I stopped, until they were like...heeey. I guess to sum it up, I was tired of being the <i>only</i> one trying to communicate, so I needed that first little shove. And that's it. Ahh-screw trying to explain myself. So...the whole not talking to people until they talk to me deal. That left me with not talking to a lot of people that I now miss. And it sucks, but now it gives me some in sight as to how the friendship really is. Oh well. I've got two people that haven't let me down yet. And I'm just fine with them. Anyone extra is a nice nice plus. And appreciated. Anyway, so we saw Andrew and Buck. Second time I've been around Buck and wow, what a guy...

Saturday, Terri and I went to the Sharpsburg Festival. We walked around for about 10 minutes. The highlight of that whole day: 3 black kids and 3 white kids and one of their little sisters. The big white girl had a Dixie shirt on (I assume the blackies started it-since it would be stupid for the Dixie shirt to say something to the blackies) then this black kid starts talking shit about being racist because she had the Dixie shirt on. Then big white guh nagged them on. Oh wow, it was <b>great</b>. Right as we were leaving, I get a call from Gavin. He was stuck with his family, so we rescued him. We ran around Newnan and visited Matt McClelland(?) at Parable. Dropped the Master Gavin off. Then Terri and I went to Ruby Tuesdays with her sister Kelly, then we were supposed to go up where my dad lives to the AMC to watch a movie. Well, we get there, and they have this <font size=5><b>GAY</font></b> curfew law. So because we weren't 17 and Kelly wasn't 21, we couldn't see the movie. On our way home this nigger almost killed us. We get home, around 12:30. Sunday consisted of a bunch of TV. At 2 I went to the school for Photography. We went to these old old barns. They had horses and it made me happy. And that about wraps up my 4 day weekend.

Sunday. <b><font color=yellow>Yay!</b> Cartel and <strike>All Rights Reserved</strike> Taking Back Sunday. I am excited.

Speaking of Taking Back Sunday, I should be getting a TBS cd very soon.

Kaci just got here. She proposed. Tomorrow we have a date to go to the fair. 

Ok, I'll finish this later."

Saturday- I spent the day at the lake. We rented jet skis and now I am sore and paying for it.

Sunday- The highlight of Sunday was when Stepheo called me. And my mom approved Terri living with me for a day.

Today was nothing special. Terri is with me now and I am making fun of her because she just came back from the dentist and her mouth is numb. I'm afraid she might randomly start drooling everywhere. I love her. Thursday she is staying over here. That makes me say <font color=yellow><b>Woo!</font></b>.

Now I am getting ready to go over to Brittni's house to ""work on a project."" I love Brittni more than Asian people love rice."

Today was pretty good.
+Photography was extra boring. But we got our pictures printed.
+Second...wow, second is something else. Especially with Mrs. Wilson and her No Bad Words policy. I was talking to Jeffery and he's going to From First To Last, so it looks like I will be seeing From First To Last. <b>YAY!</b>
+Third, Kaci and I spent the whole block looking at cool people's, like Leah Whitehead, journals. <font color=red>I had a friend visit me in third.</font>
+Fourth was nothing special, but we found out the Homecoming nominees. Caroline Thrasher is a nominee. I'm happy for her and I'm <i>totally</i> voting for her. Paige is also nominated. <b>I love her!</b> She ate lunch with us today and it made me happy. I forgot who else was nominated. Maybe Patrick McClain will get it next year.
+After school I went with <b>Brittni Green</b> to CiCi's for some hxc pizza domination. Brandon Beat met us up there too. 

So Kaci (possibly) and me are going to Brittni's Monday night for a...project. YAYAY!! Haha, yeah...that project <strike>won't get worked on</strike> will be done one day ahead of time.

So I just realized today that in my entries from yesterday they both start with (or to some extent) ""Does anyone really realize how great Terri Harwell is?"" Well I'll say it a third time...

"event","Ok, Friday, school. Gay. Checked out to miss the <u>~*~</u>PeP RaLlEy<u>~*~</u>. Stepheo and Caro came by to pick me up. Chilled at Caro's house, went to the show. I got to see Kyle. Matt got me in for free. And saw the other billions of people there. Jess and I went to QT to pick up a Rooster Booster. I went with Stepheo to Taco Bell, Terri and Kelly met us there, but they were closed. So I went home with Terri. We went to Waffle House as soon as we got home. We get to Waffle House, and who is there? All Rights Reserved and TFOA minus John. After I ate I went over there to talk to them since I didn't have a chance to talk to them at the show. I want to see them when they come back in a few weeks with Cartel.


Wake up beside <font color=red>Terri</font> Saturday morning. Got up, got ready, got to Powers Crossroads to work at the Student Art Stand. <b>GAY</b>. So then a HUGE misunderstanding happened:

 <blockquote>I call my mom at 10, she can get to me in an hour and a half, which means she picks me up at 11:30, 30 minutes to get home-be home at 12. Paige picks me up at 12, talk so my mom for a few while I'm getting ready. <I>Everything</i> works out great. <br>
Only not at all...At 11:45 I <i>finally</i> get in touch with my mom and she is in freaking Marietta. Only 45 minutes away from where I am. So Paige comes to pick me up, only to stand in traffic. It took us an hour to get to Newnan when it should have only taken 20 minutes. Anyway...</blockquote>

So Paige and I make it to Atlanta at 2ish. We can hear Cartel coming from inside. So we run in, run to the front, and it was magical. I love little concerts. So their singer is rolling all in the crowd making love to his mic. He got over Paige and me, so we got to sing and it made me happy. I kissed his face? or something like it. Hahaha, but that doesn't compare to Kelly licking Adam Lazarra's face. Cartel's over. We met Caro C, John, Michael, Phil, Gavin, and Josh. The Working Title plays. Caro goes with me to see them. Their singer was fucked up on something serious. The Working Title makes me think of February-March. And I don't want to be reminded of that time. Working Title's off, Mae's next. Caroline and I stayed where we were because we were against the barricade and she is in love with Mae. They came on. Good, but boring. The A Small Victory was next. I've never really listened them too much before, but I liked them. Paige drives back home and we meet Gavin at Chin Chins. 


Sunday is Jessie's surprise bday party. Sooo many people were there. That whole night was amazing. Ms. Larissa -Jessie's mom- drive Jessie, Jenny, Caroline Burke and me. On the drive up to Wild Bills we blasted the TBS. Get there. <b>Wow</b>. Go home to TBS. Go swimming. Climbed on top of White Oak Elementary. <strike>Had</strike> Attempted races down the roof. Played on the playground. After that, about 9 or 10 of us piled on Jessie's parent's bed. There wasn't any room for Cate, Chase, or me. So we just grabbed a chair. Jenny was on another Mountain Dew high at this point. That's something interesting. Then we realize two people are missing, so we get a search party together and found them. Then we went to the football field hut or something. I had to pee, so I walked back home all by myself. That's when Toby kept me company. As I walk home, everyone kinda follows in behind me. Then Caroline runs up behind me. That's the first time that night she talks to Toby. She confesses her unpropounding lust for him. Hahaha, <b>CAROLINE</b> I LOVE YOUUUUUU! Everyone was either piled on the bed or watching a movie, so I just sat in the kitchen and looked at a Victoria Secret magazine while talking to him. Then around 5:30 or so, 20 of us made a bed in the living room. The other 10 were in the den. So Jessie had 30 people staying the night with her. Insane. 

So my mom picks me up from her house. I lost my flip-flops somewhere over there. I hope someone finds them, or its Converse for me for the next few days. =(    Then we go to Cumberland Mall with Rena, her brother, and their mom. Oh my god, not to be racist or anything, but every person that helped us was either black, asian, or a dot head. Jesus...I got sooo pissed off at everyone of them. Cumberland has become too ethnic for me. Fuck that. 



I love Terri more than you."

October 2=freedom. Almost. I am tired of depending on unreliable people. Especially for rides. I am tired of paying other people then we end up debating on change for gas. Then on top of that, they are reluctant to drive around when given cash <b>to drive</b>. October 2 means no more having to ask someone to take me to school 10 minutes early then have the response like it is so out of the way. I hate asking people for favors, especially when they sound so unwilling. Step up to the plate. Five miles is no big deal. Especially when you are getting paid for it. Jesus. 

So you want me to work on things. Ok. Now work on them yourself. It's a two way road. That applies to <b>everything</b>. You expect with out giving? I'm tired of that shit. And I'm done.

So I'm going on the Europe trip at the very end of May. My mom told me how they had Rock-A-Thons to raise money for when she went to Europe. Definition of a Rock-A-Thon: get paid for rocking in a rocking chair.

I hate at this very moment that I have no idea where my SoftLips is, and how I hate every guy I can think of with the exception of 2. And that goes for every girl I can think of too. With the exception of 2. 

And I hate even more that most of this comes from my own confusion or not getting what I want. What I've wanted for 3 years now. Which also comes from confusion.

I hate how you are so oblivious and can't see what is right in front of you. But its ok. I'm still here...for you to rub it in once again. 

I hate how you are so cynical and how you won't even listen to what people are saying. How you are in denial.

I hate how you are so self-serving and do things in the convenience of you. Not even regarding how others have gone out of their way for you. Can you even return it?

I hate how you have this image of how you want to be and don't even act on it. Do you care as much as you say you do?

I hate how you forgot about me. About that.

I hate how you are dependent on her.

I hate how I am <b>so</b> confused by you. By what you do. By how you treat me. I hate all of those countless conversations we've all had about you. Every day my opinion changes about you.

I hate that its you.

I hate how there is a smudge on my computer screen.

I hate your annoying sneezes.

I hate how I don't see you more often. 

I love how Toby just called me. 

I loved <strike>first block</strike> most of first block today.

I love Jono. He really is great.

I love Caroline. Even if she takes to long to look like a <font color=orange>carrot</font> to have a peeing contest with me.  

Now I have to call him and call him back. And I will love talking to them."

School was gay. But what do you expect. First is first. Second was nice. And so was third. Fourth wasn't that bad. So I guess my day was decent.

So I talked to Kaci in second about some stuff that's gotten to me. And althought I forgot how she worded it, basically it's like none of this gets to me. Except it does, maybe? Yeah...that didnt' come out right but whatever.

I came home. They were still working on the water heater thing. We found out why our laundry room smelled so bad for the longest time. There was a dead mouse under the dryer.

So after that, Sara was sad, so we went to the play ground. Gavin showed up later. That was awesome. Then Kaci came. Tried to find school supplies. Unsusccessful. Ah, fuck this night...but it was good.

I talked to Eryn for the first time Monday night. So around 4, Davis came over to pick me up. I went to Gap with him, then to work. I hung around Books-A-Million for a while. Then <b>Eryn</b> and <b>Meg</b> came. And that was the first time I met them in person. We drove <b>golf carts</b> (one person I know has one in Newnan-<b>Terri</b> around. I was excited about that alone. Then we pulled a Kaci and Stasia stunt and the Mexican restaurant. Then we went over to Meg's house. Eryn cut my hair. And it looks awesome. I've known the girl less that 48 hours, and I trust her with my hair. It's Marvelous. I met Justin, then we went to the Wyndom (?-fancy hotel across from the lake in PTC) and had a party. <b>JT and Garry</b> came. He taught me lesson one of Hardcore Dancing. =) Anyway, I could make this a super long post. But I had one of the best nights yet of this summer with them. And Friday I'm thinking Eryn, JT, Garry, and me are going out? Who knows. <br><br>Then today, my mom managed to find her way to me in Fayette. We went to the doctor's office, then to this driving thing in Douglasville. Then we came home and <b>Terri</b> came over. Jesus I love her.

"event","a big <font size=5>thank you </font> to everyone who read my long entry about warped. everyone gets a prize

I have one line of a song stuck in my head. Its been randomly popping in my head and I can't think of anymore of the song. Its killing me to death. I want to know what song it is. It goes like ""...I've got a..."" Yeah, great song, right? And the I've kinda echos. I would be so happy if anyone had any clue to what song that is. 

So the night of/morning after warped: Terri called the computer first and she stayed on it forever. Then she finally took a shower. Then Kelly got on it. During all of the night, <strike>Lydia</strike> Nasty Masty was mad and Kelly and me. I was sitting in her lap taking pictures with her, but then I laughed really hard all randomly and fell out of the chair. There I proceeded to draw a nigger crack head on Terri's ball. He had a bandanna on one eye, his other eye was blood shot, big pig nose that was pierced, and big bubble lips. His name was Don'tDoCrackOrYouWillGetLiceAndDie. Yeah, one of those long black names. While Kelly was on the computer, Terri and Lydia fell asleep. I was half way asleep, but mostly listening to Fight Club. So I told Kelly to come to bed so we could hardcore cuddle. We decided we couldn't sleep, so we went to the kitchen, I was going to make her a grilled cheese, but she got cheese dip instead. Kelly and I have planned that whoever finds a tapeworm-or whatever worm gets inside of you and eats your food-we will bite it in half and give it to the other person. Consuming a worm is our plan to skinny. So Kelly and I stayed up most of the night talking. Which is absolutely amazing. Around 6ish we walked to the observatory to watch the sunrise. Then we got tired. We were going to sleep up there, but it was wet and cold, so back to Terri's room we went. I sorta slept, then got up at 10 and wrote that super long ass entry about warped. 

Around 3:30 I came back home. Cleaned, made dinner, then off to the Thomas Crossroad's playground to met up with my Kaci and Sara <3. Then I spent the night at her house. What a night.

"event","After reading this I realized how long and pointless this entry may be so I don't blame you for not reading it. However, suck it up, read it anyway, and be happy for me. 

Warped was absolutely amazing. There were only 2 bands that I wanted to see and didn't: HIPV and MCS. Underoath played right before Hidden in Plain View. The barricade broke because the guy kicked it or people did that faggoshly gay swaying shit and landed on it or something. The point is, the barricade broke, Underoath got kicked out of Warped and Hidden in Plain View couldn't play because the stage was closed for the day. Which means From First to Last didn't play either. And it would have been nice to drop by them. 

So here is how the day went...Terri and Kelly had not had sleep for 33 hours. So you would think they would be tired, but they were not. They got to that stage where they just kinda staggered around and were really hyper in this wow kinda way. So they finally got to sleep. Lydia and Martha Ann and I are on the bed thats under Terri's bed. Yeah, not comfortable. We went to bed at 11:30 maybe? and I could not sleep. So at 1 or so-after lying there for over an hour and a half-Lydia's like, pstt stasia, can you sleep? And I'm like...nope. So we went to the kitchen. I made her a grilled cheese and it was beautiful. We decided it was too hot in Terri's room so we tried to sleep in the living room. Lydia got the couch, I got the recliner. Well, I can't sleep sitting up. So Lydia went back in Terri's room and I made an attempt to sleep in the rather cold living room on the rather small couch. Didn't get much sleep.

8:20 rolls around. My alarm goes off. I get up and take a shower. Then get Kelly and Martha Ann up to shower. Wow my feet stink. So we get ready and left here just after 10, went by my house, hit it up McDonalds style, and to Hi Fi Buys we went. We get there just before 12. And there is this extremely long ass line of people. Maybe like, a fourth of a mile? Anyway, doesn't matter. So it was cool though because we basically walked during the whole line so it lasted all of 5 minutes or so. Off to the pee room.

Once we leave there and get closer to the main stages I hear ""Above Me"" by Rufio. I was like, hey...I'm not missing Rufio. So I pretty much ditched Terri, Kelly, and Martha Ann and ran to Rufio with Lydia. So we made it there during their second song I think. So I was very happy I got to see them. So Martha Ann, Terri, and Kelly went to the stage beside Rufio to see Allister. I lost Lydia somewhere between Rufio and Allister. So I watched some of Allister while looking for everyone. Then I ran into Amanda Mcallister (?). And I was like...hey and she was like...whats up. So during our small talk, I caught a glimpse of DJ out of the corner of my eye. So I ran over there. He was with Allen, Cody, and Josh. Wow. This is turning out to be a rather long entry filled with bunches of details. 

Next band we went to see was From Autumn To Ashes. We got there about 10 mintues early because we decided to kill during FATA. So we walk to the auditorium and see Gina, Paige, Mercedes and some other people. So Kelly, Gina, Lydia, Terri and I made our way to the stage. FATA comes on and it was amazing. Except for the faggoshly gay swaying. But I guess that just happens. We stayed together for the most part but this pit got going and there were Miles and Danny. Terri had to get out of the crowd, so she crowd surfed for her first time out. I think Lydia got out too. So it was just Gina and me-Kelly was at the pit until...Danny died. Died in such a way that his legs said fuck you and didn't work anymore and he eventually passed out. So Lydia and Kelly and Miles go over to First Aid. After Terri got out I decided I wanted to surf too. So I got up and out then met back up with Terri. Then her favorite song came on, and I wasn't going to miss anymore of FATA, so we got back in. Except this time it was kinda hard. People were standing in the seats, so I had to stand on the arm rests and I was afraid I was going to fall. But I made it up to the front row of seats and I was like hey to this guy, then I told him to get me up. So he tried to warn the other people infront of him, but he was not successful. So I just kinda landed on a bunch of people who probably weren't expecting it since they were in the back of the pits and stuff. So I got up, got to the front, and got down just before the bouncers. I look to my left and there is Brittany Roberts with PJ and Jim. Ok, yeah, so stayed there for the rest of the show. <333. Met back up with Terri and we went over to see Danny. Ignoring the fact that Motion City Soundtrack was playing right beside FATA.

So Danny didn't come out so I decided to walk around. I think this was when I hooked up with EmoAlan for the first time? Maybe, anyway, so the next band wasn't playing for another hour, so I'm pretty sure I just aimlessly walked around. Billy Talent was next. Holy shit. I was standing there talking to PJ about how he was going to see Billy Talent with me since no one else was with me. Then I hear someone calling my name. Its Jeffery and Jeremy. About that time, PJ pulled a fuck you Stasia and went over to Anti-Flag's last song because they were going to have a circle pit and PJ wanted in. So Billy Talent was setting up. I make my way up to the front and ran into Kelly and Lydia and Lydia (Martha Ann was lost from Allister until about 4ish). Then I saw PJ and Jim in the pit. Very <3. So Billy Talent kicked my ass and I loved it. 

I'm thinking the next band I saw was Coheed & Cambria. I found Alan and we watched that together. Coheed's crowd was a bitch. Like, all of these snobby fatasses wouldn't let me by. Then some guy thought it would be cool to grope my ass. Only it wsan't. I was thinking about tellint Alan to punch him, but then some girl surfed over our head so I saw that as a chance to run through these people. So we managed to make our way kinda up front. Coheed put on a good show. 

As Coheed finished, Hidden in Plain View was supposed to start. Alan and I started to walk to this stage that looked like it would be for one of these local bands with a nice small crowd. Well Alan lost me on the way there, so I'm walking up to this small stage with 2 groups of people. And I'm like...not what I expected for Spencer. Then I see these people with brooms sweeping. And I'm like, that's retarded. Then I was like...hey, HIPV isn't playing. So as I got closer, I saw Zach Beahan <3333 talking to Spencer. So I went over there and Spencer was like...Underoath killed the barricade so they are shutting the stage down and we're not playing. So that sucked a lot. Then I went over to Paige and Mercedes and talked to them. Then I got bored and walked back.

I found Alan again. I heard Hit or Miss and I'm like, hey, let's go check out New Found Glory. Once we got there, Alan was like...gay. So I was like, alright, I'm getting closer. So I got some guys to get me up. I made it all of 2 feet and I was dropped. It so awesome getting dropped when your crowd surfing. Last year during The Ataris, I got up for the first time. Well, they dropped me. Bastards. I remember in that split second a million thoughts ran through my head. It seemed like it took me a minute to fall. Then my spine felt this dull thud and a million people rushed to help me up. So when I fell during NFG, I was so hot and out of it, it was actually nice to fall. I don't know. I'm stupid. I think its awesome in this amusing way how if you (and by you, I mean me) act like your over heated, 9 out of 10 times this guy will be like, are you ok? and get you back by a pit where you can get some air. And I also love how when you fall, a billion people rush to pick you up and make sure you're ok. Anyway, I got up closer than I expected to NFG and it was an awesome show. 

After that, PJ called me and told me to meet him by this tree. So I get over there and Alan, Kelly, Lydia, Terri, PJ, Jim, Emilio, DJ, Martha Ann (was finally found) and some other people were there by the tree. So I hung out there for a while. Then I went out to find find a shirt to pass the time until Yellowcard. It was a toss between Billy Talent and FATA, I decided Billy Talent since the band was there. Then I went to see Yellowcard. It was a disappointment compared to last time. Right after their first song one of their amps blew. So it wasn't the best, but it was still cool to see them. 

Jesus this is a long one.

Taking Back Sunday played at 8. While we were standing there waiting for them to finish setting up, the most ridiculous but stupidly cool thing happened. The whole crowd started throwing bottles and blown up condoms. So you would be standing there thinking you were ok since non of the bottles were coming your way, then you would get pegged in the back of the head. Anyway, so before TBS came on stage, we were toward the back. As soon as they came on, Kelly just charged to the front with me behind her. It reminded me of Danny and Miles on Valentine's Day, except not as violent. So Kelly got right in front of Adam. I was tired of having these fatties attempting to crowd surf to the front only to have people drop them, so I moved over to the left of the stage in front of Fred. It was there I saw <3Carter. Kelly got a pick. And I think she almost died when Adam gave her a heart with his hand on stage. 

So after they were off, Carter and I tried to find something to drink. This guy gave us 2 Powerades for 4 dollars. This was wonderful considering they were selling them for 3:50 each. So I called PJ to see where he was. He was at the HIPV tent, so Carter and I walked over there. I was turning around to talk to Carter-not looking in front of me, and I grabbed this guy's ass by mistake. =(  So I found PJ. And I found Nate. I talked to him about the 21st. He said he could do it if it was about 5 days later. I really want Giving Up Goodbye to play. I also found out on the way home that Fall Out Boy is playing on the 21st. So even though I probably won't bring it up to my mom, I'm thinking about doing it the next Saturday? I don't know. I ran into Paige on the way to see PJ and met one of the Lakeside kids. Perhaps they might play? Yeah...idk. 

Kelly got a TBS shirt that has 3 sheep on it. The third sheep is bleeding from the knife that is lodged in its back. Underneath the sheep says ""To Hell With All Your Friends."" So I took the infamous blue sharpie for the day and wrote Stasia on the stabbed sheep. Kelly is the first one. And I made a crossword out of Terri and Lydia. But since Lydia is no lamb, she can be no sheep.

I wonder how many people's sweat got on my that day. Kelly and Lydia have yet to shower. Dirty hoes. JK to the max. I fucking love those two with everything and then some. Terri too. <3


Ok, this is quite long enough, I'll update about Kelly's and my morning later."

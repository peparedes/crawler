Apart from that and randomly saying hi dorkishly to people i did hardly anything...Oh i just remembered how cool my art teacher is, we started off by talking about how to shade in wood and ended up trying to think of every subject with the word wood in it..OMG i can't belive i didnt think of Elijah. how silly. :S"

"event","Today my fellow student Ruth told me about her dream. Here goes ( i apologise for the randomness and before you start asking...Stantion is a small town where Ruth lives):
Ruth, our friend Gemma and I were being held hostage in her bedroom while nazis took over stantion... For some strange reason the window was open so we climbed out and jumped her back wall which leads into a graveyard(it does in reality people!)and Gemma randomly ran away escape the semi mortal doom of the nazis. Ruth and I however were not so lucky after catching sight of us they followed- shot me dead and captured ruth. I was quite annoyed to find that Ruth then prayed for GEMMA and not her long lost dead companion ME. but anyway, that was the higlight of our conversations today. hope you enjoyed!"

"event","Ohhh had a blast today! One Big sunday provides many opportunities to get hit stamped or puked on. For example, i myself was hit by a floating inflatable chair followed by a carefully aimed loo roll. I couldnt moan for long however, as electric 6 made their appearance and sang the oh so joyful songs, gay bar and high voltage."

And so after a tormenting 3 3/4 hours of tests i trudged back home to find chips, yes chips! Not burnt ones but loveable happy chips which go well with salad cream, and so after eating them i no longer am in a bad mood...

"event","Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Here's a little number I tossed off recently in the Caribbean. [Sings]

     Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis,

     Isn't it frightfully good to have a dong?

     It's swell to have a stiffy,

     It's divine to own a dick,

     From the tiniest little tadger,

     To the world's biggest prick.



     So three cheers for your Willy or John Thomas,

     Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake,

     Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend,

     Your Percy or your cock,

     You can wrap it up in ribbons,

     You can slip it in your sock,

     But don't take it out in public,

     Or they will stick you in the dock,

     And you won't come back."

"event","just a little cheer-me-up song to brighten the day!

The Nazgul walk up to Theodred and look around the empty horse parking lot behind him. 

Theodred: Welcome to the R.O.H.A.N dealership! 

Nazgul 17: The what? 

Theodred: You know the R.O.H.A.N. Music! Lights! 

The lights go off (even the sun), a disco ball appears out of nowhere, everyone is suddenly wearing ugly seventies clothes. The Y.M.C.A music starts playing in the background and Theodred starts singing: 

Ride it!
If you don't have the dough
I said ride it
Then you know where to go
There's a place here called R.O.H.A.N
You-can-get-a-horse-now
Just ride to the R.O.H.A.N
Come to the R.O.H.A.N
You can get your own horse
Or maybe a cow
When you first ride
You're sure to go WOW!
Just ride to the R.O.H.A.N
Come to the R.O.H.A.N
Ride a new cow
Or maybe a horse
Any other dealerships
Are so much worse
So come to the R.O.H.A.N
Just go to the R.O.H.A.N


Nazgul 13: Okay, okay, we get the point! 

Disco music stops and lights come back on. 

Theodred: Sorry.

But anyway, my first entry in live journal (must remember to spell that correctly)if you follow this carefully you will get an exclusive insight to my life, i bet you all would love to see that!...*dust balls fly past scene* or not.
Who cares! Basically i will explain a few things:
-I have two alter egos named Lurtz 2 and girly Frodo (you'll hear more about them later)
-I hate rude people and i heart geeks.
-I have two bestest friends in the whole world 9and around the world too may i add) laura from Belguim and Charlotte from near me.
-I like to say great alot

So there you have it, comment, and read up on 'THE LIFE OF CARIS!'"

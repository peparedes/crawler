"event","Holy shit, it's been a hella long time since i've posted something on this peice. A lot of changes in my life....some good, some not so good. I moved to the beach with my momma dukes, and moving again to an even nicer place. I can't wait, my room is in the poolhouse!!! How fuckin tight is that?! I have my own bathroom and kitchen....most importantly my own fucking space! It's nice to finally get something you want. Prom is coming! WOOO...hopefully ashley will be single, that way i can have a good time. Speaking of which, her boyfriend David is like a fucking virus that i can't get rid of!!! AHH, it drives me nuts. If I could change one aspect of my life right now it would be to get rid of him and get my ashley back! Not only has he taken my comfort with ashley, he's given me the akwardness that deturs me away from all the friends i used to chill with. It's because of him so much has changed. so for david i say .... ""FUCK YOU!"" That was some decent venting right? 

My mom wants me to quit smoking weed for the rest of the school year!!! Thats insane! Thats like asking an alcoholic to stop drinking....right now! It'll be the second hardest thing i've ever done...that is if I do it. 

Ok, so maybe it wont be so long till the next time i post something on this. 
Words of wisdom: Go after what you want if you know it can make you happier, and dont stop till you get it. Destroy all obstacles between you and your love.

"event","When most people go from having a great day to a shitty day and back and forth, they complain and hate. I seem to love it. When i go up, it's the best feeling in the world. And when i go down, i don't really get down, i just anticipate coming back up. I love the rollercoaster of day to day life! So let me express Beth to myself, and the 1 or 2 people who have ever read this. She is so amazing! That smile of her is like a truck to the knees. It just melts me. It's the first time i've had butterflys from a girl in such a long time! It feels good. Even when i just think about her. I had a candle light dinner on the beach with 2 dozen roses all over the place.....all for her. It's just the beginning tho. We shared an amazing kiss on the beach under the stars with the sound of the waves relaxing us. She so great to talk to, i couldn't tell which was better, the kiss or just laying there and talking under the stars. And to stare into her eyes and her smiling back at me is like a dream. I'm scared....but oh so happy at the same time. Only time can tell how the future smiles come about.

"event","This weekend has been the most life changing weekend of my life. I feel like i can't look at anything the same again. I've had a part of me ripped away and another that walked away to another place. I feel as if i've died and come back to life. Am i in the wrong for feeling the way i feel. I can't even describe it so how can i be wrong. Let's some this weekend up: I was stabbed in the back by the one companion i thought i'd have through my entire life as a true best friend. It's amazing how one person can impact your life so much. I always wrote about this girl in my school papers about the impact she's made. And i didn't really notice the true magnitude of her influence untill tonight. Ashley.....i know ur going to read this, you probably will never understand this change of events in your life or why it happened, but it did. I knew we had grown different as people, but you have changed so much differently than i had expected. oh well, know i'll move on....to a whole other place. I know i'll figure it out, but this one is gonna be an adventure. Good ridance to the old times....peace.

"event","That show was banging....!!!! WOOOOO!!!!

Shinedown did simple man and it was so amazing, it gave me chills. He can sing his ass off. New idol. And ofcourse the slipknot. No one puts on a show like slipknot. It's been decided. 

It sucks for someone who's never saw them before but had to leave early cause they weren't feeling good after they paid for pit tickets. Oh well. It was great. Much love to music.

Peace

I can't believe i'm saying this, but i can't wait for school. It's gonna be a great year. I'll be damned if it won't be the best year i've spent in school so far.

BOREDOM! Fuck it, i'm gonna find something to do......peace bitches!

"event","Gotta love the beach. Shit is nice. I got some sun, chilled with ashley. I saw Kristen hewit there...and DAMN! She got hella hot. So i talked to her for a while reminising(sp?). That was fun...the good times. Ashley my apologies...for my lack of trust, but i get to that thinking to much stage a lot. 

My friend died in a car accident. Brent Perry. Kool ass dude. Lets bow our heads for a min for him.

.....

...

I'm sure he'll appreciate that. His memorial service was so sad, i admit...i shed some tears with pierette when she came up to me. I've been chillin with chris ridick a lot in the past few days...funny bitch. Well that was good. PEACE BITCHES!!!!

"event","BLAH! fuck the weather. I wish this hurricane would get here, i love a good storm. Not to sound cocky in the least little bit, but why is it that there are so many girls out there that i could easily hook up with and are interested, but the one girl i want doesn't want me. It pisses me off. FLUSTERED!!! MYAH! so i'm chillin in my room and ashley's sleepin on my bed behind me...(she sleeps a lot). Around me atleast. Am i boring, or does just so happen that she's tired everytime i'm there. I do like the fact she confides in me and finds such a comfortable place around me. 

My grandfather comes home tomorrow. I'm scared and excited at the same time. I'm scared that he's gonna come back and just fuck up again, but i'm excited that he could come back and be the right way again and everything will be perfect like it was in the olden days. Keep your fingers cross. 

Why is that the things you don't want to happen happen so easily and things you want to happen, you have to try so hard to make work and wish for luck. Fuck it, i'm just gonna let things happen and not try so hard...who am i kinding, no i'm not i can't do that. It's not me. 

I think i lost my job, which does suck. But i'm starting my bussiness and gino's can kiss my ass. HA. TOO MUCH PIZZA. I'm out, peace nuckas!

"event","I've been a bit stressed out lately. My fucking car is a POS! and it sucks. Trying so hard not to lose my job. BUt if my car doesn't quit being a jackass it may end up like that. I'm not usually the person to get stressed out, but with the car and my bills, and the army decision, it's been a bitch. Oh well. It'll wear off soon. When my grandfather gets home everything will be good again, like it was back in the olden days like 8th grade. No money worries, and everything will work again. He's a good man, just made some bad decisions. 

On another note...

We all get these moments where we feel that are existence is unnessesary and we feel unwanted. Well yesterday i felt some of that. I can't really say why, but i did. Today i just sorta blew that feeling off. Akuna Matata, right. Alls well that ends well. Live the life to the fullest. On that, i'd like to say, keep your head high and the glass half full. Peace.

"event","The sun was out today....with a great breeze. I went to the beach with that ashley chick and chilled. It was tight. 

Does anyone ever have those brief moments of confusion that take over all thinking processes for a short period of time? I've had a shit load of those lately. But hopefully the confusion will become satisfaction with time. The question is how much time can i handle. I want that missing piece to fully fit back in my puzzle. It's there, it's just not placed right.

Anyway, time for bed. Maybe i'll get to sleep before 2 tonight....nahhh. Peace.

"event","yeah....after 2 days of just about non stop singing, my throat is ready to jump clear out of my neck. I sang/screamed from 9:30 last night to about 1am then did some acoustic shit with kyle at my house till about 4. Woke up this morning and went to my vocal lesson then went and jammed with semblance. The memories....good times. Hopefully they're gonna want me back in the band. I enjoy the music a lot better than suckerpunch, but both bands are very talented. Now i sit here with this awesome chik....assley! WOOOO. Peace nuckas!

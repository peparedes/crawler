"event","There are about ten countries on this planet with nuclear warfare capabilities: United States, China, Pakistan, India, North Korea, Great Britain, Israel, France, Russia, and Germany. 

United States, Great Britain, and Israel are a triumvirate. Willing to fight for eachother in an instant.

China and North Korea have an obscure yet tight-knit underground alliance. 

France and Germany have been enemies since the dawn of their creation. Yet as of lately, their hatred has been dissolved. They are now edgy yet close allies.

India and Pakistan despise each other. 

Russia is solo on this one...

Ultimately, The United States will always have quarrel with Non-Democratic nations. China being the biggest threat to America, will be their number one enemy by default. 

Eventually, China will initiate some type of agreement with North Korea that will create an open alliance. Which in turn, will give North Korea the confidence to continue their nuclear arms program. This will then aggravate The United States and put them under pressure. The United States will continue to send diplomats as well as increase espionage in North Korea. If the United States continues to have a Warmonger president like Bush, then more severe actions will be taken.

The United States will declare an ultimatum to North Korea, which will ultimately state for North Korea to disengage from all nuclear development. If North Korea refuses, The United States will embark into another great crusade to oust a foreign government with military force. Inevitably, North Korea will decline the ultimatum.

The United States will be in shock of North Korea's sudden refusal. A second ultimatum would be declared to North Korea. Yet again, they will decline. The United States would have no other choice but to begin the invasion.

The Wings of Death will begin to spread. Shrouding the Earth in shadows and dust..."

For all of your amusement, I bombarded Still Life Projector's Myspace with hate comments. Read and laugh at these 720 dumb fucks:

Chris:
you guys are the worst fucking band on earth. you and your 720 bands are worthless. please kill yourselves imediately. kthx. 
 
Still Life:
sorry you feel that way. Glad we are making a big enough noise to have you go thru all the trouble to email us and tell us. you must have your own band and are struggling and sucking dick just to get a backyard party gig.
 
Chris:
actually... i do not do the band thing. ultimately your music is horrible with all your scenester fuck friends. do elitists a favor and kill yourselves 
 
Still Life:
so you dont have a band and just suck dick for beer money or is it enjoyment ? Listen Screech i can find you and then you can tell me to my face and we will see what happens. i know a lot of people on your list 
 
Chris:
i find it cute how you have to bring other people into this. it would be my pleasure to sever off your head in public. *muah* 
 
Still Life:
bring it Screech 
 
Still Life:
you know what you are not even worth it. it is people like you that bring Sacto drama and it is not called for. Why do you hate us so much ? Did i fuck a chick you liked or spit on you or something ? 
 
Chris:
no. i heard you guys play a while ago and I wanted to shoot myself in the face. your music is so cliche and repulsive. especially your fan base. how can you guys live with yourselves? also about the ""fucking"" part, it is not my problem that you fuck underage girls. is that the best you can do, you piece of shit? if you want to escalate this shit, be my guest. i would gladly beat the living shit out of you. also, if you plan on bringing people into this, be aware my ""friends"" outnumber and surpass your piece of shit 720 friends in every aspect. in other words, do not be a pussy and fight your own fights. that is all i have to say.

Still Life:
first off I dont need a bunch of friends to handle any my fights especially with you. you actually have me laughing with your anger towards our music and especially our fan base. Everyone has their own taste in music and if you dont like ours that is fine. You are the one who came and took the time to insult us. Why because we have a fanbase and play music that people like ? Get off your holier than thou kick and just relax. Go on with your life and do your thing and stay here in Sacto and cause your drama with other people. I am over it 

Chris:
my point exactly. you guys are worthless pieces of shit. look around morons, your fan base consists of scene kids with fingers up their asses wearing 720 shirts. i would love to have kids like that love my band. you cunt. so go die now ; )

That had to be the most fun I have had in ages. Take care everyone ; ) Down with 720 kids/bands/whores/label."

Bodies lay stretched for miles across the barren planes.
The weary Germans hold their rifles with one last grasp. 
With Battle hardened yet hopeless faces.
They hold their heads up with pride and valor.

Death smiles from across the horizon...

The Red Army is closing in upon us.
The alarm is sounding, explosions are in the winter skies.
I hear the screaming bullets piercing the air on both fronts.
The tremendous vibrations of mortars eroding the earth.
The sound of flesh being battered and deformed.

The stench of death engulfing my senses...

Blood splashes upon my face.
My brethren are falling before me.
Oh no! This is it!
I hold my rifle sight to my eye and I begin to fire.
My merciless bullets exploding with fury and determination.

I shall not falter...
I shall not drown in the sands of death...
I shall persevere and fight with honor...

I am a German Soldier...

I feel as if my old friends have been extremely hypocritical towards me and conjure up the past against me. I figure this is why I am so critical towards society and who I associate myself with. I also despise how old friends I do not like at all, associate themselves with friends I love. It discourages me to hang out with them anymore. It is inevitable.

"event","My very persona is on the verge of annihilation.
The spirit within my being is beginning to collapse.
The pride that I possess is on the edge of extinction.
My morals have descended into the depths of hell.

Is there hope for a mortal like myself?
Is there hope for a being that has hurt so many on this Earth?

I have walked this crimson path for a time well spent.
I have breathed in the cold autumn air with all my energy.

Yet in the end, all I feel is emptiness.
All I feel is sorrow and mourning.

Will I be able to redeem myself and walk along the path of light?

The air is crashing down on my soul.
I am beginning to falter from within.
My eyes feel heavy, my heart begins to slow down.
I feel extreme pressure throughout my body.

The blood stains on my shirt,
are from the hearts I have ripped out.
The concentration of calcium,
is from the many tears that have flowed down my shoulder.

I ascend into the heavens above.
I look down upon the bitter Earth I love yet despise.
I give it one last look, one last smile.
I whisper...

My last goodbyes..."

"event","Friday, I went to see Poison The Well at the Boardwalk. Aubree and I went a few hours early to get tickets in advance since we did not want to take the risk of tickets being sold out. We saw Danielle and Nadia just leave right when we got there. After that, Aubs and I went back to my house to do our hair and get all sexy and what not. I took a quick shower and started picking out clothes for Aubree to wear. After, I put a shit load of wax in her hair and made it look hella cool in the back. Then I promptly did mine. Finally we left and began our trip to the Boardwalk. When we got there, there was a huge line to get in. So Aubree and I got in line and what not. I saw an old friend from Vacaville and went up to him to see how he was doing. I always fucking forget his name. It was good to see an old face. Then I went back in line and finally we were coming close. Joel was there with some people and they would have had to go all the way in the back of the line. So I showed some sympathy and let them get in front of me. Afterwards, we finally entered and there was a shitload of people. To my surprise, there were more bros and like ""rockers"" than 720 kids and fashioncore kids. It was interesting. Since I was under the impression it was going to be infested with 720 kids hence the ""five minute ride record release party thing."" But whatever. They played first and were not bad to my surprise. Met up with some friends inside. The pit was horrible. Kids were ""moshing"" not dancing. It was actually pretty funny though. During their set, the singer got all emotional when he dedicated a song to his deceased band member. It was pretty sad. After their set, the crew finally showed up. We all were in the back hanging out, and I saw this guy that looked hella like Ryan. But I was like naw, that cannot be him. Since he had hella short, non-pretty hair, minus mascara. So I asked Brendan where Ryan was and he pointed to that dude. I was like ""holy shit"". Ryan fucking hardcore cut his hair. But it was good to see him again. So we all went up to watch Taken perform. They were not too bad. Kids were still moshing. Some kid rammed into me so I ran in there and started windmilling and shit. Stupid fuck. After their set, Time in Malta came on. They got shit to start up. That is when I started dancing alot more with Ryan and shit. Finally some of the kids got the picture that it was a ""hardcore"" show not a fucking Deftones show or whatever. Some kid punched me in the head and I went off and started throwing swing kicks and windmills and shit. Kid got fucked up. After their set, I went to the bathroom and to get water. I tagged Adam along to get him some free shit from the Time in Malta booth. Then when I went to get water I met this cool punk girl. We talked for a little while and stuff. Then I walked back. I saw Ryan in the back with this cute girl and we started talking and stuff. She was cool. I do not remember her name. Maybe Johanna or something. Then Poison The Well started setting up. So Ryan and I went back to the middle of the circle with the crew. When I came back, Anthony was telling me that some fuck stepped on Aubree and she was like excuse you and he said something like you are stupid or some shit. So I was like fuck that. They pointed out who it was so I had my first target for the night. Poison The Well started playing and the whole place started getting crazy. Ryan And I started to kick people who would get close to us. Aubree, was kicking ass. She kicked hella people. I was proud of her. When they started playing Botchla shit got chaotic. That is when Ryan and I went in there and started fucking shit up. We both fucked up a few people. The double fucking threat, fa sho. When the song came to its climax and everyone was just standing, I ran into the middle and started doing my rapid windmill, then all the kids came in and started dancing too. It was great. When the song was over Ryan and I decided to do this tag-team windmill thing. I think it was Lazzaro that came on. So I layed on the floor and wrapped my legs around Ryan's waist and held my torso up with my hands, and we went in there and i would push up and he would hold me as I started doing fucking crazy ass windmills. It was beautiful. Everyone just stopped and watched us and clapped. We brought the mosh, lol. After that everyone shook our hands. It was seriously the best move him and I have done so far. After Poison The Well, we all just sat outside. Ryan and I were sick as hell with some stupid virus. So it was funny when we were both just sitting down coughing. After the show, we went to Denny's to eat. We were all tired and fucking out of it. It was a great night. It was fun to be with all my great friends and my bff Aubree. She got me this hella cool Ankh that I am gonna put on my rear view mirror once my car is working. That was my great night.

Daughters on fucking Thursday.

That show is going to fucking rock...

Farewell..."

"event","A man who wished to study the way of the bow traveled to a 
distant village to meet a great Kyudo master who lived there. When he 
reached the masters house he asked to be accepted as a student.
        
""I can teach you nothing,"" said the master, ""unless you can see properly.""
""but sensei, my eyes are fine,"" replied the man.

""If that is so, then I assume you can see the spider climbing along 
the garden fence,"" the master replied.

""Of course,"" said the man, ""I can see iit quite clearly.""

""Tell me then,"" asked the master, ""how clear are the spots on its body?""

""spots,"" the man asked incredulously. ""From this distance I cannot see any spots.""

""Then come back when you can,"" said the master.

The man was dissapointed. He was anxious to begin his study of 
Kyudo, but he new the master would never teach him unless he did what he 
was told. Reluctantly, He returned home. There, he took a small fly, tied 
it to a thread, hung it in his window. Day after day he stared at the fly 
in an attempt to make it larger. He tried everything. he stared at the 
fly with his eyes wide open. He teied squinting,or closing one eye. At 
one point he looking at the fly with his eyes crossed. But nothing 
worked. The fly always seemed like the tiny black speck that it was when 
he first hung it in the window. Finally he gave up an went to the master 
for help. 

""The secret,"" said the master . ""is not to look at the object with your 
eyes, but to see it with your 'mind's eye.'""

The man did not really understand what the master meant by this, 
but he went home and tried to do what he was told. At first, everything 
was the same as before. Gradually, however, he began to see the fly in 
more and more detail. It actually seemed to be growing larger. 
Eventually, he was able to to make out the wings, the eyes, even the hair 
on its body. It was almost as if the fly were right in front of him.
When the man was sure of his ability he went to see the master again.

""I can count the spots on the spider's body,"" said the man.

The master nodded his approval, then handed the man a bow and set 
of arrows. He pointed to a distant plum tree and told the man to shoot 
the lowest hanging fruit.

""I have never shot a bow before. I'll never be able to hit the fruit,"" said the man.

""you have learned all that is neccessary,"" replied the master. 
""use you sprit and you will not fail.""

The man drew the bow, then waited calmly for thr plum to grow 
larger. When the plum appeared to have closed the distance and to be 
touching the tip of his arrow, he let the arrow fly. A moment later he 
watched in amazement as the arrow pierced the plum right through the 
center. He shot again and again, each time with the same result..."

Then we came back to school for lunch. After that, Danielle, Ant, Adam and I hung out. Then we drove Danielle home. After that, I Went driving for a while. I was out of it. I pretty much became one with my car and I let it take me over and I drove without feeling or thought. It was odd. After that, Sean, Todd, Ant, and I, were shooting the bows in his backyard. Hella fun. Anthony sucks at Archery. Haha. Sean and I were fucking it up. Then we went to Arden and hung out for a few hours. We went to visit Danielle and got free ice cream and stuff. She rocks. Then I went to Forever 21 and saw this hella cool turtleneck I have been wanting. So I bought it. Then we jacked this caution sign with a light on it that never turns off. After that, we drove Danielle home and I tried to drive Anthony's car. Hella hard. Manual is hard shit. I stalled like four times, it was so funny. Then I went home and went to sleep. That was my Night. Farewell..."

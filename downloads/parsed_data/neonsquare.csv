I mean, everyone has past.  Everyone's done things, or people, or has memories or whatever.  Your past is to be respected and learned from.  And moved on from. Its so frustrating that other people's past has such a huge effect on me.  I wasn't even there, for christs sake.  But look at us now, paying the price.  You and who you are because of who you were.  And I will be who I will be because of who you are. (This is turning into a funeral for friend song, and I want out. . .NOW)

The past is over.  Lets move on.  Thats not who we are anymore.  I'm certainly trying.  What a wasted life of fear and insecurity.  Of self doubt.  self loathing perhaps.  

I think I'm the kind of person that no one appreciates until its too late.  I know I'm not who you wanted me to be or who you thought I'd be, but here I am.     I'm all wrong, but I'm all right, in that classic juxtaposition sort of way. Paint by number fantasies are for suckers.  And I learned from a good friend this weekend that you should never let time or circumstances stand in the way of your happiness.  So quit standing in your own way and lets get it together.


I've been waiting for you.  And lets be honest, I don't wait for anyone."

I've missed have computers and internet at my own disposal.  I really enjoyed the everyday opportunity to bare my soul for the world on the interweb.  Oh well.  I suppose I'll start keeping a hand written journal that you won't find until you're cleaning out my room when I'm dead.  And then you'll publish it and I'll be the next Sylvia Plath.  Except less sad.

 

I'd like to state, for whatever records your keeping, that I'm okay with me.  I like me.  Most of the time.  Some of the time.  I'm okay with my personality and my style and my habits and who I am.  And if you're not, thats ok.  Just tell me.  Don't pretend.  Don't put on fronts.  Cause it doesn't matter.  And if the thing that you hate about me is so insignficant that you don't even bother to tell me, lets make sure we don't tell other people.  Cause then you look like a shit talker.  And lets be honest, who wants that?

I'm me.  No worries.  This is all you're getting.  And that's more than enough.  Plenty.  (apparently a little more than enough) I like it, and hopefully, with an luck in the world, I'll find someone else who does.  Scary thing is, I think I may have.  But thats another blog for another time.  

 

Life is great, no worries.  I love you.  More than you know, and thats the truth."

This is the diary of Rachel, Broken in Leg and Spirit.


It's amazing what you learn about yourself and others in time of crisis.

I suppose I shouldn't flatter myself and even think for a second that my broken leg is a crisis, but I guess you know what I mean.

My job seems to be getting along without me.  I'm sure they need people to push the truck and back up cashier, but apparently they've found another monkey to help with that.  

Apparently my friends seem to be doing ok as well.  Haven't gotten as many calls or visits.  Bastards.  There were a dozen people around when I broke my leg and guess how many have come to my aid at this point--- none.  Jack holes.  Except Michael Burch I guess.  But probably cause I call him.  

Oh and I also learned today that everyone knows Panic! at the disco and I'm so unoriginal for liking them and referencing them on my myspace.  but apparently making fun of me for it because everyone thought it was funny is completely original.  and then changing it cause i told you to is also the epitome of originality.  

Oh and get this.  So my mom calls me today and says she is going with my dad to look at house my sister and her boyfriend want to buy.  OK great.  I'm pretty bored by 5 in the afternoon but I'm ok with it cause my sister is spending the night tonight so we'll probably have family dinner and stuff.  About 2 hours later I call my mom cause I'm really getting antsy and at this point I forget what my own voice sounds like and she says they actually just finished but they are going to go out to eat and then be home.  That's nice.  Have a nice fucking time.  I guess there's a new family unit and I'm not a part of it.  They didn't even try and invite me or include me.  Just announce they are going.  you've got to be freaking kidding me.

Around 8:30 they all roll in, well fed and satisfied at life.  My father has the mail so I start to go through it looking for my next round of bills.  No bills, but you know what was there. . . 2 invitations to my cousins birthday party.  One address to ""emily & eric"" (apparently they don't know emily's new address) and one addressed to ""mr and mrs rocky gonzalez, & family"" but the family part was really squished to make it fit on the envelope.  And family?!  For those of you keeping score at home-- thats just me.  There's no other ""family"".  They can't just write my god damn name?  Apparently if you aren't in some sort of serious relationship you don't get an invitation to a one year olds birthday party.  Is there a god damn seating chart?  My mother then announces that it doesnt matter cause we aren't going.  Although my sister is.  Apparently when you don't get your name on an invitation you also don't get to decide if you're going or not.  

i'm so annoyed with life that i can't even explain it.  

I did get advice from one person and they told me to ""cheer up.""  well jesus-- i'd never thought of that.  

i'd really like for someone to be honest and tell me if i'm really worth the trouble or if i'm just the burden to society that i fell like.  its ok-- don't be afriad to hurt my feelings.


oh and for the record-- its a terrible idea to put your name on the grouphug.us search engine.  you then think every entry that comes up is about you and you feel like even more shit after that.  

i'm so emo i should knit a sweater and buy myself a promise ring."

"event","So the whole broken leg things sucks.  It's sucking a little less now that I'm officially not working and just taking time to heal.  

I've bought a knitting kit but its still sitting on the floor in a bag. 

Today I cleaned out my CD collection.  I figure it its on the I Pod, and I have no real emotional attachment to it, why not get rid of it?  It's all about a simpler, more steamlined lifestlye for me these days.  I currently have 4 auctions on EBay for lots of CD's, including everything from Pink to Lil Bow Wow to Janet to David Cassidy to JLo and even John Mayer.  Funny how you don't realize you have 2 copies of the same CD until they are spread all over the floor and you can't really get up.  But I did find my copy of Jason Mraz, Live at the Eagle's Ballroom.  I broke the CD a long time ago, but I just found the DVD.  Should occupy my attention for about an hour tomorrow.


I'm a little suprised people aren't missing me more.  not as many phone calls or get well cards as I thought.  haven't gotten either from the person who caused this broken leg either.  bastard.  also haven't gotten either from some people I would have labeled as close friends.  also bastards.  I guess I should have caught on that these people sucked when they pulled the same shit when my uncles died.  but for some reason I just can't stop myself from being a friend to them.  Does that make sense?  I can't be heartless or cold to people around me, just strangers and hobos.  that sounded mean.  

I also found a use for the bag full of folders under my bed and made a little organizational system for myself.  I had all my bills and concert tickets and pay stub and paperwork and crap just piled on my night stand and I could never find anything and then lord knows if I paid it or not.  it was just a nightmare, but I think I've got it figured out now.  I feel good about it.

I also found the best activity in life.  I put my little ear phones in my ears while watching TV.  When the commercial comes on, I hit play on the I Pod comes on.  TV comes back, hit pause.  Shuffle is my bitch.  It's pretty good for fighting bordem.  

I have a pretty big week planned.  Hair appointment on Wednesday and lunch with the sister on Friday.  To be honest with you, I'll be wiped out after both.  The lack of proper sleep due to pain, the scripts, and extra 30 pounds of plaster wrapped around my leg, and the extra effort to walk with crutches, and the extra effort to get ready, and the all around pain in the ass of it all really takes it out of me.  I'm such an old lady now.  

Also, thank God the Lifetime has just edited it's daytime line up.  1pm was the stop of sitcoms and the start of unsolved mysteries and I always had to switch to channel and the only other thing on was the steve harvey show which sucks.  but they just added ""frasier"" at 1 and moved robert stack and his creepy-ness to 2pm.  2pm is nap time for me.  

ok this is long and i'm boring myself.  

i love you and miss you and want you to come visit, call, email or something.  connect with me."

3. I'm buying a puppy-- my mother is finally okay with it.

4.  I feel like a big sticky ball.

5. That came out grosser than intended."

"event","A few things I learned today:


1) It's a really nice feeling when you see someone from your past, and for one reason or another, you're suddenly glad you didn't return that phone call 2 years ago.

2) Deck parties are a good time.

3) My Dad is sick again.  Please pray for him.

4) I hope one day I'm comfortable."

"event","Please be advised of the most random setlist ever:

Crane
Rocket Man
Plane Goes Down
I'm Yours



That's right people. . . 

I hope someone out there appreciates that.



I won't bore you with the details, but let's just say it was a beautiful day and night and the entire experience of a 20 minute set was well worth the drive.  I felt pretty good when I woke up this morning.


The Bike Song
(set to the beat of ""Candy Girl"", by New Edition)

I like my bike
oh oh oh oh
I like my bike
oh oh oh oh
Banana Seat
My Favorite Treat
It don't hurt my feet
Ladies Shoes
They come in two's
oh oh oh oh
light my fuse





on a side note: i had the most beautiful dream last night.  Everything that life should be and exactly how i want it.  I said everything I wanted to say,and it was taken at that.  I feel even more complete because of the dream.  thanks."

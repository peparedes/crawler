"event","so, i decided that i probably should let you all know whats been going on in my life.

*i got addicted to myspace.....and now i cant get offof it. they really need a rehab for myspace...

*i got in an accident with my car...before it was my car...and before i had a license....and left my home almost immeadietly after it had happened. i had a feeling i was going ot get kicked out anyway....and i was wrong.

*tyler and i are still togather and lived togather for 4 months.

*we got engaged....and this time....its for real.

*i lived with
   -bobby danger
   -opal (but i guess we dont talk anymore. 'i broke to many rules while i lived there'. i broke a few. and i did deserve to get kicked out. i just wish norma culd have told ME this unstead of calling my mother...who i didnt even live with anymore and telling her this)
   -i lived in/out of my car for a few days
   -lived with this guy named jake who screwed tyler and i royally by not telling us he was getting evicted, and when he did, i had half of my possesions at his house when the land loard took the keey and threw everything away. i lost my job the exact same day.
   -i dont remember where i was when my car broke down in portland. i cant remember worth shizznit
   -i lived with asian andy in the middle of no where for a month. he was pretty cool, except for the whole trying to rape me in my sleep thing. almst right after that, tyler and i left. he tryed doing it while tyler was in the bed next to me. not cool!!
   -lived with heatherface for a few weeks
   -moved in with amanda, chris, jon, and loren for a month. it was nice there. we payed rent by cleaning and cooking everyday. but after new years we got 48 hours to get out, because chris thought we dissobeyed his rules by having our friends over for new years. if it wasnt for that, we'd probably be there....
   -my parents let me stay with them for a few days after that. and i over stayed my welcome i guess. hey, they didnt give me a day to leave. and i was looking for a job everyday. finnaly, my mom asked when i was leaving and had this look like...'you are way over due to leave'
   -nicki gave me a permanent place on her couch. im living here and persuing my modeling career. im doing well. i havnt made any money yet, bt im building my portfolio and i have a few assignments that are paying. that money os going into an account that i will not take money out of for a long time because tyler and i are going to have our own space. just me and him.

things that happened in between....

*i got arrested...shoplifting is a bitch after you get arrested!! but hey....i needed clean underwear.

*i got a tattoo...out line of a heart on my right pelvic area.

*got the bellybutton pierced

*took my nipple piercings out ecause my body didnt agree with them

*tyler was in a mental hospital because his parents dont know how to treat a son. he was there for 3 weeks....and i was in a 3 week depression.

*went to bend for christmas

*my parents thought i stole money from my sister before i left. i didnt, but they dont have to believe me because they wont anyway. as tristin says ""it was there when you came, and gone when you left""  dont know where it went. and i dont like the accusing. 

*my parents basicly dissowned me because they thought i stole money from them

*tyler got arrested for jaywalking and was put in a shelter because his parents didnt want him and now he just got free housing and hes on the prowel for a job that he can keep.

*im looking for a job at a piercing place so i can get an apprenticeship and pierce. i live it. its an addrenalin rush and it makes me happy

*i did some experimentation.....and i think i got dumber in the process. i tryed 'x' and it was amazing...but way to addictive for me...so thats a  big no no. and i found a like for beer....

thats mostly it

oh, matt hates tyler....thinks hes sneeking on me and doesnt fnd him troustworthy enough. and matt is still in love with me. i love him too, but i love tyler more, and tyler treats me way better.

the band broke up....

i want to sing for another one

The Lost Souls

If you can't stand upon the water I will see you on the ocean floor. When you blink do you only find the misery between the lines? Then take my hand and walk with me. Come to me, your sanctuary, I'll gladly accept the gift that I've been granted. If you feel fine, then give it just a little time I'm sure you'll contract my disease. Look what you've done to me now, you've made me perfect. If you can't stand upon the earth then I will meet you on the other side. When you blink do you only find the misery weighs down your eyes? Then take my hand and sleep with me. Take my hand I'll be everything to you. Take my hand I'll take everything from you. I will seep under your skin. I will. I will hold onto your heart. I will.

i wrote 2 songs, and added some lyrics to one of jons. they are the most awsomest songs in the universe. lol. probably not, but i like to think they are.

i dont have much to say. i got to see mattson on saturday, and that was way awsome because i dont get to see him as much as i would like to anymore, so it was good to see him again. nicki invited me to go to the zone with them on saturday, but since i never get to see my lover, i wanted to stay with him, plus i was moneyless. im going to the escape on saturday if anyone else wants to go. $10. wooooo!!

my sister is going to prom. we have to go  and look for a freakin dress for her today, wich isnt that bad, because then i get to cheak out jewelry and stuff. i kind of need that aspect. i have to sparkle!

remember:
im not a fucking whore!
iM JUST A FUCKING SLUT!

went to the mall with nicki, james, kevin, mattson and my best friend jason (lol). it was fun. matt seemed to not want to be there, and it was kind of bugging me, but he told me he was just out of it and he felt bad. no biggie. my ear bled in the lovesac place and had to go to the bathroom to clean it up. i was still a little mad that matt was acting wierd, so i was feeling kind of sick. we went back to lovesac and then decided to go to chilli's and when we where leaving the store my heart gave out and i started crying. to much going on i guess. so we ate chips and salsa at chilli's and then i went to matts house and we talked and had a good time. we slept naked togather, and i almost got up and danced, but i didnt. all in all, it was a good day on tuseday.

so, yeah. band practice tonight, i have to write some lyrics, and actually get like a tune going somehow. i can do it!!!!

"event","so, i never got to see matt yesderday, he never returned my calls. whatever i guess. i'll live. hopefully i get to see him soon though.


i saw jed today. that was exciting. he still wants to write the score for my movie, wich is was fucking awsome because he's an amazing artist.


my shoulderblades are brused and sore because kreig rubbed my back and shoulders was to hard, and now im all hurty and whatnot.


im tired beyond all reason. i need to catch up on my sleep.


i have a ton of art homework because i havnt been doing it, and i really badly need to. if i dont, then i might not pass, and that would be BAD!!


i need a shower

i was listining to fallout boy this morning, and i realized how much i like them. they surely do kick much ass and there are a few songs that just remind me so much of myself and other people good songs if they do that to a person.

me and my mommy watch finding neverland lastnight, and i cryed so hard. the part where she goes into neverland just makes me want to bawl my freaking eyes out. 


life on a stick is a way awsome show. i love it. i now have a new series that i must watch whenever p[ossible! woooooo!!!


i got my new meds yesderday. i dpnt have an appitite, i feel sick sometimes, and there is a good chance of vomiting and dihareah. lovely, so not only will i be skinny, i'll be mallnutritioned, and dieing.

so, i had a crunch wrap supreme today, and it was the most tasty thing i have EVER had. it was good. and only $1.79. woot woot!!!


so, if you want to go dancing with me comming up here soon, raise your hand. i want to go so bad. it would be way awsome to have someone who drives come with us, because i dont drive, and being stranded in portland AGAIN doesnt sound all to appealing. the club costs $10 and it starts at 10pm. theres a drag queen show in the middle, about 2 am or so, and lots and lots of dancing. FREE CONDOMS! FUN FREE CONDOMS!!! all ages, non-alcoholic fun. i enjoy it. i love it, and most of the guys there, are half naked and makin out. its a gay club by the way. its hot, and people need to go with me. especially someone with a freakin' car!!!!

*sigh*

so, i wrote 3 pages to my movie, and i had to stop because i got into a really bad spot. anyone want to know what its about??? huh huh??? well, its no zombie movie, because thats too expencive and i have NO money. so, its a love story slash murder thingy. its good, and im stuck. my teacher likes it, and she has no idea that it will be all grusome and nasty like. woooooo!!!

MATT COME OVER TODAY!!! I MISS YOU!!!!!!

later

so, the safeway pharmacy called me on friday, i think, and told me that the Paxil im taking isnt being made anymore, so i have to wait for regular paxil (i was taking the CR) or go to my doctor and have her give me a new perscription for something compleately different. im having an OK time copeing with the loss of my meds, but its not that bad. im not breaking down and bawling every 5 seconds or anything. im just a little more hyper active, and randomness seems to seep through my mouth. no biggie. i dont feel bad, and thats good.

woooo! im working on my prom dress tonight!! *dances to a funky jig*. im so excited. i cant wait. *dances some more*

"event","jesus fuck

i dont want kids.
ive decided this. and i will keep it. i'll have the baby, but once the reach talking age, gone! they talk back, yell, annoy, and make you want to rip your face off!! jesus fuck. i'll take cats over 2 or 3 year old children anyday. take them untill they are 15 and give 'em back. i'll be happy.





okay, so i tryed super hard not to think about matt and what he's doing, who he's doing it with and if he's thinking about me. it worked untill i got in the shower and started to sing the song that i basicly dedicated to him because its my favorite long and i wanted to share it with him. i cryed. i hate being this far away. 

i talk about him way to much huh? complain as well. god damn it. whay am i so STUPID!!!! i just feel like theres something wrong. i cant keep this to myself because i need to get it out. if you bottle something up for to long then something bad happens, and then depression and anger sets in and then theres tears and fights and whatnot. so, im just going to say it. i write to him, he doesnt respond. i dont know. maybie im just losing my mind. falling into a dreamland that isnt happy. like alices glass tears. fuck. fuckidy fuck fuck. there is one thing that makes me hurt so bad its not even fair. he loves emily, who lives in like iowa, and that just tears me appart because the fact that he can love some one and really mean it while he's loving me is making a scorching hot hole in my heart. sure, i've had my shares of loves, but neither of them talk to me anymore, one of them was an ass and the other is so obsessed with his girlfriend that he doesnt even know i exist anymore. god, we used to be best friends. he'd come over and we'd watch movies or just sit around and chat, then he would walk home and call me to see if he misses me. of course i did. whats not to miss? he was the greatest guy alive. now he doesnt even notice my existiance. how come everyone i love always yurns out to hate me? jason hates me, i know that much. he asked my why i was calling when he knew, and then wouldnt talk to me because something more importiant was going on. i dont think matt hates me, i just think he's fed up with me. like, he's done. you know, like every other ass face ive dated. I JUST WANT A GUY WHO'S GOING TO TALK TO ME, CARE ABOUT ME, AND E-MAIL ME BACK!!!!! GOD FUCKING DAMN IT! 

he doesnt even miss me. i feel it in my heart.
fuck my heart. i dont think theres much of it left anyway.

im going to cry again. i feel that hottness that you get when your just about to cry behind my eyes. god, i hate crying. it gets you no where.

anyway, back to  my rambeling that gets me no where and makes me feel no better:
he's falling away. like, he's just trying to dissapear and hope i dont notice it. well, i do. i cant help it. he's my fucking boyfriend for gods sake! 
maybe im just jelous of emily. she lives all the way in iowa, and im fucking jelous of her. they have never met or anything, and he loves her. im just about to say whatever, and hope thay are happy with each other. 
it bugs me that he goes to her before he comes to me with a problem. he cant tell me my flaws and what i do wrong because he feels it will hurt me. i've been hurt enough by way worse things and telling me that i put people on guilt trips isnt going to hurt my feeling that bad. he doesnt tell me anything. its like im left out of it all. im just there for him to fuck around with and kiss and to hold his hand. (i am NOT going to cry!!) i want him to be able to talk to me the way he does to her.

*sigh*
im sad and pathetic.
i needed to get all of that out or else i was going to explode. 
im sorry for wasting your time.

i love you all,
stefany"

before the movie, even really creaped me out. this boy has so manyt things wrong with him, i swear. he's 8. okay. he was picking at a scab on his leg, and i was trying to tell him not to do it, but he said he wanted to so the blood can come out and he can suck on it. i was like, wait a minute. then he said he liked the look of the blood on his sock, and that it tastes so good, that he would like to have it on toast everyday. then he added, 'not my own blood, of course'. i had to have dianna talk to him because he was being wierd. the boy need help. a lot and a lot of help!

im ready to go home. i miss my friends and family so much. i miss my bed with the dark window the most. waking up to the light is a no no. i need a shower, my hair feels all funky and such. . . .

i went into matts journal, and read a few from before we where dating, and now, im like totaly jelous of chantelle, because he wrote about her more. he actually wrote when they where dating. he doesnt write about me, or even wirtte period. now, im stupidly jelous, and i know i shouldnt be because they hardly even talk anymore, but still. its one of those phsycological things that just slaps you upside the head and kicks you right in the ass.

im pathetic arnt i?
just say yes.

spoot.

i miss marlena. 
i miss her so much.
i miss opal too.
we talked for a very long time on saturday, and that was awosme. i miss talking with her. i need to get her away from joe for a while so i can have her for myself. i love her and miss her dearly. i'll drag her with marlena and i to the escape onne of these weekends.

it sucks that matt doesnt dance. he would have fun at the gay club.
oh, and he decided he didnt want to go to prom with me, wich is fine. im not going to GUILT TRIP him in to going, because i know better. someone will go with me. . . . i hope. thats a lot of prettyness to waste on no one. maybe he'll go to the after prom party at opals house. that would be awsome. i want to get drunk with him. and high maybe too. i miss doing all that. im not supposed to (satanist thing), because it clouds the mind and makes it harder the think, wich is true, but sometimes, you just want to get stoned and run naked through the woods (wich is something i suggest to anyone who loves nature that much). when my dress for prom is ready, i'll post a pic so you all can see me in all my beauty. . (cough, gag). . . .

god. im just full of nothing lately.
it seems like i have nothing to say that anyone would actually want to hear about.
meah.
i'll get over it.

someone else i miss dealry. . . . mitch.
i wish emily hadnt taken away from me. he was my best friend, and he made me feel special. he's one of those people you just cant get out of your head, even when you want to. he's gorgious, but he can be an ass-hole. he cares/cared for me so much. i miss that. i want my best friend back!!!!!!! mitchell! come back and make me smile with gleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! 

*sigh*

i really am pathetic. . . . *raises eyebrow*

useless info. . . .BIRDS DO NOT PUT YOU TO SLEEP!!!!

blahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!

spoot spoot woot woot spoot woot woot woot woot woot spoot (in honor of marlena)

CHICKEN ANUS (BROK BROK) CHICKEN ANUS (WOOOOOOO). . . . . ahhh, the good 'ol days, when walking to the 'big asshole' in the rain wasnt that hard, and singing about the anus of a chicken was the way we expressed ourselves. i miss you marlena!!!!!!

oreo's sound awsome. i wonder if there are any here. . . . maybe i'll look.

"event","this is going to be odd, comming from me, the satanist.
sometimes, you just need to pray for the one person that you would give your life for, and hope they are happy, even when they feel low and helpless.
in my religion, the word 'pray' is shunned. right now, it means the world.

i pray for you hunny.
i pray for your happyness
i pray for your tranquility
i pray for your love
i pray for your family
i pray for your strength to get through
i pray for you.

im scared for matt.
sometimes, when i think he's doing alright, he's not. if anything, he's broken down into a million little pieces and laying in bed. it breaks my heart to know that he is not happy at all. sometimes i think he isnt happy with me in the slightest. i wish there was something i could do. right now, praying is all i have. my aunt is helping me with this, concidering how new i am to the whole idea. we prayed while we did yoga and i feel like something has gotten through, but im not totaly sure.
GOD, i would give my life for this boy to be happy. why isnt he happy? it just puts an icy cold stone on my already weak heart.

shit.

maybe im jsut a terrible girlfreind who cant make her boyfriend emotionally and/or physically happy. what is wrong with me???????

*sigh*

fish.
well, that did nothing for me. . . . 

oaky, well, venting has not helped me. maybe things will be better when i get home. i'll be home either thursady or friday. im not even sure anymore. i kind of want to stay here forever. no problems, no worries, as much yoga as i want, good food, and the air here is happy and hateless. i love this house. i love this family. i only wish i didnt have worries, so i could have apeaceful and relaxing vacation. all i can think about is whether or not mattson is happy, well, cut free, and peaceful.
god, how much i love him. . . .

"event","ive realized that hardly anyone really cares about how i feel.
when i feel sad, no one asks whats worng.
when im angry, people dont even know i exist
when im physicly falling appart, bleeding, and crying, people just ignore it and ask how my day was.

why dont i have friends that care?

so, i had to force myself to not cry when i was talking to matt, because i got a vibe that he didnt want to see me. i called him to ask if he wanted to keep me company while i was at the auction, but he wasnt home, and never called me back to say that he couldnt see me. then i told him that im leaving tomarow, and that i wont see him for a week, and he just made a little noise, like, eah, whatever, and thats when i got the feeling like he didnt want to see me. he didnt even make an effort to come up and say goodbye before i leave. god, that hurts me so bad. and for the 3rd time this week, im crying at the fucking school, and i cant stop it. is just everything around me turning into shit? do people hate me that bad? god, my own boyfriend didnt make an effort to see me. i hate to say it, but its sort of showing the signs of my relationship with jason angelo again. jason never said goodbye when i left for somewhere, he went days without seeing me or calling me, and he didnt give a damn about me and how i feel. matt loves me, he'll say it, but lately, he doesnt show it, and its bringing me down into a deep hole of depression. i have more cuts on my body then i had when i was in the hospital 2 years ago.i dont want to say that he is the reason for me hurting myself, because thats my problem. i love him so much. and i dont know what i would do if he just stoped loving me back. ive gone through it before, and i almost ended up dead. i dont want to be dead yet. i just want to feel. i want him to come up to me and say goodbye before i leave for a week, but not everything can happen. maybe im just not cut out to be happy all the time.

when tears fall like rain
and blood runs like a river
then you know that things are falling appart
why cant everything turn out the way its supposed to?


i really need a hug.
i need one so bad.




i love him
does he love me?



shit.

he loves me. . . 
he loves me not.. . . 

he cares about me. . . .
or he doesnt. . . 

i want out of this depression! its eating me alive. i havnt been this depressed in so long!

i pierced my ear today.
another infection i guess.
maybe my ear will fall off.

shit.

matt,
i dont know what to say.
i try so hard to make sure i get to see you as often as you want to see me, but im slowly noticing that your fading away. are you sick of me? is there someone better waiting for you somewhere else? if there is, it wouldnt be the first time i was left for someone better. i cant even count that times when thats happened. too many i guess. heh. . .
im breathing so hard, and my heart is beating so fast, that i dont know if its going to break through my chest. 
if only i wasnt so weak.
minutes
hours
days
what next?
just tell me, are we fine? because i need reasuriance.

i love you."

I woke up in a cold sweat, crying, nose bleeding into my throught and talking to myself. i remember the dream vividly.

-----my dream-----

I was in a cell. it was dark, and there was a presence about me that terrifyed me. i was naked in this cell. my arms where attached to my ankles, and i was huddled in a fetal possition on the cold cement i remember tasting blood in my throught. My body was wet with sweat and water. i was crying

A door opened in the floor, and a small man climbed through holding a black cane in his hand. he walks over to me, and starts beating me with the cane. im crying harder, and telling him to stop, your hurting me. he doesnt stop.

-----FLASH-----
Im laying in my bed, but it isnt my bed, its matts, and we're in my room. im huddeled against the cold wall and he's holding me and telling me to clam down. i roll over, and notice that it isnt matt, its the man that was beating me. i scream. he holds me down and rapes me, knowing how much pain im in. he hits me accross the face.

I wake up now.
my nose is actually bleeding, and i hope to stay awake for the rest of the night, but i soon fall back into dream land where i dont remember what happened, only waking up and feeling dirty and used.

i hate dreams like these.

On a happier note. . . . . .
i dyed my hair lastnight. its now like a purple, red, blackishly lovly color that i addore. it almost looks brown in somelight, but if i shift some, then it looks purple, or red. pretty awsome i might say.

Matt got to see me in all my hair dyeie glory, as well as the lovely smell that accompinies it. it wasnt that bad. i just wish i wasnt wearing my robe, because my bobbies where falling forth. lol. i dont have much boobs to fall, but i can pretned. HAHAHAHAHA!!

I hope i still get to go to the beach. . . . . .


so, matt asked me if i had twilight school today, and i do. i dont think i'll get to see him before i leave, because he dorsnt seem to want to come out here to see me. i deffinately would ride the bus, if i knew what time the god damned thing came, but i have to do laundry and clean my room tonight, so i couldnt go out there anyway. i want to ask him if he wants to come over, but i always feel so awkward because usually he'll just say 'ok, wel i'll shave, then i'll come out, k?' before i can even ask, and when he doesnt say that, it feels like he just doesnt want to drive here. i can understand that. it is a lot of gas to get here, and gas is money and whatnot. i just miss him.

Im having mattson withdrawls. im getting depressed and whatnot because hes not here, and it will be worse if i dont get to see him by 2:40pm tomarow because then i dont get to see him for 3 or 4 more days (we might stay untill monday if all goes well with the family and all)!!!!!!! GRRRAH!


i need a nappy-poo

peace out biotch,

LAtely nothing to exciting has happened. marlena and i went to the Escape in portland and had the best time ever with the gay boys and girls. i stayed at mars house, and slept in untill like 1, because we didnt get to sleep untill 5:30ish AM.

Matt and i have been chillin; some. not as much as we used to, and i dont know why that is, but no matter i guess. i wish i could see him more. i want to see him today, but i have twilight school untill 5, and i doubt he'll want to come out here, and i dont know the new sam times, so i dont know if i could even get out there before 6. i really want to see him though. at least before friday, because im leaving right after school to go to the beach for the weekend, and friday is the only day i dont have twilight school. i hope i can see him before then. 

i pierced my ear lastnight. it doesnt hurt at all, but it bled like a bitch when i pulled the needle out and put the earing in. no matter. it looks awsome, and i think i'll do the other ear tonight. woot woot!

im going to pierce my nipples on graduation day, ive decided. i was just going to pierce my nose, but if i get the nipps done, my parents dont see them, and they cant be all pissy and whatnot. im excited. its going to hurt so bad though. i just know it.

anyway, i have to get to class. my photo pics didnt turn out, so i have to take more today durring class. no matter. i like taking pictures. woooooo!!!

I didnt go to school yesderday because i got food poisinging on monday, and that really sucks. that night, i had a very starnge dream. . . 

I was at my AUnt Sabrah's house, and matts van, my dads truck, and a clothesline where outside. I remember that Matt and Chantelle where at my aunts house with me, and i went inside to get something to eat, i grabbed triscuts, and i remember seeing chantelle inside the laundry room before i went back outside. i stopped to look in the mirror, and then went out to the lawn. my dads truck was moving, and then the phone rang. matt answered it from the back of my dads truck, in the bed, compleately naked. he dropped the phone and looked at me like 'you shouldnt be seeing this' and i looked inside the truck, and there was chantess, crurled up in a fetal posision crying. she knew she was in trouble. matt started yelling at me and i strated crying. 
i woke up from the dream in a pannic, crying and breathing so chard it hurt. my body was shaking, and then i threw up in my trash can. all i could think of that day was that dream, and it worried me. im trying to forget me, but when i dream sticks with me for longer then one day (its two days now) then that usually means that something bad will happen. im worried."

"event","i hate not being able to sleep. i woke up this morning tired and my eyes hurt because i cryed a little last night. i told mattson, that i didnt want to tell him why i was crying, because it was sort of about jay. yesderday was our 2 month anniversery and i wanted to see matt, but he didnt want to drive up or something. i dont know he didnt really give me a reason, and i just remembered that whenever i wanted to see jason, he would drive up while i was talking to him and surprise me when the doorbell rang. id be like, ""hold on someones at the door"" and then it would be a happy little surprise when he'd drive up, no matter how late it was. if it was 9 at night, and he could only stay untill 10, he'd drive up anyway to spend that small little 30 minutes with me before he had to go. it was sweet, and i only wish matt would do something like that for me. i cant make him do it, but it was nice to get that knock on the door when i was sad and needed a hug. i mean, it was our 2 month, and he just didnt want to drive or something, so it just kind of bugged me a little. no big deal i guess. im over it now.

I was supposed to go and stay at my grandmas house over the weekend, but im not gong to anymore. they are going somewhere i guess and they said it would just be too much of a hastle to have someone else with them, or something. i understand. i'll just use this weekend to sleep in and catch up on all that sleep ive been missing out on. im going to borders after school because my mom doesnt get off work untill 7, and we have to be at dinner at 8, so im just going to go the her work untill she gets off. maybie i'll call matt and see if he wants to hang out or something. if not, then i have plenty of books i can read. woot woot! i still want to see my lover though.


I wish i could see matt. i miss him. i really needed a matt hug lastnight too. i would have felt much better.

so, i was supposed to earn $300 by the 11th, and now i only need $150. I PASSED AMERICAN LIT! WOOT WOOT! so, i need help figuring out what i can do to earn this $150 for my classes. i want to graduate this year, so i have to take a twilight school class, and i might do it through mt.hood in stead of at sandy. im nto sure. so, if anyone has any ideas, let me know.

i havnt been sleeping lately. well, i have, just not to well. i always feel like i only got like an hour or less of sleep when i try to get up in the morning. it's terrible. my mom thinks its because i have anxiety about somehting, only i dont think i do. i wish i knew why i wasnt sleeping well. it would make sence to me to know. i think im going to have my mom take me to the doctor and get one of those sleep deprivation test thingys done, if this sleeplessness doesnt clear up soon.

BLARD!

im so thirsty. i just want something to drink, but i have no money and no one would give me sips or anything. im a thirsty little fishy.

i got a cactus. his name is izaih. he is an awsome cactus. i bought him so he would keep mahomed (my lawn gnome) company. *sigh* i have no life, and its really very sad. i name the random little things in my room. i need a life ora job. either one might help me from naming the random things that i slowly collect. . . . 

im ridding the bus out to matts house today. he wanted to just drive here, but i wouldnt let him. i asked why he doesnt want me at his house, and he said he did, it would just be easier for him to go to my house, wich isnt all that true because i can just get on the bus from school, ride to the first greshem stop, and he can pick me up there. its not that hard, and every time i want to do just that, he always just says he'll drive here. NO! I WANT TO RIDE THE BUSS DAMN IT! lol. i want to save the boy gas and money. i care.

I didnt finnish my American Lit finnal, so i just left before it so i didnt have to embaras myself more then i needed to. So i came home, went on myspace wrote matt messages because im to scared to talk to him on the phone, because he has this thing where he doesnt like talking to em on the phone because i rarely have anything interesting to say. . . no, he just doesnt like that bit of long silence that seeps in through the phone when we talk. i guess thats fine. i just wish i could have seen him today. i really want to. he's sick though, and im going to be around a baby next week, and he just got done being sick and in the hospital. I really want to see him though. I asked if i could ride the bus to his house, but i have no responce yet. no biggie i guess. i just hope i get it in the morning so i know if i have to catch the SAM or not. Maybie i'll just call him later tomarow because MySpace is banned from SHS. that sucks big ass penis.

Im tired because i slept and im tired because i havnt sletp well lately because ive been stressing these finnals. im having such a bad time with all of them. im not going to pass at least 3 classes because i just suck that much. i guess all my junior sandy friends will be seeing me next year as well! wooo! super senior. . *cough gag*
school sucks dick.
im thinking about dropping out, actually. i know i shouldnt, and its better to go back for your 5th year then not go at all, but i just want to get it over with. no more for stefany. its killing her very very slowly. if i had money, i would pay someone to pass my classes for me, or do my homework. either one. i dont know. i just want out.

"event","Im falling into a hole and it doesnt feel good.
Me and my parents got into a fight on saturday. I wanted to go driving and my mom said i couldnt because she thought i didnt try hard enough to get a job on friday. i just wanted to go driving a little, so i asked her what i could do to be able to drive, and she said get a job and pay for my own car. so, i still wanted to go, and i was trying to figure out what i could do, and my dad got mad at me because he thought i was being dissrespectful and started yelling and telling me to go to my room. i told him i wasnt going to go because i wanted to know what i could do to go driving, and he just blew up. he stomped over to me, grabed me by my hair and tryed to drag me into my room. i fought back of course, and i was crying because he was ripping my scalp off (no joke). he kicked me in the neck and in the back with all his force and i sat there gasping and crying and feeling like a was going to die. he told me to suck it up and that it really didnt hurt that bad. i got up, kicked him with all my force in his groin and ran outside. I started to walk down the road and then i just stoped. i needed a breather, so i sat down by me neighbors fence and cryed for 20 minutes and then my mom pulls up to me and tells me to go home. i told her that im not going to because a real father doesnt hurt his childern, no matter how mad he is. she just laughed at me and i stopmed back into the house, slammed the door, and went into my room. she throws me a suitcase and tells me to pack up because she doesnt want me living in her house anymore. i flip and tell her shes a fucking bitch ebacsuee i didnt do anything but ask if i could drive. she hit me. that set me off. if someone is going to punch me in the face, they are getting it back. so, we're in a full blown fist fight, i broke her glasses, she scratched me a little, both of us where hurting. she told me a wasnt worth her time and that she hated me and that she doesnt love me anymore and that she never wants to see me again. i packed my bag, grabbed a razor, went out into the livingroom, and told her 'you made me do this. if you dont love me, i dont love yu, and i dont want to be here.' i now have a gash down the middle of my left arm that bled for maybie 2 hours, and if you look closely, theres blood on the pavement at the park. I grabed my bag, rad out of the house and started for the road. she followed me all the way there, and she tryed to make it look like she wasnt behind me, but i could see her. i was running, crying, bleedng, and hurting, and by the time i got up to joes donuts i couldnt breath and passed out on the sidewalk. my mom just walks up, kicks me in the side and tells me to get up because im being a drama queen. if im bleeding on the pavement, does that make you a drama queen?? i think i was pretty damn serious. after i had gotten up i p[ushed her over, ran out into the road in hopes that someone will hit me, but no one did. i just got yelled at by random people in their cars. when i got up to the cross wallk, sue had grabbed me and so did my mom and they made me get into sues car, while leaving blood everywhere. we got to the house and sue made me talk to her, i didnt want to, but i was practicly forced to. my mom had called my grandma and she was on her way to pick me up. i didnt want to go. so, when she got there, she just sat and talked with me, i went with her and she was very mad about the fact that i had cut myself, but she doesnt realize that it needed to happen because otherwise i wouldnt have felt better. i was just go9ing to catch the bus into greshem, and then go somewhere form there. i might have just got on the max, rode it out as far as i could, hitch hiked somehwere and then never call my family again. good parents dont hit their kids and not care if the lay there bleeding in the middle of town.

when they came to pick me up from my grandparents house, they decided to take me shopping as an appoligy. yeah, sure, thats a nice thing to do, but i still hate them for hurting me. i asked my mom if she had any regrets about hitting me, and she said no. she said it made her feel better and she'd do it again if she wanted to. shows how much love exists in that house. . . . 

Ive been trying to call matt, but he's never home, and it seems like whenever i really need to talk with him, he's just never home. hes always somewhere where i can never reach him. i really needed to talk to him yesderday, and his mom said he was gone for the night. how am i going to get a hold of him? its almost like hes running away. I was going to ask him as well if he wanted to go to dinner for my dads birthday today, but i dont know where the fuck he is, so i dont even know if i can get the message to him in time. i hate it when he just dissapears."

"event","im having the worst day of my life. it started at about 10:15 last night, and the shittyness of it just stayed with me all through out the night. god damn it.

well, 10:15 last ngiht:
     My mom comes in and tells matt its time for himt to go home, fine, no big deal. . . so he jumps up, grabs his watch and said, ""well, bye"" and walks out of my room. im like 'wait a minute, no kiss? no hug? no i love you? just goodbye? so, i figure, maybie hes just playing with me, and i hear his keys and the door open and i yell ""MATT!"" and i can hear him laughing, and moms like ""well, arnt you doing to come out here?"" and i was stunned, and so i got up, got my hoodie and then i herd the screen door close. Im like ""no shit. he just left? he didnt even say goodbye. . . . "" so i run out of my house, and i yell ""MATT!"" and he just gets in his car and drives away. Thats when it hit me. he didnt even say goodbye. i stood there for a half an hur crying because hes never done this sort of thing to me. it was rude and assholeish, and he didnt even care. he just wanted to get out of my house. if he wanted to leave that bad, he should have just left. i could sence that he didnt even want to be there earlier that day, like when we where watching american idol, and he was all the way accross the room, and when id look at him he'd just smile and turn back. he didnt want to sit with me. so, i got to that point to where i was so frustrated with myself that i got out of my chair and went into my room and started to cry. of course, when he knows somethings wrong, he comes after me, fakely puts his arms around me and tells me things will be fine. he felt like he didnt want to be holding me. it was fake. i could sence it. He didnt want to be there with me. its a painful realization, but i know thats what it was. it hurts all the more. so, after i cry for that half an hour, and go back inside the house, run to my room, sit on the stool in there and cry a hell of a lot longer. my mom started to yell at me and tell me a was being a winny little girl about it and i should just forget it. It hurt me really bad, and i cant just forget something especially when its killing me. so i take a shower, think about what i shouldnt do (cut myself) sit down in the shower, cry for an hour, get yelled at by my dad who said i needed to go to bed and that im just being stupid for letting this get to me so bad. I go to bed crying, sleep like shit, and wake up tired, pissy, and sad.

so, 7:20ish this morning:
     Im getting dressed, and my father comes to my room and said that we needed to leave soon. okay, fine. i didnt say anything, and he gets mad because im not saying anything. so, i grab my toothbrush, but it in my bag (i'll brush my teeth at school) and go to get my stuff. dad asked me if i had my lunch, and i hadnt made one yet. so, i go into the kitchen to grab my pills and dad gets mad at me for going intot the kitchen because he thinks im going to make my lunch, when im just going to get my pills and he yells at me, and i tell him im just getting my pills and he turns red and starts telling me how stup[id i am and how much he hates me and how i was never supposed to be born. all this over a lunch. so, he trys to give me his, and i dont want it because i dont want to eat today and he yells at me about that and once again stated how stupid i am. I try to defend myself, and he hits me, and i just stand there and then i grab my stuff and get in the car. he yells at me all the way to school, i told him hes being an asshole, and he said ""FUCK YOU STEFANY! FUCK YOU!"" and i start to tear up, but im not going to let myself cry anymore, so i hold it back. my face still hurts, so i hold it. and he tells me im pathetic. we get to school, he tells me not to come home because im not worht his time, and i just leave. ive been holding back everything and i feel like im going to die. i dont know where im going to go. I dont really want to see matt today because he doesnt want to see me (i sence it)and because he was being a jerk last night. god damn it. why do things have to go wrong when things start to get really hectic for me? fucking A.

some one just kill me. i dont need to be alive right now. i just need to be gone."

"event","nothing much happened. my one class got out an hour early :) i had class with tim.  he said some funny things: 

 today in art class, tim said ""i am not a good listener.""

 today in art class, tim said ""i usually don't know what i'm talking about.""

also, some other cool things happened: 

 today in art class, we had popsicles. 

 today in art class, tim said he plays the part of the annoying person to prepare us for those situations. 

yeah, he really said that. he likes to play the role of the annoying, stupid, just out right difficult person because he wants to make us better. somehow i do not believe that. what i think is that it may have started off like that but in all actuality, he forgot what was reality and what was just pretend and just mixes the two all the time.  o tim... in all honesty, i think i'm really going to enjoy his class. 


on a side note... i really wish i wasn't so crazy. i just want to be normal one day."

"event","it occured to me that i have not updated my 'today in art class...' portion of the section for quite some time - and i really need to make up for it. so, here it is some of the highlights of art class awesomeness!! (or at least the ones i can remember): 

today in art class, my professor said something really funny to one of the kids. here, i'll repeat the conversation: 
dan (the student): you know k-dog, i'm not sure if i trust myself with this hammer and chisle. i mean, one false move and i could be dead. chisle through the heart! 
k-dog (the professor): well, it just may be your time to go then. 

today in art class, i made an offering to the kiln gods. 

today in art class, tim made this blood curtling scream. he was really just talking to a hawk in the sky. 

today in art class, i saw a dead bunny. 

today in art class, i made friends with a lonely blue mannequin in the woods. 

today in art class, i performed an ancient african drum and dance ritual honoring anscestors. 

today in art class, i viewed the 2nd largest corporate collection of art work in the nation. 

today in art class, i set my art work on fire. 

today in art class, tim told us something that he just pulled out of his ass. (x 1000). 

today in art class, tim told me he had a new respect for my art work. (which translates to i like you and respect you as a student, i will now start cooperating with you, and i'll get you into any school, gallery, museum, etc. that you want to get into. :) thanks tim!)

today in art class, i was asked to show some of my work with the graduating bfa students. 

today in art class, i met joe dimaggio.

today in art class, i theorized about what direction art is going in the next few decades.  

today in art class, i finally realized what i wanted to do with my life. 

today in art class, i read something HILARIOUS: a good piece of sculpture can roll down the stairs and still be intact. 

today in art class, i learned my new favorite program: illustrator. 


well, that's all i can think of now. there will be more updates.  but don't worry, school is starting soon and guess what!?!? i'm taking 2 studio classes and 1 class with tim! so, the 'today's in art class' will be endless...."

"event","for all 5 of you who actually read this, i'm back and writing! i guess i stopped writing cause of a lack of interest and i was just too busy.  since then, i've been doing great! i survived the second semester of sophomore year (hell yes!!), i stopped swimming, i got fabulous grades, i got my life in order, took a summer class and rocked it, o yeah, and i stayed at school during the summer and had 2 AMAZING jobs! actually that 2 turned into 3. first, i'll explain the jobs: 

my first summer job i got because of my ability to play in photoshop and illustrator for hours on end! i was really a market assistant at the nursing school, but i'd like to think of it as more of a graphic design position. i basically made zillions of posters, collages, photomontages, letterheads, ads, invitation, etc. for the school.  the only thing that sucks about it is i sit at a desk in some god aweful cubical for 9 hours straight, 2-3 days out of the week, and had very little human interaction or sunlight. (and i really hated one of my bosses, but we won't go into that). only thing that kept me going was the fact that i could be creative as i wanted to and the pay was good. 

my second summer job was at the cleveland museum of art!! i was an intern in the distance learning department. i basically wrote dl programs and help edit teacher materials!! it's the best job ever! everyone there is sooo nice and everything we do there is fun! the day centers around our social 2 hour lunch -- 2 hours! (at the nursing school i have to work during lunch just to get paid for that time.)  anyways, working here i've met so many contacts! i already know a good 2/3's of the education department which is fabulous! and one of these contacts is giving me another intership and offered me a job at a high school! i had to turn her down cause i'm already doin too much but it was soo cool! so, instead of quitting and concentrating mostly on my studies this year, i'm going to continue working here at cma in the dl department and i'm gonna get paid for it! paid! that means i'll reached one of my goals: working at a major museum!! eeee!!! 

okay, so my third summer job is assisting this lady write worksheets and other such materials for the local art and design high school! i basically go through and memorize the cma collection and then pick out works that highlight and correspond to the 7 principles of design and other major concepts. sooooo cool! i'm learning so much about art and artists in the process - especailly the little fun facts! i love them! 

so yeah, 3 jobs in 1 summer.  in the fall 5 classes and 2 internships. my ultimate goal is to intern in new york city at a major art museum next summer!!! that would be soo cool, especially at the met! uh - when i'm bored at the nursing school i go online and research internships and grad schools and such. i'll sit there and dream about working in the met -- i'll have this glazed over look on my face for a good 20 minutes before i realize that i'm doing it. but yeah i've decided what i'm gonna do with my life as well!! i'm gonna go to grad school for museum studies at georgetown or nyu.  they both have amazing programs and lots of connections being in such major cities. then i'm gonna go on to work at a top 5 major museum. yup. i know what i want and i'm gonna start getting there now.  

well, that's it for now.  i work at the museum tomorrow, pick my dad up from the airport, and then leave for the cottage on saturday! wow, i really can't express how happy i am now. you think you know, but you have no idea. i've really come a long way since the beginning of last year and i'm really proud of it. :)"

"event","well, today sucked. i skipped swimming cause i just plain didn't feel like getting up and facing the day. it was awful. i seriously haven't been more apathetic in my entire life. hopefully, this mood won't last the whole week. 

while i was researching something in art class, i stumbled upon this site that told me the color of my aura: 

Orange/Amber Aura-
Orange's are very creative and ingenius. They are smart as hell! They are active and enjoy life to the fullest. They mainly live in their own worlds, and aren't very socialble. They like to keep to themselves and are most often loners. They are independent and make great private investigators and national leaders. Orange's, unfortunatly, often have depression problems because they sometimes worry too much on other world-wide problems that they can't solve. 

it also said: 
ORANGE/Amber: sensuality, physical pleasure, emotional self-expression, creativity, lacking reason, lacking self-discipline, health, vitality.

i'd hate to admit this, but that's me right on. 

... 

today in art class i caught snowflakes on my tounge.

today in art class i researched the effects of color on emotion. 

today in art class i took this quiz that said whoa, amber is the color of my energy : )"

"event","so, along with me complaining about how much my life sucks and what i need to do to fix it, i thought i should add a section about something fun i did in art class that day. i want it to be kinda like a joke, to see how ridiculous my statements/days in art class can get. or it can be something cool i did in art class cause we all know how much art class ROCKS!!! so, here are a few to start: 

today in art class i watched a trippy video on the sexual behaivors of the ladybug. 

today in art class i went to a natural history museum and sketched fossils and bones. 

today in art class i played in the snow. 

that was fun : ) thats all for now."

"event","well, it looks as if i have gained about 10 pounds since i came to college. and its kind of depressing. new goal is to lose weight. roughly 10 pounds. ok. so no more sweets as snacks. more water and tea and meat. 

on another note, i really dont hate girls. they just get on my nerves from time to time. 

and for some more randomness, i am doing okay on my 3 goals i set. this weekend was proof of it. i didnt worry about my major problems, until now when i found out i gained weight, i saw many friends this weekend, and i swam well, but didnt let it take over my day. 

lets hope tomorrow goes well."

"event","well, i'm back at school from training trip. and i am not totally broken. :) yay!!! as it turned out, i was able to keep my good attitude for the majority of training trip. what helped was the fact that we only swam 3 hours or less a day and the work outs were doable for the most part. so, because we practiced less than last year, i did not die within the first two days. although by day five, i was pretty bruised and broken. but due to the delay in the broken feeling, i was able to enjoy the people, the weather, and the food!!! (okay, so i didnt go there for the food, but i did pig out on ice cream almost every night!!) training trip this year just felt so different because i was able to enjoy something without remembering that i had practice in a few hours or i could not lift my arm. some of the fun things i did down there was snorkel, sail, lay on the beach, shop, and play in the fountains ;) that was a blast!!! although, towards the end when i couldnt ignore the shoulder pain and my ear started to throb, i did get sick of everything REAL fast. everyone started to get on my nerves, i felt like i was going to pass out in practice, and i just got sick of the sun. i cant believe im saying this but i missed all those overcast days at school. but before i knew it, i was back at school unpacking my luggage and attempting to sort out laundry. 

well, that night i got back, i decided to go home and pack all my other shit i left there and do some laundry. i had dinner with the family and got all my laundry done. everything was going well until bridgie decided that she didnt want to go to school the next day. she told my parents and they said she had to go and then all hell broke loose. she's skipped about 7 days already and she really cant afford to skip anymore. after some major wailing and nashing of teeth, she went to bed and everyone just gave up. the next day, i woke up, went to her room, and there she was. still in bed and it was 10 am. i couldnt help but wonder: what if i wake up someday and she's not there? 

after i was done with everything at home, i went back to school, just in time to make swim practice. it was very tense and i really didnt like the vibe i was getting from anyone. although this bad vibe was mainly coaches fault cause he said we have a double practice on monday. well, this tension lasted all through practice and at one point i almost felt like getting out of the pool and quitting. i didnt though. and what made that practice worse was the water temperature. it felt like it was below freezing!! i did not warm up at all and torwards the end i swore i was going to get hypothermia because my feet started to turn purple. the only benefit of this freezing cold water was that since i didnt warm up at all, my body did not over heat. so i could go as fast as i wanted to and i only stopped going faster because my shoulders were hurting. i really did go some really fast splits for practice :)

the next day we had a meet at the pool with the absolute worst temperature ever!! the pool itself was freezing as usual but the warm up pool was like bath water. this is terrible for swimmers cause once you warm up in the warmer pool, you then dive in the cold pool and all your muscles tense up! and that wasnt the worst part of it either! i did not get a good stretch in, warm up, or cool down for each event and to top it all off, i went faster in my 100 yd splits that i was doing last night than i did at the meet!!!! that was so frusterating! i just could not make my stiff muscles loose! ugh!! im just glad its over with. but that also brings up another point: i felt like that meet was another meet that i waisted cause i didnt swim well. i probably only have 4 more weeks in my swimming career and i blew another meet to a bunch of lame excuses. go me. 

and that brings me to today. today was my first day off from swimming and it felt GREAT! i woke up, showered, pampered myself with loads of lotion, and put on make up! for the first time in 15 days, i looked normal!! :) today was lots of fun, i finished unpacking saw lots of friends and shared lots of love! it feels good to be back. but i have school in 1 day. and thats depressing. but i've done an good job of staying focused and not worrying so much. lets hope it lasts into school. well, goodnight."

"event","well, this is my last night at home for a long time. i've got some bitter sweet feelings about it. more bitter and less sweet. the parents and delaney are back from their trip to see grandma and the family which is kinda of annoying because there is now someone to yell at bridgie and i for being a bunch of lazy asses all day. but, i'm glad to get the change of scenery. 

florida will be much nicer than here, but what i'm doing in florida will suck some major ass. i'm not ready to kill myself in the pool just yet... or ever. i really feel that i have grown out of this swimming thing. i haven't peaked, i've just gotten bored with it. o well. only 2 more months and then i am done. i think i am coming down with something, a cold or what not. lets just hope i get over it before florida and it doesn't turn into last years training trip illness, which was a cold that turned into a sinus/ear infection and i was miserable for most of the trip. if this sickness doesnt worsen, i want to try and enjoy training trip this time. and that reminds me... i still need to pack! ugh!! all these thoughts of training trip are starting to overwhelm me.

during this coming month, i hope i can keep the same upbeat attitude i have had throughout my winter break. its been nice always having someone there to laugh with and help me forget about all my problems and the rest of the world. lets hope i can always find someone to do this with. that shouldn't be too hard right? i mean, who doesn't like a good laugh every once in a while? 

okay, it is time for bed. i am really starting to feel this cold. drowsy is not a good feeling at all. and not a good feeling to start training trip with. oh geeze... 

well, i'll see y'all later!!"

"event","well, that was exhilarating. i just saw happy feet with bridgie and her friend. it was really about humans destroying the earth but with a ""happy"" twist. lol. yeah i definately had more fun making fun of the movie and making wise cracks at it than actually watching the movie. i now have the giggles from all that laughing and silliness, so i probably won't sleep anytime soon. o well.

on another note, but still the same theme, i did something super blonde this week. to start the story off, let me just say that i should not be allowed to drive because i 1) suck at it as seen through the numerous times i have run into things or should have recieved a ticket and 2) view the rules of the road as guidelines that you 'should' follow rather than rules you need to stick with. so back to the story, i had taken bridgie to a friends house so she could walk the dog and let it out so it could take a crap and we were getting back in the car and ready to leave. well, it was late at night so i thought i pushed the lights on and then proceed on with putting the car in gear. even though we were driving through woods, i noticed it was a lot darker than normal. i said to bridgie, ""wow, i have really bad night vision."" she then looks at me, then the road, then at my control pannel and yells, ""DO YOU EVEN HAVE YOUR LIGHTS ON?"" i then said, ""o god. no. oops!"" then turned them as bridgie yelled random obscenities at me and i laughed my ass off. i did not stop laughing for a good twenty minutes and got quite the ab work out as a result. i love these types of times with bridgie. she's so fun! i can just say anything and we laugh about it. there are times where we will talk and laugh for hours on end about mindless, stupid things. good times :D"

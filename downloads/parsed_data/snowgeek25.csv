I just received an e-mail from Mrs. Smith, the BHS National Honors Society overseer. In this e-mail, Mrs. Smith sent an attachment about wearing red on Fridays for those who ""support our troops."" 

An incerpt [I bolded the particularly offensive parts]:
<i>RED FRIDAYS ----- Very soon, you will see a great many people wearing Red
every Friday. The reason? <b>Americans who support our troops used to be called
the ""silent majority"".</b> We are no longer silent, and are voicing our love for
God, country, and home in record breaking numbers.  We are not organized,
boisterous, or over-bearing. We get no liberal media coverage on TV to
reflect our message or our opinions.</i>

So basically, you wear red on Fridays if you support the war. 

<i>We'll have to publicize it beginning the first day of school which is a Wednesday, and we'll have to remind staff and students every week, but it seems to me something relatively easy to do and worth our time.  So let me know what you think.  You could also pass the info along to everyone you know (kids and adults) and maybe get it started this summer.  <b>We have a publicity committee who can take this on right away at the beginning of school.</b> </i>

...Yeah. I'm head of the publicity committee.
So if the rest of the kids decide they want to do this, I'm either going to have to forfeit my duties or I'm going to have to go against my morals. 

This just feels wrong."

So driving on 84 East to Mark's house, the weather turned really bad; I was a little scared at some points but it was alright for the most part. 
Except 15 minutes away from Mark's exit, a huge truck flipped over 7 or 8 cars ahead of me. 
Im not sure what happened, but the cars in front of me pulled off to the side to avoid hitting/getting hit by flying truck-stuff, so I did too.

I sat there for a few minutes shaking like crazy; I called Mark to let him know what happened. He sounded really concerned and made sure I was OK. After that I called my mom, who basically didn't seem to care haha. About 30 seconds after I took those pictures, traffic was jamming up like crazy. Some guy let me in a few minutes later; I passed the first few cars ahead of me to find the first two or three cars COMPLETELY smashed. The people were out and walking around so it didn't seem like anyone got hurt, but the cars were definitely totalled.

I'm just SO GLAD it wasn't me, and that I got out not only quickly but safely.
Thank you, there IS a God."

I made a little schedule with Rachel and Alex today in French... so far it's gonna be us 3 and Kate doing nails Friday afternoon, and Rach and I are gonna get our hair done. If anyone else wants to join us, feel free! 
I <i>think</i> I'm going to Juliet's house for pictures? I heard about it from Alex today in French sooo I'm not sure what's going on with that... and I have no idea what's going on with after-prom activities. Soooo someone should clue me in :) I'm confused, I know about Tori's party [which I wasn't really invited to...] and I know that Jenny and Kathryn and Rach are going bowling after, and someone or other was having a sleepover and... oy. So yeah does anyone have details??


SkaProm, which will most likely be in Hamden now, is going to be amazing. 
BROOKFIELD KIDS WHO ARE GOING TO SKAPROM:
If you need a ride, tell me ASAP so I can save a space in my car. I already promised Kate and Alex that I'd take them, and I might be taking Juliet, so that leaves one spot open.
I also know Rini was planning on going to SkaProm, as was Maddy I believe? 
We really need to work stuff out. 
If anyone else in the Brookfield area is DRIVING to SkaProm, PLEASE let me know so we can arrange carpools. I don't mind taking people in my car, but I don't want everyone to get supercrowded... :-/

I had a bit of an incident yesterday. On the way home from school, in the peak of the snowstorm, I skidded as I was turning a corner between the intersection near 133 and the graffiti bridge. I was about to skid right into an SUV so I turned the other way and drove myself a few yards off the road and right into a huge brush. 
Scariest three seconds of my life. 
I was a bit panicked at first, but collected myself in a few minutes, called my mom and Derek. Some plowman guy helped break away some of the brush (it was pressed up against my car door and I couldn't get out) and called the cops for me. Waited around for an hour or so, the cop came, had a wrecker come and pull me out. My mom also came; she was more distressed than I was. After pulling out my car, there were no scratches visible or anything; the only thing that looked bad was something plastic fell out from underneath. Took my car to Lang's; picked it up today-- the plastic thing was the only thing wrong. And they said I didn't have to replace it right away. So all in all I only had to pay $75 for the towing; I might get reimbursed for it by AAA, or so my mother says. 

My dad's not taking the car. It's not going on the insurance or anything. The only restriction I have, is I can't drive to see Derek tomorrow. But that's fine, cuz his dad is picking me up. 

I think that this was actually kind of good for me. I was starting to think and feel as though I was invincible behind the wheel. Boy, was I wrong. 
Even when I'm going under the speed limit... I manage to screw things up. 



The silver lining: At least I didn't hit the governor."

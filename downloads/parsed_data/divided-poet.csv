"event","So, time for another rant. This one involves the hood of my car flying up and busting my windshield while I was driving and my 'best' friends complete disregard.

<lj-cut text=""Here we go..."">
So, this weekend I was gonna drive to Houston from Denton (about 3 1/2-4 hours). I was gonna drive to Houston, work from open to close at my job both Saturday and Sunday. And, while not working, I was gonna have lots and lots of sex with the coworker (Kyle) that I've been dating for about a month and haven't seen in the last two weeks.

I hadn't told my mom I was coming home. I was gonna go stay at Kyle's the whole weekend, sex and work, those were my planes. My friend Elle called me Tuesday night and asked if I wanted to go out Friday night with her and some friends to go dancing in Houston. Well, I would have been driving for the last 4 hours and I would have had to be at work by 7:50 the next morning and...partying with Elle can be kind of intense. Normally, that's totally cool. But, I was looking forward to pulling into the parking lot of Kyle's apartment, going inside, and chilling out (subtext = SEX). So, I called Elle Wednesday and I was like, ""Okay, I'm gonna be totally girly, but I kinda wanna be all domestic on Friday. Do you hate me?"" and she (not sounding super happy) was like, ""You're not gonna party with me? No, I don't hate you, I just think you're gonna be kind of disappointed. But, ya know, call me if you change your mind."" So, I was like yeah. Then I sent her this text later that was like, ""Ya know, I have plans in my head for Friday but his might not be the same. So I'm gonna call him, and if his plans don't involve lots o' sex, I'm gonna party."" She never responded and I talked to him and we decided to still stay in. I didn't really think anything about it, and she texted me a question last night that I responded to so I figured all was fine.

So, today, I rush through my whole day so I can leave by like 3 and get to the boys apartment between 6 and 7...to start the sex, ya know.

Then, after getting everything done that I needed to; I pack up my car, jump in, put gas in it, and start heading toward H-Town. As I hit Lewisville...the hood of my car flies up and smashes into my windshield!

So, I'm in the middle lane and I quickly move over to the shoulder, thankfully there was no one around me. I get out of my car, carefully, before I start cursing and screaming. It takes me a second to figure out who to call. So, not necessarily in this order ('cause I don't really remember), I called my work, AAA, and my mechanic because they'd been the last people under my hood the night before so it was most likely their fault.

A cop pulled up behind me to chill out while I waited for a tow truck, which made me a tad nervous even though I had nothing to be nervous about. heh

So, while I'm sitting there waiting I text two people: My roommate Elizabeth and my best friend Elle. I'd called Elle first, but it had rung three times before cutting to voicemail.

Elizabeth's response: Omg! Are you okay?! Do you need anything from me.

Elle's response: Call Kyle, I guess.

Um...okay. At first I'm just kind of like, what? Then, I text her and I'm like, ""No, I mean, yeah I'll tell him but I was kinda freaked out. Sorry to bother you.""

She never texted me back and I was only mostly annoyed by it. But, I went on. Had my car towed, talked to my mechanics (where they were all like, yeah, we'll figure it out. Call ya tomorrow. Here's a ride home), called the boy and talked for like an hour about how bummed out we both are that I wasn't gonna be heading back and how he missed me (and since we're not actually in a relationship and just fucking around, that was nice to hear), and settled in with a sandwich.

Later, after my roommate gets home, we're talking about what happened and I bring up the Elle thing again and she says she thinks that's really shit. I'd just been mostly annoyed before, but now I'm like pissed off. Then, my roommate points out that Elle probably thought I was in Houston already and how that makes it even worse.

Suddenly, I'm not just pissed off, but I'm hurt. Like, I could have been seriously fucked up. She knew I wasn't telling my mom I was coming home, and she knew I'd had plans for a while to stay with Kyle. I wasn't that chick blowing her off to hang out with a boy, these had been my plans. 

I just, shit, she's my best friend, right? And even if I was pissed beyond belief at her for doing some...okay, if she called me tomorrow and said she needed a ride to Houston and she was stranded or whatever, even after she'd been a shit to me, I would still drive where ever she was because that's what you do for your good friends.

And, I wasn't even asking her to pick me up. I don't do that. I take care of my own shit and I don't rely on other people. I just wanted to fucking talk to her, my friend who is supposed to be there for me. If she was in school I'd get that, if she was at work or, shit, was doing anything, really I do understand, but she didn't give a shit.

Fuck, I could have been dying on the side of the fucking road and all she said to me was, ""Call Kyle, I guess.""

I just...I'm fucking hurt and pissed off.</lj-cut>

That was my rant. [/Rant]"

"event","SO, I've been trying to write more...again. But, as an interlude to my writing, I figured I'd post some life stuff. Just...'cause. heh So, feel free to ignore, the real life stuff will be under the cut.

<lj-cut text=""My RL..."">
Sooooo, last semester was hard. Like, super hard. Like, my worst semester ever. I was driving 8 hours every weekend and it was making school super tough. I was really unhappy, and really lonely. The lonely thing was weird 'cause...I mean, I was around people all the time but...I don't know, I was just lonely.

While I was driving home every weekend, I was working. At work I wasn't really paying attention to much of anything. I didn't know what drama was going on, I didn't know what was going down behind the scenes. So, one weekend I found out that the one guy at work that I could see myself hooking up with, the married one, had been getting a divorce for the last month. I slept with him that night. That's where it started, that's when I started sleeping with the head therapist at work. 

We went out on a real date the Saturday after Christmas and...shit, I had a good time. Which...I don't date guys. I sleep with them, and then I go away. That's my MO. And, I guess it's a little hard because I work with him but still... Anyway, we went to see a movie. Then, we got food. Then, we went back to my empty house and had us some fun. All of this was nice, all of this made me really happy. And, that right there is how it's been for the last month or so. We go out, we hang out at one of our places, we have sex. 

It freaks me out. I'm not used to liking people like that...really liking them. 

Then, one night after we'd gone to see a movie and grabbed some dinner, we're at his apartment talking about something. Then we're kissing, then we're moving into his room. We kissing standing at the edge of his bed when...he hugs me. Like, he'd had a hand on my waste and a hand on my neck and he moved them around me. I kinda froze for a minute, surprised. But then I tentatively hugged him back. We stood like that for a minute or two. 

We pulled apart, and I think we just started kissing again, I don't know it's kind of fuzzy. Anyway, so we're laying on the bed making out and he lays back for a minute and just starts staring at the ceiling. Well, I know something was off after the hug so I'm just laying there watching him. As I'm watching I see his eyes started to go glassy. Shit, I was freaking out in my head. We talked a lot that night. He told me about his brother, and cheating on his wife, and all of this shit. And, I mean, I reacted correctly I know 'cause I'm good at that, but in my head I was flipping out.

We talked, we joked, he relaxed a little, we had sex. It was an interesting night. As we left, him going to work and me heading home, he asked me to call him later. I suddenly felt like the guy, it was odd.

We proceeded to spend the night with each other every night that week. Like, he stayed at my house that night and the next today we hung out until like 1:30pm. It...I like him. Shit. I fucking like him. Fuck me. 

Then, Friday comes and I see him at work after seeing him that morning and I'm like, ""Wanna hang out tonight?"" (which, he'd said the morning that I should give him a call later if I wanted to hang out that night) to which he replies, ""I don't know. I'm kind of in a funky place today. But, why don't you give me a call when you get off (I get off like 5 hours after him)."" SO, I thought about that for like an hour while I was giving a massage. Then, I saw him in the break room later and I was like, ""Look, you do seem kind of funky today and we have been spending a lot of time together, and I really don't wanna deal with pushing that. So, I get off at ten. Why don't you just give me a call later if you wanna hang out and if not I'll see you in two weeks (Because, I was leaving for school Sunday and it was Friday and he was doing this Expo thing Saturday so I wouldn't see him at work)."" He said that was probably what would happen 'cause he had to be up early the next morning, but he was still fine with me crashing at his place the weekend I came back into town (which I'd asked him about beforehand). 

I just...it felt off. I don't know. I didn't see him that night, I wasn't supposed to see him the next day but he happened to show up at work (while I was going on my break) to drop some stuff up and pick up his car (which is really just my luck). We talked a bit, but not much. Then, when I went to leave town the next day I realized I hadn't filled out my direct deposit form so I needed to go by work and do that. He was standing in the office when I got there, of course. I started filling it out in the office. They asked if I could fill it out in the back so they could do some work. When I headed to the back he followed me. I filled it out, him and I bantered, there was someone in the break room so we didn't really talk. I stood up to head to the front, he followed me. He did something in one of the closets at work, I followed him. Then, he pulled me into his massage room and gave me a kiss. It was sweet and nice. He then patted me on the lower back when I turned and was like, get out of here.

I felt better after that kiss, but now I'm like fucking worried he's gonna forget about me. It's stupid, but...I don't know. Gah, I feel like such a girl. 

He has said he's gonna try to head up with my friend to come to my birthday party, which is nice since I live 4 hours away. I'm just...I don't know, I like him. *sigh*</lj-cut>

Yeah, that's the most notable change in my life recently. heh"

"event","Okay, so I decided that I was gonna tell this kid I couldn't date him.  The truth of the matter is I don't find him that attractive, he can creep me out sometimes, and he's offended me more than once (ex: ""You're practically perfect.  I mean, you're a little chubby, but other than that..."").  I just don't wanna date this kid.  Also, kind of a drama queen (ex: ""I'm here if you need me.  But nobody ever does, so..."").  But, instead of telling him all that, I send him this instead:

<lj-cut text=""The Texts...""><i>""A couple months ago I got my heart broken pretty hardcore by this kid at school. And, I know it was a bit ago, and dating should make it go away...But I haven't dated anyone since and Saturday made me realize that I'm just not ready.  I'm really sorry. :( I didn't mean to do this I promise, I just can't. :(""</i>

I know I prayed on the Blake thing hardcore, maybe a little more so than I felt it.  The truth of the matter is I probably would be fine dating again, just not this kid.

His response to my text:

<i>""I understand Courtney.  My wife to be left me three years ago </i>(This kid's 20, btw)<i> and I've just now started dating again, but dating someone new is a part of the healing process believe it or not.  I promise not to hurt you Courtney, you're a wonderful girl and I couldn't be so lucky.  If you're willing to give me a chance, I'm willing to fight with all my might to make it work.  It's your final decision though and I have to respect what ever you decide.  I want to be urs </i>(yes, ""urs"")<i>.""</i>

My response:

<i>""You're sweet, you really are.  But something you have to know, I'm not worried about you hurting me.  It takes a lot to do that, so you gotta know this kid put me through the ringer.  But he messages me sometimes, and I want him to and he still makes me smile.  And, I know I'm gonna want all of that from him for a while.  I can't do that to someone else.  Because I know that for a while at least anytime this kid contacts me, he's all I'll see.""</i>

Which is kinda of true, but that's only cause I haven't found anyone yet that interests me more than Blake does. *shrug*

His reply (at which point I really wanna hit him):

<i>""That's probably why you're still in pain.  If you didn't know still being in contact with your exes stops the healing process altogether.  I know from first hand experience and I've also read about it online.  While it breaks my heart that you don't wanna date me it's nothing I haven't already endured.  I want you to be happy and if that's what you want, so be it.  Are you absolutely sure though?  If nothing else, lemme help you heal.""</i>

I said no, but in nicer terms, I don't really remember.  His reply to that was:

<i>""I understand, because I'm going through the same thing.  Albeit a different person for different reasons.  I'm sorry I don't live up to this other guy.""</i></lj-cut>

DRAMA QUEEN.  Hardcore drama queen that can't take no for an answer, I swear.

Then he said all this stuff about how <i>if you wanna love again you have to let someone in.</i>  Then he said he'll <i>always be here if I ever need him but no one ever does so...</i>  To which I responded, <i>""Honey, fuck that drama shit.""</i>  He said he was <i>sorry, just a little depressed, but he was being honest.</i>  This all culminated in him trying to talk about something else and me saying a needed to sleep.

Everything seemed to end fairly well considering.  Except, I got this this morning:

<lj-cut text=""The E-mail...""><i>""I just wanted to send ya an email, telling you how I really felt since
txting isn't  that great at conveying what I wanna say.
I'm sorry if I made you angry or offended you in anyway, I just don't
handle rejection too well.

Anyway, im not angry or anything but I wanted you to know what I
really think of you.

From the day I met you I thought you had to be to good to be true;
your smart, witty, humble, sweet, and have every other desirable trait
I want in a woman. On top of that your pretty. I mean you really are
the total package; Aleast you are in my eyes. I really like you, and
i'd like to be yours if you'll have me. I mean serious dating though;
bf/gf typa thing. I know you've got a broken heart but im more than
willing to help you heal, maybe even love again.

I mean if you'll give me a second chance that is. I'm all about second
chances too ya know?

Courtney, I know your not perfect but your damn close, and that kinda
intimidates me since I've never known a girl like you before. I know
the first date wasn't that great, I promise the second will be ten
times better, if there is a second. I'm not going anywhere, so when
ever your ready, or if you atleast wanna talk about it; call me. don't
txt. we'll hash it out. I hope to hear from you.""</i></lj-cut>

I DON'T wanna date this kid.  I tried being nice, I tried saying there was someone else.  I mean, the deal is, I'd go out with him and be like whatever if he lived closer.  That's one of the main things.  I don't feel like putting that much effort into a relationship with someone I don't really like.  This kid reminds me of my ex (Jesse), and I was with him for a couple months...but he lived 5 minutes down the road.  It was easy, I never had to drive anywhere, and I had nothing better to do.  That sounds mean, I know, but I'm 20 fucking years old.  I refuse to be completely serious about my relationships.  Blake is a fluke, I know that much.  With other guys I'm just kind of like whatever most of the time.  It doesn't help that he annoys the shit out of me and whines like a dramatic baby.  I've had enough of that, I lived with it for the last 5 months, not to mention shit at him.  Relationships should be easy when that start out.  <b>Fuck this drama shit.</b>"

I went on a date tonight to see Transformers, right?  The movie was good, me and the guy didn't talk much so that was whatever.  The kid actually drove an hour in my direction to see me after I got off work, so that was sweet.  

You know what made it a bad date though?  I didn't actually meet the woman, but his mom had come with him.  And, as I told him I needed to go home and sleep he said, ""Yeah, they probably went somewhere to eat.""  The kid brought his family on our date, I swear.  That's weird.  

I didn't see any of them, but it's still weird.  And, what mother does that to her kid?  What mother goes on her kid's date?  He's twenty years old!  So I ask again, where do I find these guys?"

The one where things are nice after the sex, too?  Not awkward and strange, but just nice and...just...there.

I'm not even looking for a boyfriend, just someone to fuck on and off and maybe enjoy spending a little time with after the fucking before going about our days.

To which I respond, something's always wrong it just depends on how you feel about its wrong-ness.  The I wait...and he said nothing.  So I said, ...in terms of how most people handle therapy, I mean.  Still, nothing.  So, I go, Psychiatrist say anything interesting?  And you know what, he hasn't said anything.  I just, why fucking bother messaging me?  Just to drive me crazy?  Really?  I fucking...Ah!"

"event","I was gonna be okay.  I wasn't thinking about Blake at all really because I'd developed this little crush on my friend's cousin.  It was a crush that wasn't gonna go anywhere because the cousin lives a few states away and has been with the same chick for 4 years.  But, I recognized it for what it was, a distraction that worked wonders.

<lj-cut text=""Then I got a message in my inbox on facebook:"">

<b>In my Inbox on facebook:</b>

<b>Blake:</b> so, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for everything I did to you. It was all pretty sheisty, and I feel bad about it. You probably won't forgive me, and probably still hate me, but still, sorry.
 
Then this all happened:

It was pretty...sheisty, and it hurt. You really fucked with me. But it means something to me that you're apologizing, so thank you.

I should have just stopped responding after I said my little piece.  The problem is, I want this kid to try soooo badly.  Unfortunately, what this did was get rid of the majority of my little crush on the cousin and bring me right back to thinking about this kid all the time.  If he'd just left me alone, I would have been fine.  I would have gotten completely over him and I would have been fine.  And, the apology would have been amazing if he didn't make me think for just a few days that he was actually going to try.  Now, I over analyze these messages.  I wonder if he's being sarcastic or sincere, if he actually feels that sorry or if he feels like I took it too far.  It's driving me crazy.

At least my T-Spoke still applies.  ""We've been here before.""  There was never a truer statement that applied to my life."

I was a fucking incredible kid, I was a fucking saint, but apparently I'll never change.  Apparently I've just been way too horrible for way too long and I'll never change.  I stay out getting her shit so she won't be nauseous and she won't let me go to Denny's the next night.  When I tell her, when I say I want her to know that I didn't just stay out for nothing the night before, that it was for her, she flips the fuck out.  

I get why she's mad, I get she's sick, I get that I'm probably a little shit, but they have been so fucked up for so long and I'm so tired and nothing feels any different.  I don't know how to be the saintly daughter that does everything she asks, even though she's sick.  I don't know how to do that, because she asks fucking crazy shit, because she expects one fucking thing of me and so regardless of anything else I do, that's the outcome she's going to assume she's gonna get.

She's sick, and I'm so fucking scared, and I feel so guilty for getting mad at her about anything, and I'm so bottled up, and she gets to scream and through temper tantrums and I'm stuck.  I can't even fucking go to Denny's when I need a break.

And Jesus Christ, him. I am as fucked up as I am because of him.  So, maybe he's not a junkie anymore, maybe he just has blood sugar problems now.  Here's the thing though, you don't deal with your mom at 15 calling the cops on your dad cause he's trying to break into the house again because he's fucked up and she threw him out, and then 16 and then 17 and then 18, without coming out a little fucked up, without finishing with no respect for the man.

I'm a horrible kid now, I get that, my mom is sick and I'm not just doing everything she asks.  But, God, even before this, they didn't get it.  Look what the fuck they did to me.  I fuck nice guys once and I get bored and I stop returning their calls, and the one guy that I've every really fallen for is horrifically fucked up and treated me like shit.  I cut myself for years, and when my mom found out she made me feel like I was disgusting.  I haven't cut myself in a while.  Not because I don't think it would help, no, because I know if she sees she'll do what she did before.

That's the price of being their daughter, so I guess she's right, I guess I'm never gonna change."

"event","Okay, so it's finals week.  I have two left: English and my Russian oral exam.  Can I just say, good-fucking-bye to the worst semester of college I've had yet.  The day to day wasn't bad at all, I love my friends and I had lots of fun, but lets recap the larger events of this semester:

1. The first boy a managed to fall in love with finally fucked me and broke my heart after screwing with me for 3 months right before he got a girlfriend.

2. My new roommate, who I loved and got along with great, suddenly decided she hated talking to me and was now gonna be a hurtful bitch.

3. The doctors found a mass in my moms colon, are now sure that she has cancer, she is starting radiation and chemo, and may have to have a hysterectomy.

4. My dad once again is showing signs of crazy and/or drug abuse.

5. One of my already good friends decided they liked my roommate more than me and decided to tell me they hoped I had someone else to talk to about my problems 'cause they couldn't handle it and felt like they couldn't relate to me anymore.

I'm really not a whiner, I promise.  I mean, this is my blog-y thing and I bitch on here quite a bit, but day to day I am not a whiny person.  But, shit.

I had some great time, I really did, but here's to the end of drama and bullshit...at least hopefully.

In other news, my friend Elizabeth and I signed a lease for a house (technically, we signed a piece of paper and put down $600, but whatever) and are able to move in August 1st.

I love Bruce, but fuck this roommate shit.

Also, funny story:
<lj-cut text=""Of ducktaped refrigerators..."">
So, I'm studying one day with my newish amazing friend Laurie (just started hanging out with her this semester and she graduates on SATURDAY! Friend-finding-fail!) and she gets a call from her mom.  They start discussing the logistics of how they're getting all of her shit out of her dorm room and back to her home about 4 hours away.  She looks up and says, ""Hey, want a 'fridge?""  Of course, I'm like, yes, 'cause worst comes to worst I'll sell that bitch on craigslist.  

Anyway, that's not the amusing part.  The amusing part is, we had to get this decent sized dorm room 'fridge from Honors Hall, at one end of the campus, to Bruce Hall, at the other.  So, we decided to move this sizable object at midnight last night.  We drove Laurie's car and parking it in the pick-up lane at Honors.  We then went upstairs, ran into a few friends and told them what we were attempting, before we continued on to Laurie's room.  Once there, we decide to take the cushioned part off of an Honors Hall rolling chair and set the fridge on the stool underneath.  Then, to secure said fridge, we wrap ducktape around the entire thing.  Then, we roll this fridge/stool combination down the hall, past our friends who ask us if we're drunk to which we honestly reply no, and onto the elevator.  

Now, I figure we're going to throw this bitch in Laurie's car and drive it over to Bruce.  Oh no, we roll that sucker all the way from her dorm to mine, kicking the legs of the rolling chair when they get stuck on cracks.  

The last amusing thing was the fact that, we were wheeling a refrigerator ducktaped to a rolling chair through two lobbies, and almost nobody blinked an eye.  I'm sure we looked plastered, and we laughed the whole way.  I cannot describe how amusing this story is to me.  For some reason it feels like a true college experience story, and I'm glad I had it.</lj-cut>"

"event","So, last night was interesting.  My friend Grant had this Birthday Party/Roast (you know, comedy central style).  There was also a cheese, wine, and beer tasting...which is funny, cause this was a twentieth birthday party.  But, it was quite tasty.    The roast was funny...except most of us knew this would happen. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Lots O' Drama Under the Cut"">Okay, so, with any friend, you know there are those off limits topics. My friend Grant's off limits topic is his ex-gf. They were together for 3 years, plus one year of fighting, and he recently found out that she cheated on him when they were together. This chick put him through lots of shit...repeatedly. He let her, which is a whole 'nother story. So, a few people have roasts, funny stuff that he was expecting. Then, our friend Hitch comes up. And he doesn't use the ex's names, but he does comment on it and basically talks about her directly without talking about her directly...if that makes sense. He took it fine, there were yells of, &quot;He&nbsp;<i>just</i>&nbsp;went there!&quot; There was laughing and the whole party was doing that, &quot;Oh!&quot; think that people do when the see someone get...served. (hehe) Everyone else took there turns, then Grant took his getting us back. But he was off. The myriad of insults it would be very easy to through at us just weren't there. They were there enough, but it basically just looked like he was drunk and his brain was working slowly. When that ended, there was laughing and talking and Grant had disappeared.&nbsp;<br /><br />Soon, we noticed that our friend Rachel had disappeared. Then, Helen. So, we go look in one of the bedrooms in the apartment, and there all laying on a bed. There's more laughing, and people trying to keep people out of the bedroom in that laughing, &quot;haha I'm leaning against the door,&quot; way. Get in there, there are about 4 people laying on the bed now (Me, Grant, Rachel, and this guy Austin) and someone says something or Grant says something about Hitch's roast bit and Grant's like, &quot;Four fucking years!&quot; and then he starts ranting (and suddenly Austin understands what we'd been talking about when we'd warned him about drunk-ish Grant and the dreaded ex). He starts going on about her, which is fine, and we all talk and try to console and joke. We finally move from the bed we're on to Helen's (cause the owner of the bed we were on wasn't even there at the party). Everything seems to get better.&nbsp;<br /><br />There was more drinking, some sitting on Helen's bed, laughing. The party went through different forms of this for the rest of the night. I only did one shot (with Austin) I'm proud to say...but that could be because we were out of vodka. I did however drink many imported beers and wines. :D It was lovely. At some point, as many people have left, and the party is winding down, Rachel, Austin, and I are standing talking. We're talking about ranting about ex's and if we wanna go and...some other shit that kind of blur together cause I was pretty gone. Rachel mentions Kristin (who is in the other room saying she wants to sleep in her own bed tonight) and she asks if I'm staying there after Austin has offered to walk her home (she lives across campus and it's now like 3:30am). I say that I don't know, I'd like to go home but I don't wanna walk with Kristin. And Austin's like, &quot;Again, Bruce is right on my way, I can walk you home too, it's not a problem.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;I really don't wanna walk back with Kristin.&quot; And Austin's like, &quot;You wanna go, you guys wanna go?&quot; And me and Rachel do that girl thing where we look at each other like we don't really wanna decide but we do...thing, ya know? Anyway, Austin's like, &quot;Okay, lets go. Lemme get my jacket.&quot; So, we go, get all our shit (which is in the room where Grant, Kristin, and Helen are), and we're like, &quot;We're gonna leave.&quot; And, of course, Grant and Kristin are like, yeah we're gonna go too. So, it looks like we're all walking back together.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, we're waiting to leave...or whatever. And, I don't know what Kristin does or says or if she even did anything and maybe I just looked at her and thought of it, but I go over to Rachel where she is by the door and I kinda start crying and I'm like, &quot;I don't know what I did. I don't understand. She's so mean to me, and I don't get it.&quot; And, Rachel looks around a little and pulls me outside. I start crying harder and she kinda looks like she doesn't know what to do, but she's also saying things like, &quot;You didn't do anything wrong. She has her own stuff. There's nothing you could do. She has to fix herself, she just takes it out on you.&quot; Austin comes out for a second (I guess cause we were gonna leave just before this happened, and he was gonna walk me and Rachel, and we just disappeared outside) and he's see us (me all cry-y) and is like, &quot;Um, yeah, I'm just gonna go back inside.&quot; I do this some more, say some more of the same stuff, and I'm like, &quot;I don't wanna walk back with her, I don't,&quot; I think I keep saying that over and over again at this point. Rachel's like, &quot;Okay, we need to leave, let's just leave.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />Then she goes in the door and grabs Austin and we go. And Austin's like, &quot;Hey, okay, what's up? Are you okay?&quot; Yeah know, me all teary and sniffling and shit...oh, and drunk (ish at this point) lets not forget I'm now the crying drunk girl. So I'm like, &quot;You really wanna know?&quot; And he's like, &quot;I don't mind hearing at all.&quot; (This is all with one arm around Rachel's shoulder and my other arm linked through Austin's, btw) So I'm just like, &quot;Kristin and I are roommates, and she kinda talks to me like I'm a dumb ass and always disagrees with what I say, and is basically pretty mean to me.&quot; I think that's the gist of what I said. I just remember the roommates part, and dumb-ass part, and that my explanation was very short and concise. And he's all apologetic-y and nice, and we've now made it like half a block from Helen's and we've been hearing Grant and Kristin call and tell us to wait up, and like amazing people Rachel and Austin just kept walking with me. &nbsp;So, finally I stop being a bitch and I'm like, &quot;Wait, we should wait for them.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />Rachel says that Kristin probably heard me. But you know what, I said nothing mean about her and I was obviously very upset. If this upset her enough to get angry at me, then she really isn't a very good person.&nbsp;<br /><br />And you know what else, Kristin had a panic attack at my birthday dinner 'cause she felt like she was being ignore, and Helen had a panic attack at her roommates birthday party cause there were too many people in her apartment, so I think I'm entitled to a very quiet cry that took place mostly outside and involved much fewer people then either of their's did. If that makes me a bad person, whatever.&nbsp;<br /><br />So we wait, and when they're right behind us we all start walking again, Rachel, Austin, and I still in the same line we were in before. We all get back to Bruce, hang in Kristin and I's room for a bit, Austin plays Rachel a song on my guitar (not in the 'I'm playing you a song' standard way, of course, 'cause Austin has a girlfriend *insert sarcasm here* *eye roll at the thought that he&nbsp;<i>wasn't</i>&nbsp;hitting on her, even though he has a gf*) and Grant opens his b-day present from me. I hope he liked it, I got him a copy of Diary. They all leave to head back to their respective dorms (Grant and Austin walking Rachel back to hers before heading to the dorm they both live in) and Kristin and I don't talk...which actually isn't too weird. We go to sleep.&nbsp;<br /><br />This morning, Kristin left to go to Helen's (I'm pretty sure) and I think she was meeting Grant there. She didn't say a word to me before she left and she still makes me wanna cry just when I think about it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here's the thing, I don't actually fault Kristin for hanging out with people, the&nbsp;<i>only</i>&nbsp;people she knows here. I guess I'm upset at my friends a little for deciding, seemingly, that they'd just rather hang out with her. It makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong, and I don't know how to fix it. It's like, everyone prefers her over me, and they all say how nice and sweet she is. And, I don't think it would bother me so much if she were actually those things towards me.&nbsp;<br /><br />I just, I always say thank you and I ask how she is and I try sooo hard not to let how she treats me effect how I would act toward any human being, regardless of how they act towards me. The only thing she ever asks me is, &quot;Do you mind if I turn the overhead light on?&quot; That's seriously it. The myriad of things she does that are hurtful or rude, and she chooses the light.<br /><br />But, with my friends, I just, it feels like they've chosen her over me and I have enough issues thinking I'm not good enough to have the friends I have. And, it hurts that they don't see how insecure I am, or don't care. I mean, Helen knows. We've had talks about how we feel like we bug people and all the shit that's getting me right now (except for the Kristin thing, because they're really good friends and I don't do that thing where I tell someone how much I hate their best friend). And, when I text her and I'm like, &quot;What are you up to today?&quot; And she says she's just gonna lounge around her apartment and I mention that sounds lovely but I'm not good at sitting for that long, and she basically just gives me instruction on how to spend a day alone, I just... and when I text Grant and am like, &quot;Hey, what are you up to?&quot; and he doesn't say anything...when I know they're both hanging out with Kristin...I don't know, maybe I sound like I horrible person. I think I do. But, I'm also just hurt that I mean so little to these people. I mean, </lj-cut>I usually (excluding my drunken crying session) don't do dramatic shit when I'm upset, and usually I just try to get through whatever I'm doing until I can be alone. I don't know, maybe that's what you have to do in this group for anyone to realize that you're upset or not okay.<br /><br />You know what.  I'm not that person.  I don't 'suffer-in-silence,' I know that.  I'm not that person that <i>everyone</i> thinks is okay. <br /><br />   But, these people that are used to small dramatic break downs should know what a very large slow one looks like."

"event","Okay, so really I'm just a non-fucking-person to her.  Before I just thought she was a bitch to me.  No, she's mean.  Before I was mad, now it's starting to get hurtful.  Every time she opens her mouth to speak to me, it's either to disagree with my opinion or to try and disprove what I've just said.  That is, unless someone else agrees with me, then she does too.  She comes in, I haven't seen her all day, and (because I like to be pleasant) I ask her how her day was.  And, depending on her mood, she either just says fine, or she launches into a big story.  But then, that's it.  I hold the fucking door open, again because what am I gonna do, slam it in her face, and she just walks through and starts talking to whoever is closest.  And, every time she speaks to me, without fail, she talks to me like I'm a dumb ass.

However, she sees other people and she's all, ""How are you?""  (She then launches into something completely different that has nothing to do with their answer, so at least that's not just to me.)   Or, someone else hold the door open and she smiles and says thank you.  She agrees with every one else, even if it's something I've said previously that at the time she disagreed with (which has happened multiple times).  And everyone else is the smartest person she's ever met."

"event","So, my roommate and I were trying to get a house together with a few other friends.  We were gonna try at least.  We'd been talking about it all semester, we'd driven around and gotten numbers.  Everything was going along.  

So, Monday, we're sitting at lunch and we haven't talked for 15-20 minutes.  She looks at me and says, ""So, I've been talking to Katie (a friend of ours), and she wants to live off campus but she doesn't wanna live with Grant (another friend of ours that we were talking about living with).  So...me and her are gonna get a place together.  'Cause she doesn't have any problem with getting an apartment (I want a house so I can have my dog) and neither do I really (she had wanted to bring her dog up, too).  Grant doesn't think I house with four people would be a good idea, anyway.""  So I said, okay, I guess I'll have to find someone else to live with.  And then she looked at me with this, ""You're stupid,"" look she has and says, ""Um, <i>Grant</i>?""  Then, a little later, when we weren't talking again she was like, ""I didn't mean to drop a bomb on you, I just have to do what's best for me.""  So, I thought that was kind of shitty.

But, then I come to find out, she talked to everyone of ours friends about it but me.  She told me Monday, my friend Rachel said that she had been talking about it the Saturday before at this party we were at when I had gone off to get a drunk friend of ours water.  Apparently she said, ""I just don't think me and Courtney can live together.  But, I could live with you Katie, that won't be a problem.""  And Katie shrugged and was like, whatever, which is very Katie like.  And when I told our friend Helen that Kristin was gonna live with Katie, she didn't sound surprised at all and started saying that living by myself could be really nice.  And our friend Rachel said that Grant had talked to her and said he wouldn't mind living with me and another person.

So, basically, everyone knew, she was talking to everyone about this, <i>but</i> me.  And, instead of telling me the truth, that we wouldn't do well living together (which does seem to be very true seeing as a want to scream at her a good portion of the time), she coped out and blamed it on Grant and Katie.

She also does that thing where, someone will tell a story, and instead of commenting on it or seeming like she cares <i>at all</i> she launches into something completely different, seemingly with no regard for anyone else or what anyone else was saying.

And, I fucking ask her how she is all the time.  ""How are you doing today?"" ""What are you up to today?"" ""How was your day?""  All those kind of questions.  And you know what she does?  She answers, and that's all.  Maybe it's the way I was raised, but when someone asks you how you are, you ask them in return.  It's polite and something <i>friends</i> should do.  And, theoretically, we're friends.

Sadly, all I can see now is this selfish chick with no regard for anyone else's feelings.

My friend Caroline's view on this: ""For someone that has emotions coming out of her ears, I can't believe that she can't see that other people feel them too...at all.""

"event","Okay, so I feel like a bitch, but I have to get this all out:

My roommate and I are getting on each other nerves, which is to be expected.  Not only do we live in a 14x10 room, but we're friends so we're around each other even more.  We recently started getting into little fights and shit.

The other day we had this discussion about how we really need to take a break from each other.  She said it wouldn't happen, cause we have the same friends and we'd all end up hanging out 'cause I introduced her to all my friends, and they love her and they're now her friends too, which really doesn't bother me.  What bother me is, I told her that no, it would happen.  The problem is, in order for us to take a break from each other, we'd need to spend more time with our other friends.  Unfortunately, we have the same set of friends exactly.  So, for us to get a break, one of us gets left out.  I said this to her, and she just kind of shrugged and went about whatever she was doing.  She didn't agree or she didn't care, I don't know which.

Here's the problem, she's getting her space...by calling the people we usually hang out with together as soon as they get done with classes and such and going to hang out with them.  She does it in such a way that I don't know it's happening until she's leaving, and she tells me in such a tone that I know if I invite myself she'll get annoyed and shit will start.

I get needing space, I get this.  The thing is, she gets space with our friends, and I get left sitting alone in the dorm.

In fact, today I called a male friend of ours and was like, lets grabbed food.  Just me and him.  While we were deciding where to go, my roommate showed up.  It was dinner time, and I'm not so mean that I would tell her she couldn't come (which is what I would have had to do) so we all went out to eat.  Sadly, I didn't get the time apart from her, hanging with a male friend, that I so desperately craved for.  So, while she got to leave the room tonight to go hang out with the only people I would be able to call if I wanted to hang out with someone at this time of night, I'm left sitting in the room not even having that small reprieve from earlier.

So, I bitch to my male friend online, and he tells me I'm looking to much into things.  And, he doesn't get that, while girls are not the root of all evil, we're pretty fucking mean to each other and me thinking she's going behind my back isn't completely crazy.

Is it?  Please, please, someone tell me.  Because I'm stuck between feeling like a bitch and feeling justified. :("

"event","Okay, the head of Jazz Studies at my school just replied to an update I made on twitter about a month ago.  The update said, ""I didn't get in.  Goddamn the UNT: COM Jazz Faculty...but just for today.""  Which, okay, bitter and not so cool I know, but I honestly didn't mean anything by it, I was just upset.  More at my lacking ability than anything else and sometimes you just wanna blame other people.  I know they didn't do anything wrong, I know they did what they had to and I didn't get in and that's fine.  But, I check my @replies thing to see if anyone has responded to any of my updates and I see this reply by a random person.  It says, ""Just so you know, the head of the UNT Jazz Studies Faculty (me) uses twitter.  I hope you get over your upset about not getting in soon.""

Needless to say I freaked out and checked to see if I had any personal info. on there.  I had this on there, but I deleted my web page details.  However, it is the internet and for all I know he's reading this right now.

But here's the things, I am a logical human being, I'm fairly certain I know why I didn't get in, and I understand.  But, I needed to vent a little to get it out.

I replied to his @reply and said, ""I was upset about not getting in, but that had nothing to do with anyone else.  It was just me venting.  I'm sorry if I offended.""  Which I really am, I didn't mean what I said before and I knew at the time that I didn't which is why I added the, ""...just for today,"" onto the end.  

I love this school, I love the program, and neither will change because of something that I knew would probably happen.  Best Jazz School in the US!  I knew this, I know this, and I didn't expect to get in, but I made it past the screening and I was hoping I might be able to do it.

Not getting in hurt, and I reacted, in a fairly small fashion I feel, which is stupid cause I know everyone gets online...I just, gah.  Now I'm freaked out. *shiver*"

"event","Why can't guys just be like, ""I wanna fuck you,"" instead of dragging you through all these emotional hoops for you only to find out that that's really all they wanted?  I could deal with that.  Going into a 'relationship' knowing that all he wants is to fuck me would be wonderful, cause then I don't fool myself into thinking he really wants me and yet I still get sex, it's a win/win.  Maybe, <i>maybe</i> I'm a little insulted in the beginning, but I don't end up getting hurt worse in the end.  A little pain to start is soooo much better than that horrendous rejection feeling you get at the end when you finally see the light."

I was totally surprised and I know I most likely gave one of those thin-lips-tilted-up-at-the-corners you-make-me-miserable smiles.  I just don't know if he saw it.  But, we basically almost ran smack into each other.  I spent the next, like, twenty minutes vibrating.  It's not too big a deal though, we live in the same building it's bound to happen.

So, my and Kristin(my roommate) decide to go eat.  We're planning to go across campus to eat at another dining hall, but then we look at the menu posted outside of ours and decide we like the food choices better.  So, we go in, stand in line, and get our food.  I ask Kristin which side she'd like to sit on, she points to a side and I head to find a table while she finishes making her salad.  I start at one end of the side she choose, head around the perimeter to get to the middle-front where I stop and plan to sit by the windows.  But, it just doesn't feel right, so I look and spot where I'd rather sit and start moving again toward there.  When I set my tray down and look over at Kristin, she's walking the path I'd just taken and laughing a bit.  ""I kept thinking you were gonna sit down but you didn't.""  I laughed and said something like, ""I wanted to sit here.""  I sit down, look up, and see I'm facing Blake's table which is across these fake plant things about two tables away and some extra space they allowed for the fake wall that's there.

Suddenly, I'm kind of embarrassed.  I'd had no idea he was sitting there and I still have no idea if he saw me sit down or my weird traipse across the cafe.  I could have switched spots with Kristin, come to think of it more now I really probably should have so at least my back was to him, but I didn't.  I stayed where I was sitting, fearing it would be way to obvious if we moved to another table.  Kristin, when she saw that I'd noticed, was like, ""Yeah, I was thinking 'man, Courtney's brave today'.""

I just felt really stupid.  Kristin said there's no way he didn't see me, and I don't know if I think that's good or not.

Gah, every time I see this kid, I feel like I'm getting punched in the gut.  It's really fucking annoying."

"event","So, last night I felt like being a tiny bit self destructive.  So, I went with some friends to go smoke.  We got what we needed and decided to go to a park (with my prompting, I love smoking in parks).  It's fairly easy, you just have to stop lighting up whenever a car comes by and if someone stops you go and start swinging on shit.  So, we're smoking and every time a car comes by my friend Hitch freezes and gets the paranoid freaked out look on his face.  And, okay, this kid has done so much shit you'd think he'd know how to act calm and cool...yeah, no.  If anybody had actually come up to us he would have been a dead giveaway.

So, smoking, and a cop car comes by and slows down (we figure he's checking out the online car in this park parking lot, which is ours btw).  We hear a door slam and we're all kind of frozen before we start walking around.  I've got the pipe, and Hitch has the stuff.  I start to walk out from behind all the play stuff.  I mean, the cop knows we're there, so yeah lets stand awkwardly hidden by childrens' play equipment.  *eye roll*  So, as I'm walking around Hitch does this like hissed, ""Hey you, get back over here.""  I'm annoyed but I do walk back over.  As I walk around behind him, he takes the pot out of his pocket to give it to me.  Well, I'm not thinking and I take it.  Which was stupid, I should have said no and made the scared shit keep it.  He had this panicked look on his face.

Who the fuck does that, give drugs to there friend so if they're caught they can take the fall?  Anyway, so our friend Grant goes and starts swinging on the swings (which, I thought was a nice little touch).  The cop has then moved his car and shines his big ol' yellow light on us.  I go over and start swinging with Grant.  Then the cop does the loud speaker thing and is like, ""The park is closed.  Please leave.""  Or something like that.  So, we leave, and head over to a friend of Hitch's that is a major stoner.

We smoke there and after about an hour I'm completely fucked up.  It's like, every thing's hitting my long term memory first so I'm forgetting things as they happen for a second and then picking them up and everything seems crazy surreal and all I wanna do is go back to my dorm lay down and sleep.  So, after some discussion, we do leave, drive back to campus.

On the drive back I get this text from my roommate, ""So you should be glad you're not playing apples to apples with us right now.""  I ask her why and she says, ""Oh, we're in the red room [a little dorm tv room that's in our building].  The box says, donated with love from Blake Eakin to the front desk.""  And, God, I've never felt worse while high.  

I mean, it had been a good day.  We'd spent the whole days after my audition (which went nicely) playing board games, going to eat, laughing a lot.  And, I'd just gone off with another group to get high. *shrug*  It had been a good day pretty much, not even too much thought about him and what happened, just passing stuff.  Suddenly, it's like my brain is broken and the weird long-term-memory first thing is happening, but on repeat.  So, I know I've seen his name and it hurt, but it's like a keep seeing it in my mind for the first time and it keeps hurting anew every time.  Over and over, I'm sitting there and I know this is stupid, I'd already seen the name and the moment had passed, but it's like my brain didn't know that and was replaying the memory over and over again and I was feeling it physically because of my high...like I was on a really jerky roller coaster.

I actually got back to my room, changed a bit, went out to the red room, talked, watched them play, and looked at the box (which my friend Katie showed to me) while this fun roller coaster was going on in my head and body.  I said I was gonna go to sleep (cause trying to keep up with apples to apples was proving way to difficult) and headed back to the room.  The weird roller coaster feeling went on until I finally fell asleep, which was horribly hard.  I just...I felt horrible.  And I wanted to cry, but I couldn't and it hurt...it hurt so much.

Never again, I'm never fucking doing this again.  The self destructive behavior is fine, the sex is fine, but the having feelings for someone thing...fuck that shit."

"event","Suddenly a good portion of the people I know are pissing me off.  So, Blake did his shit, which was bad, let me tell you.  My roommate and friend Helen have been around, helping me not think about it and things like that.  There was shopping therapy and me making fun of the noise that kid makes when he comes (which was really funny, even at the time, but I was caught up in the moment).  And, I know I'm not annoying them.  I'm not being overly mopey, every thing's fine and Helen and my roommate are getting along crazy well (which makes me happy, I like when my friends like my other friends).  So, I have an audition tomorrow, and they makes me go practice (cause, very important).  I practice for a little over an hour before I start getting tired and the practice starts getting tedious.  I grab my stuff, go drop off my key, come back to my room, go to the bathroom, put some clothes away, clean off my bed, then I call Helen.  She answers and I ask if they're still in our friend Katie's room.  She says yeah, and I ask if I can come up.  She says, ""Well, the movie's almost over.""  And I'm like, ""I didn't know you guys were watching a movie.  I don't mind, I just don't wanna be alone.""  She's kinda distracted (although I know the movie is paused) and she says something to somebody and then says to me, ""Okay, but you're gonna be coming in just to watch the last half hour of the movie.""  Honestly, I don't give a shit.  I don't wanna be alone, I kind of figured she'd get that, you know, when I said it.  So she sounds annoyed, and I'm gonna ignore it, and then I'm like fuck this I've dealt with enough awkward not-really-invited-but-didn't-wanna-be-alone in the last 48 hours to kill a horse.  So I was like, ""You know, nevermind.  I'll see you guys later.""  In that overly I'm-fine-but-if-you-knew-me-you'd-know-I-was-really-pissed voice.  She was like, ""Okay, later.""  Okay, so in my head I was a little bitchy-annoyed myself.

So, my friend Hitch texts me.  Hitch, who yesterday basically said that what Blake did was okay and that he'd done thing similar himself because he didn't want a relationship or wanted sex and wanted to keep open the possibility for more sex even though he had to know that that was not what I was up for hearing at that moment.  So, that jack-ass-kid texts me and says, ""Hey, have you looked for my piano key?""  (Which, he'd left in my room on my floor last semester)  I says, ""No Honey, I haven't.  I'll look for it tomorrow after my vocal abilities decide the fate of my life, k?""  And he just says back, ""Okay, thanks.""  So I text back, ""Yeah, k, you're super welcome.""  Well, this he seems to get.  So he says, ""What are you upset about?  Is it the Blake thing?"" 

That was like taking a bullet, I gotta be honest.  I really didn't expect him to bring that up, or to use the guys name of all things.  So, I tell him such and then just tell him I'm worried about the audition.  He says, ""Trust me, you'll do fine.""  Blah, stupid stupid.  

Whatever.

I'm really fucking nervous, and I hope I don't bomb tomorrow.  Fuck the boy, I want into this music school!"

"event","I'm not a stupid girl.  He makes me stupid, and I don't know what to do.  We had plans to hang out last night.  He called me about an hour and a half before hand and asked if I wanted to hang out right then.  I said yes of course.  In his room there was a small pillow fight, comforter tugging, tickling, and fucking.  The fucking was the last part of that.  There was making out, and grinding, and boob action, and me saying, ""Okay. Clothes. Off.""  Afterwards he got up, threw the condom away, got dressed (at that point I got dressed to), and sat down next to me (pressed against me for some reason) while he made other plans.  He was on the phone asking a friend when they were playing this coffee shop about a ten minute walk from where we were (his dorm room, btw).  When he got off the phone he said he was going to watch his friends band play at the Hydrant (the coffee shop) and I could come if I'd like.

I should have gotten up; I should have said fuck you, I gonna go, I have other plans, no it's cool but thanks for the sex, ANYTHING other than staying to see what the fuck was going on.  No, instead I tell him that I have this problem where I still like him.  He says, oh.  I ask him if he likes me.  He says sometimes he does.  He says he's unstable.  He says sometimes he doesn't want me to look at him 'cause he doesn't want me looking at such an unstable person.  He says that he guesses when asked if he likes me he should say no 'cause he can't keep his mind straight about anything.  He says that he's like this with everything and he's sorry his messing with my emotions in all this.  This would all be kind of chivalrous, had he not just fucked me.

Again, I still like this kid ('cause I'm nice and fucked up like that, he tells me he doesn't and I still wanna save it).  I confess some other stuff, I know I tell him about my whole hook-up-then-forget norm and that I still keep thinking about him, and that this is strange and not me-like.  I ask him if he likes being around me from time to time.  He says yes with that tone that says, 'yes, of course.'  I tell him I like being around him from time to time too, ""Just...so you know.""  He says he's going to his friends thing.  He tells me again, in some form or fashion, that I can come if I want.  I quickly weigh going back to my empty room vs. walking the 4 or 5 blocks to the coffee shop with him and decide that alone would not be good even when faced with massive amounts of awkward.

So we walk, we talk some (that part is completely normal), and comment on houses in Denton a bit.  I'm giving off massive don't-touch-me-unless-you-mean-it vibes, so there is no bumping of shoulders or any such thing.  We get there, talk to his friends some.  They include me in the little circle they form, which is oddly comforting.  Then they head up to get ready, and we go inside.  He gets something from the coffee bar, and gets me a tea (he asked what I wanted, I said tea *shrug*  The least he can do I figure).  We head upstairs to where the band will be playing.  He see too friends, we pull up chairs to their table.  Sit, not talk, one of his friends asks if I live in the dorms and makes some small talk with me (again, oddly comforting).  I text my friend Helen and tell her I'm stuck in the awkward of all awkwards and that I most likely need a rescue.  She comes, looking all nervous and kind of frantic.  She sits, I stand and talked to her a bit, he can't hear us.  Then we decide to leave.  I go over to him, tell him I have to go, give him a hug (cause I felt the need for a small bit of physical closure for some reason), and we leave.

Helen and I walk around the square, I tell her what happened (softening the sharp edges of course, cause I still fucking like him and for some reason don't want her to hate him as much as a friend should when hearing this lovely story).  So, we're going around a corner on campus as who should we see turning a corner in front of us?  Blake.  He sees us and waves a bit and then keeps walking.  I call to him, ask him if his friends are already done playing.  He said, no, that he came back to the dorms to see if some friends wanted to hang out.  So, he left the coffee shop about ten minutes after I did (which is odd, I guess).  Then we walked to the door, went in, Helen and I went in our direction, he his.  I threw a say you later at him, he kind of grunted in response, and Helen and I went up to my room.

When telling my roommate this story, I got much sadder much more upset and Helen got much more pissed off at the guy, as did my roommate.  There was chocolate, and a bored game, and Dane Cook, and I still feel like shit. 

I won't let him ruin my life.  I'm gonna go to class, and I'm gonna have an audition tomorrow, and I'm gonna try, but I'm fairly certain this is what moving through quicksand feels like."

"event","Ten things you wish you could say to 10 different people:

1. I love you to death, you are my best friend, but you just don't get it and it's not fair that that makes you angry.

2. You're a very good friend, lots of love, but you have a habit of making my feelings feel inadequate.

3. You've had a hard time of it, I don't know all you've been through, but even with all that shit, you always understand me, and that's why you're my Wifey-to-be.

4. Sex is fun, you know you missed it, pull your head out of your ass.

5. I'm really not that into you.  I'm sorry, I know you have grown a little attached, but I don't share in those feelings...whatever they are.

6. I kind of really want to fuck you, but I'm glad you're happy with your girlfriend and I don't have a thing for you anymore.

7. You broke me.  You took this little piece that a kept away, and you stomped on it.  And just when I'd picked the pieces up, had the glue drying, you knocked them off their perch just to be stepped on again.

8. Make up your fucking mind.

9. Think of other people baby.  You're a pretty girl, but you won't always get by on that.

10. I don't actually miss you that much.

Nine things about yourself:

1. I sing and write music and can't think of doing anything else, because I truly belief nothing will ever touch the feelings I get when doing those two things.

2. I was born in New Jersey, and I identify with that greatly.

3. I'm Irish, and I'm prideful.

4. I have the best friends ever I think.

5. I don't understand what people see in me that makes them wanna keep me around.

6. My mother is an emotionally abusive woman that I don't think I could live without.

7. My feelings never feel enough.

8. I kingdom for a place of my own, and when I get it, I will hide.

9. I say yes too much, and try too hard to live for other people.


Eight of your favorite bands/people:
1. Third Eye Blind

2. Panic at the Disco

3. My Chemical Romance

4. Sigur Ros

5. A lot of jazz but it's too much to put here. 

6. Augustana

7. Sarah McLachlan

8. Danielle Nations


Seven things that cross your mind a lot:
1. Why don't I practice more?

2. Can I just sleep?

3. I should be working now.

4. I wanna do that, how will I afford it?

5. I don't need sleep.

6. Sex would be nice.

7. Why doesn't he want me?

Six things you wish you never did:

1. Let myself fall.

2. Failed to practice.

3. Didn't try harder.

4. Didn't fuck him.

5. Stopped hoping.

6. Stopped letting myself have what I want.

Five of your favorite websites:
1. Facebook.

2. Livejournal

3. Youtube.

4. Wikipedia.

5. Twitter.

Four movies you love:

1. Cruel Intentions

2. White Oleander

3. Across the Universe

4. Rent


Three things you want to do before you die:

1. Live in Manhattan.

2. Write something truly meaningful.

3. Let myself fall, without being caught, but have someone to fall with me.


Two smiles that describe you: 
1. ;)
2. =P

One thing you never want to loose:
1. My sight (in the metaphorical sense)/my hearing."

"event","Dear Mom,

You get that I'm gonna leave you, right?  You get that one day, after one of our more malicious blowouts when my head is pounding because you decided it would make you feel better to beat on it for a bit, I'm going to suddenly remember that I don't have to stay here and deal with you anymore.  I'm going to suddenly remember that I'm 'all grown up' and I'm going to leave you, and there will be an 80% chance that I will never speak to you again.  You do realize this, right?  'Cause if you don't. I feel incredibly sorry for you.

Love,
Your Daughter"

"event","Okay, I hate-<i>hate</i> when you're online.  I'm older, the internet was technically mine first.  So, you should totally respect that.  You should also know, somehow, that I think about you at least 5 total hours out of the 14 or so I'm awake for some fucking reason (the number's gone way down, I will admit) and that you being online and not talking to me just makes it worse.  You're fucking cruel, I should know that by now.  Honestly, why am I surprised by this?  You've been nice, ignored, made me fall (in whatever way I fall that I refuse to admit to anyone), and stopped talking to me again, why wouldn't you do something that you must know would drive me crazy?  Nice guys don't exist, not really...I just *head desk*.  Fucking go away!

*sigh*  To any unfortunate person reading this: I feel better."

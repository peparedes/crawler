So a lot has been going on lately. I love Eric. I really do. I'm crazy about him. He is so sweet and he likes me so much and I always have fun when we're together. And I'm happy we're still together.
So Jeff... yeah. I really wanted him to forgive me because I felt so bad for what I had done. So I made him a card with my picture on the inside. It was really cute. Then one night, in the middle of the night, me and my friends went to his house and wrote ""I miss you Jeff"" huge in sidewalk chalk in his street. It took up the whole street. and I took a picture. which was good, cause he never saw it. It rained. But even after I sent him the picture, he still didn't forgive me. So me and my brother made him a movie. And it was the greatest thing ever. and it was to the song ""You're Still the One"" by Orleans. and I took it over to his house to give it to him but he forgave me before he even saw it. so he forgives me. and you would think that would be the end of this mini-drama. But no. Last night he called me and we talked for a while and then when we were getting of the phone I said that I thought he was calling to tell me something important but that it was nice just to talk. so a few minutes later he calls back and says he really did call to tell me something important and he hoped it didn't ruin my night. and he told me he's in love with me. and once again, I didn't know what to say, how to respond. I just said that it didn't ruin my night, that it made me happy, cause, seriously, who doesn't want to hear that someone loves them? it's very flattering. 
But now I don't know what to do. do I love him back? I do love him, but am I in love with him? I'm torn because the love I feel for jeff is very strong just because he's one of my best friends and I've known him for a long time. And the love I feel for Eric isn't very strong, just because we haven't been together very long, and to throw out a cliche, it hasn't had time to grow. so I'm conflicted. is that even a word? I don't know. This is what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid that for me Jeff is safe. I assume that he's always going to be around, for me to fall back on, and thats wrong and probably not true. I can't lead him on just because I want that safety. and I'm also afraid of hurting him again. But what if he truly is the one for me and that's why he's still around? How do I know? I can't picture myself spending the rest of my life with Eric. But I can picture Jeff in my life forever, in some form or fashion. How do I decide what to do? How do I know who's the one for me? It must be nice for Jeff and Eric to know exactly how they feel. I don't know that I've ever known exactly how I've felt about anyone. Well except one, the one, and I don't talk about him any more. I'd pull a Rory Gilmore and make a pro-con list but I think I would come up even. I want to cry. I really do."

"event","Let's see... what has been going on lately. Last week I was really sick and the doctor thought I had mono. Which I might have and would explain why I've been so sick so many times in the past month. 
Well me and Eric are still together. I go through periods where I really like him, and then I don't like him as much. But right now I like him a lot. and I wish we could see each other more than once a week. and I wish we had somewhere to hang out other than my dorm room because I don't really like that. Don't ask me why.
so some bad stuff happened last week. Danny and his selfish self decided it would be a good idea to tell Jeff about what went on with us this summer. And Jeff is so pissed. I've never known him to be this angry. He says I could cut his heart out with a knife and stomp on it and it would not hurt as much as the pain he has felt since Danny told him. He asked Danny to stay away from me, and he didn't. and I feel so guilty. I have no excuse. I've never known myself to not have an excuse. But this time, there is no excuse. I should have stayed away from Danny. because now I have broken Jeff's heart twice. He says he still loves me but I don't think hes going to forgive me. So I want to come up with some really creative and fantastic way to get him to forgive me. me and my friends are going to do something this weekend. and hopefully when he sees how much trouble I will have gone through, he will forgive me and be my friend again."

"event","Dude, classes got cancelled today because we didn't have any power on campus. It was pretty much the greatest thing ever. 
My boy came over this afternoon and we basically spent two hours kissing. Also fantastic. I like him... most of the time. It's really hard for me to make up my mind. But I guess that's how it is with a lot of relationships. I mean, most of the time you are not absolutely sure in the beginning what your feelings are or how it will end. But you know you do have some feelings and you have to hold out to see if they turn into something more. And that's the point I'm at now. I know I have feelings for him, but I'm waiting to see where it's going. if anywhere at all."

"event","Well things with Eric are good now. at least for the moment. I'm so wishy-washy. I can't make up my mind. I think I'm just not used to a guy being so nice and attentive that I'm not sure how to react. I do like him though. I wish this whole thing had started earlier in the summer. Now I'm getting ready to go back to school and I'm not gonna have any time to see him. I'm not sure how well it will work. I guess we'll just have to see. The other night me and him talked about some stuff. And it was stuff that should have made me like him less. But for some odd reason, it actually made me like him more. I'm not sure why.

So I'm not really sure what the deal with Eric is. I like him and he think he's a really great guy. I just wish he was the same age as me. and I wish he wasn't quite so obsessed. I dunno. Emily says I'm picky. Maybe I am.

I wouldn't have answered except my shoulder devil wanted to make him jealous. so I answered and I could tell he was jealous. and Eric knew I was talking to a guy and he probably wasn't happy about it but I didn't really fill him in on who it was. so then after I left Eric, by the way, we had a really good time, I called Michael back. We met up in a parking lot and I just couldn't stop being mean to him. He does deserve it. and we talked and I didn't feel anything for him. and I went home and I talked to eric on the computer. we are dating exclusively now. which is good I think. and michael calls again. and he told me that there is no one better for me than him. which couldn't be farther from the truth. then he told me that he loves me more than anything in the world. you know, I'm gettin pretty tired of guys saying the L-word. and I just don't love him any more. I really like eric and I want things to work out with him."

"event","This was one of the best weekends I have had all summer. Friday night, there was a party at Chickasaw and I thought it was a lot of fun. Working it, I mean. It was easy work. After work, I went to hang out with Eric. We went over to a couple of his friends' houses. Then when I was leaving, we talked by my car for about an hour. And he kissed me. Later that night, he told me he liked me, that he had for a while. I actually had no idea. Then Saturday I had to work but it rained so I got off early. Then Saturday night I went to a party with Emily and Eric came. and I had a really good time. Then Sunday I went to church and then I had to work (geez I say that a lot)and then we had a guard party. Then after the party, Eric and I went to a movie. And we held hands and I feel like such a little girl. But it has just been so long since a guy has been this nice to me. So long since a guy has wanted to spend time with me. And honestly, it's been a long time since I have felt this way about a guy. I like him more every time I see him. so for the moment, I'm just going to ignore the fact that he is younger than me...
Last night, I sent Danny an email telling him that whatever we had or didn't have is over. And I know an email is lame, but he once broke up with me on the internet so I figure what goes around comes around. And I doubt he even fuckin cares."

"event","Wow... I have a lot to say. First of all, I love my new job. It is a-mazing. Last week I was really sick and my older brother came home. Which was really cool cause it had been over a year since I had seen him. So we were busy with brother stuff and I was sick. Then we had the city swim meet on Saturday and I did alright considering my illness. Then Sunday me and my mom and my aunt Cindy and uncle Jim and Jennifer and Will flew to Washington DC because Jim had a weather conference. And we had a nice little vacation. I love DC. I think it is the coolest city. If I were ever live anywhere else, that would be one of my top choices.
So a little drama while I was in DC. which is amazing considering I was in another zip code. One night Jeff sent me a text message asking me to tell him, honestly, how I feel about him. and I had been thinking about him. I do like him in some ways but I could never picture myself with him. And I still like Danny. But when I came home I asked Danny to hang out with me and at first he said he was free and then later he said he was busy. and that just pisses me off. He never has time for me. Its been three weeks since the last time we were together. he can only hang out with me when he has nothing better to do. and I hate that. so I'm really pissed at him right now.
Also, while I was in DC, Michael called. Crazy, right? And I answered and he was calling to apologize for being such a jackass three months ago. and it was really nice. and we talked and kinda caught up. But we haven't talked since. and I'm wondering if it was a one time thing. and I'm wondering if that would be a good thing. I mean, I'm glad he apologized. and I accept his apology but I still think we are no good for each other.
Ok so new boy. His name is Eric. and he is so cute. and I work with him and his dad is best friends with my dad and he swims on my swim team so thats how we know each other. So a few weeks ago I had a dream about him and we've been joking around about it ever since. and last week he came over to my house for my brother's party and then we worked together thursday and then we had a swim team party and then we worked together friday and then we had the city swim meet all day Saturday. so we got to see a lot of each other. Then last night when I got off work he asked me to come hang out with him and his friends. so I did. and when I was leaving, we kissed. and I do like him. only problem? he's younger than me. he just turned 17 and he's going to be senior. but the thing is that he doesn't act like it. I would have never known if I hadn't asked him. so I don't really know where it will go from here. we'll just have to see."

I got a new job at Chickasaw Country Club and it is fantastic.
So I'm really pretty pissed at all my friends right now. Well I should be more clear. I'm pissed at all my friends from high school. All the people who have decided that they're too good for me. Especially two girls who used to be my best friends. I just don't understand when I became such a loser that people won't hang out with me any more. or acknowledge my existence.
I was really upset Saturday night. I started thinking about how lonely I am. and I started crying. But Monday? Monday, he came over. and I like him so much and he makes me so happy. I just wish he could see how good he is for me. and how much I want him. but I haven't said anything because I don't want to scare him away. But as long as I get to see him at least once a week, I'm ok. I'm happy. he makes me so happy. geez I wish he was mine."

I haven't cried that hard since me and Michael broke up. I was so upset. He is being an asshole. So hopefully by the end of today I will have a new job. Then we'll see how he runs the place without me.
I like him. It is amazing how the smallest thing - a text message, a phone call, a little kiss - gives me just a little hope to hold on to. A little hope that maybe he likes me. A little hope that maybe someday he will be mine again."

Jeff called while I was at Danny's house last night. It was awkward. I didn't know what to say. I called him back later and he asked me what I thought about our conversation the night before. I had been thinking about it all day and had not come to any conclusions. That is, until I went to Danny's. But I didn't tell Jeff anything. I just told him I was all confused and wasn't sure what or who I wanted. But after I got off the phone, I wished I has just told him. 
Danny is so hot. hahaha. The two of us are so hot together. I like him a lot. I just wish that he liked me too. And I wish that I lived in a world where he and I could be together. 
Oh and I don't know... I don't know what he's after. But he's so beautiful, he's such a beautiful disaster. And if I could hold on through the tears and the laughter, would it be beautiful or just a beautiful disaster?"

So I have been thinking about him a lot lately. I'm not sure why. So I called him last night and we talked for about an hour. We joked around about getting married and talked about other stuff. And then the conversation turned serious. He told me that I broke his heart. and that really upset me. I mean, I knew that I hurt him, but broke his heart? That's awful. I started telling him that the whole situation was my fault but he wouldn't hear it. He said that he was afraid that if he started thinking it was my fault, that then he wouldn't be able to forgive me. He told me that even when we haven't been talking to each other that he still thinks about me all the time. He said he was thinking about me when I called. He thinks about us being together but how it wouldn't work. And then the big one. He told me that he wasn't sure if he really knew what love is, but that he thinks that if he's ever loved someone, it was me. He said he really does love me. I didn't know what to say, I just said 'I know.' and then I went to bed. I just don't know what to do. I am so torn. Part of me thinks that maybe I love him too, that maybe I want to be with him. The other part tells me he's one of my best friends that I've known forever and that's as far as the love extends. I just don't know what to do. I'm afraid to break his heart again.
Then I couldn't go to sleep. and about 2 am Danny calls. and after the first phone conversation I was ready to tell Danny to forget it. But then talking to him, I don't know. So I'm going over to his house after work tonight. and I'm wondering if I'm making a huge mistake. I don't know which one of them I really want. and I suppose deep down I know I can't have either one. Why does love have to be so hard?"

To some that might not seem like many, to others, that may seem like a lot. To me, it seems like a lot. Especially since I only dated one of them. So if that many guys are wanting to kiss me, then why won't any of them love me? I just want love, real love. Of course, part of me still wants to be playful and say kiss em and leave em. But the other part of me, the hopeless romantic, wants to be in love. I am pathetic.
No matter what I do at work, I get in trouble. Every single thing I say turns out to be something wrong. When did I turn into the bad guy? Where is the justice.
Justice is a knee in the gut from the floor on the chin at night sneaky with a knife brought up down on the magazine of a battleship sandbagged underhanded in the dark without a word of warning. Garroting. That's what justice is when we've all got to be tough enough and rough enough to fight Billy Petrolle. From the hip. Get it?"

I can't help having a bad attitude when he forgets everything we tell him and the other managers are dumbasses. Then he actually called my dad yesterday to tell him about me and my brother and everything we're doing wrong. Which isn't anything. I'm sorry, but your job is a joke when your boss calls your mommy and daddy to tell on you. I guess I'm kinda glad that Jacob got in trouble too; at least I have someone on my side. 
I finally got up enough guts to tell him last night that I don't want to be just friends any more. I wanted to fall out of in between. But I got shut down. He admitted that he was just using me. I guess I knew, but I was hoping he liked me too. But he doesn't.

I'm really trying to relax and not be so hard on people though. And maybe I should spend less time at the pool. I have been up there every single day since it opened. Maybe that's a little much.
I like Matt. I don't know why, but I do. I'm too chicken to tell him though. He told one of friends that he wants to date me but not during the summer because he doesn't want any commitments. I think the summer is the best time. Does he really think we're gonna have a lot of free time when school starts up? Hah. And I've heard his excuses before. He's not the first guy who has used them. So I just don't see it happening.
So I did something stupid. big surprise. maybe I was mad about matt. or maybe I just wasn't thinking. But I went over to Danny's house at 11 last night. and things were a little more intense this time you could say. and sometimes I get the feeling that if I tell him to stop, one of these times, he's not going to stop. and that scares me a little. and he still doesn't understand why I think its not right. even if Jeff wasn't in the picture, it wouldn't be right. and he does not see that. not that he cares about what Jeff thinks any more anyways. he's too desperate. so I left before things got too far gone, but not before things got a little gone...
Today is Danny's birthday. He told me I could not come to his party because Jeff is going to be there and it might be awkward. Well you know what? Me and Emily are going to crash his party. Because nobody tells Heather what to do. and because I just want to stir up some trouble. I guess deep down I still want revenge..."

I wear my bathing suit to class because as soon as it is over at 10:30 I leave for the pool for swim team practice at 10:45 until 12. Then I have to work every night from 3-8 or 9. Then I have to find sometime to do hw and sometime to relax. 
Yesterday I just stayed at the pool instead of driving all the way home but even though I wasn't on the clock, I ended up working while I was there. It just frustrates me when things don't get done the way they should. Damn managers need to learn how to do their jobs better. I am the best fuckin lifeguard and best manager and it frustrates me when people don't do as good a job as I do. 
I saved two kids last week. It was exhilerating. And a relief to know that I can keep my head under pressure.
Boys. Boys boys boys. Danny wanted me to come over Monday but I told him I couldn't cause I had to be responsible. But I went over there last night. And I thought we were just gonna hang out. But I had maybe been there ten minutes and he kissed me. I pushed him away but then later he kissed me again. And I don't understand. Why is it ok for him to kiss me now but he couldn't be with me then? Why is it ok now? He said he didn't know. He doesn't seem to understand what effect things like this have on my emotions. I wanted to cry. Because I knew he was just using me. He is only after one thing and I just happened to be the one girl that answers her phone. And I really like being around him, just not like this. I want him to want me for more than just... that.

And there has been no drama. well Emily has had drama, bad drama, been there before drama, but it's not my drama. I have been trying to help her through it though because, like I said, I have been there before.
So basically I have been doing nothing on my break so far. laying out in the sun, going shopping, hanging out with what friends will answer their telephones. My mommy bought me a new wardrobe for my good grades. I'm so spoiled. I am very happy. I am very content to just sit and do nothing. I don't really feel any urgency to get out. This is the time for relaxing.
I went to a certain boy's house last Tuesday. And we watched a movie. But we didn't watch the movie... and it was so much fun. I have made a decision. I am in college and this is time for me to have fun. Lots of fun, when I want, with no strings attached. Simply because I can and because I want to. Not worrying about a thing. 
Remorse. What an interesting word. Why do some people feel remorse while others do not? Why is it that some people recognize when they have done something wrong, and feel bad for it, when others do not? I am far from perfect and I sometimes do things that are wrong. But I recognize my mistakes and I feel remorse. But others do not. Emily is having a hard time and people have done things wrong to her, but do they recognize this and feel bad for it? No. and do they understand that she will not forgive so easily? No. No remorse. A couple of weeks ago, I was having a really really hard time. But did those people feel remorse? Have they ever? No. I just find it interesting..."

"event","Today is a good day, I can feel it. They bought back my French book, so now I've got some extra cash, and its sunny, and I'm doing accounting and Gilmore Girls is tonight so its just a good day.
So she sends me an email last night to say that there is no friendship to save because we haven't been friends since before high school. and I got really upset because I always thought we were still best friends in high school. I mean, we were. so how is it that she's able to just block that out? I hate her. I hate her for hurting me. I just sent her an email saying no more emails please. I have come to realize in the past year or so that drama is no good. People only get hurt. I used to think that drama made my life more interesting but now I always end up getting hurt and I'm sick of it. I would rather not know than have my heart broken again and again. But I guess my heart can't really break when its not whole to begin with. So anyways, I find there's peace in not knowing and beauty in letting go. Just let it go.

"event","So yesterday...yeah... It was a pretty bad day. On my way to church yesterday morning I was driving along Mclain behind a blue suv. A car pulled out in front of the suv and the suv swerved, the woman lost control of the car, it spun into a guard rail and flipped over. Of course, I'm screaming and flipping out because I am the only car on Mclain besides a car in front of the suv. So I pulled over and called 911. First time in my life. and the lady was trapped in the car. and some other people stopped. and I was the only white girl standing out there in my church clothes. and it was really scary. the lady was screaming histerically and we couldn't do anything. Then the firemen and the ambulance got there and got her out. But I guess the scariest thing was that if I had left the school one minute earlier, that would have been me. and I was pretty shaken up the rest of the morning.
Then last night I come to find out that my ex-best friend is dating my ex boyfriend. And it kills me. I don't understand it at all, why they would do this to me when they know it kills me. Is there no one else in this city they can find? They must not be lookin very hard. And I hate them for it, I really do. This is just not cool. So I am very sad. very very sad.
Finals are this week. I have a French final today (J'ai un examen francais aujourd'hui) and then late I'm taking my take home life exam. and hopefully it won't kill me. Theology is just not my thing. Then Wednesday I have my accounting final and Thursday I have my piano final. so its cool. I'll basically be done by noon on wednesday cause piano isn't that big a deal. and then I can go home and be happy! yay!"

Friday at lunch I asked Danny to come sit with me and Jessica. and it wasn't awkward at all. It was fun. But then Jeff called while we were sitting there. and he conveniently forgot to tell Jeff who he was eating with. nice.
After lunch Brad came to my room to hang out. I was writing a paper. Then after his class he decided to come back. and my roommate was gone. and he kissed me. several times. I'm not sure why. he was a lot better kisser this time than the last time we kissed. he moves fast...
Friday night I went to my cousins tball game then last night I went and saw ""A lot like Love."" It was cute. It has been just a nice relaxing weekend. This is the last week of classes, then finals, then I can go home. yay!
One bad thing did happen last week. Michael called and woke me up one night to ask for ex-best friend Megan's phone number. I didn't give him her number and I was really pissed. he was really mean on the phone. why is it that when I try to block out all the bad in my life, it pushes its way back in? I wish that those two would just leave me alone and stay out of my life. I would be a much happier person if they did."

It was Rites of Spring and the music was good and the times were fun and the company was the best. Megan and me had a little bit of fun Saturday night and it was freakin awesome. It made the music sound that much better. I saw Emily for a few minutes Saturday afternoon to get the goods. I can't wait for her to be home. 
This week is so busy for me. In a little while I'm going to my piano lab which is going to suck so bad. I have to miss a volleyball game for it too. Then after that I have to study for accounting and meet with my life group. Then tomorrow night I have my accounting test, wednesday my life presentation, wednesday night a CPR test, thursday afternoon a piano recital, thursday night a play at Bolton, and Friday an english essay due. ewew. That is just too much stuff. But after this week only another 4 days of classes then finals and then we're done. yay!"

I think me and a few of my friends were the only ones not trashed too. It was so crazy. People were drinkin that I would never guess do that. It was insane. So that was the kick off to Rites of Spring which starts tonight. I might not go tonight though because it's my cousin Ben's first tball game and of course, I can't miss that. I might go to Rites after I get back. I dunno, we'll see. Then tomorrow is Rites to Play and Rites to Play harder and thats just a huge carnival so it will be tons of fun. Then tomorrow night more music and me and Megan are planning on having a little bit of fun, if you know what I mean. Emily's gettin me the hook-up. Hopefully it won't be like Knoxville =) It gonna be so much fun. I'm in such a good mood. 
So I've been thinkin, a dangerous pastime, I know. haha thats from Beauty and the Beast. But seriously. I have decided to completely cut myself off from all the guys that I have known in the past. It does not do me any good to keep going in circles like this. I need new guys, ones I don't have a history with. What brought this on you may ask? well one son of a mr. coley. and a rejection by said son. He said I wouldn't notice the age difference, but yeah, I noticed. felt like high school again. yuck. Also, I wasn't gettin any where with the other guys either. So I'm finished. Time to forget about that part of my life, stop living in the past and look to the future. That is what I am going to do. and seriously, this weekend is gonna kick ass.
Well now, I've been good for way too long, found my red dress, I'm gonna put it on, bout to get too far gone..."

I can't figure out why it is she cannot sleep through an entire night. She has to get up fifty million times. No good. So I went home. And I don't really care any more about what people think about me going home. If I wanna go home, dammit, I will. so thats that.
Friday afternoon I called Sean to see what he was doing. Then later that night me and my mom went to Mo's and he was there. It was kinda weird. But a good weird, I liked seeing him. He always tells me I look good. I'm sure he's lying but it still makes me feel good. and I've gotten to where I really like talking to him. I wish we could actually hang out ever. I don't think we've done anything together since we dated in the 9th grade. craziness. I don't know, I might be starting to like him. really I just want someone to make out with. hah.
So I'm in a good mood now, my depression passed over the weekend. I bought new clothes, of course, that's it. Like I've said before, shopping always makes me happy. But I feel alright now, ready to get this school year over with. Three weeks of classes left to go. and boy are they gonna be fun..."

So we decided that third floor robinson or trezevant would be our next choices. But then on the way there we hear that those are both full. So Voorhies it is. But Megan and Kendra decide they want to do Stuart. which is totally gay because its across the street. very far away. Me and Jessica don't want Stuart. So we ended up on third floor robinson which is ok I guess room wise but we don't know anyone up there. and we're about as far away from Megan and Kendra as can be. Its so shitty. They didn't want Stuart either and they changed their minds at the last minute cause they wanted to be on first floor... thats so gay. They totally left me hanging. we were supposed to room by each other, that was the deal. and they backed out. now I will never see them, I know I won't. and they're far away from everyone else too. grr. I'm pissed. curses. 
so my bestest friends Emily and Jessica I guess are too busy to call me back any more. and they were pretty much the only two from high school left. grr. what is it about me? something must be seriously wrong that people don't want to be friends with me."

things with orpheum guy are finally fini. he kept calling, one night he left a really serious message on my phone and finally I talked to Jacob about it. So he told him that I don't like him, that he's too needy. and I think he was pretty pissed off. he called and left a not so happy message on my phone. but I don't care. I'm just glad its done.
so I was talking to Sean a lot. but then all of the sudden he stopped calling. and I haven't talked to him in quite a few days. so I guess thats done too.
Saturday morning I ran in the Bunny Run. I ran two miles without stopping which is good for me. then me and Joel were running together and we decided to beat Dillon and so Joel held him back and I ran ahead and I beat him. It was fantastic. Sunday morning I went to the sunrise service. Megan was there but I didn't speak to her. Easter was fun. good food. I got an ipod. too bad it fucked up my computer and the headphones don't fit. 
I wanted to call Danny tonight. I finally talked myself out of it. I haven't talked to him in over three weeks. it was over a month ago that we stopped seeing each other. I guess I'm pretty much over him, but I still miss him. I finally talked myself out of calling him. I guess it wouldn't do any good anyways.
I played in my first volleyball game tonight. It was really fun. even when me and Sam collided and crashed to the floor. it sure is a lot easier for me to get up than him... =)"

Friday night Rachel dyed my hair for me. its dark brown. I like it. Saturday night we did... nothing. it was so very exciting. Then Sunday morning I went to the Golden Gate Full Gospel Baptist Church. It was insane. There were women dancing in the aisles and falling on the floor and literally running in circles around the sanctuary. It was so crazy but so much fun. Then every other spare moment I had this weekend was dedicated to doing homework. yuck. Homework is never fun. ever. if anyone thinks that it is, I will kill them. 
No boy drama this weekend. Jeff wanted to hang out Friday but I didn't think that was a good idea. it would have just brought on drama. orpheum guy called some but I didn't answer. he'll get the picture. Michael called at 3:50 Saturday morning. he just loves to call and wake me up. he thinks he's so funny. and I talked to Sean this weekend. nothing happened, but it was fun to talk to him. and that was my weekend.

Orpheum guy called three times last night within an hour. I didn't answer. I was trying to get ahead on some homework and I dunno, I just didn't want to talk to him. It's not there. I may be wrong, I'm not positively sure, but I don't think it's there. He's trying too hard. And it is very sweet but it's just not what I want right now. I feel really bad.

It just didn't. And I can't help how I feel.
The ball is in his court now. He didn't act on it. Not to say that I mind, because I admitted it was a mistake. But he doesn't know that. And he didn't make a move. I wonder why...
I have decided what I want... a cowboy. I want to ride down the road with a guy in a pick-up truck with his cowboy hat on and his tan, muscular arms... ah, fantastic. I think that's what I need.

"event","So yesterday was a very interesing day. I figured out that I either talked to or saw almost every single person who has ever liked me or whom I have liked. It was a crazy day. I was in a funk the entire day. And I really wanted to see him last night. I knew that if I waited until today the feelings would disappear. which they did. why is that? why is it that my feelings change so much from day to day? So I saw him last night. and we talked like old times. but it wasn't like old times. I'm not sure. Something was different. And afterwards I felt as if I had made a huge mistake. I'm leading him on, I know I am. because this will not go any where. it never does. I always end up in the exact same place. and I'm going to hurt him. I know I will. but I just wanted to see him. 
today I saw Danny. I turned around and there he was and he gave me this look like ""I know what you've been doing"" and I'm not sure what that look was for. he said hey and I said hey back but only because he caught me off guard. if I had had time to think about it I wouldn't have said anything back. I feel this strong urge to get revenge. why is that? I can't just let things go. and I have a feeling that last night was about getting back at Danny. which is very very bad. I'm not really sure if thats what it was or not. I hope not. too many people could get hurt. what I really need to do is just go into hiding. not talk to any of these boys. just be by myself or with my friends. see what happens then..."

Then today I saw Danny across campus for the first time since that awful day. Then after lunch I saw Ross who I also hardly ever see. It's like ex-boyfriend day or something. This morning I woke up and got dressed and I don't know if it was because I dreamed about him last night or what, but I missed Jeff. He was one of my best friends and I loved talking to him and hanging out with him. He is the nicest guy ever. I hate that he hurt me because he's never hurt me before and I've never been mad at him, in all the years I've known him. Until, now that is. I sent him a text message this morning saying ""I don't like being mad at you."" He never responded. I just don't know what to do. I want to be friends with him again, but then, I'm still mad at him. what do I do? Maybe I'll call him tonight. Maybe not. geez this is hard. I just wish I knew what he was thinking, what he was feeling. I wish I knew how I felt.
I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine... Weird how that song fits Jeff more than any other guy I know.
Speaking of my feelings, Jacob asked me the other night if I like Matt. I asked why and he said cause Matt told him to find out. I felt like we were 13 again. Honestly, I don't know if I like Matt. He's a very nice guy and he's very funny. I just don't know if it's there or not. It will probably be a while before I know.

All the people she hangs out with now are people I have pretty much avoided my whole life. Pretty, popular, hard partiers. Thats just not my scene and they're not my kinda people. And Emily seems to be turning into them. and that makes me sad. She was fine when it was just us two but when she was around her friends she was not very nice. kinda rude. she was actually gonna have me sleep in a stranger's room. she put me in her roommate's room and then they came in at like 4:30 wondering who the fuck I was. then whoever the guy was that was sleeping in emily's bed wouldn't shut up about how much he likes her. and he's not even her boyfriend. so I just left today. she didn't even call me to see if I made it back ok.
friday night was...interesting. I called a ton of people. I called Jeff and Danny. which was stupid. And Danny refused to talk to me. he said he was afraid I would say something I would regret. But I knew exactly what I was saying. he still wouldn't talk. but I talked to him on my way home today and it was ok. it was like we were friends. but now I'm talking to him. and I had to bring it up. I asked him if things could ever be fixed between us. and basically the answer is no. I thought I could forget about it, which is dumb, because I have never been one to forget anything. I still want him. I still like him. why does this have to be hard? It's not fair. Now I'm talking to Brad about it. which is strange. I had a dream about him last night, which is even stranger. I talked to Matt, orpheum guy tonight. I think he likes me. I just don't know what to do. I like Danny and it hurts that I can't have him. I hate not getting what I want."

He just gets on my nerves and all he talks about are girls, nothing else, and he never has anything funny or intelligent to say. he is very much getting on my nerves. so I surely hope he doesn't call me any more.

"event","Shit. That's what this weekend was. Shit. Excuse my language but there is no other word appropriate. Friday, me and megan and kendra and rachel and madoline went to Chick-fil-a for dinner. Then we came back and went to the basketball game and it kicked ass. The Mallory Maniacs were there and they crack me up and the Lady Lynx kicked ass. Then we went to CUP. (oh by the way, I've decided to use names in here because I figure, fuck it) So Danny sends me a text message Friday morning telling me his mom is outta town, obviously code for I want you to come over. Then at dinner I sent him a message asking him what he was doing that night and he said ""you."" Then I message him for CUP asking him if he wants to hang out afterwards and he says yes, and I say I'll call him. So I called him when CUP was over and he says ""no I'm going to go to bed, we'll reschedule"" so of course, I'm pissed because I hate it when people do that. if you say you're going to do something, fucking do it. I hate it when plans change. I'm not flexible at all, its one of my greatest liabilities. so I was pretty much in a bad mood after that. Then I get on the computer before I go to bed, and he's on there, obviously not in bed like he said. so then Saturday morning me and megan and kendra and rachel went to Chick-fil-a for breakfast and I saw Danny and Jeff there. Then about noon I get on the computer and Danny is on and he tells me he has bad news. Then he proceeds to tell me that he talked to Jeff again and that Jeff told him that it really hurt him that Danny was seeing me, so many fish in the sea, why did he have to choose me. I ask what this means and he says he can't see me any more. so I start crying. and frankly, I think this is a bunch of bull shit. Jeff never told me liked me and he never asked me out. he has no claim to me, I don't belong to him, and he can't say who I can date, or who Danny can date for that matter. So Jessica tells me I need to talk to Jeff about it. So I call him and it was just really sad because I've never been mad at Jeff before. and I told him that I really like Danny. and Jeff said he was really sorry for hurting me like this. and I think he really meant it but at the same time, I don't think he would take it back. he really doesn't want me and Danny to see each other. and as long as he doesn't want us to see other, Danny won't do it. so now I feel like shit. I really really liked Danny and things were better than ever. I was finally happy at this school and I was having a lot of fun. but now I just feel lonely. and its cheezy, but I feel like I miss him already. but I sent him an email today telling him that I can't be friends with him because it hurts too much. which is totally true. and it kills me that two days ago I was seeing this really great guy and now he's not in my life at all. and now I've lost Jeff as a friend too. because I can't be friends with people who hurt me. hurt me once, shame on you. hurt me twice, shame on me. and its weird because Jeff is blaming himself and Danny is blaming himself and neither one of them is blaming me, and I'm the one who started the whole thing. but its over now. and I'm really sad and upset. and it will probably be a while before I'm back to my old self. today I got up, after getting little sleep last night and I felt even worse. its starting to sink in that its over. I don't handle pain very well.
""It's killing me to know you, without having a chance to hold you, and I all I wanna do is show you how I really feel inside. You can run to me, you can laugh at me, or you can walk right out that door. But I can't be 'just friends' any more"""

"event","So I had a good weekend. Until Sunday, that is, when I got sick. I actually missed classes yesterday for the first time ever. but I feel much better now. Not 100%, but still better. So this weekend. well Friday night me and Kendra and Rachel and Danielle went shopping. I spent way too much money. I bought a bathing suit and it always depresses me to shop for bathing suits. I feel so fat. especially compared to others. then we came back to school and I went over to Jacob's to watch Kill Bill and to see if his friend would talk to me. But he didn't. I guess I'm just intimidating. 
then Saturday I went to the girls basketball game and we stayed for part of the guys because I wanted to see Dean Stackman get duct taped to the wall. it was funny. then I had a date Saturday night. it was our first date. yeah, we've been hanging out for a month now but this was the first time we actually went out somewhere together. and he acknowledged this which made me even more happy. he also finally told his friends about us and he said they were mad but that they'll get over it. then we went back to his house and watched 50 First Dates. and an old friend/crush called while we were watching it and so then I was distracted for a while because I just can't figure out why he called. it had been so long since I had heard from him. but then we watched the movie and that is like my favorite movie now. and it was fun and I was so happy. I am still happy. I wish I knew how he feels about me. Its hard for me to tell. I really like him though. Its weird. I actually want all the other guys that have been around to leave me alone. I don't want to play games any more. I only want one guy. I hope he wants me too =)"

"event","well ooo excuse me, That 70's Show is on... ok I'm good now. That's such a great show. So last night was fun, the show was good, Little Shop of Horrors. I didn't think it was a date but he gave me red roses, so I guess it was. He seemed really nice. So I was super bored tonight. So I went over to Jessica's and we watched Raise Your Voice. and even though we both love hilary duff, this was a terrible terrible movie. then we hung out and talked. I swear, we are practically the same person. we are always thinking the same things and we act the same way, especially when it comes to guys. its crazy. we're crazy. we've both determined this. 
This weekend could be fun, but then again, it could be really dull. Emily, my bestest friend, is supposed to be coming in town, but she'll probably be too busy to hang out. And then me and him are supposed to hang out Saturday but we'll see if that happens either. I really want to. I wouldn't bug him so much about it if I didn't want to. Its so weird. Its like a expect him to let me down. And Emily too. I don't trust people at all. I don't count on anyone because everyone seems to always let me down. of course it doesn't help that I get let down very easily. I wish I could trust again. I don't trust anyone. and its so hypocritical because I'm not trustworthy myself. and I'm really trying to be better and I'm doing good so far. but theres always room for a lapse. I'm really going to try though because I don't want to mess things up. well it turns out I don't have very much to say tonight. nothing exciting has happened since Valentine's Day. except for the roses of course. because what girl doesn't like roses?"

"event","Valentine's Day. What a day. Last year, Valentine's Day was horrible and I thought that I hated it. but yesterday? yesterday was good. my daddy sent me flowers and they were the biggest ones in the mail room. they're so pretty. and my mom gave me american eagle underwear which is by far the best underwear in the world. so that was awesome. and I got a box of chocolates...from a boy. I like him so much too. Why else would I spend two hours in the computer lab doing nothing? Because he was there. He's so funny and he cracks me up. And last night he told me that he's finally going to tell his friend about us. or our friend I guess. well he told someone who he thinks is going to tell him. which I think is kinda cowardly. but all the same, its about time, and it means a lot to me that he doesn't want to keep it a secret any more. maybe he can actually start calling me by my real name now. also we talked about whether or not we're seeing other people too and he said he's not so thats good. so I won't either. we're not classified as anything but still, its a start. so yeaterday was great. and I made him a cd with the best music in the world on it, country and oldies. hehe. I'm sure he was excited and I went to his house and his mom says I'm nice so thats a plus and it was fun. and I didn't want to leave. I never want to leave. and then today I ate lunch with him and I'm just happy. so happy. which is awesome for me. and I wanna see him again. better back off before I scare him away, hehe.
tomorrow night I'm going to the orpheum with Jacob and his date and some other guy. corporate box seats. awesome. I can't wait.
I talked to an ex boyfriend the past two nights. and it was cool. but I think I'm gonna have to stop now. I don't want anything to mess up this thing between me and the guy I really want. man, I'm in a good mood."

"event","Well it's Saturday night. and it wasn't such a bad one. spent time with friends, watched a movie, the notebook. it is a really good movie and I love it. but at the same time I don't love it because it makes me feel lonely. it makes me wish I had someone to love as strongly as allie loved noah. I guess at one time I did. and I wonder if I will ever get together with him again the way allie and noah did. probably not. I mean its probably better if we don't. I don't know. he called again. why? he knows. he always knows. if I'm with another guy, he knows, somehow he knows. and he calls. and it messes things up. I didn't answer but then I was thinking about him. and I shouldn't be thinking about him when I'm with another guy. the other guy I would like to talk about now. last night was wonderful. hehe I said wonderful. it was awesome. I had such a good time. we spent time together, it wasn't rushed, it was great. and I caught myself smiling on the way home. I was really happy. I'm still happy. it just felt so right. everything about it. this morning, he was the first thing I thought of when I woke up. how cheezy is that? but its true. and all I wanted to do was see him again. its crazy. I really like this guy. I hope everything works out. I hope I don't scare him away, and I hope I don't run away. I like him a lot, so its very probable that I will do one of those two but I'm going to try not to. cause I like him. one more time... I really like this guy."

"event","grr... why do boys have to be so stupid? huh? why? I am not here for your convenience. It is not fair that we can only be together when you're free, doesn't matter if I'm busy or not. why? For once, I'd like to be together when its convenient for me. Just once. One time when you're not in between classes or on your way to work. Some time when I've got plenty of free time and the time's not rushed. I hate being in a hurry. But no. that just doesn't work for you, doesn't fit into your schedule. Today you wanted to came by, so I got up from my much needed nap so you could. then I made you leave but said I would come by later. I had plenty of time, all the time in the world, but no, it wasn't a good time for you. why the hell not? Sure, I got a lot of work done and went to work out but I wanted to be with you. Don't you understand that? why don't you get that? So now I want to ignore you. Its not fun for me any more. I want to hang out on my time. no more of this running around on yours. screw you.
So the sleepover was kinda a bust. I guess girls are stupid too. or just plain mean. My parents went to a lot of trouble for this party and two people don't show, one leaves early (but she didn't really eat anyways because she had eaten before) and another comes late and doesn't eat because she had half a pizza. who eats half a pizza, especially when you know theres food waiting for you? thats so gay! and it makes me so angry. thats just really disrespectful to me and my parents. I'm not going to do this again. or if I do I'm only inviting three people, the three that didn't piss me off. grr. emily, my bestest friend in the whole world, is supposed to be calling me tonight to tell me about a new guy in her life. why can't I get a new guy? I'm so jealous of her sometimes. its just not fair. pity party of one."

"event","2 am... what an interesting time of day. I have discovered over time that I am the most honest at 2 am. I will say anything at 2 am, you can ask me anything, I will answer. I always say things I normally wouldn't say. its actually probably worse if someone calls and wakes me up. then I'll really say anything because I'm not actually conscious. so where is all this coming from? well I talked to him last night until 2 am. and at that point for some reason I felt the need to tell him all these things I've been writing in my journal. I told him that I like him, that I have liked him for a while, that I'm all confused inside. I can't remember exactly what his response was but thats because it wasn't some great response. it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. he just said his feelings had been changing for me too and that our relationship is starting to be more complex now. he said we're not in a good place or a bad place. well before he said that I thought we were in a good place but I guess not. I'm just so lost. what should I do? only God knows. wish he would tell me... =) gee whiz. I haven't talked to him today. I probably won't. which is ok. I don't know what I would say.
I watched American Dreams tonight. what a great show. I belong in that era. I wish I were Meg, living in the sixties. Some people may think that things are better now, but not me. I think things were simpler for girls back then. girls didn't have to go to college back then. They could just get married and have families. and thats what I want to do. sure its old fashioned but thats what I am. 
I told Jessica today that I would room with her next year. I think it will be good. we've had our differences in the past but I think it will be good. I might have to cut back on my tv habits. of course, I'd have to do that with anyone.
Me and Elvis had a fight tonight. I told him I wanted the house and the plane. He wouldn't go for it. I'll get him in court. Meanwhile, I'm just spending my time at the heartbreak hotel. Ah, only the lonely."

"event","well tonight was fun, I was surprised. me and kendra and madoline and rachel went to the new daisy and saw perspective and chosen view. they were really good. I wanna buy their cds. there were lots of Bolton people there, and that was kinda weird. I don't really like seeing people from high school any more, except my good friends of course. so moving on. I had decided to give up on him. I had decided that it just wasn't worth it, that I was wasting my time. he had ignored me all week. last night I tried talking to him, but again, ignoring. but tonight he's talking and now I'm all confused. I don't know what to do. I know I like him but I just don't know if I'm wasting my time. it seems like it. I think I'm just so lonely that its hard for me to figure things out. we're talking about love now. such a touchy subject. such a sore one for me. I've only been in love once, and for a while, it was awesome. but then it wasn't any more. so I'm not sure if I like love or not. I think I do. I want to give it another chance. lonely isn't any better. lonely sucks. and thats why I went to him. so do I want him or am I just lonely? I feel like I'm going in circles. I think if he liked me and wanted me then the decision would be easier. but its not that simple. I don't like where our conversation is going. he does not like me. I'm almost positive. and so now I'm unhappy. I should have just gone to bed. but no, I had to get online. he says its complicated. hey hes talking to the queen of complicated. the weird thing is that we're so much alike. but only I see it. I guess he'll never know."

"event","I am not in a good mood. And I should be, according to my schedule I'm supposed to be in good mood for another half a week. but I'm not. and its all his fault. he has the audacity to tell me he has been ignoring me because he hasn 't had time to fuck off. what the hell does that mean? seriously, that just pissed me off. I'm so glad thats all I'm worth to him. something for him to do when hes not too busy. FUCK! sorry, I just needed to do that. I hate this, I hate it so much. I don't want to be one of those girls. I don't want to be the kinda girl who cares when a guy doesn't call. this was supposed to be a casual thing, we were supposed to be friends. but I like him and so I want him to call, I want to be with him. It just isn't fair, not fair at all. Life sucks. I was so happy last week and now I'm just sad. On saturday night I went to his house and we watched Anchorman and it was sooo nice. he kept kissing me on the forehead or on the cheek and it was really sweet. it made me so happy. then he stops talking to me. I guess I'm just not good enough.
Guy who shall remain nameless hasn't called any more. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I should have known. But I guess in my deepest heart of hearts I wanted him to call. I wanted to talk to him, I was hoping he would want me again. but I guess not. I'm sure it will be another month before I will get a 2 am phone call. oh joy, can't wait.
This weekend will probably suck. Megan is going out of town and so I'm going to hang out with Kendra which is cool but I want to go to the New Daisy on Saturday and I'm sure no one will want to go. they never want to do anything if it involves me. I'm not exactly sure what I did to make everyone dislike me. must have been something real bad. maybe I'm just terrible at making and keeping friends. wow life does suck. this is some pity party."

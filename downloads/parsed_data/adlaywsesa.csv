"event","Ok this kid that i did like like a week ago is plannin on asking me out tonight but... my ex boyfriend David who Ive loved for like ever and ever sence we broke up... kinda has me changing my mind. Today in work he was acting all sweet like he used to always do befor we went out. But im not sure if hes doin it cause he wants play or maybe he likes me again or i really dont kno. I kno this other kid that was gana ask me out tonight likes me but im not all the interested in him. I dont feel convertable around him and i feel really weird. But ive said no to him twice already and dont really wana do it again. The only thing i wana know is if David actually cares about me or if he wants play."

Then i got the darkness song stuck in my dads head and he is mad... He tried killing me but i told him that i cannot die because i have super powers... Then he gave me a thousand dollars and said im sorry eric... And i said u better be now go buy me a car... So after he bought me a car i turned it into a rocketship and flew it to mars and started humping the mars rover... I am currently humping it now... Be sure to check out the pics on NASA....

Today is boring... Gym was boring as hell... We had to dribble up and down the court and pass all day... It was pathetic... Gym is starting to blow more and more... Anyway, I tried working on some new songs and shit but my brain is broked... For some reason i cant write new shit. I think im just tired of switching bands and switching types of music between metal, metalcore, death metal, and black metal, it sucks because each type of music calls for a different insruments, and different riffs and types of music... I dont know... And people really piss me off... alot

"event","Alright, alright, stuff has actually been happening and it's really time to report.

OLD NEWS:
1) I don't work at HMV anymore. Have I said that already? I'm not sure. Anyhow, job is gone. 'Twas the season for seasonal workers to be dismissed.

2) Kuri came and visited from New York for a week. We hung out with Crystal a lot. It was pretty rad, 'cause the three of us hadn't hung out together in a few years. Also, the Lesbians came and visited last weekend. We took cute sticker photos, but unfortunately my scanner doesn't work, so I'll have to wait and see if anyone else uploads them.

TRANSITION NEWS:
3) I've been on T for a year now! I do plan on making a T video at some point. Christ, I procrastinate the hell out of those, don't I?

4) I had my hysterectomy consultation last week. I don't think I'm gonna do it. I get pretty bad vibes from it all, and I feel like I would just end up feeling emptier rather than manlier. If I have to keep the F on my legal documents (which may or may not be the case), so be it.

THE REALLY SHITTY NEWS:
Oh man, you ready for this one? (The answer is no, by the way. I promise.)

Okay, so...right now there are two big Ts in our family. Mine is Testosterone. I lucked out.

5) My mom's big T is Terminal. Yep. Return Of The Cancer, Part 3: This Time It Means Business. The doctor guessed that she's got a year or two left, so she's been spending her time inhaling any vitamins, nutrients and positive energy she can get her hands on.

And you thought <i>your</i> day was shitty.

<lj-embed id=""26""/>
I've been handling it all in a very...""Oasis"" kind of way, I suppose. I've seen better days, but I don't care, 'cause I'm too busy being an Amanda Palmer fanboy. Denydenydeny.

PS: If you want to send some positive energy our way, by any chance, I'm sure mom would be mighty appreciative.

Me, on the other hand...well, if you have any clues on Who Killed Amanda Palmer, pass 'em my way."

"event","<u>20 Resolutions for 2009:</u>

1. Hang out with Crystal more. (This is fresh in my mind because I just saw her several days in a row after not really seeing her much at all for three or four years) (also because she is making me dinner tonight for the third time this week)
2. Make another film! Hell, make two! Or seventeen! (Tate? Katherine? You both wrote in my yearbook that I should call you up whenever I start a new film, and I am hella holding you to that.)
3. By December, try to have some kind of idea of what you're going to do with your life. Just a rough outline will do.
4. Get surgeries and possibly even legal document changes underway.
5. Use your new iPod wisely. Don't stop paying attention to the outside world.
6. Find--and quit losing--your mojo.
7. Also stop losing umbrellas.
8. Love.
9. Learn lots of new things. No school does not mean letting your brain die.
10. Be kind to strangers.
11. Keep writing with pens on a regular basis. (It sounds dumb, but I hate that lazy/painful/stupid feeling my hand gets when it uses a pen for the first time in a while)
12. Give people birthday presents. ""I'll buy you one later"" doesn't count because you always say that and don't follow it up. Asshole.
13. Wear makeup sometimes. Sure, it's girly, but you like makeup, and there's no shame in that.
14. Call people back. (Christ, sorry Caeli, I know you called me before Christmas and I still haven't gotten back to you. Work + Christmas + visitors from foreign lands = neglect of local friendships.)
15. Calm the fuck down.
16. Wear more hats. 2008 was a lame year for hats.
17. Find Tannis. (Where the hell is she? She could seriously be fucking dead and I would have no idea. Did she go to Japan without telling anyone again?)
17-b. Find Amanda Palmer. (This is less of a big deal than finding Tannis because I know she is actually alive and well, and that her disappearance is a made-up story to promote the Who Killed Amanda Palmer album. But still. I want to know what supposedly happened to her. Actually, Amanda's ""death"" kinda makes me more nervous about Tannis.)
18. Never let fear hold you back. (I think this has always been kind of an unofficial resolution of mine each year, but this time it's finally in writing.)
19. Go renew your L and learn how to fucking drive.
20. Have a drink on your 19th birthday like a true law-abiding Canadian."

I know I talk about the spiders in my basement a lot, so I figured I'd show you one in an attempt to explain my fury. I have killed more than <i>sixty</i> spiders in my basement this year. This is one of them. (Okay, only about five or six were this big. But STILL.)

I now work in the DVD section of that massive HMV on Robson. (It's got Vancouver's largest selection of DVDs, dontcha know.) I'm employed temporarily as Christmas help, and oh my God, I don't want to deal with angry Christmas shoppers. I just learned how to use the till last week.

My back and arms after ten months on T! Upper body strength? What're you doing on my body?

</lj-cut>
Yep. That was my October. Actually, I lie. That first photo is from September and the last two were taken about half an hour ago. October was really not that exciting at all.

<b>EDIT</b>: Oops, I lied again! In October, That's What She Said was one of the finalists in the Reel Youth Film Festival, and screened at two theatres as part of the Vancouver International Film Festival! Woo! And what's even cooler is that one of the places it was screened was the Vancity Theatre, and after the films were shown, the filmmakers (myself included) went down to the front and answered audience questions.

Y'know what happened the first time I went to the Vancity Theatre? <a href=""http://badumpsh.livejournal.com/88132.html"">I saw John Cameron Mitchell talking about <i>his</i> film</a>! I'm already following the footsteps of my favourite director! Eee!"

"event","<lj-cut text=""This is me talking about porn and stuff. I've cut it just in case now isn't really the best time."">

I've been thinking a lot about sex on film recently, and I've realized that if I were given an opportunity to film any kind of scene with sex in it, I would have no fucking clue where to even start. To help me sort out my own thought process, I'm opening my question up to all of you: How do <i>you</i> like to see sex on a screen? Do you like porn? What kind of porn do you like? What kinds of shots are turn-ons or turn-offs for you? Do you prefer to watch sex when it's more driven by plot and character development than sexual desire (think Shortbus), or does that just ruin it for you? Do you like it best when it's done like a PG-13 film and you can't really see anything that's happening? What completely ruins a good sex scene for you? What's your favourite part of sex to watch (foreplay, stripping, penetration, orgasm, whatever)? Is animation a yay or a nay? (There's no pressure to stick to these questions, by the way. I'm just trying to give you somewhere to start.)

I'm curious about enjoyment levels of all sorts, so if you like watching plot-driven, PG-13 sex most, but it doesn't turn you on at all, that's good to know too.

<b>Jessie's contribution, to keep things fair:</b>
-I like it when people giggle and fuck things up during sex. A lot. I just watched Art School Sluts by Eon McKai a few nights ago (that's where the quote in my subject header thing came from) and I absolutely loved it, simply because he left in a bunch of shots where you can see them reading off of scripts, or asking him questions, or having trouble finding someone's vagina. It makes the sex so much more real, and I can relate to it better.
-I find penetration shots to be reeeeally boring to watch. It usually goes on for ages, too.
-For some reason, I really really don't like shots of girls giving blowjobs. 
-I like watching kisses, but only when they're actual kisses and not just tongues licking tongues. 
-I don't like it when anyone looks into the camera at all, because it makes it feel too much like they're performing for the viewer's sake and not actually enjoying it themselves. 
-I think that talking dirty gets super ridiculous once it starts getting repetitive. ""Suck that cock"" really starts to lose its meaning after you've said it twelve times. 
-I really like gay porn. It's odd, considering the fact that I don't find guys particularely attractive and I don't like penetration shots, but I think that when I'm...yeah, okay, I've formed this train of thought properly now. XD If I'm looking to watch a good sex scene, then I want to watch hot girls make out and have fun, pretty sex. If I just want some porn to get off to, I prefer gay porn with guys I really don't find all that attractive. I find that gay porn with older, overweight, hairy men tends to be more enthusiastic and earnest than other porn. I dig it. As an added bonus, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S-xBKkAr3s&feature=related"">here's</a> a clip of Margaret Cho and Violet Blue discussing how awesome gay porn is.

Oh geez, my body just informed me RIGHT NOW that I did not get enough sleep last night and that it is now time to be tired again. Time to either go sleep for a couple more hours or wake myself up a bit.

EDIT: <a href=""http://eonmckai.com/video/Porno101.mov"">Here's</a> a quick example of Eon McKai's film style. This is him experimenting with actually writing the dirty-talk himself. I'm not sure if this is actually from one of his full-length porn films or not, but it's a clip of two girls rehearsing a strap-on scene with their underwear on and scripts in hand. It's kind of long, and the dialogue is ridiculous, but it's cute to listen to them giggle about it once they're through the script."

Remember the <a href=""http://badumpsh.livejournal.com/59232.html"">spiders of 2006</a>?

Well, my spider problems are over. I have killed at least 34 spiders in my basement this year, and I have yet to receive a SINGLE spider bite. REVENGE IS MINE!!!

2)Food
If you find yourself over at my house in the next while and I say that I have no food to feed you, trust me. I am not just hoarding it all for myself. <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/IMG_7587.jpg"">Here's my proof</a>. (Unless you really, really like jam.)

3) Seattle
I went to Seattle last week and had myself some good times. It wasn't terribly eventful, so I shall list some highlights in point form. (Wow, I can't remember the order that things happened in at all. No chronological order for you!)

-actually driving down in a friend's car for the first time ever
-the border crossing guard trying to send us off without giving us our passports back until Hope asked ""...Do we need our passports?""
-arriving at Helene's apartment mid-dance party
-being introduced to cream of wheat (and cream of wheat with chocolate chips!)
-watching Serenity with Hope, Liz, Ashley and Micaila
-sleeping on Hope's couch in its couch form even though it folds out into a bed, simply because it felt more like I was traveling that way
-going to the park by myself and writing the beginning of the shittiest script ever
-sitting in the bathroom with Micaila as she took a bubble bath and helped me come up with a new script idea that didn't suck
-deciding that I should not direct a film where Ashley has sex with Micaila while Helene plays a cheezy sax solo and then Emily comes in out of nowhere to fix something (it would've been called ""Triple Ex,"" even though there are technically four of us including me)
-Ashley buying delicious cookies and then letting me eat some
-many long walks up and down Broadway with Micaila
-naps!
-Micaila scoring a new job at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with a 90-second phone conversation
-watching Teeth and the Utena movie
-the way the lady at Blockbuster described Teeth as an ""um...<i>amusing</i>"" film
-the awesome waitress at IHOP who figured out how Micaila and I could save money
-going out for lunch with Chelsea
-attempting to bust into Tannis's apartment (no luck)
-planning to protest outside of Tannis's building with signs saying things like ""CALL ME, TANNIS!""
-trying to use T9 for my text messages, then giving up because Micaila, Stephanie, ass and cuntface weren't in the dictionary
-that awesome pasta that Micaila made
-Micaila having internet access in her apartment

I feel like I'm forgetting a lot of stuff. Oh well. I remember plenty of good times.

"event","Maura and I broke up a couple of days ago. I didn't mention it in the Seattle post because I wasn't sure if she was okay with people knowing yet. In short: Yes, we're still friends; yes, it was my fault; no, it wasn't because of the open relationship; no, I'm not feeling particularly chatty about it. 

I don't know how to use semicolons properly, so I'm sorry to the grammar-types if I misused them. Kayla gets first dibs on correcting me because she has the semicolon tattoo."

Actual entry:
I just went to Seattle for a WHOLE WEEK. I haven't done that since Spring Break of Grade 10. Now, I have some ridiculously well-kept handwritten journal entries about my trip, but really, a lot of it is basically ""Me and these people went here and then we went back to someone's apartment and then we got hungry and got food and then we went back to that apartment and then went to someone else's apartment,"" so I figure I'll spare you the super-summary and just get on with the pictures.

I spent the first night hanging out with Hope, Ashley, Helene...

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/?action=view&current=IMG_6695.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/IMG_6695.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
...And Micaila. Everyone was very cold in this cafe except for me (I even ordered a milkshake), which is why Micaila is wearing my jacket. Not much happened that night.

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/?action=view&current=IMG_6702.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/IMG_6702.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
On Day 2, Zak (Zac? Zach? Zack?) kept picking flowers for Micaila. While most of them went in her hair, several of them found their way into this super cute teapot. The settings of the second day included Glo's (an all-day breakfast place), Red Light, and Value Village.

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/?action=view&current=IMG_6725.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/IMG_6725.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Micaila owns this belt, and I have tried everything in my power to borrow it from her. This photo was taken when she was not home and therefore unable to take it back from me.

On day 3, Helene gave me a tour of Pike Place Market and the Waterfront-type areas of Seattle while Micaila was at work. This is her standing next to a giant pylon. (She's half an inch shorter than me! Finally, a white person who isn't taller than I am!) After that, we met up with Micaila under the Space Needle, shopped a bit, and watched Requiem For a Dream. It was really sad and made us cry.

And on the Fourth Day, Stephanie came up from Bonney Lake to hang out with me.

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/?action=view&current=IMG_6735.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/IMG_6735.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Steph and I spent the day with Hope. We went to The Grill, her friend Sam's apartment, Babeland, Swedish Hospital, Sally's, Westlake Mall, Metro, and some girl's apartment.

We also met this guy named Lipstik, who spotted us from across the street and ran to meet us, nearly getting hit by a car on the way. (And yes, he said that he identifies as a he. I swear I'm not an insensitive ass.)

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/?action=view&current=IMG_6740.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/IMG_6740.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Lipstik's friend Graphic took this photo and the last photo. (That's Hope's friend Elizabeth on the left. She met up with us at Westlake Mall.)

Also: On this day, Micaila gave me a T shot, and it was a terrifying experience that Helene captured on film. I will probably upload it as a T video, because I seriously haven't done a single video in a month.

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/?action=view&current=IMG_6742.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/IMG_6742.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
That night, Micaila put a bandana on her kitty, and it was cute.

On Day 5, we watched Batman Begins on Helene's laptop and The Dark Knight in theatres. Good stuff.

Day 6 was July 19, which was Goddamn Lesbian Angst Day!

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/?action=view&current=IMG_6764.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/IMG_6764.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
We gathered as many Lesbians as we could for the occasion.

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/?action=view&current=IMG_6760.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/IMG_6760.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Tannis lives all of a block away from Micaila, so we all called and texted her fanatically hoping she would cross the street and come over.

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/?action=view&current=IMG_6752.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/IMG_6752.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Unfortunately, she was not home, and so we had no such luck.

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/?action=view&current=IMG_6768.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/Squirky/Seattle%20July%2008/IMG_6768.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
On the final day, we went to American Apparel and Urban Outfitters, and then I went to Canada.

Micaila and I spent a lot of time at Helene's.

Later, Stephanie and I took photos with her cell phone.

Maura: That was the most spazztastic paragraph ever.

Jessie: Oh, now Maura's typing, and that makes me a liar. Oh well. Okay, so, like, time for the point. Maura and I have decided that we are now in an open relationship, so if you see one of us with somebody else, it does not mean that we have broken up or that one of us is cheating on the other.

There are a hundred million of these on Facebook, but I haven't gotten around to taking those on quite yet, so here are eight.

This is my ""Shit shit I'm going to be late to the dinner dance"" face. And yes, that's me coloring my nails black with a sharpie. I faced some ridiculous trouble with nail polish that day. I hadn't painted my nails in so long that I had actually forgotten how to do it.

Maura and me outside her house. I tried to match her outfit as well as I could without showing up in a purple suit.

After the dance, Ms. Clark asked if anyone wanted any of the balloons. Brianne said yes and took them ALL.

Jump ahead to the grad ceremony! My posse included raised-me-dad Jamie, bio-dad Karl, Karl's wife Tammy, and best-bud-behind-the-camera Micaila.

Heeheehee, Micaila came!! It was supposed to be a surprise, but unfortunately I accidentally found out about three hours before she got to Canada. My mom couldn't come to the ceremony 'cause she's in the hospital, so she wanted to replace herself with the most similar person she could think of.</lj-cut>

3) Movies!
I made movies, and you should watch them.

<lj-embed id=""19""/>
CANCER KILLER FILM
This one's about my mommy. I made it for the Sunset Video Festival, and I won! Well...I was the only one who submitted a film, but I still won! I threw this together in about four days, if that.

<lj-embed id=""20""/>
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID (part 1)
This is My Big Film. I worked so hard on this one. Unfortunately, it's 15 minutes long in total, so I had to break it up into two parts.

<lj-embed id=""21""/>
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID (part 2)

4) T Recs!
I actually uploaded ALL of my videos! I think that embedding them all would probably be too much for most computers, so I'm just going to put links to them all. That's right, all of them. Even the ones I posted already.

If you don't want to watch each video individually, I do have this quick recap-type version where I basically say ""Alright, so, this is me __ weeks on T"" twenty times. No, seriously. I start off with ""Alright, so,"" almost every single time.

<i>April 14th, 2008

To whom it may concern,

Jessie Anderson has been in my Film Production class for two years. During these two years she has shown exceptional talent in making documentaries and short fiction films with little supervision.

Jessie is a mature student for whom film is a medium to not only entertain but also to educate. She ha a natural talent for framing well her subjects and for filming in general. She is also an excellent editor. She understands very well the concept of pace, rhythm and continuity. Jessie uses film as an artist uses paint, to express her own concerns and to explore contemporary issues relevant to her or her peers while trying to put the most interesting images on the screen. Everything she does she does it in a thoughtful manner.

Jessie has made her films almost all by herself including writing, filming, directing and editing. She has around her a good group of students who act in her films and who trust her abilities and her serious interest in filmmaking. Jessie has the intellect, attitude, talent and determination to become a successful artist who will make us look at the world around us with different eyes and a different perspective. And this will be a good thing.

My film won an award, yo! It got ""Best Performances"" at some film festival consisting of a bunch of lower mainland high school films. If my computer really loved me, I could upload it and post it here. But what I WILL do is post some ads that the Youth Panel made to advertise Youth Week, with the help of Telus' lovely cameras and fancy editing suites. (The one that Maura and I worked on unfortunately didn't get posted because of a bunch of dumb dumb things, but we worked on that end montage-y bit with Maya and a Telus editor man.)

So, uh, Kayla-Sarah-Grace? Because we've hung out as a group about two or three times in the past year or so, I was thinkin' that maybe we could try to organize another themed movie night. 'Cause, like, I miss ya. Right now, I'm thinkin' greaser films. Rebel Without A Cause? Oh, I think so."

However, it's got dumb little acts between the scenes. They might be cool on their own, but mixed with Twelfth Night...it's dumb. And there's a group of choral speakers who represent the characters' thoughts sometimes. Um. But the acting parts aren't too bad. I'm in it. I play Orsino, and I'm the assistant director (translation: I direct the actual acted scenes, and then Ms. Orr gives her ""artsy"" input and makes the play...different). Don't come opening night. We've rehearsed the finale maybe three or four times in total so far.  Oh, and as an extra bonus sneak peek of how special our drama department is, I'm going to type out our initial poster just for you, exactly as it's written! (We've gotten better ones since, but Ms. Orr decided to write some up and post them first without telling anybody.)

<i><b>Van Tech's Theatre Program
presents our spring production of

OR WHAT YOU WILL</b>
An adaptation of Shakespeare's Comedy Twelfth Night with a

of
mask......dance.......percussion......choral.........
a song..............
a tear
and lots of laughs

<b>Where:</b>
The recently renovated Auditorium at Vancouver Technical
Secondary School. 2600 east broadway (front entrance)

<b>The Play</b>
Viola lives as a man and loves a man, who thinks she's a man but she is a
woman, but he loves Olivia and Olivia loves Viola..........In the end they all
love who they want and get love in return..........Viola even finds someone
she loves and didn't think she would ever see again........
This gender bender twist will take you on a journey of hidden
identities......Originally Shakespeare had no woman on stage, in our show
there are many.......see if you can tell who are the real woman and the real
men!</i>

How someone can ignore spell check and the English language that hard, I don't know.

On a more positive note, I did my first self-injection last Friday! Now I can pump my body full of manjuice in the comfort of my own home!!

On an even MORE positive note, I'm almost done my latest film! I'm super proud of it because it's the first film I've really done all on my own. And, like, people are actually gonna see it. That's exciting. ^_^"

I mean, she was around 15 years old, but she sure didn't seem like an old cat, and then she went and stopped drinking or something and let herself get really really really dehydrated. By the time we saw her and rushed her to the hospital, it would've cost up to $7000 to give her a small chance of survival. We had to put her down. She was almost totally still and could barely breathe until that injection got in her body. Once she felt it, she started howling and kicking and fighting it as hard as she could. It was really hard to watch. Maura happened to be visiting while this happened, and even she cried, even though she hardly even knew her.

We're going to bury her tomorrow. Right now she's sitting upstairs in a cardboard box. Weeird.

The quick summary involves hairy legs, a persistent hint of that gorgeous prepubescent mustache, very minor ups and downs in my voice and, um, sensitive areas getting more sensitive than before. I have heard from others that my face and walk have gotten manlier, though I don't think T affects my walk.

Alright, so now the bad news. Like, really bad news. Mom had some lumps in her chest and had a biopsy done to check them out, and the results came in today stating that she has Hodgkin's Lymphoma for the second time. The doctors have told her that getting the same cancer twice is not exactly promising for one's survival, so while my mom plans on fighting like nobody's business, it's not unlikely that she will die from this. It's been very difficult to stay optimistic, because while we may smile and say that she'll get through this, we're also trying to tidy up any loose ends that would lead to me having a disaster to deal with if she didn't make it. Wills are being written. Finances are being discussed. Karl has agreed to move to Vancouver to help me pay rent and find homes for all six of our cats and whatnot. It's weird, 'cause while I'll have 1-2 fathers trying to help, I'll still feel like an orphan. My mom is pretty much my only family. All grandparents either don't really like me, treated my mom like shit or live in Tennessee. Just...fuck. I wish I had time to work, 'cause right now I just really want to get some money coming in. I've been fucked over enough times, and I'd like to regain at least a bit of control."

There's a chance, of course, that my therapist is totally swamped with work and will not be able to send my report in time for that, and so my appointment will have to be postponed, but that seems unlikely because her top priority is to help people like myself, and she mentioned that this could happen when she said I could book my appointment.

Eeeeeeee omgggg!  I need to have my T party soon, you guys!  Aaahhhh!!!"

"event","Look guys, a sex-plus-other-stuff survey that isn't even written by me!

<lj-cut text=""Warning: There are tales of my sex life within."">
1. Is there anyone on your friends list you would ever consider having sex with?
Um, considering everyone I've ever had sex with is on my friends list, I'd say yes.

2. Sex in the morning, afternoon, or night?
Night, and then again first thing in the morning.

3. What side of the bed do you sleep on?
I generally sleep on the outside, but I'm flexible.

4. Pork, beef, or chicken?
Hmm...chicken, I guess.

5. Have you ever had to pull over on the side of the road to puke?
Nope.

6. Have you ever taken your clothes off for money?
Nope!

7. Shower or bath?
Shower. My bathtub is way too small for me.

8. Do you pee in the shower?
Hellsyeah!  It's the only time I can pee standing up without making an awful mess.

9. Mexican or Chinese?
Chinese.  I live in Vancouver, yo.

10. Do you want someone aggressive or passive in bed?
Why the hell would I want someone passive in bed?

11. Do you love someone on your friends list?
Mmhmm ^_^

12. Do you know all the people on your friends list?
Most of 'em.

13. Love or money?
Love, all the way.

14. Credit cards or cash?
I heart cash.  It's no fun to roll around in a pile of credit cards.

15. Has there ever been anyone in your family you wish wasn't?
Um, well, anyone I've had a problem with is no longer really part of my family, so not anymore, no.

16. Would you rather go camping or to a 5 star hotel?
Eww, camping.  Hotel, please.

17. What is the weirdest place you have had sex?
I feel like I should have a more exciting answer for this one, but I think the best I can come up with is either on my too-tiny couch while my friends were sleeping in the next room or leaning against my giant body-sized freezer.  Clearly I just think oddly-sized furniture and appliances are silly.

18. Would you shave your entire body (including your head) for money?
Depends how much money we're talking.  Mind you, I look rather silly with a shaved head.

19. Have you ever been to a strip club?
Nope.

20. Ever been to a bar?
Um, not really.  I've been to a couple of those restaurants that seem like they're mostly-bar.

21. Ever been kicked out of a bar or a club?
Nope. I'm a good kid.

22. Ever been so drunk you had to be carried out of somewhere?
I've never been so drunk that I got tipsy.

23. Kissed someone of the same sex?
Eww, that's disgusting.  And by that I mean yes, I totally have.

24. Favorite drink?
Chocolate milk can be so, so good sometimes.

25. Had sex in a movie theater?
'Fraid not.  I don't think I'd want to miss the movie...

26. Had sex in a bathroom?
I've had sex in showers, so yes.

27. Have you ever had sex at work?
Haha, no XD

28. Have you ever been in an ""adult"" store?
I have!

29. Bought something from an adult store?
Indeed I have.

30. Have you been caught having sex?
No, and I've had sex with someone while she was on the phone before, so that ""no"" is pretty impressive.  Or not, I guess, on my part...but we'll ignore that logic for now.  Shut up I'm good in bed!

31. Does anyone have naughty pics of you?
Umm...I don't think so.  Micaila has photos of me only wearing pants and a tensor bandage, but I think that's as scandalous as it gets.

32. Have you ever had sex with someone and called them the wrong name?
I don't think so, no XD

33. Who do you think has the guts to repost this?
Most people I know."

"event","I had a really awesome New Year's Eve!  I stumbled my way to Fiona's house (I foolishly took a new route in the dark and didn't think to bring the address) and hung out with Maura, Fiona, Jeremiah, Virginia, Emily, Olivia, Sam and Aly.  We started off the evening being RIDICULOUSLY artsy (there were three digital SLR cameras, one video camera, a guitar, facepaints and books all being used at the same time), then sauntered down to The Drive to look for food.  Our countdown happened at a bus stop, and there was much rejoicing.  Then when we got back to Fiona's, we played a few variations of truth-or-dare style games, then fell into an AMAZING discussion about sex and sexuality and gender and all that good stuff from about 2:00am to 7:00am.  (I kind of wish I'd filmed it, but I think that would have ruined the momentum of the conversation.)  Maura came back to my house and we crashed from 8:30am to 5:30pm.

Oh, and I did something I'm mighty proud of at work the other day.  I was assigned to the Kids' section, see, and I went to the Reference: Ages 9-12 shelves and found a bunch of nicely displayed books on how preteen girls can shop for the right cosmetic type stuff and how they can tell if the boy likes them, etc.  I took those books and tucked them away on the bottom shelf, replacing them with a lovely display of books about puberty and periods and such.  Sure enough, a few seconds after I walked away, I saw a girl flipping through them.  I contributed to my community, yo.  Oh, and Virginia said that her and Fiona are looking into how to become sex educators, and they offered to let me in on that action, which would be AWESOME.

<lj-cut text=""But enough about me. Onto the photos!"">

I need to look like this more.  Part of this means that I should have nice hair always, and part of this means that I need more amazing binders like the one I'm wearing here, but it mostly means that I need to film a LOT more than I already am.  Too many precious memories have been wiped from my mind, and that's not cool."

It is snowing like mad, and her house is a 45 minute walk from mine.  The crazy girl almost rode her bike here.  Oh, and she has a terrible cold.

She makes me giddy. A little nervous for her safety, but giddy nonetheless. ^_^"

<i>guess what i'm updating from?


my brand fucking new macbook.

oh yeah, i cant believe it either.</i>

And then I scrolled down a bit and saw this:

<i>I am, at present, updating from my brand new laptop. Woot woot.</i>

At this point, I would just like to point out the fact that I got my laptop in grade 6, so nyeah, fuck you all, I still win.

...I would not like to point out the fact that my laptop now shuts down as soon as I unplug it after months of charging, makes frightening churning noises on occasion, closes programs unexpectedly and is the slowest running thing since boulders could be tied to turtles.  Whatever, yo.  My 27GB harddrive can totally kick your ass."

"event","Wow, have I ever been getting a lot of surveys filled out!  I have 25 so far, and I'm having so much fun reading them.  Thanks, everyone!

Christmas was pretty quiet this year, as I celebrated it with only mom this year (I'm used to the house having at least four people in it every year).  Quiet as it may have been, I got me a couple bitchin' presents.

(Just so you know, one of the two presents I'm about to show off is one my my new binders, which just so happens to be shaped like a sports bra.  Therefore, if you do not want to see any naked flesh in the general tummy area, this may just be TOO MUCH FOR YOU TO HANDLE.)

<lj-cut text=""ZOMG PRESENTS!"">

These binders are from Taiwan, yo!  I got a medium white one for my birthday, but it didn't bind very well, so I got one small black one and a small white one for Christmas.  I've definitely never had a more effective binder.  It's a little trickier to breathe than usual, yes, but just look at that flat chest!

My mom also got me this AMAZING mic that could not look any more intense and professional if it tried.  I love carrying it around because it makes me feel pretty fuckin' fancy.

Happy Holidays, y'all!"

"event","Guys, I'm so stressed out!  I've been trying to ignore all the shit going on in my head, but my body's actually starting to get rather angry at me for that kind of thing.  I feel nauseous all the time, I can't sleep, I have nightmares when I can sleep, etc.  I just don't have any time to even acknowledge scholarships, and I know due dates are slipping by.  I just found out from Dr. Preece last week that I need to get a hysterectomy in order to change my sex on my legal documents.  Fuuuuckzorz.  Everybody thinks Ms. Orr is on crack about our school play (Tate even gave up on auditioning because he hates what we're doing to poor Twelfth Night), and it's so hard to motivate myself to direct a shit play.  I was originally so excited about it, too, because I fucking LOVE Twelfth Night, but I really, really don't want to be responsible for fucking it up.  Work is somehow finding a way to consume my brain, which is ridiculous because I don't really do anything at work.  I need to catch up on a test and an essay that I just really want to ignore forever and ever.  Oh, and Portfolio/Transition Plan?  Fuck that shit, I'm handing in my goddamn gender transition plan.  That oughta be worth eight times what the grad transition plan is worth.

At least I did really well on my report card.  My lowest marks (nothing lower than a B, 'cause I rock) are actually all in my theatre courses, 'cause I never show up.  My best grades, however, include 91% in Lit, 97% in AP English, and 100% in CPTV.  Woo!

If anyone sees me in person, you should hug me.  Hugs are good.

EDIT: I just found EIGHTY FUCKING DOLLARS in my pocket!  How fucking awesome is that?  My day wasn't so bad after all!"

nothing much new... me & the baby are doing great :)  I go today for my prenatal check up... get to hear her heartbeat ..hehe... i love going to these appointments just for that reason :)  she will be here soon..... i'm in love with her already and  cant wait to hold her... this is still very unreal to me, like it has to take her to kick for me to realize i'm pregnant.. thats how weird it is still to me, because me and my baby's father couldn't get pregnant for 3 years.. so i never thought it would happen.. and thats why its like a dream to me....  i know once she is actually here its still going to seem like a dream... its just one of those things i have wanted for SO long, so it is the best gift i have ever gotten in my whole life.


anyways, let me go get ready for my appointment..

"event","the easter bunny came for me and alexia!! :) he brought me a whole huge thing of jelly bellies (my fave!) and he brought alexia the cutest pink bib, and 2 tops and a hand print tin, so i can get her hand print and have it forever :) awwwwies.. thanks easter bunny aka..aunt laura. ;)

so, yesterday was a hectic but fun day :) the whole family came over for easter and as usual.. it was a good time besides the fact that my cousin got into a blow out with her man...(and then they made up 5 mins later) isnt that how it always happens in relationships?? lol... we had my grandma's famous lasangna and it was PERFECT! she is my all time fave cook and that was the first time she cooked for the family in a long time.. everyone loved it... we also had lamb which my aunt made and that was so good too... i ate like a pig yesterday butttt i'm allowed! hahaha. 

today I have a prenatal checkup appt..(can't wait to hear her heartbeat again!) teehee... hmmmm what else, what else.... we got the baby shower invitations the other day, I am so excited about that... a whole day dedicated to my baby :) it couldn't get any better than that... i am doing it different then the traditional baby shower... it's actually going to be like a family get together/ baby shower, since i am having the shower on memorial day weekend...so all the family is invited and then some friends who I hope will come like my best friend of like 5 years (marita)... that would be nice.


anyways, i think that is it for now.. :)

"event","ok seriously, I am dyingggggggggg!  look how cute that dress it!!! right when I saw it I knew I had to put my little boo in it! hehe...  it's still so unreal to me that I am going to have a precious little girl with me in 3 months, I can't wait for her to get here... I just wish time would go faster!!!! .. I still can't believe I am almost 6 months pregnant already, I remember the day I found out like it was yesterday.... time really does fly.  anyways, nothing else is really new.. my aunt is having a baby shower for me the end of may, so I am excited for that... and this sunday (for easter) we are having a family get together..(i love those!)  our family always has the most fun... it's great... we are crazy :]  ummmmz... what else... I have a prenatal check up this monday, so I get to hear my boo's heartbeat again! yay, I love that!! NOTHING compares to the sonogram, but the listening to the heartbeat is pretty damn amazing too . anyways, I guess that's it for now... I don't update often cause nothing much changes from day to day.. it's more like month to month ;] laterzzzzz, xo.

"event","Alexia Jean Caroline  : )  awwwwww!!!!  most people are going to call her Lexi for short... and so most of you know the reason we are giving her 2 middle names, it's because we couldnt agree on 1 and because we are naming our daughter after 2 women we adore most... Jean is my Grandmother who I adore more than anything... and Caroline is Alex's Grandma and he was so close to her and loved/loves her so much ..may she rest in peace. 


anyways, I am so tired... I lost a lot of sleep this past week... I went out a lot and I handled it better than I thought... there were some points I thought I was just going to pass out and thats when I would sit down somewhere and just chill.. lol but i dont reccomend any preggo girls staying out till 4 am.. especially when you can't drink!!!!!! haha, I felt so left out I was the only one not drinking.. but it's for a good reason so I really didnt care :) I had fun regardless...  I love vacations :) although my whole life is like one big vacation, lol... but once Alexia arrives, thats all going to change...so I'm not getting so used to this easy life shit.. haha.

ok well, today is my little cousins B-day, she turns 3.. (she is the cutest!) so I'm going to go help clean and set up for her party..  I will keep you all updated with everything :)

I saw her scratch her head it was the cutest thing! she is pretty stubborn (she takes after daddy) hehe.. everytime the doc wanted a full profile shot she would bury her head under, lol... I can't wait to meet her on July 31st...or sooner (hopefully) I thank god for her. I was praying for a healthy little girl and he answered my prayers... :)

I am so excited and nervous at the same time, because I really want to know what I am having.. and a lot of the time they can't tell you... and I can only get ONE level 2 sono... so i'm very nervous =/  I know in the end all's that matters is having a healthy baby and of course thats all i really care about, but I reallllyyyy want to know if it's a boy or girl. :)  anyways, my tummy has gotten SO BIG! it's so amazing... sometimes I look at it and I'm like, ew... but then I'm like.. theres a baby in there!!!! and it just makes me smile :)

"event","ok well.. each day I wake up I seem to be growing more and more.. it's scary but at the same time it's amazing knowing I have a life growing inside of me.. I can't wait to start feeling the baby kick and move around.. I will probably cry! Tomorrow I go to see the nutritionist and then my big sonogram is on the 13th of march, can't waitttttttt. so the month of march is going to be pretty busy for me.. I have a few doctors appointments and we have a family get together for Jilly's Bday... so march is going to be busy and fun :) Thank god cause time goes faster when your busy and I want time to go fast so my baby can be here already!!! I wantttt my baby now! lol.

anyways, there is nothing else really new.. me and my baby's father are pretty set on names for the baby.. the girl name was the one we had a hard time with.. but i think we finally came to a desicion and the name will be Lexie Jean...  Jean is my grandmothers name :) so I thought having her name as the middle name would be cute... and Lexie is so cute and isn't very common and thats what we were going for.. uncommon names.. of course if it's a boy Alexander is pretty common, but we both want a Jr... and I have always loved the name Alex anyway.. so it works out great :)
        

ummm what elseeee...  I don't think there is anything else new with me, I will let you all know the deal with the doctors tomorrow and of course I will let you know the deal on the 13th! PRAYYYYYY they can tell what the baby is.. I really want to know :)

I never thought I would actually miss FL..  but it is fine because I am planning on moving back here soon.. hopefully before the baby is born but I don't like to plan shit anymore, I figure whatever is meant to happen will happen.. so patience is real important when it comes to shit like this... :) I know what's meant to be in my heart.. but now fate just needs to take it's course.

anyways, last night was nice.. me and my mom got a room at the Stirling Suites right off Stirling rd...the place is fucking NICE!! shame we were only there for one night.. my mom wound up going to my uncle sonny's house last night for dinner with all the family, but I didn't really feel up to going, plus I had better plans ;) teehee.  today me and danielle went out to lunch, it was good.. we were so starving when we got there so we ate like pigs :) I have been having sucha appitite lately it's scary! thank god I love health food, or else this pregnancy would turn me into a whale! heh

anyway..I had such an amazing time, at first I didn't think I was going to get to see anyone I wanted to see.. but I wound up seeing everyone which was really nice, because even though I plan on moving back, I don't know exactly when that will be.. so it's good I got to see everyone... :)

I didn't think I was over reacting when I deleted her and all her friends off of my myspace friends list.. I figure, I have people on there who are my true friends and none of her friends are really MY friends... I have met them all once, whoopdie doo... maybe I should'nt have deleted Jackie and I'm sure I will add her again soon, but I was just so mad at her for ignoring me and acting like I didn't exsist as soon as she got to FL.  I know I have always been there for her.. I remember when she had nothing to eat, me and Alex sent her western union to get food.. I care about her and will always be there for her no matter what, but sometimes I wonder if same goes for her, because right now I would say.. it doesnt. She's a good kid and I wish nothing but the best for her..

But the middle name is going to be ""Celia"" no matter what, it's 100% italian and I LOVE IT! it's not common at all and that's what I like...

I'm not good at figureing out what dreams mean.. never have been.. but that was a pretty weird ass dream if you ask me!  on a good note, I had a boy and girl.. how perfect :)  hehe.

I know that everything is going to work out how they are SUPPOSED to.. because no one can change fate or destiny.. i know in my heart what is meant to be and what is supposed to be.. and if fate & destiny are real...(which I believe they are)  then everything will turn out perfect :)

Tonight my Grandmother is taking us out to this really really high class steak place  in west hampton..(so good) I have been there once before and it is PRICEY but gooood. Me, Mom, Neil, Aunt Laura and Nan are going.. should be a good time with the old folks..lol. ;)  My sister jackie just left for Florida.. she might be staying down there for good.. I just wish her the best in whatever decision she makes...

ok, well.. I better go clean and shower and all that fun shit...  xoxoxo."

"event","my birthday is in 5 days :) I am going to be an old woman!  feels that way, I never thought I would be having a baby at age 23... then again with the way me and alex were actually trying to have this baby, I guess I can say I did expect it in a way ;) so many changes are going on with my body it's scary.. but I have known for a while I was going to have to deal with all the extra shit that comes along with having an angel.. all the pain in the ass symptoms, blah. but it will all be worth it in the end, when the cutest kid ever is born :)  

hmmm, what's new... nothing really, same old drama and BS that seems to follow me no matter where I move to/live... pretty funny actually. Alex is still pretty much getting threatened if he talks to me (getting kicked out of his house, and loosing his phone)  yea it blows my mind that he is being treated the way he is because of talking to the mother of his unborn child and someone who has been there for him through EVERYTHING... wow you think his mother would respect the fact that I was helping her son for 3 years stay out of jail & did nothing but love and take care of him.. nope, it's not like that.. of course it's a personal issue here, because she doesn't like me.. alex is basically suffering ( that's love? )  and his wife also hates the fact that he talks to me which is finneeeeee, cause at least I can say I NEVER got mad at him when he had to talk to her for the kids sake and I never told him not to talk to her.. oh wait, I know why... I didn't feel threatened by her at all, maybe that's why I didn't care if he did or not... but the more they get mad at him for talking to me, the more  I laugh, because it's so immature and fucking idiotic..  I look at it this way, they can't control him forever (hold shit over his head, threaten him, ect..) it's funny I don't even need to be in a serious relationship with him to be happy, just having him in my life is enough.. we have been through way to much to just let that go..PLUS we made a baby together, a baby that was PLANNED... no mistakes here..so he will be in this kids life, and no I won't hold this kid over his head or not let him see the kid if he doesn't pay child support, that's not me.. I just want him to be in the kid's life and i know he wants to be in it... no matter what he tells anyone, I know the truth...  as far as i'm concered i'm a threat and ppl are afraid i'm going to steal alex away again, haha grow up.. we will always be in eachothers lives whether certian people like it or not.. and if you're that worried about me talking to alex and being in his life, then.. you need to get over it, because if alex didnt want me in his life he would have shut me out and kept me out, he's the one who invited me back into his life.. he didn't have to if he was ""oh so happy"" with his new life, but he did...  so stop blaming me for shit when I would have still been moving on with my life if he never came back into mine.

P.S. keep making him tell me shit & keep threatning him if he talks to me... blah blah.. I know the truth NO MATTER WHAT happens.. I know his heart and I know how he feels deep down, and I frankly dont give a shit about who reads this, yea I hate lurkers but when you're me.. you get em... I will never hold back how I feel, I just have to be careful what I say in the process because I might get Alex in trouble with things I say ( lol how funny does that sound )  poor guy is 22 years old and he is walking on egg shells at home.. unreal. as if he doesn't have enough to worry about, he has to worry about being told what to do and how to live his life, call me crazy but.. isn't he an adult? shouldn't he be able to make his own choices? hm, guess that is old fashioned?  LOL.  w/eeee... it bothers me to a certian extent because I want nothing but happiness for him, but then again I know one day he will be outta that fucked up situation and on his own (with or without me) and he will be happy regardless.. he is an adult and has every right to live like one.

"event","all's I know is... this morning was probably one of the worst fucking experiances.. they took 6 viles of blood outta me! (bitches) I passed out.. they had to wake me up with this strong ass smelling shit , I don't even know what it was... lol.  I was doing fine up until she took the needle out of my arm, then I just passed out & when I got woken up I felt like I was floating ( a bad high trust me ) it was seriously shitty! but the nurse told me that was the first and last time I was going to have to do that..she said if I ever give any more blood it will only be little amounts.. (thank god!)  I still feel drained and it's 3:30.. the appointment was at 9. blahhhhhh.

My next check up is feb 9th .. as of right now I am planning on being there for that, but shit changes so we will see what is going on by that time.. still thinking about moving back to FL but my only concern is being there before the baby is born so I still have plenty of time to figure out what to do... a lot of things would have to change before I moved back and I don't think it will all happen in a few weeks.. so we will see, either way I will be fine for now, it's not die or need at this point.

anyways, I still feel shitty so I'm going to lay back down.

remember the first day when you smiled at me
you stepped to me and then you said to me
I was the woman you dreamed about
remember the first day when you called my house
remember the first day when you took me out
we had butterflies although we tried to hide
and we both had a beautiful night

The way we held each others hand
the way we talked the way we laughed
it felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one

I know that he loves me cause he told me so
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show
when he stares at me you see he cares for me
you see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause its obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
and he's missing me if he's not kissing me
and when he looks at me his brown eyes tells his soul

Remember the first day, the first day we kissed
remember the first day we had an argument
we apologized and then we compromised
and we haven't argued since
remember the first day we stopped playing games
remember the first day you fell in love with me
it felt so good for you to say those words
cause I felt the same way too

The way we held each others hand
the way we talked the way we laughed
it felt so good to fall in love

"event","each day that passes I get more and more excited about this baby! I am so happy Alex and I were actually TRYING and had sex like every minute of the day, lol... I never really thought it would actually happen though, that's why I know it was destined and is meant to be, because it took 8 months to happen.. that's a decent amount of time... ;) but Alex obviously worked his magic hehe.  The baby was conceived the last week of October... so weird how I didn't take any preggo tests in early November, I normally would take one every week just to see if I was pregnant, I wish I would have to a certian extent, but at the same time living in that house with all the fucking drama wouldn't have been good for me or the baby anyways... so maybe it's best it happened this way, and if I wind up moving back it will be somewhere farrr farrr away from that EVIL place, lol. I don't want my kid anywhere near that BS.

Anywayssss... last night I didn't sleep very well.. someone woke me up! lol, then I couldn't get back to sleep.. blah, I wound up falling asleep around 4 am...I was basically up thinking about a lot... then eventually just passed out.  I have been reading a lot of books that planned parenthood gave me, and a few magazines.. even thought I know I will be a good mother because I pretty much helped Alex raise his 2 boys for a while, I still like to read up on things just to be sure.. I know a few people (won't name names) probably think I won't be able to handle the job.. but little do they know, I am a strong person and I have wanted this for a while now... I have a lot of learning experience.. I have read more info on babies and pregnancy than anyone could imagine.. plus I don't think it takes much.. just a lot of time and love. Everyone says I will make a great mother, including my Ex.. and it means a lot when people think that of you :)

hmmm, ok now that I have vented. ;) I don't think there is anything else newww... We are going to Chucky Cheese for Kylie's Birthday :) hehe, can't wait to see her!! I think I will see my dad and everyone while I am there so it will be great... not sure if I am going to actually stay down there or not.. it all depends on a lot of things... a few reasons why I would want to stay down there is... FL is a lot cheaper and raising a kid down there would be easier... The baby's father lives down there, and no matter what I will never keep this kid from him and I will make sure the baby is in his life, no matter what...the schools are better... I don't know, I have to think about it, but as of right this second I wouldn't have a place to live or anything, so it would have to be planned right... so who know's.. whatever is meant to be will happen, and I stand by that.

Ok, I am tired.. time for a nap. :)

No one is going to make me think of this as a bad choice, I already made one bad choice dec. 4th 04... never again! but maybe that all happened for a reason so I am not going to dwell over the past...

I find out in 9 weeks if it's a boy or a girl... everyone keeps telling me they think it's a boy... I really want a girlllll(bad) but a boy will be just as precious.

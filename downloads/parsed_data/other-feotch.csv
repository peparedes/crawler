I do feel really good today.  I have had a lot of me time and I'm not gonna lie....getting a little tired of it....


So call me.....Let's go get a mocha.  Starbucks is pretty much heaven to me right now!!!!   Except my grandma said that I have way to much daily intake of coffee.  So what?  I'm 5'6""!!

"event","I feel like i need to wite a song, then write a long depressing book and then bury it in the ground -just for laughs.  Thats the way things are around here.  Talk about living a life in the DRAMA business.  Question:  what's so hard about living your own life.  People, being yourself might just be the most cooloi fabulous thihng about you.  Think about it.  We have teddy bears that can just be cute.So really, leave it to the Teddy bears.  Another question:  Who would you rather date? A person who laughed at all your ""jokes"" , continuously tries to prove you wrong in order to make you think they are ""something else"", and turns up their music really loud in the car leaving no room for conversation.  OR  Some one who makes YOU laugh.  Likes to laugh at themself when they look like a complete retard, and agrees with you when they actually agree with you and most of the time have their own opinion, and makes their own music in the car or atleast has a good conversation in the car with you?   I mean.  Its a no brainer to me.  ****It may only take one car ride to have a complete differfent view of someone.  No matter hoe bad that view may be."

"event","I'm feeling changes.  Changes all around me.  Attitudes that never existed untill now.  CJ, why are you pissed at Hannah?  Gaby, am I sensing something unpleasant? Are you ok?  CJ, Gaby, I love you to freakin death!!!  I know I sound like that pathetic little tag-along by bringing up people who apparently want to be distant from you, but I want to know what happened with the old Pete.  If there were no such thing as ""old times"" then there would be no pain in change.  But there is so if we could just turn that down a notch.  I love people.  If I have ever met you, I love you.  I mean that with ALL of my heart."

I wish there was a way to explain it...HANNAH ALWAYS ALTERS HER THINKING FOR YOU.  There's no possible way that you have been wrong in any way, you are always perfect and always right.  Hate me for not understanding, oh, and remember that you understand perfectly whats going on with me.  NOTE THE SARCASM.  Is this it?  ""It was nice knowing you"" -?  ""It was nice while it lasted"" -?  ""I'd rather be cool than be a good friend.  ""I'm glad you exist, Hannah, you're really easy to push around."""

"event","Gilmore Parties are flippin sweet.  You should come if you are obsessed with the Gilmore Girls and sign our Gilmore Guestbook.  Every week on tuesday nights we review the previous episopde and reflect on the current one.
Rules:
       No talking at anytime except during the commercials
       Elders get comfy chairs
       Cell Phones on vibrate.


K.  About Friday, I will have little slips of paper tomorrow to give you if I have specifically talked to you about being in an ensemble.  If you really like to sing and need desperately to get involved, that's cool.  Talk to me.  (I say that too much.  you can talk to me, I just need 2 stop saying that.)


Currently I don't have a calendar for this overwhelming schedule of mine, so if I made plans with you, it would probably be good to remind me.  Monday is off limits. 

Again, call for a part in a movie!!"

Actually have come to find I am an avid blogger much to my irritation because I had always kind of spoken poorly of blogging but I can see now why people do it - it's enjoyable.

Definitely a thing I recommend at least trying once."

"event","Love talking, just having conversation good bad indiff it doesn't matter.

Cool conversation last night about stuff.  Just the regular everyday life that sucks and how to manage.  You basically let life sledgehammer you square in the face and smile and ask for more.  It sounds crazy and it is but it is exactly like what life is like.  I mean think about it for a second.  Okay maybe two seconds.  Take love for example.  If everyone decided after falling in love for the first time and getting their heart broken that screw love it sucks, how many children would not exist right now because of second or third marriages?  It's a sledgehammer to the face man.  You take it and you keep going because you hope the next time you know what to expect and you're not suprised.

Don't let life beat you down, let it help build what you are meant to be - divine."

Finally got logged in so the stress level for the day went down - instantly.  Nothing pisses me off than not being able to log into stuff.  It's like someone saying F*** you - no access!

But anyhow.  I was reading a friend's journal and saw something I have to ask them about.

Damn this technology.  I never know how I'm supposed to reply to this or post to that AGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHh.

Bye...for now."

"event","I found that I have to want to believe in the people who I deal with all day.  I have to want to believe in them as people who want to change.  And as I feel that way I become less afraid to ask them what it is they are really looking for from us.  Sometimes, I even ask them what they want as a resolution.  I had a customer cancel with no refund as an answer.

The way I feel about people, the release of the anger, the choice to feel no anger, the choice to believe in the good of others has allowed the joy that I need in my life to flourish and it has given me the freedom to see the good in others - even if they are angry.

Nothing they can say can hurt me.  They don't know me, they don't see me, I didn't bill them, I didn't charge them, I didn't sign them up.  I am a resource for them and am here to act on their behalf.  If they don't feel that I am their advocate, they will always fight and resist.  If they feel you want the best possible outcome for them, they will trust and believe in you.

Trust me, it works.  I got hung up on today and I felt no anger whatsoever because I treated them with dignity and kindness and respect regardless of how they treated me.  When you treat people that way, kindness empowers you, it bolsters you up until you want to talk to EVERY person because they are a unique opportunity for you to change their life not just change their account."

"event","Why not, day one sounds cool but not too stupid.

Just waking up beginning the day.  Doing one of my favorite things in the ENTIRE world which is driving, well not right now, but a few minutes ago.

I love to drive and listen to music - loud.  Drowns out the world.  It's not even the words that drown it out but the emotion.  Music is like passion that you hear.

But anyway, just a first of no doubt many posts.

Will write more - hey maybe even today."

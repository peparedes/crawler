"event","ok so i havent updated in a while...never really do anyways sooo yea doesnt really matter im just extremely bored right now. psp is out of batteries (been playing since like 630 this morning xD) so i guess taking a break from it is a good thing. theres also nothing to watch on tv and there never really is anything to watch on tv on sundays which is why i hate sundays so much now that i have no car. *sigh* o well w/e...

well yesterday was homecoming and there really isnt much to tell about it. went to work in the morning until 3, went home showered and got ready then went to anna's to meet up with everybody around 340. when i got there diana and rosy were sitting outside waiting for anna ta come home xD so i sat there with them and then anna showed up about 5 minutes later. we all went inside and the grls started doing each others hair while i sat on the couch in the living room playing with my psp waiting for the other guys to arrive. eventually i got bored and went to go talk with the grls, but lets not go there just yet (or at all for that matter) finally the other guys arrived and we ate at anna's house. then we hit the dance which really wasnt all that great cuz they freakin layed a tarp on the ground (which is freakin retarded if you ask me even if it is a new floor) but w/e. danced with diana for about half of the dance but yea thats basically it. left the dance about halfway thru the last song since there really was no point in me staying any longer and my dad wasnt in the mood ta wait for me anyways. yea so thats basically it and maybe ill post again later depending on how bored i am. latez

"event","ok so school has begun and the first week was alright i suppose...

wednesday :
     not much happened today. intro to the classes getting to kno ppl and wutnot. first period is psych not much ta say about that cept we were told we get to go out into the halls and stalk people then report wut we observed. second period was forensic science which is so freakin gay cuz sanford isnt there anymore cuz he supposedly moved ta texas or sumthing and the new teacher is a freakin zimmerman replica >.< o well. third period is physics, teacher is pretty interesting too. he gives us xtra credit for getting high scores on games that he puts up on teacherweb its rather amusing. he also gives us a chance ta not take the final which i basically getting 90% or higher in all grading categories, if it is achieved then we dont hafta take the final, we are allowed unlimited trips to the bathroom and we dont hafta waste time trying to pronounce his name lol. fourth period is gov/econ, got vincench for that not much else happened in that class. fifth period is photo and thats all there is to say about it nothing else happened. 6th period is english, i have langs for that, shes a cool teacher, kinda weird too xD asked me if blue was my natural eye color since i was wearing my contacts xD. after school met up with kristin joanna sara pranav and sum other ppl and went to applebees for lunch. that was the first day of school...

thursday :
     pretty much the same as wednesday. more intro to the classes and getting to kno each other and played sum really retarded name games. not gonna go into detail about that. but that is pretty much it. gave kristin her airsoft gun in the morning and hopefully she wont break it this time xD otherwise shes gonna pay for the entire package next time =P well thats about all that happened on the second day of school.

friday :
     more of the same things as wednesday and thursday. more getting to kno ppl and wutnot. continued watching ""a beautiful mind"" in first period. second period the class found out that the teacher has never taught forensics b4 and had just started taking classes herself over the freakin summer and figured everything would be organized by APRIL (all the more reason to get outta there). third period was alright took notes and yea thats pretty much it. fourth period had a quiz and then started answering questions about the government and civil duty and wutnot. during lunch i went to velazcos office and had my schedule changed to help with making up lost credits from last year (not gonna say how many tho) if you know how many then good for you if not then too bad =]. i am now signed up for new classes and adult school. fifth period was alright did another name game thingie and that was it. 6th period we started talking about quest. that's my school day. after school jack took me home and then my dad took me to fremont adult school to register for the classes but the freakin office was closed when we got there and wouldnt allow an freakin 5 MINUTE exception -.- stupid school board. so thats going to be taken care of on tuesday. and that is pretty much my day.

my new schedule :
     Period 1 - Money Management          Rm61     Ketchum, R (anybody know who this is?)
     Period 2 - Art 1                     Rm63     Pate, S (gonna try and switch to TA for yan)

"event","damn i havent updated this thing in like 2 months lol well within that time frame not much happened. summer school ended and my car got hit that weekend which is so freakin gay cuz now the rest of my summer is pretty much limited to sitting on my ass watching fullmetal alchemist naruto bleach watching tv and playing video games. lucky for me a few of my frends and i got into airsofting and have been doing that ever since which is good cuz i get outta the house and i get exercise too =] well not much happened in the days following the accident (my poor car T.T) so ill just go ahead and give you details on w/e i can think of.

first thing that pops up is last night at niko's birthday party. unfortunately i had ta walk and it took me 2 hours xD. we had an airsoft war and a ping pong tourny (sorta). anyways ping pong tourny was alright shared alotta laughs. joanna fell a few times trying to pick up the ball while it was bouncing around lol. not much else ta say about the ping pong stuff so onto the airsoft war! well lets see, uptej brought his new shotgun and beretta, niko used his new rifle, hobin used his rifle, jake brought his pistol, and later we had another person bring out 4 berettas! 4 OF THEM! well anyways i played about 45 minutes after they started and the first shot that hit me got me on the left cheek thanks ta uptej and his constant headshots while using his shotgun >.< ouch. after that didnt get shot much. but then brian came (i think thats what his name was not sure) with his 4 berettas. we started a game and i got shot by brian right between the eyes. xD i was like HOLY SHIT OW! but yea it was pretty sick. even joanna played she got ta use the shotgun but then she gave it ta uptej. sisi and caite played too but they were only allowed to shoot each other since they were uber noobs and nobody was allowed to shoot them because of that. so halfway through the game sisi moves to the other side looking for caite so she can shoot her. turns out caite jumped the fence into the NEIGHBORS YARD then went around the front of the house to the opposing side to look for sisi. so they eventually got each other out and nobody was moving for like 10 minutes. so me and brian took aaron through the house and into the garage to find the others which were hiding behind a shed in the side yard. jake was duelwielding a beretta and his taurus and uptej was next to him with his shotgun. i opened the screen door and almost got pwnt by uptej i was talking to uptej when aaron comes up behind me and shoots at uptej. then uptej runs into the garage after aaron and they start shooting at each other in the dark. aaron got shot and so hes out. i do beleeve that was the last game of the day. and thats pretty much the entire day. jake gave aaron a third nipple when he shot him with the shotgun lol i got shot a total of 4 times in the head >.< ouch aside from that thats it.

in other news. i got colored contacts ^.^ so now my eyes will be blue or turquoise depending on which ones i feel like wearing for 2 weeks =P they look nice (wish they had red tho...i wanna make myself look a tad bit demonic >=] wahahahha) well anyways thats it for other news. and this is pretty much the end of my post for today. O! i have a myspace now. made it cuz i was bored today and had nothing to do. the url to that is www.myspace.com/l3unnyl30187 add me add me add me add me add me =P well thats pretty much it soo i shall see you all on wednesday (at least those of you who go to IHS anyways)

on friday i went to this barbeque thing for key club or sumthing with crystal and met jason and willis there. pretty cool guys. onli bad thing about the barbeque was that the food got there about an hour and a half later than it was supposed to and we had freakin 5 or 6 people arguing over how to start the damned fire. so in the end me crystal jason and jasons lil bro went out to TK Noodle and ate over there. after we finished eating we planned to go pay josh a visit just fer the hell of it but then jason had to go home fer sum reason or another so i took him and his bro back home and then me and crystal went to joshs house. we got there and turns out josh was as work xD go me lol then i took crystal home and thats friday

"event","To laugh is to risk appearing the fool.
To weep is to risk appearing too sentimental.
To reach out for another is to risk involvement.
To expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self.
To place your ideas and your dreams before a crowd is to risk their loss.
To love is to risk not being loved in return.
To live is to risk dying.
To hope is to risk despair.
To try is to risk failure.

But risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing.
The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing, and IS nothing.
They may avoid suffering and sorrow, but they cannot learn, feel, change, grow, love, or live!
Chained by their servitude, they are a slave.
They have forfeited their freedom.

ONE: Don't miss the boat.

TWO: Remember that we are all in the same boat.

THREE: Plan ahead. It wasn't raining when Noah built the Ark.

FOUR: Stay fit. When you're 60 years old, someone may ask you to do something really big.

FIVE: Don't listen to critics; just get on with the job that needs to be done.

SIX: Build your future on high ground.

SEVEN: For safety's sake, travel in pairs.

EIGHT: Speed isn't always an advantage. The snails were on board with the cheetahs.

NINE: When you're stressed, float awhile.

TEN: Remember, the Ark was built by amateurs; the Titanic by professionals.

ELEVEN: No matter the storm, when you are with God, there's always a rainbow waiting.

"event","This is sonething to think about when negatice people are doing their best to rain on your parade. So remember this story next time someone who knows nothing, and cares less, tries to make ur life miserable.

A woman was at her hairdresser's getting her hair styled for a trip to Rome with her husband. She mentioned the trip to the hairdresser, who responded, ""Rome? Why would anyone want to go there? It's crowded and dirty and full of Italians. You're crazy to go to Rome. So, how are you getting there?""

""We're taking Continental,"" was the reply. ""We got a great rate!""

""Continental!?"" exclaimed the hairdresser. ""That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and theyre always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?""

""We'll be at this exclusice little place over on Rome's Tiber River called Teste.""

""Don't go any further. I know that place. Everybody thinks it's gonna be something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump, the worst hotel in the city! The rooms are small, the servise is surly and they're overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get there?""

""We're going to go see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope.:

""That's rich,"" laughed the hairdresser. ""You and a million other people trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it.""

Amonth later, the woman again came in for a hairdo. The hairdresser asked her about her trip to Rome.

""It was wonderful,"" explained the woman, ""not only were we on time in one of Continental's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a handsome 28-year-old steward who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel was great! They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling job and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra harge!""

""Well,"" muttered the hairdresser, ""That's all well and good, but I kno you din't get to see the Pope.""

""Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the Pope likes to meed some of the visitors and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down and he spoke a few words to me.""

""Oh, really! What'd he say?""

""He said, 'Where'd you get that shitty hairdo?""

so anyways spring break went pretty well. i went ta science camp with henry jerry and todd and met some pretty interesting people there. the kids were pretty good fer the most part..then henry left me all alone on monday...asshole...j/k! yea so i twisted both ankles at least twice during the hikes think i got poison oak on me too dunno but other than that it was pretty fun. one of my kids kept calling me jet li cuz apparently i looked like him from the back with my black shirt and jacket on onli i was taller than jet li sooo yea i ono w/e. DUUDE these kids are onli 5th grade and they kno about shit like crystal meth marijuana and such. they go around complaining about all the drama they have OMFG its SO funny! and then there was a faggot teacher who kept hitting on the female cabin leaders >.< he deserves to die...but anyways all the kids started crying at the end of the week when it was time fer them ta go home i think i almost started crying too xD lol and after that it was pretty mellow. i was packing everything up and moving it ta the car waiting fer henry and then i realized i hadta get my service learning paper signed so i went back to the dining hall and it disappeared n im like ah shit. so im looking for it and crystal randomly comes up ta me grabs my hand and writes her screen name down n im like ookay? dunno wut that was about but yea newaiz got back around 12:30ish went home showered and got bored cuz i had nothing ta do so a couple hours later i called up brian and asked him if he wanted ta go shoot sum pool or sumthing crystal came too. brian kept making fun of how crystal held the stick and also made the most random shot ever! he set the cue ball up fer a shot and he jumped the ball and the ball landed in the pocket. we couldnt stop laffing omg so funni. after pool we went back ta my house and chilled fer a while. we went ta go shoot sum rounds of my pellet guns and then it all went ta hell...i was shooting my V3 and emptied it. i tried ta get the magazine clip out but it wouldnt come out so i thot ok maybe a BB jammed the mag or sumthing i shot it with my hand in front of it ta make sure it wasnt blocked and then the BARREL came out and stabbed me! >.< ouch... that was about it i took crystal back home then took brian home and went n got sum wraps fer my hand. and thats my spring break"

"event","i'm not sure how one person can have such a vivid imagination. daniel wallace is a very imaginative some of the story's he tells are obviously fiction and some of them are just crazy. daniel wallace is a great fiction writer however, i am finding it hard to get in to the book when every few pages another story is being told. i started to watch the move a few days ago and i fell asleep. i guess i will just wait till i finish the book to watch the movie."

"event","when i went to read how i lost my junior miss pageant i was under the impression that the story would truly be about a pageant; stupid me. to every story there is a story, a background, and an underlying message. parents set expectations from the moment they find out they are pregnant, they want us to be the best, they want us to be what they couldn't be. parents get wrapped up in being perfect and forget that they cant change destiny."

"event","the paper that we had to write in class today was a very brod topic, it seemed as if it would be extremely difficult to write that in an hour. last night i sat down to write an out line thinking that my paper would almost completely follow it, however when i started to write what i was brainstorming about i changed my mind. with a topic like 'writer' there was a lot to talk about which made it easy to write a page and a half in less than an hour. i think i did ok;i just hope i did it wright."

"event","i'm not sure what this assignment is exactly for; i mean are we supposed to write about a certain topic each time or what? any ways it is almost 2 am and i cant sleep i just got home and have the day off work tomorrow. i think its weird that we start school for a week and then have a 4 day weekend the next week shouldn't we just wait until after labor day to start. if school started the day after labor day it would be much better, a two day week for the first week is all that is really needed.right?"

"event","It's never going to work,
no matter how much I try
people will only laugh,
on the day I chose to die.

But I'm running out of knives,
to help me ease the pain,
cause they always go missing,
it seems my search in vain.

People only do it to anger me,
not to help me stay,
so I will find an easier method,
to help me fade away.

I find a blood covered blade,
the one I had used before,
hiding in the trash,
just taunting me to do more.

Tonight I wont give them the chance,
to shut the door on my intention,
tonight will be the very last time,
my name they will even mention.

I will not let them help me,
because its not going to do me any good,
especially when they hide my knives,
I feel less and less understood.

With one more little cut,
I wont worry anymore,
cause I wont be thinking about you,
when I'm lying on the floor.

So I calmly hold my breath,
as I press the blade in deep,
never wanting to wake up,
from my self induced sleep.

The blood trickles down my arm,
as a tear falls from my eye,
knowing I won't even be noticed,
i doubt they'll will even cry.

My breath is getting short,
my wrists are on fire,
my vision is getting fuzzy,
I've fallen off the wire.

Everything is getting dark,
and I think this is the end,
as the blade falls from my hand,
my one, my only friend.

Whats really gay is how everyone will say how depressed they are and then there all fine at school then just tell evryone there faking it in there LJ's..... I can understand that some of you are but some people just seem to do it for attention.

I am also starting to get really stressed out again. I am starting to get really pissed out of knowhere for little things, school, family, friends, my gay fucking job. Also my love life fucking sucks rite now. Not like anyone I ever like like's me or is available. Maybe I am Bi-polar or somethin

Driver's Ed is really fucking gay because my teacher is a fucking duchebag an he never shows up. I also am takin this gay D-Mac courses because my math grade sucks. If i don't finish by end of school i'll have summer school.

"event","I just got back from my moms an hadn't been online in a while so i hadn't checked the LJ's but when i do they almost all say the same thing about bein depressed or knowone cares about them. I can understand if u get depreesed but u don't need to say knowone cares about you because to the friends u have, it makes them feel like maybe there not that good of friends anymore. 

But anyway other then that everythin has been ok. Yesterday in math i was tryn to do that 10 deep breath thing then u push on somethin an like the blood rushed to ur head an u fall a sleep for like 20 secs. (idk hard to exsplain) an my face turned blue an i stoped an then my eyes got really boodshot an i had this really bad migrand rest of day an next morning. Then right after i did it i got this rash on my face so i am never doin that again. Some kid at work said his friend did it an blew a blood vessle in his head an the same thin happened so i hope i am cool. lol well anyway i am goin over to josh's so i am gonna go but i am still single so if ur lookin for a stud give me a ring lol j/j........... but seriously call me"

"event","Well I am really bored right now so I thought I would write In my LJ. Theres not really much to do. I can drive in like 25 days an I already have a car so thats cool.

I have also decided that love sucks. You always relize all the messed up things in someone after u start dating them. Its also hard to find time for ur gf/bf and your friends unless ur gf/bf hangs out with ur friends. Its always hard to find someone who likes you too while you like them. Its either u like them an they don't like you or They like you and you don't like them. It makes you do really stupid things too. But of course everyone is lookin for someone its just hard. I need a gf.........

Work is really starting to suck. I seem to always get homework on nites i have work so i never get it done and I have to work like every weekend saturday an sunday so i always usally have a shitty weekend. Then they haven't given me my raise yet an its like 2 weeks overdue. But it was suck cuz if they raise minimam wage then everyone will be at about the same pay wise at work an they people that have been gettin raise for bein there a long time an learnin deparetments are gonna get screwed cuz the new kids an lazy fuckers will have the same pay.

I also need to find some stuff to get for my exsplorer to pimp it out. post suggestions.

why do people post wanna make out at end??? I do so i'll post it to
WANNA MAKE OUT!!!!"

I guess i have just been stressed out lately an its just buildin up so i was in a bad mood. My mom is gonna kill me though when she finds out my grades. Math there is no way i can pass and Bilogy.... well i have mr. rosengren so that pretty much sums it up. I think i'll have a d or f average on report card cuz i didn't do english presentation 100 points and goverment i have like a D. Lunch sucked cuz i am in the hole an i couldn't get anythin an had to have kyle buy me a sandwitch. Haylee shot juice on bretts head an then was bein dumb an shot it all over my shirt. But i guess it was an acident so whatever.... Nate Stockton always gives me rides home an he started givin alyssa w. rides home an he trys to act like a hardass when she is around an they might go out so that will suck. So i hope i can find someone else to start riding with home. My dad an his gf quit there jobs an got new ones an my dad wants me to just leave like right now or right when summer starts an go live in Florida. I guess i could not legally cuz my mom don't got custody by idunno..... well i am gettin bored an i am sure u are to readin this so lata...."

"event","An old enemy. Why is she doing this? I tried making her life hell, the best I could. Sending her mysterious digital messages that were designed to scare her. After all, she left me in the dark years ago, only to do it again a year later. To be honest, I had morbid fantasies about what I would do to her if I had the chance. 

But now, she is coming back. Apologizing. And you know? I can't help but accept the apology. Honestly, I am confused. Should I believe in it? 

She is defending me, I only offended her. 

She came around when the cycle was repeating itself. She started a cyclic kind of pain. She left me, and then over the years, so did many people. And when it came down to a woman who, was a god to me... 

She came back. 

All I think I can do at this point...


...Is thank her. 

Thank her, because all this time, she laid down the bricks for the road to come. Maybe one day, those who have abandoned me recently, will come back again. Everything will have changed. 

Thank You, Alex."

Suckin up all you can, suckin up all you can suck.
Workin up under my patience like a little tick.
Fat little parasite.

Suck me dry.
My blood is bruised and borrowed. You thieving bastards.
You have turned my blood cold and bitter,
beat my compassion black and blue.

Hope this is what you wanted.
Hope this is what you had in mind.
Cuz this is what you're getting.
I hope you're choking. I hope you choke on this.

Taken all I can, taken you like can, you(?) can take.
Taken all you can, Taken all you can f**kin' take
Got nothing left to give to you.

"event","It's alright
There comes a time
Got no patience to search
For peace of mind
Layin' low
Want to take it slow
No more hiding or
Disguising truths I've sold

Everyday it's something
Hits me all so cold
Find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, then I know

It's okay
Had a bad day
Hands are bruised from
Breaking rocks all day
Drained and blue
I bleed for you
You think it's funny, well
You're drowning in it too

Yeah, it's fine
We'll walk down the line
Leave our rain, a cold
Trade for warm sunshine
You my friend
I will defend
And if we change, well I
Love you anyway

"event","I have pulled out of my slumber. 2 years it seems. I woke up and looked at the sky. Seems she has forgotten...

I took a look around. The trees are so bare, and the ground lacks fertile soil. Something is caked onto my legs and arms. Mud, apparently. How long have I been lying here? 

Took a step, and the ground sinks under my foot. I look down and witness the design widen as I lift my foot and the mud I stepped in is displaced. Seems nothing is alive here. Seems that way until a fish bites my toes. No, not a fish. What is it? A tail? Red splotches, and a black frame. Scales. Mud puppies. 

Im am walking in a dried up river-bed. Barefoot, tattered clothing, dirty, broken. 

A sharp pain surges through my wings. I pull it over my shoulder to take a look. What the hell? Its... Its not there! I look at my other wing. Its not there either..."

"event","I fell and landed on my broken wings. Bloodied, severed and broken. 

Didn't say anything that bad. It was only in fear, fear of something I needed not to be afraid of. I just really didn't know. God, why can't you realise that? That text does not do a good job in conveying emotions in their proper manner? Rightfully, I should have been punished, but ONLY for continuing conversation with a daemon. Think of it like this: I asked if I'm going to be punished in a fearful manner, not a sarcastic, mean way. All you could have simply done, was to lecture me in the ways of ignorance against those I wish not to speak to. Instead, you lowered your sweet hand upon my chest and knocked me from the heavens of our friendship. You based your reasoning on past faults, that didn't have any place in the arguement, and when I try to explain myself to you; you wouldn't listen. I just keep reaching out for you, apologizing. Begging forgiveness. And you won't accept. And here, when your Angel comes down with a metaphorical sickness, you apologize, and he accepts just the night before. 

So pardon me, dear sweet Lord of misplaced values, if I begin to get angry. Its just that I am chased away by all of your other angels, when all I tried to do was get back through the gates. As it seems I am no longer in your heaven, I don't feel as if there is any trust left in you for me. So pardon me, dear sweet Lord of disconnected dreams; if I say things that cancels out what ever love you had left in me, as your actions have shown that no love exists. All I needed was just one small sign, and I never got it. Just a sign that a defiant god would not give.

I am Exiled. I am an Angel. My new name is Exile Angel."

"event","Fell from the sky...
He wonders what happened to him and why...
He became the biggest enemy to a god he loved.

Fell through a crack
Landed on his back
Smiling as he looked up
Tears in his eyes, his throat cut up
The love seeping out his voice box and he cries...

""Why?

He saw the light escape from the sun
Saw the blight fill the eyes of the one
Who pushed him off the edge

Fell through a crack
Landed on his back
Smiling as he looked up
Tears in his eyes, his throat cut up
The love seeping out his voice box and he cries...

""Why?""

This is the challenge he's going to have to face
Landed on the ground, a new place.
No one to take his blame.

And the sun no longer shone in the sky
And he wondered why...

""Why?""

""Why?"""

"event","The sky was littered with the tears of a god, whom of which just lost a soul. That souls name was Eric, which means ""Warrior of God."" 

The god whom we speak of was not the god you think of. This god was a lady of a bright complexion and dark hair. The lady of stars he once called her, though not to her face. Of course that was ages ago...

He was an innocent li'l lad. He loved his god, his family, and the music he played. He even put Gabriel to shame. That god was his biggest fan, and in turn, he was a part of a tripod that held his god up...

Until..."

"event","i'm not being a brat.
i love the different colors on the walls in my house. ah yes, a purple living room, a yellow kitchen, a blue mom's room, a white studio, a violet sister's room, a green bathroom bathroom, and best of all, my purple room. mine is the best. it's goofy and with it's walls, makes a bad day not so crappy after all.

SUPAFUN!!!"

"event","i have not written in a long time, if anyone actually cares... but i guess all this journal writing crap is just too marcia brady for me. I cannot handle it! oh well, maybe someone out there is interested in my life right now, but really it is just the same 'ol same 'ol.agghhh! joel is in turkey, crista wrote an essay a week early, nate still has my binder (shit! i have an econ. vocab test in the morning!), kristine has semi-city today, and i am @ west la, not in class... duh. i am really hungry, do you know why? today, i bought this really cool nail polish at sav-on called ""dreamy poppy."" i love nail polish. not in the superficial perfectionist way, but i have a ridiculous obsession with hands, and nail color is totally an artistic outlet for me. i love all the different colors, the names, photos of hands, doing my nails, and of course doing other people's. i love it because it is so flashy, yet only a subtle contribution to external appearance. ya, i am a freak. they make yellow colored nail polish, and it reminds me of bananas. i am bored. at least i have my mini disk player with me. did you guys ever think about how stupid prom is? all of the ""traditions"" associated with the disgusting event are equally as dumb. ya ya, i know i am a bitter, but you have to admit that corsages are sooooooooo ugly and over-priced. crista, i have a present for you. remind me to bring it."

"event","i went to the promenade on saturday for the first time this year (i think). i remembered why i avoided it. there are so many kids that hang out there, and it annoys me to see they are middle school abercrombie/kate spade freaks. ewww. but it's all good, because we ate at one of my favorite restaurants, Gaucho Grill. only when i am around argentinian food do i feel stupid for not eating meat. oh well. it annoys me when people wear sunglasses indoors. idiots. so i was thinking about what i want to do this summer, and this is what i came up with so far: 
1. work. definitely, i have to.
2. skydiving, hell ya. problem? who would do it with me?
3. backpacking down south america. i really want to see chile, and i also want to see pablo neruda's house which is now a museum.
4. read aphrodite: goddess of the senses.
5. moulin rouge at midnight on fridays.
6. buy some dvds.
7. lastly, i really just want to be with the people i care about. ah yes... summer nights.
hopefully i'll do these things, but we shall see. hey, seven is the lucky number right? well, there's not much else on my mind. i am lying, there's lots. this song reminds me of adam sandler."

"event","today was such a great day. i have not had one of those in a long time. actually, since wednesday, but i wont go there, because today is friday. so yeah... today was great. let me start out with the fascinating feeling i had last night after i had finished reading ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"" by James Joyce. When i first read about joyce after reading a short story last year, i decided he was an egomaniac. but now i know why. his character stephen in portrait is really his own biographical character, and i loved stephen! i was so inspired after reading that book, that i decided that instead of sinking into a depressed state about whatever is going on in my life (which is hecho torta up till now), i can wake up to something new every day. i can wake up and... daily decision: am i enjoying myself?  if so, then go me! if not, then what can i do to make it so? who cares if anyone disapproves. i realized that i really should not conform to what i'm supposed to. it really is the only way i can be happy. i had a good time today, and i spent it with myself. what did i do that was so different? i really took joy in those little things that just make you smile. for instance, i arranged a martini glass on my shelf in front of a stuffed monkey who is now named chico, and i filled the glass with four plastic mini-bananas. next, i decided that i loved the way candy adds color to rooms, so i poured a bag of skittles in a glass moon shaped bottle, and set it next to chico (this moon also serves as a book end). from this day forward, i vow to always have decorative candy in as many rooms of my house as possible. okay, next. mini candles everywhere. the little ones inside the tins that you buy in millions at ikea. then, i painted my computer's mouse with sparkly nail polish. meanwhile, i lit the incense my grandmother always brings back from her trips to india. that's always fun. who knows why this totally made my week. but i can enjoy being alone as long as i occupy myself with petty activities. why not?"

"event","Yay! my first real journal entry. I'm so excited because my friend crista had been trying to get me into the online journal community. I also felt like a crummy friend whenever joel asked ""have you read my live journal?"" when i said no he always made that ""ohwww."" maybe this was just a plan on both their parts to get me online more often.... just maybe. 
i am really upset with myself today b/c school starts in a day and some hours. since my craze for counting down days until graduation, i would normally be happy that time passes as quickly as it does, however; my work for my classes have been collecting dust this week. oh well. i did do a painful assignment on wednesday though. i counted how many letter (all A-Z) there were of each in half a box of post ""alpha-bits."" the next day, crista helped me with the other half, thank god! or thank crista... thank you crista. this is a horrible statistics project, and for the sake of my happiness (and your relief), i will not explain. after an uneventful week, friday was the highlight of my spring break, and possibly of the month. i went on the greyhound for the first time ever. as i expected, there was a large number of loonies at the station. this included the guy in line who was having a conversation with himself, and a little girl with a shirt that had ""born on drugs"" plastered on the front. we boarded the bus an hour and a half late, and were on our way to see tori amos perform in santa barbara. we arrived and walked the three blocks to the theater. to my surprise, there were many people there already (the concert didn't start for hours, i mean HOurs. turns out there was supposed to be a meet & greet. after waiting for hours with my little camera, all ready to take a picture with tori, a guy tells everyone to go away b/c there would be no meet & greet. grrrr. that's okay though, because i played cards with crista, bought lunch for the guy outside mcdonald's, and joel bought a picture of tori for $1. later, we went to a nearby thrift store, where this super old man (like 80) started talking to me about sexy novels. he was a nice old man, and i picked out a poncho for him. he told me i had a good eye, and asked if i would pick out a nice shirt for taking his girlfriend dancing. when i went away, he asked joel if i was old enough to date. weird.
we ate at a sushi place. it was shitty, cuz the waiter took 30 minutes for everything he did, including bringing us the check. we got our revenge by sticking ice cube in the wasabi container and a nasty mix of that with ginger and soy sauce in the miso soup bowl. it was so gross (but fun in the process). we went back to mcdonald's for chicken nuggets and dessert. when it came time for the concert, we went, and joel sold his leftover ticket to conrad and neda, whoever they are. 
the concert was awesome! the ride home was another story. i was half away, and thinking of all these negative thoughts. which i would not even begin to try to explain, b/c in more than one sense, i can't.
now that the excitement has worn down to nothing, i don't have anything remotely interesting to say, except my conflicting ideas about whether or not i should go to church this sunday."

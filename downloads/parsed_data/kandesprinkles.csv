"event","<< somewhere b e t w e e n the procrastination.... and the homework..... 
 and the incessant forwards.....and jobs....and the friendships..... and the 
calls to each other complaining about crushes!!...... Somewhere b e t w e e n 
the phone calls to old friends..... And the ""I miss you's"", the ""I love you's""
....... And the ""What are we doing tonight's?""..... And somewhere b e t w ee n
 all of the changing,growing... Somewhere b e t w e e n the classes........ 
And the skipping classes...... And the studying for tests.......And the 
pretending to study for tests....... And the downright NOT studying for tests
... I forgot.......... I forgot what life is all about. I forgot what it 
meant to cry....... I forgot that pretending to be happy doesn't make you 
happy........... And that pretending to be smart doesn't make you smart 
............ I forgot that you can't just forget the past in fear of the 
future.......... I forgot that you can't control falling in love........... 
And that you can't make yourself fall in love........... I learned that I can 
love......... I learned that it's okay to mess up......... And it's okay to 
ask for help......... And it's okay to feel like crap......... I learned it's 
okay to complain and whine to all your friends for a whole day........ I 
learned that sometimes the things you want most you just can't have. I 
learned that the greatest things in life are not the parties or the DRiNKiNG 
or the hook-ups... It's the friendships, which means taking chances........ I 
learned that sometimes the things we want to forget are the things which we 
most need to talk about.......... I learned that letters from friends are the 
most important things.And that sending cards to your friends makes you feel 
better. But, basically, I just learned that my friends........ Both o l d and 
new......... Are the most important people to me in the world. AND.......
without them, I wouldn't be who I am today..... So this is a thank you to all 
of my friends. . For always being there. And even if we're not on good terms 
or we have lost touch... I still care for you. >>"

But the only thing that matters is my mohawk.  I actually got the thing up.  I have to cut it in half.  I can't fit in cars.  It'll still be quite pretty though.  You can see it at the site below.

"event","Broken Devotion

I speak when spoken to,
but you never seem to hear.
My screams of suffering
always lost on deaf ears;
awakening my worst fears.
Come save me from my realistic nightmares.
I am trapped in the twilight,
the twilight of my own destructive reality.
Drifting through this hollow existence,
you are so much above me,
like the stars that inhibit my broken dreamed sky.
You're all I worship,
my only devotion,
but my sacrifices mean nothing to you.
Turn your back and betray me once again.
Just as it was played in centuries past,
this love song sings on a dead record.
Dust lies there to collect,
upon my parted soul.
Your house is not my home."

The party is for Emmiephish because she left for London and Tuscany and eventually made her way back to this hell-hole in the world.  We are trying corsets and bustiers on.  My insides are squished and moved.  Emmmie has these posh sunglasses (super cute).  The pizza is here.  We are talking about sex and anything related.  Lovely heh?  We complain about our boobs and the adventures they have been through.  Every one of us is the sexy dominatrix that we dream to be.  Picture that.  Time to leave and join back with the last of humanity."

"event","I am under strict instruction to tell about my adventures in the Infamouse Cake Business from my dearly beloved best friend Mel Mel.  First, I work for a cake company in the local Daytona Beach/Holly Hill area named DePree (the owner's significant other's last name).  We make 8 assorted flavors of rum cakes; Amarreto, Frangelico, Grand Marnier, Limoncello, Traditional Italian Rum, Coconut Rum, Chocolate Rum, and Chocolate Chambord.  We use real alcohol.  Usually we sell them wholesale to Hotels, Country Clubs, and Up-scale restuarants.  Now my boss wants to sell to the public through Sams Club.  The cake is $19.88.  We now have to go on road shows where every week we go to a different Sams Club and attempt to promote our cakes by giving out free samples.  People are demons. Either they are diabetic and say they won't buy because of that (all the while they are stuffing their fat faces full of cakes and wasting my time) or they gush about how good the cake is, but in the end don't want to pay the price (SHUT UP and GO AWAY!!!).  Oh wait, I forgot the good part!  You have the old people with nasty sores all over their skin come by and put their fingers through the cake [that you use for samples] trying to get a piece because they can't wait 3 seconds for me to get gloves on.  GROSS.  And to add to that my mom thought that I would actually like this hell-hole of a job.  I like people (actually to put it in better terms, I enjoy being around people) but I don't like interacting with most.  This is so because I think half of the human race is not fit to be alive, is stupid, or that I don't understand where they come up with the reason to see where they are right or nothing is wrong with them.  I feel better already.  You probably asking why I keep this torture of a job.  The paycheck.  It definently beats working at a fast-food joint.  Also, the work is not labor and I get paid way more.  Plus I only have to work as much as I want (very flexible).  Lovely heh?"

"event","Inside What You See

Starting the deconstruction,
demolition of the broken-hearted;
Beloved, we were always meant to be parted.
Voting for better or for worst:
the World is cursed,
like vampyres and their immortal eternity.
Silly, I look on the bright side of things.
You'll never know what good darkness brings.
All I hear is silence,
violence is to what we are blind.
The Earth turns its head:
betraying our own kind.
Dead the grave is at stroke of midnight;
some day we'll all see the light.
Just take a look inside,
(don't run and hide)
and tell people what you see.
Promise not to lie to me."

When all are sleeping,
breathing deeply and dreaming;
I lie awake,
these dreams do I make.

The night sky,
the moon above up high;
it's light setting,
with the moon rising.

It is just me,
forever and eternity;
with loneliness,
and the comfort of the darkness."

"event","Open the Doors

All I remember is your beautiful face.

The soft surrender of your sweet voice drifting through space.

As memories come racing back,

My heart takes its last beat; its traumatized.

Nothing ever seems to be on track.

Your waiting for me, but I just stand there mesmerized.

I am lost traveling in every direction with no destination.

If only I could have some of your passionate kisses.

If only to feel the warmth of your blessed body next to me.

All I ask for is these forbidden blisses.

Open the doors to this lonely soul; only you have the key."

"event","What Somebody Else Wanted

My thoughts are like garbage.
Looking into a shattered image,
it's what somebody else wanted me to be;
but that's not what I'm supposed to see,
Let me pick up a piece,
maybe it'll help me find some peace.

The turmoil that's raging inside,
there's nowhere to run and hide; 
Except to look at myself,
and take a book down from this forgotten shelf.

As I turned the pages,
reading every single part,
I taught my mind and my heart,
to break free of their cages.

Then there was sweet silence,
finally stopping all the violence;
becuase I came to realize ,
that pretending to be someone else,
only lead to a dark demise.

I think I'll be myself."

But tomorrow,
with last echo of your sorrow;
a song that sounds 
so lonely and hollow,

When you finished crying,
(a pool of sadness)
you sat there wondering,
if you could ever find happiness.

As your heart turned to stone
and you cam to see,
it was never meant to be;
You would always be alone."

Come my children of the Night
follow Midnight's call,
Let us frollick in the Moonlight,
Come one Come all.

Chase the Dark,
Embrace its deep shadows,
trample through meadows,
Don't leave till you hear the Lark.

The stars above are a treat,
and the song of the midsummer's breeze,
to your ears so sweet,
and so is the whisper of the trees.

Come my children of the Night
follow Midnight's call,
let us frollick in the Moonlight,
Come one Come all."

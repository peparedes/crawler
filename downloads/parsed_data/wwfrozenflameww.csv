which leads to me to part that amazes me.. these people.. that are so hurt and feel so badly now.. make me feel this way all the time.. all the time.. what happened to them, they do to me constantly.. sometimes weekly.. it's not so much that it hurts anymore, not like it used to anyways.. when it first started happening to me, it felt almost unbearable because it happened almost daily.. but now.. after years.. i've actually become numb (for the most part) to the feeling.. it still hurts occasionally, especially when it pertains to something i enjoy or would have.. but they act like it's the worst feeling in the world..

now.. dont get me wrong.. at times, it really is the worst feeling in the world.. but they're the ones who usually give it to people.. they're the ones that usually make other people feel that way.. and now.. hehe.. i know it's wrong.. i know that i shouldnt laugh, but i cant really help myself.. it's amazing.. it really is.. to see them, and hear them complain so much.. they dont truly know what it's like to feel that way.. no one does until the experiance over and over and over again, especially from their closest friends...

You don't remember me,
But I remember you.
I lie awake and try so hard,
Not to think of you.
But who (who) can (can) decide,
What they dream ?
And dream I do...
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
Have you forgotten all I know,
And all we had ?
You saw me mourning my love for you,
And touched my hand.
I knew you loved me then.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
I look in the mirror and see your face.
If I look deep enough.
So many things inside that are just like you are<br>taking over.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me,
(You're taking over me),
You're taking over me,
(Taking over me), Taking over me.

You're often depicted as the cold, distant season.
But you're incredibly intelligent, mature and 
Independant. You have an air of power around
you - and that can sometimes scare people off. 
You're complex, and get hurt easily - so you 
rarely let people in if you can help it. You 
can be somewhat of a loner, but just as easily 
you could be the leader of many. You Tend to be 
negative, and hard to relate to, but you give 
off a relaxed image despite being insecure - 
and secretly many people long to be like you, 
not knowing how deep the Winter season really 
is. 

Well done... You're the most inspirational of seasons :)

[Jake Genzuk]

The agony I feel inside
Is nothing like before;
I can feel my heart inside
Waging it's own war.

The canon shoots,
The fort takes fire,
And the walls of
Fort Love begin to fall.

The mind is hurt,
The heart perseveres,
The eyes do their best
To hold back the tears.

The troops fight back,
The canons go down,
Love charges on as 
The trumpets call.

Her love shines lightly,
Like sunlight in the dead of night,
Rejuvenating that which was done,
My heart regains the will to fight."

lindsay is <em>not</em> the one for me.. it's that simple.. jade kinda helped me realize that.. but i dun think she knows it.. and the fact that she kinda totally ignored me online the other day.. well.. yeah.. she's not the one.. which leads me to..

	<strong>the decision</strong>
i've moved on from lindsay.. 3 years without saying a word should've been enough.. but now.. it was jojo telling me that i wasnt the only one who could see me with this other gurl.. and the more and more i talk to this gurl.. she makes me think we'd make a better match more and more.. and i know connie is saying to herself right now 'dont get your hopes up jake..' well... no worries con bon.. i've begun to stop getting my hopes up.. i'm just.. i dunno.. well.. even if i am getting my hopes up.. they're not <em>that</em> high yet.. so dont worry.. okay? 

	<strong>the decision</strong>
well.. i'm drum major again.. cool to me.. i dunno about anyone else... haha.. so.. yeah.. congrats to ulysses, cary, and jen..

well.. that just about sums up my entire week.. kinda boring if you ask me.. but.. yeah.. haha.. anyways.. off to do more stuff.. dunno what exactly.. but stuff.. haha... laterdayz..."

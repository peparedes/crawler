Me and a few of my friends got into an interesting discussion last night... What exactly is hooking up? Girls seem to think it can be used for just about anything from making out to having sex, but guys are saying they would only say ""I hooked up"" if they had sex. If you don't say hooked up what terminology do you use? Fooled around to me sounds more crude than ""hooked up"" but then again its just more specific. I would like some feedback.. girls and guys please... what does ""hooking up"" mean?

This weekend was amazing for the record. I went to Brad and Schotte's Friday and Saturday night. Friday night after the party I went to Ross street to watch Curb Your Enthusiasm with the guys, and Greenaway fell asleep sitting up.. it was really funny and I wish I had thought to take a picture. The cops busted the party up Saturday night (I think they came Friday night also but I might not have been there anymore...) The cop thing is a REALLY long story, and I don't really want to type it all out. Most people know what happened anyway (Its just a story about cops being dicks.. if you want to hear it call me and I will fill you in.)

Now I am off to study at the library, and then run at the rec center... thats right, I am super productive!"

"event","So this week was hard. I had 2 tests and a 4 page paper due. On top of all of that I was fighting with all my room mates, and that was horrible. We were in an all out war, and nothing was really being accomplished but everyone was getting more and more pissed. We got into a screaming match and worked it all out.. so that is a lot of stress off my shoulders. I struggled all week on my work and then my TA's shit all over my hard work today. My TA in accounting said that very few people did well on the test tuesday, and my Russian Culture TA said that people didnt understand the paper assignment... 20 min before its due. YES! So I get out of my Russian lab, and see one of my good friends, who totally blows me off. I don't know why... maybe because of who he was with... but I was upset. Than I was going to cook dinner for the guys,... but most of them were busy so it was Me and Chris (Aaron and Adam came over too, so it wasn't wasted). But thats enough bitching!!!

So it is Friday night, and I am bound and determined to have a good weekend. Hopefully Katie and I will go to the mall tomorrow, and there is supposed to be a big party off Pimlico (Brad and Schotte's) so tomorrow should be good. So far tonight I am watching Boston and Chris play Mario Tennis... I hope it picks up soon.

Well if you have anything to do this weekend give me a call, I'm glad I ranted and got it out of my system."

"event","So this weekend was AMAZING!!! Friday I went to dinner with two of my aunts, and then we went to the balloon glow in Forest Park. It was so magical... I felt like a 3 year old because I was mesmerized. 

Saturday I went to my Dad's house... he changed my oil, filled my car with gas, took me to lunch, and got me a mini fridge. I had to study Nutrition, which ended in a phenomenal nap (because nutrition is boring). Later that night I went to Nick Hall's house and hung out with the guys. It was fun, but not huge.. but its not about how big a party is, its how much fun the people you are surrounded with are.

Today I did the family thing.. which I enjoy. I have a really interesting family. My little cousin (who is 5) followed me around for most of the day. I think its cute, and I like kids so I felt special. I heard some stories about my Grandma that were interesting (she used to be quite the drinker) and just hung out all day. My brother got me the new Dane Cook CD, and that makes me very happy. I have heard amazing things... and I must admit so far it is good. Well, I made the drive back to columbia.. windows down... ROCKING out to random songs the whole way. 

Now I have to say... I have some great friends. When I got back, I had the mini fridge (which is actually quite large...) which I couldn't get up 3 flights of stairs if my life depended on it... so Boston and Chris came over to bring it to my room. I have some great friends... and that made my already amazing day that much better. 

Now I am very sleepy, so I am going to bed. Thank you very much everyone who wished me a happy birthday... I have some great friends!!"

"event","I had a HUGE math test today, and now it is finally over so I can stop stressing. I literally had nightmares for days about it. I feel as if I did well... so we will see. I am so excited about life right now, no math class tomorrow, I get to see my family, eat amazing food, and study.. but other than that last one it should be great.

I think Boston and Jim might call me to hang out sat night, so I might go out there (crossing the river... OH NO!) but I'm not really sure yet. Hopefully I can find some gas tomorrow... Break Time was all out and the lady was a bitch... that made it worse. Well, because I am boring and tired I am going to bed... I will write all about my birthday on sunday.. which will be interesting to me and nobody else will probably care.. but oh well. You'll read what I tell you to, and you will like it!!!"

"event","Thursday I have a math test, so all week is devoted to study time. I am exhausted at the moment from to much work and not nearly enough sleep. I wanted to write a quick update anyway. This weekend I am going home for my birthday (which is sunday for anyone who wants to know).

I have been stressing lately over my classes and boys, and everything is really falling into place. I seem to be understanding my math well, (or at least I am working through the problems without having to step back and cool off to figure out the answers...) And my other classes aren't as boring as they have been. (That is one thing that sucks about being a business major... boring class after boring class that all pour into each other.) I delt with the relationship issues, and I feel much better. I think I will continue to go running a few times a week, I HATE running but I feel amazing after I do, so I guess it works out in the end."

"event","So I am on campus, I have a 2 hour break, my cell phone is almost dead (can't call anyone) and I don't have my ipod. Livejournal seemed like a good thing to occupy some time. 

I am SO excited that it is Friday. Today I have 3 classes, and 3 hours of breaks in between. Of course my last class isn't canceled, but it is my Russian class, and I like it most of the time. The professor is a little monotone (I mean, I laugh because I always think of steven hawking when I am in his class...) but today is my lab, and the TA is really cool. 

Next weekend I am going home for my birthday. As of Sunday the 18th I am no longer a teenager. I am excited to go home... going home every now and then is nice. I'm not going to lie, I am excited about my birthday. Who doesn't like their own birthday?

September 30th I might be going to KC to see Jason Mraz, but I don't know if it will happen or not. The tickets are 5 bucks through anyone who goes there, but you can only get one ticket per student ID. There are like... somewhere between 6 and 8 of us who want to go. So the 2 or 3 people who know people there would have to find 8 of their friends willing to go buy tickets for some random people, and who also didn't plan on going to see Jason Mraz for 5 bucks in the first place. I don't know anyone at UMKC, so I guess I am SOL. Also... everyone is staying with some girls I don't know, and you never really know if it is cool to bring another girl. Sometimes girls don't like other girls tagging along. I would like to go... so hopefully I will get a ticket... but its not the end of the world if I don't make it.

In October I am going camping with a bunch of the guys for Jim's birthday. I've never been camping before so I am really excited. I am also nervous because I know I'm not easy to get along with for long periods of time... I mean... I am just going to admit when I get hungry I get cranky, I hate bugs, and I am VERY sensitive to temperature. I have this all under control... bring a box of granola bars, it will be October so there shouldn't be many bugs, and lastly it wont be hot, so all I have to worry about is wearing layers. Plus how amazing are all the trees in Missouri going to look in mid October? (Hopefully really amazing.)

Sidebar- there is a guy across from me in the Hitt Street computer lab listening to... I shit you not... a WALKMAN! Like, old school 80's large sony headphones and all. This makes me smile. At one point I had a bright yellow walkman that was huge... and I loved it. (Ok, I stole it from my Dad, but it was sweet.) anyway... thats all...

I know this was like the most pointless random Live Journal ever... but I am bored. I still have an hour and 10 min before I have to get to class. AHHH"

"event","I am going to rant, and this might not even be coherent... I am just a little worked up and I need to vent. Read it if you want, and leave a message if you have an opinion.

Ok... Lately I have been a little high strung! I am kind of upset about my classes, and I am just worried. I've got some hard classes this semester and I think everything is going ok, but I am worried that its NOT. So I am trying to relax, and study, and calm my mind. Another part is relationship problems. Most of you know what I am talking about.. so I'm not really going into any background... here goes..

I know people always talk about how they can change.. but can they? I mean, droping bad habits is one thing, but where is the line between a bad habit and the simple fact that just is your personality? I don't know if people can change who they are. We might like to think that we can, but haven't you found that you always fall into your habits? I crack my knuckles, and I don't even realize I do it 90 percent of the time, it just happens. So maybe its always like that, maybe people yell, and they don't realize how bad it is, or they say hurtful things and don't even think twice about how that effect other people. 

So what is a bad habit that someone can stop if they really put their mind to it, and what is just human nature that will always creep back into their daily lives? And at what point is it just to late to salvage anything? Maybe you really CAN change, but maybe whoever you want to change for has already taken way to much shit and is just fed up, and can't forget everything.

I am always on guard, waiting for a relapse, waiting for that call or text message, where I am in the same situation, and I feel trapped... good intentions or not. I don't know... when is it just to much?


Please respond... if you have any opinion whatsoever."

"event","So Sunday I went to the guys apartment in the afternoon and we hung out until I had to go to church. A pizza arrived just as I was getting back, which was amazing because I was hungry. Jim had already been pregaming all afternoon, so I knew the night was off to a good start. A few of their friends came in from St. Louis, and of course the 4 that live there, Adam, Aaron, me, Charlotte, and Jessie all kicked off the party. Over all it was amazing, but there were a few parts that were weird... There was unpleasant words had between one of the guys and an old friend of theirs... which resulted in the girls leaving... then later some guys showed up that were just not being cool for some reason. Jim apparently was ""burning bridges"". Later in the night Chris busted out Jim's pimp shirt... and then we all got our hands on anything we could (Jim also had a bunch of dew rags, and ryan has a pimp shirt also) It was SO funny! If anyone wants to see go to my webshots.. there are a million pictures of the whole night. Anyway, I went to cook breakfast in the morning but nobody was up until like 12, so I slept on some little cot thing on the floor until everyone woke up. 

Charlotte came over the next day and Boston Jim and I went to help her with an interview thing, she had to ask somebody questions (being videotaped) and it can't be a student. We found this really funny guy... his occupation: Rock and Roller. (keep in mind this guy had all white hair, I mean he could have been 60 easily) In the middle his friend came up and started talking to us, and was talking about how it wasn't to late for Boston to find God (the lecture was brought about when the guy looked at his shirt which had a pot leaf on it..) This guy even said where there's one it goes right down the line and tried to accuse me of smoking... I was like hey man.. I am clean! The guys were very amusing, and it was just one of those things that makes you think.. how many crazy people are there who's main income is some band when they are in their 50's, and who thats all they do is walk around downtown columbia in their dew rags talking about how Jesus saves lives... They should meet brother Jed. ha ha...

Anyway I had a great weekend... and now I am back to school work (working ahead in math because I am DEDICATED!!)"

"event","Friday Travis came to see me, and when I got to his car I saw a huge bouquet of Orange Lillies (I love lillies). We hung out for a while and went to Ross street to hang out with the guys, and to my surprise they all got along really well. I didn't know how they would really take each other... but everyone got along great and we all had a blast (well, I did, and I think everyone else did too) Drunk Jim is like one of the funniest things ever. He says some great stuff... but then again drunk kids always amuse me.

Yesterday we went to LSD (lee street deli) with Jim, Boston, Ryan, and Jim's parents. Jim's parents were pretty cool... anyway... Later that day I continued my bad luck streak... I haven't written about it yet so I will sum it up really quick

1) It rained really hard last friday, and on my way to campus I got splashed by 3 cars on the side of the road, and by the time i got to Cornell my pants were soaked up to the back pockets (literally). So I go to the bathroom and ring out my pants, but 2 girls walked in and saw half my ass while I was doing it. (It could have been worse... lets just say it wasn't a thong, but it wasn't granny panties.) By the end of the day I laughed it off.. it was pretty funny

2) A few days later my math teacher singled me out and embarrassed me in front of our whole class... long story short I started to cry, and had to do a make up assignment. As I am still all red in the face and sniffling I realize I don't have my book because I didn't think I would need it for the day, so then like 10 people around me who feel bad for me because I am making an ass out of myself crying start looking for books for me to borrow... All ended well... nobody laughed at me to my face, and I didn't get a zero...

3) Later that day I cut my finger with a butter knife

4) I was baking cookies and SOMEONE (cough-Boston-cough) turned off the oven, and the cookies looked like huge pancakes... they covered the baking sheet from side to side. The guys all laughed at me for them turning out bad... but then we figured out what the problem had been and the next batch was a little better. (Basically, I made unsuccessful cookies, and that is one thing I KNOW I am good at is baking...)

5) I bit my lip eating a grape and I keep biting the same spot because its huge... and it hurts

6) On top of all those things I was fighting with travis A LOT

7) Now for the kicker... the one that happened yesterday... I go to cook some dinner (Travis is taking out the trash for me) and as soon as the burner heats up on my stove it lights on fire. I mean a HUGE monster flames a foot and a half tall. I freak out, and it wont go out, I put a lid on it, and it was smoking like a bitch, then the smoke detector starts going nuts, I am all alone looking for baking soda shaking thinking my apartment is going to burn down, I cant ever find any baking soda, and eventually the fire smothers itself out... but the smoke detector is still going nuts. I open all the windows and wave smoke away from the detector and get it all under control, but everyone in my building was coming out trying to figure out whos alarm was going off and... it sucked. bad.

Anyway, later last night we went to Don Newman's and I saw some old friends. I got a random text message from someone that pissed me off from that same group of old friends... I don't know if it was related because the kid who sent it wasn't in town. Travis left this morning, and today is Boston's birthday so I will be going to hang out with the boys shortly, and I will probably be there all day... I hope I have some crazy stories to write and some crazy pictures to put up after tonight..."

The only thing left to do for tomorrow is figure out what I am going to do in my two hour break. I SHOULD go work out, but I have been losing weight just from walking so much, so maybe it wouldn't kill me to do something else. 

This weekend is going to be huge! Tonight going for a bit to hang out in bearfield with the boys, then tomorrow party in east campus, saturday party at Don Newman's (some friends I haven't seen in a long time will be there), Sunday is Boston's birthday so they are having people over, and Monday no school, so I guess I will be doing some homework and I told the guys I would cook for them. Travis is supposed to come visit this weekend, but its still kind of up in the air. I don't think I will really know if he is coming until he shows up (or doesn't show for that matter).

For now all I am going to worry about is what time I am heading to bearfield... and what I am going to wear. Call me if you are looking for something to do this weekend"

There is nothing better than having random deep conversations, and I had a lot on Friday. Not about anything super important at all (we talked about wingmen and what they do, and about the counter to the wingman... the cock block and a few other things in that general area). Saturday after about 5 hours of sleep I went to the mall for my first shopping experience of the semester, and then spent the entire day at the Ross Street apartments. Charlotte and I walked to bread co, watched movies, took a nap, and did nothing productive all day. It was great!

This weekend is supposed to be the same... thursday at Brad's, Friday party at Franks, Saturday who knows. Travis is coming to visit this weekend... so I don't really know what I will be doing. I know he doesn't want to go to anything big, but I want him to meet all my friends so we'll see. 

Today I did laundry for the first time... its not the laundry that I hate... its the ironing. I'll be putting that off for a while. I am eating up living in an apartment. I love cooking for myself instead of eating nasty dorm food. Even better than anything else is just being in college. Going to classes and being on your own and all that is fun, and it makes me feel as if I am worth something as opposed to being a hostess where I feel like I'm doing nothing challenging. Speaking of challenging, I need to write a small paper."

I got a parking pass from some of my friends who live in east campus, so I park off of Ross Street instead of AV 14. (I would have killed myself if I had to drive to campus, then take a bus or walk 3 miles to ACTUAL campus.) My math teacher is Russian, which is good because I can understand her well but she's bad because she goes really fast and doesn't explain any concepts in depth. I am in the process of looking for a tutor... and just saying those words makes me sick. I hate being totally lost in class and it makes me feel like I'm a failure. I'm sure I'll do fine if I REALLY REALLY try and admit when I need help. Oh well, onto better things...

I made dinner for Sean, Boston, Ryan, and Jim tonight. We had pasta with garlic bread, and tomorrow is taco/burrito night. Its a really sweet deal, all I do is cook (and do the dishes) and I get to eat for free.

Perhaps the most capable of escape also. One of them was on the top of these fake rocks.. I swear he could have been out of there in one leap. Anyway.. I love the zoo! I would go all the time if I could.

We opted for gym shorts because those were less obvious than wearing a sheet. I had more fun in the car driving to and in between parties than I had at the actual houses. There were some funny quotes... but I'm sure you had to be there. Plus I had a good time in the afternoon.

Right now I can't really sleep, and I don't have class until 10 so I am updating and listening to some Gavin. I have been studying geology a lot, (which I say is studying rocks) and I think I am going to go study some rocks... because the stories from last night aren't really appropriate to share.

After all that went down Karen and I went to Hitt and got frozen cokes and silly string. We got Katie hard core, and it was hilarious. At first everyone tries to fight it, but you have to realize there isn't much you can do when people have you cornered with silly string so she gave up. 

I stayed up late and finished some homework. I had a paper to finish, and an essay type deal for speech. Now I am really done with all work except for finals. I am going to start studying tonight, and then rape all 3 of my finals that I have to take. I am really happy that I don't have a lot of work because its Charlotte's birthday this week!!

"event","This weekend was so much fun! After coming back from spring break I think everyone just decided to live life to the fullest or something. Friday night I had a headache and there wasn't much going on so I decided to stay in. I was watching a bunch of movies and it wasn't half bad to just relax, but Doug called me and said there was a campusview party and I figured why the hell not, so I got dressed and headed out. That was awesome as usual... and nobody got MIP's at this one. (Once upon a time there were 39... yes 39 MIP's given out at this apartment...) Saturday Charlotte came back from a tennis trip, so I got to catch up with her for a while, and then we went to ""The Big Free"" together. (Some bands play, they have soda and food, all free. No Mizzou ID required) The Urge played and it made my night. I love that band!! They were awesome, as usual. I mean... its The Urge... how could they NOT be? After the concert Charlotte and I went to a party off lake of the woods with my friend Eddie (who goes to Rolla) and some of his friends (I know, thats a hard chain.. but try to keep up) Lots of my friends ended up being there and I (of course) had a great time. 

Yesterday before I went to church Katie and Karen and I were all kidding about how we should switch room mates for the end of the year, and when I got back from church my door was locked and I thought they had moved my stuff around as a joke (like... ok! go move into the room across the hall!) but instead they had un bunked the beds and put them next to each other so its like a huge king sized bed or something. We aren't going to leave it like this for long... but it was really funny. The new bed is a lot of fun to play on... some friends came over last night and we were all goofing around and stuff... it was awesome.

This year will be over before I know it, and I am a little sad. I have had an awesome year and I don't want it to be over yet. Oh well, next year will be awesome also, as will this summer, and all the years to come."

"event","So I feel AMAZING right now! I just got done with my speech and now I am going to watch Mean Girls with a few of the girls. I am still sick, but I don't really care at this point. I only have a little bit of school left and I am not going to let this cold keep me down. I still might not go OUT out tonight... It depends on what everyone is doing and I still think getting dressed up could be a bad idea for my heath because I need to stay warm. Plus, Char is out of town, and Katie and Karen both have mom's weekend for their sororities so there might not be much going on big party wise anyway. 

This weekend I hope to lounge in my bed, stay in PJ's almost all weekend (well, ive done that all week anyway...) and finish a paper. Thats not to much to ask at all, and I think I can accomplish it. As for tonight, I guess I will just go with the flow."

"event","The weather has been terrible, and it is supposed to be cold and rainy all week. Our heater won't turn on anymore... which you wouldn't think is a problem... except katie and I have been freezing our asses off. I usually sleep in boxers and a tank top with the air on or the window open if its cold outside. Last night I slept in thick fleece lined pants, a long sleeved shirt, a hoodie, and socks... with an extra blanket. I think I am getting a cold, so that might be why I am freezing... and Katie thinks she is sick also.. but hers seems to be it bit worse. Anyway, I just feel like laying in bed under my covers and relaxing. School is SO close to being over, and before I know it I will be driving home (probably crying because I have had such an awesome year) to spend my summer with no real concerns other than hostessing (and that is NOT stressful if you couldn't guess that yourself) at the Erm. 

Right now Finals are looking manageable. No psych or english, so all I have to worry about is geology, speech, and ECON! AHHH! I have a plan that might just keep me sane through this all. I have a speech to give Friday, and a paper due a week from friday. I will work on the speech all week, and dabble with the paper. I plan on having the paper out of the way by Sunday night. (If I can put my mind to it I know I could have it done by then) After that I concentrate (alternating based on my sanity of the moment) on Econ with a little Geology thrown in there. Speech isn't until Friday so that has last priority. Of only 3 finals I have to take... the only comprehensive one is Geology, and everything we learned at the beginning of the year was easy so I think I will be alright.

I could use some stress relief. I need a warm bath and some confidence! I am hoping some exercise will suffice. Well I have some laundry to do if I don't want to be running around in the nude...."

Right now I am all alone because I wont let the girls drink in our dorm room anymore. We all got alcohol violations and I wasn't even drinking at the time. Thats the rules.. and I am simply not willing to risk that again. I don't want another stupid violation when I'm not doing anything wrong. So I had to tell all my friends that I don't want them to drink in here, and they were respectful but I still feel like I am being a bitch about it. I just don't really know to do about it... oh well. I am in the process of getting ready (I was feeling the make-up tonight... and I am not what you might call ""good"" at it yet... so it takes some time, and sometimes several tries. Tonight I forgot eye liner, but I don't feel like starting over so I am going to let it slide)

He was in a great mood and that rubbed off on me a little bit. I feel like we never really hang out anymore and that sucks because he is one of my best friends... so I am always really happy when we hang out. This is where the day really started to go downhill. When I came back to the room I just started to watch some TV and chill with the girls, and here I am... still watching TV and doing nothing... only we are all blah. If we could only get ""amped up"" (that is New Zealand for excited and ready to party) we could have a good time even without leaving... I just don't see that happening. I could go to a hotel with my brother and his friends... but I don't want to drive out there to watch them get drunk. (Its some people we went to high school with... and I like them.. but I really don't feel like walking in the rain)

"event","Last night White Trash Bash was AMAZING!!!! I went with all the girls I am living with next year and we all had a blast. There are about a million stories that I could write, but I am almost positive that all of them fall into the ""you had to be there"" category. At Westminster the dorm rooms are about 6 million times cooler than ours, its a wet campus, you can easily see from one end of campus to the other, and could walk it in about 3 minutes, 5 at most. Everyone's outfits were hilarious, and the fake tattoo thing was really popular. If you want to see pictures let me know, and I will e-mail them to you... or just go onto facebook and look me up for a quick preview. I had to drive Shannon's car home because she had been drinking a little, and I got an ""A+"" in driving... apparently I am good because I didn't kill the car once.

I woke up this morning and went tanning with Rachel and Cecilia. Because I needed to take a shower after that anyway I figured I should work out. I jogged 2 miles (that is so insane... I NEVER run... so 2 miles is a lot.) and did some leg lifts. WOOO!! I feel great right now and I am about to take a shower and then get ready for another GREAT night. If anyone wants to hang out give me a call."

I am just in a bad mood. I don't really have any reason.. I just am. So now that I have set the mood... Today my speech group met over here, and that went well. We fixed all that was wrong with the speech, and set up some transitions. Everything was fine until everyone left, and I got stuck re-numbering our outline. The guy who offered to do it last night did it drunk... and wrong if that wasn't implied by DRUNK. So whatever, I re-number the outline (which has to be in roman numerals up into the 20's... and there are the sub points also) So I knocked that out, and then I look at the sources, nobody wrote them in MLA format, and I absolutely refuse to look up every fucking web site and book to figure out how to do it.. so they are staying as is. (yes, a ""fuck"" was needed in that sentance. I'm sorry that I cussed but sometimes a harsh word better justifies how I might feel about a situation.. especially in this case.) So I am done with the speech now, I wash my hands of it. I still need to ""memorize"" my part (it is supposed to flow like conversation.. not be ""memorized"" so anyway you look at it I need to work on that...) but that shouldn't be hard. 

Now I have a paper to revise... again. I have been rewriting the same paper all semester. My english teacher is seriously mentally disabled. he can go 5 minutes and never open his eyes. The paper is FINALLY almost done, and this is a ""rough draft"" although its my 16th revision of it. (I don't literally know what revision, but I think it is in the teens... not an exaggeration). Now that I have vented...

I talked to my friend Mark this morning and we had a really good conversation about nothing in particular. He always makes me smile, and that is something I really cherish right now. It is a BEAUTIFUL day outside, and I might go run. (Mark convinced me that if I just stick with it I wont feel like I am going to pass out after a lap, so I am going to try my best.) 

Because I am having a bad day, I am going to make a list of things I want to do this summer. Hopefully I will be able to accomplish ALL of them... and not in any order other than how they come to my mind...

1) Go to Kansas City
2) Go to 6 Flags
3) Go to the art museum
4) Get (and keep) an AMAZING tan
5) Work 5 if not 6 days a week (even if it means getting a second job)
6) Go to the Zoo
7) Go to Chicago
8) Go out at night and not let being tired stop me from having a good time
9) Visit my brother and Wash U kids downtown
10) Read at least 6 books
11) Watch Dan Jones do Kung Fu
12) Keep in touch with all the girls from the dorm (even if we don't live in the same city or country for that matter)

Thats all I got right now... I'm sure I will think of more to add later"

I decided that it was better to try it and know what might happen than never give blood and assume. To my surprise the process wasn't bad at all. It was a little painful, but nothing bad. I had good support (someone to hold my hand... there is no way I could have just gone alone...) and I didn't pass out or feel really tired or anything. 

I finished a speech and a paper today, and I am feeling very accomplished. My paper is really shaping up, and I am proud of it. I mean, its not perfect, but I like how it is coming along. We have to write in stages, and all these set backs keep happening in class (there was almost a month when we didn't have class if you count spring break.) so its a very slow process. 

Wow.. what an update... well I guess I was really proud of myself for giving blood and I wanted to share..."

"event","Friday night the girls and I went to midway for a huge frat party. (Sig Ep, Farmhouse, Beta, and Phi Delt) That was fun and wild. Katie's camera fell into the foam pit, and they couldn't find it for almost an entire minute. They got lucky though, it started working again on saturday. I danced with a kid I went to high school with who didn't remember me, and also told me his name was aaron (and it wasn't). That cracked me up. I also saw some people from high school that I haven't seen in a while.. and its always fun to catch up with old friends. 

Saturday was BUSY! I went to Charlotte's tennis match with a friend in the morning (she kicked ass as usual) and then when I came back I found out that my friend Ryan (who I was going to a dance with) got another date, and he wanted me to go with his friend Doug instead. Doug is a fun kid, so I wasn't all that worried about it. I worked on revising a paper, got ready for the dance and just hung out with the girls all day. When Katie and I were almost ready to go (Katie went with someone too) Charlotte walked in. Somehow we decided she should go too so we called and got her a last minute date. All of us took pictures outside, and walked down the street with our dates (all the ""couples"" matched... it was funny) and it was similar to how all high school dances were. I had a blast, and I am pretty sure everyone else did also. When we came home I had to go to relay for life (actually Katie and Char did too) so we changed and headed down to Stankowski. Doug ended up walking with me, and the ryans all came by (Herbie, Greenaway, and Chaney) to hang out also. Lots of my drunk friends came by on their walk home. I had an amazing night, but I didn't get to bed until like 3:30 or 4, and I didn't get much sleep.

Sunday I woke up at.. yes thats right... 8:30 am. I couldn't sleep, so I got up and worked on my paper a little. I went to church at 11, layed out with Katie and studied econ, and then went to the mall with Shannon. I got this huge cookie sandwich with icing in the middle, I swear I looked like a 3 year old but that cookie was SO good that it didn't matter. When I came back to campus I had to go to Sig Ep to meet up with people from my speech class. We made some progress there and then FINALLY I came back to the dorm and studied econ until I passed out. 

Tonight I have my econ exam, then I need to continue to revise my paper (due Wednesday) and write my speech (due Friday). WISH ME LUCK! I am off to study"

On the last test I studied the on-line quizzes and the notes... and I just didn't feel prepared. I have been trying very hard this time, so if I don't ace this test I might explode. Studying rocks sucks enough without Katie dancing in my face... ok... that actually made me smile.. but STILL. 

On a positive note I have been really optimistic about living with Shannon next year. She called me today and we were even finishing each others sentences... and we NEVER even hang out. How scary is that? We decided that we will probably be those people that nobody else likes to be around because they have their own language. That is kinda how me and my cousin are, and although it may be annoying to be around I love it. Its just so much fun to have a bond like that with someone.

This weekend is going to be jam packed. I have an Econ test monday that I really need to do well on (if I can get a B or a B- I will be happy) and I plan on doing the majority of my studying for it thursday and friday. Friday night I don't have anything I have to do, but saturday I have relay for life and the Sig Tau formal. As soon as the dance gets out I am heading for relay for life, and I will be there until 6 am. I am hoping that I can get into an ok sleep pattern that night, but my econ test isn't until 6:30 at night on monday, so I can always take a nap before it. Needless to say sunday wont be the best studying day...

As if I don't have enough to think about already... I am concerned that I am to weak (physically). I have a case of water in the trunk of my car, and I have attempted to carry one from my car to my dorm before.. its no easy task. First off there are 5 levels of stairs, and then I have to walk all the way to my dorm... usually that doesn't seem like a long walk but with a case of water it is almost unbearable. I told my room mate I was going to ask someone to help me and she made fun of me... so I guess I am going to ""buck up"" (as she suggested) and get the water myself."

Last night I went to a play with Ryan that was weird, and I didn't really enjoy it. It was unnecessarily crude and just strange. It was about a half brother and sister who were in love... that was the longest 75 minutes of my life. Later we went frat hopping, and that wasn't very much fun. We started out at Phi Delt and katie and karen did shots from an ice luge... but the party wasn't that great. We couldn't even really tell why, because it was pretty big, and SHOULD have been fun... but we just weren't feeling it. We left and went to Phi Kap, and that would have been fun if I knew anyone there because they were hanging out playing beer pong, but they were all Katie's friends and nobody really introduced themselves or anything. I got hit in the face with a ping pong ball that strayed from the game, and that was the best part of that frat... I laughed my ass off and the guy was happy I took it so well, he was really scared that I would be pissed.

I love my job and I work with AWESOME people. In fact, when I go home those are the people I usually hang out with the most. Me and my cousin hung out a lot... we usually laugh constantly at things that other people don't find amusing, go to steak n shake, hang out with 30 year olds (he he he kim!!), you know all the stuff kids do on spring break. Shannon and I are going to a white trash bash with Kim (my cousin) soon... I can't wait for those pictures.

Easter was cool, I went to my Aunt's house and had a late lunch thing... Hung out with the family and all. My little cousins are a handful, I'm just not used having little boys around I guess. Driving back on easter wasn't the best idea ever.. I was really tired. Its ok... I like the drive.

I think that was the only weekend I can look back on all semester and say Damn... that was a fun weekend. (Granted I have had other good weekends, just not any that Friday through Sunday have been cool) Friday we went to Frank's house (Sig Tau) and hung out for a friends birthday party, and I got to hang out with some of the boys I hadn't seen in a while. I also got to meet a few of the guys girlfriends that don't go here... and that is always fun. I love meeting new people that you always hear about, especially when I know they have a really close relationship. Saturday Ryan and I went to Chevys, and then hung out at his place until we went to a party off Bearfield. That was a blast and I got to hang out with a bunch of my good friends, dance, and see some randoms too. Sunday I went with Doug and Ryan to a frat sorority swim meet thing, which was really funny and entertaining. Peoples shorts were coming off, people were hitting the ropes that divide the lanes, and others were not even close to being done while all the other teams were getting out of the pool.

Karen found a ""secret room"" (like wood paneled closets that lined one wall of the basement) and Katie got on a coffee table inside the closet and was dancing, then Karen would close and re-open the door to find Katie doing a new dance move each time. I cried I was laughing so hard... I also knew a bunch of the people at the party who I didn't know would be there, so that was cool catching up with them. Today was slow as usual. Homework, Church and dinner, watched a movie, and now I am off for more study time."

"event","I just had a really crappy dinner, but the company was awesome so I guess it balances out. I am going to do some hard core studying tonight, I got index cards because those work really well for me when I study. After I study I am going to bible study with Karen. We made a deal.. she came to mass with me and I am going to bible study with her. She is overwhelmed by catholics at Mizzou, apparently everyone she meets here happens to be catholic. 

Anyway, Katie and Karen downloaded itunes on their computers, and Katie is OBSESSED. She started at zero, and already has 3000 songs. This is in a span of around 3 days... Karen keeps making fun of her. They are also in a Facebook war to see who can get more friends, they are well above 300. Life in this dorm is crazy, and these girls are ALWAYS making me laugh about something. (You guys may not find that very funny, but I swear if you knew these girls you would laugh at it) Speaking of funny... my friend Adam has a post that says ""Adam and Mark's Rules of Sexual Baseball"" and they outline what base means what and a few other things.. I read it this morning and I laughed my ass off. If you want to look its awaterslideaway and its the post that has pictures at the bottom. 

OK- one last thing... does anyone know how to help me spice up my live journal? I can't even find a picture that will fit on it... if you know what you are doing please leave me a post or whatever.. thanks a bunch"

"event","So I had an amazing weekend in St. Chuck. Friday my mom and I went to Kohl's and then to Wash U for a concert thing. It was a group called the pikers, but they add in comedy. They were REALLY funny, me and my brother were laughing our asses off.. but my mom didn't really think it was as funny as we did. Saturday morning my mom and I went shopping at west county. I loved going shopping at a good mall! When I got home I took a really long bath (SOOO relaxing, baths are really the way to go.) That night I didn't go out either because all of my St. Chuck friends were at work until about 11, and I was sleepy by then. This morning I made AWESOME quesadilla's, and then came back to school!! This weekend was perfect, I relaxed, shopped, and SLEPT! Ahhh.."

"event","My dad came today to look at Jeffco and sign a lease. I had a huge lunch at Macaroni grill, and yes kids, I know this is insanely sexy... but I smell of garlic. I can't get it off me, its coming out of my pores. After all that we came back and my dad got to meet a few of my friends, and that was interesting. One of them thinks he (my dad) is awesome.. so I guess it went well. For signing with Jeffco I got a complimentary cup... so I highly recommend them. 

When I came back I talked to my mom for a while, and then Ryan came to pick me up and we went to this AWESOME park. It is a state park that has something called Devil's Icebox. Its like a cave with a stream and its really pretty. I can't wait to go there this spring, I really love parks and the drive is fun to get to this one too. I decided today there are a lot of things I want to do this semester/over summer. I want to go to the zoo, go to Merrimac (or any other major) Caverns, go to six flags, go horseback riding in Lake of the Ozarks.. thats all I have for now, but I am sure I will come up with more.

The past few days nothing really happened, I just hung out and what not. Last night I watched Napoleon Dynamite with my friend Chris, that kinda made my day. How can watching Napoleon not make you have a good day? We have a group of work friends and one of the guys hates the movie, the rest of us love it. We haven't really decided how he can not like it yet, but some people (my cousin and Shannon) are really mad about this. Its ok, he will LEARN to like Napoleon."

"event","Today was so awesome!! Econ was canceled, Karen and I got McDonald's, AND it was sunny and warm. I had a psych experiment at 4:15, and when I got out of it my back was killing me. It just hit me out of the middle of nowhere, and I could move. When I came back to the dorm I layed on the floor for over an hour, and aspirin didn't even help a little bit. I felt like a 55 year old woman, and it was really bothering me. I finally got rid of it by taking come extra strength pain medication (like a large dose of aspirin) she had left from getting her wisdom teeth pulled. 

I started my day off really bad, so I am glad it turned out ok. I broke my ipod last night, which could end up being an expensive mistake. I also really want to go home, and I don't see that happening any time soon. I want to go have some good food, hang out with my mom, and go shopping. Every time I feel homesick I remind myself that if Charlotte can do it I can, and she doesn't get to see her family for 4 more months. So I really can't complain, and I should make the best out of my situation. 

For now I am going to go to bed and pray I don't wake up with back pain again... I might have to go to student death (thats the health center...) if it wont go away but I REALLY don't want to because I can't imagine it being anything I would get medicine for. Goodnight... sweet dreams everyone!"

"event","Last night my room mate and I just watched a movie with a friend instead of going out. She is sick and I had to get up early because wanted to go to church and not have to worry about it later. I still have to go to the library and find 4 useful articles for my english class. Plus it was raining all night, and the only things I knew of to do were off campus. I hate driving in the rain... so If I was going to go out it would have had to been an amazing party. I had fun anyway, I caught up with my friend who is on the tennis team, worked on my New Zealand scrap book, and had a few drunken visitors late at night. 

I want to go shopping. I miss all of the St. Louis malls, Columbia SUCKS when it comes to shopping. They only have one mall, and its sub par. Its only one level, its set up in a weird way, and above all... all of the stores seem small. It reminds me of more of mid rivers mall rather than the Galleria or West county... and those are the malls I like. (I know its a weird subject to bitch about but I love just walking around malls even if i don't find anything I like. Me my mom and my brother all used to go shopping almost every saturday.. so I guess thats why I enjoy it so much.)

anyway, I better go get some lunch and head to the library... after all that I still need to work out, write my paper and eat dinner."

"event","some nights just don't turn out how you plan them. Some old friends were coming in town, and I thought tonight would be crazy and ""just like old times"" but it wasn't really like that at all... I still had a blast. The Baker Park boys came over to my friend Don's and I didn't even talk to my old friends. People change, and I guess they don't even really know me anymore. I have to say, tonight was a dissapointment. I was hoping to hang out with a few certain people who have turned out to really let me down. None-the-less I always enjoy my talks with Mike (one of the BP boys..) when he is drunk.. he always gets really serious and really goofy somehow all at once. We even sung ""afternoon delight"" at the top of our lungs... hard to believe any of these people were sober, but I swear we were. (some of us...)

Tomorrow should be really cool (day time at least) because its meant to be very warm, Ryan and Mike are going to call me to go to Chipotle, and I will be able to get my last stressful assignments out of the way.

I think I am going to get into my nice comfortable bed and drift to sleep. I didn't take a nap today and I am really feeling it right now. Goodnight children!!!"

"event","I had the most productive day ever. I worked out, did laundry, finished a power point presentation, memorized a speech, organized my room, and reviewed psych. I am very proud of myself right now, but I am also going nuts. I usually have more down time...

Katie and I started a war today. A war with one of the girls across the hall. The other day Karen (girl across the hall) dumped a cup of cold water on katie while she was in the shower. Today katie dragged me into the pranking and had me come with her to dump cold water on Karen, 2 glasses this time. We didn't stop there either, Katie stole her towel. (we live at the VERY other end of the hall, making a mad dash for your room just won't work) We were nice and brought it back to her, but now I just know that no shower is safe for pretty much the rest of the semester. If anyone has some good prank ideas please leave me a comment, because I would love to get some good ones in here. Katie and I already have a few ideas, but I wont write them out just in case...

This weekend I am not going home, so hopefully Columbia will have something cool going on. I would be really mad if I stayed and did nothing all weekend when I could have been sleeping, eating good food, and taking warm loving baths. Call me if you are having fun this weekend.. because I should be there. OK... I need to go to bed before I fall asleep at my computer. Goodnight!!!"

"event","Saturday night two of my friends came over drunk as hell and wrote some bad things on my friend Charlotte's door, well they were drunk enough to sign their real names, so we knew who wrote it. The word got back to them that we were mad, and last night they came over to apologize. They walked in with ""I'm sorry"" cards, flowers, and chocolate. They were so worried that we would be mad at them that they talked about what they could do that would make us forgive them for something like an hour, and then came over here with all those things. We weren't really that mad to begin with, but how cool was it that we got flowers?!

So tomorrow is ash wednesday... and you know what that means! (Actually, a lot of people probably don't) Lent is here! This year I decided to give up chocolate. For most people that might not be that big of a deal, but I have become a chocoholic, and I am not ashamed to admit it. My room mate Katie and I will be going to mass at 5:30 if anyone wants to join us. Embrace your Catholicism children!

I was planning on going home this weekend, but now it doesn't look like I will be able to. My mom informed me today that it is supposed to rain/snow this weekend, so ""we will have to keep an eye on the forecast and see what happens"". That probably means I'm not going home. I was really stoked about it, but it will be cool to stay because one of my friends will be back early from her tennis match and will actually be able to go out on saturday night. This is a big deal, because she is always gone and we never hang out anymore. 

I talked to my dad today about coming and seeing my apartment complex and signing a lease. He is coming to Columbia not this Thursday, but the Thursday after. This means a big lunch at Macaroni Grill, and I know you are all jealous so don't even try to act like you aren't."

I have discovered the most self-absorbed, Mary Sue-ish, pretentious, adolescent writer ever to wet herself over an Anne Rice novel.  <A HREF=""http://www.authorhouse.com/BookStore/ItemDetail.aspx?q3=FjfZuye0jpI%253d"">Go read</A> this chick's bio.  Read the damn 'preview' of her book, while you're at it, too.  There are so many things to snark at, I just don't know where to begin."

"event","When I was twelve years old, I read <I>The Odyssey</I> for the first time, and I fell in love.  But even as I sat there, loving it, I was discontent.  Why?  Because this epic was supposed to be <I>poetry</I> and as long as I was reading it in translation, I wasn't reading it in all of its original glory.

And so I set myself a goal.  One day, I would read <I>The Odyssey</I> in Homeric Greek.  I haven't set many goals for myself in life, I haven't had many dreams I longed to fulfill.  In fact, this was pretty much it.

And now I'm <I>doing</I> it.  And it's <I>glorious</I>.  My dream is actually coming true.

Which is scary.  'Cause I'm only twenty, and <I>my dream is already coming true</I>.  I mean, what do you do when your one and only life goal has been achieved by the end of your second decade on Earth?  Where do you even go from there?  Methinks it's time to start looking for a new dream..."

"event","Franco is going to drive me over the edge.  He really, truly is.  That man is a basket case and he is destroying all his students.  The latest on the ever-growing pile of Franco-related crap: we recieved an email this morning (as in, five minutes ago) saying that he expects us to sit a mock exam at two o'clock this afternoon.  This, to me, sound about as realistic as if he had demanded that I learn to be a professional contortionist.  I actually believe that it is a physical impossibility that I will sit down in a room at two o'clock and take this exam.  I simply can't wrap my brain around it.

Yes, I know it's a mock.  

If you knew how seriously Franco and the college take mocks, you would not blame me for tearing my hair out.  Possibly we will stage a mass boycott."

"event","Before my very eyes, the boy-god Pan stepped out of Greek myth and onto the streets of Cambridge.  I have never seen so beautiful a boy in all my life.  Normally, I find beauty in a male to be on the laughable side, but this boy...

He had dark olive skin, and his black hair was short and curling.  His eyes were strikingly light brown-- almost yellow-- and he had long, dark eyelashes.  His face, oh!-- his face!  Delicate, slightly wild, like a faun-turned-human.  And the way he moved, quickly, smoothly, like a startled deer.

I saw him for all of ten seconds, perhaps.  They are burned into my memory.  I wish I could freeze time and look at him forever.  No, I don't!  If I did that I'd lose the beauty of his movement.  I have no words to describe his beauty."

"event","And furthermore, I've been scrolling about through other peoples' journals, and they are all admirably political and socially conscious.  And I applaud you all.  As for me, I choose not to write about politics.  No point, for one thing.  The only folks reading this are already responsible-types and don't really need me to help them on that score.  And besides, I'm sick to death of politics and politicians.  I don't mean to say I intend to cease being a responsible citizen and participating in my government, but frankly, I can't be arsed to devote my free brainwaves to a load people who, on the whole, make me sick.

So, I was reading Plato's ""Phaedo"" in which he talks about the Form of Equality.  (Y'all know the theory of Forms, yes?) And I was just wondering: if the Forms are contained, indivisible, independent whatchamacallits, how can the Form of Equality exist?  Doesn't Equality, by it's very nature, require a relationship between two things-- objects, ideas, whatever?  I'm a bit stumped on this one.  Anyone got any ideas?"

From <I>The Oxford History of Greece and the Hellenistic World</I> quoting from a fragment of Simonides.  This is Danae, talking to Perseus.  And, just to give you an idea of what a complete nerd I am, I tried it with the next book that came to hand as well, and came up with this:

""me, me, adsum qui feci, in me conuertite ferrum, o Rutuli!""

This is from Aeneid IX, and is Nisus' particularly heart-wrenching cry as he tries to save Euryalus from the Rutulians who have captured him.  Nisus would have got away if he hadn't called out.

Euryalus is a bit of a git, though..."

Got resevations about this?  Don't support the war?  Afraid you'll end up sending books to some creep who participated in the events at Abu Ghraib?  That's a good concern to have.

Yes, well, I've never been very good at keeping these things.  And I'm uncomfortable publishing my life and doings across cyberspace.  Also (and this is a bit odd) I feel that it would be massively vain for me to do so.  Hubris.  A sort of proclamation that my everyday life is that important.  Yet, at the same time, I don't feel this is true for all the people who do post their lives and doings on LJ.  I say to myself, ""Well, they need a stress release, or a place to put the events of the day down in black and white in order to get a good objective look at it, or it's an easy way for them to keep up with far away friends.""  Yet I seem incapable of applying this to me.  

Ah well!  I just like to post at deleterius and store nice poetry here.  Speaking of which...

<U>Lament</U>
Listen, children:
Your father is dead.
From his old coats
I'll make you little jackets;
I'll make you little trousers
From his old pants.
There'll be in his pockets
Things he used to put there,
Keys and pennies
Covered with tobacco;
Dan shall have the pennies
To save in his bank;
Anne shall have the keys 
To make a pretty noise with.
Life must go on,
And the dead be forgotten;
Life must go on,
Though good men die;
Anne, eat your breakfast;
Dan, take your medicine;
Life must go on;
I forget just why.

<U>Souvenir</U>
Just a rainy day or two
In a windy tower,
That was all I had of you--
Saving half an hour

Marred by greeting passing groups 
In a cinder walk,
Near some naked blackberry hoops
Dim with purple chalk.

I remember three or four 
Things you said in spite,
And an ugly coat you wore,
Plaided black and white.

Just a rainy day or two
And a bitter word.
Why do I remember you 
As a singing bird?

Both of these are by Edna St. Vincent Millay.  This poet breaks my heart, though most sad poetry doesn't."

"event","I've been thinking of looking this up for a while now, and I finally did, in an idle moment.  You know that song that Algy and Jack sing in the movie version of ""The Importance of Being Earnest""?  Well it's actually a poem by Oscar Wilde, which they put to music.  Here's the poem in its entirety:

Serenade(For Music)
The western wind is blowing fair
Across the dark AEgean sea,
And at the secret marble stair
My Tyrian galley waits for thee.
Come down! the purple sail is spread,
The watchman sleeps within the town,
O leave thy lily-flowered bed,
O Lady mine come down, come down! 

She will not come, I know her well,
Of lover's vows she hath no care,
And little good a man can tell
Of one so cruel and so fair.
True love is but a woman's toy,
They never know the lover's pain,
And I who loved as loves a boy
Must love in vain, must love in vain. 

O noble pilot, tell me true,
Is that the sheen of golden hair?
Or is it but the tangled dew
That binds the passion-flowers there?
Good sailor come and tell me now
Is that my Lady's lily hand?
Or is it but the gleaming prow,
Or is it but the silver sand? 

No! no! 'tis not the tangled dew,
'Tis not the silver-fretted sand,
It is my own dear Lady true
With golden hair and lily hand!
O noble pilot, steer for Troy,
Good sailor, ply the labouring oar,
This is the Queen of life and joy
Whom we must bear from Grecian shore! 

The waning sky grows faint and blue,
It wants an hour still of day,
Aboard! aboard! my gallant crew,
O Lady mine, away! away!
O noble pilot, steer for Troy,
Good sailor, ply the labouring oar,
O loved as only loves a boy!
O loved for ever evermore! 


Laura, if you comment on this, and your comment contains any swooning over Colin Firth, I swear I will give up on you forever."

"event","""He did not wring his hands, nor weep,
Nor did he peek or pine,
But drank the air as though it held
Some healthful anodyne;
With open mouth he drank the sun
As though it had been wine!

...

Oh happy they whose hearts can break
And peace of pardon win!
Oh else may man make straight the plan
And cleanse his soul from sin?
How else but through a broken heart
May Lord Christ enter in?

And he of the swollen purple throat
And the stark and staring eyes
Waits for the holy hands that took
The thief to Paradise,
And a broken and a contrite heart
The Lord will not despise.

...

The man in red who reads the Law
Gave him three weeks of life,
Three little weeks in which to heal
His soul of his soul's strife,
And cleanse from every blot of blood
The hand that held the knife.

And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,
The hand that held the steel:
For only blood can wipe out blood
And only tears can heal,
And the crimson stain that was of Cain
Became Christ's snow-white seal.""

--Oscar Wilde, <I>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</I>


I love that poem so much...!  ""With open mouth he drank the sun, as though it had been wine!""  The third verse that I copied down is a reference to Psalm 51: ""Sacrifice to God is a contrite spirit, a crushed and humbled heart God will not spurn.""  That's my favorite Psalm, far and away.  Though many people find the opening line of 22 interesting.  Hehe!  I'm feeling all literary!

But I'm getting a bit tired of Met III.  Good stories and all, and nice, easy translation, but Juno keeps picking people off because their mother's sister's aunt's cousin slept with Jupiter.  She has revenge issues.

It's now half past four in the morning, and I've got to get up at nine to go to Church.  Methinks a bit of sleep is in order..."

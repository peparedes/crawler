"event","Yea so I'm totally moving.  Which is kick ass.  Our house is already so awesome looking and we've all hardly moved in yet. Its this rad 4 bedroom/2 bathroom house in the ghetto.  But its only about 4 blocks from Hairy Marys so I can just walk home when I get drunk.  I'm living with 3 other kids that I've only met a few times so hopfully it all works out.  But I'm working 2 jobs (maybe 3 now since I still have to pay my sister for storing all my shit) so I'll hardly ever be home.  I'll be sending the new address when I do my Christmas cards. My sister disconnected the internet and we don't have it hooked up at the house yet, so I'm only online for about 10 minutes a day when I'm at work.  But hey, you all got my digits if you need em and my e-mail at work is julie.k.finch@wellsfargo.com. Feel free to e-mail me all day long cuz I'm soooo bored at work.  Would just like to throw a shout out to Brandon for giving me the hookup on my new place.  Also thanks to Adam for letting me use his computer at work.  Thanks to Ed and Jordan in advance for helping me move my bed and dresser (please??  I'll buy you pizza and beer).  The Alpah Evan and The Jew for making me kick ass cd's to listen to since I have no internet to entertain me.  Scott for never sending me a gay synth pop cd.  MaryAnn for pissing in front of Platinum Kuts.  Jenny for not getting killed and skinned by Joe. Neight is in town and we were going to go celebrate the 1 year renewing our friendship anniversary but he's tired from driving all day so we're gonna go out tomorrow night.  And then its off to Luckys on Saturday I do belive.  And yea.....I gotta keep this short and stuff.  Hopfully I'll be back online in a few weeks, but I'm gonna start hitting the library to use the computers there.  But sadly...no AOL IM...*tear*"

<font size=1>Scourage of many misunderstood weakling in the last century, the tapeworm can grow up to 30ft inside its human host's alimentary canal, and shed a million eggs a day.  It is a voracious beast, eating all the food you eat before you can get it.  So you get starving and eat more.  Which feeds it more, making it grow more.  As it grows, so it eats more of your food.  Until you die of malnutrition.  It will then encyst itself (nest) in the eye or brain.  Then it laughs.</font>

<font size=1>This sandy-coloured servant of the Church is just like other servants of the Church in that it irritates you when you've sinned.  Unlike vicars, however, they swing using claw-like single-toed feet from pubic hair to hair, before settling, sucking your blood and laying eggs under your epidermis (outer skin).  This causes itching, guilt, being busted, claims you 'must've got them from sharing a towel' ect.  Racing them is a favoured pursuit of shut-in smack addicts.</font>

<font size=1>The heads of these worms look like some monster out of a horror movie.  The mouth parts are designed to bite onto the lining of your intestine, scrape and rub away the surface and begin to suck your blood.  Many people who are infected show no outward symptoms of illness-signs of disease depend on the number of worms inside you.  As they breed, though, you will go blind, incontinent, mad, then die of starvation.  Eating will not save you.</font>

"event","In October 25, 2002, Auckland police rushed to the scene of a suspected homicide only to discover a severed leg swinging from a back door was being cured as an amputee's souvenir. A woman called police to say she could see a severed human leg hanging from a neighbor's back door. Police spokesman Jed Oskam said her belief that this was a real leg was supported by the presence of a large number of flies ""which were showing an inordinate interest in the object"".  Officers raced to the scene to find a severed human leg, from knee to foot, hanging in the back yard of a residential address.  While police were asking an occupant of the house who the leg belonged to and what their condition was, a man limped in. ""Police could not help noticing that he had only one leg. This immediately aroused their interest."" The man explained to the stunned police that his leg had been amputated two months earlier. A week ago he asked the hospital to return his leg and it obliged.  ""The man said that he was salting and hanging the leg in order to preserve it as a memento,"" Mr. Oskam said. Police had no reason to disbelieve his story as the leg appeared to form a matching pair with the one on which he was standing.  The police asked the man to ""cure"" the leg away from public view to avoid attracting more attention.

Isn't that a great idea?  That's exactly what I'd want to do with my leg... but
somehow I'm doubting that they'd let you have the leg here in the U.S.  But
that's just not right... It belongs to you, it's a part of you, if you want to
keep it as a curio, you should be able to.  Anyone want to do some legal
research and see if you can get away with something like this here?  If not,
there's yet ANOTHER reason to move to New Zealand..."

Yesterday Adam and I went to Omaha.  Danish Windmill, 3 hardcore cd's, Nishnabotna River, and 10 dead deer later we arrived.  Hit the old market where I purchased a little something for a lady in the Jose of San California.  I hope she smokes...or at least likes to start fires.  So yea, send me your address and I will get it out to you this week.  Also purchased a FATA shirt, a Vargas Girls shower curtain, some bitchin belt buckles, and some sunglasses so I can wear them at night...just like Corey Hart.  I think he was the guy who sang that song.

Worked today.  Lots to catch up on from being gone on Friday.  Boring, but I got to listen to my new cd's.  Home.  Walked the dogs.  Watched dogs chase a deer.  Watched deer hit chainlink fence looking for a way out.  Repeatedly.  Over and over again.  It was just like a bird hitting a window, lots of force.  Deer finally gives up and runs in other direction.  That goes on the list of ""the funniest and saddest"" things I've seen.  Came home.  Made some soup. Burned some cd's for Evan.  Chatted with Ken.  Talked him into visiting me at work tomorrow before he goes to the Between The Buried And Me/A Life Once Lost/The End/Coma Eternal show at the Botan.  Grrr that stupid 2nd job always getting in the way of shows.

Went and saw the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie this evening.  Best part about the movie you ask?  Going with Punk Rock Rick and sneaking in the backdoor without paying, and calling some kid in a Leatherface halloween mask ""lame."" 

I'm not really sure if I liked the movie or not.  I mean it was a different take on the whole thing.  You actually know why Leatherface is as fucked up as he is.  Apparently he has some sort of rare skin dieseas that makes his face look like he belongs in Slipknot...or he's done way to much coke and his nose has rotted off.  Whichever?!?!  I guess I really liked the mystery surrounding Leatherface that the first movie gave you.  Hrm.  But Lee Ermy was really great as the foul mouthed sherif..Damn his one liners cracked me up.  Jessica Biel was very good in it I thought.  Very convincing that she was scared shitless.  My one main complaint.  The apperance of the new Leatherface sucks.  See, old Leatherface had a nice mop of brown curly hair.  New Leatherface has more of a sandy brown backcomb that looks exactly my Monopoly cheating whore of a Grandma.  And the fact that he was wearing one of the kid's face for a mask just wasn't really doing it for me.

I guess all in all I'm glad I went and saw it...I think not having to pay helped a little bit too.

Saw the preview for the new re-make of Dawn Of The Dead.  Once again I will refrain from ranting about why it is neccessary to re-make fine pieces of cinema like that.  Also saw previews for the next Matrix and next Lord of The Rings.  

And now....

Which I don't watch cuz I'm to busy working 2 jobs and cruising for hookers down on 2nd avenue.  He was funny.  I would reccommend the show to anyone and everyone who wants to be offended.  He was really drunk on stage which made it a lot better.  Reminded me a lot of Lewis Black...with the yelling rough voice and all.  

Then we went to Perkins.  I had some southwestern eggrolls.  I feel bad because he is only in town because he is waiting for his sister to die.  But he said he can't wait for it to happen.  I don't know.  I guess I don't really know how to feel. She is still awake sometimes so its not like shes comepletely and totally gone yet.  I guess I don't have to deal with it on a 24 hour basis so I have no reason to judge.  

He opened the car door for me, only when I was getting in...not getting out.  I liked that.

Saturday we are going to the strip club.

Jenny:  He had socks with roses on them? Please tell me he has super long hair?

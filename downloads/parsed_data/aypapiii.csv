"event","i feel like i went through a dozen break-ups in a month.
talk about being hit by a truck. 

i'm numb. can't feel a thing. i haven't cried that much, even. 

i love you. you gave up. i can't believe you did. maybe because i know you didn't."

"event","loving thyself and being the best that i can be.
this will be my life theme from now on.

to love and be loved in return.
this will be my wish UNTIL it comes true.

to be strong for others when the situation calls for it.
this is how i shall be from now on.

i will be waiting.
hoping is never a bad thing."

"event","hung out with the girls last night. nothing but fun! had too much to drink though. by the end of the night, i was so 'basag' already that i had to ask a friend to drive. i even made him pullover to the side (even though we're just a few meters away from the condo) so i can throw up. yes, it's that bad.

the girls slept over. i found myself waking up on the floor. haha.
---
then again.
after that temporary high.
i get back to reality.

i miss HIM. so much. now we're not even talking.
it's hard to get out of a relationship where both of you still have strong feelings for each other, when both of you still love (and are still very much IN love with) each other. it really isn't the right time, i suppose. 

i'm just scared of the waiting. i don't want to be miserable until that time comes, when we'll be together again.

i'm living my life holding on to his promises. i'm living my life in faith and in hope. that's how i get through each day right now."

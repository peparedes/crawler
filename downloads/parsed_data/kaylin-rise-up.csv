"event","<strong>What&rsquo;s a simple activity that consistently contributes to your positive body image?<br /></strong><br />Yoga and aquafit. Being active makes me appreciate what my body is able to do and that it is relatively healthy.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>What&rsquo;s something you know now about body image that you didn&rsquo;t know when you were 18 years old?<br /></strong><br />Yes, that I need to accept and love the way I look RIGHT NOW! When I think back to my body image when I was 18 I feel sad that I didn't realize how smoking hot I was. I was slender and youthful and I wish I could have appreciated that then, but it's the past, so now I am working to appreciate it now.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Is there anything you find yourself doing repeatedly that gets in the way of your body image?<br /><br /></strong>Yes. I compare myself to other people way too often. Both my body vs theirs and also their accomplishments vs mine. It makes me feel insecure and envious. I am working on not comparing myself to others, but rather identifying what I like about myself or what I would like to work on in myself.<strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>Is there a body image mantra or motto (or any kind really) that you&rsquo;ve found very helpful? (Gretchen uses the motto &ldquo;Be Gretchen.&rdquo;)<br /><br /></strong>Not so much a mantra, but by working on focusing on how I feel physically right now, in the present, it's helping me to be more appreciative of my health and my body. I mean, it's pretty awesome how well it works. I am great at crafts and drawing and that's because I have extremely coordinated hands that I have developed fine motor skills in. I also appreciate my long strong legs. I can walk great distances and walk quickly. That's something to be grateful for.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Have you always felt about the same level of body image, or have you been through a period when you felt exceptionally better about your body and yourself as a whole  &ndash; if so, why? If you were unhappy with your body or yourself, how did you become happier?<br /></strong><br />Right now my body image is the best it's been except for a period in 2007-2008. I was thin at that point and walking a lot.&nbsp;<br /><br />Currently I am happier because I am taking care of myself, I am developing daily practices of gratitude and I am working on being in the present.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Have you ever been surprised that something you expected would make you feel better about yourself, didn&rsquo;t &ndash; or vice versa?<br /></strong><br />I have been so surprised how good yoga has made me feel about myself. I haven't been in 4 days and I am feeling awful, but I wasn't free for any of the classes over the weekend and I am now sick. I didn't expect that it would make me love my body the way it has. It needs to be a regular practice for me.&nbsp;<br /><br />Losing weight actually does make me feel better about myself, but my difficulty in maintaining weight loss makes me feel bad. I sometimes assume that new clothes will make me feel better about myself, but they usually don't<br /><br /><br />Taken from here.&nbsp; http://blogs.psychcentral.com/weightless/2011/01/essential-body-image-questions-to-ask-yourself/"

"event","I love love love love love canada day. <br /><br />In my opinion it is the best holiday. Here are my reasons. <br /><br />1) It's a holiday with no expectations. No big dinners, no long lists of presents to purchase, no unrealistic expectations, and no commitments. <br /><br />2) It's in the summer, close to the solstice. The day is so long and usually beautiful. I can't remember yucky weather on Canada day. That may be selective memory, but I don't care. In my mind, it is always beautiful July 1. <br /><br />3) I almost always have fun on July 1 (I can think of one notable exception, but I'm not going to include it here). Last summer I spent it with my dad and sister. 2008 at a show with Blake. 2007 was my favourite canada day. I spent it on the Edmonton Queen River Boat. MBP played. We watched the fireworks from the river. It was beautiful. <br /><br />4) THE HIGHLEVEL BRIDGE TURNS INTO A <span style=""font-size: larger""><span style=""color: #000080"">WATERFALL</span></span>!!!! <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.yedmonton.ca/teen/images/11795_400.jpg"" /><br /><br />5) Free pancakes and cake everywhere you turn. <br /><br />6) Canadian flags everywhere. We are no where near as flag crazy patriotic as our southern neighbours, so when Canadians bust out their flags, you better believe it's for a good reason. <br /><br />7) Swearing in of new Canadian citizens at the ledge! <br /><br />8) The strong sense of national pride. <br /><br />9) This is a day where I remember how special our multiculturalism is. It's neat to see such diversity of our people. All partying down cause we love our sweet nation!! Oh yeah!<br /><br />10) And my absolute most favourite part of this special day... <br /><br /><br /><font color=""#ff00ff"" size=""7"">F<span style=""color: #ff6600"">I</span><span style=""color: #00ffff"">R</span><span style=""color: #339966"">E</span><span style=""color: #800080"">W</span><span style=""color: #ffff00"">O</span><span style=""color: #333399"">R</span><span style=""color: #00ff00"">K</span><span style=""color: #ff99cc"">S</span>!<span style=""color: #ff9900"">!</span></font><span style=""color: #cc99ff""><font color=""#ff00ff"" size=""7"">!<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://photos.edmonton.ca/Holidays/Canada-Day-Fireworks-2009/CanadaDay2009fireworks-001/715055618_umbgq-M.jpg"" /><br /></font></span><br />"

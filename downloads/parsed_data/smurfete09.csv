I didn't eat all day long and then for dinner I had a huge steak. I drank water all day long, about a gallon's worth. </p><p>But I only lost .2 l s this morning.

"event","<p>So altogether I lost 21.4lbs. I thought I might have screwed everything up yesterday because I was bad. I had pizza. And a small bag of sun chips. Jacob didn't help either. Cause I say, pizza sounds good and he volunteered with I can pick one up. After 24 days I didn't have anymore will power. So I was bad. But that's all I ate all day. I didn't allow myself to have anything else. </p><p>Today starts day one of the stabilization phase. I'm thinking tuna salad for lunch. Not sure about dinner yet.

I have stuck to this diet, and I haven't cheated (other than a small bite of candy my boss force fed me and the tiniest sip of a frozen coffee). I've stayed dedicated even though I have to make ALL my meals (except cottage cheese), which isn't the most convenient... But I've done it!

So I'm looking forward to this one. The next one I have after getting under 190 is to lose 20 lbs which I only have another 3.4 pounds to go until I accomplish that. So I could potentially achieve both of these. :0)</p><p>Today will be a little difficult. I have a soccer game at 11 for my daughter. And then I have a shopping date with my future mother in law at 2. So I'm probably just going to have cottage cheese for lunch and take it with me. And maybe and apple, because it's easy to eat in the car. </p><p>Last night I was VERY proud of myself.

I haven't eaten it in forever since Jacob doesn't like fish, but he was willing to try. I cut six slices of a lemon and lauds it on the bottom of my pan, seasoned the fish with garlic salt, pepper, and some garlic & herb seasoning I have. Then I laid the fish on the lemon slices and then squeezed some lemon juice on top. I covered the pan with tin foil and baked it at 350 for 40 minutes. It was delicious. (to me, Jacob tried a bite but didn't really like it)</p><p>I then made an crustless apple pie for our fruit. It was pretty tasty. And very easy. Sliced apples (1 per person) in a pan tossed with a little lemon juice and cinnamon, then the crumbly topping is a piece of melba toast (per serving), nutmeg, cinnamon, a dash of allspice, and a dash of ginger mixed with a T of milk. That's sprinkled over the top, cover and bake at 400 for 20 minutes. Then uncover and put in the broiler for 2 minutes to crisp the topping.

"event","Really this is for my fellow cooks...

I tried a new recipe this morning for Peanut Butter Pancakes. I thought they would be interesting. And after making them, I realized they're missing something, but I can't quite figure out what. 

Recipe:

2 cups all purpose flour
2TBSP Sugar
1/4 tsp salt

Combine these in a large mixing bowl


In a smaller bowl combine:

3/4 cup of peanut butter (creamy)
2 eggs slightly beaten

after these are combined slowly add in 

2 cups of milk



After the peanut butter mixed is well mixed add it to the dry mixture. Combine until slightly lumpy. It may be a little runny at first, but it will stiffen up after sitting for a few minutes. 


Heat a lightly greased pan. 

Make pancakes as normal. This should make about 16 pancakes, unless you make them the size I do, then it's like 9. :o)



They're really not light and fluffy. They're very heavy. And VERY filling. Generally I can eat 3 or 4 pancakes. I had 1 and already felt full. But they leave something to be desired. I just can't figure what else I could put in there. 

They do say to add peanuts, but I don't like crunchy pancakes, so I opted to leave them out."

It may not be exciting to you, but it is to me. I've been trying to get Eric to get pictures done with Kayli and I since about a year ago, and he's always said no. And I emailed him the other day with the idea of us getting family pictures done for Christmas since alot of people on my side of the family have yet to see him, cause they all live out of state. Also because I want family pictures. And I said that could be my Christmas present, since I really want them, and he said it sounded like a good idea!!! I'm so excited!!!!!

I can't wait!

Ok, I'm done now, I just wanted to share."

"event","A long time ago, I wrote a section on randomness for FreeBSD's <a href=""http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=random&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+8.2-RELEASE&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html""><code>/dev/random</CODE> manpage</A> - you can find it by scrolling down to the section called ""RANDOMNESS"". I wrote it because arguments about randomness often seem to crop up on mailing lists, and people end up talking at crossed purposes because ""randomness"" has several meanings, and unless you agree which aspect of randomness is important, you're unlikely to reach agreement about how to implement it.

For example, <a href=""http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/arts/jsw_art_rand.aspx"">Julienne Walker's article</A> gives some interesting advice on the use of the C <code>rand()</CODE> function. I think the author's focus is on uniformity, but that isn't clear, and they don't spell out why each code snippet is good or bad. I think they assume that <code>rand()</CODE> actually returns ints uniformly in the range 0..RAND_MAX, and are worried about how to map that uniformly into a number of boxes.

If that's the case, then <code>rand()%N</CODE> is slightly bad because if N doesn't divide RAND_MAX, then the lower numbers in the range will have slightly more weight. Also scaling <code>rand()</CODE> by using division won't help, because the number of outcomes in 0..RAND_MAX simply can't be mapped evenly into 0..N. This is why the trial-and-discard version works, because it throws away the outcomes that don't map into the range. There's a slightly more efficient version of this discard code used to implement <code> arc4random_uniform()</CODE>, where you reduce the probability of rejecting outcomes by packing as many copies of 0..N into 0..RAND_MAX as possible, which makes sure the probability of acceptance is at least 0.5.

I think the floating point uniform deviates code given in the article will not produce uniform output in the limit, because it maps 0..RAND_MAX outcomes to 0..N. However, the mean will be pretty close to right, so if you're using your outcomes as numbers, rather than discrete boxes, the difference won't be so bad. I can't say I understand the integer version of the uniform deviate code that's given in Julienne's article - it just looks like you couldn't depend on it working for a host of rounding/truncation issues.

[I also don't really understand the problem with seeding from <code>time_t</CODE>. In C99, <code>time_t</CODE> is an arithmetic type, so you can have a go at converting it to an unsigned int. It's true, that its units might not be seconds, so the resolution might not be good. I guess <lj user=""fanf""> could tell me?]

<a href=""http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.jones/GoodPracticeRNG.pdf"">David Jones's advice</A> is also worth looking it. It's fairly clearly focused on numerical simulation, which mainly needs to get samples in the right part of the numerical range. I mostly agree with the device here, but I'm not convinced that people should write always implement their own RNG, because writing portable code is hard. With that in mind, I had a read through the code, looking for portability issues, and there are some (<lj-cut text=""Read more"">).

Relative to C99, I noticed the following things:<ul><li>The code assumes unsigned ints are 32 bits wide, but C99 only requires them to be wider than 16 bits.
      <li> a modern compiler should provide <code>uint32_t</CODE> and <code>uint64_t</CODE> for unsigned 32 and 64 bit ints respectively, providing they are supported by the compiler. I'm not sure who uses <code>_int64</CODE> - maybe windows?
      <li>JKISS32 will have undefined behaviour on overflow when evaluating <CODE>t</CODE>, because it is a signed variable. It might also assume two's complement representation of signed numbers.
      <li><CODE>devrand()</CODE> assumes that <code>sizeof(unsigned int)</CODE> is 4, and might set padding or parity bits to invalid values (though it uses <code>open()</CODE>, <code>read()</CODE> and <code>close()</CODE>, so it is outside C99).
      <li>The code that generates doubles assumes that <code>DBL_MANT_DIG</CODE> is 53.
      <li><code>uni_qsingflt()</CODE> and <code>uni_qdblflt()</CODE> are indeed unportable - aside from assuming things about the layout of ints and floats, it also tries to change the value of a float by changing an int. This breaks the strict aliasing rules, and newer versions of gcc will produce code that doesn't give the desired result. Gcc 4.4 generates warnings for this: <pre>dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
dereferencing pointer 'x.2' does break strict-aliasing rules
dereferencing pointer 'x.0' does break strict-aliasing rules</PRE> I guess it would be better, and maybe faster, to use the <code>ldexp()</CODE> functions for this, which are part of C99.
      <li>The example using <code>random()</CODE> to generate doubles assumes that <CODE>random()</CODE> returns numbers in the range <code>0..RAND_MAX</CODE>, but this is what <CODE>rand()</CODE> does. <CODE>random()</CODE> returns numbers in the range 0..(2**31)-1.
      <li>No test code for the rng was included to make sure it had been correctly compiled on a given platform.
</UL>Relative to C89, there'll be the additional issue that long longs are not standardised.

One minor niggle, which isn't so much a portability issue is the following. The text says ""32-bits are not enough to generate all possible double precision float values between 0 and 1"", however the code given only generates 2^53 numbers between 0 and 1, when there are 2^53 doubles for each exponent, and all exponents<  0 give a double value less than one. Since the mantissa for doubles is usually 10 bits for a double, the code given is about 9 bits short of generating all normalised doubles less than 1. (Plus, you could generate denormalised numbers too.) However, I don't think there are many floating point RNGs that bother to cover this corner.

Finally, I guess these functions aren't thread safe, but, again neither are most of the standard implementations..."

Checking in Google Groups, I found <A HREF=""http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/0c84b5e7e72a4395?dmode=source"">a post</A> from 1985 from Jeffrey Mogul with the source code for a ping programme, originally written by  Larry Allen in November 1983.

In the historic BSD source code, it seems that ping appears about 1983, just after BSD 4.2. The version here is written by Mike Muuss and dated December 1983. December 1983 also brings RFC 889 by David Mills, which describes network delay experiments conducted between October and November 1983. It says that ""Among the various measurement packages is the original PING (Packet InterNet Groper)
program used over the last six years for numerous tests and measurements of the Internet system and its client nets."" There doesn't seem to be any mention of ping in the RFCs before that.

This hint lead me to <A HREF=""http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/ping.html"">Mike Muuss's page about ping</A>. It says that Mike wrote the ping command  in December 1983 after hearing Dave Mills describing using ICMP to measure delay in July 1983. Mike comments that he named it after the sound sonar made, but I'd guess that the name had been associated with the tool at this point.

Searching around, there are some <A HREF=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.protocols.tcp-ip/msg/06e614311de9a168?dmode=source"">articles</A> where Dave Mills claims credit for the term, having produced ping for the fuzzball routers in about 1980."

The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_2B_carcinogens"">list of possibly carcinogenic things</A> is quite interesting, and includes some nasty stuff (like petrol and lead) and some more everyday things (coffee and using talc on your nether regions).

I was rather disappointed to see that their report was not yet available.  A summary of the decision has turned up in <a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/onlinefirst"">Lancet Oncology Online</A>, and is <a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(11)70147-4/fulltext"">available for downloadable if you register</A>.

Both the article and the press release are worth a read. They say there's <em>limited</em> evidence (which means the results could be by chance) for an increase in certain cancers and <em>inadequate</em> evidence for others. Here <em>limited</em> and <em>inadequate</em> seem to be technical terms they use. The INTERPHONE study, which showed a 40% increase for the heaviest group of users, seems to have have split people into ten groups and used a 95% confidence interval on each group, so I guess they have a pretty good chance of getting some result by chance. The Swedish study they describe sounds a bit more convincing, and they skim over the details of some earlier studies that didn't show any correlations. A few members of the committee felt this evidence was <em>inadequate</em> rather than <em>limited</em>, so I should track down the papers and read them for myself.

Interestingly, they note that 3G can operate with much lower power than GSM (when the base station is close). I should check this out, as I don't know much about power control in 3G and GSM. I wonder if that means femtocells could actually reduce your RF exposure?"

"event","<A HREF=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave_ratio"">VSWR</A> seems to be important to people who design antennas and radios - it's something to do with how much of the power your radio outputs actually makes it to the antenna and how much is bounced back into your radio. This can be bad for high-power radios, as you can fry parts of the electronics if too much power is reflected back. I got the basic idea of VSWR while studying for my lisence, but didn't really I'd understood what was being reflected and why.

Reflection of something usually relates to waves, and you usually have to be pretty careful how you think about waves 'cos they do weird stuff (like being refracted or reflected). My understanding of waves is somewhat limited, so I'd usually try to understand what's going on by writing down an equation for the system, and trying to figure out where the wave comes in.

For example, in a circuit with a resistor, inductor and a capicator you know that the sum of the voltage drops around the circuit is zero, and that V = IR for the resistor, V = q/C for the capicator and V = dI/dt L for the inductor, so if put all that together, you get a simple second order differential equation, and so has nice solutions in terms of sin and cos, so you get oscillations.

This approach for circuits works fine if you assume all your components are tiny, and so the voltage doesn't vary along them. I wasn't sure how you did this for wires when you're sending a signal along that has a wavelength comparable to the size of the wires. It seems you can basically do the same trick, but treating each bit of wire as a resistor and a inductor with a bit of capacitance between wires.  With a bit of work, you get a (partial) differential equation, which happens to be related to the wave equation.

Now, since a wire is a 1-dimensional system, you find that at each frequency there are basically two possibilities for the steady state: a wave goes one direction or the other direction.  If your radio puts a signal on the wire at one end, you imagine that you have some voltage source driving the signal in the direction you want. The full solution then has to be a sum of what you drive in one direction plus a wave in the other direction, which depends on the properties of the cable. You regard the wave going in the other direction as a reflection of your original signal. The sum of these two produces a standing wave in the voltage amplitude, which you can measure using a <A HREF=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWR_meter"">Voltage Standing Wave Ratio meter</A>.

The reason this is important is because if you design your parameters carefully enough, you get no reflected part, and all the power your radio produces ends up in the antenna, where you wanted it. This often called ""antenna matching"" or sometimes ""antenna tuning"", though tuning seems to be regarded as a misnomer, because you usually try and match the impedance of the radio, cable and antenna."

There's a video showing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOcjhB9UjMU"">the vortex trick</A>.

The vortex technique is supposed to be quicker than just emptying a bottle, because you get a gap in the middle of the vortex that lets the air in, so you don't get the glug-glug-glug that's associated with turning a bottle upside down. I though I'd check this, so I collected up some bottles, a stop watch, a bath full of water and a four year old helper.

Despite the measurement errors introduced by the combination of water and four-year olds, it seems fairly clear that it is faster to empty the bottles with the vortex method.

So, for a range of bottles (glass/plastic, long/short neck, round/irregular, ...) it probably is faster to empty them with the vortex effect. It also is more fun, which is why I'd wondered if the effect was just psychological in the first place."

<lj-cut>

page 8, in paragraph labelled ""The potential divider"": I think ""Fig
2.1"" should read ""Fig 2.4"".

page 10, last paragraph: I think ""photograph on page 7"" is actually
on page 10.

page 15, first col, top half: The second letter of XL, VL, XC and
VC should always be a subscript, but sometimes is not.

page 15, last col, last few paragraphs: The letter of RD should always
be a subscript, but sometimes is not.

page 16, middle col, top: ""Fig 2.29"" - should be 2.31?

page 18, middle col, second last paragraph: ""Fig 6.3"" should be ""Fig 3.3""?

page 19: The diode symbol is introduced on page 19, in the Fig 3.7.
However, it doesn't seem to be explained which way current can flow
across the symbol. The anode and cathode are labelled, but these
don't seem to be related to the N and P materials of the previous
section.

page 24, last col, paragraph headed ""The field effect transistor"":
""'n' type"" should probably have a bit ""N""?

page 28, middle col, paragraph headed ""SSB transmitter"": I think
""Fig 7.1"" should be ""Fig 4.1""?

page 28: Might be useful to say what AM, FM and SSB stand for in
second paragraph. AM is expanded in the third paragraph, but it
seems to make sense to expand them early and refer to the boxes.
The ""Simple FM VHF transmitter"" seems to suggest that FM means
""PHASE MODULATION"", which to my understanding similar but not the
same as FM.

page 30, last col: ""The Colpitts circuit of Fig 4.2"" - I think that
should be 4.3? The Colpitts circuit isn't really explicitly introduced.

page 33, first col, first paragraph: ""class A amplifier"" is mentioned
here. An earlier section (page 24) explains class A, B and C biasing,
but doesn't mention that these are also used to describe amplifiers.

page 36, first col, second last paragraph: The frequencies mentioned
in this paragraph do not match the frequencies in Figure 4.20. For
example, the VFO in the picture runs from 7.8 to 8.35, but the one
in the text runs from 7.8 to 8.

page 38: ""SWR protection"" - SWR is not explained here, though it is
much later in the book.

page 42: ""AMU settings"" - AMU not explained here.

page 46: ""TRF receiver"" - TRF not explained here.

page 50, ""Demodulation"" section: This section describes the circuit
Figure 6.15, but doesn't say it is actually an AM demodulator until
the last paragraph!

page 55, third col, 4th paragraph: ""pick up stray signals'"" - I
think the apostrophe should be a full stop?

page 67, first col, paragraph beginning ""Table 8.1"": Table 8.1 is
on page 65, not 61.

page 67, first col, last paragraph: ""ie"" should be ""i.e.""

page 70, Figure 9.5: The arrow pointing to one of the curves
says ""Power flux density W/m"", but the units should be W/m^2.

page 73: IMP mentioned without explanation.

page 94 and 95: In these pages ""W"" is used instead of the Omega
symbol for resistance. There are also ""kW"" and ""MW"" that should be
Omegas not ""W"".  On the last col of page 94, last paragraph, there
is a Yen symbol where there should be an infinity symbol.

page 108, last col, second last paragraph: ""hcapter"" should be ""chapter""?

page 111, second col, callsigns section: ""(a letter-letter-letter""
should be ""(a) letter-letter-letter""?

page 111, last col, first paragraph: The text says that in practice
call signs for Fiji begin ""3D2"", but earlier says that they call
signs for Fiji begin 3DN-3DZ, however 2 (two) is not between N and
Z.

page 114, middle col, second full paragraph: Text says ""prefix ...
appended"". Usually prefixes are prepended and suffixes are appended,
so I couldn't tell where the extra letters should go.

page 114, last col, last paragraph: ""iinformation"" -> ""information"".

page 120, first col, paragraph beginning ""However"": ""inflect"" should
be ""inflict""?

page 125, middle col, last paragraph: ""Fig 11"" should be ""Fig 12.1""
(repeated twice).

page 127, middle col, last paragraph: ""in other words"" - I think a
new sentence begins here, so it should be "". In other words"".

page 131, Q-codes inside back cover: ""ND mothing doing"" - should be
""ND nothing doing""?

general: In some sections a decimal point is formatted as a dot
level with the bottom or the numbers, and in others it is written
as a dot level with the center of the numbers (e.g. band plan in
back cover uses lower dots, page 86 used centered dots for numbers
and lower dots for figures, figures on page 73-74 use a mix). I
found myself mistaking the centered dots for multiplication in some
places, as it looked like a dot product to me."

"event","I bought a new coat at the weekend. This morning, when I went out in it, Sharon pointed out that it still had the security tag attached. Several people warned me that it might contain ink, and it might be dangerous to remove. By sheer fluke, on the way to the station, I discovered an identical tag at the roadside, that someone had forcibly removed from something.

I took the sample tag apart on the train with <A HREF=""http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwmalone/tag1.jpg"">the following results</A>. There was a body that was about 5cm by 2cm, which seemed to contain some bits of plastic, which I guess were RFID tags of some sort. The round knobbly bit at the end had a piece of metal that held a small pin in place by gripping onto groves on the pin.

The standard way to open them must involve pushing a curved probe around so that pushes on the metal so the pin comes loose. There was even a trap, so if you used a probe with the wrong curvature it would go in the wrong direction.

It seemed like opening it without the right tool would be tricky, put the pin had a pretty narrow head, so I figured that snapping the head off the pin would probably be best. A bit of pushing and pulling with the plyers and screwdriver from my penknife, and the jacket was free! Seems like a <A HREF=""http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwmalone/tag2.jpg"">relatively neat removal job</A>."

The tables on the CAO site show different granularities (some in 100s, some in 50s, some every 10 points), so I've split things into 5 point buckets and assumed the students are uniformly spread over the ranges given, which probably isn't true.

Looks like there is some interesting things going on at the low end and high end that indicate that a larger fraction of students are being given higher points. Mind you, other people have reported this before."

As usual, the x-axis is time (the image covers 10s), the y-axis is frequency (from 0Hz to about 450kHz) and it's coloured by energy. The lightening is the really obvious vertical band. The bright horizontal band is RTE Radio 1 on Longwave on 252kHz.

The lightening has some structure - there's a narrow blast, then a gap of about 50ms then a big ""fizz"" that lasts 300ms. The first 100ms of the fizz seems brighter. Even more interesting is what's happening around 60kHz on either side of the lightening. The spectrum is really fuzzy until the first blast and suddenly you can see the Rugby time signal underneath. You can see some changes at other frequencies too, but they are not as obvious."

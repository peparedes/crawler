How to Know You're In Love:

LOVE...

These are the top 10 signs that you're in love.

10. Time is an eternity when you're without them.

9. Time stops when you're with them.

8. The thought of them makes you shiver.

7. The sound of them makes you smile.

6. When seeing them, you can't see anything else.

5. You start to listen to sappy love songs.

4. You actually enjoy sappy love songs.

3. The smell of them makes you see fireworks.

2. You find yourself smiling constantly.

1. You'd do anything, even die, for them.

I AM IN LOVE WITH NEAL OILAR

KISSES ALL AROUND
MUCH LOVE, ALI"

I HAVE NO IDEA WHY, BUT KYLER INVITED ME TO BE HIS FRIEND ON MYSPACE. WEIRD. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE KNEW THAT I HAD A MYSPACE. ITS FREAKIN ME OUT. AFTER THE MOVIE WE WENT TO MCDONALD'S. I HAD A ICE CREAM CONE. IT WAS GOOD. KYLE KEPT ASKIN FOR A LICK + I ALWAYS GAVE HIM ONE. HE WAS LICKIN IT IN A VERY PROVACATIVE WAY IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF. IT WAS HOTT. JPJP. WELL NOT REALLY. I LIED. I HAD NEVER SEEN KYLE'S NIPPLE RINGS. YA THATS HOTT TO. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I THINK IT IS BUT I DO THINK THATS HOTT. WOW. I WOULD LIKE NEVER DATE HIM BUT DAMN! IT'S THE WAY HE PLAYS WITH IT I THINK. IDK. ITS JUST ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIES OF LIFE. LIKE, HAVE YOU EVER JUST RANDOMLY HATED SOMEONE? I HAVE. I JUST RANDOMLY LIKE THAT DARN LIP RING! GAH ROAR! MY BRAIN IS A COMPLICATED THING. I THINK THAT ANYONE OF OUR GUY FRIENDS WOULD SELF DESTRUCT IF THEY SAW WHAT GOES ON IN MY HEAD. WOULDNT THAT BE CRAZY IF WE COULD READ EACHOTHERS MINDS? </STRONG></FONT></P>

K TO THE EXCITIN PART. SO, OVERALLS WAS THERE. YA. HEHEHE. I GO TO SAY HI TO MY AHS FRIENDS AND I BROUGHT THEM BACK WITH ME TO THE MACK SIDE. THEY LOVED IT. THEY REALLY LIKED YOU GUYS. I THINK SAVANNAH SHOULD GO TO MACK THAT WOULD BE WAY COOL YA. SO WHEN WE WERE WALKIN BACK I SAW THAT OVERALLS WAS SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE I WAS SITTIN (NEXT TO ALYSSA) SO I SAT DOWN IN BETWEEN THEM EQUAL DISTANCE APART. THEN (GOD BLESS BLONDIE!!!!!) BLONDIE COMES UP AND TELLS ME TO SCOOT OVER SHE WAS SITTIN NEXT TO ALYSSA. I DONT COMPLAIN AND JUST SCOOT CLOSE TO OVERALLS. SMILES. SO THE GAMES GOIN ON AND WERE TALKIN. (THESE EVENTS ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER) I LOOK AT HIM AND HE TELLS ME TO LOOK UP, SO I DO. AND ASK HIM WHAT IM LOOKIN FOR. THEN HE GENTLY GRABS MY SHOULDERS AND TURNS ME AROUND SO IM FACIN ALYSSA (I WAS FACING HIM AND LOOKING UP + BLONDIE LEFT FOR A MOMENT) LEANS ME BACK AGAINST HIM AND PUTS HIS HEAD RIGHT NEXT TO MINE AND POINTS. CAN YOU GUESS WHAT HE WAS POINTING AT? THE MOON. I WAS MELTING INSIDE. YA. WOW. SO THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE HALF HE WAS SITTIN NEXT TO ME. SMILES. HE ALSO TRIED (AND SUCCEEDED) TO TICKLE ME ON MY KNEES. GOD IM TICKLISH THERE. I JUST HAPPENED TO WIGGLE OUT OF THE TICKLE CLOSER TO HIM TO. K THIS IS THE BEST PART OF LAST NIGHT: (IT WAS RAINING BUT IT STOPPED BEFORE THIS. AND IT WAS REALLY COLD) K I WAS TALKIN TO OVERALLS AND THEN JUST OUTTA THE BLUE HE ASKED ME IF I WAS COLD. I SAID A LITTLE BIT. THEN HE OFFERED ME HIS JACKET!

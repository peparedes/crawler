Its because I have been busy here lately, and I muat say I have a brand new obession!
So yes, my Ace obession is coming to a close. Now your probally thinking ""who in the world is this maniac crazy over now?"". Haha I was wondering that too, until we went to the Emerson Drive concert exactly a week ago. I must tell yall that Brad Mates (lead singer) is the best thang to walk the Earth . he has awesome vocals and is so entertaing. The other band memebers ( i dont know all their names but im working on it)are truley amazing too! I am going to put up some pictures i took at the concert , but sadly i didnt get one of Brad waving at me. So yes he did see me I was right at the stage. I wanted to grab him lol. He also smiled at me a lot(it sorta made my dad mad lol). Anywho here are the pictures and a banner thingy i made too!

"event","Ok I have this guy friend lets say his name is ....Tim.Anyways we have been friends for
4 years and every year except for this year Tim has asked me out . I have said no a lot of times
except for when we went to the movies with a lot of our other friends together.
Now as i said above he hasnt asked me out any this year and hes acting nicer 
then ever to me. I actually think i like him as more then a friend now. One problem 
he has a girlfriend that dislikes me A LOT, and hes always around her and everything.
I havent told any of my friends about this because he likes to bug them and thinks they are
annoying and they think hes ugly and mean, but they know hes my friend and  they all 
respect that . Also today soemthing happened and it actually looked like we were holding hands.
So now my friends were teasing me and saying funny things and everything and one of  Tim's friends
said ""your girlfriends gonna love this."" Now I am afraid she might find out and dislike me more.
I keep trying to tell myself that I dont like him and I need to get over him because i just 
probaly want attention and miss him being my best friend and head over hills for me.

so any advice at all on anything?"

                   8.10.06 the best day evah

ok so my parents check me out at 12:00 to go to Nashville
to hopefully meet Ace and to go to the concert.After two hours of traveilng 
and getting lost once we get there.We walked around the building once then a woman stopped us 
and said we missed Ace and Chris were here 5 minutes ago in that spot i was standing.When she told me that
i didnt know if i wanted to cry or be mad lol.So we walked around about 30 more minutes and went and got something to eat
at macdonalds.There were alot of police there ...wierd, but everytime a fat police passed my brother he said ""oink"" behind them
it was hilariuos!Anyways we go back and never get to meet Ace so we just hang out there till 6:00 when the line started getting longer.
The news channel came and taped me it was funny we were all scrunched in and they told me to smile so i did that was awesome.
So we finally get in and get seated then the concert starts.


Mandisa comes out first and sings I cant tell you what she sung i was in Ace lala land.
Finally Ace came out and sung with Mandisa It was Excellent i loved it ace and her have amazing voices that
sounded great together!

Now Ace time!I didnt shutup i was screaming my heart out during the whole thing.
At the begining ace did this awesome chest throb thing i was drooling lol.After that he took his
jacket off and i was spazzing and sweating and yeah so my dad gives me a wierd look when i screamed ""i want ace now!"". Then he 
had the whole place standing up!After father figure Ace stands there for a second 
and then says ""you people are amazing its raining like crazy"" He was just laughing and laughing.
Then Harder to Breathe started and well the song title explains me i thought i was gonna cry or passout i loved it
he jumped off the rampy thingy and i was like""oh no dont do that again!"".Well he doesnt jump agian but he puts he feet on the
rails and stands i was like""ur gonna give me a heart attack"" but all i did was keep screaming and waving my beanie.

umm skipping the other peeps and going to paitence.

Patience was awesome im the biggest Axl Rose fan and at first i had doubts but
i thought ace did the best out of the group it was amazing!

Now We Are The Champions
On this song chris started it out then ace came out singing in falsetto!
I was standing up jumping waving my beanie around because we didnt have floor seats
so i didnt think ace could see me but we were first row from the floor.
Then Ace points over to my section and dumb me i turn around
and look for who he is pointing at but then i relize that im the only ace fan in my section LOL.
So then ace does a small wave at my section again and i dont wave cause im singing along with taylor i think
was singing at the time.So I start waving my beanie again in the hair.Then Ace starts doing a big wave in like the same way i 
was waving my beanie.Well that got my attention i figured out it was me he was waving at me so i finally wave.
Ace laughs and goes and does another smaller jump in a way idk i cant really figure out what it was LOL.After that was the other group song which 
i loved ace was really spazzy which was cool he was soo different. 
  
ill try to post the pics later but the r sorta black i couldnt stay still!
same for video but i zoomed out instead of in on it lol!"

4-3[-2(7-10)/(-3)+(-8)] /10(-4) and 6-[8-4(6-9)+(-12)/3]+(8-12)(5)

"event","I think yesterday day was the worst day of my life first my mom's friend came over who lives on base.I WAS OK WITH THAT.Well my mom's friend ,Rachel brought a guy from the military named G here with her and i didnt know him AT ALL. So anyways I am a VERY independent girl so I did not come out and swim wiht G, rachel, and my mom. So G decides he thinks there is something wrong with me because i was sitting in my room watching tv. G comes into my room and starts talking to me like hes my d*mn shrink or something ughh. So I cock an attitude and just stare at my ace pic instead of him. Then he said 
""your mom told me you want to move to new york"" and messed with my toes and pulled my big toe and said ""this is the big city ""and pulled my little toe and added""this is your town"" then said ""the city will make you or brake you""
I jerked my foot away because i dont even know this wierdo and kept staring at my Ace pic.Then my mom comes in and says ""hey guys"" then G says""im trying to talk your daughter into getting out sometimes i only need 5 minutes alone with her"" then i thought i was gonna see smoke come out of my mom's ears LOL.My mom said ""umm ill stay in here"".So right in front of my mom G asks so what do you think of me physically ?"" and then i was thinking ur ugly, and 24 im 13 you freak ! But instead i said ""ur short"" and just ignored him. SO about five minutes later he blabs on and on about whatever i wasnt listening my mom was talking for me i guess then  G leaves. After that my mom was sitting in my room with me then i noticed my phone was gone! Then believe it or not that sh!thead had my phone and called my friend kristina and freaked her out.Now my dad just got home from the store (funny how it all happened when he was gone)and got my cellphone back and lets just say that dude left me alone and didnt talk to me since he left this morning and it was just a simple bye.YAY GOOD RIDINSCE(sp)

on the brighter side i joined a blending contest on IDF so it should be fun!"

If you don't have musical talent, you've got a talent for picking out great CD's.
Music rules your life - and you've got the best MP3 collection of anyone you know.
Many guys find you intimidating, but a select few think you're the catch of a lifetime.
Start hanging out in more used record stores, and you'll find love with a fellow rocker!</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://ynr.blogthings.com/whatkindofgirlareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Girl Are You?</a></div>

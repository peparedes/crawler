We played darts. We laughed. We had fun. A thousand tiny needles turned my heart to shreds.

Damn."

"event","So I'm flipping through the news bits at <a href=""http://www.slashdot.org"">Slashdot</a> as I do when I'm bored at work and I found the following article.

Without a degree and working a job that I'm great at, but have few prior qualifications for. I am scared.

"event","When I first set this thing up it was to be a place where I could update my many friends on my day to day life. I'd link to pictures I've taken and tell tales of my wonderful life in downtown Toronto.

That has changed.

I've always had a dark, cynical, some might call 'realist' side. Usually it involved women. I always wanted a girlfriend. But being depressed about being alone doesn't get a date. So I learned to hide it. Lock it away behind a wall in my soul.

I can't always control it. The days I awake with that deep, chest pressing depression, I call 'Battling The Grey'. So far, alcohol has been my only (legal) defense.

What will follow will be part history, part current events. I don't think anyone will read it. I don't care. Probably better that way. This will be some sort of self induced therapy. I am not the excited, loud, entertaining guy everyone knows. Just a sad clown.

That, and I'm a damn proud Canadian, eh?"

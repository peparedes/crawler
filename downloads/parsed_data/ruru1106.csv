"event","what a day.  I feel like I get more bipolar the longer I stay in college.  I've finally come to the conclusion that depression is the default condition of life.  well, maybe depression is a little strong - i dont mean like suicidal, my life is horrible depression, but just the monotonous, nothing good is happening, what am i doing in life depression.  Sure there are moments of happiness, whole streches of it in fact but sooner or later you're back where you started: bored, pissed off, insecure, wanting to curl up and go to sleep for the next couple of days.  It's just something you have to deal with.  Life is gonna suck, but it sucks for everyone, you have a few highs and a lot of lows (some lower than others).  But as long as you live for the highs, it's almost bearable.

well thats my phylosophical thought of the day.  I've been busy the past 2 days with a lot of crap.  It seems like all of my professors decided to give a last minute assignment at the same time.  I dont even care anymore about any of my classes.  its like I'm just going through the motions to get the degree without even thinking about if thats what i want or not.  I talked to a grad student today - he was in the Bioinformatics lab in Russ and i just randomly asked him what he was studying.  basically what i got out of the conversation is that it really doesnt matter what the hell i do at this point in time.  I could major in CS and then end up working as a forest ranger if i wanted to, or i could major in ecology and end up programming weapons of mass destruction for the US government.  i guess it made me feel better to know that the rest of the world really doesnt care if you can wire a counter circuit or not.  he was really nice and told me to stop by anytime i had any more questions.  I wish i had asked him his name...

lets see what else is new.  sophomore year is a huge difference from freshman year, it kinda started last spring quarter but i think now especially I'm starting to figure out that college is boring, and long, and it sucks, and that this is all gonna continue on for the rest of your life.  you become distanced with some friends and closer to others, and shit changes and the only thing u can really do is do whats best for you.

wow that was a depressing entry, it needs something cheery: ""this is the song that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friends, some people started singing it not knowing what it was, and they'll continue singing it forever just because this is the song that never ends..."""

1. go to the CAC (preferably in the early evening when there's less people but the really devoted ones are still there practicing)
2. find the red elevator in the music wing
3. push the top floor button
4. relax and enjoy the different sounds of music that you hear all around you as you go up in the elevator - jazz band, choir, flute solos, and a million other different sounds"

"event","hi. i bet you thought you'd never see me writing here again.

anyway, school started this week. it's been great getting back into the swing of things. in some ways it feels like I never left. People i haven't seen in 3 or 6 months i just went right back into the swing of things with. but of course there are differences. a whole bunch of new freshmen - Craig, Megan, Kyle - who i hope will integrate into the group relatively well.  a lot of the fears i had about retuning back to campus haven't been realized.  But i'm sure i have some nasty surprises waiting for me in the future that i wouldn't have thought of. classes have been good. bio is boring but easy. CEG 260 is boring but not so easy - i only have 6 people in my entire class. chemistry i think i'm really going to like - the proffesor is pretty cool and seems to know what he's talking about. I hope my math class doesn't move too fast like it did the first day but either way i think i'm going to enjoy it because my prof is hilarious.  he speaks with a really odd accent - always rolling his r's.  but the highlight of my academic schedule is UNIX with Dr. Doom - yes that's really his name.  dr. doom seems like the coolest prof to have and he is really smart about what he teaches and how he teaches it.  and he is pretty good looking - long dark hair and great eyes.  well thats about all i feel like covering today - until we meet again."

"event","sigh, another day another entry.  I have been on this little crafting hike lately - i made a pendant out of wire and am working on a pair of earings from beads.  Other than that life has been pretty boring.  Watch some movies, go swimming, life goes on... I went out with some people yesterday to Legacy Village and then we watched movies over my house.  Without getting into too many sordid details lets just say that last night made me realize that I really dont need a relationship right now - nor do i really want one.  I mean dont get wrong, I would love to be swept off my feet by the love of my life, but too have a guy just for the sake of having a guy... no thank you.  I'm tired of kissing frogs in hopes of finding a prince - I'd rather just wait for a real prince to come along.  anyway, speaking of creepy romances - anyone ever seen the movie ""The Secretary""?  Nothing like a love story with some S&M and bondage involved.  Creepy is not the word for this movie - jaw-dropping is more like it.  Well thats enough rambling from me.  as Jeremy would say - tata..."

Anyway I think one of the highlights of the weekend was the barbecue with me, my mom, and PJ.  my mom had been in a crappy mood all day and when we got there all she did was complain - the sun was too bright, the coals werent hot enough, the chicken was cooking too slowly, i got sick of listening to her so i took a walk.  by the time i got back my mom had drunk 2 16 oz bottles of wine and a few shots of vodka - she was GONE.  my mom loved everything - the chicken was amazing, the weather was great, the potato salad was delicious.  She had made this special sauce to go along with the chicken and she just couldnt shut up about it the whole time - ""mmmmmm, this is so good"" ""ohh, i need some more sauce"" ""PJ try this sauce"" ""julia put some more sauce on ur chicken"" ""dont u just love this sauce"" ""i need to make some more sauce""...  me and pj couldnt stop laughing the whole time..."

"event","my wheelchair is broken - badly broken.  The right-hand motor is stopping and so i end up going in circles because my left motor is still going.  And every once in a while my chair just gives out all together and won't start again.  once it gets started it goes for a while (albeit not straight).  its like an old car that you have to push to get it started but then it can go until it stops.  Anyway, because i already ordered my new chair, my insurance wont pay for a new motor for the old chair.  So i'm stuck.  Thankfully, Mark has a spare chair that i can use until i figure something else out.  Oh, and i'm sick on top of all that - my nose is really stuffy and i can't breathe at night.

I forgot the place closes at 10 on weekdays so we all had to leave and were in the parking lot trying to figure out what to do when we see this one russian kid from the high school in a car making out with two ckicks.  So ilya yak decides to have some fun with this - since the guy in the car is apparently a huge a**hole.  He gets out a bunch of lawn chairs from his car and we sit on them in the middle of the parking lot watching the people making out.  When they finally noticed us watching them (which took a while), they started cracking up, one girl was sitting in the passanger seat and not doing anything but the other girl was stradling the guy in the drivers seat and she would not get off of him.  So there's like 5 of us just chilling in the parking lot watching them make out.  My friends Victor and Kelly went over there and knocked on the window, the guy opens the door and we see that the girl stradling him is wearing pajama bottoms which are around her ankles and some short booty shorts underneath that are like halfway up her butt so you can see her whole buttcheek hanging out.  So Victor is trying to talk to the guy and the chick is just going crazy throwing herself on top of him and kissing his face and his neck while he's trying to talk to Victor.  Eventually victor and kelly leave and the guy closes the door - come to find out that the two girls were sisters and the younger one (in the passenger seat) was like 13.  Just then the girl stradling the guy starts taking her top off and a while later the passenger girl screams and runs out of the car to an SUV parked across the parking lot but she cant get in because her sister has the keys.  So the sister puts her top and pants back on and walks out of the car and gets in the SUV and the two girls drive off.  The guy opens his window and yells out at us ""I'm here every night at 9"" and leaves."

"event","you know i made it a point to update lj more often in the summer and so far that hasnt been happening.  Anyway, this past week i actually had an excuse - I went to MDA camp.  Not as fun as it had been years past but nice nevertheless.  The second night there a bunch of guys got into a HUGE debate about religion that lasted for about 3 hours.  I got bored listening so I left to go to the campfire about halfway through but from what I understand one guy avtually called up his wife on the phone to get her to talk to this other guy and try to convert him - this went on forever, everytime someone would say they were sick of fighting someone else would say something and they would start fighting again - the funny thing is it was all the guys that were arguing and all the girls were just watching them thinking they were out of their minds. 

But anyway, I think the reason camp wasnt as much fun was because a lot of the people from previous years werent there.  Rose came to visit one night - God I swear I love that girl, she's one of the few girls in my cabin that isnt all caddy and cliquey and can just chill with everyone.  Honestly thats one thing that always pissed me off about camp - how all the other cabins could just relax and have fun and our cabin just had one drama after another.  It was like a real life version of the movie ""Mean Girls"".  Some years I really doubted coming back to camp but even with all the caddyness I still would go back every year - I dont know, there's just an understanding at camp that you dont find other places - and its not just the disability thing because lots of people are cool with that, its hard to explain.  I didnt think I would cry this year at the closing campfire but I did.  

I think its funny how people can change - this one guy whos a counselor at the camp - his name is Gilly.  Gilly first started there when he was 16 years old and he was a bad ass kid.  The guy was irresponsible, would lose track of his camper, sleep all day, stay out partying all night, got caught making out in the bushes quite a few times... But he kept coming back anf he kept coming back and one year he just changed - he grew up, he became a unit leader, stopped trying to break all the rules.  I swear Gilly is one of the most caring people I ever met at MDA camp, he would do anything for those kids.

The other sad piece about camp was that it was Louie's last year there since he was 21.  Ah, Louie, Louie, Louie, I dont know what to say about him.  I first met him at the JCC performing arts camp (despite the fact that he's catholic), and later I found out that he went to MDA camp.  However my mom and his dad actually knew each other peforehand and almost went out.  Louie is a devil - I had a bet with him one year that he couldnt go 5 minutes without saying ""fuck"" - and I won.  He drinks all the time, he used to do drugs, he cant shut up for more that 2 minutes, has an opinion on everything, and used to call me ""foxy"".  Anyway, its sucked to watch him deteriorate physically through the years, and especially this year when I saw pictures of him as a little kid and he was still in a manual chair.  I remember seeing him on a respirator one year and I couldn't stop crying.  I mean its always sad to see campers get worse and worse, but I know Louie a lot better than I knew the other kids so it's different...

well anyway thats enough about camp.  I saw some good movies past couple of days:

La Strada - some old Italian black and white movie, very funny and cute, different from some older american movies that look all fake, cute story too.

Clockwork Orange - ok, this is a movie i've been wanting to see for a while now and i dont know if it was because I had heard so much about it before hand but when i finally saw it i was pretty dissapointed.  i mean its a good movie, very well shot and directed, and some awesome music in the background, but its just not what i was expecting.  I knew it was gonna be different from the book and without the ""happy"" ending.  i guess i just didnt expect it to be as... well... funny as it was.  like theres one part in the book where he drugs and rapes 2 ten-year-old girls - which i thought was one of the most disturbing parts of the book - and in the movie its consensual sex between adults, no drugs involved, and played in fast motion with the ""william tell overture"" in the background.  i guess because i read the book first and liked it so much i cant see the story in any other light.  it would be interesting to see what people who saw the movie without reading the book thought of it.

Closer - yes, Mike Mueller would be proud of me, i finally saw the movie closer.  wow, awesome movie, really stays in your mind and makes you think about it for days afterward.  the main song in the movie that goes ""can't take my eyes off of you..."" is just amazing and it was in my head for a long time afterward.  And my god, Julia Roberts was a BITCH.  i mean wow we've come a long way from ""Steel Magnolias"" and ""Pretty Woman"" the one scene with her and cleve owen in the restaurant just made me want to bitch slap her so bad.  as a matter of fact, every scene with her in it made me want to bitch slap her.  I mean, okay, Clive owen is just a nympho and a freak, natalie portman is pretty much faithful to jude, jude law, okay the guy made some rotten moves but you could kinda see where he was coming from, but Julia - my god, that woman just used and abused every guy there, its like she WANTED to ruin every decent thing that happened to her.  and why the fuck didnt clive or jude cheat on her, i mean come on people shes not all that hot, and she's a fucking bitch so get over it and go fuck natalie portman already - the poor girl is the only halfway decent person in the movie but of course clive and jude can't see that because they're too blinded by julia's ""perfect"" teeth.  anyway my favorite line in the movie is when jude law goes to confront clive about his relationship with julia:

jude - she's happy with me
clive - she doesnt want to be happy
jude - what do you mean? everyone wants to be happy.
clive - depressives dont. they want to be miserable so they have a reason for being depressed. if they werent miserable they would have to actually go out and live - which can be depressing.

ooh ooh, and did anyone who saw the movie notice the nail picture/statue thing in the back of clive's office - its of two hands reaching for each other, trying to get closer, but not touching...

the station agent - AAAAAWWWWWWWW, thats all i can say after seeing that movie, funny, heartfelt, wonderful comedy, i kept picturing myself in the role of the cuban hot dog guy joe, and i loved the little girl in the movie - she's the same actress as in the movie ""Lovely and Amazing"" and i really wish she would do more films because she is really good for a little kid."

"event","well the past few days in cleveland have been pretty busy.  I unpacked all my stuff, cleaned out my room, and visited with old friends.  I ended up going to Golden Gate Plaza 3 days in a row (almost 4, but my mom wouldnt let me).  I saw Val again and we went to the dollar store.  That place has a lot of cool asian decorations crap- like lanterns, wall hangings, etc.  and its all really really cheap so i'm seriously thinking about decorating my room all asian themed next year.  One day, I ran into Nikita and his friend Matt at Caribou.  I'm really glad to see him again and to hear that he's doing alright - he hasn't chnged much, but I think he's a little more serious about school and stuff.  His friend Matt was....interesting, he seems like a real arrogant lazy dick - but thats just my opinion.  I also saw Ilya Batikov one day and me, him, and Xing played poker.  I think its pretty funny how I'm more sociable with these people now than I ever was in high school - I think college made a lot of people forget old high school BS and just be cool with one another.  One downfall is that I dont have any transportation, or PAs that will put me to bed later, see my mom's bedtime is 10 pm so thats kinda become my curfew - which sucks.  But my mom is going out of town this weekend so I'm planning on getting people together saturday night.  I'm kinda worried that people will come expecting some big party when thats really not what I'm planning at all - just a small get-together. 

Hmm, what else... My grandma came over one day with her friend who flew in from LA.  The two of them had been best friends since kindergarden when they played hopscotch together.  They went to college together, raised families together, moved to America round the same time and are still close friends today.  They are so completely different though.  My grandma hates going out of her house and her big social event is going to English classes once a week.  Her friend has parties every weekend and has travelled all over the world.  When she visited us she had just gotten a Henna tatoo from an Indian friend of hers and was on her way to Germany and then to the south of France.  

Oh, I'm getting a new chair, I go to the hospital to order it this Friday.

I saw some really weird movies this past weekend.  First I saw ""I Heart Huckabees"" which is basically all about existentialism - ""the mathematics of the universe has no remainder""  But then I saw ""Before Night Falls"" which is a biography of Reinaldo Arenas and talks all about homosexuality in Cuba at the time of the revolution.  Its a really long and depressing movie.

hmm, i feel like there should be more to say but I guess thats about it."

"event","wow, so this is what the update page looks like - i havent been on here for like a month.

anyway, theres so much to write about but i think i'll just skip over most of it and have a big end of the year post.

here's some memories (in no particular order)

1. CS class - rizki is the most awesome prof ever and i loved meeting all my fellow cs and engineering majors

2. chem class with ken - playing hangman instead of listening to the teacher, him breaking my chair after class, deep talks about family and god

3. winter formal - the dress fiasco, elton breaking my chair, mike's party afterwards

4. clubbing - jay, carly, matt, leah, and whoever else, mike crouse getting a lap dance, trying to figure out scott, watching leah and jay grinding

5. the random bravo trip - switching chairs, mike trying to get me in the car, random quotes, listening to wicked on the way back

6. confetti in dave's room - this needs no explanation

7. interesting conversation with leah, squeak, and lauren - no explanation for this either

8. my surpsrise b-day party - awwww, i love my friends (and the cake)

9. late nights talk with jess about families, guys, god, and anything else

10. jeremy's bonfire

11. mike's first party

12. mine and jenny's trips to bob evans first quarter

13. exploring with leah and bike riding with jeremy

14. mine and jenny's late night talks

yeah there's so many more awesome memories that i could put here but i dont feel like going down the list of every little thing i did.  first year has been awesome, i definitely did not expect it to be a s big of a change.  I did a lot of growing and i think the biggest thing i realized is that i'm gonna keep growing all my life - there's no point where you stop changing.  I like the balance I've found between home and school - i actually became a lot closer with my old high school friends after graduation because i got the chance to grow and step out of my shell in college.  by the same token, i became close to people in college because of stuff that i learned in high school.

ok well this entry is gonna be cut short because i got shit to do

until next time...."

"event","good news: i got an A on my english essay so I'm currently getting an A in Chemistry and English.

bad news: I just got my ass kicked by a monstrous CS midterm.  i remember looking up halfway through the class and seeing Squeak and Rob laughing and staring at their papers in disbelief - and if the two of them are clueless you know it had to be bad.  On all other exams I had for Rizki people were done within the first half hour but this time I heard there were people in the room until like an hour after the class was over.  Its times like these I contemplate switching my major.

speaking of majors, I scheduled yesterday and realized just how far along I am on a Biology major, I basically have all the math, physics, gen eds, and most of the chem done already.  So I'm seriously thinking about majoring in Bio and just minoring in CS.  oh well, i suppose I'll just figure it out next year.

ok, i was looking on snopes.com one day and i found this artist named Charlie White.  He has a lot of stuff about LA culture and its hypocrisy and evil but this one collection is called ""Understanding Joshua"" and its about ""male inadequacy in modern culture.""  personally i find some of his pieces are really creepy and disturbing - its like a teenage boy's wet dream gone horribly wrong.  But nevertheless it does make you think.  Anyway, here's the site with links to some of the pics - warning: these pictures contain mature content and may not be suitable for a younger audience.

second of all: some things were brought to my attention today which, although i always knew were somewhat true, i never really thought about before.  its really good to see urself from another's pov sometimes: the stuff you thought was such a big deal suddenly becomes clear and easy to solve.  i guess what it comes down to is that i'm through trying to be someone i'm not.  you meet so many different people in college you feel like you have to get to know everyone and it just ends up blowing up in your face and making you look like the hypocrite you really are.  I know this seems a little mean and like I'm bitter about something but I'm actually somewhat happier now than I have been - maybe i was a little bitter initially but its all for the best in the long run.  As a matter of fact, enough journal space has been devoted to this in this entry already - i'm done.

third of all: i changed my layout (again), i think its gonna actually stay this way for longer than one week - progress for me!

"event","last night i had a really messed up dream - it was like a bad thriller movie and musical all mixed up in one.  I'm laughing just thinking about.  Ok, here goes.  The whole dream starts when the barometric pressure of the earth starts rising higher and higher.  And throughout the whole dream they keep showing this giant test-tube shaped barometer with water going up higher and higher and swirling a little mini tornado.  And there's this guy and girl that are in Honors and the girl goes outside although she's not supposed to.  And i dont know if she gets kidnapped or just seduced or what but she ends up going with this evil blonde lady to her secret headquarters.  Then there's this whole group of people (me included) that go to find her and we go through this city in the middle of the night.  and the whole time we're walking its like really cool, almost movie-like, effects - like showing us from above looking through a window, standing under the streetlights, its all very artsy.  O, and my mom and PJ are there and they think we're all idiots.  Well, anyway, we end up getting to this huge warehouse where the evil blonde lady's headquarters are and (now this is where it makes no sense) we get up on top of a stage and begin playing guitars and singing ""Our Lips are Sealed"" and jumping around the stage like crazy.  Well, for some reason, this helps us defeat the evil blonde lady and the girl that got kidnapped comes out and we all set to walk back through the city back home.  Oh, and for some reason natalie portman is there too.  Anyway, while we're walking back, its all in slow motion, very heroic-like, and we cross this street single file - like the beatles on the album cover - and Patrick Schnarrenberger (a kid from high school) runs up behind us and starts walking all slow motion and heroically as well.  And then they show the barometer thing for the last time and all the water drains lower and lower and lower and a newspaper headline pops up saying that the whole world has been saved and order is restored.  And then I wake up."

"event","my life is so extremely boring this quarter.  I look over my ljs and most of them are like ""i saw something cool online today"" or ""i read a cool book"" - damn it, i gotta get out more.  Right now Leah, Lauren, Amy, and i dunno who else are shopping, Jeremy and Dave went to Chuckie Cheese, Jess is doing Relay for Life with a whole bunch of people.  and I'm sitting here in the computer lab alone on a friday night.  I gotta get a life, this is way too much like high school and i do not wanna go back there again.  I know that I'm just in a bad mood this whole week, but it still sucks.  As soon as I wrote that I want to take it back - I just hung out with Jay and Leah a few days ago, and its not like it's like this all the time.  I really dont mean it when i say that i'm all alone and everyone's left me - i know its not like that.  I have great friends here and at home and I just gotta snap out of it and enjoy life for what its worth.  Its so ironic that I always thought of myself as an optimist but I seem to be looking at the bad sides of a situation.  jenny just imed me, i feel better now.

well that was a very bipolar entry right there.

anyway, dave told me to write something philosophical so here goes: is it better to choose the bad or to have the good imposed upon you?  I'm pretty sure that this is a quote from ""a clockwork orange"" or a critique of it.  the book was writen in response to Soviet Russia and how its propaganda was basically brainwashing the people and imposing its ideals in them - I think especially of little kids who had all that propaganda in the schools.  And the ideals were pretty noble and good but the point is that imposition of any kind of belief is wrong.  I remember my mom telling me when the Beatles first came to Russia and how it was an awakening for all the teenagers there that here was a different way of living and a different way of thinking that hadn't been known before.  VH1 said one time that the Beatles helped to end communism and I believe it.  

anyway back to the quote: is it better to choose to be evil and to have people respect you and fear you or is it better to be a brainwashed pawn in the hands of someone else.  Most people would say that it is best to choose the GOOD which it is.  But when you think about it, how many things do you choose and how many things are just imposed upon you.  Do you choose to get good grades or do people tell you that thats what you should do?  Do you REALLY want to be in college or did your guidance couselor tell you that thats the only way you could make decent money?  Do you smoke marijuana? why not?  because its bad for your health and thats why its illegal?  Did you know that the US government made marijuana illegal in the 1930s as a political move to get rid off mexican migrant workers and that scientists were called in and said that marijuana is not dangerous at all?  Now, I'm just playing devils advocate here - I'm not saying that anyone should drop out off college and become a pot head.  I'm just saying there's different sides to every story.

I read in a book the other day a story about a 14 year old boy in the early years of the USSR that denounced his father to the secret police for conspiring against the soviet government.  the father went to a concentration camp in siberia and later died there.  Some of his fathers friends went and killed the boy.  He remained a martyr for communism and every year soviet children would lay flowers at his monument in the city.  its really sad to hear about a kid being so brainwashed by political ideology that he would turn in his own father and even sadder to hear that grown men - who could have known better - decided to kill a kid for their own political gain."

"event","""restless"" - what an awesome mood, what an awesome word.  Think about all the connotations.  You can be so happy with something that happened that you're bursting at the seams with energy and you cant be bothered with the monotony of the rest of your life.  You can be so upset that you cant rest because of all the negative thoughts in your head.  You can just be pissed off that you have no great happiness or no great sadness and you want it all - good or bad - you just want it and you can't wait for it for another boring monotonous day.  Restless is the emotion of utter boredom, and of supreme ecstasy.  Restless lets you know you're alive and that you do have something to want and to hope for and to not rest until you have it.  Restless is when you see the rest of the world is in a daze and you want to scream at the top of your lungs to snap them out of it.

Restless is what happens when you wake up and realize you dont want to go to sleep again."

"event","wow, what a boring couple of days these have been: the weather sucks, everyone either went home or entertained their little siblings all weekend.  Friday the weather got pretty bad and it started storming - with wind and lightning and all that.  I was on the elevator with Squeak and Jenny, and Squeak says something like ""wouldn't it be funny if we got stuck on this elevator"" and starts jumping up and down - just then, the elevator stops and goes pitch black.  The little emergency light kicks on in a little bit but its still really dark.  We're all freaking out and pressing the alarm button and are about to call campus police when the power starts again and the doors open and we go out onto the 5th floor.  Apparently the power went out all over campus, there were even police and fire trucks over in the Woods.

other than that - i have done next to nothing all weekend.  I wrote my english essay - which could have taken me only a couple hours but I had to drag it out into a couple days.  And I talked on aim nonstop - i now have permanent carpal tunnel in my right hand - but oh well.

I am falling asleep as I write this - i really do not want to go to chemistry today, argh, i dont want to have to get up.  why oh why did i schedule an 8:30 class."

"event","wow, NOW i'm getting scared.  Right after i posted that previous entry i hit random again saying ""how weird would it be if I hit a russian person"" - and it was Russian.  I'm like cowering in fear right now because theres some sort of lj conspiracy out there to get me - its like they read my last lj, and they knew what I was thinking when I hit random just now.  I think I will go hide in a corner somewhere and stay away from the random button for a while."

"event","ok, so i'm basically obsessed with looking up random ljs now.  which is fine, but i just have one question.  Is lj just extremely popular in Russia or am i just lucky enough to have looked up every single Russian person with lj.  Its really pretty freaky - one time I had three random ljs in a row all from Russian people.  The other day I went on random lj and I said to myself ""there's no way the first lj that comes up will be russian"" - and it was.  and just now i hit two russian ljs in like 5 minutes so i said to myself ""if this next lj is russian, I'm writing an entry about this"" - and it was, so here i am, writing an entry about the irony that is lj.  I mean, is it some sort of conspiracy or something? did they look through my entries and realize how many times I mentioned Russia and decided to make all my random ljs come up from Russian ppl.  Or maybe theres just an exorbiant amount of Russians on lj.  It just seems strange because I hardly ever see german, or british, or any other nationality on my random searches - just Russian."

"event","yey - cs project is finished, am quite proud of myself actually for not bs-ing around on it like i usually do.  went to quaker steak and lube for carly's b-day yesterday.  it was pretty fun, despite me not knowing many people there.  I knew Jay, EJ, Matt, Carly (obviously), and Jesse.  I think that was it out of like a huge table of 20+ ppl.  They ate a ton of wings and Carly tried the atomic ones and got all red and teary.  

Let's see, what else.  I have an essay to read for art history (due today), another story to read for english (due today).  and i have to do some online crap for chemistry and a lab report due tomorrow.  Not to mention the CS lab due friday and 2 english essays due monday.  And I havent even found out the extent of all the tests I have to take.  I know I have an english test next wednesday, I think i have an art history test sometime then too, and I bet there's a CS test coming up as well.  Oh, speaking of tests, I got a 78% on a chem test that I thought I got a 100% on.  So now I gotta actually try to study for the next one.

hmm, i feel like writing somethng philosophical - how about: no true idealist ever accopmlishes what he sets out to do because human nature will ultimately water down his vision.

"event","the past few days have been sunny and beautiful.  Sunday I was wandering around outside and I ended up going from the CAC to the Nutter Center.  Then when I got there I decided that it would be a smart idea for me to go all the way to lot 20 from there.  It wasnt that wheelchair accessible so I spent most of the time either dodging cars or going across the grass.  When I got to lot 20 I went on the bike path back to campus but then I saw a trail going off into the woods so I went exploring again.  I almost got lost wandering around all the little pathways and turns in the woods and finally came out outside of millett.  

Then later that night me and Leah decided to go exploring so we went into the woods again and then later came out on the bike path on Kauffman Ave.  Kim had told me earlier that the bike path led to the Wright Brothers Memorial so we decided to go check it out but we went the wrong way!  We ended up going underneath I-675 and following the train tracks until we ended up in the next town over, behind the air force base, where there's a bunch of ghetto looking houses.  Later that evening we watched ""Dirty Dancing"" with Jenny and Alana since neither of them had seen it before and we went biking with Jeremy.

Yesterday me, Leah, and Jeremy continued on our quest to find the Wright Brothers Memorial.  We biked the opposite way down Kauffman but halfway there Jeremy turned around and went back but me and Leah continued.  We finally made it up the hill to the Memorial and it was absolutely gorgeous.  You could see everything from up there - the runways, the highway, the woods, everything.  The sun was setting over the horizon, and it was all warm and calm - absolutely perfect.  We could only stay for a few minutes since the park was closing and we wanted to get back before dark anyway.

Today I've basically been working on this CS project - its actually not that bad once you get started on it - I think I just freaked out because of all the display stuff that I hadnt done before - but the actual coding isnt that bad.  I'm taking a break now from it.

Oh, in other news, Liz called my mom a few weeks ago and I got her number.  So I talked to her a little last night - she's doing better now she says so hopefully we can stay in touch.

ok, well its getting a little chilly in this CS lab so i'm gonna go take a walk outside before I get back to work on this project."

"event","well, my mom came to visit today.  I know some of you, well, most of you, think i can be bossy and bitchy a lot of the time, and I realized where it all comes from.  its not because i'm an only child, and its not because i'm a spoiled brat, its because my mom is the bossiest woman you will ever meet in your life.  From the moment she walked in to see me all she did was order me around and complain that I couldn't take care of myself.  She didnt even give me a hug or a kiss until like 2 hours later.  then at the park during our barbecue she made the biggest scene out of me wanting to sit on one side of the table - no she wanted to move all our stuff over to the other side.  I took this shit from her all through middle school and high school and now I'm just done.  Screw her telling me how to take care of myself, screw her telling me what friends I should have.  And most importantly... SCREW HER TELLING ME I'M FAT!!!  I know I'm no supermodel, but its not as if I'm disgustingly obese.  Stop trying to buy me size large when YOU KNOW I can wear medium.  Stop telling me what to eat and taking the fork out of my hand halfway through a meal when you think I've had enough.  Stop comparing me to every other girl you see in the store.  Just because you're insecure about having an overweight daughter doesn't mean I have to be insecure about myself.

That being said, it's really scary to see myself turning into my mother.  Her insecurities are rubbing off on me.  Her bossiness and her attitude are rubbing off as well.  I wonder if we all ultimately turn into our parents...

Thanks to Dave and Jeremy, and everyone else who was there, I swung on a swing set last night.  It was the fisrt time I went on a swing set since I was 13.  When i was little I used to go to Lander Elementary School by my house and swing there for hours on end every night in the summertime.  Then When I was 13 I got surgery and I tried swinging after that and I almost fell off - I think deep down I always really missed it.  So I really love you guys for making me do that last night, I guess it was kind of a resolution I needed.  Anyway, I was all excited this morning and I told my mom about it and she got really pissed at me for doing that - she said i was irresponsible and told me to never do that again.  She also said that you guys (my friends here) didnt know my strengths and weaknesses well enough to do that.  I think you all know my strengths and weaknesses pretty well - in some cases, better than she does."

"event","hmm, what did i do yesterday - not much.  I studied a little bit for a chem test that I just got back from - it was insanely easy, i know i got an A and i finished in like 10 minutes.  Also, last night me, jeremy, and leah watched ""Ocean's Twelve"".  It was the most confusing movie ever with so many ""wtf"" moments where you just have no clue where they are coming from. 

 
(if you actually want to see this piece of crap movie i suggest you stop reading now)

First they have to get into a house that has the most high tech security system known to mankind - and guess what, there's a conveniently open window - unfortunately the window is 6 inches too low for them to use it - so what do they do?  well, somehow within 24 hours they find a submarine with a bunch of column things that they place under the house (which is conveniantly built on a canal) and raise the entire house up 6 inches.  It makes you think, if they could have access to all that equiptment in order to raise up an entire house, wouldn't you think they'd come up with a cooler way to get in - other than through the window.  then they fail at stealing whatever it was that they were supposed to steal because some other thief got there first.  Oh, and Catherine Zeta Jones is playing a detective who somehow manages to figure out who stole the stuff, who ocean's ppl were that were trying to steal the stuff, and that there was a note left behind - all from a single drill left at the crime scene.  then ocean's guys try again and they get arrested while trying to walk into a museum - so again you ask, if they were smart enough to get a fully loaded submarine within 24 hours and come up with a master plan to steal a faberge egg using 3d holographic imagery, wouldn't they be smart enough to stay away from the museum when they saw cops swarming the place?  Then Julia Roberts playing Tess has to pretend that she is Julia Roberts so they can get into the museum and Bruce Willis pops out of nowhere for no good reason, then they get arrested again.  then Matt Damon's mom is introduced for about 30 seconds and she bails him out of jail, then some random guy is doing tai chi on the bank of a pool.  And to top it all off, with 10 minutes left in the movie Brad Pitt comes up to Catherine Zeta Jones and tells her ""remember the father you thought was dead, well I found him for you.""  now, this is the first time her dad's been mentioned in the entire movie - then he makes a quick appearance for about 30 seconds - just long enough to tell you that he was behind the whole plan.  So of course, in true deus ex machina fashion, Catherine Zeta Jones switches sides, falls in love with Brad Pitt and they all live happily ever after.  all i can say is ""WTF!!!!!"""

the last entry on many of them is something along the lines of ""this journal is gonna be friends only from now on"" - it kinda makes you think just how much drama lj creates when you see people becoming friends only after a while - also makes you think about the ljs that you read that are public and  VERY personal and what kind of drama thats gonna cause in their lives.

theres an lj out there where this teenage girl puts up pictures of all the cross stich things that she does - thats her whole life - she's like 16 and her whole life is cross stich.

I stumbled onto a journal that was in Russian, written by some lady in Moscow - oh the irony."

"event","OMG - last night was so AWESOME.  I love the masque - SOOOOOO much better than celebs.  I'm so glad that leah went with us - i always knew she was a partier - she just had to get out there and show it.  anyway, everyone was getting hit on all night - Jay had like 5 different guys on him.  The place was really packed after a while and carly was practically dancing on top of me.  Then, right before we left some random guy grabs me and starts dancing with me - he was pretty cute too.  jay and Carly start cracking up when that happens.  Jay was like grinding with me half the night - when he wasn't grinding with leah or being hit on by random guys.  Anyway, I was thoroughly impressed - the Masque rocks - and it has elevators so i could even go to the lounge area upstairs.  What an awesome night.

Anyway before that jeremy, me, leah, and jenny went to meijers to go get fruit and yogurt stuff for his parfait - it was delicious and nutritious. (how the heck do you spell ""nutritious"")

Classes have been good - I procrasticate like none other though - i really have to stop that, I have 3 hours before my lab today and a heluva lotta stuff to do so I'm gonna go try to make something useful of myself."

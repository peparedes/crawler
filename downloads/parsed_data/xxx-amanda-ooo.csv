"event","<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=2>I'm having a pretty good day so far! Last night I talked to Davey.. yeh he was drunk lol, but funny. His cousin John talked to me for a little bit, and he seems to be really cool. I really like the ppl Dave hang out with. His mom seemed so nice on the phone when I talked to her, and of course, cool because she was partyin'! I definitely wanna meet these people. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=2>Also last night I got my tongue ring back in! YAY!! That is SOO awesome for me. I took it out for work like 3 months ago, and it's been since then that I've had it out. Really I had my doubts about accomplishing my goal to put it in again since it was closed up for so long, but I did it! And I am proud! In pain, and the tongue is swollen, but I'm proud. Davey said I sound like I have a lisp now, so I hope it's corrected soon, preferably before the work day starts.. if not, oh well.. what do ya do? I'd take a lisp with the fact that I have a cool piercing that not many ppl I know have..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=2>Other than that cool news, I've been layin' outside, gettin tan since everyone I know has been going on vacation and comin back tan.. So I thought I'd fit in and make it LOOK like I've been somewhere this summer, even tho I did go to Key West and Mexico on a cruise in May. That tan didn't last too long.. I just have to accept the fact that I'm a whitey.. doesn't mean I can't still try!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=2>As far as the bf thing goes, I really wanna be w/Dave. He's the best thing that's happened to me since I've been here in C-bus. I just have to find the courage to break up w/ my bf... I'm sure he'd understand, me being young and all. But it's still hard to be the one to initiate the break up. I just have to remember to cancel out BlockBuster account. Yeh that was stupid, but I thought I'd be nice and let him have a card, too... wow I'm stupid. I'm not saying he'd put charges on my account like that, but ya never know...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=2>So while I'm anxiously awaiting the arrival of my Davey, I've been applying to jobs online.. hopefully I'll hear something back! I need full time, man! My sis is going to be putting in a good word for me to fill her position at United Healthcare once she leaves. She puts together binders for business proposals and she makes lik $18 an hour.. I'm thinkin' hell yeh! I need that job! I'll take it.. she said that she'll tell the ppl I'm good for it and blah blah blah.. I'm keeping my fingers crossed!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=2>Well that's about it for now.. Yes I do have poems, I just need to revise them a lil then I'll post 'em! </FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#cccccc size=2>I've been lonely lately.. I don't know why either. I guess it's because it's just me and the puppy doggy hangin' out here and nobody else. It wasn't so bad when Nate was here.. at least I had someone to talk to. Now he left and I'm stuck cleaning up after his messes he didn't take care of before he left, and I don't want Jake and Rachel coming home to a trashed house, plus I can't stand to see a messy house. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cccccc size=2>I shouldn't feel lonely because I have my most amazing friend, Dave to talk to and hang out w/... but I couldn't see him tonite because I got off work a lil late and couldn't make plans that late. I wanted to see him before he leaves for Jersey, but I don't know how that will work out now. I'm working a long day tomorrow and Sat., 9:30 to 9 and I have to go see my bf to have the talk I've been waiting to have for awhile now. I just wanna get all this shit off my chest and get it over with so I know where to go from here. I have a lil problem. I like him, he's great and all but I don't know if I'm really happy. Plus I have someone else on my mind.. and of course you know who you are... it's just that, I'm afraid of risking a friendship to have something more. Plus I have to know my limitations due to the fact that I am currently in a relationship, and I have to stay loyal. Of course I don't think it's wrong to have feelings for someone else as long as you don't act on them, and if you take affirmative action towards what it is you want and you do it right away w/o hesitation. I'd do that if I knew what I want. I'm so confused... but I know it is wrong to have feelings for someone else but stay in a relationship where you know you're not happy.. I guess what I'm waiting for is to know where my current relationship stands. That's what the talk is to be about.. I have no idea what he wants with this relationship, etc.. so I have to find that out. All that is so stressful. I'd rather have no interests at all than to have more than one. It'd be so much better for me. And I hope to not hurt the most genuine, sweet guy I've met so far. It's hard to know how to act when you want something more than you have w/ him, but you know if you say or do more than what your limitations are, there is danger of being hurt on both ends of the stick.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cccccc size=2>Aside from my love turmoil, I really am lonely because I miss my fam. They're awesome people.. and my sis said that she and her husband are going to go back to Woodsfield this weekend from Lima to visit.. I'm so jealous! I'm staying here because I gotta take care of Brittany.. on the bright side, she's stopping by on their way back to visit me and we're going to go out for lunch together. I haven't seen my bro-in-law in a few months. I really like him and I'm glad my sis married him. I hope they live happily forever and ever... it's a dream I have for myself, too.. I don't want any divorces.. what a mess! Plus when you marry, you promise yourself to that person.. you promise you'll love them no matter what and that you'll work things out when things get rough, and if you really are in love, there's nothing you can't work out. I hate hearing about ppl divorcing. I guess ppl change, but that's something you have to work through together, and you can' do that unless you communicate. Too often that's why ppl divorece.. Lack of Communication!! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cccccc size=2>Yeh I am rambling.. I guess that's what happens when I have shit on my mind.. I'm still trying to figure out how to use the net on my phone.. if I can't figure it out by next week, I'm havin' Dave look at it. He should know what to do!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cccccc size=2>I think I'm going to start goin to the gym Monday. I need to lose weight... I hate my body, and I even hated it lbs. ago. I weighed myself and I'm only 10 lbs. heavier than I was when I weighed the least I've weighed ever.. it's not bad, but I feel huge. It's so depressing. I'll never be happy w/ my weight. I shouldnt' complain because it could be worse, but it's all in my control.. so I'm going to take control and make myself happy. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cccccc size=2>I'm so tired right now but I don't wanna go to bed. I think it's because I know I gotta wake up to another depressing day. I hope I get happy soon... </FONT></P>"

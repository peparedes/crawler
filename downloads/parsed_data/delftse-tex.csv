Here's a catch-up
- Evil, evil European winter flu (out of commission for 2 weeks)
- Sad attempt at half marathon in the Hague one week after recovery
- Fantastic trip to Florence and Rome over an extended Easter weekend
- Remembered that Europe changes time in the spring one week before US
- Work, lots of it, to catch up from having been sick and away
- Joined two choirs here in one week; discovered voice is seriously out of shape
- Just learned that the Cardinal we saw celebrate Easter Vigil mass at St. Peter's in now the new Pope.
- Looking forward with mixed emotions (joy and holy terror) to a visit by mom and grandmother in just one week!"

"event","TWO new causes of celebration!

1. I have accidentally discovered that one of the grocery stores here in Delft sells Oreos.  This is possibly very, very bad in addition to pretty much making my day.  It's not that I've allowed myself to purchase them yet (it seems to be a package with several 6-oreo bags inside), but just knowing they are there makes the ocean seem a little smaller.  and maybe I'll run a little farther this afternoon in anticipation..

2. (and this is really big!) My verblijfsvergunning has come through! (temporary residence permit)
I could now technically enroll in a cel phone plan if I had anyone over here to call while riding my bike.  Unfortunately, the permit expires next year when my passport expires (doh!), and it remains to be seen whether I will have to fork over another 450 euros to reapply.
This new status in my new country (coming just days before my 6-month anniversary), as well as reading about the recent relocation/new culture adventures of K & S have me thinking about a fun theory of mine.  It is that settling into a new country (I think the language barrier is significant) has been like trying to pick up unix commands from scratch before the wealth of online help.  It was 9 (yikes!) years ago that I was sitting at the unix terminal, convinced that there would be a way to ftp files around, but having no idea where to start asking the man(ual) for help.  After trying everything I could think of, I finally had to call a friend who hooked me up with open(), get(), put() which was enough to get any more help I might need from man.  (today, I guess google would be that friend).  It is the same feeling of frustration - trying to work within a system that can't be seen - today:

Oh, I need to apply for a permit before shipping my own, used clothes to myself from a non-EU country or they will be seized by customs?  Uh, Ok..
Oh, I can buy tram and bus tickets at the post office instead of just the train station?  that's good to know (!)
Oh, the university would have reimbursed the cost of my bicycle (transport to work) if I had known about the right (Dutch) form?  that might have been nice..."

I am collecting a list of my favorite English-language words and expressions in Dutch-authored academic literature, and this finally seemed too good not to share with friends.  The most curious word of the week is ""Nowadays.""  I think that was the first time I have ever typed it, and I'm not even sure it is one I use in conversation frequently or hear on tv.  It is a favorite over here, though, and it stands out as the academic tone here is usually quite formal.

Previously, I was impressed by the frequent use of ""on the one hand.... on the other hand.""  I'm not sure whether it would have made such an impression without the ""the""s, but I again find it surprisingly familiar-sounding.

Note that these are not grammatical mistakes (possibly food for a future post), but everyday words that perhaps give insight into the common themes among the English schoolbooks here.

hmm.  It's something to think about while February persists in her daily sleet showers."

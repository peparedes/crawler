"event","It's close to midnight, and something evil's lurking in the dark. (There's a song in there, I think...) 

As we sat and talked with Dahlia, I began to feel a bit icky all over. I wondered if it was from something I ate, or if it was because I'm now stuck in the middle of prophecy.

The way I see it, there's two ways to look at prophecy. One can either sort of slide up along side it and follow it stealthily, influencing it subtly as it flows along, or one can meet it head-on and influence it, a sort of a crash-of-the-titans sort of moment. I don't know which type I am, though; I never intended to be a part of any sort of prophecy. Knowing that you're predestined to be a part of something you're really not cut out to be a part of is bloody terrifying. I'm a writer, not a warrior. And even if the pen is mightier than the sword, the words that I write down are so <i>not</i> the kind of words that'll cause a necromancer to come crashing down from his ebony tower.

There's a few patches of undisturbed ground over by the Riverford cemetary-- that's not good, not good at all. And there's a few patches of -very- disturbed ground, which is even worse. Everyone's talking about how there might be undead around here because of it, but I don't know, and that's because I don't really believe in the concept of the undead. I mean, I don't really understand how something can be ""un""dead. It's either dead, or it's alive, in my opinion. I think I'll just call them the moving dead.

Lurissa said about 150 or more graves had been disturbed. (I think Lurissa's just disturbed, but that's just my opinion and I'm stickin' to it.) To make matters worse, there are lots of scratching noises around the area. Satrisa and Lurissa and... well, we've talked about that before. All the 'uh' people. They're shouting about how more than 30 more graves are being scratched at from the inside, which is -really- terrifying. Each time they get near one of the graves, Satrisa and Dave are trying to get into each one and hurt the moving dead, and Satrisa-- she's still in big-and-scaly mode-- keeps trying to pull him up and out after he goes into the graves to stop them, and they keep going after him and grabbing his feet and being lifted out trying to eat his brains which are still warm and in his head, not in his feet. (Well, they're not always in his head. Not that head, anyway. Just ask the elven girls he was with before we left.) It's a really pretty stupid idea that they're trying-- even someone as non-heroic as me knows that.

Alyssa did something neat with her shaman magics, and the zombies went ""ka-poof"". With sound effects, too. I didn't know magic made sound effect noises-- well, maybe a little bit of of a poofing sound of rushing air escaping when the smoke explodes, but I didn't think that the moving dead made sound effects, either (other than calling out for ""brains"", because apparently zombies think that they're a delicacy-- sort of like the aristocracy in the Dark Lands, who seem to think that chilled monkey brains taste good too, and that's just... ew).

As for Alyssa, the more I think about it, the more I think I -could- make an actress out of her yet, if I could convince her to run away from this madness with me, in that sort of naive way (which would be kinda terrible the other days of the week), like some innocent ingenue who--

Never mind, journal. I'm using acting terms for someone who's just not a performer like me. I don't think she would ever run away with me-- especially not now that there's prophecy involved. She's a hero... I'm just the bard.

So when the day arrived and the zombies went back to being, well, deader than dead, Dave and I went around the village looking for stuff. I wasn't so thrilled about going anywhere alone with Dave, but he and I had a very long talk about my ears, about touching them, and about all sorts of good and bad things that one can and must do around Tigreans. He's not so bad once you get him away from the babes and booze. I think he and I have come to an understanding at long last, which is good. I might-- just might-- be able to get along with him now. (Now I just want to get up the nerve to touch Alyssa's ears. So soft and so delicate, with those so-exotic spots instead of stripes. And I want to see if those spots do indeed go all the way down, since they seem to continue on her tail. Her tail... For someone who was a slave, she has a -really- nice tail... [insert purring sound here, journal].)

We counted more than a dozen shops that still had viable stuff in this town. So we went around and collected anything and everything that we could find in order to try and supply everyone here-- the five heroes and me. We found a lot of basic stuff around the city-- a little bit of food, most of which was spoiled, but no weapons; anything that we could really properly use was all taken away, stolen by the moving dead. We <i>did</i> find a box with a bunch of rings, however, and a barrel full of really, really good ale, the kind that actually has a sealed barrel and a neat symbol burned into the top of the barrel. At least, that's what they tell me. So I'm not going to touch it, because Satrisa says she can sell it for a lot of money. But it <i>smells</i> potent... and even I, who doesn't like ale at all, might try a sip if we have to crack open the barrel at some point. We also found a bunch of vials of some really good stuff, including a little bit of what they said were healing potions and super-healing potions-- at least, that's what the labels said. (That's actually beginning to become fun-- being the only on knows how to read or write.)

So since the others are poofing and making the zombies all sorts of roasty-toasty, we're spending a couple days here to take care of it all. We're divvying up a bunch of the neat things Dave and I, um, procured-- bows, javelins, and so much more, and we're trying to do it all before we really need to sleep. And I'm enjoying the thought of making a sort of camp here-- because there are a couple of really fancy houses here, places with actual beds to sleep on. The ground makes my fur chafe, and a good feather bed sounds absolutely wonderful right now. I'll write a bit more, journal, over the course of the next few days while they take care of zombies and I go looting-- erm, procuring-- and while I get a chance to watch the heroes in action during the week."

"event","The more we sit here, the more I think about what I know about this part of the world. About 2000 years ago, there was an ancient empire that had its borders about a month's travel from what became Riverford, an empire that broke apart and shredded because they were too generous to the others around them. Petty warlords and even pettier nobles took advantage of the generosity and the open borders, destroying that once-proud land. Many of the nobles in this part of the modern world can trace themselves back to the nobility of that empire, such as it was, and can still draw upon that history even now among the citizens of the realm.

Riverford itself was founded a couple hundred years ago by a coven of witches, powerful women, but over time the order they had founded moved on to another place after consecrating the lands and the great stone to Elethay. In due course, a band of settlers took over the lands they witches had blessed, and the village was born. In order to protect the town and the powerful Channel Stone that had been laid there, the people buried the stone in the town square, calling the place the Heart of the Earth and making sure never to build on that sacred land.

Today we're starting by walking to Riverford, which is a good thing. I want to see what's in the giant hole. Lurissa is telling us that things aren't very nice around here-- it's cold, there's a lot of dust, and a lot of destruction everywhere-- like it's way beyond being a ghost town. It wasn't like this when she left with the refugees a few weeks ago. I'll write more later-- we're getting near the city now, and just like always, if I don't put down my writing they'll be mad at me.

**

There's was something really ghostly there in the city, and it hurt Alyssa! No! Bad spirit-ghost-thing! I-- Well, okay. I kinda ran away screaming because it screamed at her and then I got in front of her and it made me run away. I tried to protect her... really... but I guess I'm not cut out for the hero thing. Which makes me little more than a hack writer, I guess. So that's what I'll do, then... go write some more.

There's something about ancient witches being talked about over there by Foxy and Lurissa, and the spirit thingy isn't screaming and mad and evil anymore. I'm trying to listen, but it's really kind of difficult when they're all talking softly and talking to spirits and doing stuff that I really don't understand just yet. But it does make sense that the spirit-thingy is one of the witches of old, remaining tied to the city to keep the stone protected. I guess she woke up when the channel stone was stolen from its burial place.

There was a darkness that came to her village and took over the spirit-lady Daliah (dah-LEE-ah), the witch, went mad. Foxy apparently purified the spirit-lady, which was good-- I told you she was a hero. As I thought, Daliah was the protector of the channel stone she called the Heart of the Earth, and when the stone was stolen she went mad. Apparently a group of undead stole the channel stone, which means a necromancer took it. (I keep asking how something can be un-dead. Doesn't that mean it's alive? But they keep telling me that, know, un-dead doesn't mean alive, even though the words would be the same. Some things, I guess, are just more alive than others.) She keeps talking about a darkness in the east, that the world is howling in pain, towards the Ruins of Grilarr-- wherever that is. It must be somewhere to the east of here, in the lands of the ancient empire. (I really should have studied more about that, I think.) In order to help them out as they travel, Daliah gave us each a gift, leading the way to a small cache of offerings made by the witches to be used in time of desperate need.

Veruca got a bunch of bones, bones that tie her into the powers of the spirit world. 

Dave got a really big sword that bears the sigil of one of the ancient dragon clans-- the Zachtos clan, I think, if I'm reading it right. I didn't get to see it very well.

Alyssa got a rock with runes on it. There are four kinds of magic in the world. Wizardly magic is really powerful and can hurt quite a bit, but that kind can only be taught and learned from books. There's also shaman magic, which calls upon the powers of the spirits. Witchcraft is strange, eerie stuff that calls a lot upon the earth and the mind. And there's rune magic, which kinda works with all three and ties it all together by being able to augment and manipulate spells that are being cast by speaking or manipulating the runes to go with it. It's not truly a separate magic by itself, but I think that as more people begin to use it that it might just become more powerful.

Lurissa got one of those really neat charms that I've seen Alyssa and Satrisa use-- a charm that witches can store power in for use at a time when they need it the most.

Foxy got something just as impressive-- she learned something. Satrisa talks about how she doesn't want to learn anything because stuff like that is usually useless, but she learned something really powerful, apparently. Sometimes knowledge can be just as powerful as trinkets.

Speaking of trinkets, Dahlia gave me one, too-- she gave me one that will help protect me from some harm along the way, some kind of ward against spells. Good thing-- that way I can just be sliced to ribbons or shot up like a pincushion rather than char-broiled to perfection.

There's prophecy involved, too, and that's never good for anyone around it. I didn't catch most of it, but she talked about a bunch of people: The warrior. The student. The mentor. The scribe. The guide. The innocent.

Waitaminute. The scr--?

Oh, FUCK."

"event","Just before the morning, there was a loud noise that woke me back up-- some sort of taur came into camp, bleeding everywhere. For those of you reading my journal for the first time, taurs are giant lizardy-horsey things that combine the best of both worlds and have the intelligence of neither. Foxy says they make better armor than pets, and I'm inclined to agree. But it was hurt and bleeding everywhere and Dave was trying to get the javelin out out it. He couldn't alone, but I overcame my fears and helped him get it out of the poor creature so I could help healing. And then the big rat came and scared Dave, which is bad.

The taur is following me. I'm calling it Carl. (Wait. Foxy says it's a girl-taur. I'll call it Carla. <strike>Foxy said to call it Carlita, but Carlita's the name of a whore and I don't want to call her that. [Alyssa said that's what Foxy is, but Foxy corrected her and said she's a slut, not a whore. I asked if she made money being a slut, and she just kind of ignored me.]</strike>) So then Satrisa picked us all up-- including Carla-- and flew us off to Riverford. Well, we didn't fly right away-- we kinda all fell off the big-dragon Foxy because we didn't tie the rope down very well. I hurt my nose, but there's really a neat imprint of my body on the ground.

We finally got on the road-- well, okay, it wasn't really the road, but into the sky. We started out today by flying, which is good and quick. But when we got close to the village of Riverford, there was a giant hole in the middle of the city, and that's not good, because it wasn't there before according to Lurissa. So Foxy took us away from the main part of the village and set us down about half a day's journey away from Riverford to a really nice place. It gave us all a little bit of a brief headache and made Carla all sorts of horny. Apparantly taurs get horny in really clean land. So we had to find a place to tie her off, and we rested the rest of the day because we needed to get healed up just in case there's a fight. I really hope there isn't, because I don't fight very well, even with my sword.

Foxy came over and helped me fix Carla, which was very nice of her. I was trying to be all quiet and alone and just listen to what else everybody was saying and doing while cleaning up her wounds, but she was nice enough to come over and help. One of the things she can do as a witch is to use her magics to heal someone who's hurt-- something I learned a lot about a few nights ago when we were playing around with some zombies after the dwarves tried to get me drunk and started calling me Frank. (That's another story entirely, dear journal, and one I don't think you really want to hear anything about.) But anyway, Satrisa came and helped, and together we talked about a few things-- about why I was here, about my place with this group, about shifters. She tried to convince me that she wasn't a hero, but I know better. She's a foxwings, a dragon, and most of all, she's a hero-- something I'm definitely not. Remind me to write something down about her later, journal... she has a lot of good stories to tell.

A lot of what happened the rest of the day while we rested was me listening to everyone else and really saying not much of anything. The others, when they talked about me, just sort of did so with the polite dismissal of a child-- something I guess I deserve, in a way, because of my relative inexperience in dealing with the world. Kinda the same way that Alyssa has certain inexperiences with the world. I mean, how could a young Tigrean girl not know that letting someone touch her ears like that-- even rub her ears!-- is the same thing as reaching down a human's pants  or groping an elf's chest or tugging on a dwarf's beard? But then I learned she was a slave until not that long ago, and she's trying to learn the ways of her people, so I guess I can forgive her. And Dave, too, because the more I think about it, the more I'm thinking he really didn't know that touching me like that was wrong.

But getting back to the party... I think they think I get in the way when I do my job, which really kinda sucks to be me in that regard. I'm here to try to chronicle the exploits of a band of professional heroes as they rid the land of evil, but every time they do something and I try to help it seems to backfire. Even when I tried to get up the courage to say something to Alyssa while I was teaching her to see in the dark, I failed miserably. There was even a good chance to talk to her or see her or watch her as she was taking a nice, long bath in the river... but I just couldn't do it. I just sorta stood there, behind the trees, on the river bank like some sort of pervert, while trying to screw up the courage to say something to her, until I just sorta slinked back away from everyone and everything to write this all down.

As a flirt and a bard, I so totally <i>suck</i>."

"event","It was a dark and stormy night, and--

Okay, it really wasn't. It was a nice night, actually. Starry skies, no clouds, the moon shining bright... nothing even remotely out of the ordinary. It included a nicely bright and sunny morning that we found the next morning as we got ready to set off for Riverford. It's a long way away from here, really. And the ""we""? Well, there's six of us.

Well, first there's Dave. He's a human. A barbarian of a human, too. And he's raped me at least twice by touching my ears. I wanted to take my claws to him, but I didn't think that was a good idea. Especially since he can turn into a really big dragon. He doesn't always watch where he's going when he does, though, which is really bad for anyone around him. It's a good thing I stay out of his way. He is one of two men in this little merry band-- him and me. I think he's bi, too, because he keeps raping me, but he does a lot of fooling around with loose women. But not the women who are traveling with us, because they're not loose. (Even if the fox one walks around naked. But more about her later.)

Veruca is a bit of a bitch-- literally-- but only when she wants to be. And that's not really a bad thing, because she can turn into a big wolf or an even bigger werewolf. I don't know much about her because she keeps to herself most of the time. But I think she has some sort of magic about her. She keeps talking to herself. A lot. Especially when I'm around, but I think that's because I inspire a lot of that sort of behavior in people.

Lurissa does that a lot, too-- talking to herself, I mean. I think it's because she's a witch-- I think. She talks to spirits and works with the earth itself-- which is also really neat. But I think I really should stay out of her way, because she loses her patience with me an awful lot. I don't blame her in that regard... but then, not everybody can handle the unique talents that a bard brings to the table. I don't know if she can turn into anything, though. Actually-- yeah, she can. Because she showed up as a dragon.

Then there's the foxy Satrisa. Really foxy. Because she's, well, a foxwoman. With wings. I think they're even called foxwings. She can get scaly, too, but tiny and scaly. Baby dragon. Tiny baby dragon-type thing. But she's really, really powerful, I think-- the most powerful of all six of us. She's naked a lot of the time-- I really don't know why, because the only time I've seen naked women were when men were trying to run up to the stage they were on and put money in the little box in front of the stage. She flies around a lot, too. She and her griffit. We have a lot of pets in our group... a griffit, a dragonette. The girls talk about being really familiar with their pets which is kinda sick and twisted, but to each their own.

Finally, there's Alyssa, who's a kitty-person like me, only she has spots instead of stripes. She's really cute, but I'm not about to tell her that. Especially since I really like her a lot. I think she likes me, too, because she told me to get off and that I was making her wet. (Usually that sort of talk gets my tail pulled by those who are less understanding.) She reminds me a lot of a girl I knew back home a long time ago, who I was kinda banished from the village for seeing. Well, it wasn't really seeing her as much as taking her virginity on the night of the Harvest Moon. (It wasn't like she didn't want to... she suggested it, really. And it was -really- good! But of course, they all blame the guy...) She can go all scaly when she's not furry, which is really neat. I wish I could do something like that, but I guess that I really can't. I wish I could get the courage to talk to her, too-- really -talk- to her, not like when I'm teaching her how to see better night. That's one thing... actually -talking- to her is another.

And then there's me.

I'm Kellen. Kel, for short. But they call me Frank, which is just fine with me. I'm all sorts of fuzzy and furry-- I'm a big kitty-- but they keep telling me that I can change into something else, too. I think they're full of it. (I know the human is. Most humans are.) 

The first night out, well, it went pretty well. I tried to teach Alyssa how to see well in the dark. It didn't work too well the first night, but she looks like she can learn very well. And I found out that she doesn't know how to read. Nobody else in our group seems to. (Satrisa was even kinda making fun of the fact that I can read. She maybe be able to beat stuff up, but the fact that she made fun of reading really kinda bugs me.) But other than that, it was a really kinda boring night."

"event","It rained a lot in the middle of the day. A good rain, really-- not that hideous green rain that everybody complains about. I got caught in one once, a long time ago, and it really stank to be in that rain.

There's a bit of lightning in the distance after a little while, and they're calling it a Dragon Storm-- which sounds like something great for dragons to bathe in, but it's really not. It's kinda icky-- very icky. We need to find shelter really quickly. I'll write more about this later when it's not really raining anymore.

**

Well, it's later. There was a lot of praying going on when the icky green rains and lightning came closer. Satrisa and Lurissa and Veruca and Alyssa-- basically anyone whose names end with ""uh""-- started praying, and there was this neat bit of magic and the green rain was kept away, while Dave and I set up the tarps to keep everything as dry as we can-- dry enough for me to write a little more. The pets started to curl up around their masters, which was kinda cute in that soft-and-cuddly kind of way. But there's something out there, and it's moving closer as the storm passes us by. I'll write a bit more later after we find out what's out there, since Dave is shouting ""Ow!"" a lot and there was some fire off to the side (that's why the top of this page is kinda charred).

**

Wow! That was all sorts of really cool and wicked and scary and everything else kinda majorly emotional! Satrisa-- Foxy-- told us that she really wanted to kick some ass, but she was praying really hard, so I guess she was kicking ass for the lord. Or the lady. Whichever.

It was really messy... five of what they kept calling mad spawn. I didn't see why they were so mad at us, really, but I guess they couldn't be called happy spawn if they were trying to hurt us. They were really big and more than a little bit scary and spitting fire at everyone. And I got spit on twice, and once by the plants that were shimmying and dancing and swaying and spitting acid at us all. Well, mostly at me. Because I did something that I thought was brave but was actually really kinda stupid. I ran outside the shield, the invisible thing they made when they were praying. Yeah, I know... but hey-- I got to do the same thing that Veruca and Satrisa and Lurissa and Alyssa-- well, everyone with an ""uh"" again-- got to do, and I actually got to KILL one! I'm a warrior at last! (<strike>And then a ran like a little girl back behind everybody and tried really hard not to throw up all over myself.</strike><i> Nobody really needs to know that. Not if I'm writing this for posterity, because there are just some things that posterity doesn't need to know.</i>)

Lurissa just shouted what I think is going to our new battle cry: ""Death to the salad!!"" At least, I think it's going to be <u>my</u> new battle cry. Which was good, because there were a lot of plants out there-- ugly plants that were moving around and a lot closer to us. Everybody's stomping all over the salad, and it almost looks like a chef's salad out there, except for the eggs. Plenty of meat, plenty of veggies and plenty of leaves. But no eggs. And no cheese, either, really. Which would just be really gross, especially out here in the middle of the plains.

Well, after the fight, all heck sorta broke loose. Alyssa had her paws all over me-- which would have been kinky in just about any other situation, really. But she was trying to keep me from jumping all over Lurissa, because when she mouthed off to me I mouthed back and then she started to sound like she'd either been taken over by the devil or had a bad case of indigestion. (They really do sound the same, actually.) Either way, Lurissa was bouncing on the ground and twitching and convulsing and all sorts of other major badness until Foxy went and did some of her mumbo-jumbo on her. And then they told me to shut up when I wanted to actually find out if she was gonna be okay. Then Dave offered to help by holding me down when things were going a little better, but I think he just wanted to do very bad things to me.

I tried to help Alyssa a bit more at the end of it all learn to see better at night. She's learning well and might be able to do it soon enough. A few more nights of working with me, and she'll be able to do it fine enough. But it's getting more and more dark, and I'll let her wake the others up because they don't like me very much for some reason. I think they're mad at me because I've been writing this all down while they're doing the fighting, but I'm allergic to pain. They can all shift and change and become something huge, and I'm just a big pussy. Cat. Thing. But somebody has to chronicle the adventures of a bunch of heroes, and it's the toughest job of all to put them in the best light. Even when the dragon witch is shooting me with evil glares and talking about fucking. And Foxy is talking about raping me. And I won't even say what Dave is doing, because he's just a sick bastard. But humans are like that. Heroes are really dirty-mouthed and dirty-minded in battle, I guess. Which isn't very good. But regardless, I'm here because somebody has to write this all down for the next generation, and the generation beyond that, and the generation beyond that, because if they don't... well, I'm sure something menacing would happen if they don't.

I'm just trying to help is all... and I'm wondering if I'm as much in the way as anything else."

"event","Well, I did it. I finally buckled down and bought a few sheets of parchment paper and some fresh ink at long last-- something I should have done a good long time ago, but I've never really been able to scrape the money together. That's what kind of sucks about life on the open road. Which is where I've been a lot lately, but that's mostly because I've had no idea where to go, until I got here-- Esturil, that is.

There's a lot that I've needed to write about lately, I guess, and since I buried my first journal in the middle of the road along with a few trinkets of value-- okay, along with the stuff I stole from a farmhouse in order to have some clothes and a little food along the way-- I haven't had the time or the money to buy some fresh parchment paper until now.

There's a lot that's shaped my life in the last few days. Mostly because I showed up in this little farming village that doesn't seem to be so little anymore, since people are showing up here all the time. See, it seems that for a while the village was kinda teetering on the edge of extinction because there was a lot of raiding and plundering (can someone really plunder if they're not on a ship?) and killing of menfolk. But that's not happening anymore because a few really strange people got it in their heads to do something about it, and now the evil elves with wings apparently aren't evil anymore.

But it gets kinda bad from there, because this little farming village is taking on refugees by the armload, and it's gotten really kinda hard to move around. The little tent village at the outskirts is slowly beginning to turn into a real part of the city, and some of the people who have come from everywhere else-- including centaurs and winged elves and so much more-- are starting to actually build here. I think it's neat.

But other than that, I've met a bunch of strange people who want to talk in my head when it's really inconvenient. But I'll write more about them in the next few days, because I'm supposed to go on a trip with them-- a really long trip."

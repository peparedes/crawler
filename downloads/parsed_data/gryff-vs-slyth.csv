"event","Sometimes I wonder why. Why bad thinga happen to good people. Why for every good thing that happens something bad must. Why good people die, while all the bad ones get to live long and happy lives.

In July 2004, my uncle was shot and killed in Guyana, and I am never going to be over that. What's worse, is that the man that killed him, will never be brought to justice here on Earth. It pains me to know that someone I loved that much, was taken from this world without a second thought. Did that killer, murderer, not realize what he was doing? That he was killing a son, a brother, a father, an uncle, a cousin, and so much more?

And now, a little over a year later, another person is dead at the hands of a murderer who most likely won't be caught, and I feel like it's happening all over again. So why? Why him? He was a good man. He didn't do anything. He had kids, he had a family. Why did this have to happen to him. Why can't the punish the person that did this?

It sickens me, to know that this is the world we live in. Where there is no justice for the good. Where there is no peace. Where no one seems to understand the concept of family. It's painful, to think of another family going through what mine went through such a short time ago, and my prayers are with them. It's so... hard, to even fathom that this is happening, because it wasn't supposed to. It wasn't. Things like this shouldn't happen, but they do and there's nothing I can do about it. And that's what pains me the most: that no matter how much I want to, I can't move on, I can't forgive, I can't forget, and most importantly, I can't have them back. They won't come back to comfort their families, or to tell the world who the killers are. And I don't think I can deal with that.

And I just wonder why."

...
Okee, enough with the dramatics. (WHAT! There is NEVER an end to the dramatics! -cackles-)
... Am I on glue?

Aside from my lunacy, I'm actually quite busy. Keeping up in my classes, handling Lit Mag, and then Yearbook (Oyyyy, what a NIGHTMARE that is turning out to be. Damn me and my journalism major) and now dancing for my beloved cousin-brother's (Look at me and my realationship defining skills! LOOK AT ME!) 21st Birthday extravaganza! I baked him a chocolate fudge cake yesterday. It looked SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO (cannot stress the SO enough) good. And you know what? THOSE MALE BASTIDS ate it. The females in the family, that is to say myself, sisters, and cousin-sister's (LOOK AT MY SKILLS) didn't get anything. Parents, aunt's and uncles were not included in this celebration as it was chance for all of us to 'throw our hands in the air like we just don't care!' (Glue=Bad) So, tomorrow, I shall make another chocolate fudge cake just for the ladies. <33 While I try to learn this dance. Alas, I do believe a drunken potato could learn the damned dance quicker than I ever could. Blast.

Right, so that I've completely convinced you all that I'm off my bloody rocker, I bid you a good day, Peace Out, and all the reasons why you should stay off the glue.

On the real side, I'm better than I was before. I no longer get such strong urges to be all destructive and the like, but I still just feel the need to get away from it all, although I'm told that is completely normal. Last weekend's engagement party was TONS of fun, although I get so skeeved out when 30+ year old men try to hit on me. While it's no longer illegal, that still is very, very wrong. I am a young and [i]innocent[/i] child! *And here, my brother laughs hysterically. The bastid.* Besides all that, there are now old construction worker people who seem to like making gross and suggestive comments as I make my way to the busstop in the moring. Isn't that wonderful.

Overall, it was a good book. While my favorite remains PoA, this is easily my second. It was emotionally gut wrenching. I cried from Chapter 26 all the way to the end. While the death was not so much of a shock, the circumstances surrounding it was. And while some may not feel the killer to be truly evil, I believe he is. He is cowardly and stupid and I just plain don't like him...

The school has been evacuated today. Someone pulled the fire alarm. :) High School is back!

So i have been having dreams. a lot. You knows those dreams you have when you wake up in your dream but your still dreaming......??   I never had one. until last night. I was at a bar on a date ""camel lights"". And we hit it off reall well but i drank too much and when i woke up (still dreaming though) My one freind says you guys were totally making out. But i dont remember because i drank too much so i kept screaming i want to remember!! I want to remember! so in my dream im on this couch saying this but its a party now i must have slept right into the next night. I dont want to party i want to find ""Camel Lights"". So i walk out the door and then wake up for real. ugh.


The night before i had this dream that i was living in canada. Going to this college there. I'm having a smoke with ""Camel lights"" but shes not talking to me. So we go into class and shes sitting right behind me. ECONOMICS CLASS?? anyway... we go to class and then to this like family party and no one is really talking to me except this friend of mine that refuses to get out of the corner of the room because she doesnt want anyone to know shes on drugs. oooook. The all of the sudden im on this huge green mountain. the whole thing is moss. and someone says to me dont wear your shoes your bound to get wet. so i take them off and its a contest with like 50 other people to get to the top of the mountain. barefoot we all start.... and it ISwet moss annd you totally sink into it so much that the more you try to go fast the harder it is to climb. Its sunny and hot is hell i do well but im not first.once i get to the top a huge bolt of lightning strikes near me and it starts pouring it was beautifull looking out over the vast mossy moutain side and neighboring plains.twas great. Then ALL OF A SUDDEN im driving a pick up truck ""CAMEL LIGHTS"" is in the back seat. I make eye contact with her and she jokingly says ""You think that was real smooth dont ya?"" I say no just happened that way and she says ""good""
Then i woke up
WTF

Lesson Learned from the dreams

Soooooooo after work tonight im bound to go out. ""Camel Lights"", bound to be there. Dont drink to much or youll forget, bound to hit it off, thats good. Ignore the girl in the corner shes just lonely. Finish Some kind of test wich where there will be danger at the end. Remember to avoid it. Then it will rain and be beautiful..... Then i get Kudos for being smooth. and all will be well.     Im thinking though that mountain that im climbing is going to turn out to be longer than one night....  Im hurting myself cant think anymore.      Happy St. Patricks Day.   ALSO 

Talked to the ""black Widow""  shes trying to spin her web  again. I'm too wise for that nowadays. Lessons learned from mistakes are the best lessons, it sticks with you,you have been there down that road you werent told it you were there the memory of the wrong choice shows you the right ones. Vive la bella.

   uteri:
        1. Affectionately named by kin ""Black Widow"". Should have been a warning sign. Now that I see why, I am interested in how i got fooled. Quick talkers where never my slice of pie(always hiding the true words with many FAKE ones), but its not like i was listening anyway. Too busey looking at the hair I suppose.

        2. Out of the woodwork shes back. ""waitress without a cause"". Just a freind. She needs a freind. Shes what I want in six years. She says ""Have i ever told you how much i wished you were.....older?"" hmmm Have I ever told you how much i wished i was younger? ::sigh:: Shes too nice, I think I only like the ones that are bitches. Or so it seems...

        3. Crush alert: ""camel lights"" In town for spring break... if only...  right. Ive built up such an ideal about this one that  it would be bound to shatter.... the orginal blonde i would only make an exception for. Too afraid to speak or act myself in front of her. So i wont say anything... Not until shell be around for more than a month. There's a velvet rope around this one. A walking art Exhibit... look but dont touch. I touched once. Its nice to think about. well... she punched me in the arm once. but how many art lovers got punched in the arm by the mona lisa?
        
        4. If only YOU were older hun. ""Geeks"" were never more appealing. You make me smile. Thats tough. One day.. when your older...


      Career:    
            Cooking is cooking is cooking is cooking. Cook here there and everywhere in between. I have a family there. They are nice to me. ""Camel Lights is related""

            I going to win the lottery. I'm due for some magic.      and magic the gathering. :)

     Academics: 
         Should be doing home work rightnow but i need to get things off my chest. It been a while since i could.

      Family:
            Dad is having episodes.
            Granpa hates not being able to walk right.
            Federales showed up! Looking for my fathers brother. Alimony (Im never getting divorced.)


      Freinds:
          Too many. Hang out with none of them. I think i might have a disorder.

"event","Time Flies by when you dont pay attention to the people around you.

 Then you see them out of no where and you realize change. 

You see they have grown up, grown out, grown into their new surroundings got older, learned or failed and ultimately changed. Change is a little fear of mine. You sit there and think  about the past and how good it was or how good it might have been and then the realization bites you in the ass and says its not the present its not now, it may suck but get over it. Thats scary to me. To care about somthing so untangible. The inability to harness the past as it was, but as hindsight alone. You cant relive it or restore it, its gone.

At this age its tough to juggle what you want for the future and to preserve the relationships you have without forgeting people and places and adolescent tradtions you carry on weekly. Its scary to think one day you'll be so wrapped up in your life with a possible family and career you'll truly have no memory of all those great times.And when those memories come back and hit you like a brick wall, youll have no clue what those people are up to.

  For me it sucks, and its scary but its also comforting because every time that hindsight depression kicks in it makes me understand what matters most is now. as im writing this im living breathing and i have the opportunity to make more memories to miss in the future.

This summer does suck, and i miss people on here and off of here that i spent with last year but whatever we all meet new people and find new things to do. i just miss you all try to have a great summer ill see you around, if not i wish you the best. :("

"event","There comes a time in your life when what you think is reality comes into question.
You think ""how can this be?"" You realize your sences decieve you, your eyes lie and give illusions. Your nose smells bullshit. And what you feel, what you grasp in your hands is in fact a fantasy. BUT When you wake up from this dream world you are confused at first but then this ovewhelimg sence of freedom from disillusionment emancipates your eyes to see the truth.... the TRUTH that is really out there.

And thats why I now truly see that my friend is in fact BATMAN.

You see.... Up until now i thought he was just an average Joe. But i read with my own emancipated eyes that he infact is a superhero. Working day and night and day and night countless hours working as a videogame manager WHILE going to school to be an aerospace engineer to make the world a better place from evil.

And because he is so modest he never told a soul. Thus having this double life of an average teen AND  superhuman, religious, hardworking, ladies man, do-gooder. I know. you are asking yourself ""How does one juggle these two lifestyles? How can he keep such a convincing enormous secret?"" Well that is easy to answer.

He can fly.

While working at target he swiftly but secretly FLIES to his other job as a video game manager. where he works 45 hours a week.... making the videogame industry and his corporate employment that much stronger to fufill every kids' needs. Make kids happy = better world for everyone. From there He flies soooo damn friggen fast around the world that he reverses time long enough to go to school for engineering. He doesnt sleep.... he just flies.

I know i know.... you are all thinking this is impossible....  Crazy! I know its hard to believe but open your eyes! I did and now i see the truth.

Just so he could have some time for his friends he faked his termination at target and then became videogame manager at toys r us. He never became though.... at that point he was there for 2 years. but he ""became"" to conceal his other identity. Further keeping his secret he used irony. The irony that he got ""fired"" at his last job for stealing videogames now he is videogame manager at a different retail supplier. You all thought ""wow isnt that funny it cant be because hes a super hero and faked his termination to hang out with us"" I know but the truth is out now and that is the ultimate display a grace and modesty. Sacrificing your own reputation for others.

Don't let your past memories fool you.... the truth is hidden in a myspace.com profile. A profile that finally sheds the light on the past 2 years of a great friend and an ever greater person that has no debt to anyone. If ANYTHING we are ALL in debt to him.

I salute you BATMAN."

I mean if one of my friends really enjoys The great epic poem by homer entitled the Iliad,
They should really talk about it more. I would love to listen to his philosophical interpretation of the great epic. Greek Mythology is always interesting. if he enjoyed the iliad what does he thing of the odessy?? Or what translation did he select?

The love of great pieces of literature shouldnt be veiled by ones modesty! It should be embraced by discussion with debate over certain idioms or at least saying you like a certain part. And why. But that may be too much. anyways i digress.

For ones love of poetry displayed at girlfriends birthday parties and then shrowded until a blog asks you what your fav. book is...... is dissapointing.


I shouldnt jump to conclusions about someone until i read their profile where it is impossible to lie."

Itll be good. thats all just good. it will be so real without being realistically  discusting like reality tv and actors will be in it drafted from junior highschool and will be used by us so we dont have to use each other. Then we will throw them away when they arent interesting enough.

After sitting there for hours she took me to this  beautiful reservoir And sat and threw rocks for like a half hour. This girl is my best freind. Im going to miss her when i go on this trip. Mostly because i only have a short time with her because shes leaving for Notre Dame in august. That is going to be a bad day for me... The we went to NU to see raks at her dorm. Met her roommate sara. Really nice girl, told me to tell kellie how much i love her?? Then Jimmy the gay guy walked in...... wanted to know if i was gay.

"event","Well, the 4th for me was amazing. Went to rachels and played cards in her garage while it was raining.

I love the rain. Theres somthing about it that just makes me so happy. Its so life-giving and peaceful and relaxing. I hope it rains at rockbridge. Ever since i was little i was just facinated with water( the essence of life) falling from the sky on everyone. Just awsome.

then Myself rachel pat and aren went to the park when it let up raining. but we walked. so walking home it poured on us it was so awsome. I came home all wet, almost fell asleep in the shower. Then chris picked me up and went to arens to watch 2 hours of family guy dvd set. great show, great company.

cant wait for rockbridge!"

"event","Ummmm i think im screwed. Camp??? yeeea its June 14th i have no clue what is going on....     

IN other news  i wish i had money like a lot of it so I could round up a bunch of cool ass people have have a big party like in The Great Gatsby. and i would do this every weekend over the Summer in my big mansion. and cool ass people would come for miles(by invitation only) to my extravagant parties with unlimited everything...... food, drinks. There would be a band playing all the time. and a pool in the backyard. A big pool. And a hot tub. So everyone can swim under the STARS. And behind the pool would be a garden with palm trees and exotic flowers. My staff would be excellent. there would be a guy in the bathroom(girl for the girls of course) that would hand you hot towels and breathmints. Every third saturday of the month i would have giraffs walking around. i would have 5 huge rooms with big leather couches. These rooms would all have a color theme but like dark colors not like pastel because that might clash with the black leather couches. and in these rooms the lastest technology would be present and every videogame imaginable would be there. But thats not the arcade. The arcade is in the basement yeaaaa sweet i know. theres a pool table there too.there would be one room but this room wouldnt have a floor, it would have a ball pit.The dining area would be lit by candles lots of candles that would light up the huge dining room with ease. This room would be overlooking the stage.
Everyones fav. food would be there even if it has to come srtraight from Japan. and every piece of superman attire would be banned because it just shouldnt be existing in life, including tattoos....so that means shaq cant come. It would start at 6 pm and end at 4am. And it would be awsome and people would love it. But the most important thing about it is that people would get along and there would be nothing to fight about because if somthings or somones bothering you you can just go to a different room because there would be different people there. and everyone is cool as hell because i invited them so anyone would gladly help you with anything thats troubling you. Peacefull Fun. Just a way to celebrate Life.

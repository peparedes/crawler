"event","Government assistance: Something to be ashamed for using but in order to qualify you have to be so desperate that it's necessary immediately and then they make you wait at least a month to get it! WTF?! I need assistance on our heat and electric bill and they won't help until I get a shut off notice but half the time when I've talked to these programs they are out of money... so i have to wait until I have no other options and hope that THAW doesn't happen to be out of funds at that time! AAHHHHHGGGG!!!

I'm so fucking tired of living this way. I need out of this situation and I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel at all. I want to go to school and become a programmer but school takes time and its not a magic wand that makes you get a job it just gives you better chances than having no idea what you are doing. People with 2 degrees still can take a whole year to find a job and what am I supposed to do in that situation? And I'm having trouble finding enough money in the budget just to pay the application fee for school. We have a credit score of 400 so I won't be getting any loans for sure... I have to rely on grants and financial aid i dont have to pay back.

I'm stressed to the max and I just can't take it anymore.... It's affecting the kids and I just don't know what do anymore... I guess all I can do is focus on getting my license, hope the van gets fixed, and maybe i can get the kids in daycare and get a job. Unless its an awesome job we should be able to get daycare assistance."

"event","What am I to do when I can't seem to make a constant effort and tom's effort stays at the same level. In all honesty he does clean... but not like he should be considering he's home all the time. He expected 300 times more from me. The tub needs to be scrubbed, the bathroom floor needs to be cleaned, the front room needs to be picked and vacuumed and everything needs to be organized but the kitchen. The kitchen is pretty consistently clean at least when anything gets cleaned that always does. But the front room is rarely vacuumed and never really thoroughly done because there is always something cluttering the stuff that needs to be moved and vacuumed behind. i feel like I live in a pigsty and it's not all his fault but I just can;t seem to motivate myself when I realize how much crap really needs to be done and even making a dent seems to take forever... getting any appreciation for it never seems to happen at all.

But right now I need to stop venting and just go clean because I know I have ants in the carpet in one area and plenty to pickup and I just can't stand it anymore. I am going to get things as clean as possible tonight even if it means that's all I can get done."

"event","What could be worse than sitting just across the room from someone in your own apartment and not feeling like you are allowed to share a passing joke or something you read on the internet? Ok yes there are many things that could be a lot worse... but it's a horrible feeling. 
 
 We didn't have a fight... but he's sitting at his computer playing a video game with his headphones on and my little jokes or comments are nothing but an interruption and an annoyance to him because he has to move his headphones off his ears.
 
 I have a couple links to some business opportunities that I would like to be looking into right now but they are on his computer and he can't take a second to email them to me...
 
 What am I? I am Jack's cold sense of rejection...
 
 He's always busy with something and when it doesn't involve sex... it doesn't involve me. 
 
 Why don't I want to have sex with you, honey? Hmm... yeah let's think about this for a second and not ask the stupidest question in the world!"

"event","We bought a car Monday October 5th, 2009. It's a black supercharged 1998 Boneville. Needed a decent amount of work. Needed breaks and a new hub before they could even drive it to Rob's and they were able to do that work at the owner's house instead of towing it because it was my SIL's fiancee that sold it to us. It also needed a sway bar line(not sure if that's right?), heater core, new windshield, new side view mirrors, new tires, and a new a/c system... and that's just the stuff I remember. But it's a running car with a decent amount of room and the body only has two small rust spots on it. Tom and his brother already got it up and running well enough for Tom to get to his job interview today. <br /><br />http://www.facebook.com/editphoto.php?aid=158311&amp;success=2&amp;failure=0#/album.php?aid=158311&amp;id=580392278<br /><br />Speaking of his interview... He got an interview with peterson springs or something like that for an IT coordinator job that he knows he could do but he didn't actually meet the qualifications and he knew that when he applied. They called him in for an interview anyways! He even discussed it with the woman who setup the interview and she said to come in anyways. They want a bachelor's degree and experience in that position and he doesn't have either of those. So hopefully he'll get it for the sheer fact that anyone with a degree and experience in that is going to be asking for more than 45 to 50 grand a year and we already know that's all they are offering.<br /><br />Keeley went pee on her potty today again... it's not consistent but heck she's not even 2 and she is cruising along with her interest in using the potty. Plus I'm working all the time still so this is without much encouragement or coaxing from me because when I am home I generally don't have the energy to work with her much. She keeps asking to use the toilet but I can't let her have free access to the bathroom so I told her that the toilet is a privilege for little girls who are fully potty trained on the potty first. She said &quot;okay&quot; and immediately sat down on her potty when I told her that. So maybe that motivation will work for her because she really likes sitting on the toilet lol.<br /><br />Aiden has not had any setbacks in potty training lately... I just need to get him to start wiping himself after he uses the potty... right now he just kinda smears poop around when he tries to wipe himself so I'm always asking if he went poop or not so I can make sure I clean him up. I don't know if tom has been doing the same or not...<br /><br />The days are just flying by and any day now Keeley will be 2 and Aiden will be 3. I am only working until october 30th then I am going to be helping pack and prepare the apartment and house for the move. We have to move into the house in taylor at least one week early so there will be enough time for us to clean the walls and carpets and floors and just in general make sure we get our deposit back. We need to plaster a couple spots like behind the couch and on aiden's wall where  he &quot;hurt the wall&quot; with &quot;the hammerrrr&quot; and despite what tom thinks I think we are going to have to repaint at least in the living room and Aiden's room.<br /><br />As for Aiden and Keeley's birthday we are doing a get together to save money and just planning on a real party with guests and everything in january once we are all settled in and the big holidays are over with. Basically it'll be a late birthday/housewarming party. Hopefully by then the kids will have some new friends in the neighborhood to invite. In fact while I'm thinking of it I might as well look up playgroups in that area....<br /><br />I still don't have my license but once the windshield and everything gets fixed on our &quot;new&quot; car I'm going to practice parallel parking, read the new driver's book to make sure I don't unknowingly do something illegal during the test, then as soon as we have the money I'll get my permit and set up the test. God I get a little nervous just thinking about taking the test... I just definitely won't go back to the same place because the woman that failed me the only time I took the test was staring coldly at me like she had no soul and was trying to take mine! *shudders* ehhuheuh...(onomatopoeia is not my specialty but that's the best i got for the sound you make when someone creeps you out and you shake it off lol)<br /><br />The kids' get together is on October 24th, 2009 at 3pm at our apartment and chances are I'll be working that morning! ugh*rolls eyes* but my mom and sister are planning to come help tom get everything ready that needs to be...I haven't decided what we are going to be eating though... <br /><br />pizza is expensive and they no longer deliver to our complex because at least one delivery guy got robbed and they decided they weren't going to put their drivers in danger even though it happened at another complex too so it wasn't an isolated incident... but they probably stopped delivering to there too. And yes word must travel fast because all the pizza places stopped delivering here almost immediately!<br /><br />I could make subs but i want to have a nice casual get together at our apartment and not be slaving over the stove.<br /><br />I think I might just have my mom bring a card table to set up with lettuce, tomato, mayo, turkey, ham, peanut butter, jelly, butter, salami, and bread so everyone can just make their own sandwiches. That way it could be setup the whole time and people can eat whenever they get hungry. I think that'll be our best bet.<br /><br />My sister and mom are making two cakes for the get together. One is going to be rocket from the little einstein's based on the design in the picture at the top of this page <a href=""http://www.andreasrecipes.com/2006/11/11/little-einsteins-rocket-birthday-cake/"">www.andreasrecipes.com/2006/11/11/little-einsteins-rocket-birthday-cake/</a> but my sister really wants to make Leo, June, Quincy, and Annie out of fondant... I suggested marzipan but my mom said fondant is supposed to be easier... whatever I'm done arguing about it they have to deal with it not me. The other cake is going to be lightening mcqueen from cars which will be much easier seeing as they are going to use a wilton 3d cake pan from amazon and the dye kit for the icing. These cakes are my sister's gift to the kids... they were so excited when they saw the pictures of ideas for the cakes that they started freaking out and begging for lightening mcqueen and rocket cake! Just imagine when they get to see it right in front of them in person!<br /><br />Oh I almost forgot the kids both learned to do somersaults on October 6th, 2009 when Aiden accidentally fell over while standing and putting his head on the ground so I taught him that that was called a somersault. Keeley then stood with her head on the floor so I taught her to push off with her feet and here's the video of what she got out of me saying push up with your feet.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""10""/>"

"event","So much has been going on and I never renewed my lj subscription so I really died out on writing in my journal. But I really need to write in it to help me remember how I have been feeling and remember little events that my horrible memory would lose track of very quickly otherwise.

It's impossible to sit down and type a long entry or even a short entry catching up this journal at this point. I will do my best though.

First things first, what is going on right now?

A lot of things have been going on... my marriage has been really shitty and in general I've been stressed out to the max. I got a job at American Greetings in the mall last time I posted an entry and I really do like it a lot... but a job is a job and does not come without stress. Especially when you haven't worked outside the home in 3 years and you miss your kids and it was supposed to be part time but starts out at 28-38 hours and keeps going at 38 hours. The least amount of hours I ever got was 22 and it was only one week.&nbsp; It's been hell on my body and mind standing for that long and just in general not being used to a working schedule let alone an unpredictable working schedule where I could work 10 hours one day and 4 hours the next and close one night then have to come in and open the store in the morning. I need to go to bed at a decent time and get up at a decent time on a regular basis... as much as I like sleeping in if I go to bed on time it won't be necessary. I have had chest pains that stop me in my tracks and a toothache that acts up when I eat sugary things or drink something cold... so all the time pretty much! Well it's mainly the really bad pain just when I bite into something sweet and it hits that tooth just right... I am headed toward having the same critical spinal problems as my mom because of the stupid futon we are sleeping on... that will be changed when we move again but for now I just have to deal. 

We are moving to Taylor December first, 2009. Near the kroger on Ecorse and Monroe, the house is on ziegler. It's nice because we will have a decent sized backyard with a little shed. The house is itty bitty but we can make it work for the 6 months or so we are supposed to be living there. 

Chances are Tom will be joining the Army and he'll be doing PT for 3 months before he goes to boot camp, then he'll be in boot camp and MOS training for about 3 months before he gets assigned to a base... hopefully in south carolina. That is happening if he doesn't find a job before we move.

My sister is in florida and has been now for a couple months... right around the time I started working I think. She is coming to visit for a week soon then going to new york to visit our cousin timmy who I have yet to see since 10th grade... I'm not going to get to see him but I'm at peace with that now because I've decided if he's not willing to go out of his way to come see me or even call me why should i even try to go through the huge ordeal of going to see him just to be glared at by his wife... oh yeah and BTW he's not really our cousin he is our mom's best friend's son and they have just been friends with my mom so long they became like family... and my sister and I always had a crush on him when we were younger so... yeah it's weird but his jealous wife has never liked me... of course it made a lot more sense when I talked to him on the phone for 5 hours in 2006 and found out he had wanted to date me but didn't know I returned the feelings and he was afraid of losing my parents respect because I'm 6 years younger than him. So chances are that had been mentioned to her long before I found out. Oh yeah and I don't know if my sister is going to go back to florida after that or what but i'm pretty sure she isn't coming back to michigan until end of october.

My husband got in a car accident with my poor purple plymouth breeze and it's totaled. He got scratched up and was sore for a while but he's okay. Our friend Chuck has been taking me to work all the time anyways but now we don't have a car. The volvo isn't running and we don't know why. Still trying to figure that out.

I was going to quit working by the end of september but now I'm working til October 30th because we are staying at the apartment longer than I thought and Tom has agreed to cooperate and help with potty training keeley. The big bummer is that I probably won't get a chance to make git hoodies as costumes for all four of us let alone just myself but I'll be making money toward a car and filing bankruptcy and just a general cushion."

"event","I was a stay at home mother to my 2 toddlers until 2 months ago when I broke down and took a minimum wage job at a greeting card store. <br /><br />Just over six months ago my husband was laid off permanently from the IT company he had worked for just over a year. It was very sudden, nobody saw it coming including my husband's boss! When he came home early as soon as he walked in the door I knew what had happened...<br /><br />You see, this was not the first time he had been suddenly fired due to downsizing. In fact it has become all too familiar! We have been married 3 and a half years and once a year he has lost a job to downsizing with no warning. That's 3 jobs in 3 years!<br /><br /> When he lost the first job he had another job lined up right away. The second job was harder to deal with losing and we went 3 months with no unemployment or anything except for family help and food assistance(which does not cover diapers or formula BTW)while my daughter was still a newborn. Our car got repossessed and we got evicted from our apartment... we were fortunate enough to have family who could lend us the money to move to a cheaper apartment near a promising job opportunity(which happens to be the job he just lost). Then he got the IT job because his brother worked there and got him an interview. Before we had struggled even when he was working so when he got his IT job(a salary job) we finally had a stable paycheck. The loss of this stability that I had finally grown accustomed to just weeks before he was let go... well let's just say I wasn't calm when he came home early telling me he lost his job.<br /><br />We have now been on unemployment and food assistance for over 6 months. We had been driving an 89 volvo until it slowly started having more and more problems with it. We found a car for $500 that ran well and needed minor fixes and got 38 MPG so we jumped on the opportunity. It did have problems that came up but overall nothing that made it not worth the money we paid. I finally had a car I felt safe putting my kids in!<br /><br />So what's the problem? Well 3 days ago my husband made a quick trip to the store and while exiting the parking lot to come back home, a teenager driving with a cast hit him. He totaled both his car and ours... and my husband got the ticket! Nobody was seriously injured but my husband is still pretty sore and a little scraped up too.<br /><br />We haven't got a safe car to drive and my friend has actually had to drive me to work everyday since the accident. If he wasn't unemployed I wouldn't be able to get to work at all. I still have not managed to get my license even though I am 23. I tried to take the test once but failed because of the parallel parking part. Before and after that time we have not had the time to allow me to practice parking, the car to allow me to take the test(volvo won't cut it), or the money to pay for the test.<br /><br />I'm at a loss for things to do right now. One thing after another has made things increasingly depressing and it really hard to stay in high spirits when you can't even take your kids to visit their grandparents 45 minutes away let alone go to the grocery store without asking someone else to take us. PLEASE HELP US!<br /><br /><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/nq7h7n""><strong>Here is a link to the 300 word one where you can vote for me to help toward me getting a free car.</strong></a><br /><br />"

"event","Woohoo!!! I got a job as an entry level manager at American Greetings in Great Lakes Crossing mall. It only pays $8 per hour and it's 15-20 hours per week minimum and I'll get 40 hours per week whenever the manager or assistant manager takes a vacation which the manager told me today that they both have a couple weeks vacation scheduled each that is coming up. YAY!!! Now I have to go shoe shopping for a pair of dress shoes that aren't open toed... hopefully some comfortable heels because when the district manager comes we have to wear heels and I only have uncomfortable open toed heels. I'm just so excited to have a job again and have it not be food service... but the fact that I am starting as a manager in training is excellent too because it gives me better potential for a higher paying job from them or any company hiring a manager in the future."

Little jackie paper loved that rascal puff,
And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff. oh

Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called honah lee.

Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on puffs gigantic tail,
Noble kings and princes would bow wheneer they came,
Pirate ships would lower their flag when puff roared out his name. oh!

Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called honah lee,
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called honah lee.

A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys.
One grey night it happened, jackie paper came no more
And puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.

His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.
Without his life-long friend, puff could not be brave,
So puff that mighty dragon sadly slipped into his cave. oh!

"event","Ok I don't really want a divorce. Right now divorce would mean that I gave up on our marriage and I'm not quite ready to do that. But I feel like he has given up on caring about my feelings until they are already hurt. He seems careless about what he says and makes me feel paranoid everytime i bring up a concern like wanting to take the kids to the doctor or not wanting to use the cry it out method or worrying about starting aiden in preschool in September because of the swine flu going around. It's like he always has to be right. The main reason this is such a problem now is because until now I was still developing my own ideas and feeling my way through parenting... now it seems like since I'm developing my strong ideas and not getting any real positive feedback from him I'm starting to realize he's not always as flexible and knowledgeable as he thinks he is. He a;so likes to bring up fun little ideas and present them as if he really wants to make them happen but then gets upset when I start trying to make those ideas happen. Even if I wanted to leave him I couldn't... I'm screwed!! My mom said it just wouldn't work... we couldn't all live together again. So if I left him I'd have no place to go. And i keep going through cycles of wanting to leave but then talking myself down and thinking about the consequences and telling myself we just need to work on it. I feel like I'm becoming my mom. I don't want that to happen. I can;t stand the way my mom acts with my dad and the fact that they barely see each other and they practically live separate lives just living in the same house and sleeping in same bed out of convenience. I may be in an emotionally abusive relationship again... nothing like when i was with dave but still emotionally abusive. I don't know though because being in the relationship could be keeping me blind but I may be looking for flaws because I'm unhappy. And I can't have anyone judge from my journal or conversations on the phone with me because that's biased in my favor of course. And I don't think my neighbor and his friend(Caleb and Chuck) would be the best judge either because they'd probably be afraid to be honest if the weren't biased in either mine or tom's favor. ARG!!!! Tom actually said I should get a sugardaddy and was serious. He said he's okay with it if I get a sugar daddy as long as he buys me a house! LOl"

"event","Okay so I know we are unemployed and our budget is tight. I know I'm supposed to be depressed about this. And I have been. But all of sudden I started coming out of it. It started with me wanting to cook. When I wanted to cook I don';t mean just mac n cheese. I started wanting to cook a full dinner. I started wanting to make healthier foods. That was when I decided to cook for Mark and Jessie and their kids one night and then Rob, carol, and robbie the next night(that ended up not happening but I still wanted to do it) and I just kept wanting to cook. Sure the meals have been simple things like seasoned steak, seasoned chicken, mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and asparagus. It's not much but it's a start. Then yesterday I really knew it was the beginning of a huge change when I made the decision to stay home alone with the kids while Tom went to his dad's. I was planning on going to my mom's but it would have required staying the night and it was more trouble than it's worth... but normally I still would have done it or at least tried to. I just decided it wasn't worth it and I could handle staying home alone no problem. That was a big deal for me... of course om didn't understand how it was such a big deal because sexually things haven't improved drastically yet. I don't know what changed but I'm pretty sure my hormones are regulating finally.

Well I decided that because I'm coming out of the depression stage what could be better than finally getting a family vacation. So I'm still working out whether or not we can do it but we are planning on going to florida(driving) from May 10th, 2009 to May 16th or 17th, 2009. I talked to my aunt and she's thrilled... I hope we can do it but of course when i got the number from my mom and told her why she got upset. ""Who's dime are you doing that on?!"" She just can't let me be an adult and make my own decisions. She can never just be happy with me for me. No she instead has to make me feel guilty about it and ruin the good feeling I have about it. I suppose she's jealous or thinking I'm not responsible but kiss my butt it's my life and just because I'm on assistance doesn't mean I have to be depressed and never spend any money. And she certainly can't talk about spending money when she is always worried about my dad losing his job and then she keeps buying stuff she doesn't need."

"event","Okay so a lot has been going on recently. We looked into some manufactured homes and found the most perfect home that unfortunately has a pending lease on it. We are waiting to see if that falls through because the property manager promised to contact us first if it did. If it doesn't fall through we are just planning to see what becomes available by mid may. I am so excited because it will be much more affordable than I thought and standard at this place they have 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, washer and dryer and all appliances included and the square footage is 1,100 minimum. These are rent to own so we wouldn't be just throwing our money away anymore and it looks like they all have sheds too. Some have fireplaces and jacuzzi tubs and large kitchens and dining rooms like the one we fell in love with. I am working on figuring out the paint colors and stuff with the one we love in mind and figuring if need be I'll adapt it from there.

Mark and Jessie, our friends with the kids the same age as our kids, are moving this weekend. I am watching the kids for them and they are all going to have their first sleepover here saturday night. Am I crazy? maybe but Aiden and Skylar will probably fall asleep together they way they have been lately. They are always asking to go see each other and Aiden even cried when he had to get off the phone with him and go to bed! They can both clearly say each other's names. I call it their little bromance. LOL

The kids finished their ear infection meds last night and hopefully it cleared up the infection... I need to make a follow up appointment for next friday.

"event","Okay so my car is purple... for once my color blind husband was right. I love it and I just sat in it for the first time today. Didn't start it or anything but I sat in the passenger seat with Keeley and Aiden sat in the driver's seat and tried to honk the horn and turn the steering wheel. And I'm pimping it all put in gir car mats, gir seat covers, and a gir steering wheel cover. I am also going to make an antenna topper of gir out of some sort of ball cuz i hate the flat ones i found and i want to make a 3d one. On top of that I'm getting motivated with a lot of stuff and i have decided to finally make a gir hoodie. I'm starting by making one for keeley, then Aiden, then me, then Tom. My mom sounded weirded out when i told her because i've never been the sewing type but it's because I never had the motivation let alone any real reason to sew. See I loved it in middle school but i didn't really like the patterns and stuff we had... I really want to make gir hoodies and make them look good so that's why I'm starting with Keeley's first... smallest so shortest time to make. I'm actually going to use one of her hoodies that i bought from walmart to design the basic hoodie and go from there. Then once I've made all those I should be good enough to make one for my sister for christmas or her birthday depending on how long it takes me to do all this stuff lol. Oh and we are transferring the plates and insurance from the volvo to my car until the volvo is completely done getting fixed up. Then when i get my own plate for the car I'm getting a personalized plate for it professing my love to gir or expressing one of the many sayings of his I know and love.


<B>Some jokes to brighten your day</B>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A little girl became restless as the preacher's sermon dragged on and on. Finally, she leaned over to her mother and whispered, ""Mommy, if we give him the money now, will he let us go?""




Some ecclesiastical gentlemen -- a cardinal, a couple of bishops and some others -- were waiting outside the Pearly Gates for St. Peter to open up.

He finally arrived, but just they were about to enter heaven St. Peter asked them to wait a moment and let a new arrival through first.

A sweet young thing in a mini-skirt arrived and was ushered through.The cardinal was a bit upset about this and demanded an explanation from St. Peter. After all, they had been waiting outside for quite some time and were pillars of the church. How could a girl in a mini-skirt deserve better treatment?

St. Peter smiled and told him: ""While she was alive, that young lady drove a little yellow sports car. She regularly jumped red lights, overtook on blind corners, and generally scared the devil out of more people than all of you combined."""

"event","Woohoo I have a car i lost my job but i didn't really want it anymore anyways. The kids have an ear infection... Aiden had one and went on antibiotics but it obviously didn't get it all cuz the one ear is still infected but i think it's the one that was really bad and drove his fever up to 103.8 so it makes sense. Keeley has been drilling her ears with her fingers and getting nasty yellow eye boogers and they have both been coughing. So the pediatrician said to give them the antibiotic and come back in three weeks. All the symptoms seem to be from the ear infection he says. And when we take them back they have to get up to date on their shots.

If you could change one thing about your mom, what would it be?

"event","Okay I made this a separate post from the one earlier because it is a totally different subject and train of thought and day. This was on Saturday. See I still have not gotten any playgroup meetings organized and very rarely go to McDonald's play place anymore so when I met my new friends I was so excited. 

We met them in the JET program actually. The girl is the same age as me and is like a little more punk alternative style than I am. Her husband is 29 and you can tell he is older in a lot of ways but he is still really cool and we just hit it off all together. They have a 1 year old girl and 2 year old boy just like us(the 2 year old is actually 2 years and 4 months just like Aiden but born in October instead of early November) And their little girl is chubby like Keeley with blue eyes and their little boy is strong and obsessed with trucks like Aiden with brown eyes too. They have a lot of the same character traits and everything. It's kinda creepy and so cool at the same time. Lucky for them they have more family help because they live closer to them. Unlucky for them they are having problems getting approval for unemployment and their grandma is their landlord and she is kicking them out for only being able to make partial payments. I want to help but I can't do anything. We are stuck here until may and then we are thinking about moving to Westland to be closer to my parents or hopefully possibly getting this rent to own house just down the street from my BIL's house. The rent to own house is a house we wanted to buy and fix up because it is a 6 bedroom house! If we could get that maybe we could help them out but we need a job first too.

Well anyways, they came over with their kids on Saturday. The kids were really shy at first... all of them not just their kids ours too. Keeley was hiding behind the bins by our bookcase and peeking around them at the kids then whipping behind the bins again. She took a while to come out by me then wanted in my lap but I told her no. Eventually they stood just out of reach both offering the other a toy(Keeley and Brooke their little girl were doing this I mean) neither wanted to be the first to accept the toy. Before long they were running around playing like crazy. Aiden and the little boy Skylar hit it off pretty quick because they both love trucks and Skylar went right for the truck box and soon dumped it so they were off and running around with trucks while the girls were still unsure of everything. Everything went great. We put the girls in the high chairs and set up the kids folding table with the two kids folding chairs in front of the tv on the puzzle mat. They ate chicken nuggets for dinner and we got Pizza. I went out to get pizza and took forever because I wanted to get chili fries for myself and the family restaurant next to pizza hut had tomato chili not bean chili. There were two coney island restaurants I tried next door to each other but they were both closed. I was going to try the next family restaurant I saw but I decided to just go to Ram's Horn rather than striking out again and having to go there anyways. They charge over $5 for 2 cups of chili when I only asked for one and I just wasn't really thinking about it because I was trying to hurry up and get back with the pizza by then. I was heading back and realized I forgot to get the pop for our guests so I stopped at Kroger and ended up getting 3 2 liters of coke products because they were the only ones that were on sale that I saw at a glance so I got Sprite, Fanta orange, and regular coke for $4. Then I finally got home and of course they were worried and asked if I got pulled over and even asked if I was lying when I said no because I still don't have my license. The kids had eaten but Caleb was there when I got back and none of us adults had eaten. So we sat down and ate and the kids each were given a piece of pizza but they wanted more chicken nuggets so I had to make those. Then I ran to the bathroom and when I got out Keeley needed changing. I was going to do it but Jessie(the mother who is looking for a daycare job) said don't worry I'll do it go ahead and eat even though Keeley was thoroughly poopy. I sat down to eat and got attacked by a very tired whiny demanding Aiden wanting my fries and then Keeley wanting my corn and Brooke came over and started eating my corn too. So at least I still got most of my fries and all of my chicken strips. Tom ended up eating my salad later on though of course:( but it didn't look as good as I had hoped so whatever... at least Tom ate some greens which is a miracle cuz he never does and usually hates the idea of salad but he said it sounded good. Well the whole day went great and Aiden didn't have any accidents that I know of(tom got him ready for bed so I don't know if he was wet or anything but he probably would have told me if he was) and the kids just loved the whole day and were very tired by the time they left. The only bad thing was that Brooke was in the kids room with the boys and they closed the door and nobody except Jessie who was in the bathroom could hear her screaming... which is weird because I always hear that stuff. But I heard her whining a little at the door and jumped up running down the hall to find her just on the other side of the door with a huge bump on her head. I thought she had a mark on her head on that bump and that was it... like something rubbed off on her but she had a huge goose egg on her head and a line in the middle of it that was actually a bad bruise. It looked like she had to have hit her head on the side of the door as the boys were trying to close it or something. I felt terrible and I know these things happen and she wasn't even upset or crying and didn't even act like it hurt her anymore. I just felt so bad and tried to get her to let any one of us put ice on it(an ice pack wrapped in a burp cloth) but we all tried and she refused. The just said they'd take her home and give her Motrin for the pain and swelling and she'd be fine. I really hope she is okay... I'm sure she is but I just never saw a kid her age get such a bad bump or bruise on their head like that. I was worried about a concussion later when I thought about it but she seemed fine... I just hope she really was. They don't have a phone right now because they just had a virgin mobile phone and couldn't afford the minutes. We will see them in the JET program in the morning so I can ask but my mind keeps going to the worst case scenario like she got a concussion her brain swelled and she died in her sleep. If they don't show up tomorrow I will be freaking out for sure. This is not a program you miss for no reason. Mark is her husband and he missed because of an asthma attack but aside from that or a job interview you have to be there or risk losing your assistance.

I'm sure they'll be there and we will laugh it off later but right now I'm calmly panicking... Well I'm tired and my mind hates me for being up and it's going over and over is Brooke okay of course she's okay what are you crazy but what if she isnt what the hell am i gonna say and id feel like it was my fault and omg i could be the reason their daughter dies... etc etc I know it's all crazy crap but it's what is going through my head. I sure hope they are there tomorrow... I better try to go to bed since I have to wake up with the kids and call daycare and tom has to get their stuff together while I call and we need to get them there by 7:30am so they have some free time to play with the kids before free play ends at 8am plus I have some questions and maybe some things the finish on the paperwork too. night all

Oh yeah and Jessie might be driving me to my mom's to go to Karaoke for my mom's birthday. As in we would all be going to karaoke together! YAY! And the boys will be hanging out playing video games together and watching the kids. Woo hoo friends for me, tom, and the kids!"

"event","I am so overwhelmed with the kids when Tom isn't home I was beginning to think about going back to work because I just couldn't handle it anymore. But I don't want my kids to be raised by daycare if I can help it. So we decided to try putting the kids in daycare 2 full days a week to give me a break... let me sleep in catch up on housework and just relax... if I can allow myself to even do that. Well that is this will all go into affect after Tom gets a job. One way or another I still plan to apply for a couple phone sex operator jobs and work on weekends if it is a shift oriented one or a couple hours a night if it is just a work when you have the time kind of one. That could pay for the daycare and give us extra money for savings and pocket money. It is an exciting idea at the very least. I'm certain the kids will love it because I know they really like being around other kids but don't get to enough. They might sleep better in general too because they would be more active with the whole being around so many other kids and Aiden will even be in school! We have to do the daycare while we are in the JET program because otherwise we will never get the hours in that we need and we could and, according to notices, would lose our assistance because of not complying with the program. Our assistance starts Monday so we have four weeks of the JET program after that and then if we still don't have a job we have to do community service. I'm worried about getting a job but hopefully tom will have a job by Monday because the last interview he went to said they'd notify him by then basically and he was the only one they interviewed that was not way over qualified. The other people had certifications that would qualify them to make $200,000 per year and this job only offers up to $55,000. So even though they may be willing to settle for 55,000 the employer looks at that and worries that they may find a better job and just up and leave... so Tom should get the job no problem. They may be taking longer to decide though because we really thought we'd hear something by Friday when they were supposed to have made the decision because they wanted someone to start Monday.

I'm going to try to get a part time job so the kids can be in daycare but not be raised by daycare. Then I'll be getting out of the house without spending money and I'll actually be making money. Not making money the past three years has really bothered me. So I could make enough money to cover daycare and hopefully have some left over as spending money as long as Tom gets a job too.

I worry that the JET program may work quicker for me than for him because I'm looking for something lower paying and entry level stuff. I'm looking into becoming an editor because I am just not ready or business savvy enough to do the online Typo Police company yet. Every time I think about finishing the site, and getting all the legalities worked out, I get so overwhelmed and never get started on it even. I want to become an editor for Red Dress Ink but their editors are more like promoters of the authors. They find the authors and organize the illustrations and get the author to do the editing! No wonder they have so many mistakes! I want to suggest to them that they create a new editing position simply for actually editing all the books that haven't yet been published. I mean the errors in these books are freaking horrible and so obvious to me that I can skim the book and find at least one if not three or more errors on every page! I love the content but really... they need to do something about these errors! I want to be the one to fix their books and I am tempted to go through the books I have and circle all the errors in red then send them one book a month with a note saying ""I love your books but please let me edit them. Here is an example of the errors I can find easily and I would love to correct them if you hire me.:)-sincerely Megan G.""
and then ""P.S. Here is a copy of my resume for your review."" The JET Program has helped me create an awesome editor's resume that reminds me of how the back of a book looks.

I am seriously tempted to do it but I don't know where to send them because E-Harlequin is the main company and Red Dress Ink is just a division of the company... Does anyone think this could work? I really doubt they'd even pay attention... but maybe they would? I mean as a publisher seeing one of your most popular publishing company's books being sent back to you after being read(obvious by fanned pages and then even more so when they see the ink in the book.) wouldn't you be curious? But would curiosity be enough to make them hire me?"

"event","I'm spending my valentine's wishing my hubby was home right now... he's at his brother's house around the corner helping his dad fix his car. And for all I know he won't be back until after dark because I can't get a hold of anyone since they aren't answering their phones. Hubby is unemployed and we are trying to save as much money as possible so we can't go anywhere, buy anything, do anything. Heck I thought valentine's day was sunday until yesterday and hubby had completely forgotten about valentine's day all together even though a couple days ago we talked about how it would be on the 14th... he obviously wasn't paying attention to the date.

I told him it's valentine's day and he went oh i didn't know that... but he didn't say hey happy valentine's day or anything... He said he isn't feeling good and slept in today... as usual. He said if he feels better tomorrow he'll wake up with the kids. Funny... I feel like absolute crap but that doesn't matter I am the SAHM so I have to wake up with the kids no matter what and on occasion he does me the favor of waking up with the kids and expects an award from it practically. ERG!!! I swear I just am gonna be going to bed after I put the kids down at 7pm. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day but I'm not counting on it... no day is good lately and today being valentine's day just makes me think of just how sucky things have been. I always thought that having a valentine would make me love valentine's day but instead it just makes me feel more like crap about my hubby's lack of romance and general lack of effort. Sorry I'm complaining over nothing... Hope nobody else is having a day like mine."

"event","I don't feel important... I don't feel like people will remember me when I'm gone... I mean sure my kids but they can't help remembering me. I feel like a burden to my husband... nd an annoyance to my family and friends. I need everyone so much more than they need me. Heck I even feel like I need my kids more than they need me. And here I am bored and depressed and feeling sorry myself... so pathetic. I need to get over myself. I owe it to my kids and my husband to just shut up and be good... at least that's the way I'm starting to feel. We haven't been to counseling because we have to have someone watch the kids and well that's never going to happen... it never does. My mom probably would but she had her hand surgery so she can't for another couple of weeks at least. 

I talked to tom and asked him to only go to rob's after the kids go to bed and he agreed on that though he wasn't happy. But then today during the kids nap his dad called saying he was at rob's and needed help with his car. So he went over to help. I am glad he's willing to help people. I'm just pissed that his dad basically assumes that Tom never has anything better to do so he just calls the exact moment he wants him to come over instead of calling and asking ahead of time. He's taking him for granted and in the process causing tom to do the same to me. Maybe that's not the reality but that's how i see it.

At this point i really feel like the only way I can make anyone else happy is to completely ignore myself. And that's why I'm depressed because no matter how nice and selfless I try to be I can't ignore my own needs and still be happy. I'm not tired but I seriously want to just crawl in bed and cry myself to sleep right now. And i don't want to have to get up for a very long time either. But I have no control in my life these days and I'm not lucky enough to be able to do anything for myself more than once a month because my mom is the only one I can count on being able to go out with without the kids.

I'm supposed to hang out with Jon tomorrow night but he's so busy with work that I haven't heard from him since night before last and even then it was a short conversation and he was at the store and maybe he didn't say eh had to go and thought I hung up on him but I swore he said he was going to call me back because he was at the store. I feel like such a pest calling him and all but I'm jus trying to figure out if he and I are still on for saturday night and I'm only calling him once a day. But maybe that's unreasonable. i would just come out and ask him but I can't because that would require getting a hold of him or catching him online.

I just wish someone could make me feel important again... And I wish Tom would read this so he would understand why I'm so upset today and maybe do something about it but he refuses to read my journal. He said he was going to read my post about religion but he still hasn't. I haven't bothered to remind him because I'm tired of having to be the one to remember everything important in this household when I have such a bad memory.

Oh god this is going to be such a long day... Aiden already got my liquid eye liner and covered himself and painted keeley's nose when I first started typing this. So obviously they need a bath tonight when I have no help.

I swear I can't even handle the kids anymore. What good am I?!"

My husband saw a memo in a newspaper about V day while he was at work. Being the forgetful guy he is he thought OMG I forgot it's valentine's day! So he asked his friend at work what he got his wife and got him all panicked thinking he forgot. They went out to buy cards at lunch and couldn't find anything so they thought they were all sold out! So his friend buys his wife a ton of chocolates and teddy bears and roses(stuff that you can still find year round) on the way home. My hubby knew we couldn't afford a last minute purchase on valentine's day so he was driving home thinking he was going to have to disappoint me and tell me he forgot. But then he hears them talking about VETRAN'S DAY on the radio and realizes he was wrong. Unfortunately for his friend he couldn't warn him soon enough. He got a call from his friend and he was freaking out like hey what the hell you got me in trouble! She thinks i did something wrong now cuz I brought her all this stuff home! LOL This is what guys get for not even paying attention to the month that romantic holidays are in. IT WAS FALL!!! LOL... or... at least i think vetrans day is in september... LOL this could get ME in trouble...

"event","Keeley woke up at 4 am panicking and wouldn't calm down unless we held her and rocked her constantly. So I had to bring her to bed with me because tom asked her if she wanted to sleep with mommy and she giggled and took off running for our room. I never cosleep with my kids... for a good reason I don't get much sleep and neither do they that way. Plus tom slept on the couch cuz our bed is not big enough for a baby flopping around with 2 adults. So I spent the time from 4am until 7:30am getting kicked and rolled on and of course I started feeling like I needed to move so I woke her up a lot and well... I am so ready for nap time... cant wait for it to get here. I'm sure she'll pass out for nap time quite easily too. I can hope so at least. Part of me feeling like I needed to move is this weird restless leg syndrome feeling. But not in my legs... in my arms and hands and fingers. Sometimes in my feet and occassionally in my legs... but mainly arms. I only seem to have that problem when I don't get enough sleep. It's a very uncomfortable annoying feeling like an itch on the inside of your chest that comes from heartburn. You can't medicate the heartburn(metaphor for the lack of sleep) so you can't get rid of the itch but you also can't scratch it. So you squirm around until it goes away. Well I had the restless leg syndrome feeling in my hands all day yesterday... I need to get the over the counter meds for this cuz it makes me mad and I just want to scream because it won't go away. My cousin has the same thing occasionally so she recomended i get the meds because she said they work really well. I'm trying not to spend money but this is something I need to keep my sanity. My hand is still feeling that way now... I'm gonna go see about getting the meds before I blow up for no apparent reason other than this uncomfortable feeling...ARG!!!"

"event","I didn't want to get up this morning. Once i got up I stayed up til 10:30 doing as little as possible because Iw as so tired. But suddenly i got a boost of motivation and started cleaning up the front room. I started with Aiden's cars that he had dumped out of the box... they were all over the floor because he actually emptied the box. As I was scooping the trucks in the box Aiden got out of his high chair and came up behind me. When he saw what i was doing I thought for sure he was going to get upset but instead he got excited. I merely suggested he help me put away his trucks and he immediately started picking them up and putting them in the box. I crawled around finding more and tossing them by him and he would pick them up and put them in the box. I went all the way over in front of the TV from by Tom's computer and he followed me but when I found at least 3 trucks I would hand them to him and he would take them over and put them in the box. He was doing so good and keeley even started helping me put the other toys in the little cabinet in the middle of the dresser under the tv. I even managed to get aiden to walk into his room and get in bed on his own for his nap. My nap didn't go so well. I felt like I barely got to sleep and I asked Tom to please get up with them because he had slept in and hadn't been up yet. I just wanted to sleep all day but I only asked for him to let me sleep until 2pm. He did and almost immediately left for his brother rob's house. No idea when he'd be home but he said he'd try to be back before the kids were supposed to be in bed. That was aggravating because normally that means no way would he make it back before they went to bed.

Well Caleb called an hour or so later needing tom to come jump his mom's car. At that point I was getting the kids dressed and ready to go on a walk. I needed tom to put the front wheel back on the jogging stroller so it worked out perfect because he was back just in time to help caleb and me too. So I walked out the door telling tom I was going to mcdonald's and he said ""that's kind of a far walk"" I said it's only around the block. Well a block here is more like 2 miles. So I did end up going after making a loop back to the apartment for the diapers and wipes i had forgotten to bring due to the last minute decision to do more than just walk around and back to the apartment. It was not an easy walk but I still enjoyed it because it wasn't a cake walk. I did plenty of manuevering about with the stroller that needs to be half lifted to make any real turns. Plus the many snow piles that survived the 50+ degree weather... It was exercise... not a horrible workout but still exercise. I'm just so proud that I made myself get out and I went that far despite being so tired and not even wanting to get up at 2pm. The kids seemed to have a lot of fun and I'm sure they loved the chicken nuggets and lunchmakers(that I intentionally brought in case they didn't want the nuggets or needed more than what I bought.) and the baby ice cream cones i got them. Keeley made a new friend named bella and helped me make friends with her mom jasmine. We exchanged numbers by her suggestion not mine. I held off just a little and she said we could exchange numbers before I did so it was nice that she initiated it instead of me. Bella is 1 and her other child is a 6 year old boy. She is 26 so not horribly older than me. She seems just so nice I'm excited I might be able to really hang out with her.:)

Tom picked us up and took us home with the stroller hanging out of the trunk a little bit.  The kids were thoroughly tired and after changing them and putting them in bed they layed there while we turned off the light and didn't even cry at all. They talked to each other a little bit but no crying at all. The fresh air and then the exercise really got to them. Thank goodness. I am thoroughly calmed by the exercise I got today but not tired out. Just planning on going to bed at a reasonable time for once tonight... If I don;t jump the hubby because I did jump him last night and I really enjoyed myself but I could have kept going... unfortunately he couldnt because I was enjoying myself so much lol. I told him I was going to jump him in the morning but as usual i was too tired. I'm feeling a lot more alive now that I'm getting out and exercising and spending quality time with tom. We watched the bucket list last night and wanted tonight. It is just nice to sit and watch something new together... But now I have to go fetch tom from caleb's house cuz he went to have a ciggarette and he always gets mesmerized by some video game over there lol."

Don't worry I'm not going to kill myself. I love my kids too much to ever even think about that.

But I certainly can't promise I won't go numb. I need to get Tom into the psychologist with me this saturday. I just keep getting more and more confused by what she thinks I need to do.

Here I am trying to write in my journal while the kids are awake. Tom went to his brother's house to watch the super bowl and  am on the verge of tears. Every little thing the kids do is just too much for me to handle right now. But I couldn't make him stay home. I have to let him go or I'll suffocate him and make him resent me. And I love him and my children and I want our relationship to work. I don't want to end up separated or divorced. And at the same time I don't want to be miserable anymore.

I'm so lonely and I feel like running away... with the kids of course. But then I'm torn on that thought too because I don't want the kids to be apart from their dad and caught in the middle of a stupid fight between us.

I'm crying now and it breaks my heart to know I am hurting my kids when I do this. Aiden just walked up in front of me and asked ""what's wrong mommy?"" I just told him ""mommy doesn't feel good"" and then I asked him to come give me a hug and he crawled up on the couch and very gently gave me a hug and held on until I let go. How can I be so upset? I have a wonderful loving son and daughter. My husband loves me and I know it... but I just don't feel it right now. I feel like all I do is stress him out and all he wants from me is physical stuff. Which I don't really remember when we last did anything and normally I would have given in and done something for him but right now I certainly don't feel like he deserves it. And yet I can't blame him. He doesn't know what to do and I don't know what to tell him to do. I am just so confused and lonely.

Last nigth he went to a movie with caleb and chuck probably around 10 or 11pm. I was in bed by 9 so he came in and asked me if I minded if he went to the movie. I said no I don't mind go. And I didn't really care for once. But I thought he was going to the movie and pretty much just coming home after. Instead I woke up at 2am and nobody was home but me and the kids still. I couldn't find the phone so I knew he had to have it. I tried text messaging my phone from my computer but yahoo doesn't support that for metropcs and the service that i happened to find that does it for free said it sent the messages but they never got to my phone at all as i found out later. I figured they were over at Caleb's or at the very least I could use their phone to call him if not. Well turns out he was over there and caleb and chuck were watching him play a game. He had just completely forgotten that he took the phone with him but figured it wasn't a problem because I was sleeping and had gone to bed early enough to get up with the kids no problem. I stayed over there for like 2 hours while he played the video game the whole time. I finally went home and took a shower and went to bed after he said he was just going to stay up all night. Which kinda ticked me off because it's not like I would ever be able to decide something like that spontaneously. So when i was still tired and Tom walked in the door at 7am and the kids were just waking up I asked him if he would stay up with the kids and let me sleep in. He said that was fine and he let me sleep. I slept until 11am and beyond because then he came in to the bedroom and had already put keeley to sleep in the front room. I layed awake staring at the wall most of the time. Then an hour after I fell asleep again Keeley woke up. Aiden got up a half hour later. Tom didn't get up until about 5:30pm and he had already planned to go to the superbowl party at  my BIL's house at 6pm. I know he spent the first half of the day with the kids but it pissed me off that he needed to be asked to get up even then to see the kids before he left.

The scary thing is that all of this is exactly the way my parents were and still are. I would have divorced my dad by now if I was in my mom's shoes. So I need to get Tom to see the problem before it gets worse. I can't ignore the fact that he said "" yeah I'll go to the psychologist with you but I don't see why I have to go when it's you that has the problem."""

"event","Went to the assistance office today. Got the application filled out and waited to get in and see the caseworker. Got in about noon and of course that was right when tom went out for a cigarette and to move the car. So I went back and got everything set up by myself. It's weird... I used to be so devoid of skills in anything... so clingy and unable to function in the real world because I was so clueless. After marrying Tom it's not like he never does anything but he makes me do things whether I know how or not and I learn. I now feel like I can do most anything even if I don't know how. I feel like I can learn it no matter what. I'm more willing to just dive in and ask questions and do stuff instead of worrying so much about whether or not I will be able to handle it. Like Nike says ""Just do it"". Now I'm not perfect... I have yet to conquer my fear of taking my driving test to get a license... no idea why I can't get over it but I just don't seem to be able to. To some extent it's procrastination problem but I wouldn't be procrastinating so much if it weren't so scary to me."

"event","I am missing my faithful days. I miss when I used to give my heart to jesus every day that I went ot church. When I got myself up to go to church and walked there by myself because it was just around the block and my dad had stopped going because my sister stopped going. Now those are different times... The latter was before my crisis of faith when I outright told my dad that I wasn't sure I believed in god anymore. I think that hurt him because we had moved but continued to go to the same church on the opposite end of dearborn. So my dad had started going to church again obviously. He got upset and said ""fine if you aren't going to church anymore then neither am I"". And the first reference was when I was in momentum and sure I was the only one in the group that believed in god that wasn't a leader as I found out later... but even though everyone said I was so inspiring and faithful... I was dating dave through part of the end of the momentum time I believe... but I may have my times mixed up. Anyways, I was no angel or saint. I was sinful. But I believed in god. Over time I started realizing that the bible wasn't for me because I didn't believe that I was sinful or bad for the things I had done like sex before marriage. I became a diest in probably 11th grade or so I believe. Basically I believed in a higher power or entity but not necessarily god and I had my own ideas about other things and didn't follow the bible. I continued to go to various churches. Taking the initiative to walk to them myself a lot of times because I was going alone. But I always found church to be a very judgmental place. I went to a church that I loved but the people my age or younger were all sitting in a group in the back pews and glaring holes in my head because I liked sitting up front. I also was not very accepted in the fact that I carried my stuffed animal stitch with me. I know that's weird but the only reason people talked to me besides the pastor was because I already knew another member andrew z from school. I really enjoyed the activities and such with that church. But at the same time they made me uncomfortable a lot too. I did feel sinful because of being sexually active when I was at that church. Not so much because I believed it was wrong but because they believed it and made me feel that way. I did not believe it was something to repent for and that was the only solution in their beliefs so it didn't work for me. I burst out crying at a get together at the pastor's house I believe it was. Everyone was in the backyard playing volleyball and I was having fun and participating and then the opposite team's spiker spiked the ball full force in one of those hits that they have to jump up for and they usually make the sand fly when they land that on beach courts... well the person spiked it into my forehead. I had watery eyes but I wasn't crying or anything even though I might have cried a little bit after from the throbbing in my head. Well as much as I wanted to keep playing after my team actually recovered the ball ricocheting off my head and still got the point... I was advised to sit down and after being hit that hard I kinda had to agree. I sat down in a lawn chair and had ice on my head. At some point I got cold as it was getting dark and I just bundled up in a blanket watching everyone else around me having fun. I really liked these people and liked the energy. Then I just burrowed into the blanket and started sobbing wanting someone to talk to but not really wanting anyone to notice. That was because I was worried about having an STD at the time and I really didn't want to be judged or consoled with prayers and repenting. Sammy(like a little brother to me since we met up again in 9th grade after not seeing each other since grade school) was the first to notice me hiding so he tried to get me to look up knowing I had to be crying. 4 years of close friendship.. he knew me. I don't think he knew the reason at the time but he knew I wasn't ok. The pastor's wife ended up pulling me aside to get me to talk and I wanted to but didn't at the same time. I hope that makes sense. Well she got it out of me that I was worried about an STD and she of course consoled me with prayers and telling me to let jesus into my heart. I prayed with her and all that and I felt a little better but more because I knew she thought I was a better person and wasn't as likely to be judging me thinking I was repenting. I still felt uncomfortable the whole time though after that because I knew I was lieing to her and I wasn't going to stop having sex. I think it may have been just because it was my only control in my life even though ironically it was out of control because it was unprotected, I worried about pregnancy all the time, my bf was an ass hole, my bf was a repeating cheater(4 times in 3 years to be exact... well not at that time but that's what it all came to amount to when we were through), STDs were a big worry, and I didn't even really enjoy it either... it was all about him. I continued going to that church for a while but I just felt too uncomfortable with everything after a while. It also didn't help that I found out it was a common belief in that church that homosexuality was a disease that could be and needed to be cured.

Since that last church I really haven't tried to find another church. I think about being christian and it is a good feeling when you go to christian concerts and get caught up in the atmosphere and know the songs. It's like a natural drug. But I can't be a christian just because of that. And yes I believe in a higher power and the general idea of love your neighbor. I believe it's great to have a community to be part of like that. But I am not faithful because my beliefs do not include the bible, jesus, calling a higher power god, and believing that he controls my life and I cn rely on him. I mean I think about christianity because I feel stupid when I say to someone I'll be hoping for you in order to avoid saying praying because I don't want to give the wrong impression. I just believe in the positive energy of keeping someone in your thoughts. Sounds like wicca right? Wrong. I am not a goddess and do not believe in a lot of the spells and things that go with wicca. I do not believe someone with permanent nerve damage in their knee in chronic pain can be healed by a chain of positive thinkers channeling their energy into the painful area. I don't believe in anything solidly. and some might say that's why I'm lost.

And to some extent I feel that way too... but I don't want to become part of a religion or label myself as anything because I like the generality(don't think that's a word but I want to use it) of having these ideas but not picking a religion because religions are lebeled with stereotypes and I'm far from fitting one so I wouldn't want to say ""I'm christian"" or whatever religion to help people define me because they wouldn't be even close to defining me.

Here's what I believe.

I believe in the effects of negative and positive energy and moods on people and things around us. Not to an extreme of healing or anything but certainly making things slightly better or worse.

I believe their may be a higher power... but that power to me could just be the forces of the universe that we so fondly claim to understand somewhat in science but we really know nothing. And why can't that amazing thing called the universe be enough of a higher power? It controls us to some extent. It deeply effects our lives for better and worse. Why does there have to be a god? I'd say god is more of a personification of the universe and things we don't understand because talking and praying to god sounds a lot less crazy then talking and praying to the universe.

I believe that everything happens for a reason.

I believe we have destinies but not quite. We have preset destinies but it's like a map... there are forks in the road. Like you come to a fork in the road and there are 3 choices. Each choice leads to a set destiny. So it's not really destiny but just following the whole everything happens for a reason and cause and effect theory. Now I'm not sure if I believe that those choices are set there but because everything happens for a reason you are doomed or destined to take only one of them and therefore making the other choices pointless for anything but distraction because you were never really going to pick them anyways. Confusing i know... it's hard to sort it out but basically if the other choices are pointless it brings it down to destiny again because you are destined to make the one choice all along and every choice along the road would be something you were destined to do. I don't know if I like the idea of destiny because it takes away all control and you can never change anything that is supposed to happen because you are destined to do it one way and one way only... but I think I kinda believe it is that way whether i like it or not. I get deja vu dreams a lot. Like I dream something in first person... it's so realistic that when I wake up it takes me a second to adjust and realize it was a dream and I'm not still in it. It is usually just something weird and unimportant and I forget that little clip of my dreams until it's happening and I do it all as I remember that it happened before. I can never stop myself from doing everything exactly as it happened in the dream even as I think wait I know what's going to happen. But because it is never important it's okay that I can't change it... it's just a very weird experience to know some little tidbit of your life a month ahead of time and not even realize what dream will be deja vu until it's happening and I'm feeling like hey this happened before. So far I haven't found it to definitely mean anything... but I think it tends to lead up to big changes in my life... it's hard to figure out because it is so random and my memory is so bad. The problem is if I'm right the big changes are never the dreams and they are never good. Like tom losing his job, or previously my aunt dieing... The deja vu is typically paired with a constant sighting of 2s i particularly see 2:22am on the clock in the morning. I wake up for no apparent reason and look at the clock just to see 2:22am. That was happening recently... then it stopped just before Tom lost his job. It pisses me off because if all this is supposed to warn me about bad stuff then why couldn't it be more like hey this day and time. But no the time sighting stopped days before he lost his job... maybe it stopped the night his boss found out about having to fire so many people that friday... can't remember exactly when it stopped. But he got fired monday so it would have been nice to have it stop the night before so I could brace myself or something. Just wish I could do something.. make this weird phenomenon useful.

Other than that I believe in ghosts or spirits haunting us sometimes due to my own experiences with such things. And the golden rule of do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Do I necessarily practice it so much? Not as saintly as I'd like to but it is general to me because sometimes I just believe certain people*cough cough* three years ex bf who screws everyones lives up and is a general drain on society and the world simply by existing and being him*cough cough* really do deserve to get what's coming to them and I sometimes wish I had the guts to give them what they deserve myself.

Well that was a lot of venting of my ideas and stuff... I just feel a little lost like I wish I had it in me to be religious. All this was really brought on by this book I'm reading called ""Diary of a teenage girl My name is chloe"" that's all written as a teen girl's diary as she is starting high school and struggling between wicca and christianity. She reminds me a lot of myself but I just got to the part where she accepts jesus into her heart and I had to put it down because it made me uncomfortable and I just had to write out my thoughts.

I almost think being christian is worth the positive energy but it comes with too much negativity too. Plus I don't want to do something just because I started reading about christianity again. I'm not so weak minded that I need to become christian because this book makes good points and sounds good. So why do I feel so in need of religion? I'm not one to do something because everyone else does it. But I don't want to avoid doing something just because everyone else does it either. I like being myself and highly pride myself on being so true to me. So why do I feel like I'm not being myself by not being a christian? I mean I don't have christian beliefs... how would it make sense? I mean sure i miss the community aspect of it but it seems like more than that. Like I don't mind believing in stuff and claiming myself as christian if ever I am asked. But I would also never be a christian to convert or say hey these are my beliefs do you believe them and try to argue my point with someone about it. I'm more likely to be the type to ask lots of questions in person one on one with the pastor after church if I go to church in this hypothetical world. I would also be one to pray in the closet or just in general never in front of anyone or out loud... probably not even folding my hands. And just in general be a very introverted christian that still says bless you without the god when soemone sneezes, and never tells anyone that god is the answer and will solve your problems if you just accept him and ask him to, or even mentioning god in discussions. I never was that way but that was because I had such solid undeniable beliefs and was a lot happier of a person then. My personality has drastically changed. Heck another LJ user that I was best friends with for 6 years and recently started talking to again could tell anyone how drastically I changed just compared between 11th and 12th grade. I've narrowed it down to that probably being when my depression started.

I used to be that happy ray of sunshine person. Bouncy and beaming even at 5am even though I wasn't a morning person. I was that person a lot of people hate just because they are so happy. I was also naive. And my happiness, innocence, and naive ways were shattered by 3 years that I chose to spend in love with the worst person I ever could have been with... well actually it could have been worse I admit. But it was a real eye opener and an emotionally abusive relationship that though I still look back on negatively it taught me a lot and made me who I am. I like who I am for the most part and I wouldn't change those 3 years because that would change me. So I really need to forgive and forget. But though I would forgive him I can't because I know about the new wife and child he has and he hasn't changed. So due to that he is unforgiven because he has not changed himself even though he knows how horrible of a person he is being and has been. And I will never forget because I believe a wise person forgives but doesn't forget. and I certainly don't want to ever repeat that history if somehow I was ever given the chance.

Wow this is a heavy post... and to think all because I started reading again. I haven't read any books since I was pregnant with keeley and even then it was only one toward the end of my pregnancy and it had been since just after Aiden was born before that that I had ever actually really read and especially finished a book.

I feel like crap physically and I'm tired but the reading and this post has helped me feel better because i feel like me again. I feel like I'm truly expressing myself as an indiviual not just a mother and a wife. This is what I need. Talking honestly and openly about everything with tom, reading, writing long personal posts in my journal, making new friends, and just in general improving myself, my life, and same with my family and their life. Well I better go cuz my side is cramping like I'm having contractions... and as far I know I'm not pregnant and I'm not on my period so I'm going to see if I can take a shower and sleep.
Tomorrow at 7:30am it is time to take off for the assistance office. BIL is watching the kids for us and I might talk tom into each getting a donut on the way back and sitting down to talk just so we have some alone tme together and out of the house. ttyl... hoping this wasn't to long and confusing.

Oh and my next book to tackle is going to be barcode tattoo so expect a long entry on the days I read that too because it's a furturistic thing where they use barcode tattoos instead credit cards and ids and stuff."

"event","Okay so I'm looking into work at home programs more seriously now since Tom lost his job. If I could make enough money working from home then Tom could stay home too. Maybe we could both work from home. I'm thinking about taking a job with Ameriplan because there is a mom in one of my work at home groups on cafemom that is constantly talking about it and it sounds like a great opportunity. Main thing I don't like is that it is selling insurance basically... at least that's what I gather from it so far. So it's based on comission and referrals. For the time being I am still doing my survey sites trying to make some money to add to our bank account... it just doesn't add enough... The best site I have used so far I have earned $30 a month on easily but it's so time consuming that's all I could find the time to get done that actually credited. About $20 is pending and has been for a month.

I was thinking about offering my services to websites as a spell checker and generally to fix the mistakes that tend to invalidate the site and make the creator look unintelligent for the simple mistakes that haven't been edited out of the content. I was thinking about that before he lost his job but now I'm really thinking that I should setup a website to promote that idea. My biggest problem is always finding who to contact when I find a website that desperately needs correction. I mean customer service is not who I would need to talk to and it's not like most websites give you contact info for their webmaster. I also don't know what to charge. I never felt like anyone would take me seriously because I'm not an english major or anything. But I figure if I create my own website and make sure it has no errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation and such it might actually work. I think I am gong to go start on that now... ttyl all"

"event","I went to my psychologist appointment earlier today obviously and she wants me to get Tom to come in with me. She believes my depression is from the fact that I am losing myself... I am a wife and a mother and just going through the motions with no place in there for megan... I really felt that way and thought that but I felt stupid thinking it and guilty too because it means I need to get more time to myself which is hard. So I am going to start looking for a baby sitter that I can start out slow with. Like have the person watch the kids to give me a break but have me still be home just not having to take care of the kids. Then maybe after a while I can start to trust them with my kids alone after a while. That and I need a license. Obvious on the license part I know but the more confirmation I get of that needing to happen the more motivated I get to make it happen.

Tom agreed to go but even said he didn't see why we needed to go to marriage counseling seeing as that is what it will be. We are almost up to 3 years married and it seems like we shouldn't be having problems already but we have 2 kids and we are young and are just now getting control of our finances. Maybe he will understand things better after a couple sessions. Now I need someone to watch the kids in order for us to do these sessions together. So regardless I am going to another session next saturday at 2pm. But it may be a bit before we can do sessions together because of needing someone to watch the kids.

He talked to his doctor about his stomach problems today and she gave him nexium. Nope not for heartburn but that's what I thought at first. Just reduces the acid in your stomach so it can help with general stomach problems. In 2 weeks if he is better she is going to prescribe the chantix stop smoking pill to him. I guess a side effect can be stomach problems so she wants to clear that up first before prescribing the chantix to him.

I got my bluetooth headset today. I might be upgrading my phone to something close to a sidekick in the next week too. If so I'll be changing my number because it requires a new activation for the deal so heads up I might be handing out my new number soon.

We might be getting a cat soon. I was shocked when Tom mentioned wanting one. We both loved having a dog and really miss having a pet in general... (I miss my hamster djaquory almost like a child) and because of our credit there's of course always a worry of not being able to move to a dog friendly place or any place at the end of may. So I started looking into adopting a cat from a shelter. I have 2 favorites and have applied for one. The other doesn't have a way to apply online and I want to go see her in ann arbor like now!! she sounds so perfect.

http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=11974172
I applied for this one already

http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=12840419
This is the beautiful cat I want in ann arbor... Is that not the most awesome coloring ever!?

My sister has a kitten though. She is possibly in a situation where she might need to find a home for him so I told her to keep me up to date and I'll try to wait until she knows for sure. If I could have her kitten instead of her finding a random home for him in a rush... well... at the very least I could foster him for her until she found a home.. if we didn't fall in love with him in the process.

Well I'm pretty happy right now because I almost cried in therapy and feel like she really gets me... has some different views about things in general but I like that. It makes her human rather than just like every other doctor out there. She even asked me if I wanted a hug before leaving and though I felt a little odd I nodded and she hugged me... I had to bend down to her a bit cuz she's shorter than me which is funny to me at this very moment because it didn't occur to me until just now. I was nervous and got all sweaty sitting there talking about such personal things. But I didn't hesitate. I told her a lot. And I like that she didn't jump to blaming my parents or upbringing. She said I need two afternoons off a week scheduled so I have that to look forward to. Tom complained that that idea was unfair seeing as he doesn't even get that. I glared at him for that and he said ""well I don't"" ""I have 2 jobs. I help around here when I get home and on weekends."" Of course he does help but most of the time he sleeps in on weekends and he gets to go out to help rob with things... that has been cut down on a lot because of my complaints and Rob generally not appreciating his help. But we had a system where he would get up sunday mornings and I got up saturdays and that has disappeared. I talked to him about it and he even said I actually have to remind him the night before to go to bed earlier so he can get up with the kids... hmm I wonder why I feel like I have three children... anyone guess?

So my next big question is... does anyone know a teenage girl looking to babysit cheap? I'm going to post on cafe mom about reliable babysitters in the area and stuff but I'm not sure where else to look.... any suggestions?"

"event","I'm so tired... all the time... but then the kids go to bed and I get wrapped up in the budget or just relaxing in general and suddenly my bed isn't calling me so insistently anymore. Last night I was up past 2 am which is a bad habit. But the night before last and the night before that I went to bed at 9pm and still didn't want to get up at 8am. I was still falling asleep on the couch while the kids were awake and still took a nap when they did. I've had a bad headache for the last 5 days or so. Tylenol does nothing for my headaches. My neck has been hurting for about a week so I figure that's causing the headaches... hopefully the chiropractor will help at least a little. I was supposed to go to my OB/GYN on monday for a follow up ultrasound due to cysts on my ovaries... Well I have been trying to get someone to watch the kids for a month. Just need someone to watch them long enough for me to walk around the corner to my doctor and get this ultrasound done. But I couldn't get ahold of my BIL most of the time and when I did I asked him to get his GF Carol's schedule to see when she would be able to watch them for me. He always forgot and Carol wasn't answering her phone. Caleb my neighbor is still in school but I thought maybe he could watch the kids after he got home from school but he of course prefers that they are sleeping when he is watching them. So I'm just screwed... I need to find a reliable teenage baysitter... maybe one who can help me clean up too. LOL yeah like that will ever happen. I can't trust anyone these days... well not when it comes to leaving them home alone with my kids. There are too many whackos out there. As a parent it would be horribly irresponsible of me if I left the kids with a baby sitter I barely knew. but the problem is even when you really get to know a person they could be completely different than what you know them to be like. I've had it happen to me before. I already went through worrying over a visit from CPS and almost ending up homeless because someone I trusted was not at all who I thought they were. People lie... I understand that but lieing about everything to a person who considers you a close friend... what would be the point in that? and yet she did it and it boggles my mind. So if she could do it with no apparent reason how am I supposed to trust a random baby sitter. Nobody but family, that lieing friend, and my neighbor have ever watched my kids... it's no wonder I feel trapped. I can't get to the doctor or go out for a movie or go out to the grocery store without being worried about someone else's schedule. I feel bad for wanting to spend the weekend at my mom's without the kids. You know... just thinking about the upcoming appointment with the psychologist has really got me thinking about a lot of stuff... hopefully she can help me sort out all my thoughts."

"event","I am going to see a psychologist saturday for the first time ever. I have not seen any therapist ever and I don't know what to expect. But I like the woman so far. I made the appointment for 2pm saturday and she was pretty easy to talk to and quite friendly. I found her through my insurance provider list. She is realy close so I will most likely be driving myself there. I really need to get my license but I have screwed up with over draws recently so it may be a little while before that happens because of money. 

I am starting to plan things out better and better everyday. I have part of my spending money set aside o save for a corgi puppy that I plan to get in August... probably between the 15th and the 30th... if I can't get the puppy right away I am going to just be waiting for the next litter from my chosen breeder. My plan is to make sure I have the cage and bedding and everything purchased before I even pick out my puppy. First things first though is getting my license and moving to a 3 bedroom or bigger house that will let us have a dog. Once we are settled in at the new place we can then plan out things for the dog and training and stuff. I am just so excited about the idea of moving to a house, getting a puppy, and also seeing a psychologist. All of it makes me nervous though too. It's a lot of change... but I seem to do well with change nd actually have come to like change a little too much. When nothing changes for a while I canget easily bored. Change for me does not have to be big. I enjoy getting new things for the apartment like nicer new towels, clothes for the kids, things to organize thngs around our apartment better. Heck I even like just having somehing scheduled to do like taking the kids to mcd's play place once a week, going to my mom's for kareoke, or hanging out with someone outside of the apartment. I don't think these things are too much to ask for once a week. But since I'm trying not to spend money getting new thigs doesn't work out so well. And meeting people... well... I've only planned anything with one person(Colby)and luck is not on our side because everything keeps getting in the way of that happening. Mcd's hasn't happened because the past 2 weekends I went to kareoke so I can't complain there. But this weekend I am determined to make something happen. I am going to the chiropractor, Tom's going to the doctor while the kids are napping, I'm going to my psychologist appointment afterwards and I am going to talk tom into taking the kids out to mcd's saturday night. I hopefully will beable to get him to go sunday night too just so I can get out of the house and the kids can interact with other kids. Plus I have a friend I can call to see if she wants to meet us up there with her kids... I met her there and said I'd call her anytime we were going up there. I met one other woman there the same way and promised the same thing but I lost the piece of paper she wrote her number on so the second time I made sure it was in my cell right away.

So hey colby want to hang out sunday? LOL You can meet all of us at the mcd's as long as you don't mind the screaming kids:) but I'm sure you would. It gets pretty loud in there. I just don't care cuz I'm so desperate to get out and get a break and not worry about the kids so much while I'm getting my break. Well hope we can meet up eventually."

"event","I'm depressed... again... I'm such a broken record and I'm so pathetic it pisses me off.

Hellgate london is going down as of January 31st, 2009. I just finally got back into it again and I still love the game and the access I currently have to subscriber stuff but I don't have enough time to enjoy it and say goodbye to the first real MMO I ever truly got into.

LJ is apparently doing a ton of layoffs which scares me because that's what was happening at flagship(the companyt that made hellgate london) and then all of a sudden they laid everyone off and went bankrupt. I can't lose LJ and hellgate in the same year... That would be such a horribly crippling blow to the little bit of happiness I always manage to cling to. One of the few things that keeps me going.

I'm up late again but I was in bed earlier. I had started my period so I figured since I told Tom he wouldn't bug me too much but then he didn't bug me at all. And of course for once I was starting to feel slightly in the mood. So I got him into it because he thought I was the one that didn't want to do nything during ""that time of the month"" but I told him how I was feeling. I was trying to get him to try something that we don't do very often... foreplay... not just any foreplay but foreplay without touch me between the legs. I thought this was a simple concept. He needed to work me up so I thought ok kissing, teasing, and the like until I asked him to take it further. Turns out this concept was way more complicated than it needed to be. He started saying so you gonna take your underwear off? Which I figured I would wait until we were almost done with foreplay so I was frustrated but I did it anyways figuring he would still follow the rules but just wanted me to be totally naked. Well then he started pushing like he was trying to initiate sex so I gave up and just said well can you do this while you go in and gave him instructions. I was enjoying it but definitely could have used some more foreplay but I could have dealt with it if he had kept doing things for me and him at the same time. But it quickly became majority about him so I truly gave up. I just flopped my hands down and laid there. Finally ding hello he gets the idea that I'm not happy. Hmm... I wonder why?! I explained this to him in shorter terms and he got all pissed off. He's like well you need to tell me exactly what you want as he rolled over deciding to bail on sex at all. I then had to explain to him that if I explain each step to him then its not a surprise and it doesn't work. He then said he needed a better general idea at least. When I very clearly stated as I have many times that I need more foreplay he then said well I just spent 20 minutes and then you told me start having sex with you. I told him no I told what I wanted since he was already trying to have sex. He insisted he wasn't and went to sleep mad. Un lucky for me... I can't sleep mad.

I want to cry and punch him in the face and take off to florida with the kids to hang out with my aunt for a month or so. But then I don't want to screw up the few good things I have going for me like a family who loves each other and a place to live and in general a life that could be much worse than it is. I couldnt keep the kids from tom and I would miss him... and I don't want to be like my parents who just get fucking divorced already. All they do is fight over everything no matter how big or small. They don't communicate my dad is always cranky and jumps to conclusions and is always blaming someone else for everything. My mom is overly sensitive, quick to blame too, holds grudges, guilt trips, and does most of the things she complains about other people doing. She talks about leaving my dad but I doubt she ever will.

I don't want to get a divorce or anything like that. I don't even want to be with anyone else even though I miss dating... but I relaize that's because I miss dating Tom. I miss when he tried so hard for me and I tried so hard back on particular things. Then as we got married and got more comfortable he stopped trying so hard and I just keep trying harder in hopes that if I'm good to him things will work out. He's not a horrible husband but he needs work. How do you tell your husband that he needs to try harder for you because you feel like you are the only one really trying anymore? I don't want it to sound like a threat like I'll leave you if you don't. But I am tired of feeling walked on all the time too... Help!"

Oh wait yeah I never did an entry from last weekend...

Okay so my mom came out and picked up the kids and me on friday after Tom got home from work. First Tom used her car to go pick up a dresser and a hutch we had scheduled to pick up from a fellow freecycler. Caleb went with him to help him lift stuff. They brought that back and we tried to get out the door asap because it was late and the kids were very tired. As usual keeley fell asleep in the car but she woke back up shortly after that and I had gotten mcdonald's chicken nuggets for the kids so she stayed awake most of the way to my parents house due to eating. When she fell asleep she really passed out so I ran in the house and set up her bed before moving her so she could go straight to bed. They didn't get to bed til 10pm! And Aiden even fought going to sleep despite the fact that he was very tired and cranky and my mom thought he wouldn't fight it at all. She had to give him a back rub to calm him down which never works when I try it but it worked for her.

I ended up being awake until 2 am since I hadn't had a whole lot of downtime and we got there so late. So I was thoroughly dead by morning. I was waiting to get a call from tom about when the armenian christmas party was starting and when we were going. He called and said his brother wasn't getting robbie til noon so instead of early morning we were waiting until after the kids nap to go. Tom showed up a little before the kids woke up from their nap and started shoveling the snow that was still falling.

We went to the armenian christmas party at the same place where we had my baby shower when I pregnant with aiden and the kids joint birthday party. When we walked in my FIL was there and he had all these little party favors for the kids. First ones he gave them were a big hit because they were like little wands with a star inside a globe on the end of one and a christmas tree inside a globe inside the other one. When you hit the button the star spun and lit up and the christmas tree one did the same but it also had white little fake snow peices that would get stirred up and float around. So robbie and Aiden were given the star ones which became used as lightsabers later on when Robbie started the idea of hitting Aiden's with his. Keeley got the christmas tree one which became a big point of amazement especially when she realized she was able to push the button and make it go herself.

This was keeley in her michigan state cheerleader outfit at my mom's house before the party.

<lj-embed id=""9""/>

My BIL came with his son Robbie, my grandmother in law alice came(Rob sr's mom), and that's all that showed up. We knew vanessa wasn't coming because of work and carol wasn't coming for the same reason... and my MIL was either not invited or just didn't show up as usual.

It wasn't a whole lot of people but it was still fun and gave Aiden and Robbie a lot of room to run around chasing each other and making faces at each other. I was too picky and not very hungry so I didn't really eat much and the kids weren't acting very hungry either so they just nibbles on grapes and croutons even though they hadn't hardly eaten lunch and it was around dinner time. On the way home we got mcdonald's for me and the kids and though keeley fell asleep before we got mcdonald's she must have heard us mention getting food because she woke up a little before we stopped to get it.

My dad took aiden in the backyard and took him practice sledding down the mountain of snow he had built up against the railing of the deck. He was so funny. I got videos that I need to upload... hopefully I'll remember... If I do remember I'll post it RIGHT HERE:

<lj-embed id=""7""/>


<lj-embed id=""8""/>



He went down on the sled and once he got to the bottom he fell back so he was laying flat on his back hands up in the air half on half off the sled. And he just laid there waiting to be helped lol. Keeley went down with my dad and she didn't like it but she didn't cry until she was at the bottom because she acted like she couldn't breath on the way down. We tried a couple more times to see if she would warm up to the idea and she didn't. So i got videos of Keeley going down the mountain for snow too and of them sitting on the outdoor swing playing with snow after that too. Then we took them inside and put them down for a nap. After their nap Aiden went with grandpa(papop) to the sledding hill at ford field(the one in dearborn) and spent about an hour going up and down the big hill. I wanted him to get videos of that but that would have been too complicated to have him do all that and all the video cameras were dead. So he just went and had fun and Keeley stayed at the house with me, my mom, and my grandma. I spent that time working on the scrapbook for my grandma without the pictures being printed. I just had the pictures scanned into my computer so I worked looking at the pictures that way. So I got probably about 8 pages set up for the book just gotta print out the pictures and the backing for the unique tags to write the dates and descriptions on."

"event","Tom got my 24 hour flu beginning the night of the day that I got better... or so we thought. He took it really hard and couldn't keep more than one sip of water down. I had to plug my ears because him getting sick was loud enough that down the hall in the living room I could clearly hear it. I was better but my stomach still wasn't perfectly happy with me yet. Keeley had also thrown up in bed the night that I was getting better. Tom spent wednesday in bed. He didn't get sick at all that day but he was so worn out from being so sick he just didn't want to get up except to go to the bathroom. I convinced him to get up eventually when I asked him to feed a fruit chiller thing to keeley because it was a frozen dessert and she couldn't manage the spoon so she kept whining cuz she made her hands too cold trying to eat it with her hands. I got the kids bath ready while she was still eating and aiden went in first. Tom brought keeley in to me when he was done feeding her dessert to her.

Keeley got sick in bed again that night. Tom's kidney's were bothering him but he didn't get sick anymore. In fact he felt well enough that he started begging for something in bed. I gave him the ""yeah but you still feel sick"" and he said yeah so... Well I gave in and he had fun but then complained of burning right after. He rolled of still having the burning but managed to fall asleep. In the morning he had to pee so he got up and went to the bathroom. He said he started peeing and then all of a sudden stopped but still felt like he was peeing kinda. Then all of a sudden he said it felt like he was passing a bubble.  It didn't hurt but.. he passed his kidney stone!! He had to fish it out of the toilet because he said he was not waiting for the next one to occur and pass to try to catch that one. Now that he caught it and saved it they can test it to see what it's made of and therefore give him proper instructions on how to prevent his stones. He was so happy he passed it that he took it with him to work to show a cowarker that likes to give him crap for missing work. When he started giving him crap he showed it to him and the guy said... ""wait... that came out of your..."" Tom said yep and the guy was like oh ok I understand you being out of work I would be too. I can just imagine him walking away with his legs crossed like he got kicked in the nuts. LOL Well anyways we figured out the throwing up and fever and stuff he had was probably his kidney stone because his brother had all that a couple days before passing his stone too.

So Tom's kidneys are still sore but at least he passed the stone. I can't wait to hear what it's made out of. I can almost guarantee the majority will be caffeine and calcium but he's determined that's not it.

wednesday night I did a bunch of picking up and throwing away all the stuff that accumulated from the kids playing with their toys and getting into stuff while we weren't feeling the best. So it looked a lot better after that but still needed work. Then yesterday I picked up a lot more and even managed to vacuum. I was really tired but somehow I managed to motivate myself to do all that and around 5pm last night I even started letting keeley run around naked and setting a timer to put her on the potty every 20 minutes. She didn't go in the potty but she didn't go at all so I'm planning start that again after I get off the computer because they just got done eating and are watching tv. She absolutely loved it when I put her on the potty last night and she even went and sat on it a couple times on her own. She gets upset when aiden is allowed to go in the bathroom to dump the potty and flush the toilet and wash his hands. I won't let her go in there because she has tried to splash her hands in the toilet too many times. But it also became an incentive for potty training because I told her she can only go in there if she starts using the potty like her brother. She seems interested so I figured why not. Plus it makes me focus on the kids more and not get tired so quick before nap time.

Tonight my mom is coming out so we can use her car to pick up a dresser and hutch from freecycle.

Saturday morning at 10am we are going to look at meadow lake in white lake... a manufactured home subdivision we might move to. Then we are probably going straight to allen park for Tom's family's armenian christmas. After that the kids and I are supposed to spend the night at my parents house. My mom and I are going out to kareoke after the kids are in bed. My dad will be home so somebody will be there with the kids. 

We will probably go home the next afternoon after the kids nap. Tom is going to a business appointment about server protection options for his work and should be home before us because it is in royal oak but they shouldn't take too long he is just going in to find out pricing. Then maybe we will take the kids to the mcds play place again. After the kids are in bed I get to meet Colby!! Yay!!! And yes Colby that is still the plan and tom agreed to watch the kids no problem.

Well... better go potty training and underwear training time!"

"event","So I caught the 24 hour flu that's been going arund. I mentioned how I was wanting to pue but couldn't in my last entry... yeah well... probably about 3 hours late of trying to sleep and not succeeding and cramping and aching like crazy I decided to go sit on the couch with a bucket. I could still smell te pke o the couch from when keeley puked on me even though Tom had cleaned it up. That was all it took and boy was I glad I had that bucket. That's t only time I actually got sick at all yesterday and it made me feel so much better I thought I would be ok after that. But I continued to be achy and after a bit my cramping in my stomach came back. I was going hot and cold... my fet consistently stayed cold though. I actually had to take like 5 hot baths throughout the day because that was the only thing that warmed my feet up and eased my aches and pains. I wanted to sleep in the tub because that was the only place I was remotely comfortable. But even then my head was on the hard side of the tub with my neck in a weird and unconfortable position. I want so badly to have a cushioned tub like a pillowtop on a bed but waterproof. I would have been sound asleep in no time had I had that. Waking up to change out the cold water for fresh hot water every so often wouldn't have bothered me because I would have actually been getting sleep. I actually had to have Tom call off work because I could not take care of the kids in that condition. I tried sleeping but laying down made my stomach hurt more. I ate nothing all day because thinking, hearing, seeing, or talking about food mad want to puke. Everything hurt and whe my huby was prompted to ask how I was doing by my FIL on the phone I replied ""I'm dieing"". I was only half joking when I said that. It was just such a miserable day and because it was all flu symptoms I thought it was going to be a week before I felt better. When I wasn't in bed I was wrapped up in our big comforter on the couch like it was my coccoon, half sitting half laying down because that was the closest I could get to being comfortable outside of taking another hot bath. I got tired of tryng to sleep so I was sitting on the couch after I had gotten a little sleep while the kidswere still awake. I got up to help Tom put the kids to bed but Caleb showed up so I pawned that helping job off on him. Being so achy I definitely didn't want to move around more than I had to. I sat talking and feeling crappy and wanting to go to bed but knowing I wouldn't be able to sleep with all the cramping and aching. Caleb said he had some swanson broth at home from when he had had mono and he'd go get it if I wanted it. I didn't really want plain broth but I decided it was better than the low sodium curly noodle we had that would probably make me hurl even on a good day. So he went and got it and warmed it up for me and I started taking small spoonfuls seeing how it hit me. I didn't like all the salt but it didn't bother my stomach. So then I drank it and I kept it down so I drank about half of the stuff and waited a little while and my cramps seemed to be easing off so I went to bed hopng to sleep a little. Well I couldn't sleep cuz of being achy so I took a hot bath and kinda fell sleep in it a little bit. I finally got out and dried off and went to bed and it took me a while but I got to sleep. I slept pretty well for a while and when I woke up around 1am or so when Tom was coming to bed most of my aches aside from my back were gone. Tom asked how I was feeling and I said better and asked why then he said he wanted to know if he was waking up for work. I told him I was doing well enough and I'd just let him know if it came back. I don't remember falling asleep again but I was awake for a while after that because I finally felt better and had gotten some sleep. But I stayed in bed because I was afraid if I got up it would all come back. This morning I woke up and got the kids up around 8am no problem. Tom took forevr to wake up and get up but he did it and he went to work. He's not feeling so great but I think it's his kidneys more than anything. I'm just gladd I'm feeling better today. I talked to jessie gant when she called last night and told her I'd call her back when I got better but warned her it might be a week... won't she be surprised to hear from me tonight... If I don't pass out after the kids go to bed... which I doubt but who knows.

So now my back hurts but probably mor from the baths and weird ways I sat yesterday. I do have a headache but not really bad. And an occasional cough. But compared to yesterday I feel like a million bucks. Now if I just get some deep sleep cuz the sleep I've been getting has been really light.

My parents are going to my great aunt jean's funeral tomorrow so they are driving down today.

Aiden likes to say dance and he told keeley to dance last night. He was holding her music player that I got her for christmas and pushing the buttons and dancing when we started telling keeley to dance. So he faced her still dancing and pushing buttons and said ""dance keeley, dance"" several times until she cautiously started dancing because caleb was over with his friend chuck and she doesn't know him ss she wasn't sure she wanted to show him her dancing. It was just so adorable."

"event","So I started to break down today. I was on the computer and Keeley wouldn't leave me alone so I closed the computer and put it aside thinking she wanted attention. But she was just so whiny and kept throwing herself across me and head butting me and I couldn't handle it. 

On top of that I had been looking into houses for rent inn dearborn because tom had agreed to rent there so I could be closer to my family, have more help, and see my grandma more while I still have the chance. ll this death in the family and around me has me really worried. If my grandma gets the flu or pneumonia she will most likely die. Heck a bad cold could do her in. Anytime I call her and she doesn't answer I call my mom to see if she has heard from her because we both worry that we will not hear from her one day and then go over there and find her laying on the floor dead. Her body can't handle much more. She does really well for being 83... or so but she has diabetes, asthma, glaucoma, carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, osteoperosis, had skin cancer and keeps getting more removed and who knows what else. Well the point of all this is to say I was thrilled that Tom agreed to move closer to her until we get a house. But then today he took back that decision because he realized it would take away some of his job security. He gets called into work whenever there is a problem but if we lived and hour away his boss wouldn't call him for that stuff all the time and therefore he would be less useful to the company. So yes I understand why and it makes sense and I honestly thought of that to begin with. But I figure when he agreed that it meant it wouldn't be that much of a prblem. So I understand why and it is logical and that's why I'm not fighting him on it. But that doesn't mean I'm not mad. I got my hopes up and was getting all excited about living in the dearborn area again. Now I'm rationalizing that yeah we will save money on gas, he'll see the kids more, he'll have more job security, etc. just from staying in this area. But I can't stop being upset that he agreed to it first without thinking and just dashed my hopes like that today.

So we are still looking for as many options as possible in waterford and auburn hills for 3 bedroom with 1,000 sq ft minimum, in unit washer and dryer hookups and preferred to have the washer and dryer provided at no extra charge, first floor, central air, and hopefully accepts dogs under 30lbs. All that for $800 or less per month.

Right now I am awake because I went to bed around 7pm woke up at 11:40pm and tried to go back to bed at 1:30am but I can't cuz I feel sick to my stomach. It doesn't help that Keeley puked all over me right before bed time. And I mean she puked all over my arm, my leg, the couch and herself. I can't stop thinking about it and being grossed out and I keep smelling it even though it's been cleaned up and I washed my arm and changed my clothes and everything. She has never puked like that except one time in her bed and I didn't know until it was dry on her blanket and it looked like saurkraut so she hasn't been allowed to have that since then. I feel like I'm gonn puke but I can't. I'm sitting in the bathroom typing and drinking water hoping to feel better so I can go to bed because I'm exhausted and I'm pretty sure I have had a cold for the past couple days too. Tom's kidneys have been acting up and the kids have been whiny and tired a lot. Keeley has been drooling everywhere while walking around even. So she's teething and none of us are feeling well. Sounds fun doesn't it? yeah right... I better go try to go to bed."

"event","My great aunt jean(my late grandma mccauley's sister) died yesterday morning at 4 am. So Saturday January 3rd, 2009 4:00am. I guess it was basically that she got pneumonia a couple times and it made it so hard for her to breath that she just couldn't do anything anymore. My mom and dad were just going to go down to see her because they found out the day before that she was going into hospice and she wasn't really talking or aware of anything or anyone and she was dieing. I wanted to go but I couldn't drag the kids to youngstown and back for a one day trip and I couldn't leave tom with them in case his kidneys started acting up because him being alone with them in that much pain wouldn't be good and neither would him having to take vicodin with the kids here alone. So they got the call that she had passed away just after they woke up that morning. My dad called me and gave me the news. The arrangements are unfortunately made for teusday and wednesday this week so that means none of us can go with my dad working, my mom not wanting to go, tom working and us not having a car that we can take on that long of a drive anyways. I wasn't horribly close to her and I did get to see her this past summer and we even took the kids. It's just upsetting to have so many deaths in the family and stuff recently.

"event","I'm so ticked off right now.

I was doing so good and was getting really excited because things seemed to be looking up.

I worked out the budget so we should be done filing bankruptcy by febuary no problem despite our self inflicted setbacks of spending some of the money we were supposed to set aside for bankruptcy. I think I just keep getting scared and overwhelmed with the bankruptcy so it is easier to say ""we need these things"" and ""we can just make up the difference next check"". We should have long since started the bankruptcy filing and been saving money on top of that. But anyways I worked it all out except for the 2 counseling sessions we have to do over the phone because I couldn't find any written price for those sessions... I'm calling to figure out those prices when I'm done typing here.(nvm I called on that and figured that out after typing this and forgetting to post so I'm just adding notes to this saved draft and posting it)

Tom and I went out to dinner and went to see Bedtime Stories at the waterford theater last night. We went to applebee's and I had steak, shrimp, broccoli with cheese, and french fries with pepper on them(i didn't eat them cuz i hate pepper and I was pretty full after everything else anyways). Tom had steak and cheese quesadillas, buffalo wings, and some little hambuger thing... all in like a sampler. Then we went to walmart to get diapers and wipes and batteries. I ended up getting aiden a windbraker and pants set with wall e on them, a long sleeve shirt with wall e carrying a christmas tree that had lights in wall e and was on clearance, and a wall e bean bag chair. We also got 2 egyptian cotton towels and washcloths and 2 floor lamps(one for the kids room and one for the front room) but we forgot to get lightbulbs and remembered when we were already at the car and almost late for the movie. Tom got all ticked because I talked about how we should get a quit kit so he could try quitting smoking again. Sure i was pushing him but I haven't even been mentioning it at all and well.. we see how much good that has been doing as far as getting him to quit since he's still smoking a pack every 2 days. So we didn't get a quit kit because he was so pissy about it. The movie was really funny and I really liked it. I thought it was a little of a different approach than most movies these days. We went right home after that because tom had to go to the bathroom and he doesn't like using public bathrooms.

We discussed looking into 3 bedroom apartments before and especially when I had my venting session with tom and he asked what we could do to help make me happy. Since we decided on waiting 2 more years to try getting a house I decided I need to have the extra bedroom so I can separate the kids. It would be much less stressful because they won't sleep for their nap if they are in the same room. So instead of going to bed when we got home I stayed up and started looking into 3 bedroom apartments right away. I found some promising ones but I'm still looking."

"event","So today was an interesting day. We were going to go to the chiropractor but Tom wasn't feeling so good and said he couldn't get up. I asked if we were going to the christmas thing for my mom's side of the family and he said he would see how he felt later but he did want to go to that. I needed to go to the chiroprctor so it was frustrating that he made it sound like he didn't want to go to that and that's why we weren't going. But I was just happy he didn't say we weren't going to the christmas thing. Aiden started saying Bot Bots like he has been saying a lot lately and Keeley started repeating it after him right before their nap. I put them down around 11am and just hoped tom would feel better after we all were done napping. By 2pm I was awake and asking Tom if he felt better to the point of being able to go. He said yeah. I was shocked the kids were still passed out so I went in the living room to let my mom know we were coming and wake keeley up because she heard me talking right next to her playpen where she was sleeping. Then befor I could even manage to finsh going to the bathroom Aiden was awake and whining to be let out of his room. I got things together as quickly as possible without rushing though so i didn't forget anything. i didn't want to lug around a ton of stuff so I packed bare essentials for the kids
diapers
wipes
a change of clothes each
a sippy cup each
and a minimum of one toy each for the ride there
We brought their coats but it was warm enough that they just wore hoodies over their long sleeves and they were fine. We stepped outside the door and keeley immediately tripped and fell getting her dress a little dirty. I picked her up to avoid further stains on her christmas dress. Then we got all settled into the car and tried to start it. It didn't want to start at all. It took 20 minutes before Tom finally got it started and then the car was still working really hard at running and idling. It was running really slow and accelerating took forever. The tire was low on air again so we stopped at the gas station to fill it up and tom got me a pop. Then we started the long 1 and a half hour drive there. The kids were so happy to get out of the car. I was disappointed to find out I got there just after my cousin sonja left and she had the kids with her! I never have seen her twins at all...:( oh well I don't care as much as I used to because she has neglected to show up to anything and she abandoned her 4 kids with her husband 2 times. I feel sorry for the kids but me meeting the twins wouldn't change anything for them so I don't know why it matters to me at all. Just bugs me I'm the only one who hasn't met them in the family now. I played contract rummy after the kids opened their gifts of geo trax, another baby doll, and some clothes. The game was going horribly for me and Keeley was getting cranky and crying a lot and I ended up just having to quit in the last hand because that is always the longest hand anyways. We didn't leave til probably 9pm as it was. Keeley passed out real quick and I was hungry so we stopped at mcd's and when i came back with chicken nuggets Aiden started yelling chicken nuts which is what he says for chicken nuggets ever since this past week at my parents' house. Tom told me that while i was in mcd's Aiden reached over to steal keeley's sippy cup. When Tom looked back and caught him aiden said quietly ""Keeley's sleeping"" and very slowly continued to take the sippy cup watching Tom the whole time. I just love my kids so much. they are just too funny. Well now I need to go to bed but tomorrow Tom and i are going to see Bedtime Stories after the kids go to sleep. Caleb is staying here with the kids for us. And I'm excited because i think the last movie Tom and I went to see in theaters was either meet the robinson's or Ultraviolet within the first couple days after it was released... whichever one came last. I need to sleep so i don't fall asleep in the theater. lol"

The fact that I opened up to tom and cried so much made him say see this is what you need to do... but he made it sound like I don't need to see a therapist and I think I still do.

"event","An amazng thing happened christmas night...

I TALKED TO MY HUSBAND!!!

Now I know that doesn't sound huge but it was because I wasn't chatting or just talking about nothing. I really opened up to him more than ever which I thought was impossible because I'm not the sort of person to hide things and especially not emotions from anyone let alone my husband. But I risked embarassment and bared my soul... sort of. I'm sure there is a ton more I could have let out and will soon. But last night was the first time I just told him what was on my mind what was bothering me without worrying about sounding stupid or whiny or pathetic.

I was blubbering by the time I really started to open up and it was like a flood of words and tears. I told him how I don't feel good enough and how christmas is so disappointing and it just gets worse every year. I would literally bend over backwards for every person I care about but their love for me seems so conditional aside from my husband and kids. 

My mom's side of the family has always been so close but when my aunt died Febuary 1st,2006... I feel bad but I'm not sure if that date is right... but it probably is. It's in my journal but I'll have to look it up and link back to it later...  it seemed like we started drifting apart as we were saying our goodbyes to her in the hospital. My aunt was so close to me even though I didn't see her that much and I feel so bad for not having let her know what she meant to me. Heck I didn't know how much she meant to me until I finally let go and cry that day that went to see her in the hospital and at 2:22pm found out she was brain dead and the support was the only thing keeping her body alive. I went to the hospital expecting to show her pictures of my new puppy because she had been to the hospital so many times it seemed routine. I knew it was different because my cousin called and she wouldn't tell me why my aunt was in the hospital just that we had to be there. I didn't expect her to be unconscious when we got there though. I thought I would get to talk to her and have her respond. But when she was unconscious it was unreal and I couldn't cry. I had seen many dead people at funeral viewings and on TV and had even seen my grandpa in bed sick all the time with colin cancer. But with my grandpa I was 5 and the funerals were all people I wasn't really close to. I had never been blindsided with anyone getting sick like that in my life. She had a heart attack and we all knew she was sick and dying but nobody knew when she would die. We knew it would be soon but we didn't know it would be less than a year. 

She had actually been out shopping with my grandma the day before. She locked herself out of her car and called the tow truck and then called a different company got a cheaper quote and called and cancelled the first one. She was still my fiery aunt the day before. But then she was feeling sick and laid down on the couch while baby sitting my second cousin emily who was probably like 5 at the time I think. Her grandma ended up coming over because my aunt was so sick and she couldn't even answer the door for her so emily had to do it. Then while her grandma was there trying to coax my aunt into going to the hospital she had the heart attack. She had refused to go by ambulance because she wanted to get dressed and put on her makeup and stuff first. She ended up going by ambulance because she collapsed the grandma called 911 and tried to recesitate(sp?) while waiting for the ambulance. I guess my aunt was still talking but she wasn't making much sense and then she just stopped right before paramedics arrived. They estimate she was probably out of oxygen for too long being she had COPD(the bottom of her lungs were dead... like the bottom quarter of them so she was low on oxygen to begin with.) I'm sure that didn't help. They figure she was probably brain dead before they even got to her house but they didn't confirm it until many hours later when we were all gathered in a small conference room that was more like a large closet. They told us all that she was brain dead and suggested taking her off the support. They said they could keep her alive for a couple more hours but even then they would be doing cpr pretty often and would probably end up breaking her ribs and putting her in more pain. They took her off support and she died at 4:01pm just minutes before my cousin micheal had showed up to say goodbye. We had been talking to her boyfriend on the phone telling him what was going on as he tried to rush back from being on a run(he was a truck driver) in indiana. He was still more than an hour away when we knew she was brain dead. Nobody wanted to tell him but we had to tell him to pull over to the side of the road and stop rushing because he wouldn't make it no matter what and we didn't want him to die in an accident trying to get there for no reason. He never did get to say goodbye and I think that still kills him more than anything to this day. 

He's the one that was so rude to me about the laptops a couple days ago. And I know he's having problems dealing with his emotions but what kills me is that he probably won't appologize without being coaxed into it and my mom thinks he doesn't know how much he hurt me. He probably doesn't but I just hope that once he does know he will appologize. I ended up telling Tom about that incident too because i can't keep secrets from my husband especially when they are making me depressed on christmas. He promised my dad he wouldn't say anything to JW but I told my mom about telling tom and she said she would pull JW aside before we get there and explain things to him and try to get him to appologize. My family often avoids ever talking about these things to each other and it kills me to have to pretend like nothing happened. So this is a big step for my mom if she actually does it.

Some of the other things I told Tom were things like how I don't feel good enough and like I don't do enough. He reassured me I'm a great mom and I've been doing just fine with the cleaning. He told me he realized a couple months ago that his expectations of me were far to high and very unrealistic. I think that realization may have come in when he had to watch the kids alone for a weekend especially. 

Well christmas day was ok. We did a fun ""white elephant gift exchange"" at my aunt's. My mom put an old ""teddy"" of hers(the lingerie) in her white elephant gift and of course becuase tom knew about that and was traumatized enough hearing about it we ended up with that gift. We also got a redneck windchime that is a pick up truck with like beer bottles and a fishing pole and and old boot an stuff hanging from it. Aiden loves the thing cuz it's a truck lol. Aiden went chocolate crazy and enjoyed playing the drums. We got a video so here it is... crappy cuz it was dark and I haven't even watched it yet but here it is.

<lj-embed id=""6""/>

Well Aside from that Today was a crappy day. I didn't want to wake up cuz I was up til 4am for god knows what reason. I progressively felt worse as the day progressed and I had a headache that made me not want to move by the time tom left workand wasn't even home yet. Aiden and Keeley tore apart the apartment and I until i truly feel better I don't even care about cleaning it up. I feel bad because Tom cleaned like crazy while I was at my mom's house for about a week to let him recover from his kidney stone that made him pee blood and go to the hospital. But he understands that i feel so crappy.. probably getting sick from a lack of sleep. So I went to bed when the kids went down today. Right before bed though they were chasing each other and Aiden hugged Keeley which he never does and she hugged him back and didn't want to let go so they had a hugging war and she finally let go when he tried to run away and then she chased him. It was so cute. They were just going crazy. I took some motrin put the kids to bed and went to bed myself until midnight when I woke up unable to sleep even though I was tired and groggy but my headache seemed to be gone and I needed to eat. Tom was getting ready for bed but when I told him I was going to get up and watch Tv with him he said that's fine and grabbed some cookies and milk and we sat down to watch the Reba I have on the DVR because we are getting rid of that ASAP thanks to the fact it takes it our bill from $79 all the way to $99 and it's just not worth it when we can rig my computer up to watch live tv and record it and even run it through the media center to watch it on the tv. Well Tom went to bed like 2 hours ago and I went with him but then I couldn't sleep knowing my journal was unfinished so I got up to finish it and possibly look at the budget.

I did confront tom about saying I'm not a writer because he asked why I mentioned his book today. I had asked him how his writing on his book was going. He told me he lost it when his hard drive crashed because he got most of the stuff off it but then he had to wipe it out and forgot to get the book off it. Well I explained how hurt I was that he told me I wasn't a writer and that he was and then he denied ever saying he was a writer because he doesn't consider himself a writer either. He said calling yourself a writer means it is your profession or title. I told him no for me it's a hobby. Being a pro means you call yourself and author or a poet. I consider saying I'm a writer means I like to write. I enjoy it. It's my hobby. I haven't been able to get my thoughts in order to do anything but write in my journal recently but I still consider myself a writer. I guess it wouldn't hurt so much and I would understand if he would just read something that I write. But the only thing I write right now is my journal and he won't read the old poetry and stuff because he says he knows me I'm his wife he doesn't need to read that stuff to know me. I beg to differ because my writing is like another side to me... does that make sense? Does anyone else feel that way? I think I need to be clear... he also doesn't understand poetry and thinks that if it doesn't rhyme it's not really poetry. I have always been big on poetry and even did a project where I had to explain over 50 different kinds of poetry and write a unique example of each one. Maybe I need to find that project and have him read it to make him understand. But he wouldn't want to read that either...



Exciting side note:
Keeley has started saying more words now. At my parents' house she said da doo in place of thank you and that's how aiden started saying thank you. She also said eyes with a little lisp so it was with a th instead of a y. When she said that I guess she poked my mom in the eye instead of herself like aiden always did when he first said eyes. Then at my aunt mary's house on christmas day she said nose and pointed to her nose. Than today she said hot dog(actually de dog just like aiden says it most of the time) when she saw me getting out the hot dogs for lunch.

Oh and on christmas when there was a ton of chocolate and stuff within reach for aiden to get and I had to cut him off and keep telling him no he learned chocolate or as he says ""chocy"". He ran around screaming that everytime he tried to get some chocolate and I told him no. I actually had to pry one of the gold foil wrapped chocolate coins out of his mouth just before we left because he only took one side of the wrapper off and I didn't want him to have anymore chocolate that late anyways. And man that kid has a strong jaw but my fingers are stronger when I want them to be LOL."

"event","Frustrated... pissed of... feeling like I need to move but not wanting to... I'm wide awake! I am at my parents house and the kids opened their presents today.

Aiden loved ripping open the presents and keeley needed some help but she LOVED all her presents. She got so happy about even the simplest ones like clothes but clothes were quickly thrown over the shoulder by both of them.

Aiden loves his rock em sock em robots like thing. It is wrestlers instead of robots. It has up to 4 players and instead of their head popping up they actually fall off their stand when you lose and can even fly out of the ring. He even won against my dad and I 2 times and we weren't letting him win either. He was thrilled with his numerous gifts and particularly his Wall E themed ones like the figurine of wall e and eve and his pillow and blanket that he is currently sleeping with.

My mom got a massager that I thought I loved when I tried it in the store but then I tried my moms and it's different because its on the couch I guess.... But i don't want it anymore.

My dad got a deep fryer that is a cool touch kind with a basket and a lid but it only does like 1-2 chickn breasts at a time so though I considered getting it for us too I'm thinking I need to find a bigger version.

I got a set of pyrex bakewre pans and lids and tote to make it easier to transport and that is really nice. Finally I have a way to participate in the family potlucks for every holiday.

I want to go out and conquer the world tonight.

Has anyone ever felt like that?

I just want to go take a long relaxing shower then go out dancing at a club, take a karate class and have a good sparring match, sing some karaoke, chat with someone at starbucks about everythig and nothing, drive some go carts, go bowling, make a snowman, go sledding, play laser tag, jump in a moon bounce, go on some roller coasters, Sscream at the top of my lungs and not worry about anyone around me geting mad about it or waking up or somehow getting me in trouble for it, run at full speed around bally's track in the one bally's I used to go to before marrying Tom because I felt confident there and actually could accomplish some decent speed and laps there.... etc. etc.

I need a license, a car, a therapist, a challenging but encouraging martial arts class to attend in my area, a place to go take out my frustrations at top volume and force at any hour of the day or night, a playgroup or class to take the kids to on a regular basis to get out of the house and have kids for them to play with and adults for me to talk to, a support group for me to whine in at any time online where I can feel like people will read it and nt judge and actually respond too, and some help fnding a wy to get all this and soon because none of it is a want.. it is all needs! This all together is what I need to kee from exploding I believe. I am just solidifying my thoughts to realize all that I need. I need tom to read my writing in poetry, songs, and my journal and not tell me I'm not a writer. I need him to take me seriously as an adult and an individual not just his weird quirky wife and mother to his kids. Sure I could say this but it never comes out right. I get interupted or he doesn't understand and I get fristrated before Ican ever explain it to him. He used to read my stuff but he literally told me more recently ""I don't need to read that stuff. You are my wife."" WTF?! does that make sense to you?

On top of all this my uncle JW decided to make me feel like shit today because we got a laptop set up for my cousin that he is paying us for after he already bought one from us for himself. I found out he passed his own laptop off to my cousin but that was meant for JW and the newer laptop was meant exclusively for my cousin because he needs the more high tech up to date stuff for school and undestands it better than my uncle. I was trying to explain this to him just so he would tell my cousin about needing to bring the laptop to xmas with him so we could transfer any files he had accumulated on my uncles laptop to his new laptop and get my uncles back to him. My uncle started yelling at me and getting pissed that I wasn't just going to give him the laptop meant for my cousin and saying since he was paying for it he didn't s why it should matter. He just wouldn't listen and I said ""Well, I'm sorry I'm not trying to be mean to you..."" and before i could continue he said ""well you are... but that's ok we'll just see which one he picks"" I couldn't take it anymore so I just said ok bye. Then I hung up and started crying as I started explaining it to my grandma and my mom. My uncle has never spoken to me like that ever. He has always been very happy and nice and for him to be so rude and short with me for no apparent reason... it was crushing to my spirit. With my current anxiety issues set aside I still would have cried but because they are still a problem I still sit here so pissed... I have no idea how I am going to handle that side of the family's xmas without saying anything. I have decied to just ignore that he did that and not tell tom because tom would probably tell him to give his laptop back and tell him off for talking to me that way. e really likes jw but he has no tolerance for people acting like that and I just don't want to cause huge problems i the family by telling everybody about what happened. I know it is safe to type here because nobody close to me really reads this. But in the meantime this only builds my anxiety issues because I feel on the verge of tears about this no matter how hard I try not to let it bother me. Maybe I'll be calmer by saturday but righ now I can't see myself doing anything but sitting in a chair not talking to anybody much and just biding my time until we leave. Hear as it is I am about to cr just thinking about it because I used to really love christmas and each year it becomes a bigger and bigger disappointment and more of a stress than it even feels like it is worth. But I do it for the kids and for the hope that one day I will enjoy christmas again. 

I better go take a shower cuz I need it and I don't want to cry in front of my dad sitting here on the other end of the couch. I would end up having to explain it and then feel silly for making such a big deal out of it. Bt I can't help it. My feelings are hurt and my grandma says he probably didn't mean it and won't remember by saturday but that makes it worse. Like he can disregard my feelings whenever he chooses and thn act like it never hapened... that is not fair and makes me feel like I mean nothing to him. I think what hurts the most is that he told me he was disappointed in me for being mean to him. He was rude to me and I feel like I'm not allowed to tell him how I feel but when I was trying to be nice and explain things and arrange to help people out with cheap laptops he can just tell me I'm being mean for trying to get the appropriate laptop to the appropriate person... FwgjkmjahaghHRSHJRSAthyjsr!!!! I hate when people disregard my feelings before they speak to me even moreso now because I have not hidden my unstable emotional state and have been having trouble long enough that everyone should know... But yet because he is having problems emotionally too I am jus supposed to write it off I guess.

I seriously feel like my feelings don't matter to anyone... well they do to tom but i can't tell him about this ad he often doesn't understand my problems and how bad they are no matter how hard I try to explain them. Well it's shower time before burst into tears... don't know why I type this... no body will read it except for me when I look back o this later and think of how melodramatic and stupid all this is.... but right now this is my life and it is out of control to the point that I want to become a hermit and avoid people fr the most part. How many time do I need to scream, type, write, talk about, and beg for help before it really happens?! I can't do it all myself and I need help geting help obviously or I'd be seeing someone already. I just want to feel better and stop all the drama... ok I'm really going to bed now and hopefully not crying myself into dehydration but most likely that is what will happen."

"event","I should be in bed... but I'm not.

I should be happy... but I'm not.

Here begins a New chapter of my life... more like a new book because I know it will be long.

I am going to be fully honest even more than before.

I know, I know if you have ever read my journal before you are probably thinking ""Oh god! longer than before?!"" Hopefully not. Hopefully it will make more sense and be less blabbering about nothing.

I hate my life. I know I sound like a melodramatic teenager but that's also what I feel like most days.

Okay being honest I don't hate my life. I love my kids and my husband and aside from wanting more money or needing a house I don't have a whole lot to complain about. For the most part my kids are good kids too.

But I feel incomplete. I don't know if I need to start making money or if I just want another kid so I can be done having kids all at once or if it is something that hasn't occured to me at all yet.

Everything about my life frustrates me everyday. I only feel happy when I'm playing with my kids and that is short lived. Especially because I don't play with them as much as I should. They need more attentin than I give them. Maybe I'm slipping back into depression but at the very least I do know that this anger problem started it all.

I need someone to talk it out with. Someone neutral. I'm working on finding a therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist depening on which is closest and seems to meet my needs.

I feel so needy and whiny because everytime I feel better I start to crash shortly after again.

I'm not suicidal but I am absolutely feeling crippled by this anger thing. It's like an attack and I want to say it's like anxiety attacks but at the same time I don't. I mean I want to explain it and panic or anxiety attacks seem most likely but I don't want it to be something that severe or possibly permanent. I felt so much better for a couple of months and then all of a sudden I feel like I am back to not being able to handle anything.

I tried playing a new first person shooter that Tom and I both got and my nephew is getting for christmas and my BIL should be getting soon. This is important for me to be able to play because I can't justify going to MP CON if I can't play a game with everyone else there without getting so pissed off I can't play it anymore. I got so pissed off last night I wanted throw stuff and punch my monitor and just go on a rampage. I shut it all off and was going to go to bed but I was too worked up to do that so I cleaned up the front room. That made me feel better about things being clean but I was still pissed. This then makes it impossible to sleep until I'm exhausted and even then it's hard.

I am up now for the same thing. I got pissed off because I opened a bill from comcast that I'm sure was billed and sent out before the last time I made a payment but I couldn't be sure. So I called comcast who is supposed to be 24/7 support but they lie about that apparently. I just wanted to make sure the balance on our account as still 0 to confirm the bill in my hand was not current. I wanted to use the automated system which it requested I use but when I selected the correct options it sent me to a message saying I reached them after hours and then the message gave me intructions to use the automated system. I followed the instructions and spent the next 10 minutes in the same F@!#%%^ loop over and over. I tried hanging up and calling again and it just kept doing the same thing to me. If I had an option I would never use comcast again. I'm so fed up with their stupidity but unfortunately they are the only high speed option out here and tom has to have high speed for work. I can't sign in online to check anything because I have an email account but they screwed up their login stuff and my email is not linked to the account stuff on comcast.net and nobody can tell me hw to fix it or find the account that is. And of course that is the site I need to login to to see my balance and pay it online. I am going to explode and the worst part is... I know I will have to be the one to pick up the peices of myself after the f&#**%(@# explosion too!!!!

This stuff is frustrating to anyone but it's so bad for me right now that if I didn't have kids I wouldn't kill myself but I'd be no good. I would be in bed avoiding the world most of the time and when I got up I'd be zoning on my favorite show reba or surfing the internet for something specfic and then going right back to bed. I'd just be avoiding the world at all costs because I hate beig angry and my life consists of nothing but anger when I'm awake pretty much. I need help and I need it bad but even saying that out loud to my husband doesn't seem to click to him how bad it is. He just says ok find a therapist and we'll go. Which translates to me as great one more thing to add to my endless list of things to do. Don't worry honey! I'll write Save Myself just below tackle mountain of laundry and collect every bill for filing bankruptcy... hmm ... wonder why it doesn't get done! AHLHDKHJVCKLERJWL#@KL:KOV#FD:#RK:!!!! I need to scream but it's almost 3am and I'm pretty sure my neighbors would hate me and my kids would wake up and screaming into a pillow( still too loud) is just not enough at this point. I'm really starting to worry that I might just spontaneously combust from all this oneday."

"event","I am new to handmaking crafts but I would like to see what people think of my product before I make a site to sell it. So if you are interested in this product please let me know. I came up with it for scrapbooking because I wanted a unique flower that I could stick on to my pages without messing with glue. So just a note these are mounted on a sticky dot suitable for archiving. If you like them I'd also like to know what you would believe to be a reasonable price for one?

"event","my mother is a frosty bitch and dealing with her is becomming increasingly difficult. i realized today the ability my mother has to sevierly bring down my mood, it's like i talk to her and i become grumpy and unhappy. i think i need to stop dealing with her and it will be easier. i just don't even want to try anymore, i'll try to make conversation with her by asking how her day was or how her classes are going or whatever and she gives me one word (or very short closed ended) responces and then often procedes to leave the room , which really just makes me feel worse. whats the point? i'm getting sick of trying to be nice to her when it's just bringing me down, she's like a black rain cloud. 

but she's my mom, how can i really justify not talking to her?

ps. telus motem being gay as a result my wireless has been disconnected and i don't have internet in my room for the time being, so i won't be as accessable as usual.

everyone has insecurities about themselves, they look and see that they are not ""ideal girl"" or ""ideal boy"" but realisticly who looks for thoes people? they don't exisist anyways. so everyone lives with their not enough this or that and too much this or that, and thinks that they could never be loved because of their this or thats, and that no one would find them apealing. but then allong comes someone who finds your not enough this or that and too much this or that to be just right this and that. and if our lucky, their not enough this or that and too much this or that, is just right this or that.

"event","after almost 4 weeks of singledom i have found a song that represents my sentaments, and who knew, it was there all along, a song that i've known since grade 4 or 5. Love fool by the cardigans. 
Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know
And maybe there is nothing
that I can do to make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought just stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

So I cry, I pray, and I beg
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry, and I beg for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you


Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake an I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

It's perfection as a set of lyrics for my life, it describes my sentaments etc etc. while type this i'm watching High fedelity, and feeling sappy, as  think this is representative of my life at the moment as well, i pity the fool who reads this actually. but this movie is, amazing, fantastic, and perfect. that is all for now."

ok WHAT THE FUCK WAS SHE THINKING? i only work in the FUCKING FABRIC INDUSTRY you think i would want to go, and if i wasn't talking about it you think oh maybe she doesn't know maybe i could tell her. or oh we mother daughter sew it would be fun to go together, fuck what the hell! honestly had i not see a poster today i would have never know about it till like the last day of it when she came home and went ""man i sure had fun at the sewing show today"" and i would have missed out.

""do you remember that olf TV series, get smart? you remember at the beginning where maxwell smart is walking down the secret coridor and there are all of thoes doors that open sideways, and upsidedown and gateways and stuff? i think that everybody keeps a whole bunch of doors just like this between themselves and the world. But when you fall in love, all of your doors are open, and all of their doors are open. And uou rollerskate down your halls together.

Karla and i fell in love somewhere out there--i think thats the way is happens out there. The two of you start talking about your feelings and your feelings float outside you likr vapors. and they mix together like a fog. Before you realize it, the two of you have become the same mist and you realize you can nevr return to being just a lone cloud again, because the isolation would be intolerable.""

somehow i was reading this and thought that it was one of the best things i had ever read about love. Mike and i have been together 6 months now, if this is the world that eastern religions say it is i must have been pretty fab in my last life to deserve him. i'm going to go off and smile till my face falls off now."

so, during the cold war years the US government took to black balling people and things that were socialist/communist. but then we have the classic fairy tale of robinhood. now tell me, is stealing from the rich and giving to the poor and trying to overthrow the oppressive rulers not a clearly socialist plot? i think it is. yet americans tell this story to their children AND our favorite american animater disney made a cartoon out of it. i think this is odd.

in short americans are idiots because they can't keep their ideologies straight.

"event","ok so i neen everyone's opinion, what do you think is better?

option one: having only one class on monday and friday, that is one hour long, from 1-1:50, keep in mind that it's going to take me an hour plus travling time in each direction

option two: having mondya and friday off but then my tuesday would be 4 lectures straight from 9:30-3:30 and thursday would be from 9:30 till 4:30 straight

in both cases my wednesday is not too buisy, but there isn't anything i can do about that.

pros of #1, the class looks really cool and it's the same prof i have now so i know he's good, but i will be spending about twice as much time on transit than in class, and it's the middle of the day

pros of #2, i'll have a 4 day weekend, and i can then work an 8 hour shift on monday and friday, this way i'll get more hours (prolly about 24-28/week) and i could always use the money, but it means i will have 6/7 hours of straight lecture which would be hardcore (it would be 1.5 hours of logic, then history, then political theory then eastern religion (my poor head!))

so i'm having a tough time trying to decide on this, and my mother isn't making it any easer, she thinks 4 isn't bad and she thinks i dont' really want to be at school as it is, so when i'm trying to pro and con it with her she goes ""well why don't you just take 3 classes and make it really easy on yourself"" bitch, grumble. so i'm looking for as much advice as i can get, i'm kinda leaning towards option 2 just kuz then i can work more, but i'm afraid then i won't be on the ball when it gets to the end of the day (and thats religion! the most fun looking one of them all) and if i'm ever sick then i would have to miss all my classes....so yeah, i need input, and fast people!

wait, thats not the most exciting event in my life! ok so the most exciting event in my life is *drum roll* descovring ""the thrills"" i think i'm in love, ok so i say this about a band every couple of months but still! i think i love then just as much or more than my infatuated episode with the strokes. i mean vintage west cost country rock!? what more could a vintage girl ask for? i think they made that album just for me :D love it love it love it.

the recent good weather has got me feeling fantastic, i wanna go outside and walk more..but i have to do a philosophy essay *groan*"

"event","<P>alright, regarding my comment, i may ahve gotten a bit carried away in the heat of the moment with the latter 2 comments, but thats because i was mighty pissed off. </P>
<P>for the comments on LOTR i was trying to illustrate that it is a classic, not that everyone should love it. take for instance shakespeare i'm not much of a fan, but i'm not going to go arround saying that his works are crap because he is classic, his writings are responsible for the development of the english language, and as a historical look at that time period, because of this i respect shakespeare doesn't mean that i like him though. </P>
<P>and now for the thing about english...</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""the big analogy""> </P>
<P>so lests say that tomorow all english speeking countries, esp thoes in north america are all of a sudden poor, no jobs to be had and the dollar is devistated. we are all in extreme poverty, lets say as well that there is a war here in north america between us and the US over what little resources we have. so we young&nbsp; people are hell bent on having a good life so we move to the big economic countries. we are going to say that this is the middle east (just for fun and arguments sake). now i duno about you but i sure don't speek arabic, and most of you out there with the exception of arabs probably don't speek arabic either, ok mabey the numbers 1-10 or hello or something but not much. keep in mind that english is no longer the language of business and english speeking countries are in disreguard because of the wars here over little natural resources (barbaric i know) not to mention the US formerly being an invasive power. As an english speeker you will always be mistaken for an american even if you are not. </P>
<P>so we go over to...where ever lets pick Iran for fun. we are over there struggling to learn arabic and make due with what we know, because we are stupid westerners, our schooling has no creditability there because we went to inferior schools. so there we are working second&nbsp;rate jobs bearly scrapping by to make enough money for food and shelter.</P>
<P>so we are working our buts off and getting no where we have no education, we don't know the language, we are not advancing in our jobs it's hopeless. and we are being looked down uppon as english speeking americans with a horrible culture. then some random guy is walking arround and we can sorta understand what he is saying kuz we are slowly learning arabic and what we hear is :""i hate working with these damn immigrants who can't even speek arabic! they can't even learn it, they are always mixing it with english why cant thoes damn people just get it right."" </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>now i'm going to throw out a classic little idea at you, teat others as you would like to be treated, how would you feel if it was you? this is why i'm so angry, it's totaly inconsiderate.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>oh also another thing, not&nbsp;getting mad at you leni but, i never said that i was good at english, i know i'm a terrible speller. and i know how hard it can be to work with people that don't know english, i've worked in service as well, but you have to give them props for trying, i know if i was plunked down in some country where i knew nothing about the language that i would be screwed over.</P>"

in other news i've spiffied up this little button down shirt of mine i took out the 3 terribly placed buttons (one at bust line, and 2 more ending like 2 inches above my belly button) honest whom ever made that shirt was like, ohhh little girls should pay loads of money to wear like no clothes. but yeah, so i took out the buttons and replaces it with hook and eye tape, hot. if a guy ever wants to take that shirt off me, we should hope he is mighty tallented ;) heh

what else to write about....well this was a pointless post about weather and my shirt...yikes i have sunk this low...i'm going to trudge off to school now, tata."

-boys are silly creatures that i cannot help but be attracted to
-i'm really not that bad at pool, like 5 years of not playing and i can still win, go me!
-crazy mad bum dancing in pubs is the funest thing in the world
-i still love walking, even though if you go walking for like 4.5 hours you can get foot ouchies
-there are alot of beautiful things to be seen


ok, thats all i can think of for now, i'm just so darn happy. i wonder how long i can keep this wicked mood? i hope it will last me 24 hours."

"event","oh work, i love you because you pay me (well most of the time you do) but i hate you because you make me tierd. my feet hurt, again. 

my new favorite drink is coke and amereto, it's got the sugar and caffine of coke. and the sexualy sweet aspect of marishino cherries. what could be better.

also i like suttle flirting. esp when you know it's going to go nowhere but you do it anyways. naughty me. 

i really like smiling. and i like watching people smile. esp inner smiles, they feel good and it's good to see someone do it. i also like the kinda smiles that start off as a half side of the mouth smirk and turn into full face smiles, or just the little smirk ones, the kind of smirk smile you get when your being playfully devious.

i really like this song by michel pagliaro. well a couple of his songs really. he's god a neeto voice."

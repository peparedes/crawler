Even though I'm always gone
Doesn't mean I'm not thinking of you all the time
And when is life is getting rough
I imagine us sharing our whole lives.

We could run away
Leave behind anything bigger
Not noing where we're going to stop
When there's no limits.

You're part of me, it's so easy to see.
In the simple truth
When I'm in your arms, I feel safe from harm
And sorrow too
You're part of me, it's so easy to see.
In the simple truth
But most of all, nothing couldn't be solved
When I'm with you

That memory of your smile
Pierces through the dark when I go to bed alone.
And when I'm about to fall apart
I remember your open arms
Waiting for me to come home.

Let's create our own world
Make it up to us, simply an honest
I'll sing a song you've never ever heard
No one else could be

You're part of me, it's so easy to see.
In the simple truth
When I'm in your arms, I feel safe from harm
And sorrow too
You're part of me, it's so easy to see.

"event","wellllllllllll.....heres the events....of this wondeful mid-winter break :o)....

Friday- we havd a half day so i came home took and shower and slept...until jessmica and kevin came over....they come over and we chilled...then kevin went to work and me and jessmica chilled until me, her and kelly went to my daddys...ate dinner there....and played with brian and denises farrets.... left and went to Katies....Nick, Lisa, Katie, Mikey (katies bro), Jessmica and me were all there... me lisa and kelly all chipped in a lil bit to buy some jager..... i got really trashed.... i mean really i took like 10-15 shots of jager..... and i woke up in katies bathroom.....i dont remember too much about that night.....from what i was told... i puked alot and i was like rocking back and fourth...i almost hit my head on the toilet quite a few times.... i guess i hit the bong like 3 times... witch i really regret doing.....but yea... we left katies at 4 (?) and kelly took me nad jessmica to jessmicas and went to sleep

Saturday- kevin came and got me from jessmicas at 10... he dropped me off and went to work....i didnt go back to sleep.....i had the biggest hang over of my life.... at like 1 or 2 i took a shower....then called jessmica...  went there... then we went to jens aunts house fer jens b day.... that was alot of fun.. there was alot of food and such there... i love jens aunt sherry shes so funny!!!!! i fell asleep watching drop dead fred at like 1ish..

Sunday- woke up at about 11 or 12 ish.. ate some food... watched gummo.. fell asleep watching that... woke back up at the end of it....then we left a lil bit later i went to jesmicas....kevin came and got me from there and i think he stayed the night that night... i dunno... 

Monday- woke up at about 2 and i think i got my unseen and casualties tickets on monday

yea i dont really remember much else......... until this weekend....


but yea.. one of the days (i think it was wednesday) ....me, jen, jessmica, josh and kevin all got kicked outta the mall... because josh was playing on the play thing...it was pretty 3 security guards had to escort us out... the whole time they were walking with us we were all being jerks and saying shit like ""dont have fun in the mal theyll kick you out"" and shit like that ...it was pretty funny

then the day after that (witch would be thursday i think) happpend we got kicked outta meijer... but seriously we werent doing anything wrong we were just chillin on the couches and some guy came up to us and was like ""i hate to be the one to tell you this but you guys need to leave the store"" and we got really mad and we knew who it was that told the guy to tell us to leave.. so when we were walking out kevin seen the girl and kevin started freaking out and was like ""what did we do wrong?"" and the lady didnt say anything so kevin was like ""what? whay? right.... NOTHING!"" and we walked away.... and we told the workers that the lady was bad news...then we left.. then we went to k mart... but we didnt get kicked outta there... we jut chiiled... k mart people are diffentaly NOT nazis... there kool in my book... 

and on friday.. me, kevin, jessmica and josh went to sandys... fer the night and chilled with her we went to this hotel.. and played in the arcade... it was fun then after that we went to starbucks and got some high quality drinks.....then we went back to sandys...and watched haggard it was a weird movie...then we just watched the music channels...until forever.... i was the last one up!!! i didnt go to bed until 4:00 or 4:30ish

then saturday we woke up at 11 or 12 i think.... then left sandys at 3? and on the way home kevins car cought on fire and....it was crazy......i was in the back of a cop car fer the first time....but i wasnt in trouble they were just driving us to a rest stop so we could call our parents and geta ride home..... so my mommie came to the rescue and got us all....it was sweet.. but kevin no longer has a car so it kinda sucks.....but whatev... its kool i guess.... then kevin sayed the night and yea 

then i woke up at 1ish and went with my mom at 5 to get kevin from work... then kevin came here for about a hour then his dad came and got him and took him home


i dont think im ever gonna go over my dads again... fer real... my mom told me that he called and was askin my mom if me and kevin have sex and how he wants to take me out to dinner and ask me if me and kevin are having sex and stuff... its so much bull shit.. fer real.. he didnt do this shit with kelly about her and justin.. and they dated for almost 3 years! and me and kevin have been dating for 3 months.....my dad is so fucking stupid....i sware..if he asks me to go out to dinner im gonna keep saying im busy...i dont care if he catches on er whatever...fuck that....he pisses me of way too much.....and its none if his buisness anyways.....

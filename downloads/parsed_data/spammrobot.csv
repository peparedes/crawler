"event","The subject heading is for me.  I don't want to go to my job AT ALL today.  Due to poor planning and a few lazy people, there's this huge backlog of crap that should have been done days ago, in addition to a lot of new projects for today.  This means I'll have to run my ass off, in addition to making sure that everyone else is doing the same.  Sales were for shit yesterday, which always pisses me off when I close, because it makes me feel somehow responsible (although I don't feel all glorious and proud when sales are great when I close, since most of our business is in the daytime).  GRRRRR.  This cannot possibly interest anyone but myself, however, so here:  waste your time with this!  It actually frustrates the hell out of me, but for some reason, I greatly enjoy being frustrated by non-real world problems.  Surely there's been some sort of study on this.  Anyway, I stayed up half the night, and didn't solve these yet, but I will.  Just wait.  Bwaa Haa Haa.

I recommend starting with the crimson room, since its actually the first one made.  Well, enough mindless chatter.  I have to get dressed now.  Today i will wear something nice, because Steph is picking me up to take me for a drink after work.  :)"

"event","here is a lovely website all about working at Barnes & Noble.  It is funny and true.  After you've read it, add on about 3 pages about the crappy/insane/hostile employees i have to manage, and you'll have a remarkably accurate idea of how my days go.

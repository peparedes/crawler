"event","well here's the update on the wonderful life of susan:
work from 9-5 bites ass
mcat studying bites ass
waking up early everyday incl. weekends bites ass
the two stupid ppl in my lab are going to get published in JACS while i might be just in the acknowledgments bites ass
conclusion: life bites ass

on the high note:
initially i was going to just drink for my 21st b-day n go to AC.  But now, i plan to do other stuff. I think i'm going to go flying (yes, fly a small plane) on my bday and then AC later. The night b4 my bday i'll probably head to Dave & Buster's for one hell of a night.  I decided w/the help of some ppl that my 21st should be extremely memorable....flying a plane will do that...lol :)"

The girl who pierced her was really nice...me n jess was talkin and we found it funny that the nicest and most social people are the ones that are pierced and tattooed up like crazy lol....weird...Jess tried to convince me to get a piercing too...but i managed to get away from that...jess said ""next time i'll go with you"" ...i said ""if"" she said ""next"" ...this continued for many minutes lol...."

"event","so i haven't written sum jelly in a while i know that all of you were waiting anxiously... :P
so many things have happened here's the summary

over break:
1. i cleaned, got an oil change for my car, did lots n lots of laundry, went shopping w/my mom, ate a ton of authentic viet food ...yums
2. came back to school early to do sum research....i had to get away from the house...granny was driving me crazy
        I understand that granny is going senile....but she just pisses me off sometimes.....she managed to call me a liar and lazy all in one day within a 2 hr time span.....A liar b/c she asked where my grandfather was and i said ""he died 5 yrs ago""...like i would lie about something like that ...that's just wrong. Lazy b/c i told her to sit up from the couch so i could help her over to the dinner table. She said she couldn't do it but that's  a lie i saw her do it b4...i just didn't want her to keep relying on ppl and also so that she could stretch her own muscles....oy.....god bless that woman...but she drives me crazy sometimes...
3. so i got back her early did some research all day...stupid IR wasn't working right someone screwed up the parameters....so i had to use the bio's FTIR....geez their's suck.
4. That night we decided to go bowling (me, Jess n Laura) out of no where....damn we're good bowlers 323 ppl! lol.....team score hahaha we also decided to get bowling shirts the next day...that night we also played sum kings ....we got drunk n stole the neon green Piso Moyado cones lol.....a pair of them too...we also tagged the school lol in dry erase markers...we're bad but not that bad..We wrote on the board thinking that we were bad asses b/c we thought we weren't supposed to write what ""we believed as a child"" ....but you were allowed to do that!.....attempt to be bad = failed....
5. The next day we went to the mall looking for shirts n stuff...but ended up w/nice jackets to get embroidery on.  ....attempt to find an embroidery place = failed.... went to KFC n pigged out ...we got ridiculously large cups of soda....dunno y...lol ...we also found an embroidery shop on mainline...but it was closed
6. It's friday n we went to the embroidery shop....asians own it of course...we got  a great deal...i should've told her i was korean to get a discount lol...oh well.......our jackets are hot by the way! ....

i am behind on all of my work ....yet i just don't care that much :/"

"event","so after spending a day w/the family & my dad's ex-girlfriend plus her family n kids....yes it was weird....but apparently my parents were really cool with everything....i went out to dinner w/Alice, Tuan and Matt.  The funniest moment had to be when alice decided to go outside to get Tuan by(walking as well as slightly pushing) a locked door which made her fall back...lol....Then we headed back to Alice's place b/c i wanted to check it out.  Tuan kept saying sit on Alice's bed...so i did ...Awesome bed Alice lol...now i know why everyone kept talking about it......so then me and alice headed back to the apartment to find it full of drunken roommates...I STAYED SOBER!!!!!!!!! i deserve a big ass cookie! lol..see i'm not an alcoholic......n e way...i've been dying to see ""Hitch"" and did w/Thaoie....I pushed over the nachos midway in the film on her by accident lol....thank god for processed cheese lol it stayed in the container hahahaha....gross...but no stains!....

So here's the critique on the movie.....i know you all are dying to read about it:

Will Smith is a great actor in it lol...it was really good. Definitly worth while to watch in a movie theatre....i'm going to own this movie damn it! It was an extreme chick flick + comedy.  I don't want to give out all of the details b/c that will just ruin the movie.  The funniest part ....there were multiple...does it live up to the expectations? YES! By the way...if you do go watch this movie keep in mind that Charles is MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.....is he that hot? helllllllllllll YEA... i'd do him if he asked....shoot i'd be his hoe i don't care lol......why aren't there any charles around here? i want his babies lol....."

"event","so i've been tryin to put up another log but it keeps tellin me to come back later....well it works now. I just finished off the night watchin Saw w/Cat and Jess.  Weird movie I must say but good.  I was sooo disappointed I wanted the guy to die.  I don't want to be too detailed just in case anyone else wants to see it.  A MUST SEE scary movie.  

so this week has been basically hell for me lol.
It began w/a movie: 40 Days and 40 nights....now Jess and Cat won't stop makin fun of me.....damn u's lol 
Then I had quizes n shit like that that I know i f'uped.  Then i had a 10 pg paper due that i didn't really do lol. But before that, in research lab i hurt myself.  Well i shall claim that ""Dr. Bessel attacked me lol"" but i don't know how long that will hold up.  I can't believe after 3 yrs of the stupid safety video that I friggin hurt myself w/a thermometer.  
For all of you who didn't know what had happend here's the story:
                   I was using perfectly good lab techniques to put the thermometer into the cap but it was too tight.  The thermometer then broke in half in my palm and left a cut.  Dr. Bessel was freakin lol and then she called VEMS.  A security guard came up w/a massive kit and pulled out a bandaid for my boo boo lol.  People emptied their laboratories to see what happened.  Other VEMS ppl arrived...you probably would've thought someone had a heart attack or something.  Then I went back to research and eventually class.....Almost EVERYONE heard about it :/ .....sad i must say....but i guess stupid things like this are bound to happen at least once in your life time."

"event","A white woman, about 50 years old, was seated next to a black man. Obviously disturbed by this, she called the Airline Hostess. Madam, what is the matter, the hostess Asked. You obviously do not see it then? She responded. You placed me next to a black man. I do not agree to sit next to someone from such a repugnant group. Give me an alternative seat. Be calm please, the hostess replied. Almost all the places on this flight are taken. I will go to see if another place is available. The Hostess went away and then came back a few minutes later. Madam, just as I thought, there are no other available seats in the economy class. I spoke to the captain and he informed me that there is also no seat in the business class. All the same, we still have one place in the first class. Before the woman could say anything, the hostess continued. It is not usual for our company to permit someone from the economy class to sit in the first class However, given the circumstances, the captain feels that it would be scandalous to make someone sit next to someone sooooo disgusting. She turned to the black guy, and said. Therefore, Sir, it would be our pleasure if you would take your hand luggage and come with me because a seat awaits you in the first class. At the moment, the other passengers who were shocked by what they had just witnessed stood up and applauded. This is a true story which is not usually told. If you are against racism, please send this message to all your friends, Please do not delete it without sending it to at least one person"

Last nite was crazy I woke up this morning at around 6:45 with a slight headache...so of course asprin was in order.  I have no clue when the last few ppl left yesterday.  The party was alright it could have been better though.  My old highschool friends left early, I was a bit disappointed but then again they have a long drive.  

The jello shots were hot!  I have no clue how many drinks i actually had...that's not too good lol...  The funniest part of the nite had to be:

When we were playin kings and it was a rhyme: park; dark and kim answered ""purple"" ahahhahaha
Cat made me laugh and I spit all the alcohol i had in my mouth on her....she retaliated w/throwing her drink on me....oy lol...

hmmm....if u guys remember anything else be sure to add it...cuz my mind's a blank right now...

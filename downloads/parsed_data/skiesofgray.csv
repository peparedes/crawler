I don't know if i can handle another six weeks of winter, <STRONG>YIKES</STRONG>! So school was alright, we sat on the ""south side"" of the cafeteria today... it was mighty quiet... and then! this kid just came and sat with us! i was weirded out, but i was nice to him and i talked to him. lol. Geom was exciting as usual, there's something about being with kari for a whole 90 minutes and sitting next to her that just makes us go CRAZY we are honestly bouncing off the walls.. and NO! that was not a lesbian intended comment! I usually spark the entertainment for the period... lol. So yea! janet jackson's boob.... just hanging out there? wardrobe malfunction?

"event","<P>what a music-filled weekend it has been! sorry i haven't written... i forgot i made this when i was bored, and then last week i was caught up in the fact that it was a new semester, and new things that come along with it! ((like new hw...)) so yea! Fri... nora my sweethart fellow manager and i attempted to go to the boys' swim meet.. well we got there with my expertise of directing her, lol. but then we decided we wanted food, but i wanted real food and nora just wanted coffee or like stuff from a one stop or something of that sort. So... we explored the shopping centers and then after 10 mins of nothing we liked, we spotted a mc donalds! So we got some food... then headed off.. Then! this stupid garbage truck was like on fire or something so we had to go around him and that made us late... then i forgot to tell nora where the entrance was to park, which made us later... then we blew a stopsign right in front of the police station, then the light was really long, then finally! we made it to the swim meet! Mc Donald's and all! Mon was worried i think..... </P>
<P>then after the swim meet... brian jp and i ventured to devin's show, which we missed him play, SORRY! and i fed the boys pizza, and i had to pay for jp to get in...but we had a good time anyways seeing all the other bands play. not my style, but lemme just say they were definitly talented!!!!!!!!!!! then on the way home, stephen was wtih us too, and we blasted cute without the e, and then quiet things that no one knows.... and it was definitly v~show all over again... with me bustin out at the top~! LOL </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>then yesterday.... nora and i went to the boys' swim practice to see aidan! wat a hottie! back off he's 18 months! but it was kinda scary cuz my favorite freshman of all time, matt o'brien hit his head on the diving board!!! we were scared because we thought he hit his eye, but he really hit his cheekbone... it was not a pretty site... then i went out to breakfest with nora nate jp and trevor at cna.. where else! then.... i came home, got my new plates for my car, got my eyebrows done... then.. jackie and i went to the academy show and met up with aaron and josh there! then saw some other cool cats... and it was a lovely night....</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>tonight.. i am venturing over to erik's for a ""super bowl party"" hell yea!!! lol </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>more later...</P>

you're just jealous cause i'm young and in love.
your stomach's filled up but you're starved for conversation.
you're spending all your nights growing old in your bed.
and you're tearing up your photos cause you want to forget...
it's over."

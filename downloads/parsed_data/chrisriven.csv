"event","With any luck, this will be my last ever entry about Nicole. I'd like to cut that whole world entirely out of my life. But I have to get this off my chest.

I feel misused. Or maybe not entirely misused, but definitely misled towards a less than wonderful end. Apparently Nicole and I are NOT going out, and apparently we never were. A great man once said, if something had already been said best, don't try to do better, just use what you have. So, I'm not going to describe the whole thing. I'll just copy and paste.

Nicole: lol then we can hang out 
SearedLuminosity: now I'm not one to push my luck, but what do you say I ask you out for another date?
Nicole: lol ..... just outta curiosity(sp)  what is your definition of date?
SearedLuminosity: two people getting together to enjoy each others company. Not necessarily boyfriend and girlfriend, but possibly more than just friends?
Nicole: umm yea well
Nicole: idk 
SearedLuminosity: well, anything you're willing to say on the matter I'd be willing to hear
Nicole: h/o
SearedLuminosity: sure thing
Nicole: hey sorry
Nicole: k
SearedLuminosity: k
SearedLuminosity: we don't have to talk about it now if you don't want to
Nicole: I didnt really realize what the difference between a date and just hanging out was... but  then it started to sound like I agreed to go out with you which was cleared up .... but by your definition it sounds like if I say yes to a date it will eventually turn in to .... for lack of better word ....dating...and I'm not promising ne thing nor do I want to lead a person on
SearedLuminosity: ok
Nicole: lol
Nicole: I""m not done yet
SearedLuminosity: i understand
SearedLuminosity: oh, all right
SearedLuminosity: I'll wait
Nicole: I dont mind the occational date like if we were to hang out with a bunch of couples ex. karens parties..... or if we were to go to the movies with a bunch of couples but other wise idk
SearedLuminosity: ok
SearedLuminosity: I guess I was just hoping that what you said last year ""I won't be ready to date for a while, but maybe sometime"" was what was going on. And I didn't really think there were other definitions of the word date, so you can understand the mix up.
Nicole: ok 
SearedLuminosity: can I ask something?
Nicole: sure
SearedLuminosity: do you think you'll ever have feelings for me? like, do I have anything to offer you that you would want in a boyfriend?
SearedLuminosity: or is it pretty much completely out of the question?
SearedLuminosity: don't worry about sparing me or anything. Just tell me the truth
Nicole: idk and I'm actually going through that same thing w/ someone else..... your a nice guy and u treat me wonderful but idk
SearedLuminosity: all right, I guess I can take that
SearedLuminosity: well, I'm tired
SearedLuminosity: ttyl
Nicole: ok bye bye
Session Close

She's tried to IM me twice, and yes, I have ignored her both times. I don't know what I'd say. But here, in my journal, I know what to say. She said she didn't want to lead me on. But the more I think about it, the more I feel led on. I could understand, possibly, letting me hold her hand, letting me hold her close during a movie, even getting under a blanket together and holding close while watching a movie alone together, IF THERE WAS ONLY FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN US. But she knows how I feel. I've made it way more than clear on many occasions how I feel about her and what I want between us. And doing those things and letting those things happen is a bad way not to lead somebody on. And even if I'm over exagerating the events that took place as far as importance goes, the plain and simple fact that she accepted to go on a date with me is terrible. Somebody said to me ""Well yeah, there are definitely different meanings of the word date. But still, no one should accept to go on a date, even a friedly one, with a person they have no intention of ever dating. It just isn't right."" And finally, I don't think she could have misconstrued what I had interpreted the situation as. I asked her if I could take her on a date, and she said yes. I was surprised and made it more than clear how jubilent and excited I was that she had accepted. I don't think it was confusable as to what I thought ""date"" meant, and if she had no intention of letting it turn into that and she didn't want me to think what I did, she should have told me then and there. Just in my opinion.

A final note about the whole charade is actually about Amanda G. The following is an excerpt from a conversation I had with her after Nicole said yes.

Fae In Hiding: ??
SearedLuminosity: I...
SearedLuminosity: asked nicole out again
Fae In Hiding: does it have to do wit
Fae In Hiding: nvm
Fae In Hiding: ok
Fae In Hiding: yea
Fae In Hiding: n she said yes
SearedLuminosity: yeah, I guess she did
Fae In Hiding: see i read ure lj just now
Fae In Hiding: and then i saw her comment n was like omg
Fae In Hiding: cuz im smart like that
SearedLuminosity: lol
Fae In Hiding: so, u r happy right
SearedLuminosity: I guess that's what I should be, right?
Fae In Hiding: yes but i can understand ure confusion n such
Fae In Hiding: would u b mad if i sadi i knew she would say yes
SearedLuminosity: there's a chance
Fae In Hiding: uh ok then i didnt
SearedLuminosity: I would still want to know though
Fae In Hiding: oh
Fae In Hiding: well awhile ago like during break maybe
Fae In Hiding: i dont totally remember when
Fae In Hiding: it was either thanksgiving yea i think it was
Fae In Hiding: she said she liked u n wanted u to ask her again
Fae In Hiding: n i think i tried to tell u w/o actually telling u cuz she asked me not to actually tell u
SearedLuminosity: did she say anything about why she changed her mind?
Fae In Hiding: umm
Fae In Hiding: possibly?
Fae In Hiding: i dont remember
Fae In Hiding: i was all OMG

So... there we have it. What in the hell do I make of that? Is amanda a liar? Is Nicole a liar? Are games being played with me by one party or another? Who do I trust, who do I apologize to, who do I go on avoiding for the rest of my natural life? That's why this whole charade is over. That's why I can't keep talking to Nicole. I will lose my mind, my heart and my soul if I keep putting so much of me into something that I will never have, now matter how hard I try and no matter how close I seem to get.

So, if these are my last words to you, let me make them breif and straigh forward. I'm sorry for messing up and wasting so much of your life Nicole. I'm sorry I just don't have what you want. I'm sorry I'll never be able to be the guy for you. But what I'm not sorry for is this last pathetic attempt at our friendship/what ever the fuck you want to call it. I'm not sorry because just like that last day in the hallway and every other day before, I cared for you. I cared what happened to you, who was hurting you, what I could do to make things right again. I wanted to be a bright light in your life. But I feel led on. I feel like you let me burn brightly and have real hope that something good was finally coming of all the pain I'd gone through to be with you, and then you just extinguished me. In simplest words, I FEEL LED ON, no matter what your true intentions were. I'll never be able to be your friend, because that's never where I'll want to be. I won't ever understand your taste in men, and I won't ever be able to sit on the sidelines again while you have a relationship with some other guy. I can't do that anymore. I'm sorry that it has to end this way, but it has to end. Every day knowing how I felt about you but realizing it would never work was another day of my life wasted in agony and self-doubt during high school, and I can't put myself through that any longer. I'm sorry I can't be a better person, but even if I was, it probably wouldn't be right for you anyway, would it?
Good-bye."

"event","Quite a while since that day. Since the day in the hallway, since she looked at me, confused, and said she had to think about it. Quite a while since that day she came into the cafeteria and told me no, we could only be friends, she wanted to go to the prom alone, and I walked out on her. God that hurt. It probably hurt her too, that I just walked away like that. But at the time, I could hardly give a damn. That fucking hurt me. I don't know and can't know and probably never will know what it felt like to her, but I have a pretty vivid memory of what it felt like to me. Quite a while since those days. Quite a while since we stopped talking all together.

Only a couple of weeks since we started going out though.

Holy God Damn Freaking Shit Crap. I'm messed up in the fucking membrane over this freaking nonsense. A few months after school started, we started speaking again, her and I, through AIM. It was a big step though. We started joking around again, being friendly, talking about new things, current events, forgetting the past. Out of sight, out of mind, right? We spoke for a few months, and then we agreed to do something over christmas break. First thing to note: I told her I missed her. She said she missed me too. However, I still said it first. And almost as a reflex. I honestly don't even think I considered whether or not I ACTUALLY missed her. So we got together over christmas break, went to see ""spanglish"" in the danbury theater. At some point during the movie, I acted like my same old idiotic self, and I stretched my hand forward and brushed it against hers. Now, I knew exactly what I was doing and what I wanted to come of it, but of course I made out like I had just been stretched. After I had brushed my hand against hers, I turned my eyes to her and gave one of those ""whoops"" looks. She just smiled though, so I smiled back, and then I took her hand in mine. We watched the rest of the movie like that, hand in hand. I dropped her off at her home later that evening, and walked her to her door, as I have done so many countless times before. We had our kicks and giggles, told eachother how much we had enjoyed the movie, said our goodbyes, and then hugged. But it wasn't uncomfortable or fake like I'd anticipated. It was just like all the hugs we'd had before those days, before our falling out. It was nice.

So, then we get to a few weeks ago. Speaking on AIM, which had become much more frequent recently, we spoke of doing something the next time I would be back in town. It so happens I have a weeklong break from school coming up, which I told her about. Back in High School, it had become very common place for me to make uncomfortable jokes about her liking me, or asking her out on hypothetical dates. I'm sure there's some pychological explanation for it, some need for validation of my worth. Yet I digress. So we were speaking, and she said it would be nice to do something over break. So, in my usual idiotic way, I said, ""mind if we consider it a date?"" And she said, ""sure.""
I had a major doubletake at this and said something like ""Whoa, wait, hold up. What did you say?"" She laughed a little and said yes again.

Amanda G told me a day or two after that she knew Nicole had changed her mind. Something to the effect of ""Would you be mad if I told you I knew she'd say yes? She's been telling me for about a month that she liked you now and wanted you to ask her out again.""

So, now we're together. For all intents and purposes, at least.

Here's where I start having issues.
1. I don't know how I feel about her changing her mind like that. I got crushed last year. It hurt. I know it did. Because it happened to me. And I'm me. So I know what it was like. Etc. You get the point. So now, she wants me. I think the nagging thing that's getting to me is mostly that I can't tell why she would change her mind. Is she realizing that people have left carmel, maybe her friends aren't as loyal as she once thought they were? Is she reconsidering how I felt about her and how she felt about me back in those days? Is she thinking maybe I really did care about her, and Steve didn't, and not a lot of people do now? And if so, is it for me to go back and be the rock to steady her in turbulance. I don't mean to make that sound as bad as it probably sounds. I don't mean to make this into a vengeance thing: ""She wouldn't have me when I wanted her, so I won't have her when she wants me."" That's not it, I don't think. Damn I hope not.
2. Do I still harbour the feelings for her that I know I felt back then? Is it going to be now what I was hoping for it to be like back then? Is there anyway I'll be able to get close to her without reoccuring memories of the way we ended back then?
3. Can I even handle a relationship right now? Especially something as potentially serious as this? ESPECIALLY a long distance relationship; with her. Until this happened, I felt like I had at least a few things in order. Still several things in my life to work out, but I was on my way. And now things feel disheveled. This has been the only thing on my mind for two weeks. And it's driving me crazy.
4. Considering how much I'm thinking about it and writing about it and worrying over it, is there even a chance for it to work out in the end.
5. Is there any easy way out at this point? It doesn't seem so to me.

I'll probably come back and write more soon. I don't think I'm done freaking out about this yet."

"event","We set up for filming after school on Thursday. Steve tried to stick around at first, and we couldn't use the room we had intended to, so I was very, very nervous. I handed her the script, Michele and Amanda walked out to ""go get some things"" and made Steve leave so we could film in peace. I told her to read over the script, and while she started I sat down in the stair well a few feet from her and just wrote in notebook. Just about how I was feeling, about what was happening, about how terribly anxious I was.

God, how long she took to read that letter. So long. I've heard talk of time dragging out when one is in an emotionally draining situation, but I never could have imagined what it would have actually been like. I sat there, and waited, and heard those pages turn. And turn, and turn. More pages were flipped over than dialogue was actually written on. She later explained to me that she had been flipping through at first, but when the script seemed to not actually be what she thought it was, she had gone back and started over. So I waited while she read. Finally, she came over and sat down across from me. And she didn't say anything for a long time. Then she said she didn't know what to say. Then she asked ""Why me? Why do you love ME?"" And her lip quivered a little bit, and my eyes watered. And she hugged me. Then she said she had a lot of thinking to do, got her bag and walked out.

That was Thursday. Friday, Saturday and Sunday, barely heard a peep from her or saw her.

Monday came, we talked in second period. And she said she wasn't going with anyone to prom, and it looked like she was ready to cry. And she asked if I really had a date to prom or not. I said yes, but my date had said that she'd be happy to step down to let me go with the girl I loved. Nicole said she had some more thinking to do, but she'd let me know before the end of the day. She did let me know before the end of the day...

Again she said she wasn't going to Senior Ball with anyone, and that's the closest I ever saw her come to tears. I think I might have asked her what she wanted, and she said she thought she wanted to go stag. She said that last year she had wanted to go with Steve and it had gotten messed up, and this year she had wanted to go with Steve, but it had gotten messed up. Then she looked right at me and said ""I love you as a friend."" Straight forward response. So I hugged her and told her I was going to buy Ball tickets for me and my date. And that was the end of it.

What scares me is that I spent so much time on it. Nothing in my life took more effort, happiness or pain than my relationship with Nicole, how ever you look at it. And I seriously thought that it was going to end happily. But after that day, after that hug and walking away... I don't know if I can ever look at her again. There's no safety line anymore. I can't hide behind the facade of friendship. With school over and her going away, I think we're just going to slip away from each other. I can't and probably won't be able to look at her again. And it's killing me. 

Nothing else that went into the journal before or goes into it after will ever be any worse than these three entries. I'm going to be emotionally out of commission for a while. Bye emotions."

"event","Nicole turned me down. Again. It was the final, extreme, ""stop trying"" type of turn down. And I was really silly enough to think it would work out.

See, apparently Steve cheated on her. And apparently she didn't want to believe it. Now, both of those are rumors, and unconfirmed. But everything following is not rumor, as it really did happen. 

CurtainCall17: ure in love with nicole
CurtainCall17: please save her
CurtainCall17: in the name of love
CurtainCall17: i dont mean to sound retarded 
CurtainCall17: but omg please
SearedLuminosity: :-(
CurtainCall17: u 2 should be together
SearedLuminosity: I want it so much
SearedLuminosity: but I'm so scared of her
CurtainCall17: ure scared of a tiny lil girl
SearedLuminosity: I'm scared of what it would mean to try
SearedLuminosity: again
SearedLuminosity: and again
SearedLuminosity: and again
SearedLuminosity: and the response never changes
CurtainCall17: ok, dave
CurtainCall17: u love her, no
CurtainCall17: be honest
SearedLuminosity: I don't know. If the strongest emotion that one has ever felt is love, then yes
SearedLuminosity: I love
SearedLuminosity: And I want to be loved
CurtainCall17: ok, thats a yes
CurtainCall17: so, is it worth fighting for?
SearedLuminosity: hell yes
CurtainCall17: good answer
CurtainCall17: ok then
CurtainCall17: wtf r u waiting for
SearedLuminosity: I'm not waiting for anything
SearedLuminosity: but what are the chances she's going to be with me?
CurtainCall17: idk
SearedLuminosity: she's never showed any interest
CurtainCall17: do something big
SearedLuminosity: and if I try again, I may push her too far away to ever get her back
CurtainCall17: again i ask, is it worth it

More debate and conversation ensues, followed by ""the plan"":

CurtainCall17: u could write her a letter, have us(the 4 from myth) pretend its a script, right
CurtainCall17: so we stay after, and u hand her the ""script"" 
CurtainCall17: and we stand there and let her read her ""lines"" to herself as practice
CurtainCall17: and when she realizes, me and michele leave
CurtainCall17: and u talk to her
SearedLuminosity: answer me something?
SearedLuminosity: do you think she really wants or needs to be with me?
CurtainCall17: needs
CurtainCall17: deff needs
CurtainCall17: wants
CurtainCall17: hmm
CurtainCall17: yea
CurtainCall17: but idk if shes accepted that yet
SearedLuminosity: has she said anything to make you think that
CurtainCall17: but thats what me talking to her thro the day is for
CurtainCall17: dave
SearedLuminosity: anything that can give me a little, tiny piece of confidence here?
CurtainCall17: ive known her since 8th grade
SearedLuminosity: ok
CurtainCall17: i know her
CurtainCall17: and she needs u
CurtainCall17: and she wants u but is still stuck on the fact that she ""shouldnt"" cuz of steve, eww

We talked about it some more, I gave in and decided to go through with it, and I started writing the script. You read this, and you think what you will. But laugh in my presence about it, and I WILL kill you. I'll put it in the next entry so I don't pass my text limit."

"event","Yeah, my class chose to do ""The Great Pandemonium"" for our end of the year play. Pretty funny piece. And I didn't get the lead role. Cory did. Which is a completely understandable and even good choice for the role. But I didn't get Oz either. Or Richard. Or any of the other characters for that matter. I didn't get a single part for the play. And yeah, I am kind of pissed. I mean, I try to deny it for modesty's sake, but I think I'm a really good actor. Maybe not better than, but at least on par with, any other person in that class, at least as far as I've been able to tell from the things we've done in class. And everyone loved Cory's and my duet scene, and Mrs. Trach gave us the best performance award, and she gave me best male actor. I guess I just figured people would vote for me to be in the cast, on stage. What Mrs. Trach ended up doing was taking the left over actors and actresses who wanted parts but didn't get them, and she assembled a second cast. So the first cast will get to do two shows, and the second will do the other one. She didn't want people getting left out I guess. How sweet. Sympathy. You know I love it. Sarcasm. You know, I really, really wanted to be on the cast of our final play. And to me, being in the cast of left overs is generally the same thing as being completely denied the part. God, when Mrs. Trach posted the roles and I read the sheet and didn't see my name, I thought I was just going to lose it right there in the hallway. I just thought I was going to make it. I really thought I had proved myself to the class. So this doesn't exactly help me out. I mean, ""I"" think I'm a good actor, but if I don't get positive feedback, then it justs makes me wonder if I really am. On a disappointment scale of 1 to 10 (one being finding out that the machine is out of pop-tarts, and ten being finding out that my girlfriend of six years has decided she doesn't want to marry me, doesn't want kids and is having an affair with seventeen of my co-workers and four of my relatives) this probably ranks about a 6 in the books. It's another one of those silly things I wish didn't bother me so much, but it does, you know? I really, really wanted to have an important role in the final piece of my favorite class in the last year of High School. And I feel like crap. Stupid allergies to pollen I didn't know I had."

"event","Thanks JR, I know what to do now. Time to spend some more time bitching about my job, or my prom date. Gotta whine a little more about how people don't treat me right or how bad things are for me. Have to sit here messing around on my laptop, trying to look cool playing movies and listening to music and showing off to no one, especially since no one cares. I'm so damn cool, and everyone should aspire to be just like me. I'm the man.

God damn it. How can it seem like everything is working out so wonderfully, and then a few words from a few people can make it a feel like it's all falling apart? If I could just get into people's minds, just know what people think of me. All I want to be is likeable. All I want is to be liked. Everything I do seems to drive people away from me though. Some people think I'm snobby about things I can do or things I have. Stop showing off your computer, it's annoying. You know, you're not THAT good of a writer. You're not THAT good of an actor. Stop bragging, stop pointing out other people's flaws. Where do you get the nerve, you self involved prick? Why don't you stop pretending to be better than everyone else.

(Randomly assorted screams and shouts) Why does everyone immediatly assume that things are filled with innuendos and underlying hints and messages? I'm never trying to offend anyone, I'm never trying to hurt anyone, and God knows I'm NEVER trying to do anything that would make anyone not like me. I say and do stupid things once in a while, but usually those things are a pure result of people saying or doing things to me that I simply can't handle. I can't handle confrontation, I can't handle fighting, I can't handle people having a problem with me and not knowing how to fix it. Not knowing if it is even something I should waste my time trying to fix. But I do, because ALL I WANT is friends.

I'm sorry I'm trying to find something solid and real in my life and be close enough to someone that I'm not scared out of my mind that the next thing I say or do is going to drive them away from me. I apologize for wanting to have and to hold and to be held and loved, and for doing only what I could see to do at the time to try to get that.  In any case, I can't stand the fact that I'd take verbal assualts and behind-my-back mockery for my actions.

I just want people to be straight with me. I want my friends to really be my friends or stop lying to me and leave. I want the people who sincerely have a problem with me not to make me the center of their jokes. I just want everything to be wonderful again, and not have to worry about the thousands of possible things going on just out of my ear shot. I don't want to bother myself with what might be said or who's saying it, and I don't want to question if people are playing it straight with me. It never happens that way though. There's always the questioning, the wondering, the worrying. 

So, I'm sorry I complain. I'm sorry I bitch. I'm sorry that I ""bring my computer into 2nd period and show videos or something"" simply because I don't know any thing else I can do to fit in with that crowd. Forgive me, I didn't mean to be better than you. Because obviously I am better, considering these deep set emotional problems and horribly low self esteem. Thanks all, this has been a wonderful day."

"event","And you know what? Another thing. Junior prom. Ashley Schlicting, or however you spell it. I can't believe that shit. Rich Lande and Dom Iacovelli told me to ask her to prom. And I really, really wanted to go with someone. So I asked. And she said yes. And I was happy, because until then I hadn't possessed a single drop of self-confidence, and no one had ever said yes to a date or anything of the kind. So I asked, and she said yes. After her other option didn't work out, of course. But she said yes, and that's what matters. We went to the prom, and it was great. We were early, and we sat down at a table with her friends. Not my friends, not anyone I felt comfortable talking to or who felt comfortable talking to me, but her friends. And that was okay. Because we didn't really talk either. And everyone came to the prom, and we sat in silence. And the food came, and we sat and ate in silence. And the music came, and I sat in silence. I say I sat in silence because that's what happened. She had gone off with a friend. So I waited for her to come back. And I waited. And I waited. I spotted her a couple of times out on the dance floor, squirming around with some other guys here and there. Eventually, I got tired of waiting for her to come back and eventually walked off to find other people. I didn't really know anyone though, so I got a nice hard kick in the face and had to sit with a group of total strangers I didn't know. That actually didn't turn out too badly. I met Virginia Unger and Michael Kwan, and a couple of other people that I'm sure were there but I can't remember. But I didn't see my date again. Oh wait, yeah I did. I actually pushed my way onto the dance floor during a slow song and actually TOOK her into a dance. At first it was all right, sort of. But then I started noticing her looking up or away from me, towards other guys passing by mostly. I mean, it's not like I was expecting her to sign a vow of fidelity to me or anything, but I think it would have been really nice if she could have curtailed her fucking desires for the length of that one damn song. No such luck though. Anyway, prom ended, and we drove back to the High School for the after prom party. We barely got in the door before she found one of her friends and ran off ""to the bathroom."" At this point I was getting pretty disappointed, or angry, or depressed, or whatever emotion I was experiancing. What ever it was, it was getting worse by this point. So I walked around, talked with some people, at some food, played some games in the gym. Then I came back to the cafeteria and sat by myself to watch the video that had just been made of prom. Just little snippets of the dancing, people walking around, and people getting their prom pictures taken. And guess what I was just lucky enough to walk right in on? As I started watching the video, one of the first things I saw was my date, standing to get her picture taken with another guy. Yes, the pictures, on of the major events of prom, the solid piece of tangible memory to bring home, and she was getting another set taken with another guy. You know what that made me feel like? Well, actually, it just made me feel used. ""Yeah, thanks for the ride and my EXPENSIVE FUCKING TICKET, but when I look back on this night I'd prefer to remember being with another guy."" So I went down to the gym and pounded the shit out of the volleyball for a good half hour or so. Then she actually came to find me. And know what she wanted? ""Can you open your car? I'd like to get my things out of there so I can go with my friends to another party. This is boring."" Yeah, and thanks for a lovely evening bitch, it was so much more pleasant and eventful for me. Anyway, she left, I went back to kicking the volleyball as hard as I could (which was actually pretty damn hard) into the opposite wall, and then I just stayed in the gym the rest of the night. Right until 3 or 4 in the morning. Other than Michele and Sean, I was the last person to leave. I drove out to Wendy's, picked up a meal of some sort, then drove down to the lake and sat down right near the water, just eating my horrible heart clogging food and listening to the calm and wonderful sounds of a peaceful lake and no real traffic on the road. Yeah, it was terrible. Yeah. Fin."

"event","Ok, first order of business. I hate Jessica Romanello. I mean, I don't hate people or things. I just don't. I don't think it's right, and hating others only makes me feel really bad about myself. But what she did was seriously FUCKED UP. I mean, when I explain it, everyone is going to be like, what the fuck is he complaining about. That's such a stupid reason to be angry. I am though. Okay, so I talked to Jamie Schurich in law class, and I was already pretty attracted to her. Then I saw her in the hallway, and I stopped her and asked if she'd like to do something sometime. It sounded better than that, but I don't feel like trying to quote myself from memory. So she said that would be nice. And she thought about her schedule and said she'd see when she was going to have time. So I went home, happy and satisfied. I had a nice day. The next day, I didn't bring it up until the end of the day, because she hadn't said anything about it. And she said that the day she thought she'd have time didn't look clear anymore. So I said ok, we can try for some other time. She said sure. The next day (shit, angry memory) I was outside tossing around a frisbee with a couple of guys right outside the cafeteria. And a kid I know by face and not by name (I only know that he hands out with that whole group, Barry, Keith, Jess, Jamie, Brendon, etc.) came out and handed me a folded napkin with something written on the inside. He told me it was from Jamie. Now, I'm not a rocket surgeon or anything, but I knew it wasn't, and probably couldn't have been from Jamie. So I stuck it in my pocket with out reading it and just tried to enjoy frisbee for a little while. Eventually, I was stricken with a great need to know what it was, regardless of it's origin. So I read it. It was a series of four questions, ""written by Jamie"", each followed by a ""yes"" and a ""no"" for circling purposes. Do you like me? Do you want to fuck me? Do you want to kiss me on the lips? I guess there's a shadow of a doubt that it was Jess who wrote it, but I know for a fact that she sits with that group during that period, and I know she has really nice (generally female) hand writing. The note had very nice (generally female) hand writing. But I'm 99.7668490392290439483 percent sure Jess wrote it, possibly with the jeering laughter of her peers egging her on. Jamie may have been there too (I never bothered to go inside after I got the note), as she made a point of telling me in our last class together that she most certainly didn't write that note. At least she had the decency to attempt and preserve her self image in my eyes. At least she's human. Anyway, ""I didn't write that"" I just asked her straight out ""Are you actually interested, or am I wasting my time? I like you but I don't want to be led on."" And Jamie just said that she was in fact interested in another guy, and she apologized. So I said it was ok, turned and walked off. And you know what, that's okay. I'm fine with that. But Jess FUCKING PISSED ME OFF! And anyone who was at that table and took part in writing that. I mean, if I had just been let down, jesus christ, fine. But they straight out took FUCKING PLEASURE in the prior knowledge that I liked Jamie but she didn't like me. They knew she didn't, and they actually got amusement from poking fun at me. I can't stand it. It's insufferable. Ok, now you can laugh if you must, but don't comment on this or try to make me feel better about it. I don't need to feel better about it. I just needed to tell that story. I just needed to let of some steam. Fin.

Edit to this entry made on 6/15/04: I don't hate Jessica Romanello. I actually think she's a very nice young girl. I won't delete the entry entirely because it's something I once thought, and I'm not going to pretend nothing ever happened. We actually talked about it a little bit though, and she apologized to me. What happened was that she and the others at her table had actually been poking fun at Jamie because someone liked her, not because they were being mean, but just the silly little ""ha, somebody likes you"" type of thing. I guess they weren't thinking that me getting the note was going to have any effect on me, but they didn't intend for it to. I also apologized for being an ass and writing about her, because I really freaked out way too much considering, even for what I thought was the case originally. So, it's past us now, I believe, she wrote a very nice entry in my yearbook and gave me her contact information. I think maybe I'll give her a call one day and maybe just talk. It'd be nice to be on speaking terms with her, since that's all I ever really wanted. Edit complete."

"event","Chris is back at skool today. That makes me happy. When I got to his house this mornin to pick him, I didn't even get inside the door b4 he gave me a HUGE hug. It was nice. The whole time that I was there, he just smiled & smiled & smiled. I finally said, ""You seem happy today."" He said, ""I am happy. I haven't seen you in 3 days!!"" It was cute. He's so cute. He makes me smile. So yeah. 

Caleb called me last nite. We didn't really get to talk b\c we were both busy doin stuff & then I never called him back. Like, he called me 1st when I was in my tumbling class & so I called him back & he was at the grocery store. So then he called me back & I was at choir practice. So I called him back & he was just about to eat, so he told me to call him back in a few hours. But I didn't I went home & went to sleep. So yeah. I guess I can call him tonite when I get home from work. I wonder wut he's been up to. I wonder if he's comin down here for Thanksgiving or Christmas or sumthing. Maybe Winter Break. I guess I can ask him that later if I talk to him.

I guess that's all for now. Next week is Thanksgiving Break. Woo hoo!!!"

"event","So Chris didn't go to skool today b\c he is sick. So he took his mommy to work & then went to the doctor & then brought me food & was just gonna come to skool for 5 & 6 hour b\c he has physics 5th hour. But when he left the house, he forgot his backpack. So he was just gonna bring me food & eat w\ me, then go home & go back to sleep. So when he called his mom to tell her, she FREAKED out & got mad b\c that wasn't their agreement. I mean, I can understand her being a little annoyed, but come on!! The poor boy is never sick, so when he is, it's really sad, & he doesn't really need to be at skool anyways. But she apparently started yelling at people at her work & so she wanted him to come get her so she could go home. So he did & then when they got home, she was being a ""biosch"" to him <his word> & was yellin at him & he ""popped off"" <also his word> one too many times & she grounded him. She took his liscence, keys to his truck, t.v., phone, & I'm gonna assume his computer. So yeah. It's not good. he's not very happy. He still doesn't know if he's gonna go to skool tomorrow or not. I feel bad. His mom is trying her hardest to show  him that she still has control over him his last year at home. She's freakin out about weird stuff. I admit that I didn't really know her b4 all this stuff, but she didn't start acting like weird until the year started. So, yeah. I really don't know. It's sad. I just hope that it all turns out okay. I'm sure that it will. I don't see why it wouldn't. I guess that's all I have to say. For now..."

"event","Today, my youth group started up again b\c we didn't have enuff people to come b4 b\c we were all busy. So we started again. Chris came & it was a lotta fun. But one our old youth group members left the church about a year ago b\c his mom had sum drama w\ the church. He was\is one of my fav people ever b\c he's sooooo much fun. But me & my friend Sarah decided we would call him & get him to come tonite b\c we haven't seen him in forever. So we did & he came <an hour late, but better than nuthin> & it was a lotta fun. But he was leavin' & Chris & I were standin out by our cars talkin' & while Andrew was driving off I said, ""I love Andrew."" & Chris goes, ""Oohhhh,"" just messin around like he was hurt like I didn't love him anymore. So I said, ""Awwwww...It's okay. I just love Andrew. I'm in love w\ you."" He looked at me then looked away then looked at me again & said ""Wut?"" <this all happened in like 2 seconds. Double take, that's the word.> & so I said it again & he just goes, ""Awwwwww...."" & gives me a kiss. Then he looks at me again & then gives me a really big kiss. So, if he hadn't kissed me & I just had his face reaction to go on, I would be freaking out. But since he kissed me, I think that it's okay.

     About 2 months into our relationship, we had sum serious talks about a lot of stuff. I asked him if he liked skirts or shorts better <skirts> & stuff like that. Just little stuff about him & wut he thinks about stuff. So when I asked if he thinks there is a difference between loving sumone & being in love, we got into a pretty decent discussion. He said, ""I do think there is a difference between them. Loving sumone is that deep care for them, but they can still annoy you & you just want to kill them. But I think that being in love means that you just can't be w\o that person. You want to spend forever w\ them. They can still annoy you, but it's different. You would rather be w\ them & be annoyed than be w\o them."" So I was like, wow. So after a while, he said, ""So, since we've talked about it, do you love me, or are you in love w\ me?"" See, now another thing must be known about me. I freak out soooo easily w\ relationships & being too close & commitment & stuff like that. So normally if anyone else had asked me that, I would have gone running & found a reason to break up w\ him. But it just so happens that I had watched one of those celebrity wedding shows & while I was watching it I started thinking about my wedding, which is weird in itself b\c I am NOT one of those girls who knows exactly how their wedding is gonna be when they're 2 years old. The whole idea of marriage scares the crap out of me. Spending the rest of your life w\ sumone is a looooooong time & requires sooooooo much trust & for a long time, I was not willing to give that trust. But anyways. The fact that I was thinking about my wedding is weird. But while I was thinking about it, the only thing that I could see was Chris as the groom. And it didn't scare me. I was really okay w\ it. So when he asked me if I loved him or was in love w\ him, that's wut I told him. He just sat there on the other end of the phone & said, ""Wow. That's kinda weird."" Then we started on sumthing else & after a while I said,""Did wut I said freak you out?"" He said no & I said, ""Then wut did it do?"" He said, ""I really don't kno. But I do kno that it didn't freak me out."" And that was that. 

     But I'm thinking that's why he did the double take & said, ""Wut?"" B\c he knos how I am about serious stuff like that. I mean, about a month into our relationship, he said that he wanted to tell me that he loved me, but b4 we had even started dating, I told him about how I was w\ stuff like that. So instead of telling me that he loved me, he pointed to his eye, then to his heart, & then at me, except all in one motion. So when he did that, I started to freak, but I made myself not think about it like that. I just said, Wut? So he did it in slow motion & just pointed one at a time. He pointed to his eye & I said, ""I."" Then he pointed to his chest\heart & I said, ""Sternum?"" And so that became our ""I love you."" But almost 2 months into our relationship, he told me that he loved me & it was okay. So yeah. The other day, I told him why I did the Sternum thing & he said that he did the motion thing to not freak me out. 

     But yeah. I'm just curious as to wut he's thinking about it. I don't think that I've ever been in love w\ anyone. I kno that I ""loved"" Caleb, but I think that was a completely different thing. He was my first serious b\f & my first kiss & all that jazz. He was a lot of firsts for me & I guess I just latched onto him. We were so much alike. We both freak out easily & I think that's wut happened w\ us. But it's all okay. I haven't talked to him in a long time. I miss him. But oh well. If he wanted to talk to me, he would call me. Christopher is sick & he's gonna try not to go to skool tomorrow & he's gonna try to talk his parents into it. So he said that he's gonna call me tonite to let me kno if he's goin or not, so I guess I can ask him about it later if he's not to sick. 

    All in all, I'd say that this was a pretty good weekend. I'm very happy about it. Hopefully everybody else's was a s good as mine."

"event","Okay. So here's wut happened. Friday was the homecoming picnic at skool & we basically had 2 & a half hours of lunch & games. So I was walking w\ Rai & Chris & our friend Brandon <from Chris's church> & I was trying to find sumthing to eat. So thru out the whole picnic, he kept running into his ex-girlfriends\friends & he would just leave me to go talk to them & I'd turn around & be like, Where did he go? & I'd see him over there talkin to sum other girl that I don't kno. So I got annoyed during the whole picnic & bitched about it to Rai & Brandon, I'm sure, could hear. So then on the way home, he asked me if it upset me when he talked to Ashely & Amanda & all his ex-girlfriends. I said that it didn't really upset me, it just annoyed me that he would just ditch me to go talk to them & not say anything to me about it. So then Saturday. Oh gosh Saturday. Okay, let me tell you this now: I'm one of the biggest drama queens in the entire world & I am just starting to realize this. Buy anyways. I was supposed to go to my friend Hunter's film festival thingy at 10:30 in the morning, but when I went out to start my car, the battery was dead. So I had to call my parents b\c they were at Walmart to come home & jump start my car. So about an hour later, I left for Centenary <where the thing was> & got there at about 11:45. They had already shown Hunter's film & I was mad that I missed it. So Chris & Rai & Brendon <Rai's boyfriend> & I all left & were gonna go see The Incredibles, but the next one was at 1:25 or sumthing like that, but I had to go to the Christmas Play practice at my church on the other side of town at 2:00. So we just went to Albertson's & got sum food & rented sum movies & went back to Chris's house b\c his parents & little sis are in New Orleans for her soccer tournament. But I was not a happy camper & hadn't been all day b\c off the loser chick that I am. Chris hadn't hugged me all day. We had spent about an hour & a half together & he had barely touched me. He hugged me at Albertson's, but only b\c he saw that I was upset & I was standing away from everybody else by myself & asked me wut was wrong. So I just pretty much ignored him the whole time & didn't talk to anybody. But on the way to Albertson's from Tinsel Town, everybody had to stop & get gas, so while we did that, I told Rai wut was going on in my head & she said that it was kinda weird but I was just probly over reacting. I agreed, but I still couldn't help but be upset. So I knew that Brendon would ask Rai wut was wrong w\ me, so I told her she could tell him if she wanted to & it didn't really matter to me. So when we got to Chris's house, he was in the kitchen gettin food & Brendon was sitting in the bean bag chair next to me & said, ""Lisa, just tackle him & give him a big hug. That's all you have to do."" So I said, ""I don't want him to hug me."" Brendon said, ""Then you don't really have that much to complain about then do you? But wait, didn't he hug you at the store?"" I said, ""I should have to say sumthing to him about hugging me. He only hugged me b\c he saw that I was upset."" At this point my eyes started to tear up & I went to the bathroom & stopped it b4 my face got too red & it was obvious to everyone around me that I was trying not to cry. So then I went in Chris's room & laid on his bed & about 5 minutes later, Chris came in & asked if I was okay & if I was gonna go to sleep. I said that I was fine & I was gonna go to sleep & he said that he was gonna go back in the living room & watch the movie. So he did & I stayed there, & cried a little bit b\c I'm a loser. About 10 or 15 minutes later, he came back in & laid down beside me & gave me a hug & turned me around face him & asked if I was tired. I said yeah & the he leaned back so the light was shining on my face & he said, ""Have you been crying?"" I said no & then laughed b\c it was REALLY obvious that I had. So he sat up & looked at me & asked wut was wrong & I just sat there for like, 2 or 3 minutes w\o saying a word. He looked at me & had this face that he gets when he's concerned & doesn't know wut's going on. So I put my head on his knees & wrapped my arms around his legs &, I don't wanna say I cried sum more, but a few more tears found their way down my face. So after a while I just said, ""I'm such a drama queen."" He said, ""Wut is there to drama about?"" I said, ""You didn't hug me."" He said, ""When?!"" I said, ""Today. You didn't hug me for like an hour."" He said, ""I'm sorry, baby."" Then I just sat there w\ my head on his knees & waited for him say sumthing else & he said, ""You are a drama queen."" I just nodded. Then he picked me up & gave me a really big, long hug. So then we went back into the living room & by that time it was about 1:20, so I had to leave in about 10 or 15 minutes. So I watched a little bit of the movie & then I told them I was leaving & I gave Rai a hug & Brendon was sitting on the couch & so I leaned over the back & hugged his neck & he said, ""I hope you feel better."" So then Chris walked me outside & when we got to the car, he gave a kiss & a hug & says, ""I'm sorry."" I said ""Don't be."" And then I left. So I went to play practice, but nobody showed up, so I get to leave at about 2:45. So I called Chris to see wut he wanted to do & we decided to go see The Incredibles at 4 sumthin & I just went to his house. I love his bed. So much. It's soooo comfortable & warm & I just love it. So everytime I go to his house & his parents aren't home, I just lay in his bed under the covers & wait for him to come lay w\ me & wrap his arms around me b\c I love that. He makes me feel super safe. So when I got to his house, i went straight to his bed & went to sleep. It was nice. Then we left & were gonna go to the movie, but it was sold out & so we went to Chili's & then were gonna go to the Tech game at Independence Stadium, but we didn't kno that they were gonna be charging for parking & neither one of us had money, so we went beck to his house & tried to find money & we did, so we went all the way back across town & by the time we got over there it was like 7: 35 & the movie was at 7:55, so we just went to the movie. It was great. It was one of the funniest movies ever made. But anyways. On the way home, <actually, his house> we were talkin about sumthing & I said sumthing about me being the best girlfriend in the world. So then I said, ""I'm sorry for being a bitch to you the past few weeks."" He said, ""Yeah, I noticed that you had been really upset w\ me, just recently. Is there a reason for it?"" I said yeah & he asked wut it was & I said, ""I've just been really insecure lately. That's wut the whole deal w\ the ex-girlfriend thing is."" He said, ""You have no reason to feel insecure about anything. Especially about them. I don't consider them ex-g\f's, I just consider them friends. But you can be damn sure that I want to be w\ you more than I want to be w\ anyone else. If I didn't, I wouldn't have put 6 months into this relationship."" So yeah, then it was all okay. But I still feel really stupid. B\c I kno that I HAVE been really stupid. 

    But the thing is, I don't think that I've ever been just friends w\ my ex-people. I've never had a friendship turn into sumthing more. It's always been us liking each other & flirtation & then finally dating& then us breaking up. Then not talking for a long time & then talking & us still liking each other & wondering why we broke up & then getting back together & the whole thing starts over. But I don't really have to worry about ex-people b\c all of my serious ex-b\f's live in different states. Caleb lives in Colorado, Marshall lives in Utah, & Dustin lives in Arkansas. So I don't have to deal w\ those feelings except when they come into town which isn't very often. So I kno how I deal w\ ex-people which I think is wut screws me up when Chris talks to all his ex-people. I thought that he still liked them & so I was freakin out b\c I thought that he was gonna like break up w\ me or sumthing. But I think that it's okay now. But I'm still used to getting bitchy when he talks to them & about them, so it's gonna take me a little while to get out of that mind set. It's sad that I'm like that. But oh well. 

     Is it sad that I don't really have any guy friends? I have guy friends that like me & guy friends that I'm sum wut attracted to for various reasons, but no mutual friendship thing going on. Well, no. That's not true. Rai's b\f, Brendon & I are just friends. When I first saw him sophomore year, I thought that he was really cute & funny, but had never talked to him b4, so the next year when Rai had 1st hour w\ him & they started ""talking,"" I kinda backed off. Then I didn't really talk to him over the summer b\c he was busy movin to Tech & doin college stuff. So now, it's just friendship. It's nice, I like it. I like having guy friends, b\c they're the ones that you can cuddle\spoon w\ & not have to worry about them getting the wrong idea & them trying for sumthing more than just cuddling. That another reason why I LOVE gay guys. They're awesome to me & it upsets me that people are pains in the ass about it. So they have a different sexual preference. It's not like they're trying to make you gay or come after you & rape you. I hate it when people are closed-minded. 

Anyways....

    I still have to ask Chris sum more about the Ashley thing b\c even tho he made me feel better w\ our convo, I still have it in my head, ""Wut if Ashley decides that she wants to be w\ him?"" And I actually feel so much better & I just wanna keep that feeling going. So I'll just ask him about it. He's so easy to talk to & I don't kno why I freak out about this stuff. But anyways. I think that's all I have to say for now."

"event","So about a week after I found out he was moving, he calls me & tells me. So I cry & it's sad & he asks me wut he's supposed to do up there w\o me. So I tell him to do exactly wut he's been doing down here. So that was that. So he moved & only comes back down for breaks, i.e. Thanksgiving, Spring Break, etc. So everytime that he came down, I had a b\f but, like, a day or so b4 he came down, I would break up w\ them, just in case there was sum chance that we would get together or sumthing. So I did that about 3 or 4 times until i met Chris. Then after that, I was just like no more Caleb. I want Chris. 

     But all of that just to say that I really do understand wut Chris means about him & Ashley. It's the same except she lives here & he has to deal w\ it everyday. I don't really think that I ever have. But I still can't help feeling the way that I do. I feel SO much better than I did b4 I asked him about it, but still I don't really kno wut's going on. I don't kno how he feels about everything. Like, wut if she does show interest? I kno that I already said\wrote that, but I'm so scared about it. And I kno that I REALLY need to talk to him about it, but I'm scared to. He's always said that I can ask him anything & shouldn't be scared to, but I am. I feel bad that he doesn't kno wut's going on in my head. B\c it's kind of gotten me really pissy towards him & VERY defensive so I get frustrated & annoyed w\ him easily & it's really sad. So, yeah. I dunno. It's weird. Usually I don't let a b\f annoy me. I'll break up w\ him b4 that happens. But even tho he does stuff that I really understand, I still want to be w\ him b\c I honestly believe that I love him. Even tho I'm only 17 & I don't really think that I kno the definition of ""love,"" I kno wut I feel & it makes me happy, so I'm gonna go w\ love. He makes me so happy & I hate to be w\o him. I'm just now realizing that I don't have to talk to him on the phone every single night. But yeah. It's kool tho. 

    And I swear if another guy hits on me that isn't my b\f, I'm gonna have to hurt them. It's really getting old. I guess that I should be used to it tho. I'm soo clueless it's sad. I just found out that one of my friends likes me & has for about a year & a half. It's kinda weird, but I'll deal w\ it. I feel kinda bad b\c I don't like him like that, but oh well. 
    
    I got mad at Chris for no good reason the other day. He said sumthing abuot my driving & if I got into a wreck he would be mad & cry & I got really mad. Like, super mad. I didn't talk to him all the way to skool or even at skool. So skipped like, all of 1st hour & vented to my friend Rai & tried not to cry & then got better, so it was all okay. I feel so bad for Chris tho b\c he doesn't understand at all wut is going on w\ me & I'm scared to tell him b\c...I don't know why.

"event","So I sat there like, okay, wut does that mean? So I told him why I asked that & he said, ""You don't have anything to worry about. I know that we're never gonna be together, but it's still there in the back of my mind. It's just always there."" So I was like, okay then. He asked if I understood & I said no & after a few more ""you have nuthing to worry about""'s, I went to bed. So usually when sumthing like that happened, I'll sit there & obsess about it all nite & not sleep. But I didn't this time. I thought about it for like half an hour, then went to sleep. But I do understand now, b\c I realize that I have a same situation thing going on, only I don't have to deal w\ it everyday.
    The begining of my sophmore year, I met a friend, Caleb, of a friend, Sarah, who had just moved here from Denver. He said that he liked me, but I had a boyfriend & that was it. About a week later, my b\f & I had a huge fight & we broke up. So Sarah called Caleb & gave him my number & we talked for about 2 hours.Then about a week later, we started dating. We were each other's first serious relationship & it was one of those, I have to be w\ you 24\7, but it was hard to see each other b\c he had wrestling practice at Evangel & I had cheerleading sumwhere else. So a week b4 our 4 month mark, the day before Valentine's, he called me & said that he thought we should break up. So I was a wreck for a few days & it was bad. We didn't talk for a few months until our trip in March. Then we got back together for a few weeks then broke up again, but it was a little more mutual this time. So then we didn't talk for another couple of months, until July. We still had the definite flirtation thing going on for about a week, but then we got into a fight or sumthing & stopped talking again. Then about a month later, I found out from his grandma that he was moving back to Denver & I was mad that he hadn't told me. 

Ran out of time again."

"event","I've had this boyfriend for a little more than 6 months. The longest relationships either of us have ever had. But recently, I've been freakin out. I have this deal w\ trust. I don't trust people. There are about 2, maybe 3 people that I trust. My best friend, Rachel\Rai, my dad usually, & my boyfriend Chris, which is sumwut unusual. B\c I trust him ALOT. But he has these 2 ""best friends"" that are girls & he dated them both at one point or another. I use """" b\c they haven't been the bestest friends to him for about a year. But that's another story for later. So about a month ago, I asked him wut it was like to date Ashley & Chelsea (the friends) & he doesn't really 'memeber wut it was like w\ Chelsea b\c he was in 7th grade & she was in 6th & they were together like a week or sumthin. But then Ashley. Okay, he says that he didn't have ANY friends in elementary or middle skool, which for sum reason I find hard to believe. If you know him, then you understand wut I mean b\c he's one of those people who just talks to the people around him b\c he's a ""funny guy"" type. So apparently he met Ashley in 8th grade & she was the first person to ""treat him like a real person."" So when he got into 9th grade, he asked her out & they dated for about a month, but didn't really get to see each other b\c she was still in 8th grade. They couldn't drive, went to diff skools, & only really got to see each other at church. So then they broke up. But apparently there's always ""been sumthing there"" between the two of them. And she has this new boy friend & Chris doesn't like him & doesn't really like to be around them when they're together b\c he ""hates to see them all over each other."" So yeah. About a month goes by & this is driving me crazy b\c I don't understand wut's goin on. I don't kno if I should be worried or wut. So I let it get so bad that if any girl comes around Chris, I'm automatically like, ""Grrrrr....."" which is definitely NOT wut I'm like. Jealousy is stupid to me. It's a waste of time. It's just better to be happy for the person or wutever. But when Ashley came & talked to him at skool, I would just walk away w\ my friend Rai & not say a word to her, the whole time feeling horrible. B\c she's not a bad person at all. I just don't kno wut to do with the whole situation. It got even worse to the point that I would get mad at him for stupid little stuff & not let him kno. So there's all this pent up frustration inside me & that's definitely not good. So I finally decided to ask him about it about 2 days ago. I said, ""So you still like Ashley?"" He said, ""No...not really. Not as anything more than a friend."" So yeah. I'm gonna continue later b\c I wanna go to bed."

"event","My boyfriend's roommate has to get rid of her cat in the next couple of days.  The landlord won't let her keep her so she's probably going to have to take kitty to a shelter. So sad :(  

If anyone wants a very sweet white kitty let me know and I'll pass along the word.  :)  She's very friendly and playful and likes to talk to humans.   Hehe.  She's in good health and is already fixed.   I would take her myself, but my a new apartment is too small and my kitty is a little snob and insists on being an only cat. Hehe."

Anyway, life's been good, got into college, PENN STATE BITCHES

&lt;AC Rant&gt;
AND ANTHROCON IS COMING UP.&nbsp;OMG I'M AN AC VIRGIN AND I'M SO GIGLY! I want to see if Kaz wants to sleep over at my place during the con, but she hasn't been on IM for soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooooooooong, so I haven't been able to talk to her. IF YOU READ THIS KAZ I SENT YOU A NOTE ON EITHER FA OR DA (icantrememberwhich) AND YOU'D BETTER REPLY OR I'LL KILL YOU.

ahem

Anyway, There's a bunch of people I hope to meet... like... ALOT. Blitz... Seel... Prast... Strype, Larathen, Lee Lee, AC, and a bunch more that I can't think of right now &lt;___&gt;;;; Hmmm... maybe I'll get a bunch of people together and we can go to Kennywood. However, I MUST get a group together and go to the Cheesecake Factory, as I've recently found out that many of the people going have never been to one D8. WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?!?! The Cheesecake Factory is the greatest restaurant in the world! 8B Even if we don't go, AC'll still be great.
&lt;/AC Rant&gt;

Speaking of the CF, I'll be getting a job there at the beginning of the month. XD No job right now, so plenty of time for procrastination, which is nice, since school's been a pain lately. Essay's tests, ugh. SUMMER. I WANT SUMMER. Well, at least St. Patty's Day is this weekend. O: Plenty of drunk people to photograph!!!"

"event","Well, they were kinda easy i guess, except for the end questions which are always impossible. The essay was retardedly easy as usual, ""is a person's identity made by what they do or it is formed from what people think of them"" or sum dumb shit like that. Well, after me and some friends went bowling and ate Chinese. Then we went to the mall where we ate at the Cheesecake Factory. T.T I spend too much money. Ya, that was about it, it was fun though! :3"

"event","OMG that sounds retarded.
Anyway... Yeah, I've always had a fascination w/ airlines. Pretty colors and whatnot. So I started to make my own. The first I made was called Fresh Air. Corny, no? Well, I then made one for Dragoneer which you can view at FA or DA. Currently I am making a few for some people&nbsp;I know, even if they don't know me... Yeah, well I'm making them for free if you want one. It might take me awhile, but I'll get to you. Just drop me a note or comment or summat at FA or DA and I'll see what I can do. :)"

"event","So bored. Yet so wired. O_o I can't believe that I have nothing to do except write my first journal. Though it is five in the morning. Right now I am watching ""Gandhi"" for the upteenth time. I love Ghandi. What he represented and stood for. Many did. And he was shot for it. *coughs* Anyway, as I lay here on my stomach, getting a sore back, I ponder what new ideas I have for my cemetary project -see my bio in my profile- and wondering the what the fastest way is to the airport tomorrow-no today. O God I need to get to sleep- so I can get my Canadian currency for my trip to Niagara Falls on Friday. Goes Oooooo. Niagara Falls. In a monotone voice -again, see my bio. My eyes are dried out now. Good night...Oooooo... Morning... Never mind. T.T"

http://www.eap-journal.com/archive/v40_i1_04-lind.pdf

Page 71
&#39;If a concept is given a different interpretation by the public than by the economists, there is a large risk that politicians and the general public misunderstand what economists actually talk about and what economists are measuring when they use the concept of excess burden. Some economists have noted that there is such a misunderstanding. This misunderstanding seems to be a world-wide problem.&#39;

&#39;It can therefore be argued that the economists, by their move from the Pigovian to the modern interpretation of excess burden, have exaggerated the negative side effects of taxes and have given the public, and the politicians, a misleading picture of the consequences of major changes in the tax systems in many countries during the recent decades.&#39;"

"event","While I can be persuaded that punitive damages should not in their entirety be awarded to the plaintiff in tort cases, I think that Liebeck vs McDonalds shows why punitive damages, even at times in amounts that are surprising, can be a necessary part of consumer protection.

Without at least the consideration of a considerable punitive damage award, Stella Liebeck would have been just number 701 - still representing just one out of every 24 million cups of coffee sold, and a number that McDonalds considered trivially different from zero.&nbsp; This was the reason that Morgan requested a punitive damage based on coffee sales volume.

I think that punitive awards for willful endangering behavior should continue to be part of the legal recourse for consumers.&nbsp; How much the plaintiff can receive, vs how much is directed to other purposes by the government, may be an interesting discussion. &nbsp;

http://www.social.mtu.edu/faculty/speters/WrightsMcDonaldsfacts.htm

&#39;McDonald&#39;s safety consultant, Robert Knaff, a human-factors engineer, asserted that 700 complaints, which was about one for every 24 million cups of McDonald&#39;s coffee sold, was &quot;basically trivially different from zero.&quot;&#39;

&#39;The jury was further surprised to learn that during the prior ten years McDonald&#39;s had received more than 700 reports of coffee burns ranging from mild to third-degree, and had settled burn claims for amounts up to and exceeding $500,000.&#39;

&#39;Christopher Appleton, the McDonald&#39;s quality-assurance manager who previously had been deposed in the Texas case, testified that despite the complaints and despite knowing that its coffee was causing serious burns when spilled, McDonald&#39;s had not consulted burn experts and had no plans to change any of its coffee policies or procedures. &quot;There are more serious dangers in restaurants,&quot; he said.&#39;

&#39;Adopting [Attorney for the Plaintiff] Morgan&#39;s suggestion that punitive damages be assessed equal to one or two days&#39; worth of McDonald&#39;s coffee sales, which Morgan estimated to be $1.35 million per day, the jury awarded Stella $2.7 million in punitive damages. &quot;It was our way of saying, &#39;Hey, open your eyes. People are getting burned&#39;,&quot; juror Bell said later.&#39;"

"event","I am in favor of recall elections during contentious times as a means to establish the continued &quot;consent of the governed&quot; as discussed and detailed by the Wisconsin Constitution. A competing view has been very popular among Wisconsin conservatives this year: the official won the election, in the absence of malfeasance in office a change should only take place at the next election in the regular cycle.

Since the story of alleged physical aggression by one Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice against another, I&#39;ve been quite surprised by reactions calling for resignation or removal of Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson.

I fail to see how removal or resignation of a Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice with a history of election by wide margin of Wisconsin voters, and that has not been implicated with wrongdoing in any recent matter, would restore public confidence in Wisconsin.

Looking for a titanium spine? I think Shirley Abrahamson just might have one.

In 1999, 3 then-current Supreme Court Justices appeared in campaign advertisements for Sharren Rose, Chief Justice Abrahamson&#39;s opponent in that race.

These three Justices, together with a fourth Justice, had previously attempted to limit the powers of the Chief Justice by introducing a rule allowing committee to take on various duties and responsibilities.

In the face of this opposition in 1999, and having already won election to 2 ten-year terms on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson won election to another 10 year term by over 200,000 votes for a nearly 2-to-1 victory.

Consider that the two Justices not on record as opposing her power as Chief Justice or her re-election in 1999 were Justice David T. Prosser, Jr and Justice Ann Walsh Bradley!

Consider also the 2009 election for the current Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice. She garnered nearly 60% of the vote, winning a whopping 80% of the reporting units/voting wards and 94% of the counties of Wisconsin!

As far as I know, in the 2009 election neither Koschnick nor any then-current or former Supreme Court Justices brought up the ten-year old opposition to the Chief Justice or its causes. I think they may all have learned a lesson - Wisconsin wants this judge on the Supreme Court.

Calls for the Chief Justice to resign or be removed, accompanied by an assertion that &quot;unrest in the Supreme Court is the fault of the Chief Justice!&quot; puzzle me. My response is to ask... uhhh... how much more unrest at the Capitol before the same voices call for the Governor to step down? Or the leader of either of the legislative bodies?

Regarding the 1999 Supreme Court Justice Election

The February 4, 1999 Wisconsin State Journal contains an article by Cary Segall, titled: &quot;Bablitch Leading Trio Working to Oust Abrahamson&quot;.
This article reports the support efforts of Justices Bill Bablitch, Pat Crooks and Jon Wilcox for Sharon Rose, the challenger in the Supreme Court Justice election that was upcoming at the time.

The Saturday February 13, 1999 Wisconsin State Journal contains an article by Cary Segall, titled: &quot;Four Tried to Reduce Powers of the Chief Justice&quot;.

According to this article, drafts of a rule proposed by Justices Bill Bablitch, Pat Crooks, Don Steinmetz and Jon Wilcox were made public Friday, February 12, 1999 after an open records request by the Wisconsin State Journal and other newspapers.

A six page statement signed by Justices Bill Bablitch, Pat Crooks, Don Steinmetz and Jon Wilcox was released Saturday February 13, 1999.
The Chippewa Herald on Sunday February 14, 1999 included an AP story titled &quot;Supreme Court judges file grievance over Chief Justice&quot; referring to this statement.

According to June 1, 2008 Wisconsin State Journal article &quot;Unseating Abrahamson from State Supreme Court a Daunting Challenge&quot;, the 1999 race saw a combined total of nearly $1.4 million raised. This article states that Abrahamson raised $745,996 - leaving approximately $650,000 raised by the challenger Rose.

The Marquette Law Review, Volume 85 Spring 2002 Number 3 contained the Kearney and Eisenberg article &quot;The Print Media and Judicial Elections: Some Case Studies from Wisconsin&quot;. On page 607, the passage below refers to the 1999 Supreme Court race, which was decided with results of 481,281 (63.5%) for Abrahamson to 276,584 (36.5%) for Rose.

&quot;The 1999 Wisconsin Supreme Court race proved memorable. This is not because the vote was close. Shirley S. Abrahamson, the incumbent chief justice of the state&#39;s highest court, defeated Green Bay lawyer Sharren B. Rose by a nearly two-to-one margin. The vote was sufficiently lopsided that Rose garnered a majority of the vote in only one of the seventy-two counties in the state.&quot;

I would really like to see a copy of that 1999 six page statement signed by Justices Bill Bablitch, Pat Crooks, Don Steinmetz and Jon Wilcox.

Six pages, signed by four Supreme Court Justices, three of whom supported her challenger - yet a nearly 2 to 1 victory statewide for Chief Justice Abrahamson? A victory that was consistent across every Wisconsin county save one?!?

I&#39;d also really like to see the draft of the rule with which they tried to reduce the powers of the Chief Justice. I&#39;d probably have to search through microfiche to get those documents... so I might have to survive without them.

Was there a reason that she was opposed in  her last election by the sitting Chief Justice and several other members  of the Court including Dem justices?&quot;<br /><br /> Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson WAS the sitting Chief justice in 2009,  the last election she won to a 10 year term.  She was appointed to the  Supreme Court in 1976, and has won elections to 10 year terms in 1979,  1989, 1999, and 2009.  She has served as Chief Justice since 1996.

On page 607, the passage below refers  to the 1999 Supreme Court race, which was decided with results of  481,281 (63.5%) for Abrahamson to 276,584 (36.5%) for Rose. <br /> <br /> &quot;The 1999 Wisconsin Supreme Court race proved memorable.

Calls  for the Chief Justice to resign, when they come from supporters of an  embattled governor that won his election with 52% of the vote, puzzle  me.  Even more so when these calls include the argument that &quot;unrest in  the Supreme Court is the responsibility of the Chief Justice!&quot;  Because  then I've just got to ask... uhhh... how much more unrest at the  Wisconsin Capitol must there be before the same voices call for the  Governor of Wisconsin to step down?  If Chief Justice Abrahamson is  somehow solely responsible for unrest on the court... I would be greatly  interested in the well-reasoned argument that absolves the Governor  from responsibility for the protests and the historic recall activity  which continues to unfold.</dd><div style=""overflow: hidden; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;"">&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>"

"event","Even before delving into cosmology, with only a knowledge of classical physics, the correlation of wavelength shift and time dilation for the observer when the emitter is accelerating away is intuitive.&nbsp; It's preliminary validation is in the shifting sound waves of a car accelerating away from a stationary&nbsp; observer.&nbsp; On realizing that the beginning of the song would be synchronized for the emitter and the observer if they are next to each other, but the observed elapsed time of the song to the observer is dilated in comparison to the elapsed time for the emitter*, even without General Relativity the concept of stretched elapsed time for observed events is introduced.&nbsp; The theory of General Relativity enhances and corrects the fundamental understanding when redshift implies accelerating increases in distance due to velocity approaching or exceeding the speed of light.&nbsp; Observational support for redshift and time dilation has been provided by the study of type Ia supernovae light curves.&nbsp; Quasars have to this point been an interesting problem for the model as both redshift and time dilation is less than expected.&nbsp; Possible explanations have included a much more local location for quasars than previously believed, or a gravitational lensing effect that partially reverse redshift and time dilation for Earth observation of Quasars.

For full references, see my livejournal entry on time dilation below.&nbsp; Although neither my post nor my references address the problems posed by quasars or proposed solutions to these problems.
http://lnieders.livejournal.com/56540.html

*In my classical physics example, the relative velocity and acceleration of the emitter to the observer is too small, as is the duration, to introduce any skew in ticking clocks held by observer and emitter.&nbsp; The time dilation or increased elapsed time for the song for observer vs emitter is due only to the increasing distance for the sound waves to travel, and the accompanying travel time for the sound waves.&nbsp; So the total elapsed time for the observer would be the elapsed time for the emitter plus the travel time for the sound waves at the final distance between emitter and observer."

"event","Mathematics was one of my first loves, one of the first things that I  felt I actually did well. Mathematics can describe the world as  accurately as an artistic photograph or a realist artist, or as  abstractly as an impressionist. There is a sublime beauty in sound  mathematics - whether that mathematics is certain geometry, or the  uncertain world of complex system analysis.<br /><br />After developing a  passion for mathematics, I also became an enthusiast of science. I was  especially drawn to particle physics. Murray Gell-Mann was an early hero  of mine. He is one of the pillars of modern subatomic particle models.  Read up on quarks and you'll not be able to escape his name. For  something so elusive, fundamental, and diminishingly small to be  described in terms of colors and flavors - wonderful! And those oddball  leptons!<br /><br />Mathematical models progress from a set of axioms, which  may be only a single axiom depending on the model type. These statements are necessary to  continue building the model, and cannot be proved from within the model.  For those studying and using a given mathematical model, the axiom is  not subject to requests for proof. (Although it may be subject to  requests for proof from other math disciplines in their models)<br /><br />Scientific  models progress from first principles - again it may be possible to build a scientific model from a single first principle. In describing reality, a scientific model can be  only as sound as its first principle(s).&nbsp; At the same time, attempts to portray science as without any need for assumption or faith are misguided in that they neglect the role of first principle components in defining the context of the observation and the context of the prediction or explanation that will be sought.&nbsp; (My definition of science is the use of observation to explain or predict outcomes in a manner which can be validated when the subject and timeframes are accessible.)<br /><br />Religious and spiritual  belief systems are also built on a foundation.&nbsp; Is it valid for mathematics and science to make use of axioms and first principles, and yet somehow unreasonable for religious thought and belief to also make use of a similar type of foundation?&nbsp; I believe it is only appropriate that religious thought proceed in a similar manner.&nbsp; Sometimes &quot;dogma&quot; is  considered to be this foundation for religious thought and belief systems. I think that, however, dogma sometimes  includes items beyond an axiom or first principle - it might contain  items that are meant to separate &quot;true practitioners&quot; from other  adherents in the eyes of some. That's too bad. For my own faith, I  prefer for the foundation to clearly belong to the a family that can be  describe as axioms or first principles. I believe that the statements of  John 1:1-2 fall into this category of axioms or first principles for  Christians.<br /><br />John 1:1-2 NKJV<br /><span style="""" class=""verse John_1_1"">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. </span><span style="""" class=""verse John_1_2"">He was in the beginning with God.</span>"

"event","Because today is the 189th birthday of Gregor Mendel - so told me Google :)&nbsp; - I wanted to call out at least a short list of additional men who were keen in their scientific observations of the world(s) around us, while still holding to a belief in truth that was beyond nature, beyond the bounds that are considered to govern the normal behavior of our universe.&nbsp; While there are many giants in scientific thought whose religious beliefs are matters of controversy, the following scientists have a faith in God that is a matter of record.&nbsp; For some of these men this is because they held an official position within a Christian church or religious order.&nbsp; For others in this list, it is because we have their writings, espousing and defending their faith.&nbsp; Each of these men also had a foundational role in the area of science I note below.<br /><br />Nicolaus Copernicus - Astronomy<br />  Marin Mersenne - Acoustics<br />  Blaise Pascal - Calculating Machines<br /> Robert Boyle - Chemistry<br />  Michael Faraday - Electromagnetism<br />  Gregor Mendel - Genetics<br />  Georges Lema&icirc;tre - Cosmology<br />Basile Luyet - Cryobiology<br /><div><br />Basile Luyet was a longtime resident of Madison, Wisconsin.&nbsp; The  following passage from an article composed near the time of his death  (http://www.planetesacha.com/Cryobiology.html) may capture a position  held by others in the list above, as well as other men and women whose  lives are filled with both the Word of God and books of science.<br /><br />'Born  in Savi&egrave;se (Valais), Switerzland, in 1897, Basile Luyet entered the  congregation of the Missionaries of St. Francis de Sales. His interest  in science dated back to his school days and his entrance into religious  life was made only after he ascertained that he would be able to  continue his study of science.<br /> &quot;I wouldn&rsquo;t enter if they had said no,&rdquo; he adds, explaining that St.  Francis&rsquo; statement &quot;science is the eighth sacrament of the priest&quot; was  his guiding force. He felt strongly that he must learn as much as he  could for true knowledge was most desirable in the Church, &quot;knowledge  that&rsquo;s established with a certainty.&quot;'</div>"

"event","We've been hearing about air traffic controllers and safety lately, after some high profile events where controllers were asleep or otherwise inaccessible.

There has been a little discussion about the reasonableness of their schedule and whether changes should be made.&nbsp; But the tenor of much of the discussion directs responsibility largely to the controller(s) and away from the scheduling and management of this vital service.&nbsp; Consider these NTSB&nbsp;reports, all the way back to a few months after the strike... and decide if the FAA&nbsp;did or did not need some additional motivation to address issues which compromised public safety...

"event","<p>I came across this 1982 document from the Harvard Business School about the Air Traffic Controller strike of 1981.  A very interesting event, as I'm certain many people have opinions today about public sector unions that were formed at least in part as a response to this event.</p><p>http://www.cob.sjsu.edu/long_n/Spring09/bus151_slides/AirTraffic%20Controller%20Case.pdf</p><p>The letter from Reagan to Poli before the presidential election may explain some of the underlying perspectives of the controllers in this episode.</p><p>The letter is, I believe, much more credible in a 1982  document on Harvard Business School letterhead, than from the other  location which seems to be sited everywhere on the internet:<br> http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id296.htm</p><p> page 21<br> Exhibit 5 October 20, 1980 letter from presidential candidate Ronald Reagan to Robert Poli of PATCO</p><p>page 5<br>The FAA itself estimates that 89% of their controllers never qualify for full retirement benefits because medical disabilities force them to quit early (all controllers must pass a rigorous annual physical).</p><p>page 9<br>Observed 26-year old controller Matt Blum, whose base salary was $27,000:<br>     You know how much pilots make [up to $115,000].  They're flying an airplane with 150 people on board and they're using automatic pilot.  We're sitting at a scope working 10 airplanes at once with 150 on each plane.  We have more responsibility and spend more time working.</p><p>Drew Lewis was United States Secretary of Transportation under President Ronald Reagan.  Lewis was the lead negotiator for the government, offering a contract proposal that eventually resulted in a 95% strike vote from union members.</p><p>page 12<br>The Sunday after the strike, Drew Lewis appeared on CBS-TV's ""Face the Nation.""  He conceded that the strikers probably had some legitimate grievances and that there was a need in the FAA for better communication with employees, improved equipment, and changes in work rules.  When asked about the common charge that the FAA is a bad employer, he responded, ""I think it's probably a legitimate charge.""</p><p>page 14<br>At the end of November, the FAA announced that 44 students in the first class (*after the strike -- Lonny) of 145 had failed.  The failure rate in the second class was 31 out of 145, with an additional 17 dropping out before completion.</p><p>page 15<br>In December 1981 a U.S. District Court in Denver dismissed criminal indictments against local PATCO leaders.  The court found evidence that long before the strike, in February 1981 in fact, the FAA had aided the Justice Department in compiling a list of controllers to be singled out for prosecution should a walk-out occur. </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","If the only ommission were to the press, perhaps there would not be as strong of a motivation to investigate further.
However, according the city of Brookfield, the report to the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board was also incorrect.
&quot;Due to an error at Waukesha County, the votes reported by the City of Brookfield were not included in the totals sent by the County to the Government Accountability Board on April 5.&quot;
http://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/DocumentView.aspx?DID=1560

So many references to Supreme-Court-only ballots here, SC-only votes  there, etc, etc. 10000 in Dane County! 18000 in Waukesha County!   Unprecedented!  Outrageous!  Apocalyptic!   
 
 Except I haven't yet seen sources that can support such assertions, much  less that any SC-only ballots (however many actually do exist) in a  given county would yield a given number of votes for either Prosser or  Kloppenburg.  
 
 Are there differences, and even considerable differences, in the total  of votes cast among the different races?  Yep - but that might not  represent a reality as simple as saying that the most-voted on race has  the number of ballots between its vote total and the next most popular  race as ballots with only a single race voted-on.
 
 Working from Waukesha county numbers based on this document:
 http://www.waukeshacounty.gov/uploadedFiles/Media/PDF/Elected_Officials/County_Clerk/Election_Results/20110215_unofficial_results_summary.pdf
 
 Total Votes cast per race
 Supreme Court ~ 125070
 Branch 3      ~  81523
 Branch 4      ~ 106881
 Branch 11     ~  79153
 
 
 The ballots could have broken down something like this, leaving NO ballots with only a supreme court vote.
 Ballots and the Races they contain votes for 
 Supreme Court, Branch 4, Branch 3  ~  34547 ballots
 Supreme Court, Branch 4, Branch 11 ~  72334 ballots
 Supreme Court, Branch 3, Branch 11 ~   6819 ballots
 Supreme Court, Branch 3            ~  11370 ballots
 Total Ballots                      ~ 125070 ballots
 
 My example doesn't take into count that the total ballots cast was  certainly different than the 125070 votes in the Supreme Court race.  (I  just don't know that number, sure it could be retrieved from  somewhere.)  It also doesn't take into account that each race on each  ballot would have one of the candidates specified - I didn't want to  take the time to develop the Venn-diagram-like example to this detail.  
 There are lots of other variations in addition to the example I used  above. Without more information, asserting there is a given number of  ballots with votes only for the supreme court race is shaky. So is  asserting that such ballots with &quot;supreme court votes only&quot; yielded a  given number of votes for a given candidate.
 
 And, are there legit reasons that someone would vote for Supreme Court  and not another race?  You betcha!  Lets use Madison as an example this  time.  Someone on another thread mentioned that in Madison, many  students may have voted for Supreme Court race, and not other races.  I  personally believe that there were a significant number of Republicans  and Conservatives in Madison that may have voted in the Supreme Court  race, and chosen note to vote in the Madison Mayoral race since they  were consigned to pick between Liberal1 and Liberal2 in that race.
 
 All that said - I am firmly in favor of investigation and recount.  But I  do not like a case built for investigation that cannot be supported."

However, according the city of Brookfield, the report to the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board was also incorrect.

Discussion of this letter, and its assumptions (particularly those specified by Ryan's staff):
http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/04/americas_budget

1. Its certainly easier to model government spending in Medicare and Medicaid programs by converting them to fixed contributions toward private plans instead of meeting the costs (whatever they are) of a set list of services and DME. Is ...also far less complex from an administrative standpoint. This is essentially how many employers provide contributions toward health benefits(especially those that offer a choice among multiple health benefit plans).
But is it the right thing to do? I believe that must be decided on more than considerations of expense and risk alone.
2. If this structural change is the right thing to do, should the contribution change over time relative to GDP, US government revenue, US government debt, expected plan costs, or some ratio of these factors? Under the CBO analysis of the current proposal, the contribution is planned to grow at a slower rate than the expected growth for health plan costs, leaving taxpayers utilizing these plans with a growing personal expense over time.

An excerpt from this analysis: 
&quot;After-tax income would rise by 1.5 percent for households in the bottom quintile (the 20 percent with the lowest incomes)... the top quintile would see their after-tax in...come jump 11 percent. Within that group, the top 1 percent would gain an average of 26 percent and the top 0.1 percent a whopping 36 percent. The share of total taxes paid by the bottom 80 percent would rise from 35 percent to 42 percent, while the share paid by the top 1 percent would fall by nearly half from 25 percent to 13.5 percent.&quot;

"event","I've read all the NT scriptures about baptism, most of them many times.  I've done my best to develop a synthesized understanding.  Now its time to document the unresolved questions I have about baptism in the name of Jesus.

Acts 19:1-7 is such an important passage to me.  (The following passage is from the NOV translation, thanks to the YouVersion iPhone app)
While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciple and asked them, ""Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?"" 
They answered, ""No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.""
So Paul asked, ""Then what baptism did you receive?"" 
""John's baptism,"" they replied.
Paul said, ""John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.""
On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.There were about twelve men in all.

Baptism is a simple physical act with a complex underlying spiritual reality.
There is room to grow in understanding one's own baptism through reflection, prayer, and study of the Scriptures for years following the event.
There is also room for coming to a new understanding, and recognizing that a baptism in one's own spiritual timeline may have a significant meaning even if it was not a baptism in the name of Jesus.  This is what these twelve men came to learn in their interchange with Paul.  Accepting that truth, and having recieved the Gospel of Christ, they were baptized in the name of Christ.

I believe this is similar to a progression in my own relationship with God.  I hope that my study of these scriptures and wrestling with the questions they provide will lead others to recognize the value in events in their own spiritual lives, and to pursue baptism in the name of Jesus if this has not already occurred."

Genesis 37:18-20,23-24,28
Genesis 40:19-22
Trials will try to own you.
Life can be a prison if you let it.
Joseph must have had many thoughts such as these:
&quot;God must have abandoned me.&quot;
&quot;I can't make anything good out of my life now...&quot;

Genesis 39:1-5
Joseph makes the best of his circumstances.
Genesis 40:1-7
Joseph did not stop showing&nbsp;care and concern for others because of trying times.
Genesis 45:4-14
When the time came, Joseph transcended the hurt caused by his brothers, and the desire for retribution, with love.
Everything can change in a&nbsp;moment.&nbsp; The concept of self-talk, and how replacing lies wuth truth can be&nbsp;very valuable in trying times.
Your pain is not who you are.

Psalm 18:4-6, 16-19, 32-36

She's been hearing stories about Abram and Sarai during Children's Ministry at Church.&nbsp; I want to reinforce what she's learning there, and also stress quick and polite responses within our home.&nbsp; She may not like doing what I ask her to do... and I don't want to ask her to pretend to be happy.&nbsp; But even when she is doing something she would rather not do (like cleaning her room), she can respond to the request politely.

Lately she has been making her mother wait for quite some time when she is asked to get ready to leave the house, or get dressed in the morning.&nbsp; Her response is often &quot;I didn't understand&quot; or &quot;I don't know how&quot;

Tomorrow we'll look at the miraculous catch of fish in Luke 5:1-11.&nbsp; Peter did not understand how this would help, but he responded quickly and politely.&nbsp; And even though he didn't expect for it to work... by doing what Jesus said, everything turned out ok."

*my cousin's heart is breaking over a boy

* my second cousin died of a heroine overdose

* i got NO work done

* my good friend caroline lost her virginity to a guy who's name she doesn't know, and they didn't have a condom. 

I was really really supportive talking to caroline, i made jokes and asked questions. She's actually seems really fine, which actually scares me more then a complete breakdown would. How can someone go through something so personal in such an impersonal way and not have any feelings about it? She's never even kissed a boy before this year. She did everything else in this one night. So I talked to her and when i was back in my room I started crying. crying!! 

and then lucas told me i was being judgmental and that people had casual hookups all the time. And that got me super super angry. Because just because it happens doesn't mean it's right, and i'd like to believe that there's still something special about sex (because otherwise what are those songs about?) and i want to protect my friends even when they don't need/want protecting. 

so everything sucks, accept that lucas said he was sorry, which is good, because i really don't want to be a"

the other night it sort of hit me that i wasn't going to be going to the same school as lucas anymore, and I started crying, which ended up confusing him as the only thing i could think of to say was ""I'm not stupid you know! I'm not megan!"" 

the point being that as much of a romantic I am, I'm not particularly a fan of super ""romantic"" relationships. Pet names make me queasy, as does the term ""making love"". Holding hands makes me feel awkward (I'm a definite hands shoved in pockets kind of girl) although i wouldn't say anything and hurt his feelings. I know we're not ""together 4FR"", and I don't even know what our chances are post August. I'm a realist, a pragmatist even in the middle of my day dreams. 

but i like him. 

I swear this was had a point. Mostly just that, for a super romantic relationship, a big dramatic ending makes sense. It's a grand conclusion to an epic romance. But for me... for us... it doesn't make sense. I'm not ready yet. I don't want the last time i see him to be anytime soon any more than i want the last time I see clare to be standing on her front steps in the freezing cold. Or anyone else for that matter.

lucas is completely wonderful, and he knows what kind of chocolate I like, and accepts that, even though he refuses to touch it and thinks I'm weird. He's not doing to well though. I'm not going to get into it, but his mom and dad are being really fucked up, and they're hurting him. And I can't do anything. All i can do is tell him he had the right to be angry, and not feel guilty.

this lead to an interesting conversation with my mom about her dealing with her mom's affairs, and her grandpa's affairs, and her uncles affairs. It's funny how these things run in families. My dad's family fights and divorces, my mom's side cheats on each other, and my parents are (so far) the only ones to avoid this. Which makes me kind of proud of them actually, i know it's not easy sometimes.

really talk to you in person or come up with
conversation because we had only become friends
through email and that now this awkwardness had
developed.  Anyway i'm glad thats all over with and
that you seem to like me so much which is soooo
relieving.

well i guess this comes down to that I want you to
know how great you have been and how happy I am and
that your awesome and I love you and that we should
try to see each other more once again.

don't let all my flattery get to your
head

and maybe I was asking too much, but.... they could have said yes
they could have said yes

I went to sleep last night smelling like weed and lucas and honeyed chap-stick, which is just about the most comforting combination ever. And no, I did not partake in the weed smoking, but we watched game shows and shouted out the answers and I kicked their ass so It didn't really matter.
And he saw me in school and said I looked especially amazing, and I said I wished I could say the same but that that was the ugliest shirt I'd ever seen (it had a lion and bob marley on it) and he just laughed and said he knew, but his eurotrash german dad had given it to him. And he's ticklish, which I love. And I told him the story about when he came to chemistry baked, and followed me around for a while fighting with keith and begging me for a suck of the lemon I was eating, he didn't remember it because he was stoned at the time of the stories occurrence, but he did say that he'd hated that year because he'd been miserable about breaking up with olivia and stuff with his parents, so he'd go out and get really high at lunch, but then he'd get to kelly's class and talk to me, and feel guilty, and that just confused him more. And that the sexual tension while we'd watched the Da Vinchi code had been miserable for him (and me as well). And that he hadn't actually planned on asking me out this early in the year, but that I made it to hard not to during opening project because he just wanted to look at me all the time.
And then I had dinner with him and his mom, and one of him mom's friends and then he walked me to the subway.

and then I got to go to sleep smelling like weed and lucas and honeyed chap-stick."

"event","ok details. (extreme detail ahead, be warned)

so after school we walk over to his house, and drop off his bag. Walk from house to subway, and then take the F alllllll the way down to coney island. It's sunny and beautiful and the Cyclone is closed (thank god I hate roller coasters) so we just walked down to the sand and lie down. And we lay down in the sand and watched the clouds for a while. We argued about whether or not one cloud was shaped like a horse (him) or a dog with mouse's head (that one was all me).
And then he said something, I forget what, but he looked at me and all I could think was, ""oh god, he's going to kiss me now. Fuck.""

so of course, I blurt out the first thing that comes to my mind which is.

I AM THE MOST AWKWARD PERSON IN THE UNIVERSE.

i didn't shout it, it just sounded a little panicked.

well he looks confused so I start babbling on, the whole thing was pretty funny, but I start going ""look, I'm sorry, I just need you to know that I'm really awkward, as you can see right now, and I always do the wrong thing, and you need to know this.""
and then I say, ""and I also can never keep my mouth shut"" but then he kissed me so I guess I did.

so then I hid my face in his shirt kinda, and he starts laughing, and I ask why and he says, ""your hair's in my mouth""
well I said, you should be glad it's not down to my butt anymore, because it was all over the place when it was, and then he laughed and he said to look at him, and then he said something wonderful about my eyes and did I know I was beautiful? and asked if I wanted to go out with him.

I said no

and then I kissed him

and he said, ""no?""

and then he kissed me

and so on.

And then he started talking about how he'd been scared to do anything because he didn't want to fuck anything up. And I said, ""stupid boy"" and he said, ""stupid boy, no, charming handsome and extremely well raised boy."" which was funny so I just threw that in there.

ummmmm what else. 

and on the subway home he asked what I was thinking about, and I'm pretty sure I was thinking about harry potter so I lied and said I forgot, asked him what he was thinking about, and he said, ""I'm pretty much just thinking about you"". Which is a really good line."

I also talked to keith briefly, who I couldn't really understand much of what he said, but he said I have a ""sexy phone voice"", which apparently he never says to lucas. this led into a conversation about the fact that hillary clinton won't stop leaving messages at my house, and that she sounds exactly like a man on the phone.

I don't know how I feel. Well I do... I almost started crying on the phone because I do... I feel like he cheated on me. Which is so stupid because WE'RE NOT GOING OUT. He had every right to be a slut and sleep with lara because you know... he's a single guy. I however am a single girl, who has insane standards of loyalty <i>must work on getting rid of those</i>

I HATE THIS. I hate that he can go out and have a meaningless fling because a) no one would want to have a fling with me b) I don't like meaningless flings and c) I like him too much. I hate that he doesn't have to feel any kind of urgency as far as I'm concerned because GUESS WHAT? NO ONE ELSE IS INTERESTED IN ME! This is so unfair!

I had a class with him today (we haven't started normal classes yet), he asked me what room I was in next, I said ""clare's room"" and he came to sit next to me even though he was supposed to be in a different workshop.

I'm at school, i go into spanish class and sit down at a table next to Wade Spinner, we're talking about stupid shit, and lucas comes down, sits on the other side of me, and we all talk about stupid shit. Wade gets called up to the board, Lucas drops his pencil. On the way up from picking up the pencil he kisses me, very chastely, on my jaw (i never have very exciting/dirty dreams). So i of course get really happy, except that then he starts talking about how he really likes me, and wants to go out with me, only there's this other girl and he's not sure which one he likes better.

and we're still in the middle of class.

so I'm whispering at him like, ""you fucking asshole, that's the kind of thing you make your mind up about BEFORE you kiss someone. And he's just like ""hey whatever man"". It's all very horrible, and then it gets worse because the spanish teacher calls on me and i DON'T know the answer, so I just start blubbering and crying in the middle of class.

And all i want to do is talk to someone about it and drink hot chocolate, but the chocolate place is closed and I miss my subway stop."

"event","here's what I have of the math project so far.  I
doubt i'll do that much more work on it.  I couldn't
figure out the third section at all.  If you manage to
do it please send it to me.
Overall I have to say I was satisfied with the movie. 
had they tried to fit in all the parts of the book and
the movie would have been much to long.
Thanks for showing me around brooklyn, I feel a little
more safe there now.
 
I had a great time, thanks

"event","horrible dreams. horrible horrible dreams.
each time I would get close to something I wanted, I'd get snubbed, or would find it unattainable. Every single time. It was so vivid, I""m so shaken up.
and it had so much range, from stupid things like the fact that I couldn't find the second half to a murder mystery I was watching online, to being so close to someone, physically and otherwise, and having them, literally, walk away. Everything I tried to do last night in dreamland failed. I tried to make a dinner for my parents and uncle, and everything burned, or wouldn't set, or didn't thicken. I bought by sister book after book and she never read them (this is true actually).
I'm sick of things almost happening, I can't live on expectation any longer.

whah... I need tea."

"event","aaallll I wanted tonight was to sing. Sad songs. Hopeful songs, but sad songs. I, however, have not been able to sing a note properly since the 4th of May. There's no worse feeling than this, I have no release now. I get wound up, maybe about stupid things, but I get wound up. And I can't write, I don't cry, I'm trying not to eat, and there's nothing on TV. So I sing. And I play. But I can't sing, and I'm not good enough at playing to satisfy what I need right now.

It's all very stupid."

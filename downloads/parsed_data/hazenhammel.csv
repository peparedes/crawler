"event","For several months now I've been reviewing the literature of the ""New Atheism"", a literature of scientific triumphalism propelled and elevated to bestseller status by the disaster of 9/11.  Now that Osama bin Laden has been killed, it seems like an appropriate moment to think about whether the New Atheism measures up to the event which created it, or made it ""new"".  Of course there was atheism before 9/11, but in the modern sense of the word, ""atheism"" is barely 200 years old, and arguably less.  Before that, ""atheism"" was an epithet hurled at people who had different religious ideas, not people who rejected religion entirely.  Before revolutionary liberal democracy imposed a firm separation of Church and State, you could not be an ""atheist"" in the modern sense.  It would be treason.  A skeptic could only promote religious change.  

Richard Dawkins sums this up with the quip: ""We are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.""  Is 9/11 an object lesson, and valid reason to go ""one god further""?

<lj-cut text=""Read More..."">

None of what the New Atheists say seems ""new"" to me.  It all seems like somehting I've heard before, from within the Western religious tradition.  Standing outside of religion, or clothing your arguments in the mantle of ""Science"" or ""Reason"" doesn't seem to add anything.

All three of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) were once ""new"" doctrines.  All three have strong elements of what I will call religious ""nihilism"": efforts to devalue and demonize competing religious culture. It is no defense to ""nihilism"" to assert that the world has meaning and value through God.  Monotheism makes that impossible.  The abstract, logically impossible attributes of the Abrahamic God (omniscience, omnipotence) defy all attempts to derive meaning from God's existence, at least in the manner that polytheistic religions worked (by imputing human motivations to the gods).  God's motives were asserted to be inscrutable, imagining the God in ""graven images"" was prohibited, trying to contact the dead and gain the wisdom of the ancestors was demonized as sorcery or necromancy... the list goes on and on.     

What was the impetus for all this hostility to religion, in the guise of religion itself?  Imperialism. The kingdom of Judea was caught in a power vacuum caused by the fall of the Assyrian Empire, the rise of the Babylonians and their rivalry with the empire of Egypt to the south.  Some Jews backed the Egyptians.  This precipitated an invasion by Babylon in which the walls and Temple in Jerusalem were destroyed.  The royal family and many others were taken hostage and transported to Mesopotamia (hence the term ""Babylonian Captivity""). This became part of a wider Jewish diaspora which included Jews relocated to other centers such as Egypt.  It was during this period (600 BC - 500 BC) that scholars believe the Bible took its final written form.  The Temple was eventually rebuilt, but its religious meaning was forever changed.  It was no longer viable to worship the Lord as a tribal god, able (or willing) to promote the political ends of the Jewish kingdom.  The Jewish god was re-valued as Lord (whose name was never spoken) whose primary characteristic was anger at the people for their sins, as a way of explaining their subjugated political status and the many calamities which they suffered as a nation.

These Jews who write the Bible could and did borrow good ideas from the Babylonians: the Ten Commandments and other parts of the Law clearly come form the Code of Hammurabi, and employ the idea of  punishments fixed in advance for particular offenses.   They drew the line at magic, however.  Why?  For a post-Exilic Jew, divination and sorcery were the religion of their oppressors. The Jews were overrun and dispersed by an advanced civilization.  Mesopotamians had been brewing beer for thousands of years.  Archeologists can argue about cause and effect here: was agricultural surplus the impetus for beer, or was a desire to make more beer the driving force behind, but either way, alcohol and civilization go together.  Early Babylonian astronomy is the source of the Zodiac and the rudiments of astrology.  Around the time they conquered Palestine, the Babylonians may have been making batteries: acid-filled jars with copper and iron parts connected with lead-tin solder, possibly for electroplating gold on silver, possibly to create ""special effects"" for religious idols. If we were invaded tomorrow by technologically advanced space aliens, it might not be as shocking to us.

By reading the Bible only, it's difficult to say whether the Jews, by adopting monotheism coupled with a vigorous religious nihilism with respect to all the religious culture around them, were acting as oppressors or the oppressed.  The Jews took pride in their acts of oppression, shameful as it seems to modern sensibilities.  The texts of the Old Testament detail numerous atrocities committed against the native Canaanites for religious reasons.  In light of non-biblical archeological and historic evidence, however, I'm not willing to take any of that at face value.  Adopting a strict new religion is hardly necessary for demonizing your enemies or creating excuses for hegemonic violence.  It may be necessary, on the other hand, to ensure cultural survival for the victims of such violence.  We know that Judea was overrun by one empire after another: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Macedon, Rome.  While I have no doubt that the Hebrew kingdoms committed all the atrocities they boast of (and more) I believe the reconfiguration of God as a monotheistic abstraction is a response to overwhelming cultural, military and economic force from the outside. 

The God of Moses, the power which delivered and ""saved"" the people from bondage in ""Egypt"", is the  God which turned out to have staying power in the imagination of humankind, long after all tribal gods invoked in battle have been forgotten.  We have heard echoes of the Prophetic theme of justice and righteous in my lifetime, as when Martin Luther King, Jr. quoted Amos 5:24 in his ""I Have a Dream Speech"" (""No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream."")  Collective salvation, the liberation of nations and peoples, seems to go hand-in-hand with condemnation of superstition and mindless ritual.  Jews under the Babylonians, Christians under the Romans, Germans burdened with rapacious taxes under the Roman Church during the Reformation: all demanded a simpler form of religion with social justice at the forefront. All lashed out with iconoclasm and nihilism at the complex forms of art and culture and politics which were encrusted upon older, established (and in their view, ""corrupted"") religion.  Tillich calls this nihilism ""the Protestant Principle"" (taking a historical view of repeating cycles of theological movements, of which the Reformation is probably the most dramatic) though one could take a psychological view and call it simply ""humility"" (less annoying to Catholics, that way).  I prefer to call it ""nihilism"" to remind myself that, when it manifests itself in history as a strong political movement, it's often accompanied by wars or pogroms or various other forms of psychotic violence. 

The New Atheists can object that fundamentalists represent ""true"" or ""natural"" religion, and that more sophisticated views which incorporate doubt, skepticism and humility are merely a whitewash promulgated by elite, contemporary intellectuals to defend Religion against the implacable and inevitable March of Science.  This is the position Dan Dennett takes in ""Breaking the Spell"", and it is utter and total hogwash.  Dennett mistakes fundamentalism for religion (by defining religion as belief in a supernatural agent who must be appeased).  This isn't religion, this is legalism or fundamentalism: an extreme form of religious orthodoxy used to mask objections to social change.  With respect to the Abrahamic religious traditions which have religious skepticism built into them, fundamentalism is a perversion, reversal, and repudiation.  Fundamentalists make God their mouthpiece for the preservation of peculiar, obsolete cultural habits, rather than the judge of those habits.  Today's fundamentalists, be they ""Christians"" who shoot abortion doctors, or ""Muslims"" who bomb buildings, all seem pretty damn sure that their obsolete cultural concerns (all somehow related to the subjugation of women) constitute the Law of God.  They lack humility and doubt, which I think disqualifies them as true Christians or true Muslims.  On the other hand, I'm perfectly willing to admit that what I call ""true"" Christianity may be want I want it to be, rather than what it is.  I'm perfectly willing to jettison ""fact"" in favor of an aspirational goal of a better religion.  

You can object that the skepticism or nihilism which is internal to the Abrahamic traditions is not an all-encompassing religious nihilism, just a selected one.  You can say that the various writers of the Bible, and all the theologians since, are all united in condemning the religions of others, but not their own.  You can call that lack of self-reflection ""hypocrisy"" or intellectual dishonesty if you like, or like Dennett, you can construct an elaborate hypothesis that theological doubt is just a self-protection mechanism intended to put religion beyond rational discussion (an ""adaptation"" which insures survival of the viral religious ""meme"" through replication over time).  In context, though, it seems many peoples at many times have used militant monotheism as a sword and shield against the oppression of a dominant culture.  One could say the same about Islamic extremists today.  The history of Islam has included a wide variety of sects, from the skeptical-rational to the mystical-absurd and everything in between.  Rather than embrace this diversity, the Wahabist Muslim extremists seem to take a very selective slice of their culture which emphasizes their differences from global Western society.  The result is fanatic violence, but is this a case of ""too much"" religion, or not enough?

There seems to be a major blind spot in Anglo-American empirical skepticism.  Science did not give us liberal democracy.  Our constitutions and legal institutions were not developed in manner of empirical, natural science: by observation, experimentation and peer review.  ""Experience"" (in the sense of history) may have led to the recognition of these ""rights"", and ""experience"" is our guide in implementing them in a legal tradition.  We lawyers argue from books and precedents, but we do not assert hypotheses and then test them under controlled conditions.  Science has become an independent source of ""evidence"", in fact, the most important and only truly reliable source of evidence in the modern courtroom.   Evidence, however, determines ""facts"" not ""law"": it shapes a case and suggests a decision, but it doesn't establish the rules which will be invoked to justify the decision.  For example, in a murder case, forensic evidence might prove that the accused committed the crime.  But the definition of the crime, what constitutes ""murder"", is decided by law.   Laws change.  Even religious laws: Paul said the letter kills but the spirit gives life, and helped define Christianity by relieving Christians of many of the burdens of Jewish law.  Fundamentalists rationalize these changes away with bizarre and elaborate theories like ""dispensationalism"" and the New Atheists argue as if these changes have never happened.  Ultimately I find this just as tiresome and despicable as fundamentalism.  

Let me take another legal example which troubles me about the New Atheism: their universal revulsion for the religious indoctrination of children.  Just as 9/11 helped make the case that religious extremism is dangerous, the worldwide pedophile priest scandal in the Catholic Church helps support a case that religious indoctrination is abuse.  I can get behind legal action in specific cases of abuse.  If there's some tangible harm, like sexual abuse or withholding medical care, I don't think you'll find a lawyer in any civilized place in the world who would not recognize a ""cause of action"" in theory (though of course we reserve judgment until allegations are proven).  The New Atheists, however, ask more of me.  They want me to consider brain-washing children into superstitious ignorance as a civil rights violation in itself.  Religious indoctrination certainly has its cruel aspects, causes massive suffering and fuels an anger which seems to be taking on the character of a political movement.  Indeed, one might say that the rising tide of resentment is what the New Atheists are surfing on, which sells so many books.  The suggestion that society should intervene and protect children from religious indoctrination, however, runs smack into the ""free exercise"" clause of the First Amendment (or similar statements in international law, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights).  I am completely at a loss when it comes to concrete ways to address this.  Everything I've said above depends not only on adult rationality but a high level of education.  I don't impose my religious views on my kids, I don't even go to church anymore.  We're not talking about me personally, or what I should do, or what you should do.  We're talking about invading other people's privacy and violating their right to religious liberty.  I must admit that when it comes to people who teach their children that dinosaurs walked with Jesus, or that God hates fags, the idea of intervention sounds attractive."

"event","When Facebook changed the ""status"" interface, I used that opportunity to do a couple of things.  First I confirmed my marriage, something Katy found delightful.  She thought it was like having one of those ceremonies where you re-affirm your vows, only in cyberspace.  

Then I changed my ""Religion"" from ""Progressive Christian"" to ""Christian Atheist"".  I did this primarily to scare off so-called ""Christians"", i.e. Christofascists.  Much to my surprise this triggered a phone call from Mom (a retired Lutheran pastor) wondering if this was desperate cry for help in the midst of some personal crisis.  I had to reassure her there was no personal crisis, that the timing of the thing had to do with a software update and not anything going on with me, though there is a greater political crisis going on.  

<lj-cut text=""Read More..."">

Talking with my mom, I may have mentioned the 2009 Churchwide Assembly in our denomination, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, wherein a surprisingly large number of representatives objected to ordaining homosexuals in committed relationships, and now are dragging their members out to yet another break-away Lutheran synod, the North American Lutheran Church.  

I did not mention that I prefer to call the NALC the ""Nazi American Lutheran Church"", in remembrance of all the Lutherans who called themselves ""German Christians"" and supported the Nazis with rabid anti-semitism.   I know my mother stands among the majority of Lutherans who take seriously Jesus' suggestion that we remove the plank from our own eyes before reaching for the speck in our neighbor's eye, so I didn't beat her up with this.  I didn't ask her in an argumentative way why ordination is still considered a ""big deal"" in a denomination which purportedly endorses the ""priesthood of all believers"".  I know my mother regards her own ordination as a great blessing, and a unique opportunity to provide education, consolation and therapy (she's a former psychiatric nurse) to whole groups of people, which has fulfilled and completed and perfected her life.  I'm not going to stomp on all that by arguing that there is something seriously wrong with our Church and its seminaries if it still ordains homophobic Nazis.  My mother quite capable of admitting (in private) that the Church is full of awful, evil trouble-makers.  It's a topic which makes us both feel very sad, though sometimes it's fun to gossip about the bad people.

And this conversation took place before I read the news that a legislator in South Dakota proposed a law (fortunately tabled) allowing murderers to set up a ""justifiable homicide"" defense for killing doctors who provide abortions.  In light of this constant drumbeat of virulent evil in the name of Jesus, however, I think I'll leave my Facebook status just the way it is.

Jesus took delight in paradox and it seems this above all things was the part of my Christian upbringing that left the most lasting impression on me.  In reality, ""Christian Atheist"" isn't a paradox at all, when viewed in light of the critique of ""theism"" offered by Christians like John Selby Spong.  But for people who don't read such books I suppose it's enough of a contradiction to make their heads explode (which I would consider a desirable result).  I understand that most people cannot separate ""theism"" from traditional religious belief, but it was not at all hard for me, as a life-long skeptic about all things ""supernatural"".  Naive faith in miracles, virgin births, immortality of the soul and the like has always struck me as fiction rather than fact.  From childhood it seemed obvious to me that not only were these things unproven and unprovable, but also incoherent.   Entirely aside from truth or falsity, I always wanted to know ""what does that even mean?""

Take the afterlife, for example.  I started reading the New Testament, on my own and without adult guidance, when I was twelve.  I soon ran across an argument between Jesus and the Sadducees about the Resurrection.  (Mark 12:18 et seq.).  ""Doctors of the law"" pose a question to Jesus about a woman whose husband dies, and then according to tradition, she marries her late husband's brother.  This happens seven times until she has been married to seven brothers.  They then ask Jesus: to whom is she married?  Jesus replies that after the Resurrection we have ""spiritual"" bodies and that marriage becomes irrelevant.  So my twelve year old self wanted to know, what the heck is a ""spiritual"" body?  When we affirm ""resurrection of the body"" (as we did in Church whenever we recited the Creeds) what did that mean?   As I got older and my education progressed, I encountered many possible answers to that question: soul, spirit, atman.  I encountered Dante's vision of Paradise as well as Mark Twain's reply that most people have trouble enduring a few hours of hymn-singing let alone all eternity.  I encountered people seriously wondering whether they favorite pet had a soul: will Fluffy be with me in Heaven?  You say ""yes"" and secretly roll your eyes, like you would for a kid who insists on the truth about Santa Claus.  

The turning point in my education was discovering Kierkegaard in college and learning that the contradictions and paradoxes in Christian dogma are not a ""flaw"" in the ""argument"" but rather a very deliberate design feature and intentional manner of communication.  They are like Zen koans: designed to make you think ""outside the box"" (as we so blithely put it these days).  They are like the questions of Socrates, intended to create a state of ""aporia"" by demolishing the safety of false opinions.  They are supposed to be a ""scandal"" and ""offense"": doesn't the Bible say as much?  It has always been explicitly and honestly presented as absurd, at least by people who know what they are talking about, beginning with Jesus and Paul. These are stories we tell to make this life better.  

Now I find the world divides itself into two camps: the few people who understand this and the vast majority who do not.  For decades now, I have proceeded under the assumption that there is an esoteric Christianity for those who understand, and an exoteric Christianity for people who can't be bothered to think about it.  The ""exoteric"" camp includes not only dim-witted ""believers"" in the ""literal truth"" but also an ever-increasing number of militant atheists, people who take the Word literally and superficially and say: ""that's ridiculous!"" without realizing or acknowledging that it's supposed to be ridiculous.  I can hardly fault them for not taking the next required step (the ""leap of faith"" as it were).  It's just not easy, it can cause great personal suffering, and worst of all, many people find themselves trapped midway through the process.  It's like people who take LSD after being promised that it will change the way they look at the world.  For some people that's just what happens, for others it's a ""bad trip"", full of terror and paranoia and never resolving itself upon the clear plateau where the meaning and importance of everything in the sensory world is transformed.  If you don't like the illegal drug analogy then consider the autobiographical statements of saints and teachers.  Luther was constantly plagued with despair about his own sinfulness, to the point of psychosis, and had to ""unceasingly"" reaffirm his sense, understanding and feeling of the grace of God and the truth of the Gospel.  

If that's all there was to it, I might go around the world confidently preaching Christ (and him crucified) with the hope that some few might understand what I really mean.  Preaching to the choir, as it were.  But unfortunately that's not all there is to it.  There is also the political angle to consider. To consider yourself ""in the know"" here, you also have to understand and account for the (very bad) consequences of exoteric Christianity, and the historical fact that the religion was hijacked as the State Religion of the Roman Empire around the year 300 C.E., that a multitude of alternative ""Christianities"" were suppressed by patriarchal councils shortly thereafter.  Ever since the forces of Political Christianity have adapted and modified the religion to support all kinds of truly awful evil institutions, such as slavery, religious war, feudalism, monarchism and fascism.  This abuse of religion for reactionary political agendas continues today with the pro-Life movement, Catholic fascism, and with racism, sexism and homophobia in the Protestants sects (who really ought to know better but amazingly and obviously do not).  Against this sort of thing one has to be unpleasant and unfriendly, to the point of risking misinterpretation.  I'm really a Skeptic, not a throw-the-baby-Jesus-out-with-the-bathwater Atheist.  Given a choice between the dunderhead atheists and virulently evil religious fascists, however, I'm going to side with the atheists every time, thank-you-very-much, because they at least understand liberal democracy.  They don't burn heretics at the stake, or shoot abortion doctors, or blow up office buildings.  As between people who would kill me and people who would bore me with their clumsy critiques, I'll go with being bored."

"event","<blockquote><a href=""http://WhyWontGodHealAmputees.com/summary.htm"">Once we understand why we create religion, we can begin creating the social structures that will replace religion.</a></blockquote>

I was following along, agreeing with everything, until I got to that.  The proffered reasons ""why we create religion"" (to address fear of death, to promote moral ""goodness"") seem percepetive and accurate but somehow incomplete.  Other reasons are addressed throughout the many pages of the site, such as: to alieviate lonliness.  The theist who claims God answered prayer gains attention from his or her peers, belongs to something beyond his or her self ... and the professional ""witness for Christ"" can use testimonial to make money.  But I haven't a clue from that how we might ""begin"" to create ""the social structures that will replace religion.""  I mean, to the extent we haven't already (law, education, science, medicine).  The political dimension seems missing from this website.  I suspect that's a deliberate rhetorical choice, but for the life of me I can't figure out why one would leave that out.  

The arguments set forth at <a href=""http://WhyWontGodHealAmputees.com/"">Why Won't God Heal Amputees?</a> seem to be addressed to a particular kind of person: the ""theist"" sort of conservative Christian who believes that a personal God answers specific prayers for medical treatment.  I don't think such people are going to be persuaded by this approach.  

Superstituous theists are totally impervious to the modern scientific method, that is, the method outlined in Descartes' <i>Discourse on Method</i>: clear and distinct formulation of problems, reducing complex matters to simple cases using mathematics or logic, and proceeding from one empirically verifiable fact to another.  Theists argue from ""authority"", that is: from the Bible, from contemporary authority figures and from the testimonials of other people like themselves.  The site includes more than a few Bible quotes, but assumes a hostile method of exegesis every time.  I have to wonder who this site is really aimed at.

If you have any doubt about how a delusional, ""God Answers Prayer"" sort of Christian would react to this, take a look at this: <a href=""http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/why_wont_god_heal_amputees.html""> Why Does God Hate Amputees? Or, Why Does God Love Marshall Brain?</a>.  This response demonstrates the ""argument from authority"" quite splendidly. 

<lj-cut text=""Read More..."">

Mr. Deem asserts that the arguments in ""Why Won't God Heal Amputees"" are ""quite amateurish.""  Judging by web design, I think ""Amputees"" makes Deem's ""Evidence for God"" look an old Geocities site (which is apparently precisely what it is).  

I suspect what Mr. Deem means by ""amateurish"", however, is not web design.  I suspect what Mr. Deem means that the folks who maintain ""Amputees"" are amateurs in the business of persuading delusional people.  In the business of  ""apologetics"", that is, persuading the kind of idiots who believe God answers prayers to give up their money and votes, I suspect Mr. Deem knows what he is talking about.  He knows his audience.

Yet these are the people ""Amputees"" purports to address.  Page after page it tries to relieve the deluded of their delusions.  So it seems a fair critique: how do such people think, and what sort of argument do they find persuasive?   An authoritarian will want to know <i>who</i> is presenting an argument before scrutinizing the merits, the structure and content... assuming they <i>can</i> deal with the merits.  So the first argument has to be the <i>ad hominem</i>.  Rich Deem demonstrates for us: he starts by asserting that the author of ""Why Won't God Heal Amputees"" is Michael Brain, founder of ""How Stuff Works"".  Mr. Deem says he ""would have more respect"" for Mr. Brain if he had not chosen to present the website anonymously. 

I don't know whether Mr. Deem has the intellectual agility to craft abstract arguments which could, anonymously and without indulging in digressions over personality or authority, go head-to-head with ""Why Won't God Heal Amputees"" .  I suspect not, but that's beside the point.  When folks like Mr. Deem claim to have ""more respect"" if some identifiable person claims authority, that's just a rhetorical flourish, or pure bullshit.  They recognize only the authority of the voice of God which speaks in their head and tells them how to interpret the Bible.  There's really no point in playing along.  As for Rich Deem he runs a ministry in Pasadena (<a href=""http://www.godandscience.org/about.html"">GodandScience.org</a>) devoted to ""Evidence for God"".  Mr. Deem seems to think that people who ""believe in Science"" will respond favorably to what a famous scientist, like Albert Einstein, has said about God.  Anyone with a genuine interest in what Einstein had to say about about God is bound to be disappointed, but we're not talking about genuine intellectual interest here, we're talking about hijacking the authority which science has earned and employing it to further a political agenda.  

Mr. Deem transparently advances a right-wing political agenda.  It only takes one or two clicks to get to the agenda  (the usual: abortion, evolution, hating other kinds of Christians). So we know right away what agenda Mr. Deem is promoting, we know whose ""side"" he's on.  That's important for authoritarians.  Whose side is ""Amputees"" on?  

There are links on every page (after the Home page) to favorable reviews by famous contemporary atheists Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins, but that sort of begs the question.  Yes, we know this is an ""atheist"" web site.  Duh.  But what political agenda does ""Amputees"" promote?  If I switch sides, whose side am I on?  ""Amputees"" discloses (eventually) an agenda promoting reason and justice and practicality (e.g. let's use medicine to cure ailments, not superstition) but that's not a ""side"".  

Anyone can ""believe"" in reason, in universal moral values.  That's not what delusional Christians need to hear.  What they need is a reason to hate some other group of people, in order to feel more powerful and less afraid.  An authoritarian would rather <i>invent</i> some pernicious political agenda and <i>impute</i> it to ""Amputees"" rather than be satisfied with vague appeals to rationality, pragmatism and civilization.  

As for intellectual integrity, fundamentalist Christians have none, of course. ""Amputees"" repeatedly (and I think rather effectively) trashes religious mythology and method.  Does Mr. Deems address any of thise?  Are you kidding?  When he's done calling out Michael Brain, Mr. Deem goes directly to the Gospel of Luke for ""proof"" that God (i.e. Jesus) heals amputees, citing the incident where Jesus restored the ear of a slave which has been struck off by one of Jesus' disciples.  

Mr. Deem does not need to address the systematic deconstruction of Christian literature and method, all he needs to do is say, ""here's your proof: the Bible says so.""  Mr. Deem and his audience <i>just don't care</i> that their argument is circular and that their beliefs are a house of cards, or that they look completely crazy and stupid to others (though we are normally too polite to let them know that). 

Having made the obligatory Bible reference, Mr. Deem then launches into a sermon explicating the hate-theology of human depravity, in which no one is ""worthy"" of having their limbs regrown, so God says ""no"" to any such prayers.  Yet God supposedly ""loves"" everyone (including the purported author of ""Amputees"", Michael Brain) in some way difficult to fathom and never proven. (I'm guessing God will show his ""love"" for Michael Brain by waiting until he dies and then condemning Mr. Brain to eternal torment.  But why wait? Doesn't God already know ... oh, I'm sorry, I was approaching this rationally again).  This is precisely the crappy rationalization which ""Amputees"" demolishes, at length, repeatedly, and without much humor (unless you've never given any of this a thought ever, in which case some of it might strike you as funny).

Which brings me back to the question raised by ""Why Won't God Heal Amputees?""  That is, what function does religion serve? In particular, what function does <i>this</i> religion serve (the one which asserts that Jesus cures cancer)?  

For people who share Mr. Deem's political views against the rule of law, the integrity of science, against political freedom and religious tolerance, their hate-filled God delusion provides a sense of solidarity with others and empowerment in the face of authority. 

For example, on abortion: Mr. Deem's readers probably cannot understand the substantive due process analysis employed by the United States Supreme Court, the notion of the rule of law, or even articulate what criminal punishments would be appropriate if abortion were once again made a crime ... <i>and they don't care</i>.  It just angers them to know that they have no <i>authority</i> to make these decisions.  Some judge's assertion of authority over them diminishes them, makes them feel small and stupid.  (It does not help that they are, in fact, a small group with stupid ideas.)   It's the same with evolution: how dare these ""scientists"" assert authority in such an important field as ... science?  It's the same with religious tolerance and political freedom.  Never mind that we tried it <i>their</i> way for thousands of years and the results were terrible.  It's all about authority, and a belligerent attitude towards all who claim it.  Belligerance ""empowers"" delusional theists personally and politically.  Personally (psychologically) it makes them feel better about themselves, and politically enables them to organize and act locally against their enemies.  

So I've beat this dead horse for several long paragraphs now: ""Why Won't God Heal Amputees?"" doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of persuading Christians that they are delusional, just as Rich Deem's laughable ""evidence"" isn't going to persuade anyone any atheist that Deem's religion is not a psychotic delusion.  In Deem's case we know what the real agenda is: right wing politics and personal enrichment (he's a professional, you see).  In the case of ""Amputees"" I have to wonder who they think they are writing for and what they hope to accomplish.  While it's demonstrably true that most people (if you you ask them the right questions) will reveal that they are neither strong believers nor strong atheists, I don't think this creates a massive ""middle ground"" ripe for persuasion one way or the other.  People pretend to care about religion if that seems socially desirable, but really don't give a crap.  

We don't need to ""understand"" religion or cure religious zealots of their delusions in order to pursue rational social and political policies.  We just create a wall of separation between Church and State and let the zealots live in their ""Church"" ghetto. Religious zealots don't really need action, they need reassurance.  They'll take symbol over substance, because for them it's all about feeling not fact.  An authoritarian U.S. President with the support of Congress could effectively destroy all organized religion above the congregation level (with regulaiton or taxation, say) but if he declared America a ""Christian Nation"" at the same time, the fundamentalists wouldn't care.  In fact, to the extent that such actions would burden the politcal and charitable activities of Catholics, Jews, Muslims and mainline Protestant denominations, the fundies in their little non-denominational ""mega-churches"" would be deleriously happy with that."

"event","Shigeru Miyamoto v. William Shakespeare ...

How many of you know who is told ""... our Princess is in another castle"", and what the Princess' name is?

How many of you know who argued ""the quality of mercy is not strained"" in a trial in a certain Shakespeare play, and who won and who lost in that trial?

Inspired by 

(1) a rather irksome <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/books/review/Suellentrop-t.html?ref=books"">review </a>of what may be a rather good book on video games, ""Extra Lives"" by Tom Bissell.  Giving Roger Ebert a voice in this discussion is ludicrous.  Hew clearly needs to be relegated to teevee expressing shallow opinions on even shallower movies.  

(2) questions from my ten year old about Augustus Caesar (because if you get the top score in Civ4, you are compared to him).  I told him Augustus was not born either Augustus (a title conferred on him by the Senate) nor Caesar (he was adopted by Julius as his successor) which led to me handing him a few paperback copies of various versions of Plutarch's ""Lives"" and commenting that in the olden days, smart boys read these in Latin, but today we are content with translations."

"event","I think all this focus on racial profiling misses the point entirely.  

Under the current interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, you can be stopped any time you are in a motor vehicle: talking on your cell, broken tailight, cracked windshield, dirt obscuring your registration sticker, tinting on your windows, any kind of erratic driving.  That's ""probable cause"" stuff and doesn't even get to the ""reasonable suspicion"" level.  ""Reasonable suspicion"" is mostly about expanding the scope of a stop the officers were already justified in making.

And if the police just want to ask you some questions, you can be stopped any time, anywhere outside your hoome or place of business, as long as they keep it reasonably brief.  This has been considered an exception to the Fourth Amendment since the <i>Terry</i> case (1960s).  They don't even need to suspect you of a crime or see a traffic violation, they just need a reasonable basis to think you might have information about someone <i>else's</i> crimes.  (These ""<i>Terry</i> investigative stops are supposed to be brief and non-intrusive, but there's a great deal of variation: how far can they stretch it?  This is the type of question I research every day.)  

Usually, though, if the police see nothing which gives rise to probable cause, if everyone in the vicinity passes a check for outstanding warrants, if everyone carrying a weapon passes the check for prior felonies or permits if that's required in your State, if you have a valid drivers license and registration ...  they have to let you go.  (That's a lot of ""ifs"", by the way.)

Except now in Arizona they have one more ground to detain you.  This is not a big change in police procedure.  The ""reasonable suspicion"" that someone is an illegal can easily arise in the course of these routine investigative stops, without police relying on racial profiling or a hunch that the person merely looks like a beaner or wetback or whatever they are calling undocumented workers these days.

<lj-cut text=""So if it's not about ""racial profiling"", Hazen, then what is it about?"">

Everyone knows the real deal about illegal immigrants: for the corporate, neo-Fascist world, they are perfect people. They don't demand higher wages or better working conditions.  They don't sue, vote, or pack zoning hearings to complain about your new project.  In the key demographic for criminals (male 18-39) they commit a lot fewer crimes. The pay taxes and demand nothing in return.  And they buy a lot of stuff.  The Church loves them, and they love the Church.  Unlike native-born Americans, who seem to feel they don't need the Church anymore for support and services and are leaving it in droves, they are willing to overlook or forgive the suppression of dissent, the narrow-minded moralizing and yes, the child molesters.  They are the perfect, docile citizenry, because they have no rights as ""citizens"".

Living here in Albuquerque, where it seems about half the Hispanic population is native and the other half immigrant, I think all of the above has <i>nothing</i> to do with Hispanic culture and <i>everything</i> to do with illegal status.  Hispanic New Mexicans know how to raise hell when you mistreat them, and the Mexicans do too, they just don't dare.

Politicians pass restrictive immigration laws to placate organized Labor and Nativists, but they assume these laws will only enforced when illegal immigrants step out of line.  If they ""illegals"" behave they are welcome.  

Teabaggers find this infuriating.  So now in Arizona they are saying: we will make you enforce these laws.  They have directed the local police to adopt a Zero Tolerance approach (don't get me started on the removal of law enforcement discretion, please) but they have also created a private right of action for anti-immigrant organizations to sue law enforcement agencies (complete with attorney's fees to support those organizations).  

I have yet to find a copy of the bill, and reports on this private right of action differ.  Some journalists say ""agencies"" (which would include health, education, and social services, so we would have, like teachers getting sued for not turning in kids' illegal parents) and others say ""law enforcement"" agencies, which sounds more likely to me.  (I would like to know whether they intend to put federal law enforcement under a State waiver of immunity.  That sort of thing gives rise to really tough legal issues).

In New Mexico, when failure to enforce the law (any law, not just immigration law) results in some injury, death, rape, etc., we can sue the police.  But in our cases you have to prove a causal relationship: that the failure to arrest  drunk <i>caused</i> a drunk driving accident later on, for example.  This Arizona law seems to take out the essential notion of ""cause"": you don't have to prove law enforcement failure to pick up an illegal ""caused"" anything bad to happen.  That's a very important restriction which keeps sue-happy lawyers like me in check.

I conclude the Arizona law is a revenue-enhancement scheme for neo-Nazi and Nativist organizations to make money off of lawsuits, at the expense of local Arizona government and the Arizona taxpayers."

"event","I was listening to people going on and on, over the radio about this new Arizona law which allows police to check people's ID.  I heard it also allows for lawsuits against the police if they don't arrest illegals...  leave it to the Republicans to forget all their ""tort reform"" crap in a heartbeat, after one of them comes up with a good new idea for a law enforcement waiver of immunity. But speaking of law enforcement... could it be ... 

This is one of those paranoid conspiracy ideas, but remember, just because you are paranoid doesn't mean that ""They"" aren't out to get you.

Anyway, could it be ... that law enforcement professionals everywhere, especially the kind who wear polo shirts and like to congregate in seminars and participate in ""task forces"" and write grant proposals... could it be these guys have seen the writing on the wall and they know their fabulously lucrative (for them) War on Drugs is about to really cool off?  They and their friends in the private corrections industry must be worried about business.  

The War on Drugs was great because there was always a practically infinite supply of people to arrest and put in jail.  You could never exhaust it.  But now, what with people talking about legalizing marijuana and who knows what else ... maybe they look at illegal immigrants as the next great inexhuastible supply of people to arrest and jail.  Maybe?"

"event","So... for some reason I was talking with son Ben about school sports and bragging about the guys I played volleyball with in high school, and how a couple of them got on the USA Olympic volleyball team but we'll never know whether they could have won gold because the Olympics were cancelled that year.  (Moscow).  Ben thought the Moscow boycott was bullshit, and I agreed.  But now I'm thinking of cancelling his Grand Canyon camping trip this summer because I want to boycott Arizona.  

Bullshit or not?

"event","I love my job, the way my practice is currently set up, because when I stand up to argue in Court, or sit down to write a brief: <i>I'm always right.</i>  I know that sounds delusional, but you have to understand that there's a filtering process involved.  

If a client thinks they have a case, they take it to a lawyer.  That's step one.  If the lawyer agrees they have a case, the lawyer agrees to take it on.  That's step two.  Then the lawyer looks at his or her huge case load and thinks: I have to get this stuff moving.  I'll pick the very best cases and hire outside help (namely, me).  That's step three.  Then I review the case and say: these are the best points to get this thing moving.  That's step four.  So by the time I get to work, we're down to the very best points of the very best cases.  

So whatever I'm writing or talking about, I'm always right.  Neat, huh?  That doesn't mean we always win. ""Against stupidity the gods themselves contend in vain.""  But dammit, we should."

"event","The correct terms to describe the judiciary in the United States are ""conservative"" and ""neo-Fascist"".  

Justice Stevens isn't a ""liberal"".  He's a conservative, in the mold of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., whose famous dissent in the <i>Lochner</i> case stated:

<blockquote>This case is decided upon an economic theory which a large part of the country does not entertain. If it were a question whether I agreed with that theory I should desire to study it further and long before making up my mind. But I do not conceive that to be my duty, because I strongly believe that my agreement or disagreement has nothing to do with the right of a majority to embody their opinions in law ... a constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory, whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the State or of laissez faire. It is made for people of fundamentally differing views, and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>

That, my friends, is judicial conservatism.  And it is the guiding philosophy of all so-called ""liberal"" judges for the past 100 years.  They are only called ""liberal"" because they refuse to toe the Party line on racism, misogyny and homophobia.  And when I say ""the Party"" I'm not sure anymore whether I mean the Republicans. There is troubling evidence that the Republican party no longer exists, and that all we have left are entertainers, Brown Shirts (Teabaggers) and the plutocratic oligarchs who pull their strings.

I call it ""neo"" Fascism.  I have to ""neo"" because there are some important distinctions between the American version and the historical German and Italian parties.  One key difference is that our American fascists have to deal with lingering antipathy from their first attempt to abolish the Constitution and install a proto-Fascist oligarchy (the Civil War, of course).  Being on the losing side of World War II doesn't help them much either.  

History can be overcome, though.  You just re-write it.  It's a mere public relations problem.  A much more significant difference is the absence of a powerful, state-financed Church in America.  

Mussolini and even the Nazis could enlist the Catholic hierarchy in their cause.  (Bavaria, where the Nazis got their start, was a Catholic state). The Nazis later easily co-opted the majority Lutheran Church in regions where it was the established, government-financed and controlled Church.  The Lutheran Church in Germany had a long history of anti-semitism and anti-communism.  Long before Karl Marx, Luther himself was denouncing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasants&#39;_War"">communists</a>.  For hundreds of years, the Church had extensive legal jurisdiction, and could hand over heretics to the temporal authorities to be executed, or indict entire nations as the proper object of a Crusade.  Much of this influence had withered by the 20th Century, but it still meant something when a pastor gave a sermon against the Jews or a cardinal denounced labor unions.  Without the backing of Churches, I doubt the Nazis could have prevailed in the Crusades against the Jews and Communists.  

We don't have a state-sponsored Church here.  The powers and influences that the Church exercised in Italy and Germany have been dispersed to other insitutions in America: a more robust public education system, more robust media and ""Hollywood"" (which absorbs the time and attention of the American public to an extent which religious leaders can only dream about). 

Above all, however, the Church's function as problem solver and disputer resolver has been supplanted in the United States by a more robust <i>judicial branch of government</i>.  This has been a cultural as well as technical, structural change.  The Nazis had no trouble taking over the German legal system because it had no common law, it had no Constitutional tradition of anti-majoritarian veto, it had no national traditional of an independent, professional bench and bar even remotely comparable to American lawyers, and it had no broad power to effect (or resist) social change like the American legal system today.  The reason for this is simple: German and Italy didn't unify as <i>nations</i> until the 1870s.  Powerful national institutions like an independent judiciary take time to develop.  Ours did not appear instantly upon the ratification of the Constitution, but had to go through steps like <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>; the consolidation of federal legal authority after the Civil War and the use of federal troops to enforce it during the Reconstruction; the gradual, step-by-step ""incorporation"" of the Bill of Rights into the 14th Amendment to apply to the States; the reform of legal education and introduction of bar exams in the late 19th century, and so on and so forth.

Now litigation consumes an amount of time, money and attention in the United States which is simply unprecedented in Western Civilization.  Today, if an American has a problem, <i>any</i> kind of problem, they bring it to the courts.  We look to our courts to persaude and if necessary force parties to resolve their differences: a role which the Church played in Europe after the demise of the Roman Empire.  And just like the Church was in Europe, our legal system can be corrupted, and already has been to a large extent.

To be sure, the Nazis liked to have legal ""cover"" for their crimes, but the Nazis never took the risk of submitting a case to an independent judiciary: that would have been unthinkable for them.  Unless the result was foreordained, they didn't bother.  The same is true of our neo-Fascists, like the Bush Administration.  When the Bushies wanted legal ""cover"" for their crimes (torture, spying on citizens) they went to their own legal hacks and avoided the independent judiciary (like the FISA court) wherever possible.  There's a huge difference between getting the support of an independent judiciary and ordering up a memo from neo-Fascist hack.  No matter what the issue, no matter what the Constitution or prior case law says, a hack rules for the Party.  It's just that simple.  

Lately, the Party seems to be abandoning even the veneer of legal theorizing and just indulges in pure calumny.  ""Activist"" is deprecated in favor of the vague and content-free epithet ""radical"", or more wordy phrases like ""out of touch with mainsteam American values"", which appears to me nothing more than: this judge ruled against the Party.  If you find my nuanced term ""neo-Fascist"" needlessly provocative, try listening carefully when the Republicans talk about the judge who the President nominates to replace Justice Stevens.  All the people on Obama's short list are totally ""conservative"" under any reasonable definition of that word.  Every last one of them.  So when they talk about ""liberal"" or ""radical"" or ""extreme"" or ""out of touch with mainsteam American values"", what they mean is that nominee is an independent legal thinker who has ruled against the Party in one or maybe two cases.  For our neo-Fascists, that is utterly intolerable."

"event","Lots a punditry about how Justice Stevens' retirement will inevitably result in a more conservative Court kind of misses a more important point.  The Supreme Court hears very few cases.  A Supreme Court decision can, in many cases, simply be ignored by the lower courts.  (They don't call it that: they call it ""distinguishing"" a case ""on the facts"".  But it amounts to the same thing.)  All those lower level (District and Appeals level) courts are far more important to our daily lives, and those in turn depend on a solid majority in the U.S. Senate.  Changing the filibuster rules at the beginning of the next session of Congress is a critical factor in this."

"event","Right-wingers ""project"" their intentions on the rest of us. This makes them scared, because they don't want to be on the receiving end of the kind of police action they like to inflict on others.

Take, for example, this <a href=""http://dante-atkins.dailykos.com/"">DailyKos diary</a> about a confrontation between some right-wing jerk-off and Al Franken.  A teabgger confronted Senator Franken about a certain provision ""that requires employers to provide lactating mothers with time to extract milk.""  The teabagger is outraged that the government will now have ""milk police"".  Now, that's not how liberal operate.  If an employer uses a dispute over ""lactation"" to take ""adverse employment action"" against a mother (firing, demotion, etc.) there will be a lawsuit.  No police, not even bureaucrats going over records to ensure that time off for lactation has been given, unless there is adverse action and a complaint.  

Right-wingers imagine a ""milk police"", however.  They like force, violence and vengeance, and disproportionate response, so they project those methods onto us.  Police can use a mere suspicion of drugs in my house as an excuse to invade it, seize my house, vehicles and cash, point guns at my children and hold me in jail indefinitely, without any real evidence and with total impunity.  They have a similar approach to obscenity: busting down doors, seizing papers and computers, prison and permanent public humilation and invitations to vigilante violence against ""sex offenders"".

Imagine if we reacted to the Oklahoma City Bombing the same way we reacted to 9/11. Forget Waco: consider what we've done in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Oklahoma would have been invaded and all Republicans detained and tortured.  We'd see pictures of pyramids of naked Republicans threatened by dogs, held for years without trial or hearing. We'd be told that Idaho has WMDs, as an excuse to invade that state to go after neo-Nazis there.  Whole cities would be leveled and Idaho's infrastructure destroyed.  Refugees would flee to Canada, and Mormon would girls would be forced to prostitute themselves on the streets of Calgary just so their families could eat.  The people remaining in Idaho would splinter into armed militias and shoot and bomb each other on a daily basis while federal troops and mercenaries would spray minivans with bullets when soccer moms failed to slow down fast enough at a military checkpoint...

Right-wingers are right to fear this stuff.  If justice were meted out upon right-wingers as they judge others, if a just God were to ""forgive our trespasses, <i>as we forgive those who trespass against us</i>"" ... they'd be in for a world of hurt."

"event","Sarah Palin recently had this to say...

<blockquote>That bumper sticker that maybe you'll see on the next Subaru driving by -- an Obama bumper sticker -- you should stop the driver and say, ""So how's that hopey, changey thing workin' out for ya?""</blockquote>

Here in New Mexico, it is perfectly legal to carry a gun in your car.  Under Section 66-8-124, of the New Mexico Statutes, only duly commissioned and <i>uniformed</i> law enforcement officers can perform a traffic stop. Impersonating a police officer is a criminal offense ... but only a misdemeanor for the first offense, so the legal status of making a citizen's arrest is dicey at best.  But you can at least defend yourself, so the proper and legal response would be to point your gun at the Teabagger and say:

<blockquote><a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2010/3/30/852426/-So-hows-that-hopey,-changey-thing-workin-out-for-ya"">Pretty well, actually. </a> Now, back off, <i>pendejo</i>!</blockquote>

"event","My own personal experiences with the Catholic Church and Catholicism have always been very positive, as an outsider.  During my highschool years I was generously welcomed into Catholic choirs (even though I am not Catholic) and even got to perform in a beautiful cathedral in Washington, D.C..  Growing up I have been inspired by the words and deeds of peace activists, liberation theologians, and ecumenical scholars who all happen to be priests.  I attended a traditionally Catholic college to get my teaching certificate, and there finally learned some Calculus from a Christian Brother, when I had repeatedly failed to understand it before.  

Living in northern New Mexico I have been exposed to an indigenous form of religious faith and practice involving pilgrimages, the saints and the passion of Christ, and the elevation of a New World earth goddess to the Queen of Heaven, and intercessor for the poor, the oppressed and the sick and addicted.  All this exists despite the Church, in stubborn defiance of the hierarchy.  All this exists despite the fact that the Church used a monastery in New Mexico as a notorious dumping ground for pedophile priests.  Even as an outsider I cannot help but be aware of the agony of the laity betrayed repeatedly by its leadership.  

While mainline Protestant churches like the one I was raised in are in decline, the decline is nowhere near as fast as the Catholic Church in America, with the <a href=""http://pewresearch.org/databank/dailynumber/?NumberID=494"">Pew Center</a> estimating that 10% of all Americans are ex-Catholics.  The losses have only been offset by Catholic immigrants, mostly Hispanic but also some Asians and Africans.

As an outsider I can, without hesitation and fear, point to the maggots who feast on the corpse of the Church and ask why they are allowed to interfere with the politics of the United States of America.  As digby puts it:

<a href=""http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/useful-stupak.html""><blockquote>Powerful leaders who will cover up for pedophiles aren't likely to give a damn about the plight of the uninsured.</blockquote></a>

One thousand six hundred years (since the councils at Nicea and Chalcedon and the establishment of a universal, orthodox Church) seems like a long time, but the pagan polytheistic religions of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece were around for a lot longer before they were displaced by Christianity and Islam, rather suddenly in these broad historical terms."

"event","If I were Emperor of the USA, this would be my program:
Spending
<ol start=1>
<li>Reduce U.S. overseas military operations. 
<li>Stop selling arms and funding foreign military.
<li>Single-payer, ""Medicare for all"" health and elderly care. 
<li>Phase out government contractors; fire managers who out-source for more than one (1) year.  
<li>Bring back ""privateers"" by granting ""Letters of Mark and Reprisal"" to whistleblowers and their lawyers to sue for fraud by government contractors.
<li>Encourage the Old South to secede from the Union again.
</ol>
Taxes and Revenue
<ol start=1>
Rich People:
<li>No more ""double taxation"" for long term (10 years) investments: they are excluded from income as long as they are held. 
<li>All ""taxable events"" before 10 years convert the capital gain to ordinary income to be taxed at new, confiscatory rates. 

The rest of us:
<li>Drastically simplify and standardize the tax code, with progressive (pre-Reagan) tax rates and structure.  
<li>Standardize all remaining individual deductions based on historical IRS figures.
<li>Allow special deductions and credits on an application-only basis, with disclosure of information needed to evaluate the tax policy.
<li>If you don't like disclosure then you get the standard tax deductions and rates.
<li>Consolidate all payroll taxes and income tax withholding and all ""Social Security"" style investments (IRAs, etc.) into a single two-tiered Federal Tax and Benefits account, with ""savings"" and ""checking"" components, which (unlike the current system) would be transparent to the taxpayer.
<li>Income deposited in the federal ""checking"" account gets taxed at a lower rate.  You can take advantage of this lower rate by having your entire paycheck deposited in this account, which can then be used like a full service retail checking account with debit cards, online banking and the works. 
<li>Minimum mandatory withholding is deposited in, and Income tax is paid from the ""savings"" account monthly. 
<li>Social Security and voluntary retirement funds also go in the ""savings"" account.
<li>People receiving a regular paycheck will have their tax rates adjusted as often as they receive a paycheck.
<li>If you stop getting a paycheck for any reason, unemployment insurance kicks in at 2/3 of 52 week avg. pay until terminated.
<li>Unemployment insurance can't be terminated for wage loss resulting from permanent disability.
<li>Everyone not receiving a regular paycheck will still have to file returns at least annually (with the option to file more often if your income goes down).
<li>Private banks and credit unions can manage these Federal Tax and Benefit funds as long as they provide specified minimum services and charge no fees for those services, but the default arrangement is with the United States Treasury / IRS.
<li>Disclosure of account information to law enforcement (other than the IRS) requires a warrant on probable cause, disclosure to anyone else is unathorized, a felony AND grounds for a Section 1983 civil lawsuit for money damages.

Business Entities and Institutions
<li>Most deductions and imaginary expense items (""depreciation"") will be abolished
<li>The value of the compensation to the lowest paid U.S. resident employee, or the federal minimum wage, whichever is higher, sets the deduction from revenues allowed for compensation and benefits paid to all higher-paid officers, employers and individual contractors of all business entities subject to U.S. tax.
<li>End tax-free status for all organizations, <i>especially</i> religious ones.
<li>Give states and localities the option to get on the federal gravy train, provided they repeal all state and local taxes.
Misc.
<li>Tax patent and copyright revenues in graduated amounts that increase over time. 
<li>Abrogate all international tariff and trade agreements and reinstate high tariffs, as was the Original Intent and Practice of the Founders.
<li>Legalize recreational drugs; regulate them like alcohol and tax them like cigarettes.  
</ol>
Energy
<ol start=1>
<li>End all tax incentives for oil production and replace them with excise taxes (domestic) or tariffs (foreign), then repeal the gas tax.
<li>Convert all federal ground transportation to electric.  
<li>Convert all federal buildings to energy self-sufficient, off-grid facilities. 
<li>Where and when solar and wind are not enough, use fuel cells charged in federal generating stations.
<li>End subsidies for ethanol produced with food (corn, cane sugar) and increase subsidies for biofuels or electrical generation from inedible waste products.
<li>Set challenging goals for energy related research, throw money at public research institutions (national labs and universities) to meet these goals, and reward instiutional success with the right to auction off any intellectual property created to the highest bidder.  
</ol>
Space Exploration
<ol start=1>
<li>Set a worthy goal, like Terra-forming Mars using volatiles from the Oort Cloud.
<li>Build heavy-lift launch vehicles
<li>Launch them daily from a place where the weather allows that (not Florida!)
<li>Clean up the orbital junk
<li>Build permanent orbital and Lagrange Point facilities shielded with enough water to protect crew from solar flares
<li>Launch a million tiny solar-sail robots to the Oort Cloud
<li>Sell Martian real estate to the Chinese
<li>Launch people I don't like into the Sun.
</ol>"

"event","I have this notion I'm going to exploit my DotMac account to make a professional blog page.  (DotMac is now DotMe... in the ongoing effort of Apple No-Longer Computers, Inc. to distance itself from its line of desktop computers.  I find their lack of faith <i>disturbing</i>.)  All of you who want to advise me I shouldn't use iWeb to make the blog should just shut it, right now.  It can be arranged to use my own domain name, should I choose to obtain such a thing, which I doubt I will.   If I get rolling with this --and the point of today's post is that I most likely won't-- maybe I'll throw some money at this, but I doubt it.

There are many lawyer web pages out there which reflect someone's decision to spend a lot of money on marketing and then neglect to add any content. ""Neglect"" is probably too strong a word.  There are lots of ethical and professional issues with respect to lawyers writing about what they do for public consumption.  I would love to repeat everything I hear, read or see in the course of a day.  Some of it is downright hilarious and would be fun to write about.  There's plenty of material there both humorous and politically significant, morally significant, even ... but there are a range of rules, written and unwritten, ranging from the very serious lawyer-client confidentiality to simply a matter of good taste, which prevent me from writing about my own work.

None of that would prevent me from writing about <i>other</i> lawyer's cases, though. I thought I had the perfect example: the City of Albuquerque was recently denied certiorari by the United States Supreme Court in a zoning case. I used to do zoning law and I am even quite familiar with this particular case.  It's been pending for 15 years and there have been several State appellate decisions which I have duly read and applied in my work.  This case isn't <i>my</i> case, however, so I have no professional scruples expressing any and all opinions I might have.

However, when I read what I wrote, I found it boring, <i>even to me</i>.

<lj-cut text=""Read more if you want, but you've been duly warned."">

The upshot of ""denial of cert"" is that now the City will have to pay a judgment for $11 million dollars (at last count, likely 1 or 2 million more when interest and attorney's fees are added).  The very next day the City announced that it was looking at job cuts and furloughs and non-specified ""other ways"" to address a $53 million budget shortfall.  The new mayor is even making noises about breaching the City's contracts with its unions, under the not-very-legal notion that they were negotiated by the previous mayor and shouldn't burden this one.  In short, the City's legal department and mayor(s) fucked up big time, and now they are going to make other people, their loyal employees, pay the consequences.  

All this to support an argument that when the City makes new zoning sector plans, this constitutes ""legislation"" and they can do whatever the fuck they want, whenever they want, to whoever they want.  

That's complete and utter bullshit.  The obvious potential for corruption is made even more obvious by the facts of this case.  There's a big area of empty land right in the middle of ""Uptown"" (Albuquerque's second ""downtown"" area with --at the time, 1995-- two major shopping malls, a half dozen office towers, located right off the main East-West freeway... in short, the center of the City now that's based on cars, rather than the railroads which were the hub of the old Downtown area).  This particular parcel, however, had never been developed because it was owned by the city's premiere parochial high school (which ended up building a new high school in a completely different part of town).  The proposed shopping mall was an obvious use for this parcel, obvious to the point where, in the intervening 15 years, an ""upscale"" shopping mall (Apple store, Pottery Barn, you name it) is just what went up on an enjoining parcel.  

So what was the problem?  Traffic?  There was going to be traffic no matter what.  In the intervening 15 years, the State/City/Feds have expended millions to upgrade the freeway exit at exactly this spot. All factors point to... <i>someone</i> wanted this project to fail and that <i>someone</i> had clout with the City council.  A case of political corruption pure and simple.  

But even ""corruption"" doesn't explain why the City decided to litigate this forever on the ridiculous ground that the City can do whatever the fuck it wants in zoning cases.  I use the unsafe-for-Court term ""whatever the fuck they want"" because the accepted lawyerly term is ""police power"".  That's confusing.  It has nothing to do with the police department or law enforcement as we all understand it.  I means the power of a city, as a local level government (unlike State or federal government which are limited by constitutions` and rules and shit) to make any laws it wants to address any problems it has, with little or no interference from courts at any level.  

You want to outlaw loud breathing within the city limits?  Ducks on leashes? Fine: go for it.  Anything you want, you got it.  If you don't believe me look up one of those ""silly laws"" websites.  There are, of course, limits on local ""police power"": State statute for one.  New Mexico statutes on ""zoning"", however, are pretty vague and leave a lot of room for interpretation, and necessarily so because zoning issues are local issues.  

There's more, though.  Looming over this whole cozy arrangement, this potential sphere for the unchecked, unfettered abuse of government power in the service of private money and power, way back in the mists of time and buried in student text books which everyone forgets the minute they pass the bar exam, is a little thing called the 14th Amendment, and its curious phrase: ""due process"". 

The reason (I think) that the City thought they could get away with it here: New Mexico appeals courts have for some time treated zoning issues as pure statutory issues without mentioning ""due process"".  And as I noted above, our State statutes (and most state statutes) leave zoning pretty much up to the discretion of local government.  looking only at the laws on the books, it's hard not to conclude that the City can, indeed, do whatever the fuck it wants, any time, to anyone.  ""Due process"" has been silently invoked (<i>sub silentio</i> I think the Latin phrase is) by mentioning ""fairness"" in procedure, but the appeals courts more often than not invoke ""police power"" as the default rule: zoning laws are presumed correct unless it can be shown otherwise.  How do you show otherwise?  Well you can read 30 or so pages of legalese which appears to be state sort of rule or rationale, but the bottom line is always: Ha-ha, you can't.  So the City's lawyers thought they could win on essentially technical grounds ""this zoning change was passed by the City Council and therefore is a 'law' and can be crammed down people's throats and fairness and facts be damned"" since, well, a lot of (poorly reasoned and badly written) New Mexico cases seem to imply just that.

What those cases should have said was: this isn't unfair <i>enough</i> to invoke the Constitution to overrule the zoning change, with the appropriate reference to the technical standards for what is fair (and what isn't) in due process law, like our State courts did back in the 1970s (when men were men and law was law, dammit).  But in recent years they shoved all that under the carpet, invoked ""poh-leese power"" and a whole bunch of technical zoning goobble-dee-gook to protect a corrupt system in which you needed clout to fix things for your project.  

And by ""they"" I mean a small circle of real estate lawyers and developers and development professionals and their pals on the appellate courts. This is all just my opinion, man, and I'm not going to name names or offer proof.  I don't want to get fucking sued, and anyway, times have changed and power relations shifted and <i>oh look at that: another of the City's biggest real estate brokers is about to go ""poof"" in an Enron-like maelstrom of securities fraud!</i>  This is all ancient history at this point, so why bother.  

Also, my enthusiasm for delving into the sordid details of this has significantly waned after giving it some thought.  The conclusions I reach fit perfectly into the rightwing narrative of ""government bad, private sector good"".  I don't want to have any part in supporting this narrative publicly, even if it's true.  

For you, my limited circle of friends, I will say that here it's pretty clear ""the government"" (City) indulged in frivolous litigation and delay which a private sector entity <i>could never get away with</i>.  You see, if this were a dispute between two commercial entities, their insurance carriers would have resolved it a long, long time ago for a lot less than $11 million dollars, at least half that, probably much less.  In fact, New Mexico insurance statutes would have demanded that: they define ""bad faith"" as failing to promptly settle a case ""<b>when liability is reasonably clear</b>"".    For those of you who don't know, ""bad faith"" is very bad for insurers.  Among other things, insurers can be held liable for more than the limits of their policy, more than their contract amount and reserves set aside to pay the claim.  That can mean bankruptcy, loss of investment rating... it can be the corporate ""death penalty"" with a sufficient large judgment and a relatively small or undercapitalized insurer.  And with big insurers it means ""heads will roll"" in middle management.  So, insurers stop litigating and start negotiating ""when liability is reasonably clear""... or else.

And in this case, liability has been ""reasonably clear"" from the outset.  Can you change the zoning rules to make them more restrictive (we lawyers call that ""downzoning"") and apply them to a particular project after the paperwork has been filed for zoning approval?  Of course not.  Can you get around that by denying a hearing to a developer where the developer can show: yes, we filed before this change so it doesn't apply to us?  Of course not.  Yet, the City managed to convince the New Mexico Court of Appeals, and after that ruling was overruled by the State's highest court, hired some fancy DC law firm and paid them <i>another</i> 50 grand (after spending millions on their own lawyers) to make an utterly pointless and meritless appeal to the SCOTUS.  It was all a massive waste of time and taxpayer money. All in the service of establishing ""precedent"" saying, no, you can't do whatever the fuck you want in zoning cases.

This is why I don't do zoning anymore and restrict my practice to suing the government for more traditional ""civil rights"" violations."

"event","Marxist terms and ideas need a serious update.  There's probably people out there doing this but I haven't even sharpened my thinking to know where to look, or recognize what I find.  Floundering around here...

<lj-cut text=""Read More..."">

Class

It seems pretty clear that the classic ""proletarian/bourgeoisie"" terminology is as obsolete as a buggy whip.

When the old feudal aristocratic orders were being liquidated by the rising ""middle class"" industrial capitalists, it made sense to talk about the ""bourgeoisie"", the class that was incubated in cities, towns and villages until it finally managed to mass enough wealth and power to completely displace the ""aristocracy"", the old, decentralized ruling class whose wealth was founded on the ownership of agricultural land.

Now anything and everything can be a ""means of production"".  Land? Yes.  Capital (in the sense of buildings and stuff)?  Sure.  But also legal rights and licenses, protected forms of expression, technical data such as gene sequences, a blob of cancer cells long ago extracted from a patient and replicated millions of times... basically anything that isn't used up after sale (a commodity) but rather persists and keeps on producing a profit.  We lawyers call that stuff ""property"", which is as good a word as any.

In my case, if someone were to ask me what my most valuable item of ""property"" was, I'd assume they meant ""asset"" and say my house.  Really, though, my most valuable property is my law license.  It's not transferable all at once (I can't grant you the right to play lawyer) and therefore has no price-based value.   I sell it off in 6 minute slices which add up to ""billable hours"".  While I, like most professionals, like to think that people hire me because I'm ""smart"" and ""experienced"" and can solve problems (and of course I market myself that way) what people are paying for is not these virtues of character but rather the license.  I can also counsel people with emotional problems (and my job as a lawyer has given me plenty of experience with that) but I'm not a licensed psychiatrist or counselor so I can't sell that.  While I make fun of lawyers who attach an ""Esq."" to their names, the law license is really very much like an old title of nobility when that meant something (when it was attached to a bundle of rights with respect to a particular collection of real estate).

That's just one form of ""property"", though.  Professionals aren't at all the new ""bourgeoisie"".  We are not a distinct ""ruling"" class.  We are owned lock-stock-and-barrel by the self-proclaimed ""Masters of the Universe"", the ""Wall Street"" financial elite who ""own"" 90% of everything ""ownable"".  Who are these people?  What do we call them?  Coming up with name seems to be hard, as if deliberately ... obscured.  Ideas of ""ownership"" are likewise obscured.  Corporations are now often owned mostly by institutions which hold aggregated funds: State employee retirement funds, for example.  ""Ownership"" in the technical sense is diluted, but control seems to be where it's always been.  

To call them ""capitalists"" conjures up activities which they long ago stopped doing, like inventing products and then buying the equipment to manufacture them.  They like to call investment contracts of various kinds ""products"" but that seems to me to bend and stretch the notion well past breaking point.  It seems to be part of a disinformation, propaganda and semantic dilution campaign, intended to subvert real class struggle in the classic Marxist sense.  ""See? We're just like you!  We work and make 'products'!""  Yeah, right. 

You can say ""rich"" and ""poor"" but that's bland and essentially meaningless, especially for a Marxist who wants his terms to have some historical content and relevance.

Colonialism / Imperlialism

Circa 1848, the colonial operation was pretty simple: fund a military operation, take over some territory, enslave the local population and/or start importing workers, and build a resource extraction machine.  In those days it seemed the model of profit was to locate your manufacturing base in the home country and send out manufactured at a ridiculously high, tariff inflated price.  Unfortunately, this model encouraged colonies to declare independence. That model in its original form, with slave labor and ham-fisted tax and tariff policies, is dead.  

All the various European national colonial operations have been consolidated, moved to New York City and then reconfigured into administrative regions (much as Rome moved to Constantinople and then split into East and West).  And today the Empire cultivates local elites who import everything, even their children's educations, from the Empire, but still maintain an illusion of independence and local control (like, say, Mexico).  

Natural resource extraction is no longer the only profit-making colonial model: the raw material can be low wage labor or a place to dump toxic waste. The Empire is global now and you can't seize control of any part of it with armed revolution or peaceful political process.  Those things just give you control of a ""nation"", and nations are irrelevant now (and that goes double for political parties and the legislative bodies they are designed to control).  The old-style Communists could see this coming and at least talked about an ""international labor movement"", but in practice they just made more ""nations"", and those nations were eventually forced to abandon Communism, leaving the workers of the world with nothing in the way of an ""international labor movement"" except the quaint vestiges of trade unions.

Probably the reason why militant fundmentalist Islam has to be demonized as ""terrorism"" is that, at least to the extent it is trans-national, it's the closest thing to a threat to the Empire that exists."

"event","Health Care Summit; Senator Tom Coburn, M.D. (R-OK), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?CID=N00005601"">health care industry</a>, managed to make me want to throw all the doctors under the bus (even though a lot of my friends are doctors) by using the term ""extortion"" to describe medical malpractice suits. Senator Coburn is a filthy rich gas-bag who uses overblown rhetoric to describe efforts to hold him accountable for his errors.  His contribution to a sensible policy debate on this matter is to drop his drawers and shit on it. 

Like most plaintiff's lawyers (I suppose) I get lots and lots of calls and referrals ro do medical malpractice lawsuits, even though that's not my speciality.  I do the job of screening them: get the medical records, review them and forward them to a guy I know from law school, a dual M.D./J.D. who knows his stuff. Most of the time we tell the family ""sorry, that wasn't a clear case of malpractice"" or ""he would have died anyway"".  This is not a fun thing to have to tell people.

One exception was a woman whose son died of a ruptured appendix.  This case goes right to the heart of the ""unnecessary"" tests and ""defensive medicine"" issue.  Most people who go to the emergency room or urgent care with abdominal pains and high fever do NOT have appendicitis.  So doing the blood test recommended by emergency physicians is a total waste, some really high percentage of the time (maybe 99%).  For that remaining 1%, however, it's a life-and-death issue.  Weighing the low benefit against the very high cost, emergency physicians go with the test.  But this kid wasn't at the emergency room.  He saw a nurse at an urgent care facility, and she said ""you just have a tummy ache and the flu"" (or words to that effect) and did not order the test.  Appendix ruptured, kid died. So we sued the HMO and won.  

Extortion?  No doctors were threatened with a black mark on their record here, and frankly, the HMO and any doctor with malpractice insurance can afford to put on a defense like I've never seen in any other area of the law.  We're talking scorched earth, Nazis-retreating-from-Russia style defense.  There was no ""extortion"" involved here, nor (I'd bet) in the cases brought against Senator Coburn for his medical errors.   What was involved was holding for-profit health corporations to account for a financial decision not to engage in ""defensive medicine"" and instead let people die.  Nobody told the parent of this now dead child that she would have to give up her son so that everyone else can save a few bucks.  This HMO doesn't advertise the fact that they keep premiums low by letting 1 out of 100 of you die.

I don't think the objective of a ""medical malpractice"" system should be aimed at blaming doctors or even reducing malpractice.  The legal system is a terrible way to achieve that kind of accountability.  It's not even very good at compensating people who are the victims of medical errors: it's kind of like a lottery, in which many people participate but only a few receive (perhaps inflated) awards.  To make it work, what we need is a system like the workers compensation system wherein payouts are standardized and held low, and in exchange, they are made promptly and without allowing doctors and health care corporations to spend millions on defense.  In my state, worker's compensation lawyer's fees on both sides are capped at $16k per case: I'd like the see a malpractice defense lawyer do a case on that kind of budget.  <i>That</i> would be extortion in many cases, but it's what Seantor Coburn and his ilk deserve.

In the meantime, you better believe I won't be taking my kids to any ""urgent care"" or participating in any HMO that doesn't allow me to take them to the government-run University Hospital."

"event","For me there are many disturbing synchronicities in Thomas Pynchon's <i>Inherent Vice</i>.  I begin to suspect that one of you mooks is really the notriously reclusive writer, cribbing notes from my brain.  Or not: the ""chronology"" is all wrong for me.   The book is set in 1969, when I was 10.  So I hazard a guess: 

Is Larry ""Doc"" Sportello the ""eye"" for something that landed like a mile wide asteroid in LA about '69 and kicked up a giant mushroom cloud of pulverized psychic debris, which the prevailing winds then spread all over the 70s (and thus over me)?

A-and what's up with the ""ups"" (used whenever most of us would write ""oops"" or ""whoops"")?  Is this SoCal pronunciation or his own little quirk?"

"event","Correct me if I'm wrong, but since FDR proposed his court-packing scheme, no President has told off the Supreme Court the way Barack Obama did last night in the State of the Union.  Just as the President was saying """"last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections""  one of the Justices, Samuel Alito, <a href=""http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/01/alito-appears-to-mouth-definitely-not-true-after-obama-criticizes-court-decision.php?ref=fpblg"">appeared to be saying ""definitely not true""</a>.

I've skimmed <i>Citizens United</i> (which is about all the time I can give something like that which is outside my practice focus) and I can't understand why Justice Alito might have objected to the President's characterization.  

<b>If that's <i>not what they meant</i>, then perhaps they should have had Justice Kennedy make that clear in the majority opinion.</b>

It's not like these guys don't have <i>time</i> to get it exactly right.  It's not like they don't have <i>help</i> from an army of clerks.  It's not like they have to leave their chambers and preside over a trial.  They don't have to chat with worried clients, pick up the kids at school, record their billable hours, review their trust account transactions, pay their lease and utility bills or any of the thousand other things any lawyer (not to mention, the President of the United States) has to deal with at the same time as drafting important legal documents.

Update:  digby nails it:

<blockquote>""And anyway, I think that any justice who thinks that unregulated free speech for corporations is sacred while the speech of some kid with a sign that says ""bong hits 4 Jesus"" can be suppressed has already amply embarrassed himself.""</blockquote>"

"event","On the perennial theme of the degradation of language by technology: you know the sort of thing I'm referring to.  Some boomer or even more aged person, observes his/her child/grandchild doing some texting and immediately leaps to the conclusion that the compressed and colloquial features of electronic communication will be the death of longer, more thoughtful narratives possible with more tradition printed-on-paper written expression.  

If I meet these people in person, I always want ask (and if I am in a particularly nasty mood, I do ask) if they have read Plato's Phaedrus.  In that dialogue Socrates encounters one of his young friends using the latest techno-gadget of the day: he has a scroll with a speech on it, written by some other guy, which he is trying to memorize by repeating it out loud.  There follows a long dialogue about the difference between written wisdom and more free-floating oral communication (along with the issue of thinking for yourself rather than assimilating another's dead, static thoughts).  True: the introduction of writing for the Greeks killed the tradition of reciting epic poetry from memory.  To think that the Illiad and the Odyssey were once recited out loud... they were probably only recited in part, or episodes, and only gathered together in the form we know today once writing allowed that, but still, pretty amazing.  On the other hand, the irony of the Phaedrus is that we only know about Socrates bemoaning the implications of technology for philosophy because Plato used that technology (brilliantly) to convey his reservations to us. 2400 years ago.  Suck on that, luddites.

"event","The United States Constitution is very difficult for pundits to understand.  On the one hand it is government <i>by</i> the people (majority rule) but on the other hand it is government <i>for</i> the people (limits on government to preserve liberty).  The latter, the counter-majoritarian impulse, confuses <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/13/AR2010011303460.html"">Washington Post columnist George F. Will, in a recent screed questioning whether it is constitutional to require people to get health insurance</a>.  For years Mr. Will and his fellow ""conservatives"" have attacked ""judicial activism"".  Now, however, Mr. Will discovers a ""more truly conservative"" conservatism with <i>favors</i> judicial activism (when it involves striking down a law requiring people to buy health insurance):

<blockquote>More truly conservative conservatives take their bearings from the proposition that government's primary purpose is not to organize the fulfillment of majority preferences but to protect preexisting rights of the individual -- basically, liberty. These conservatives favor judicial activism <i>understood as unflinching performance of the courts' role in that protection.</i></blockquote> (emphasis in the original)

Mr. Will is no more qualified to opine about constitutional law than he is to opine about global warming. Mr. Will begins with a rookie mistake: improper use of the ""slippery slope"".  (He posits an imaginary law requiring everyone to do calisthenics.)  

Learning ""to think like a lawyer"" includes learning how to make the ""slippery slope"" argument properly.  It should not be confused with the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, which is employed to expose absurd, unintended consequences of overly broad laws. ""Slippery slope"" is always a weak argument because it is always immaterial.  It is impertinent by definition: Congress did not, in fact, require everyone to do jumping jacks.  So why did Mr. Will bring this up?  How is this relevant?  On the other hand, ""slippery slope"" can be useful.  It can reveal the underlying basis for some apparently arbitrary distinction (or conversely the lack of any rational basis) but you have to use it properly.  

Consider the difference between the following questions: ""If we allow homosexuals to marry, what is to stop ... ""

GOOD: ""... three or more people from marrying?""
BAD: ""... someone from marrying his box turtle?""

Polygamy is relevent because there are people who desire it, it has a history and there is evidence to show it is a bad thing.  There is no such history or evidence with respect to turtles. Polygamy violates social norms because of the history of abuse and neglect of women and children in these relationships.  Abuse and neglect occur in traditional marriages as well, so, it's not the number of people in the marriage which is the problem, <i>per se</i>, but rather, it's an arbitrary distinction grounded in some evidence, which ultimately can be stated as ""common sense"": a man is more likely to be able to support and care for one family than two or more.  I have no reason to think homosexuals are any more likely to abuse and neglect their partners and children, but ""conservatives"" think of homosexuality as inherently abusive, so this is what they need to prove.  (Right now, in United States District Court, in the ""Prop. 8"" trial in San Francisco.  Bring it on, Alliance Defense Fund, the whole world is watching.)

Clearly, good use of the ""slippery slope""  technique has to be grounded in <i>facts</i> to reveal something or persuade anyone.  To do ""slippery slope"" right, you want to choose a factual scenario which is close to the one you really care about, not a wildly absurd extreme which no one cares about.   

Applying this to health insurance, one might well ask, ""if the government can require us to purchase<i> health</i> insurance, what's to stop them from requiring <i>other</i> kinds of insurance?""  You mean, like car insurance? Or workers compensation insurance?  Oh wait.  

Courts long ago concluded that mandating workers compensation insurance was not only fair, but a more efficient alternative to directly taxing businesses to pay for the public support of workers they have disabled.  It is more efficient because the price of insurance is adjusted based on risk and loss history, so the more dangerous business pay more.  In practice, this is done by having insurance companies present evidence for their different rates, and having a government agency accept or reject the rates, so there's neither a ""free market"" nor a government bureaucracy setting rates, but rather a ""collaboration"" accomplished in our traditional, adversarial mode, with a bunch of lawyers and heated debate on both sides, with plenty of ""liberty"" and due process involved.  

So Mr. Will's argument boils down to nothing more than asserting an interest in tax evasion, which may be a perennially popular ""conservative"" interest, but not a very effective constitutional legal objection."

I drive Ben to his school every morning and we listen to the Stephanie Miller Show, which has the right blend of silliness and seriousness to appeal to both of us.  This morning, Ben asked me why people are so pissed off about more airport security, in particular, the body-scanning machines in which DHS Director Michael Chertikoff has a financial interest.

<lj-cut text=""Read More..."">

I pointed out to Ben that the millions of searches of millions of people since 9/11 had failed to catch a single terrorist, and we didn't catch this underwear bomber on Christmas Day. 

(I glossed over the deterrent effect: there's no doubt in my mind that metal detectors and such have made the job of a would-be hijacker/bomber difficult, and in particular, this guy failed because you can't bring an ordinary commercial explosives detonators on board, making the job of setting off a bomb much, much more difficult).

Trying to explain the difference between police work as it is normally carried out, and airports, I told Ben that although we have a problem with drunk driving in New Mexico, police don't set up roadblocks every morning on I-25 and make <i>everyone</i> take sobriety tests every day.  Instead, the police stop people who are driving suspiciously, and people with a DWI record have to use a sobriety interlock device on their vehicle. In other words, there has to be a some reasonable basis for intrusion in our privacy or inconvenience in our travel.

There followed a brief, ""this is your Dad the Lawyer speaking"", run-down on what the Fourth Amendment requires for searches: at least <i>reasonable suspicion</i> for a warrantless search.  TSA had no reasonable basis to search any of the millions of people who have flown since 9/11.  Yeah sure there are ""exigent circumstances"", but it occured to me that the circumstances could be a lot less ""exigent"".  With more time and resources on ordinary (preventive) police work, airport security could be reduced, for most people.  For example, we had enough tips floating around in our government bureaucracy to justify a ""reasonable suspicion"" warrantless search of underwear bomber, even under my very strict notions of what the Fourth Amendment requires."

"event","Let's stipulate that the first problem with adultery is the lying.  You can do it honestly and get your extramarital affairs preapproved by your wife, but almost no one does, and Tiger didn't. There are other problems, as well, but the breach of trust is the big one.  Magnify it by one million because Tiger Woods is such a celebrity, and that's a major problem.  Not so much a problem that I wouldn't trade places with Tiger if I could, though: if I were offered the choice of being known for cheating, but also being young, handsome and extraordinarily talented at a very lucrative professional sport, I think I'd take the deal.  

Evidently, however, Britt Hume on CNN has no compunctions about giving advice where none is needed.  Hume suggested that Tiger Woods should convert to Christianity, in order to obtain ""forgiveness and redemption"".  Then he dug himself in deeper, <a href=""http://gawker.com/5440096/brit-hume-telling-tiger-woods-to-become-christian-is-not-proselytizing"">by going on O'Reilly and denying that he was proselytzing, but then repeating:</a>  

<blockquote>""He's said to be a Buddhist.  I don't think that faith offers the kind of forgiveness and redemption that is offered by the Christian faith.""</blockquote>

Well, that's true at least.  Buddhists don't need <i>that</i> kind of forgiveness and redemption, the kind that Christianity offers.   Buddhists have their own notions of karma, which don't involve appeasing God.  

Hume, however, also doesn't know much about Christianity.  There's a saying about a mote in your neighbor's eye, and a plank in your own ... but beyond that, confession and repentance occur internally and are strictly a matter between the sinner and God.  Even for Catholics, for whom which Confession is a sacrament and requires an outward manifestation (i.e. you have to say it out loud) you do this in private, not on CNN. So Tiger could very well have done this (in his own way or any of several different Christian ways) and no one would know except God, Tiger, and maybe a priest.  And Hume's a fool if he thinks ""honey, I've found Jesus!"" is the way for Tiger to get his family back. 

Religion aside, and practical personal advice aside, Hume seems to think this would be good public relations for Tiger.  Hume wishes Tiger Woods should make a big show of repentance and thank Jesus ... preferably on Larry King Live?  Hume says would be a ""magnificent"" spectacle and an example to us all.  Hume uses Bill Clinton as an example.  

That really worked well for Clinton, didn't it?"

"event","So to recap, Plato posited three-part human soul.... somewhere he compares to a chariot with two horses and a driver.  Needs and wants are the two horses, and the driver is basic prudence.  Plato also described ""virtues"" or habits of conduct which corresponded to the various drivers:

<b>Temperance</b> moderates the basic human needs: food, shelter, sex and probably also the need for love, friendship and social approval.  

<b>Fortitude</b> regulates our wants and ambitions, and the need to defend ourselves from the ambitions of others.  Plato talks about fortitude as physical courage on the battlefield, but for us, in our desk-sitting world, however, ""fortitude"" is the endurance needed to delay gratification through school and apprenticeship, and bear the indignity of serving clients, customers and managers, facing problems with the appropriate balance between getting to work done and getting the work done right, until we achieve the victory of a vigorous and sustainable solution (and, hopefully, getting paid or promoted). 

<b>Prudence</b> keeps the needs and wants in check with ""common sense"", and anticipates dangers.

<b>Justice</b> in the state or character habit in which all three of the basic virtues are adapted to reality, where the drives to satisfy basic needs are not allowed to ""run wild"", where prudence is not allowed to paralyze with doubt, paranoia or anxiety, and each of the virtues ""mind their own business"" and do what is appropriate for the sake of the whole person in light of the circumstances.

<lj-cut text=""Read More..."">

The imaginary city-state Plato constructs in the <i>Republic</i> is obviously inadequate and could never exist.  Likewise, Plato's assertion of ""just"" habits of living is open to all sorts of objections.  At least one the interlocutors in the dialogue asserts an alternative ethic of excess, relying on strength and power over others to satisfy excessive needs and wants, as the way to the most ""happiness"".   There is also due attention in the dialogue to the fact that, in any group of people, ""appearing"" just, rather than actually ""being"" just, often seems to be the best route to satisying the basic needs of the ego.  

Updating all the talk of battlefield courage to our symbol-manipulating battles, anyone with even casual experience with workplace drama knows that there exist people who demand recognition without deserving it, whose solutions to problems are neither vigorous nor sustainable but get ""sold"" to managers, customers or clients, using all the arts of persuasion and salesmanship and self-promotion which were well known to Plato's readers 2500 years ago.  The technologies of rhetoric (advertising, marketing) may have become more ""sophisticated"" (pun intended: Plato's foes in the ""marketing department"" were called ""Sophists"") but the ethical problems remain the same.  We can add ""social virtues"" to our list, such as honesty, care or respect, and we can even institute education to try and make those virtues habitual.  Above all we need to inculcate a long term perspective in which youthful whining about how the ""rules"" are ""stupid"" is met with warnings about the injustice of force or fraud, but that's about all you can do.  Youth doesn't have the experience to convert a warning into knowledge, and we are all ""youth"" to some extent because our lives are too short to learn everything the hard way.  You can say ""<b>Do not attempt to stop chain with hands or genitals</b>"" all you want, but there will always be people who try.

Socrates' interlocutors include some smart and ethical young men.  They want to believe Socrates, to believe that justice is inherently better than injustice, and that the ""just"" person will be the happy person in the long run, but they <i>despair</i> over the prospect of the ""just"" being deprived of happiness by injustice armed with force or fraud.  To give the ""long run"" argument a bit more length, Socrates posits an immortal soul and tells the Myth of Judgment, wherein unjust conduct is suitably punished.  

Traditionally, this is where philosophy ends and religion begins: with the lies of immortality and Judgment, or a ""leap of faith"" over despair.  Here you can conclude that religion is all lies, or ""a means of social control"" or ""the opiate of the masses"" or ""a dangerous delusional meme"" ... whatever skeptical lens you chose to use, it's all good in my opinion, or good enough for most people and most of the time.

Unfortunately for me, I am not ""most people"".  I foolishly chose the trade of fighting injustice for a living.  Force and fraud are my bread and butter, so to speak.  The despair of Scorates' young men is something very concrete for me, not an abstract problem which arose once in a dorm room discussion but never again.  I have good and practical reasons to dare to penetrate the exoteric manifestations of religion and look for the esoteric, secret mystical insights which continue to drive the whole social phenomenon of religion, hidden away behind the screen of lies, delusions and superstitions. 

<i>To that end...</i>  I found this most mysterious but intriguing passage in Augustine, embedded in one of his tiresome polemics.  Reading Augustine is often tedious because he's arguing with people you have never heard of, for reasons long lost to history.  

In this case, his opponents are the ""Manicheans"".  It should suffice for us to note (1) the Manicheans were one of many groups who tried to blend Hellenic philosophy with Hebrew religion, most of whom, thanks to Augustine, have been cosgined to the dustbin of history as ""heresies"", (2) they employed a dualistic system in which there are two co-equal ""Gods"", one good, the other evil, (3) they identified Yahweh in the Old Testament with the evil god, and Jesus in the New Testament as the representative of the good god, and regarded the Jewish Law as the work of the Devil.  

Finally, it helps to know that Augustine started out as a Manichean but then converted to the ""Catholic"" variety of Christianity and became its most formidable spokesperson ever. The book I am looking at is called ""The Morals of the Catholic Church"", but ""Catholic"" here doesn't mean what we think it means, but rather means ""not Manichean or Gnostic or Arian"", because this is around 400 CE, long before the Great Schism between Latin and Greek Christianity (around 1000 CE) and a thousand years before the Catholic/Protestant divide (around 1500 CE).  <i>All</i> Christian sects surviving today are branches of Augustine's ""Catholic"" church. 

<a href=""http://www.logoslibrary.org/augustine/morals/15.html"">Here's what Augustine had to day about Plato's scheme, ""the cardinal virtues"" of temperance, fortitude, prudence and justice.</a> 

<blockquote>

As to virtue leading us to a happy life, I hold virtue to be nothing else than perfect love of God. For the fourfold division of virtue I regard as taken from four forms of love. For these four virtues (would that all felt their influence in their minds as they have their names in their mouths!), I should have no hesitation in defining them: that temperance is love giving itself entirely to that which is loved; fortitude is love readily bearing all things for the sake of the loved object; justice is love serving only the loved object, and therefore ruling rightly; prudence is love distinguishing with sagacity between what hinders it and what helps it. The object of this love is not anything, but only God, the chief good, the highest wisdom, the perfect harmony. So we may express the definition thus: that temperance is love keeping itself entire and incorrupt for God; fortitude is love bearing everything readily for the sake of God; justice is love serving God only, and therefore ruling well all else, as subject to man; prudence is love making a right distinction between what helps it towards God and what might hinder it.</blockquote>

So, Augustine asserts that love of God perfects all the Greek virtues.  It overcomes despair and takes the place of the Myth of Judgment in Plato's scheme.  Which is all fine and good, but what the heck is it?

If you are like me, both ""love"" and ""God"" here are mysterious undefined terms.  Clearly he can't be talking about ""love"" in any of the ways we ordinarily use the word.  Love of chocolate, love of reading, the love we once had for ex-girlfriends or boyfriends... none of that applies.  Marriage and parenthood come closer: the metaphor Jesus used for the relationship between people and God was nearly always the parent/child relationship  (sometimes it was master/servant, but usually only in strange little parables that obviously require some interpretation to understand).  Later, Christians seized upon the Jewish religious theme of the Messaiah as the ""Son of God"", and talked about the relationship between Jesus and the Church as a ""marriage"", but parenthood, specifically patriarchal parenthood between Father and Child, was the metaphor Christians always liked the most.  This has never been helpful to me.  I can say a lot about my father, both good and bad, but for your purposes I can sum up the bad as follows: ""drunken frat boy who grew up and had a family, but never really grew up"".  The one thing most flawed about my father was the one thing most necessary for a ""Father in Heaven"": someone you can trust.  Who knows?  Maybe Jesus had issues with Joseph and imagined for himself a better father, a Perfect Father... but this was something I could never quite do.

So let's toss that and focus on what Augustine calls God here: ""the chief good, the highest wisdom, the perfect harmony"".  Here again I have problems.  Defining God by superlatives becomes the preferred method in academic, philosophical theology.  Anselm is perhaps the most obnoxious proponent of this method, when he defines God as ""that which nothing greater can be conceived"".  He's taken all the content out of the description and left nothing but the structure: imagine the best thing you can: God is better than that.  I have one word for this approach and that word is: sophomoric.  I can't say my approach is not without its flaws, but it doesn't have the obvious logical flaw of the ""superlatives"" approach (""Can God create a weight he cannot lift?"").  

I want to know who God is and I want to know how love of God is not only possible, but can improve my character in all the ways that Augustine describes in the above-quoted passage.  Only then could Jesus make sense for me, when he says the sum and substance of the Jewish law is: ""Love God, and love your neighbor as yourself.""

This is where I begin talking about God as an imaginary friend who represents all knowledge.  I can anticipate objections.  One good one is the positivist objection that ""<i>ought</i> cannot be derived from <i>is</i>"".  If you think of ""knowledge"" as a matter of language: statements, propositions, perhaps based on empirical knowledge, then this seems a very good objection indeed.  I reply that this isn't logical derivation from a small set of experiments or experiences, however rigorously contrived, but a massive brute force experiment on an almost unimaginable scale: evolution and natural selection, capped with 100,000 years of cultural experience as a social animal.  Genetics and culture don't always express themselves in language and logic: language is but one example of culture.  Moreover, there comes a point where the mere ""quantity"" of data becomes a ""quality"" in itself, a quality which is lost by the logical method of taking complex problems and reducing them to simple components.  When philosophers and theologians use the ""superlatives"" method of defining God (or proving that God ""exists"") this is the direction they are pointing in, this is the perspective they want us to have: really, really big.  (But a whole lot of nothing is still nothing.  You need to start with something substantial before you start magnifying it.)

I think we have learned more from our failures than from our successes.  In the course of Earth's history, sometimes Life's experiments have catastrophic effects. Progress in one area can result in disaster in others. An example which intrigues me is the Late Devonian mass extinction which ushers in the Carboniferous Age.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Devonian_extinction#Plant_evolution"">One theory for the cause of this extinction event is plant evolution</a>: plants developed vascular systems which allowed their stems to grow tall, spread branches, and send roots deep into the soil.  This allowed the ""greening"" of the land masses, the spread of plants across the continents.  This in turn may have caused a transition from ""Greenhouse Earth"" to ""Icehouse Earth"" as the plants removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and stored in in the ground in the form of decaying plant matter, and also ""anoxic"" conditions in coastal areas (roots released massive amounts of plant nutrients, this causes marine plant blooms which reduces the amount of oxygen in the seas).  Either lower sea levesl or anoxic conditions, or both, decimated marined life, particularly in tropic reefs.  It took millions of years for reef-building marine life to reassert itself.  Thus, ""progress"" in one area (for plants) may be an ""evil"" for other life forms, in the short run at least.  The ""knowledge"" we are talking about here is an interdependent and highly conditional system.  

Perhaps more significant from a theological point of view, however: (1) knowledge must be enacted by some agent to produce any change or result in the world, and (2) the knowledge system I am describing is finite and progressive.  My definition therefore requires me to abandon the notion of an all-powerful God who can perform sudden miracles which defy the laws of nature or necessity, or who can do anything without our agency.   We are God's servants.  ""God helps them who help themselves"".   Can God create a weight He cannot lift?  No.  Does God have knowledge which as yet does not exist (possible future knowledge)?  No.  God is finite, but big enough to be practically infinite to you, the individual.  

This may come as a shock to people who for whom religious and spiritual life consists almost entirely of wishful thinking, praying to God for miracles, but the truth is, I not only willing but eager to eject such people from my system.  Belief in an anthropomorphic warlord diety who has to be appeased by various sacrifices (or obedience to whimsical ""laws"") in order to perform miraculous favors for your tribe is childish, superstitious and idolatrous. In the story of life on Earth, your tribe's peculiar concerns of the moment are as nothing, and no sacrifice you can make is going to alter that.

It comes down to this: love of God should be easy to understand (if not so easy to put into practice) if, as some say, ""self-love"" is ubiquitous and all-powerful, <i>provided</i> you have a sufficiently huge notion of ""self"".  Clearly that's what Jesus assumed when he said: ""love they neighbor <i>as thyself</i>.""  Loving God extends this to loving all life, present and past, for what it has attempted and continues to attempt.  The story of life on earth has yet to be told completely, but it is enough to inspire faith, hope and love."

"event","As I contemplate the complete repudiation of politically-correct toys in my household this year (the boys are running around with variety of Nerf armaments, ranging from swords to machine pistols to a fully automatic ""Vulcan"" machine gun which, aside from its garish colors and sponge ammo, looks like something a Hollywood action hero might heft, complete with ammo belt and large carrying handle) my thoughts turn to writing a rationalist's glossary of common religious terms.  

One of the biggest impediments to rational discussion of religion is the tendency of believers to speak in a self-referential and tautological ""code"" of religious terms.  It's one thing to say that, ultimately, religion involves things which are articles of ""faith"".  It's quite another to quite another to digsuise a lot of pseudo-religious opinion-mongering and unabashed speculation in a thick haze of vague words which mean one thing to the speaker and quite another to just about everyone else.  To take my favorite extreme example, ""God hates fags"": maybe your ""God"" does Mr. Phelps, but I don't think anyone else's does.  Even his political allies on the issue of ""fags"" are quick to correct him: ""God"" hates the ""sin"", not the ""sinner"".

I'm a ""believer"" in the limited sense that I think the Christian message, the ""Gospel"", is by the far the most appropriate way of life and political attitude, with or without all the theological and cultural baggage that has attached itself to the Gospel.  I subscribe to the Christian table of virtues (""faith"", ""hope"" and ""charity"") above any personal ethic of self-aggrandizement (making virtues of strength, power, or wealth) or even virtues with some social utility, such as valor, honor, diligence or honesty.

Clearly, though, if I am to discuss this with anyone outside the extremely limited circle of people who are not only Christian but <i>my</i> kind of Christian (basically, educated liberal Christians) I will need to define all these terms (Gospel, faith, hope, charity, prayer, love and of course, God) divergently instead of convergently.  While it makes perfect, concise sense to me to say ""faith is trust in God"" referring back to God in the definition raises more questions than it answers, even for people with their own working definitions and cultural referents for ""God"", let alone people who have no idea what that word really means.

So, to begin: ""God""

<lj-cut text=""Read More..."">

Lucky for us there has been a lot of real science directed toward religion in the past twenty years.  Not just the spinning of hypotheses, either, but the beginnings of proper tests for those hypotheses, with ethnographical fieldwork, archeology, evolutionary psychology and a whole host of scientific disciplines.  One hypothesis for an innate cognitive preference or faculty for religious belief is the ""hyperactive"" or ""hypersensitive"" agency detection device (HADD), a model which comes out of the field of ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science_of_religion"">Cognitive science of religion</a>""

Events in our environment, such as a ripple in the tall grass, may be random events caused by natural forces such as the wind, or they may be evidence of an ""agent"", an animal hiding in the grass such as a lion.  There would be a clear adaptive advantage to presume that the event was caused by an <i>agent</i> (predator, prey, another human) at least until heightened attention reveals no further evidence of such an agent.  The fact that HADD is ""unreliable"" or frequently wrong (it's just the wind) is a small price to play for not being eaten by a lion or killed by an enemy or missing dinner.  It is a ""wasteful"" and inefficient investment of imagination, but worth the cost in the long run.  

(Jumping ahead a bit: ""waste"" becomes a theme in religion, and especially Christianity.  Waste and inefficiency seem to be the way religion works, compared with alternatives, and assuming you have an alternative.  For example: ""love your enemies"" seems to be a rather inefficient approach, if you instead have the opportunity to completely annihilate them.  More often than not, however, complete annilhilation is neither possible nor desirable, and you are stuck with on-going antagonism or cooperation.)

This is interesting so far as it goes, and explains the beginnings of animism and beliefs in nature spirits and so forth, but religion does far more than attribute ""agency"" to an event.  It gives the agent a name, and a geneogology and family history.  It projects intentions, purposes and consciousness to the agent.  For example, a person sees lightning and calls the agent ""Thor"" (or ""Zeus"" or pick your favorite) and tells stories about why Thor hurled the lightning bolt and what Thor wants.  To explain the <i>content</i> of HADD-initiated agency stories, I would add ancestor worship or veneration, and ponder the significance of very ancient and universal burial practices.  It is a very small step, semantically, from saying ""I remember the advice Elder Gak gave me ten years ago, before he died..."" to saying ""the spirit of Elder Gak appeared to me and said...."".   The need for this sort of thing is obvious when we consider what people learn over the course of their lives and the experience lost when people die.  There is an adaptive advantage to preserving, accumulating and transmitting life experiences: no need to ""re-invent the wheel"", so to speak.  

We can develop technologies (writing) and social institutions (universities) and try to do this in some rigorous manner, but even after large scale social organization makes things like that possible, it remains desirable to give experience a bit of vibrancy and power as an intellectual meme.  One way to do this is to attribute an idea or saying to a peculiarly influential ancestor.  The Illiad and the Odyssey were likely the result of an oral tradition spanning generations, but it was easier to attribute authorship to a well-known poet who was involved in the process (Homer).  Likewise, the first five books of the Scriptures are attributed to ""Moses"", and even today people attribute all sorts of clever sayings to Abraham Lincoln, which upon rsearch turn out to have originated with other, more obscure personages.  Over time, the distinction between attributing a mathematical theorem to a group (""the Pythagoreans"") or one increasingly legendary and mythic personage (""Pythagoros"") loses any real signifiance, and for everyone who is not a pedant, it may be sufficient to simply say ""the Greeks"".  Conversely, there may be social and political advantages to taking the laws of a Babylonian king (Hammurabi) and attributing them to a Hebrew hero (Moses).

Of course. the accumulation of ""experience"" can also become the accumulation of error.  We can apply experience inappropriately, or hold onto ""laws"" long after they have become outmoded, and ""authority"" can give a weak opinion more value than it deserves.  It is, though, in a way, a self-correcting mechanism.  In the process of apotheosis, the elevation of an ancestor to demi-god to montheistic ""God"" or perhaps even a free-floating agentless body of ""enlightenment"", the fictitious agent must be come more complex, and incorporate more diverse experience and opinions.  All the major world religions are frightfully complex.  If you can say, ""I know what God wants here"" or ""I know precisely how to follow the eightfold path to enlightenment in this situation"" then I daresay you weren't really paying attention in your religious education.  Only simpletons can ask ""What Would Jesus Do?"" and expect to get clear, positive directions.

We see this all the time in contemporary politics in the United States, where the assertion of allegedly ""Christian"" values such as aversion to homosexuality can be readily, obviously and directly countered by the words of Jesus himself, who preached above all ""love thy neighbor"" and frequently counseled tolerance for the ""sins"" of others.  Indeed, there's no claim by radical rightwing ""Christians"" that can't be refuted by reciting Jesus chapter and verse, and that's not because Jesus was invariably a ""liberal"" in the modern sense.  (I don't think modern liberals could enthusiastically embrace Jesus' hard-core views against divorce, for example).  Rather, it's because the reported sayings of Jesus already represented a diverse and rich religious tradition at the time they were first written down, and the passage of two thousand years has not made understanding their words any easier.

It seems to me ridiculous to object that falsifying the experience by attributing it to a fictional agent (say, Thor) impedes proper scientific investigation of natural phenomenon (say, lightning).  Science will inevitably progress when the foundations for invetigaiton are laid: in the case of lightning, when the notions of static electricity and positive and negative charge are introduced and developed.  I would even go so far as to downplay the social danger of misattributing intention to the fictitious entity, at least over the long term.  A religious authority might say:  ""Thor hurled that lightning bolt because he disapproves of your dishonorable behavior!""  Persons who do that sort of thing are going to make such judgments and pronounce them one way or another, and it hardly addresses the moral suasion or political power of the religious leader to say, ""no, lightning is the discharge of electrical potention when the clouds have one charge and the ground has another!""  One does better to directly attack the influence of the leader, perhaps by recalling previous instances of self-interested predictions or evidence of bribe-taking, rather than confusing everyone with a distracting assault on religious fictions.  The fact that ""Christian"" televangelists put words in Jesus' mouth to serve their own political or financial agenda is a lot less damning to me than specific evidence that Jim Bakker pocketed money intended for Bibles to Africa, and even the ones who have never been caught with their hands in the till (say, Pat Robertson) live pretty high on the hog.  And if there is no such evidence of corruption, perhaps the leaders pronouncements are worthy of deference despite his or her unscientific manner of expression.

In short, an unexamined pose of skepticism towards fictional agents seems to me just as lazy, ignorant and stupid as unexamined belief: neither takes on the work of investigating, analyzing and prioritzing claims.  I begin with the hypothesis that God is an imaginary friend, representing all experience accumulated over the course of life on Earth, with narrowing factors such as the experience of humans, the experience of my particular culture, nation or community, and so forth.  In this view ""Science"" is not opposed to ""faith"", Science is one of the many attributes of God."

"event","Is Jesus ""the Reason for the Season""? Nonsense. The reason for the season is the earth's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"">axial tilt.</a>  At latitudes closer the the poles, this causes the pattern of seasonal weather variation and the shortening and lengthening of days on a yearly cycle.  With the advent of agriculture this pattern was observed with some precision, and since Neolithic times it has been celebrated and mythologized.  Wine and beer produced following the harvest had time to ferment and become drinkable, cattle were slaughtered to reduce the amount of feed necessary during the winter months, and especially at extreme northern latitudes, a festival atmosphere could help combat the depressive symptoms of seasonal affective disorder.  

The utility and popularity of these celebrations has allowed them to survive despite Christian efforts to suppress them or appropriate them.

<lj-cut text=""Read More..."">

Early Christians did not celebrate the birth of Jesus.  Origen even attacks birthday celebrations as the narcissitic preoccupation of earthly rulers, such as Pharaoh and the Roman puppet Herod.   For the first Christians, the most important events in the life of Jesus were his death and resurrection, celebrated at Easter.  Early (200-300 CE) Christian calendars varied, noting either the nativity or the conception at the spring equinox (thus implying a December birth) but nothing at the winter solstice.  The death of Jesus is the center of Christian faith and is described in detail in all four Gospels and the Epistles, but his birth is mentioned in only two Gospels.  Only Luke and Matthew make any effort to mythologize the birth of Jesus.  Luke, writing for a Hellenic audience, has Joseph and Mary travel to Bethlehem from their home in Nazareth.  Matthew, writing for Jews, simply has him born in Bethlehem and incorporates themes from the life of Moses (Pharoah killing the first-born) and Messianic prophecies (the appearance of magi from the East).  Matthew clearly isn't relating ""facts"" but putting Jesus in a mythological context, and in any event, the compilers of the Scriptural canon didn't care enough about the issue to bother to reconcile the divergent accounts.

Efforts to appropriate Roman winter solstice celebrations and give them a Christian religious significance commenced in the Byzantine (Eastern) Roman Empire in the late 4th Century, along with other efforts to establish to impose an official, imperial ""Catholic"" Christianity based in Rome.  The celebration of Saturnalia was the Roman version of a Greek holiday celebrating Zeus' victory over his father (the old god Chronos, or Saturn for the Romans) which constituted a revolution among the gods to establish a new Olympic partriarchy.  Saturnalia had ""role-reversal"" features where masters made a show of serving their slaves, along with a permissive attitude toward drunken revelry and sexual promiscuity.  For centuries thereafter, Christians attacked the moral depravity and excess of Christmas merry-making as ""paganism"" (a political epithet roughly equivalent to charges of ""Communism"" today) but the ""role reversal"" feature of Saturnalia persisted in the Middle Ages with landlords presenting gifts to their tenants around Christmas time (reversing the usual feudal obligation of the tenant farmer to support the warrior landlord).  

Up through the Middle Ages the the emphasis was on a ""season"" or period of days (Advent or ""the twelve days of Christmas"") rather than a particular day.  Marking December 25 as a particularly important day began after Charlemagne was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day in 800.  Protestants were divided on the significance of Christmas.  Luther loved Christmas and gave sentimental sermons about the Baby Jesus, backed by a renewed interest in the theological significance of the Incarnation of God as Man.  Kill-joy iconoclast Calvinists, on the other hand, who had a tendency to vandalize religious art which they believed misrepresented the Scriptures, continued the tradition of debunking Christmas as a pagan celebration.   

The final Anglo-American synthesis of the religious holiday with the German ""Yule"" celebrations (evergreens, fires and candles, Santa Claus, gift-giving) didn't happen until the 19th Century.  Christmas trees became popular with the importation of the German Hannover clan (the Georges and Victoria) to rule the United Kingdom.  Still, for two thousand years, and especially after the Reformation, serious-minded Christian leaders were well aware of the pre-Christian origins of the popular seasonal celebrations and preached and agitated against them.  Jesus was not ""the reason for the season"" but quite the contrary, the reason for saying, ""bah, humbug"".  

Then in 1843, Charles Dickens published <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, overwhelming radical Protestant opposition to the ""pagan"" or ""popish"" trappings of ancient winter solstice celebrations with a massive blast of schmaltz, sentimentality and nostalgia, and an ingenious appropriation of the ancient myth of annual role-reversal to preach a socialist message of compassion for the poor.  It is about this time that many popular Christmas carols were published and started infiltrating church services, and merchants began to see the economic utility of promoting gift-giving.

As Hegel noted in his introduction to the <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, in a master-servant relationship it is the servant who gains knowledge and understanding of the material world by being compelled to work with it, whereas the master has a tendency to become alienated from reality.  From master and slave, feudal lord and tenant, Victorian banker and clerk, right down to Mr. Potter (capitalist pig) and George Bailey (socialist vanguard) in Frank Capra's <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>, Christmas has been the time in which we assert the necessity of compassion, community and yes, wasteful and conspicuous consumption, against oppression imposed without recognition of the suffering and sadness which can accompany winter in these northerly climes.  It is in this context that we revive the fabrications of Luke and tell a story of a poor couple traveling to Bethlehem who can find no room at the inn, and thus are compelled to bring the Messiah, God himself, into the world in a stable, attended only by a some shepards and a trio of illuminated foreigners who have followed the signs in the heavens and acknowledge the baby as king and priest, and prophesize his death as suffering Savior of the world, with gold, frankincense and myrhh."

"event","Health insurance is about to become a tightly regulated form of insurance, and this is a very good thing, with or without any kind of ""public option"".

Allow me to illustrate by ""length of policy"".  The length and number of exclusions and exceptions in an insurance contract reflects what the insurer thinks they can get away with.   The more claims they can get away with not paying, the more exclusions and exceptions they stick in the policy.  The shortest policies are issued in regulated types of insurance, and the shortest of all are in <i>mandatory</i> regulated insurance (workers compensation and motor vehicle insurance).  Car insurance tends to be short: 12-20 pages depending on how they format it.  Business liability insurance issued by an authorized, regulated insurer, by contrast, runs 50-100 pages (which actually makes sense because it covers a lot more situations).  Business liability insurance issued by unauthorized, unregulated (""surplus lines"") insurers on the other hand, tends to run to book length: 500 pages of exceptions and conditions and exclusions.  That's the type of insurance you get if you operate a high-risk business (selling alcoholic beverages, for example) which typically no insurance company authorized to do business in your State will cover.  

A typical health insurance policy, on the other hand, is like an entire library.  Health insurance contracts negotiated by business, institutions and unions can't be bound under a single cover, but typically fill an entire shelf of binders.  You, the consumer, typically never see these, you get an ""explanation"" or ""summary"" (which by itself can be monstrous).  All of that is going to be history soon.

Now, of course, even motor vehicle insurers will try to cheat you.  But they typically do it through claims adjusting (low-balling the amount of damages) and not by denying coverage. They can't pull tricks that are common in health insurance.  They can't (legally) say: ""you failed to disclose a pre-existing crack in your windshield therefore we aren't paying for your windshield"".  If they did that, and you sued, a judge would say ""I don't care what your policy says: this is mandatory insurance and all property damage from a collision is covered.""  They can't require complicated and burdensome loss notice paperwork: you failed to present your card, and your doctor failed to fill out form X83/B, and you both failed to stand on your head and recite the Pledge of Allegience, therefore your dialysis isn't covered.  Another advantage to this is that once health care providers are relieved of a lot of burdensome and non-uniform claims paperwork, it will be a lot easier to catch the ones who engage in fraud.  Instead of ""is this procedure on our list?"" the question becomes ""did you actually perform this procedure?"" which is a much more important question for reducing costs.

The same goes for tricks like areas of coverage and provider networks and so forth.  The only allowable exception in auto insurance I am aware of is driving in Mexico: they are allowed to exclude that.  They can't refuse to pay because you went to your favorite body shop instead of their approved shop.  They can't exclude driving at night, or in the rain, or crossing State lines.  They can't exclude drunk driving.  I can't think of another area of contract law where you can engage in risky, illegal conduct and still enforce the contract... but you can with mandatory ""no fault"" insurance.

(Incidently, my experience litigating motor vehicle coverage also makes doubt whether competition from a ""public option"" will really ""keep insurers honest"".  The motor vehicle insurance industry is fiercely competitive, more so than any government-run insurance would ever be, and yet companies like Allstate still exist.  Allstate is notorious among lawyers for having the most evil and dishonest claims practices in the industry).  

Granted, the State and federal regulations which will take the place of privately negotiated contracts will be long.  But they will not be written to deliberately deny benefits.  As mandatory insurance, they will be interpreted in a court of law to give you the coverage which you paid for and which ""public policy"" now demands.  Not only will some claims-denial tricks like ""rescission"" for ""misrepresentation"" be specifically outlawed, but many tricks not covered or anticipated in the current legislation will fail in court.  Why?  Because when you make insurance <i>mandatory</i>, it ceases being a private contract covered exclusively by the written policy and presumably negotiated in good faith by two parties with equal bargaining power, but becomes a matter of ""public policy"".  ""Public policy"" in plain English means a reason for judges to write you coverage <i>even if it isn't spelled out in your contract</i>, and even if the written contract says ""No"", a judge can say ""Yes"".

I wonder if health insurance companies are ready for this.  I'd bet that in company legal departments all over the country, lawyers are getting extremely frustrated trying to warn management that things are gonna change.  What may happen is something similar to what happened in the mortgage-lending business: lots of people could foresee massive default and foreclosure problems looming, but companies like Countrywide just kept plugging away until they were destroyed, bankrupt, or purchased by another lender."

In the meantime, I noted that Canadians are concerned about the seizure of Watt's laptop and ""t<a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canadians-dont-forfeit-right-to-privacy-at-border-obama-official-says/article1399119/"">he potential for intrusion has raised concerns from American legislators and groups like defence lawyers, who fear solicitor-client privilege could be violated.</a>""  Police now routinely seize computers even as, in this case, there is zero chance that any  evidence relevant to the ""crime"" of being assaulted by a Customs agent will be found on Mr. Watt's laptop.  

But, um, that's ""defense"" and ""lawyer"", not ""defence"" and ""solicitor"".  Please correct your spelling, Canada!  KTHXBYE"

"event","<a href=""http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/did-you-ask-nicely-by-digby-so-theyre.html"">US border patrol roughed up a Canadian writer</a> who was attempting to cross the border to drive home.  No details as to why the border cops engaged in this behavior (excessive force, confiscation of property, and then abandonment) but there can be no legal justification for it. None. 

I'm particularly concerned about the abandonment.  In my view, when the police arrest someone, take someone's liberty away (and his car, and communications devices and in this case even his clothing) I believe they become legally responsible for what happens to them.  In this case, not much happened, but I know of at least one case where a mentally ill man wandered off into the desert and died of hypothermia.  This is a difficult legal issue, though.  Holding people accountable for their stupidity is never easy.

The one thing I disagree with digby about: this sort of thing hasn't ""escalated"" recently.  Police misconduct in the United States has always been a problem, for some people more than others.  Indeed, I've been contemplating a few posts on why I've made police misconduct the focus of my law practice.  First because it's a bad thing worth fighting, but also because it seems so deeeply ingrained in our society that I'm pretty sure I can spend the rest of my career doing these cases, and making a lot of money.  A growth industry, as it were."

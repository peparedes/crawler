"event","<p align=""center"">Alright so listen up fans, celerity is on the verge of getting axed due to lack of response.<br /><br />Here's the deal, no comment/no substance which = crap show, therefore if we have no topics or guests celerity cannot continue.<br /><br />Woah i hear you all cry, I can sense the urgency in this - so get thinking about what you want to hear, or who you want to hear &amp; let us know!! </p>"

"event","<p align=""center"">Okay so Vet first of all.. did I give you authorization to write a post? NO! My 12:30 am post suffices. (don't correct me on that). Okay so mainly we talked about Selo &amp; Josh, so Ali, Erin, everyone else where are your comments?!!? P.S Josh I can imagine you having a heart attack, but we're workng on the cable! 

So indeed tonight was our second podcast &amp; I of course did all the organising as I always do, &amp; took it upon myself to take photos in the studio itself (aka my room).</p><center>

"event","<p align=""center""><font size=""7"">okay so listen up!!!!!<br /><font size=""2"">Jono &amp; Nic might POSSIBLY be doing the podcast tonight. This means that we don't have much to work with seeing as no one except selo (&amp; possibly josh, i'll take as anon) has commented. So far these are the questions/comments/shoutouts being asked to them if it was to air tonight:<br /><br />1) Why is Jono so inferior to Selo?<br />2) Shout out to Selo<br />3) Pumba vs Selo in a fight.<br /><br />1) Why is Selo so inferior to Josh?<br />2) Shout out to Josh<br />3) Selo vs Josh in a fight (feat. cable-o-nine-tails) <strong>- someone care to elaborate on cable-o-nine-tails?<br /><br /></strong>&amp; that's all. So if you want to hear a good show, PUT IN A GOOD COMMENT! Remember we include every comment in the podcast so what are you waiting for??? GO GO GO hurry I'm doing the rundown soon.<br /><br /><strong>EDIT: I am putting in a new segment called '20 in 60'. What it is, is basically a segment for our guests, where we ask 20 questions in 60 seconds&nbsp;&amp; if you can answer them all you get a chocolate (or other prize). So I need 20 questions for Jono &amp; 20 for Nic.. they don't have to be long just short ones, similar but hopefully less lamer than the ones we usually hear at Switch. Go go go we need Q's!</strong></font></font></p>"

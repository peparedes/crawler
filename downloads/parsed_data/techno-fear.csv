Not as much as before, Im much better at controlling it - and I do know I can quit so when Im off the diet I can stop again and put all the weight back on. (** sings theme from The Magic Roundabout in head **)

Cat and snake are fine - havent handled Vasquez in over a year and I think it may now be too late. I hate stressing her out and even as a baby snake she got stressed. I know she would get used to it but its the getting there..

Boyfriend made redundant - stupid factory - so hes jobsearching. It aint easy when you have no qualifications to speak of and theres hundreds of other people looking for work. At least hes back home with mummy and daddy so they can keep him as the government are taking their sweet time to pay out redundancy money and jobseekers allowance.

I was shocked and appalled when I saw the video of that man being sent flying by a copper at G20. Of course their defence will be what he was doing before the recording. Most likely nothing, the coppers had a bad day and werent in the mood to be gentle. At least the copper responsible came forward...

I can acknowledge the fact Im eating too much to compensate and Im beginning to get a hold on it now.. Just hoping I dont start drinking now...

Easier to quit in summer I think - its hot anyway. Dont need another hot thing in your face...

Really want a holiday. But no money and no leave left... oh well.

"event","So fed up with this - Im not well again. This appears to be a chest infection again, just a much nicer one than Ive ever had before. No chest pain, no painful coughing or bringing up blood... so all-in-all nice. A bit of coughing, total breathlessness but otherwise ok.

HOWEVER I have been on antibiotics for three days and there has been no change... which makes me think this aint normal. There is now a horrid thought going through my head that this could be the onset of COPD... Chronic Obstructive Pulminary Disease... which is the only thing I was really scared of as a smoker. Heart disease and strokes never scared me - being constantly plumbed into oxygen however - did.

Im sure Im just overreacting and this is just an infection. I bloody well hope so."

"event","Thats how long its been since I updated this thing. Boring stuff first - work same as always, everyones miserable and fed up with being treated like children but whats new? Well - there is a rumour we will all be going back to our boroughs... unable to confirm yet, except to say Croydon turned their cad room into a locker room and have recently moved the lockers out and repainted... hmmmm...

Flats still perfect, have big plans for renovation and shelves... Ripley slightly weirded out by sudden presence of man, Vasquez couldnt be any more obvious if she had blueprints and a large shovel, that snake has some serious escape plans...

To the big news of course, the sudden arrival of man on my planet. Been seeing him since July last year - attempted the friends thing several times as he was living with someone slim and blonde. Didnt last. Cut him off about three times - refused his calls ignored his texts (cant say I didnt try!) but unfortunately when its meant to be it will find a way of happening. Kind of obvious when on our second ""date"" we didnt shut the hell up for eight hours...

Stupid arse may have impregnated his ex-girlfriend as she informed him a week before he was going to leave. They hadnt talked in months, were practically seperate entities sharing the same space, were not ""trying"" for a baby at all, but of course whats the best way to trap a man? Unfortunately her plan didnt work cos he left anyway. She were not happy.

Obviously my name is mud, but they are talking and getting on ok - she even helped him move his stuff. I reckon if she is making it up then we will hear the old favourite ""I lost it"" in the next few weeks. Her ""doctor"" has told her its due end of November. If she was 8 weeks in February - what is she? An elephant? Im afraid the maths just dont work. If Im wrong - then I will be taking her to lunch in a year. Shes shown how reasonable she can be and I am, after all, me.

A child is not a good reason for two people to stay together - its a terrible burden for a child to act as glue holding something together thats broken...

So - getting through that was tough, but were still here. Hes moved in (AAAAAAH! HOW DID THAT HAPPEN???) and so have his 600 CD's. His names Chris, works in a factory (for now), plays the drums, wears gold hoop earrings (I got the gold necklace, working on the rest), knows everything there is to know about music and comic books, and for some reason which I still havent figured out - he loves me.

Im afraid Ive reached the age where other peoples opinions mean less than nothing to me, they can say what they think about his/our actions I just couldnt give a shit. Im not giving up on this one, turns out Im stronger than even I thought. So thats it - the latest from Erith brought to you direct."

We had an 85 year old man with terminal illness and depression hurl himself off the 3rd floor of the M&S car park a few weeks back. I saw him plummet on the cameras but didnt see him land.

Calling solicitor on average once a week - if he keeps bleating about how the delay is not his fault, how am I supposed to threaten to severely beat him? Bloody solicitors... Anyway hes waiting for a few more questions to be answered then we can exchange. FINALLY. I knew there was a reason I kept all my male friends around- theyre all offering to help me move. And me being me Im refusing to let them. Except one who owes me big time.

New job in Lambeth isnt nearly as bad as everyone made out - but then Im not answering phones. We are so desperate for staff Im constantly despatching. Hurrah and huzzah. Since we moved Ive done Greenwich, Bexley, Bromley, Peckham, Brixton and Kennington. All of which are great fun! Havent done Croydon or Lewisham yet. I was referred to Occupational Health for my stress levels. Got there - told her about PCOS (of which she had no idea) - she said its obviously not affecting my health/work and sent me away. What a waste of an afternoon - but I did get to see Limehouse Police station.

Mummys pretty much been given the all clear - has to have three weeks of radiotherapy (which shes dreading) which will make her tired and irritable. Plus travel up to KCH every day. But on the half-full side, after its finished she can start looking at properties in Zomerzet.

Bee may be back in November - her company are apparently making EVERYONE redundant - which would mean as she is shy of the five years she needs - she would be deported. She doesnt really care any more anyway as her cat Lilly (and pretty much her only companion) got knocked down by a car and killed a month ago.

I have discovered the way to put house-buying/moving fears to the back of my mind is to seduce yet another married policeman.

She is only a size 16 however, and has spiky blonde hair. Yuk.

Anyway - she moves home in April - and when I offered to help out (load me up like a packhorse) she was very grateful and suggested I act as traffic warden to the 10-12 policemen who are helping her move.

Is it me? I would never ask colleagues to take time out of their day to help me move all my crap. I asked ONCE and never again. I asked Edward to help me move my new fridge from my car into my garage. He called me later ON HIS WAY HOME. So I couldnt ask him to come back. That was that. Ive always been iffy about it - and he put a seal on me ever asking for help again.

Obviously Ali does not agree with being so fiercely independant - and will happily ask for help as the ""weak little girly"".. Hmmm. I have moved three times, around Yorkshire, and with the exception of Lynn unwrapping cutlery and occasionally moving a book - I have done it by myself. I wasnt expecting much from her as I had seen her attempts to chop wood. Mother got it into her head I would get some paramedics to help. Errr - NO!

Had a lovely weekend in his farmhouse in Forest Row - after which - he dumped me. Hmmmm. I dont want to blow my own trumpet here - but I KNOW it was nothing I did.

"event","Two things this week that have REALLY pissed me off....
<lj-cut>

1. Scenario...
My friend Lynn who works at a certain large hospital - got into a heated discussion with an appointments nurse (male) who said to her ""This is why you're single..."" She was going to reply but decided it wouldnt add to the argument - and she could tell he was ""joking"". I have several problems with this...

My Manager as some of you may remember said something very similar to me when I commented that a woman being slapped in the street by her husband should fucking well slap him back. His comment was ""Thats why you're not married."" Thats right Ian! Im not married because I wont put up with domestic violence! My colleague Julie was beaten by her husband, shes now dead, let me go out and find him - all my troubles will be over!

Point being - 60-70 years ago (as mother pointed out) no-one would question why a woman was single incase her husband/fiance/boyfriend died in the war. Whos fucking business is it anyway? Would you go up to a divorced woman and say ""Thats why your husband left you..""?? Or to a widow and say ""Thats why your husband died...""??? NO. NOT A FUCKING CHANCE JOKING OR NOT.

My point is - that is a personal comment about someones personal life. How dare these fucking men think they can comment on single girls personal lives because there isnt a man around to object??? Fuck them..

2. Scenario...
A few years back I went to a wedding reception in East London. It finished late (as they often do) and I travelled with two male companions to Leicester Square to get a night bus. After 2am - both their night buses has been and gone, with them on. I was standing, age 22, in the middle of London, at 2am on a Friday night. On my own. When I told my friend Emily this three days ago - she replied she would never speak to them again.

Two days later - we have our Christmas do. Caligulettes in Bromley, I say ""we"" I mean me and four sets of couples. Deep joy. Anyway - after meal, around half midnight, we all make our way home. Two sets are walking, two sets are driving, and Ive got to get a cab. Three sets all leave, one couple (at the girls insistence) walk me to the cab office. I didnt ask - but then I never would. They are walking to Widmore Road when Im done - but a friend of theirs pulls up to see if they want a lift. To Widmore Rd - from Bromley North. For those of you who know Bromley - you can see where Im going.

Because male companion starts hopping on each foot, complaining of cold and would have said if his thoughts were made vocal ""For fucks sake, lets go, she'll be alright look at the size of her..."" I told them to go and get in their friends car. If my thoughts were made vocal they would have been ""Raz - get that hopping fucksplat out of my sight now..""

At MY insistence - they go with their friend (approx 100yds to home) and I am standing outside East St cabs with five drunk males. I only have to wait another half hour before my cab shows - so I didnt do too badly.

So I wouldnt ask - that automatically means anything that happens to me is my fault right? Well Emily says no, it shouldnt even be a question. Im female I should get escorted. But said I - Emily you've never been alone. Youve always had a man there to escort you. Plus I realise theres a B I G difference in mine and Emilys size - but then surely we would stand the same chance up against a big man with a bigger knife???

It only occurred to me that night - that no man of my acquaintance has ever had a problem leaving me standing anywhere at any time surrounded by anyone at risk of anything. But if anything were to happen to me not only would it be a HUGE suprise - but also it would be my fault."

My good friend couldnt come because her mother passed away, Im not allowed to wear jeans and comfy footwear anymore apparently so I was in a skirt and my new knee-length boots which KILL, had my new jumper which I didnt realise made me look so HUGE till I got to the venue, meal was tiddly, could not get drunk no matter how hard I tried, operator from another team coming on to anything with a penis and really winding me up, copper who I would call a mate tells me Im a miserable bitch, everyone around me drunk, got dragged up for one dance and then couldnt move the rest of the night, however perfect make-up.

I am now wearing what I want to do's, I couldnt give a toss what people think I should wear. Better that Im up being sociable than unable to move due to footwear."

"event","The most hated, arrogant, egotistical pigfucker of a copper has gone...

<lj-cut>

My own beloved huge barrel of fetted monkey spunk has left... to go to Kentpol no less... heh heh heh ENJOY MOFO! This man has been rude over the air numerous times, says he doesnt want something then complains when its not done, belittles and degrades control staff and I am SO FUCKING PLEASED TO SEE THE BACK OF HIS GIGANTIC WHITE MUSHY BUTT! Luckily I wasnt drunk enough at any stage to tell him so.

On more of an upside, got to see lots of nice coppers I havent seen in a while, got to sing some karaoke and unfortunately got up to some naughties.

As usual starts in the Spoons in Bromley, cheap drinks. As far as I knew my married policeman (who is - one can assume - BLIND) was working till midnight. Imagine my suprise when he shows up at 6pm. The team en-masse decide 7pm is curry time. I am forced to accompany them (even tho I hate curry) all the way up the High St. I discover I like chicken tikka and theres a pickle thing in a bowl that looks (and tastes) like Satans diorreah. Anyway - much a-drinking followed, and wouldnt you know it? Right next door is a karaoke bar.

Now I want to make it perfectly clear I will silently support anyone brave enough to get up infront of strangers and sing - whether good or not. Drunk coppers on the other hand...

""COS IM YOUR LAAAAAADYYYYY
AND YOOOOU ARE MY MAAAAAAAAN""

If the above was in tune it might have been bearable and might not have attracted the increasingly legless coppers attention. Despite being half an hour long. However - the girly singing it (who had recently had a baby judging by her oh-so-clear strech marks) was bloody awful. And my coppers let her know so. In very loud voices and some very obvious hand signals. I stopped them by stating that they were being ""horrid"" - and then came the challenge. 

""Get up there Marvin and sing...""

Shortly followed by some chicken noises... and some chanting..

So - bearing in mind I hardly ever turn down a challenge and never when followed by chicken noises - I chose ""Signed Sealed Delivered"" - following the most awful duet of ""Love lift us up where we belong"" by two tuneless twats..

I was good. Sod that I was very good. Stevie Wonder - I can do. Kate Bush - I cannot. What does this say about my vocal range? Anyway - some of the coppers who have known me a while were actually in stunned silence. Mouths open, some with Carling dripping down their shirts. Its a wonderful thing when you realise you still have the ability to suprise yourself. Especially when getting over a cold.

My policeman got up and sang Sweet Child O Mine, then decided to sing it to me (too late I was headbanging by this stage). Copper after copper started filtering away, some had lifts, some walked, and some will probably never be seen again..

My policeman and I walked to the nick, and a good thing about my job is that everytime he tried to grope me in the street I said ""CAMERAS!"" in a loud voice. Being in the job and married means you dont want to be taped doing anything you shouldnt. Im not proud of this as its an incredibly whorish thing to do - but yes. I had sex in a police station (no - not a cell) with a married policeman. The disabled shower. Hard ceramic floors. Had to be quiet the whole time. Not the best arrangement. Plus he had a bus to catch.

I got a cab (ordinary not metcab) home and had a lovely chat with the driver about where Orpington stops and the Cray starts...

<lj-cut>
Having an chat with a female colleague about how my weight is just not shifting no matter how much walking I do (50mins to an hour a day when Im not working) and no matter how much I watch what Im eating (with two home-made salads sitting next to me).

My colleague Dan then pipes up and starts being really harsh. ""You're obviously not trying hard enough."" was the one that stuck in my mind. The he started on my salads saying that new pots and pasta were full of carbs and Im obviously not doing the exercise to burn off my intake. I said if he thought they were no good I could always add lumps of LARD to my salads. Given what I used to eat - potatoes and pasta was a step up.

He says my exercise is obviously not sufficient to burn up my intake. Even though if I do have a treat (chinese or choccy bar) I feel guilty about it and make up for it by eating nothing the next day. Ok - so what does he suggest? Obviously a step up from walking is jogging - and theres no WAY I can do that. Well - jog for five minutes he says. Then jog for six the next day etc... So when I get shooting pains and my left arm goes numb - will he be there to call the ambulance???

I must admit when I walked home from Sidcup the other day (took an hour down the A20 and Sevenoaks Way) I was only red when I got home and hardly sweating at all. So ok - my body's used to walking. That doesnt mean that doing an hour of it should make no difference to my fitness. And it shouldnt mean that I stop losing weight because of it.

It ended with him saying Im obviously not trying because if I did the walking and the dieting I say Im doing I would be thin by now. I attempt to explain that my condition makes me fat and makes it incredibly hard to lose the weight because of the hormonal/chemical/metabolic imbalance. He basically said that sounds like ""bollocks"" and Im just lazy.

I replied - ""Dan, this condition is going to KILL me. At what point do you think I would not try to save my own life?""

Crying in the loos at work before 11am. We are ok now, and I love him to bits but I could have pulled his lungs out I was so angry. This man is tall and thin and eats like a horse. Its so much easier to keep weight off if you never had it in the first place."

Four deaths during the day yesterday - two fatal accidents, one suicide (selfish bitch did it during her daughters GCSE's) and one Elvis-death, old man in a public toilet. Broke my heart when his wife wandered into the station office at Orpington wondering where he was.
""Dont tell me hes gone off with someone else - we've been married 53 years so he wouldnt do that!""

OH. GOD. 

""Andy? Ive sent this old lady home - pls confirm its her hubby who died on the toilet and go tell her will you? I shall have an ambulance message standing by...""

The worst bit of course is we then had no-one available for anything. So with 47 unassigned and 7 emergency calls sitting there, Im about ready to lob my controller out the third floor window cos hes being a DICK. Seriously - when did someone decide that you're obviously good enough to be a manager just because the previous controller got put back on the street and you got the job by default? Being a good controller - does NOT automatically make you a good manager. 

My job is stressful enough without this boring sexist ugly fuckarse sticking his nose in where its not wanted. I should have got him fired when I had the chance."

"event","Night out with the guys last night, pub, pub, club kinda deal. Ended up with me assisting in breaking up a fight between five coppers and being questioned by their Guvna... How the hell do these things happen?

Someone said something to someone else in Jazzmingers in Bromley, it moved outside (assisted by the bouncers) so when me and Karina arrived outside it was in full flow. Pushing and shoving mostly - your usual displays of testosterone - but some shoves that looked really painful. So there we were doing the girlie thing, pulling them apart, trying to make them listen. At least my ""leave it""'s were sensible. ""We are being filmed, do you want to get nicked? Do you want to lose your job?"" My mate Judy has already called saying ""What the f-"" after seeing us on the cameras.

So the two causing the trouble leave, then come back cos they need to get a cab.. so it nearly kicks off again. They are deliberately trying to wind up the others and it takes me and another copper to hold one of them off, Karina bundling the other two in a cab and telling them to stop winding him up. Then three police cars show up, and the Guv. He did not look happy. Positive policing and all that. Hes just said for the main instigators to be in his office on Monday.

Then this morning when making bacon butties for everyone who stayed at Karinas, my friend Sarah (copper) calls me and tells me we could all be arrested for affray. I did reply that we were breaking it up and that is obvious on the camera footage. ""Doesnt matter"" - she says - ""You two were involved"". Im thinking by this point - ""What ... ever"".

The same rules dont apply anymore. This sort of thing never happened 20 years ago because police officers were carefully chosen. Now they let in any old rubbish just for the numbers. To think of the oldest three coppers I know having a fight is ludicrous. These guys shocked me last night - I always figured no matter how much alcohol their training should return to them and they should be able to handle this kind of thing. But when it comes down to it now, theyre violent selfish morons now all the time. They dont need to care anymore."

<lj-cut>

I got to the site early, and it became evident that certain people (bastards) werent going to show up. We got warning of one copper from his colleagues that he was stuck somewhere, but he had paid his deposit so I wasnt bothered. A civvie who failed to show however, didnt tell me and hasnt paid her deposit will be paying up soon. I have sent her a nasty email.

So there were eleven of us in t'end. It was still really good thanks to some renegade cops who thought short range was best (I got one of them right between the eyes and was well pleased), some excellant staff at the site who put up with us all day and some smokebombs. Heh heh heh...

My only problem was my glasses fogged up for the first half of the game, then when I took them off I couldnt see for the second half. Getting contacts for next time methinks. I would like to say it was the running around making my glasses fog up - but I had failed to realise before this occasion how good my dear friend Edward looks in camoflage overalls. And I have told him so. Seeing him run around the woods with a gun looking a bit IRA had me thinking naughty thoughts.... I kept getting shot because of this alone...

The best bit was ""The Fort"" - where one team was inside and the other out, and the idea was for the other team to storm it. As it were. We were inside first and kept them out. Then we were outside second and stormed it to fuck...! This is where the smokebombs came in handy. Thankfully we werent told about the ""right to surrender"" until after this so we just shot 'em.

I refused to wear a hood as they just looked so bad and obstructed even more of my view, so my hair got full of paint. However - when shot in the back of the head - the paintball got caught in my hair and didnt splat! The marshall pulled it perfectly formed out of my ponytail. Excellant! I am immortal!

A few of us slightly minging civvies and a copper went for a quick drink after, me with yellow hair and all the staff looking at us worriedly...

An excellant day - they want to do one in the summer. I think they may be trying to kill me. This was February and as warm as I wish to go."

Barely 10 MINUTES LATER - we were talking about what a great time New York was - when she said -""I'll definately go back there in a couple of years"".

This girl does not seem to get it. I know my trip to NY in December was the last time I'll be getting on a plane for a while - simply because I want my own place and I wont be able to afford holidays if Im saving up. Holidays are a luxury the single girl who still lives at home CANNOT afford.

"event","Well that long saga that was ""Should Bee return to Oz with the possibility of getting thrown out again"" has now ended. Im fairly disappointed tho - apparently her Manager (who accused her of stealing) couldnt handle her CRYING... This I have a problem with. But - whatever gets her out of paying back any money and gives the option to stay is a good thing. She may not stay anyway.

<lj-cut text=Forthelongandshortofit...>

Well - New Years Day my best friend (who is home from Oz for three weeks) gets an email from her manager (shes been out there two years) saying basically ""Read this - you may not want to come back. You owe us this this and that - and we think you've been claiming too much commission (she works in a Health club as a manager) on your sales."" My first though - bastard. Hes trying to scare her into staying so he doesnt have to bother with all her benefits or holiday pay or explaining why she been on less than minimum wage for two years. Anyone else I know would have stayed - sent a big cheque for whatever he quoted and forgotten about going back. He dont know her at all. She has a cat over there.

So emails back and forth - hes now mentioning the police and court (I assured her the police would not be interested, this is civil, not criminal, and he can only threaten her with court if she refuses to pay back the money) Im getting increasingly angry and looking on t'internet for cheap flights to Oz...

Anyway - she went in there for her ""informal"" meeting yesterday - taking her friend Miranda who's a Human Resources Manager elsewhere (hurrah!) and he's given in. Its fairly obvious he didnt expect her to show up, and he realises he didnt have a leg to stand on. Bee was only concerned about him getting immigration involved who could chuck her out of the country in 28 days. I told her it would raise too many questions with him about immgration. Like - minimum wage? Holiday pay? Benefits? Grasping c*nt?

I still have an almost overwhelming urge to fly over there and torch the place, but if Bee is going to stay she might need him for a reference. Anyway - next job is all set up, she starts on Monday - chain of health clubs, so everything by the book - and hopefully she'll stay. I dont want her in this country, I hate it. Plus she'll be in the same position as me if she comes back, unable to buy but earning a lot less."

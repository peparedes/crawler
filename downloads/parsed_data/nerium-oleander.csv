"event","<p>So busy. This, accompanying pages and pages was the weekend before last:</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.nicollecjones.com/images/weekend_watching.jpg"" height=""632"" width=""475"" /></p>
<p>Mmmm, Paul Newman. Ocean&#8217;s 13 is hiding under that Lupin III disk, excellent pairing fyi. The Doctor Who disk is season 24 &amp; 25, which I like to have running around 4AM when I abandon the french press for <strike>Coke</strike> liquid candy. The Ashes to Ashes has now become a compulsion. Last night I watched it again while reading the script. Matthew Graham is just butter. Delicious, awesome, steal-worthy, hate-inducing butter. Why yes, Gene Hunt + angst does addle my brain, <em>p</em><span class=""binomial""><em>haseolus limensis</em></span>. (Angst more so in the first script than the episode itself, but my mouth waters for new episodes). Untouchables after Fear &amp; Loathing was hysterical deluxe awesome. Nominations for this weekend are now open if you&#8217;d like to leave a comment&#8230;</p>
<p>Week was dedicated to pages, realizations, more pages.</p>
<p>Past weekend was lost to people, booze and party-like activities. I&#8217;m having trouble remembering exactly what went down, except that Bart will never construct a functional computer and Cory brought some season 2 LOST and I got to watch some proto-Locke, Swan Hatch action.  Cowboy Bebop was in there. Also there&#8217;s a hole in my floor now, bastards. So much for knuckling down&#8230;</p>
<p>Here, we see Baby Fritz does not suffer fools:</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.nicollecjones.com/images/fritz_peeps.jpg"" height=""358"" width=""477"" /></p>

"event","<p>I should qualify that I want to tell a damn story well. I left the &#8216;well&#8217; out in last post, but it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that it&#8217;s an on-going process that must include an audience.</p>
<p>Some declarations before I continue: The increased amount of scripts, screenwriters and films was a natural consequence of Modernization. One major offense of modernization was that the demand for quantity overtook the confidence in and the desire for quality. These are self perpetuating problems and we cannot rely on the Machinery of films (studios, distributors, agencies, etc) or audiences to do anything to correct.</p>
<p>When I think about these things, it seems pretty overwhelming. If I begin loathing my audience it&#8217;s going to come through in the writing and will only damage the story. Who the fuck needs that static? All I can really do is to turn it around and let it drive the desire to improve my own writing. But maybe I can channel it to improve all fellow screenwriters. Improve every damn script. Improve the machinery. Improve the audience. Otherwise my stories may eventually have nowhere to go.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m hung up on this idea of the Revolution&#8211; because I feel so small against all of it. I don&#8217;t even know if I am improving myself, how can I possibly do anything else? Got no agent. Don&#8217;t live in LA. I have no names to drop or major studio pitch horror stories. I can&#8217;t get past the first round of Nicholl. I feel completely without means sometimes. But I&#8217;m not alone. I&#8217;ve got the blogs, the Scribosphere. I&#8217;m lucky to have an online workshop with some incredibly smart and brilliant writers. And I&#8217;ve got the great writing that does make it to theaters and into my head and makes my skull just explode. Those things are a big enough part of me that I can&#8217;t just cut them loose. So nevertheless, I&#8217;m in it. I fight.</p>
<p>Little fish that I am, I can&#8217;t get the image of a Guerrilla war out of my head. Small groups of revolutionaries fighting a larger, less mobile, formal establishment. (Maybe I&#8217;ve just been reading too much Strike coverage.) The establishment here being the dumbing down, the decay, the quantity over quality. But the Internet, my single greatest resource, is pooled intelligence, communication and comradery. What other resources does a guerrilla need?</p>
<p>Web-savy writers are already starting to use this stuff. Anybody who wants to be a writer *needs* to be using it. There are a ton of forums. Communities like <a href=""http://www.zoetrope.com/index.cgi"" target=""_blank"">Zoetrope </a>and <a href=""http://www.triggerstreet.com"" target=""_blank"">Triggerstreet </a>give fledgling scribes somewhere to start looking for feedback. The <a href=""http://www.scribomatic.com/recent_posts.php?startat=0"" target=""_blank"">Scribomatic </a>is aggregating all kinds of insightful blogs now. Who knows how many little private workshop groups are online? It&#8217;s the perfect staging ground and the knowledge and information is getting out there.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s missing? From my own experience I feel like there&#8217;s a shitload of stuff available with which to educate yourself. You don&#8217;t have to drop ungodly hordes of money for school or coverage or script services. The dumbing down is more than an absence of information, it&#8217;s also a lack of work ethic- the lack of craftsmanship. There is a thought that revolutions demand bloodshed and I think that&#8217;s what writing demands- blood on the page. Effort is going back and drafting the spec again and again and again. You sweat. Killing your babies, cutting a great line of dialogue or whole characters, making it perfect&#8211; That&#8217;s blood. And it&#8217;s the only way to get the story to the next level. And you gotta do this over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Writing well is difficult and the word &#8216;work&#8217; doesn&#8217;t cut it. Everyone who sits down to write a story *thinks* they&#8217;re putting work into it. You gotta call it blood. My scripts need blood. Maybe I need to put a little more blood in my blog.</p>

"event","<p>Been across the country and back since the last post, had a birthday and then sports, people, serious. As a rule NHL Hockey and Major League Baseball are the only two sports I make an effort to stay current on, but in December it&#8217;s hard not to catch a slight Football Fever or occasional Basketball Cold Sore. By January I am usually into the NFL playoffs (although my loyalty is a random, logic-less whore) and this year it&#8217;s no different. This past weekend particularly was full of some sexy athletic action. Action I would like to share with you here and now, on my pointless little blog:</p>
<p><lj-embed id=""20"" /></p>
<p>For this reason alone, I will be pulling for the NY Giants. Sorry about the loss, <a href=""http://planetpooks.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">Pooks</a>, but it&#8217;s all about the Carl-man.</p>

"event","<p>If you missed it, and I wouldn&#8217;t blame you if you did, Shia LaBeouf announced the name of the new Indy film last night at <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1569264/20070909/story.jhtml"" target=""_blank""> some MTV event or another</a>. Officially dubbed: <a href=""http://www.indianajones.com/site/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a> which isn&#8217;t horrible, but does push the edge of wordy without being exceptionally exciting. What gives about the KotCS, anyway?</p>
<p align=""center"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><img src=""http://www.nicollecjones.com/images/crystal_kopf.png"" title=""Can we get a Daniel Carter namedrop, at least?"" alt=""Can we get a Daniel Carter namedrop, at least?"" height=""457"" width=""350"" /></p>
<p>Well, if you didn&#8217;t catch the episode of  <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074007/"" target=""_blank"">In Search Of&#8230;</a> OR the rather entertaining <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118480/"" target=""_blank"">Stargate SG:1</a> episode that exploited the crystal skull concept, the gist is there are about a dozen of these <a href=""http://www.rickrichards.com/skull/Skull1.htm"" target=""_blank"">ancient crystal skulls</a> that may be linked to the Aztecs and/or aliens that have some sort of magic power and/or supernatural communication abilities. It would suggest that maybe the maguffin is the <a href=""http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/index.php?one=azt&amp;two=aaa&amp;id=294&amp;typ=reg"" target=""_blank"">magical crystal skulls of South &amp; Latin Americas</a>, belonging to some mysterious Kingdom which may be a City of Gods, who may/may not be aliens. You&#8217;ve got to admit that&#8217;s a heck of a lot for five words to suggest.</p>
<p>Tone-wise there&#8217;s a slight Temple of Doom-ness to it, even Infernal Machine with the possibility of multiple artifacts being keys to something larger and possibly sinister since the Aztecs invoke more Pagan than Christian themes. (Neither a pro or a con IMO, since I like Temple of Doom just fine, thankyewveddymuch.) The alien vibe&#8211; something that&#8217;s been around since the &#8216;Saucer Men&#8217; script&#8211; is an angle that always appealed to me and comes hand-in-hand with the mysterious skulls. Throw in all the Area 51 buzz and I feel justified at making the connection. Look to type of previous Indy adventures and you can even pull Nazis out of the title, since South America post-WWII is pretty much equivalent with escaped Nazis, so lets get one more dig in on those bastards while we&#8217;re at it.</p>
<p>So KotCS definitely sounds interesting and bursting with potential, but for all that&#8217;s there, it doesn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> feel like the penultimate Indiana Jones adventure to me. This may be because I liked the SG1 episode and so there&#8217;s a hint of been-there-done-that tarnish, but it sure won&#8217;t keep me out of the theater. What does tickle me about it&#8211; aside from the awesomeness that is Karen Allen being back&#8211; is that Spielberg/Lucas may go all out and our hero, the erstwhile Indiana Jones- student of the entire course of human events, boy scout, and smart mouth- may end up in space or talking to aliens and completely out of his depth. And that sounds like a helluva lot of fun.</p>
<p>But that name. It&#8217;s just not quite right&#8230; Not the wordiness and I like the acronymity of it- KotCS&#8230; But that &#8216;Kingdom&#8217; bit needs a qualifier&#8230; something to invoke  the peril, the danger, the momentum. How about:</p>
<p><strong>Indiana Jones and the <em>Lost</em> Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</strong></p>
<p>Ahhh, well. It not much, sure, but <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/""> Raiders</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087469/"" target=""_blank"">Doom</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097576/"" target=""_blank""> Last</a>,  <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245165/"" target=""_blank"">Fate</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245166/"" target=""_blank"">Infernal</a>&#8230; there&#8217;s a certain <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0872111/"" target=""_blank"">precedent</a>, and I&#8217;d say give the Kingdom it&#8217;s due.</p>

<p>Last week Cory sent me a link to a rap video that expresses an unusual sentiment- <strike>for Cory at least, since he may in fact be illiterate,</strike> that people should make and effort to read books among other things. A few explicit lyrics so check your speakers if at work:</p>

"event","<p>I&#8217;ve found myself in an interesting situation lately as I&#8217;m working on three different stories at the same time after having worked on one story, N&amp;D, almost exclusively for a very long time. So I&#8217;m juggling a lot more than I&#8217;ve been used to and trying to develop these three stories and characters whereas with N&amp;D I knew the characters and most of my time and effort was dedicated in just getting the script to highlight the greatest aspects of the characters.</p>
<p>Cause I&#8217;ll say it again, story is character.</p>
<p>So with N&amp;D I was honestly in mad obsessive love with my characters. They are as complete and as fully realized and as anything I&#8217;ve ever done and that&#8217;s one of the reasons I consider N&amp;D to be my first, real, successful script. (Never mind the half dozen I&#8217;ve written previous). The story in N&amp;D is very much about Max and Edison and the dynamics between the two while crazy things are going on around them and that was ALWAYS the heart of the script throughout every version. I know Max and Ed and I love Max and Ed. I can hear their voices. I can have conversations with them, hell I got silly at one point and &#8216;interviewed&#8217; them about what happens after my script so I could get a handle on what needed to be in the script, you know? At any given moment, I can know what they&#8217;re arguing about, because have no doubt, they will be arguing unless otherwise engaged&#8230; And yet, they never fail to surprise me. Maybe this is schizophrenia, but they are honestly complete personalities enclosed in my head. And god, I love it! Screenwriting = Madness.</p>
<p>But for all the excitement and all the ideas for that I have for Max and Ed I know it&#8217;s necessary to move on. Which is where I&#8217;m a little snagged- in one of the things I&#8217;m working on now I have a protag who I realized this weekend, that I don&#8217;t especially like. Which is weird because I made the guy, right? I started him out with some of my favorite attributes and gave him some clever dialogue and defining moments. He is very different from Max and Ed and thus it&#8217;s a different kind of story. I&#8217;ve worked for a while at giving him a good solid arc and throwing him into quicksand, giving him depth- but his voice isn&#8217;t anywhere near as clear as Max and Ed were for me and that&#8217;s hurting dialogue, character dynamics, motivation, fucking everything. Realizing that I could take or leave him makes me feel like a bad parent. I can&#8217;t write a script about a character who I&#8217;m so lukewarm about- rather, I COULD, but I&#8217;m not going to. He is the bastard step-child in my mind, angry that I almost inevitably end up thinking- &#8216;You are not as cool as Max and Ed.&#8217; He sulks a lot. He&#8217;s a loner. None of which lend him to being a very likable protagonist- or hasn&#8217;t yet. There is something missing in him that he&#8217;s not too eager to share with me and it&#8217;s fucking up my script, which is in turn pissing me off. He&#8217;s got to carry this script after all! If he doesn&#8217;t cut it out he&#8217;s going back to the bottom of the work pile cause the gal and company in the other new script are being just a tad more accessible and have room for more potential awesome likability.</p>
<p>And threatening him just isn&#8217;t getting me anywhere cause the bastard thinks he&#8217;s Holden Caufield and doesn&#8217;t give a flying fuck about me finishing my script.</p>

"event","<p>Simply Scripts posted a link to the Coen&#8217;s <a href=""http://www.youknow-forkids.com/No_Country_For_Old_Men_2.pdf"" target=""_blank"">No Country for Old Men</a> today- thanks much to &#8216;<a href=""http://www.youknow-forkids.com"" target=""_blank"">You know, for Kids&#8217;</a> sharing this as it&#8217;s one of my most anticipated flicks right now. Big recommend if you haven&#8217;t read the novel- hell, big recommend no matter what. I&#8217;ve always found the Coen&#8217;s scripts to be exceptionally visual and well-written. Also, I honestly expect Cormac McCarthy + the Coen Bros to be astounding. The fact that I&#8217;ve got a history of fandom with both AND Tommy Lee Jones, probably means I&#8217;ll be a little less sane after viewing the flick, but I have faith it&#8217;ll be worthwhile.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to finish Script Frenzy. I might manage the 20,000 words by the end of the month, but it&#8217;s not going to be a coherent plot and not something I&#8217;d force anyone to read. This doesn&#8217;t worry me, I&#8217;ve been clocking in a lot of pages and developing a lot of the Braxton Frame story- but I&#8217;m working on Gallows Gulch at the same time. I don&#8217;t count it as a failure though because SF functioned the way I wanted it to- it got me writing when I&#8217;d been really bogged down.  If I come out of the Summer with two new draft scripts- which I honestly feel on track for- I&#8217;ll be happy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I&#8217;ve again come to the conclusion I&#8217;m a complete moron for even pondering the idea I could write something.  I guess this is tradition. Maybe my spleen will explode and save the world any further drafts of my hackneyed delusions.</p>

"event","<p>Screwed up my sleep sched today so I thought a good use of my time would be to cop to signing up for <a href=""http://www.scriptfrenzy.org/eng/user/184366"" target=""_blank"">Script Frenzy</a>. There&#8217;s a good chance that if I don&#8217;t mention it I&#8217;ll wander off and forget about it and honestly blogging doesn&#8217;t really hold me that much more accountable, but every fractional bit helps. If anyone else has signed up and wants to add me that might provide further guilting.</p>
<p>That said, for SF I have a new idea I&#8217;m going to tackle- in addition to continuing to draft Gallows Gulch and hammering out some honest to god <a href=""http://www.nicollecjones.com/clips/nd_pitch6.mp3"" target=""_blank"">pitch-like-things.</a> (Which, if you have 90 seconds, I would love to hear some feedback on. Also it&#8217;s better with beer, but really what isn&#8217;t?) I haven&#8217;t done any pitch-fests or anything in the past and aside from a lot of reading have no experience in it, so it&#8217;s time I got off my ass.</p>
<p>In other pitching news- okay what the hell Chicago? Here I was ready for another year of bitter griping and you jump from last to second I the NL Central. With the Brewers at no. 1 even. It&#8217;s awesome, but strange in an apocalyptic kind of way. I&#8217;m going to have to check the August sched to see if there&#8217;s a good looking matchup on deck, cause I want to get up there this summer.</p>
<p>And before I try and get back to sleep, I have thoughts on LOST for the two folks that read the blog and also enjoy the show, but I&#8217;ll save it or the weekend when I&#8217;m drunk and incoherent. Well, more incoherent.</p>

And I even went out of my way to buy some Marmalade this weekend when I already had one kind in my fridge. I&#8217;m drinking tea right now, Irish Breakfast if you&#8217;re curious. But I&#8217;m clearly on some sort of Brit-kick, so be warned.</p>

<p>I will explain the title of the post in a second, but I want to comment on last night&#8217;s HOUSE, episode <a href=""http://www.tv.com/house/resignation/episode/1030483/summary.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=episodessh&amp;tag=episodes;title;1"" target=""_blank"">3&#215;22 &#8216;Resignation&#8217;</a>, which I felt was again in top form. This season has had some phenominal episodes, Son of Coma Guy, Informed Consent, but the March-April plots were doing nothing for me and the characterization really felt flat. Last week and this week really pulled me back in with reinforced plot elements and backstory- and but damn Wilson cracked out on speed was hilarious. The wink ALONE was worth a million dollars. So brilliant. A lot of sharp dialogue and gasp! Progression in House himself. Wonders never cease. A few things really stick out- Cameron waltzing up into House&#8217;s pad, intentionally familiar in what I suppose is the writers trying to explode a few brains out there. I also want to give Foreman hugs. They&#8217;ve done a great job over the course of the entire show priming him for this realization and I love it&#8217;s getting stretched and played between both House and Foreman, but diffusing through other character reactions. Some very nice emotional structure here and good writing. Love.<img src=""http://www.nicollecjones.com/images/stories/icons/dr_10_timelord.png"" align=""right"" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile re: last post title, I am completely cracked out on Doctor Who now. It doesn&#8217;t fail- because BSG goes off the air and then DW comes on in March, so the obsession train keeps on rolling. But it&#8217;s off this weekend, so I&#8217;m going to show Megan and Jeremy the first two series, last weekend I showed Cory and Mary a few. Which is typical- I insist on sharing the awesome. I&#8217;m a plague carrier as far as television goes. It gets a recommend, least of all because David Tennant is exceptionally nice to look at.</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.nicollecjones.com/images/stories/sfclock-1.jpg"" align=""right"" height=""150"" width=""150"" />So Stephen Fry. Yes.  I don&#8217;t know how I missed this, but <a href=""http://www.boingboing.net/"" target=""_blank"">BoingBoing</a> dutifully informed me this morning that I can get an <a href=""http://voco.uk.com/"" target=""_blank"">Stephen Fry alarmclock</a> and dear God help me, I need it! Not only that, but the makers released the samples via CreativeCommons, so if you navigate to the &#8216;Downloads&#8217; section of their website you can download your own Stephen Fry wake-up sounds for phone, computer, whatever. The Good Morning Madam ones- all of them actually are hilarious. And I can scarcely imagine a better way to wake up without possibly facing criminal charges.</p>

"event","<p>Great, great, great flick. Plot summaries are lame, so I&#8217;m just going to fellate the filmmakers here, skip it if that bores you. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0670408/"" target=""_blank"">Simon Pegg</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942367/"">Edgar Wright</a> and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0296545/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Frost</a> are guys I will pledge to buy unlimited beers for from now until the end of time. I could be living in a box with a jar of pennies as my last monetary possession and if these boys showed up, I would gladly use every last thin cent for their intoxication.</p>
<p>First of all, I would have agreed with this sentiment after seeing <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/"" target=""_blank"">Shaun of the Dead</a>- I wouldn&#8217;t have gone to the next-level hyperbole, but that movie gets nothing but love from me. The moment it became an on-pain-of-death oath was the invocation of Chinatown in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/"" target=""_blank"">Hot Fuzz</a>. The second my brain processed it, laughed out loud (yes, I&#8217;m the annoying person behind you) only to be met with complete silence. From what I could tell, no one else in the theater got it or thought it was so clearly goddamned hilarious. Sure there was much laughing at the many action-love-fest lines, Bad Boys camera spins, Unforgiven main street reaction CUs and etcs, but not Chinatown?! It was an unmitigated moment of awesome. So Ed, Nick and Simon- you guys will always have a unlimited pint on credit with me.</p>
<p>It should be noted- I love good, fun over the top cheese for the sake of cheese. It&#8217;s a product of my childhood enjoyment of movies where I would see something impossible and not know it was impossible. The wonder, the innocence of movies, goddammit! That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. This is just as important to me as delivering a message, making critical and important observations of humanity and culture, and all the wonderful things that movies do and why I love them. I appreciate reviewing History&#8217;s greatest tragedies and recognizing the emotions those sorts of films stir in me. And I like deconstucting an insanely complex metaphor as much as the next girl.</p>
<p>But I like watching shit blow the fuck up, too.</p>
<p>This is why I love Edgar Wright and Co, because they geniunely understand this sentiment and make films accordingly. And yeah, there&#8217;s a streak of bitch in me that likes getting jokes no one else does, but I try not to be obnoxious about it. I&#8217;m sure I fail spectacularly. But I&#8217;m not alone, and if you can appreciate any of this, then there should be plenty about Hot Fuzz that you&#8217;ll enjoy and I demand you watch it, blog about it, fucking whatever to raise these boys&#8217; stock in the film industry (and I don&#8217;t even know if it&#8217;s even all that low, but where ever it is, it needs to be higher) because this is the stuff I want to see more of. And if you have a problem with that, I may have to kill you.</p>
<p align=""left"">So much love.</p>

But fear not, because craptastic_inc gave me an idea of just what I could use it for, since I've been all icon crazy lately. it's kinda addictive this icon making sickness, that tends to fuel whatever obsession of the moment i'm into.

speaking of which, let's briefly mention what i've failed to mention here:
The Question, Dead Like Me, Battlestar Galactica, Doctor Who, Dead Like Me, Rube, Dead Like Me.

That about brings us current. Anyway, I may or may not be posting iconage as I see fit. Short attention span and all that."

I'm also trying to RSS the dot com, so i won't have to update as much, but unforutnately, it won't be on this account. all the dot com entries will show up in my friends thread though.

another wave of deadlines soon, and catch up with the left door. tax return is spent, and going to greenville this weekend. i lead a charmed life."

house tonight. so i got that going for me, which is good...

did Jeeves and Wooster vol 1 and Coffee and Cigarettes this past weekend. Excellent all around. Plots With a View is waiting for me. I watched enough to see Fred dance, and then died.

taxes are done for the most part.

HOUSE. 

MONSTER TRUCKS.

*dies*

I continue to love how Hugh Laurie is so tangible as that character. Excellent writing continues. Fox needs to get a death grip on this series. Now if the powers that be would get right on pressing those season 1 DVDs I'd be much obliged, thanks.  

the dot com is getting a little more extensive as i add to it when i can. i've decided i'm going to syndicate my blog over there with this one, just to cut down on the amount of work i have to put into cross posting. now if DA would just suck up some rss feeds i could cover all bases. so keep an eye out for format changing over here. 

busy busy busy continues. one comp entry sent off yesterday, came to mental terms with 'letting go' so it was a nice moment of writer evolution for me. STAINLESS is about as finished as it is going to be unless someone pays me to redraft it. It is what it is, and hopefully it'll resonate with a few people as it makes the comp rounds. 

new script first draft is about 56 pages in, expecting this one to be about 120+. Kinda a horse compared to my others, but a fast paced and actiony horse. getting good feedback on the idea thus far.

and shooting this weekend went well. just pickup exteriors, so i'm much looking forward to the meat of the production. it's a fun project and i think Scott's going to have a very nice little short film when we're done.

"event","i am so incredibly busy, and yet it doesn't annoy me.

first up are annual screenwriting deadlines. these are all massively grouped from the end of Feb to the beginning of May. I've got one script I'm doing and I'm hacking out another completely opposite genre story, that I may just throw out in the mix because I love the characters so much.

second i have agreed to be the DP on a short film for a friend in greenville. it's a small project, but full crew, casting, eccoutrements, e'erything. casting is tonight in gville and i leave at about 3pm. oh yeah i also have to storyboard the project and do it well. i need some primas. (no monies!)

third i've redesigned the dot com with Mambo CMS and I'm tyring to get content up there so when the scripts go out I look somewhat professional. i think it looks good, but it's still sparse. 

fourth- work, yeah that place i go 8 hours a day. doing a redesign there with Mambo as well. 

fifth i have a drawing i have been working on since dec that i need to finish and get up here for someone. it's bizarre, but i like it.

sixth i need to invest time in the continued worship of otto/fred. 

seventh my tv schedule is hectic! FOOK I forgot to see the tivo for LOST tonight- shit, I will have to hit the apartment before I leave for greenville. damn.

and lastly I have decided to enter :iconrobertjohnson: 's contest. cause i do love the GBs and it's a nice definitive goal to keep me drawing. which is good. 

damn and other lastly, i have photos to scan and upload. and more b&w film to shoot. and movies to watch, and books to read and damn i seriously need some more hours in the day.

hence the sporadicism (is that a word?) of my updates. all in all i'm kinda chill about everything though."

"event","Okay folks, this is me, quivering. With rage or some other unnamable emotion that probably will get chalked up to yet another angry blog post. But allow me this respite, just once, and you'll never see a ramen noodle post again! Also if you stay tuned in, I'll give you ample reason why the South is a mass of fuckheads, why Local and state government is no better than that horrible pigrape that is our federal government and if you go for that whole, Police Wildest Chases/COPS lowbrow entertainment value, I'll even throw some of that out as well.

SOOOooooo, onwards to gripeville.

2 motherfucking whore bastard inches of snow, rare front out of the SW as it may be, should not fucking RAPE a major metropolitan area. I mean I'm not even sure it was 2 the point is that the amount of snow RDU receieved today was comprable to Rosie O'Donnell's cock- rather small and unwanted.

Today I had the pleasure of having a drive that I make in 30 minutes every morning explode to 7 of the most UNHOLY hours I've spent on the face of this planet. By 4 hours, I was a third of the way home, and averaging less than 1 mph by my addled calculations. Music, being the balm to my soul as it is, was of no help, as the MOTHERFUCKING RADIO STATIONS felt the need to do nothing but talk about how INSANE, and unexpected the traffic seemed to be tonight.

The cell service was knocked out for a good 4 hours, but since I forgot my phone today, it made no difference.

One good thing, the school children got let out early, which further fucked the situation as I hear there are still buses that can deliver their wards home, not 10 hours later. These unfortunate whelps are being driven to the local hospitals. Free tetnus ass shots for all. 

At about 3 pm I worried that I hadn't set my DVR to catch Lost tonight, but though surely 5 hours will be plenty to get home. Oh Godm you wily bastard, you got me good that time.

Oh remember that time where the bastard tried to pass me and rammed the guardrail and almost richocheting into me- yeah that was funny. Like a hot poker, in the ass and a salt in the eye chaser.

City planning (salt) trucks and police don't do much good stuck in the motherfucking DITCHES.

And folks, abandoning your car because it has run out of gas in the middle of various roads, highways, interstates and whatever backwater motherfucking roads it was I managed to make my way home on- yeah, no... next time I'm ramming the bitches.

Lessons learned: 
NC is the south, despite the assfucking pathetic attempt at labling itself ""North"".
No one on this godforsaken planet can drive.
I need to keep a pillow and change of clothes in my desk at work.
Children should be the first sacrificed in the upcoming Ice Age.

Good things of the day:
Seeing a cop in uniform fall on his ass while directing traffic.
Hoping the bastards I left Chapel Hill with are still fucking stuck on 40.
Spending less time at work all day than I spent on the road... wait, no...

So, anyone else stucking this godawful mess, just me? Yeah, thought so..."

"event","You know what's odd? I look back at the ealierst 2004 entry and there I am talking about being Obsessed with Star Wars Galaxies. And then, I look at my latest entry and, it too is about Star Wars Galaxies. And I think to myself ""Self, you don't really play all that much, yet it's coming across quite the opposite,"" and I wonder exactly how skewed the impartial perspective on my life may be judging from my live journal.

And then I get distracted by a shiny light, penny or a television commercial. Cause it ain't really matter that much anyhows. 

But it did occur to me that it would be interesting to look back on my Jan 2005 entries come 2006 and see how things have played out. Fun thing about LJs, you can see what you were doing back whenever. If that's your bag. Which, for me it apparently is. So currently:

I'm somewhat obsessed over the Space Expasion of Star Wars Galaxies. It's fun blowing shit up, and killing people. Like Counter Strike, except, in space, with Star Wars sound effects. Makes it doubly as enjoyable.

Developed a thing for Mr. Molina since the release of Spiderman 2- ended up with many Ock Themed christmas items, and broke in the new processor by screenshotting Chocolat. Which is a great movie. Johnny Depp. Molina. Get thee to a video store.

Doing something new in the script dept, still going to school and various approaches and elements, and character creation. We'll see how it works out. I'm still a no talent hack, hopefully this will become less true next January.

Also established three big goals for writing this year:
*3 Major Comp entries.
*1 New Completed Spec
*Complete 1 Old Spec

all other standard resolutions apply...

Brett just went back to 29 Palms after his Xmas vacation, only one major bit of drama that ended up with me walking 10 or so blocks through downtown Raleigh at about 10pm. It was all very dumb, but without coat I was sniffling by the time i got home.

...which may be in fact why i'm am still/continually sick. cough, hack, head congestion. it's a perpetual thing now. whatever.

in the greatest moment of irony yet this year (note it's only 4 days old), sunday night i was conned out of 40$. mostly because i wasn't paying attention, and i seem to have little regard for my safety. here's the story:
<i>About 10 pm some guy comes knocking on my door saying he's all locked out, can he use my phone to call locksmith, yadda yadda, I'm so out of it, I just go with it, like some surreal lapse of intelligence, I let the guy use the phone and then as he's espouting randon patter, I actually give him money for the locksmith. 30$. And as he leaves, with my money, I think to myself, ""Self, what in the hell have you done?"" and realize I've just conned myself out of 30$ by being totally brain dead.

But as a final bit of curiosity, the script I'm working quite prominently features- Conmen.

Can I chalk this up as research</i>

We'll all agree I'm a moran of epic proportions, and that i should probably be locked up for my own safety. until then please find my bizarre lapses in judgement entertaining.

Hmm, what else would I want to mention to my one year older self- ""Self, straighten up and flight right, dammit! I know you're just fucking around, get on the goddamned ball already!""

Yeah, that probably sums it up nicely."

"event","Well, I am totally obsessed with Star Wars Galaxies again. Thing is, I got the Space Expansion and it just remade the game for me. Now I enjoy the MMORPGs, but I don't like grinding skills and I usually get bored because that's essentially the only thing most people want to do. Kill Kill Kill, level, become master and then be the biggest badass on the block. For my bloodlust I just play Half Life 2 or Counter-Strike. I'm pretty keen on the FPSs on the odd day and then even the Rogue Squadrons and GTAs on weekends. I enjoy games, I love fiction and I am content in considering ""Play"" a big part of my life and personality.So when it comes to SWG I have a interesting philosophy.

I play the game with a different approach and am, essentially, all about the RP. But the real key to role playing, I think, is subtlety. I don't have to be Luke's cousin or Han Solo's ex girlfriend who's parents were killed by the Empire and must complete my quest to kill Vader or some such craziness. I could be a bartender, or a hair designer, or even a gardener. And if I did it I would do it all the way. I like the idea of the everyday that's happening under the grand things. This is why SWG appealed to me in the first place and the fact that the original Star Wars Universe rocks. If you see me around, I'm probably going to a Cantina, not to grind Entertainer, but to stand around and talk to folks, and tell my Star Wars Stand Up jokes. I have 30 macros dedicated to jokes alone. In comparison I have like three combat macros loaded at any time, so I'm always more ready to throw out a Tarkin or Ewok joke, than to accept a Dual with anyone.

Because of my nongrinding approach, I'm also usually broke. Like at one point I had a house, and loads of clothing and furniture, and even power collectors and flora farms or whatever. But I couldn't pay the upkeep. And I don't even care. Yes, money in the game is nice, it facilitates a lot of things, but I have just as much fun just riding my bike across a planet or talking trash. I don't even have that many POIs logged in my badges. After a year of playing, I still only have about a dozen or so badges. Again, it doesn't bother me.

Another thing that I enjoy quite a bit is my chosen Profession. But you won't find it in a skill tree. I decided early on I wanted to be a Swoop pilot. A racer. Bring back the 50's style pink slip racing. So I monitored the Player sponsered events looking for races all the time. I even found myself Sponsered by a well to do Corperation, who outfited me with bike and gear. (I for one think I look totally snazzy) ABout the time I started really seeking out the races however, they started to slow down. I raced in two, (finished 2nd and 3rd out of some fairly large crowds) and then all the other races I'd registered for fell through. It's sad, cause all I wanted to do was race, talk trash, and have fun, and the only thing I could manage were individual challenges throughout the Galaxy. 1 on 1s were usually not for money, either, so I wasn't making the big creds I'd been hoping to when starting out on my path. 
--And then there were AV21 Landspeeders.

Remember, I'm a deadbeat. So no speeder for me, and no chance at 1 on 1s without a much superior knowledge of terrain, which will only help you so much. To this day I still don't have a speeder, and while I've done my best to clock times at the swoop tracks, I've yet to score a badge, which is pretty pathetic, since I am supposed to be such a hotshot. But everyone has low points in life, and in SWG, it's no different, I'll eventually get back on my game and will probably take on all comers once again, have no fear.

So I can easily find ways to entertain myself, whether it's picking up a few missions, or tinking on my sometimes skill tree'd profession, or whatever, but I never really get good perpetual RP even if I seek out the RP communities. I find you have to ingratiate yourself a bit and for a loner like me, I like hopping all over the place. That makes for a pretty sporadic player, and I haven't got any friends that play anymore, (most aren't really RP inclined anyhow). But I kept my subscription, and pop in every now and again, and still, on the whole, enjoy the game. 

Then came JTL- which I started playing 4 days ago. And it's like two different games in one. I love flying the missions in space. I love the dog fights, finding the lightest most powerful armor and customizing my shields and hell I love launching my Yacht and jump out of the Pilots chair and running all around it to the various rooms. In fact I'm ready to start throwing parties on the Yacht, except for the fact I'm a loner in the game and probably wouldn't have anyone ot throw the party with. 

And yeah, I can appreciate a real life party myself, and I can certainly distinguish between the two, but I find the idea of doing it in game somewhat enthralling. I imagine it's probably the same element that's sold as many copies of ""The Sims"" as it has.

But right now, I'm having so much fun in Orbit, that it's really bringing me back to my ground game. And my enthusiasm, will probably cool eventually, just like everything else. But really, blowing shit up in space is totally fucking bad ass! So yeah, anyone playing, I'm on Eclipse, send me a tell and I'll give you a lift into Orbit, we'll blow some stuff up, it'll be a good time!"

"event","So here's my day after Xmas blog. It's cold as hell! It snowed this morning. We don't get much snow, but we got some today. I woke up to what sounded like water pouring through my ceiling, Turned out it was icy snow on my windows. Nothing looks to have been plowed yet either, which is weird cause it's 11AM. Now if only I had a coffee maker, which i suppose i'll buy next week since i got major gift cards. i was kinda indistinct about what i wanted for xmas, and when asked all i could think of was ""Doc Ock"" stuff, but that resulted in this:

<img src=""http://img158.exs.cx/img158/3856/spideyock5xr.jpg"">

Which is really just an old school scuplt of Otto that's been repackaged. I mean the art on the Box looks like Ultimate, and who know what the aunt thinks since this is the only thing I asked for, because he just looks utterly psychotic.

Also got Jump to Lightspeed which lets me do Space flight combat in Star Wars Galaxies. I'm having a lot of fun. Might need a joystick though, controls take a bit of getting used to. But lots of fun! Also Star Wars themed, got the Lego X Wing. No idea where I'm going to put that. I get a lot of toys for a 25 year old. No skin off my back. I like it that way, s'long as it's not the only stuff i'm getting. Toys rock.

Speaking of 25 year oldedness, well I got about 13 hours or so of that left. Bizarre, all together, bizarre.

I've got a crapload of movies to watch and little time to do it it seems. Tomorrow's my last day off, and I wanted to go shopping. Chocolat has been in the player for a week or so, and after that, I'm going to need a few hours for Return of the King EE. Yep, that's my life. All about the drama of not having time to watch movies. Anyway, between the new computer system, the jewlery my mom made me, and all the other goodies, I had a nice Xmas. Yep, tha's me, all about the stuff. i <3 stuff. Think I'm going to run a few mission in space before I head out for spagetti for lunch. And Cake! I haven't had an appetite for the last few days, though I was getting sick. But I'm definitely up for some cake today.

And to you and yours, I hope you managed to make the holidays work as well. Whether stuffed or not stuffed with toys and loads of crap you will NEVER EVER NEED, I think there's always something to be enjoyed. Even if it is only the time off from work. 

Now I'm much looking forward to New Years!"

"event","As much as i've been enjoying Christmas this year, I find as the day approaches, somethings are really starting to annoy me. here are just a few:

I. Gift buying thought processes- This is probably my least hated thing, in that it really only bothers me occasionally and doesn't prompt any level of deep reflection, but rather just paranoia and disappointment. I try and put a lot of thought into my gifts, cultivating need and want and the amount of use an pleasure whichever individual is going to get from what I ultimately decide on. Budget and availibility come into play, as well as how much I know about a person. No matter how easy I think I am to shop for, (and truly, with as much stuff as I like, and obsess over and talk about, at loud volume levels, I truly should be the easiest person on earth to shop for) I still end up with some things that just really make me go, ""What in the ever loving fuck?!"" I mean here are five things you can go wrong with: movies, anything that has anything to do with movies (books, soundtracks, posters, pictures, figures whatever) music, books, and computers. Now this isn't a hard list, and that almost covers any aspect on any interest I will ever have, for the rest of my existance. Even if you may think that I've seen a movie, or read a book, or whatever, with the amount of pop culture that actually exists, I can't have it all covered. And you don't even have to stick to english if it has subtitles. Just start looking through the lists of oscar winners, or pulitzers of hell the NY Times best sellers. that's a lot of shit i don't have. you can even combine two or more! i would appreciate a moment of consideration as to whether the book or movie you're getting me is any good, though, thanks. and i know i can kind be, hmmm rather vocal if you moronically decided to get me a poodle tapistry or something, but mostly though, family and friends pick up on the obvious. mostly. 

II. Meaningless destruction of property- Okay this struck me last night as I had to brave the Wal-Mart for items (see previous entries for my psychological reaction to Wal-mart) but seriously, I came across a completely ruined Nintendo DS that someone had taken a key to and scratched both screens up horribly, and then, even more HORRIFIC was the decapitated DOC OCK figure that still sat in his packaging in the toy department. Okay you puppy torturing little fucks, as much as mindless destruction is fun, and as much anxiety that Wal-Mart induces in me, these two things just reminded me of the meaningless excess that our society represents. I like my role as mindless consumer a lot, I go around, buying and consuming and getting my kicks and grins for being so ironicly typical and trying to comfort myself by saying it's ironic because at least I know what I happily am. But then at the same time, I hate everything about modern society, consumer culture and the demonic horrors it perpetuates through out the world. I pretty much hate humans altogether on an absolute value basis.

III. Pepsi Spice - Okay Pepsi-co, I have no problem that you're marketing demons found some new way to sell vats of flat pepsi to the teeming masses of morons, but don't fuck with me. If I have to hear that goddamned jingly anathema you call a radio commercial again I'm going to stab some hoors. It's not the evil crass commercialism, because, as I've mentioned, I'm the happy ironic consumer, but you had to go fuck with the Nog. How dare you even begin to perhaps PONDER Pepsi Spice in the same breathe as Eggnog, but to write lyrics deriding that holy, cherished institution of creamy, tasty, goodness is just utterly SICKENING! I feel part of my soul die every single time I'm forced to listen to your propaganda. So fuck you, Pepsi Spice. Fuck you and the donkey that carried you to Nazareth."

but i fucking love eggnog. 

i fucking love it. 

i've had some scary eggnog stories, and if you're dehydrated, and dying of thirst, yeah, nog is not the refreshing, electrolyte replenishing beverage you're really going to want to chug, but i love it.

i usually have a pint in the fridge from Oct to Feb, longer if i can manage to find it, but this year, NONE!

Everytime i have gone to the grocer, i cannot find the nog. i know for a fact that last year food lion was hiding the nog in the veggie cooler for some reason, and having moved, i'm more of a harris teeter goer lately. still the lack of nog is inexcusable. there will be repercussions if i don't get some nog soon.

so that's the crisis du'jour this week, in other news i have an christmas tree. nothing super fabulous, or anything, and it's noticably lopsided, but there are some fun ornaments, and it's an interesting thing for my own apartment. this being the first offically 'mine' tree i've discovered that the tree tradition is weird. it takes up much room, and i can't figure if i'm supposed to leave the lights on all night or if i should turn them off before i go to bed. decorating with bart and mom was kinda surreal, and to be honest going into the living room and seeing the tree is very surreal. even stranger, i'm pretty sure, i'm the only one of my friends who has a tree, greenville, raleigh, whatever. i have a tree and 60 years worth of ornaments. plus my own little personal touches. (i'll take some close ups) but one think i need to pick up this weekend is some pine scent candles or something.

i think i'm going to take some pics and put them up on the journal tonight. i know you're aquiver with excitement."

now as i listen to the greatness, i will share some moments of my week thus far:

work sucks balls. 

Death Cab For Cutie's ""Lightness"" is entirely too appropriate a soundtrack for Abe Sapien. I have finally come to terms with having a thing for Abe Sapien. This is unusual. HB is perpetually the man, and I would lose a weeks pay to shoot pool with him. But I'm all about me some Abe. It's a mystery. Abe, stop messing with my head, man. 

From The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy:
<i>As a boy tries to pull Grim's arm from it's socket</I>
Grim: ""When I turn my hat around, it's like a switch...""

This so KILLS me. It's just consistantly better each and every time I watch it. Likewise with Evil Con Carne, the other Maxwell Atoms show Cartoon Network is very enthusiastic about promoting. They're really stellar, I enjoyed them very much before, but really good, sick, morbid fun. Props.

i am still motherfucking deaf in one ear. this is fucking annoying. but as i tell everyone, i don't have the inclination to waste my sick and leave days or hours, or minutes on going to a doctor. what i really need to  do is go to mexico and get me some drugs otc. what's the deal? mexico and canada, and sandwiched inbetween is a land of prohibition so ludicris it's killing the citizens. 

tom ridge is the next one down. how has this managed to not raise the alarm? John Timor, I promise I'll buy a bike by the end of 2005. my recommendation for everyone is to follow suit. i mean if you really care that much, by next year i may be completely happy to embrace the nuclear holocaust. hey, it strikes me a particularly funny how all the tv shows are 'reality' based these days, a very sort of earmark to natural progression toward that inevitable outcome. we're some pretty stupid fucking mammals.

i've been mentally and emotionally sluggish lately. that also annoys me to the point of felony, but i can't really think of anything to do about it, other than trudge along until the bog ends. it's probably just daylight savings time because i'm not all that terribly complex. except when i'm high, and then i'm motherfucking Feynman.

i will however conceed that i miss school, and i'd rather back doing that than anything at my disposal right now. nothing is too terribly exciting.

i can't actually think of any physical happenings to report. i'm just a work/sleep drone to be honest. with a little bit of HL2 on the side. i mean, come on it's HL2! a weekend of straight playing and no end in sight.

i'm supposed to be looking up fares for vegas. cause fam wants to do vegas in Feb. and i mean i guess i'll go, but i want to go to chicago or visits some friends. not use my vacation days in vegas. i mean gambling and comp booze is good. paying bills and tom jones are, not as such.

so i may just spends my monies on a new camera. i really wanted to do another chicago trip. or you know i could fund that film i'm working on. which is back to my original problem, the sluggishness. if i don't stop eating beef the mad cow may save the problem for me."

The phone is off now unfortunately, but it was sooper fun whiles it lasted.

NCIS was crazy odd last night. I like Gibbs but I thought he was going to be biting people at points. He's smart and distant and somehow reminds me of Otto if he were terribly unfriendly. go figure.

wednesday is Lost, Smallville and other- Other being Law and Order, the Paranormal stuff SciFi shows, (tonight they have video of a ghost!) or if I'm really desperate- CSI: NY, which sucks cock, and I usually won't watch.

tv is about 47% of my brain at any given time. 

reality wise, things have eased up at work after a mad flurry of activity. i'm actually kinda getting my bearings, and working out a new schedual for writing, although the apartment layout leaves a bit to be desired, and I need to figure out how to jack the monitor up or something cause I just can't quite get comfortable. it's getting there though.

greenville (and i'm using that as a metaphorical catch all) is starting to fade from existance, but it's not really doing much on it's own behalf and you know, i'm just about ready to let it go if it wants to go. maine and ny will call me up pretty regular, and i get email from michigan and vancouver regularly as well. i suppose it's all right though, that shit happens, and i really do need to refocus my energies. It's very much coming off to me as the Last episode of Quantum Leap. You ever see that? You know the whole priest convo that goes on between Sam and the Bartender Al at the end? Yeah, I feel like that. That's all right though, it'll be my ""tackling fuel"" for the foosball. (no one can mix a methaphor like me)

so i'm pretty chill and i need to start xmas shopping, got lots of ideas, and even invented a new holiday favorite- Chocolate Eggnog! oh fuck yeah, mofos."

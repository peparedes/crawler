"event","I know I haven't posted in well over a year and most of the people i used to hang out with i now don't. So more than likely no one is reading this and hence there is no pressure. If Lindsay is reading this then I apologize for the myriad of hurtful things I will probably say in this entry. I want to break up with my girl friend. She has become a cold and selfish person and more and more lately I have felt a lack of respect and affection from her. I love her desperately. I don't want to create any misconceptions. I do love her and that is why my life has been hell for the past few months. Now all I have to do is get up the nuts and get ready for what will probably be a very long period of sexlessness. I realize that probably is not a word but it suits its purposes for the time being. Lindsay says that she loves me but I can't help but question that lately. I put it all to her straight. I told her that I was unhappy and was not going to stay in this situation forever. I asked her for a statement of her intentions and feelings and she hasn't even bothered to respond. I think she is under the impression that she can just glide through this shit like she does with everything else in her life, but she is sorely mistaken. I haven't really made up my mind yet. I don't really want to throw a two year relationship out the window, but I know for certain that if things continue the way they do I won't be able to be patient with her anymore. Well if there is anyone out there who actually gives a shit and even looks at this stuff, drop me a line. my new email is bhooper3@mail.usf.edu"

Buried in Smoke

I wonder at times how much of my life can be buried in smoke
My pleasure held in trivial things
A chance encounter, a smell, a taste, a thing I've almost forgotten
Shreds of guitar rhythm and eye colors
Learing at me from behind bullet proof glass

I see the nature of lost spring times
I walk beneath a blanket of lost things
Left overs on my plate
Like tiny fingers running through my hair

These days I fill my head with childhood memories
They plague me in the late hours
When I choke and sputter from darkness
And see the muted brightness of faded light bulbs
My ceiling fan humming a tune that's just out of my grasp

Love is like a shade of green that I can't mix
My life a lost dream
My failures a captured reality

I stare at the swirling universe 
My head on fire with the possibility of new ideas
Churning with a belief 
That the world is a cradle for my developing form"

"event","so i know that its been just a shade shy of a decade since ive posted, but i suppose that theres no time like the present. I should begin by noting that i am completely fed up with my current situation. I am exhausted all the time and allthough i spend so much time trying to help those i care for i never seem to accomplish anything. Maybe im just being a worthless pecimist but i don't really feel like im important to anyone. I hope that any of my friends reading this realize that i love you all. i just hope that every one realizes that even though i may seem like an ass hole some times, i really only have the best intentions. Any who nothing else to report for now. take it sleazy everyone"

"event","more poetry for the kiddys, i hope you enjoy considering that writing brings me only more  sullen thoughts however i must do it so please send me your thoughts on it

Shouting Silently 

I wonder between broken rooms 
Doors sagging on hinges 
The wood bloated and splintered 
Childish glee and open book smiling 
Mills through my head
Like egg shells breaking on a skillet edge
Cigarette smoke wafts up to meet with dust caked ceiling fans
Making beer add lights look like chimneys
As the spill luminescence onto my concentration
Boiling water into a chipped mug

Lonely faced strangers pass by pretending confidence
Liars in the most paltry game
We are all alone 
Forced to build a refuge in the mind
Hiding from hand me down adulteries 
Afraid to face the chill without something to cover us

Puling pedestrians prattle on about common knowledge occurrences 
Smoking their smoke
Drinking their drink
Hoping they will chance on answers
Without even asking questions
Enraptured in flower pot memories
And noodle salad daydreams
Treating each other as opponents 
With no competition to compete in

Sandwiched between faith and despair
I reach my hands up 
Hoping the rain will cleanse them of their stains"

"event","what is the point in work? i think that it is all a big scheme to lead us away from joy peace and prosperity. work is a scam. we have to face this fact if we are ever going to move anywhere in the world. i for one am perfectly content to live with my parents well into my mid fourties. what else do i have to live for? at least if i mooch off my parents until im in the heart attack range i can live like a king and die without a care. most would say that this plan is lunacy but several aspects of my life have to be combed through before such a brash assumption is made. 

for starters there are many things about my life that are glorified by my friends but are actually curses. foremost is my artistic abilities. sure its great to be able to do what i can do but to what end? art doesn't cure most of the things that suck about my life, its just a pass time. and the person who cares about it the least is me. family life is good: married parents, beloved brother and sister, but what really is the point? love can be as nauseating as hate and im stuffed out my ass with peoples opinions when they don't really know what happens in the inner hooper circle. It really boils down to this my life sucks ass and something must change. 

heres the point. work is for suckers. although i am a sucker, i will no longer be sucked into the deceptive promises of work. being carless is a bitch but so is life and this job is only getting me down. so my plan is and i hope many will follow in my foot steps, stay at home until my life is nearly over and never work again. become obese and start spending more time with my computer than with the sun. this i think is the easiest answer. after all what is so great about ""conventional"" work filled living that can't be replaced with freeloading over-excess and gluttony? so that is all for today im am now going to wallow in my own self loathing"

"event","although this post doesn't matter because i don't have any friends to read it in the first place here i am posting. My life is strewn with large ammounts of useless information. i shall not dive in any of it tonight. i would prefer to mull through this evening withought getting anything personal on the table. besides, im in a fairly good mood. im going out of town on sunday. that should be interesting if nothing else. besides i get to escape from joe's homoerotic antics for a couple of weeks. anything that does not involve a sweaty red headed homo will be a welcome change of pace. by the way joe if you are reading this, YOU ARE A DISGUSTING BEAST!!!!!..........and i love ya buddy. regardless of how sad this post may be i must now leave off because it is late and i am tired of typing."

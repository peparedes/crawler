 i used to LOVEEE this show.. locker 47, i think it was.. or some other number.. i cant remember. that was my favorite one. but the one that scared me the mose was the leprachaun one.. that scared the shit out of me.. or the one with the doll house, only cause i had a doll house that looked like that one, and i was always afraid i was going to get sucked into it. but, the throwing the sand on the fire.. that never did work for me! god i always wanted to be apart of the midnight society!

 im fucking wasted. i have my eyes closed, cause everythings spinning ,, so if anything is spelled wrong.. thats why. kyle.. AKA my home dog bought me alot of drinks tonight, and i spent alot of money on shots. . i had a blast. HAPPY BIRTHDAY STEPHANIE.. yes!!! 21!!!!! we dreank, we danced, we laugheed. it was great. septembers is the place to be, if you want a good laugh, cause i had a few of those tonight. ive never seen steph drunk before.. but tonight was a sight for us all. it was wonderful! =o)

 . wow.. im drunk. i dont think ive ever written a drunk entry before. i guess theres a first time for everything. there was this girl tonight, wearing a red tank top with white fur around the edges.. kinda like santa.. it looked so beyond retarded.. but adam miley wanted to be all up on that. ""santas daughter amber.. that aint no santa"" HA... he wanted that right under his tree.. silly fuck. 

 boof was there in spirit.. "" THATS WHATS UP"" wow.. i love that girl.. she makes me laugh so damn much.. hahahaha wow. great times with her.. shout out to courtney sexton!.. even though she cant read this. i know missy can, so miss report this back to steph, who can report it back to boof. =o) thanks baby cakes!  

yeah, i dont know hwy i just wrote that.. i should just delete that.. i think i am.. hold on.. haha ok there.well,  now you can all sit and wonder what i just wrote about and erased. Miss Stephanie Sexton knows exactly what i just wrote. she needs to get a fucking user name, so i can add her ass to my friends list so she can read this shit. 

 on the way home tonight.. i ALMOST jumped out of the car when we were on some street. that would have been horrible. i dont know what over came me at the particular moment.. but, i should have been shot for it.. haha sorry steph, and missy and jacob avrum. 

 i should probably go now. how good is my typing with my eyes closed? is it somewhat decent? does it show that i sit online for about 19 hours out of the day?.. does it show how much of a fucking loser bitch that i really am?.. 

 i think i may make this public so everyone can read this shit. yeah.. i might. i see hwo tries to read this. that im chaos thing is pretty handy. so HI to all the people who try.. but, im letting you fucks read this. and plus.. i feel bad for stephy who cant.. haha its all good  steph.. its ALLLLLLLL good.  THATS WHAT UP. "" when he has that beard"".. haha funniest story of the night.. by far. 

 much love to all my friends.. peace out to brooklyn.

"event","all day yesterday my stomach has hurt soo bad. i havent really been eating that great, cause it hurts.. and then it will stop and i'll be starving.so i eat, and ohh what do you know.. i feel like im dying again. so i woke up this morning.. felt like complete shit.. but went to work anyways. that lasted for about an hour before i told yelena i needed to go home.  so here i am.. at 9:55 in the morning.. sitting in my igloo of a house. i think im just gonna lay in bed and watch sappy movies all day. sounds like a plan to me. 


 got in a huge fight with my mom on the phone last night. seriously, i felt like getting in my car, going over her house and beating her up. she called for my dad.. but he was on his cell phone in the other room.. so i said hed call her back when he got off the phone. about 5 minutes later, the phone rings again.. its her. ""just let dad answer... that way he'll get off the phone""... and i told her that was gay... he'll call her back in a minute. so about 10 mins go by.. she calls YET AGAIN... now im getting pissed. im trying to watch my shows... and shes being a bitch about it. i keep going out to tell my dad... and he said he was almost done.. to tell her he'll call her in a few minutes. well that doesnt stop her... now she starts calling my cell phone. about 10 times.... then she calls the house again, and i dont answer, and neither does my dad cause by the time he got up, to answer it... she hung up. there goes my cell again.. "" WHY DIDNT YOU ANSWER THE PHONE"".... ummm you told me not to... and you let it ring 3 times and hung up, dad didnt even have a chance to get 2 feet away from the couch. 

 so now we're both screaming.. and she hangs up on me. great.... .3 seconds later big surprise... the phone again. "" what""... i say... "" wheres dad""... same old shit... i started screaming that he was still on the phone and that he would call her in a minute,, where she then starts yelling "" I DIDNT KNOW HE WAS ON THE PHONE"" ... HAHAHAH WHAT THE FUCKKKKK... i told her about 90 times that he was. go smoke some more crack mom... jesus christ.


 

 on saturday night the girls,, (maris, miss, manda and meg) came over to hang out. we went downstairs and played catch phrase. is that not the greatest game in the entire world?! i love it. its like.. you sit down to play, and youre excited... but not alll that excited. but then you start playing and youre screaming and flipping out. haha i was dying. i almost peed my pants laughing sooo unbelievably hard sometimes. it was great. then we're sitting there, and my dads in teh other room getting IM'ed from someone.. and marissa busts out laughing. shes laughing so hard,, that shes laying on the floor convulsing (sp?)  haha it was great. 

 so after they left, i brought maris (the ritz) home... and headed over the delgrecos to house sit/dog sit. marissa, the little girl, has a trampoline in the back yard.. so i was laying on that, looking up at the stars. it was soo beautiful out that night. it wasnt cold at all... not really that warm.. but just right. so im laying there, looking at the stars, and the sky was soo soo clear. you could see all the stars, the moon.. and tiny streaks of white.. it was awesome. so im laying there like a sap... smiling to myself, and i see a shooting star. how perfect is that?!? i felt like i was in a movie. so i closed my eyes and made a wish. 

 things have a funny way of working themselves out.. soooo maybe it will come true, but its me... so who knows. 


 In other news... im using the 40 dollars they left me for food money to go tanning.. because i look like death run over.. its gross. i dont want to be summer tan... just healthy tan. im sick of looking like a ghost. 


 well.. i think thats enough for today. im sorry to the 4 people that actually read this.... it was long, and quite boring. 
 

 time to go put my pjs on, curl up in bed and watch.. hmmmm maybe '16 candles'... i havent seen that in a long time "" I <3 Jake Ryan!"" haha 

  and maybe after that a little breakfast club. Awesome 80s at Amber's today!! =o)"

WHAT UP!? haha.. so we're sitting,, drinking.. having a GRAND ol time.. when i hear from my friends.. 

 "" oh my god.. uhhh oh my god""... so being a nosey bitch.. i turn around. BAM. i almost had a heart attack. my heart was beating so damn fast.. i thought it was going to come out of my chest. ""Brandons here amb... oh my god.. "" haha thats all i hear. and thats all i see.. but, it was his brother Joey. so im in the clear. nope.. wrong. now i see brandon.. and he walks RIGHT the fuck by me... brushes up against me, and keeps walking. ummmmm now im ready to throw up. 

 so what do i do?.. the best thing i can.. i run my ass right up to that bar about 90 more times.. so now im trashed... and who walks in next?.. jake, adam , brett, adam and MISSSSAAAAYY!! i jumped on all of them. haha i was so happy to see them.
 
 OH.. i almost forgot. when i went to paddys.. up in R.I.. and we met those guys, remember?,, the ones we went to the casino with.. yeah, they were there.. minus the coke head. they remembered us, cause i went up and was flipping out. hahaha yeah, you know ive had a little too much, when i walk up to people asking if they remember me. anyways.. we hung out with them for a little while. 

 so.. now i have about 15 drinks in me.. im good to go. so i walk my ass outside... walk up to brandon and say "" hey... whats up""

 so that started a conversation. one i never thought would ever be happening again. i dont know.. it was just kinda strange. cause i didnt know how to feel or act, or what to say. well.. i knew how i had planned to do all those things.. it just didnt happen that way. 

 after awhile talking to him.... my ride was leaving. so i said bye to my rhode island boys... walked in teh door and what song is pkaying? bon jovi.. livin on a prayer.. i LOVE him.. and that song. so im singing away.. being pulled out of the bar. fun times... fun times. 


 so i went home.. talked to my cousin chris for a little while on the phone.. and then i went to bed.. great night overall with my friends. i love them all so much, thanks for looking out for me. even if i dont show it the normal way =o)

"event","so its thursday already. does anyone else feel like time is just flying by??... i know i say this all the time, but its so much different being older. i remember when i was little, it seemed like years between halloween and christmas. it just took forever to get here. and now, im dreading it. i have no money at all... haha its going to suck this year, im sorry guys =o(... oh well.. hope you like youre cards!


 lets see.. nothing else has really happened. i cleaned my room today. its forever messy. well, not really.. but im a very organized person, so when things are moved i feel like a bomb went off in my room. if my bed isnt made.. forget it. soooo i just spend about 30 minutes picking things up, putting things back, throwing stuff out.. and making my bed. 

 blaze is doing good.. my fish, for everyone that doesnt remember. i think, he still thinks he might be a dolphin. he swims like crazy,, all around his little bowl. i almost killed him the other day by accident, when i dropped him in the sink and he started flopping all around, i thought he was going to go down the drain. my poor baby, but hes ok! and i just wanted to say thanks to my dad for standing there laughing at me, while i was flipping out.


 anyways... 


 i really dont want to go back to work, im beyond over-tired.. i just want to go bed and not wake up for a very long time. kinda like sleeping beauty. ohh man, how great would that be. haha id be waiting a god damn long ass time for a prince to come kiss me to wake me up though. soo maybe not such a good idea. hmm.. oh well


 did it get cold fast,,, or what?. yeah yeah yeah.. i know, i complain about it being cold or me being cold ALL the time, when in actuality, its pretty nice out. but, now.. its cold. its starting to feel like winter every day now. its soooo cold in the morning when i leave for work, and standing outside on the playground is torture. 

 and oh, i dont know.. maybe the fact that my AC is still in my window... might have something to do with the fact that i sit here frozen whenever im online.. which means im cold all the time, because anyone that knows me,, knows where i am when im home. 


 plans for this weekened.. and upcoming week?... house sitting for the DelGrecos. theyre going to florida saturday to saturday, so im staying there, taking care of the dogs.. and lounging around. it'll be nice to get out of my house for a little while.. even though i'll be scared staying there.. haha like i always am, oh well... its money, and im broke.. so whatever. 

 well i think ive talked enough about nothing.. sorry! =o) 

 back to work for me... to go see my ghetto fab kids. adios

"event","so.. last night i headed up to southington with maris to go to jays house for a halloween party. got a little lost on the way,, but we made it there in one piece. 

 i dressed up like pippi longstocking.. and it was HOT... but, no one knew who the fuck pippi was?! UMM HELLO.. didnt you watch that movie growing up?!!! deprived much?!!!!

 anyways, maris was a witch nikki b was a cat, chris was a mailman, scott a yankees fan, stef a slut becca a vampire, and jay wore his slyvester the cat costume for about .5 because he said it was so hot that he felt like he had a zip lock bag around his nuts.. soo he took that off. 

 i wont ""best costume"" yayy!! everyone voted for me!! =o) jay had this smoke machine.. fog machine thing,,, whatever it was. and all us girls were dancing in the living room and the fog was soo thick that you couldnt see anything at all. i think there was something in the fog.. cause i felt like i was on crack. nicole... haha dropped to the ground and starts SCREAMING "" STOP DROP AND ROLLLLLLL"" the next thing i know her and stef are rolling around the living room. i almost peed my pants, i was laughing so hard. it was great. so after that... me nicole and bec went outside to get some air. this kid, Todd.. ended up coming outside, and the girls left me.. so im sitting outside with this guy for about 40 minutes. we were just talking.. but mike inside starts screaming that me and todd are "" macking it"" so everyone runs to the windows to look. UM NEGATIVE. he was so wasted that the kids asking me the same questions about 30 times. i just sat there and laughed it off.. and answered the same everytime i was asked. crazy fuck. hmm lets see.. what else. he told me that my barretts were the highlight of my outfit..( they held on the coat hanger for my hair) cause... ""girls that wear those are hot... its so awesome when i girl wears those things"" umm.. i was about to take them off and ask if he would like to try them on.. 


 so after i was frozen.. we went inside. i accidentally sat on the dog.. oops and then i got my prize from Becca.. a pumpkin reflector,, to wear around my neck... where i had a kid tell me "" why dont you go run in the street... to see if it works"" yeah, thanks alot asshole!!! 

 UM chris.. ok.. haha a little strange last night. pulling maris into the bathroom.. almost touching 900 volts of electricity that jay had made this ""jacobs ladder"" thing with.. all up on me and marissa in a picture we took.. grabbing his ""over night delivery""... yeah.. ok then. 

 what else happened. everyone was WASTED.. and since i was driving i didnt drink at all. so it was wierd to sit there and watch everyone going crazo. it was fun though. i watched ghost ship with maris and scott.. cause the 3 of us were the only ones not drinking. yeah.. oh well. 

 but, overall.. very very very fun night with my friends =o) we should be having a ""girls night"" at marissas very soon! 


 oh... and i KNEW when becca busted out the sambucca last night.. (AKA.. the devil) it was going to be a bad bad night for her.... we left, and she was in the bathroom.. poor baby girl! 

 anyways.. Happy Halloween you guys, be safe.. dress up... have fun!!!"

 on saturday, me, maris and her mom went to Toys R Us... you know, to look around. And i just had to buy it. i bought the cutest most adorable cabbage patch doll! Her name is Audrey, and she has the cutest little face, and the twisty braid things in pig tails, on each side of her head. she kinda has reddish brown hair, and pretty gray eyes... and i love her. yeah, so what.. i spent 30 dollars on a doll. but it reminded me sooo much of when i was a little girl. i loved my babies soo soo much... and buying her made me happy. =o)


 then.. we had to go to A.C. Moore.... and they had these bear sweaters on sale... you know those craft bears that people make.. and dress up, yeah those. anyways.. they were on sale for a dollar.. sooooooo i bought one for each season.. yeah i know, im gay.. but its cute! she sits on my bed.. wearing her festive mini sweaters. 

 hey.. i have a lot of time on my hands.. its makes me happy dressing up a baby,, thank god its only a doll!


 anyways.. nothing new on the homefront... oh, except for the fact that i went to the gym tonight for the first time in a few weeks... well, more like a month... and, i feel like i may die if i move the wrong way.. yeah.. way to go amber.

I'm so excited that one of my friends is going to have a baby!! =o) Yay!! as long as its not me.. im happy =o) got home from that around 1230 or so and i was wide the fuck awake..there was no one online... nothing to do, nothing on tv... i was beyond bored.. it sucked.  so after sitting in my room doing nothing forever... i ended up hanging out with jeff. fun times.. =o)

 i woke up at the crack of dawn the next day.. well 11. but still thats early. i didnt really do much on sunday.. just bummed around. 

 on monday we went to a play at the garde. it was so much fun. i think i enjoyed it more than the kids did. it was great. i saw my babies lauren and haley.. and theyre screaming "" MISSSSSSSSSS AMMMMMBERRRRRRRR..... WE LOVE YOU"" my heart... broke. i miss them soo sooo much. i told lauren to tell her mom to call me soon.

"event","haha.. thats what i learned today.

 my kindergarten and first grade and marissas first grade class walked our asses allllllll the way from the magnet school to the fire station on bank street. um... yeah, and who got stuck holding the stop sign in the middle of the road so all the kids could cross? THATS RIGHT.. me.. haha 

 anyways, we got there, the firemen were on a call. so we sat there and sang songs. our teachers looked like assholes, doing little dances and singing crazooooo songs. i sat on the ground with kids on my lap.. 

 we went upstairs and watched sesame street goes to the firehouse, while we waited for them.. UMMMMM it was great. me and maris were sitting there smiling soooooooooo much.. i missed elmo! then.. in walked jeffrey. um.. he was hot. and i got all nervous and started laughing,, and marissas staring him down. and hes standing right in front of me. yup.. nice view there. haha so we're both laughing like little girls.. it was fun. and as we're going down the stairs, tricia says to me.. (the first grade teach).. ""ooh amb.. did you see him.. me and kathy think you should go for it.. just go up and talk to him .. "" UMM HAHAH HELLO.. obviously they do NOT know me well enough yet. anyyyyways... 
that was my morning... hanging out with hot firemen.. sorry let me rephrase that.. hanging out with a hot fireman... because everyone else was old... i mean.. it is just me??.. or does a guy look 900 times better when theyre wearing a uniform.. i wonder why. whats the appeal?  hmm.. i dont know, but it works

 well.. im off to watch the yankees suck some ass some more. im getting SO mad watching this. do i usally yell at my tv.. well other for my tv shows that i would live and die for ( ie: the OC.. one tree hill).. well the answer is no.. and im sitting here screaming. AND JETER.. what the FUCK.. could you miss that ball any worse than you did?!!? im still mad about mr. a-rod's little ""temper tantrum-little boy swat"" he tried to get away with last night. wit they way theyve been playing these last few games.. they deserve to lose. at least boston is trying hard to get what they want. 

 ok.. this red sox man.. whats his name.. hold on, Johnny Damon... he looks like a cartoon sketch of the big indians in pre-historic little kid movies, like Ice Age.. he looks like ""early man"".. haha it makes me laugh everytime. yeah i know.. im wierd. 

 oh well.. im off to talk to my cousin Krissy some more, so she can ask me "" are you ready for this jelly.."" shes crazy!

"event","so thursday, started off like any other.. pretty damn boring. worked all day, til 530.same ol shit. 

 marissa was subbing so i went down there and helped her out for a little bit. then continued on with my day. had a meeting about my cooking ""enrichment"" class. it should be pretty fun. im getting paid 12 dollars an hour to make cookies.. sooo hey, whatever. 

 thursday night around 630.. kaitlyn called me with the best news in the world. im going to have a little baby nephew. HOW PRECIOUS IS HE GOING TO BE?!!!?? hes going to be the cutest baby boy in the entire world. and i cannot WAIT to see him.. little Jack.. wow.. i love him already!! CONGRATS BEN AND KAIT! love you both!

 then me maris and nikki b went to stashs to see the ""men of playgirl"".. i think they forgot to add to the sign "" RETIRED men of playgirl"".. cause they were OLD.. NASTY FUCKS. i mean, they were really gross. i was getting nausous just looking at them. this one guy, ""the latin lover"" was pushing 55.. and he was from spain, couldnt speak english.. and he was gross. then there was some ""urban cowboy from texas""... with his LONG nasty greasy hair, that hed take out and whip around and get it all over the place. then there was the midget and his ""fire"" that i thought was going to set the place on fire. the bouncer did NOT like that.. i thought he was going to beat up the oldies. 

 so im sitting there watching all this happen.. and laughing, it was pretty funny. 

 so then theres the guy who resembled josh cascio alot. he looked soo much like him. it was crazy. so now theyre walking around in the crowd of all 30 people that were there.. yeah... it was PACKED..( YEAHHH RIGHT).. and the nasty greasy man.. AKA the cowboy, pulls nicoles chair around and starts grinding up against her. me and marissa were DYING. i almost, ALMOST pissed my pants. i was laughing so hard.. but at the same time, praying harder than i ever have.. that he wouldnt come over to me. he jumped the railing behind us, onto the next table, and started macking it with all the old woman there... and i thought for sure he was going to get me next... i was scared, but then i thanked my lucky stars that he did not do that! someone, somewhere was looking out for me. 

 but.... it didnt save maris. cause he went right up behind her, grabbed her boobs and started going to town. they were going everywhere.. and i lost it. i could not stop laughing.. cause the look on her face, was the craziest thing. hahaha it was so funny. he takes her hands and starts making them rub him all over. after he leaves..... she starts gagging.. her hands, and her shirt smelled like B.O... SOOOOOO BAD. i told her not to move, cause everytime she did, the wind would waft over the stench towards me, and id get sick.. 

 so now, i start to feel awful. i feel like i may die at any second. i was BLAZING hot.. and then id get freezing. what the fuck was up with that?!.. so we left,, cause the men were just nasty... nasty people.. men of playgirl?.. no.. men of the gutter? yes. biggest waste of 13 dollars ive ever spent. 

 so we're leaving.. and i start to get sicker. where i then throw up in my mouth. yup.. i need to get home... pronto. as im up in QH dropping maris off and nicole off at her car, we see an accident. i stopped to see if they were ok, they were.. ricky rowe and lindsey kane were there before we were. so they took care of everyting.. they said jackie vandonbosh(sp??)  was ok,, she was in the accident.. so then i left to go home, to contiune to think i was on my death bed. 

 i get home.. take my temp, realize i have one,, take meds.. and lay in the bathroom for about 20 minutes. i was soooo soo cold. i felt like i was naked in antartica or something.. i just couldnt get warm. it was like around 11.. i get my pjs on,socks, a sweatshirt.. get into bed under the covers and wrap a fleece blanket around my head. i guess i didnt close my door, cause my dad kept asking if i was ok, so i just left it open, so i wouldnt hear him knocking. i passed the fuck out. my temp is normally like 96.. it always has been. and last night it was around 100. it never usually even breaks past 98.6.. the regular of what its suppose to be. so im flipping the fuck out, my moms not there to ""take care of me"".. my dad doesnt know what hes doing.. so i do it myself. haha it was kinda sad. but i figured im 21.. its about time i took care of myself when i was sick. first time for everything i supppose. 

 yup.. so sleeping in bed by 11.. i havent gone to bed that early since middle school. it was pretty wierd. i woke up at 530 this morning DRIPPING. i was sweating so much, it was gross. i guess my fever broke... it was nasty. so i got up and changed and went back to bed. when i woke up to go to work at 830.. i felt 150 times better. i still feel fine now. its wierd.. i dont know what it was. but i did NOT feel good. 

 

   i went over aims tonight and hung out with her, ben and kait. it was nice. i saw pics of ""bun"" he is so adorable already. him and his little ""thumb"" haha we ordered pizza.. sat at the table, and talked for a long time. the PARRRTAYYY moved into kaits room while we watched kait trying to play some crazy ass games. ben leaves soon. and im going to be very sad for kaitlyn. shes the strongest person i know.. cause i know i, could never handle that.. id be a complete mess. shes holding it together pretty well, considering everything.. its just very sad. and i give her all my support in anything and everything she needs.. always =o) 

 i ""hugged"" bun tonight.. haha wow.. i love him sooo much!! i cannot wait for that child to be born. 

 after we hung out with the donovans.. me and aim went out to foxwoods to check out hard rock. it was dead. but, we went in anyways.. got a few drinks... talked, caught up on each others lives.. it was nice.

 its nice to know that someone youve known for your entire life will always be there to pick up in a conversation just like that. like not one day has passed. 16 years we've been friends. thats just crazy. so anyways.. we hung out there for awhile... and then we left. it was shitty out tonight, crazzy fucking truck drivers on the highway. i hate them... but, now im home... doing nothing, listening to the rain hit my window.. and listening to music. my ""mellow"" play list. all these songs calm me down sooo much,, after a hectic day. i LOVE how music can do that. i mean,, yeah, some of these songs make me cry.. but whatever.. it doesnt take much. 

 well.... i think thats it for now. pretty boring, i know. im sorry..... thats my life.. take it or leave it

 anyways.. im gonna go read some away messages some more, because im addicted. 

 take care... sleep tight, sweet dreams. ""i'll catch you on the flip side!"" =o)"

"event","yup.. 2 am.. cant sleep, once again. i always take these afternoon naps when i get home at 130.. and it messes up my entire night. oh well.. maybe i'll learn someday. 

 i went to walmart with my dad tonight and we got a cool new phone for the kitchen. it has this talking caller ID thing. we played with that for about 40 minutes.. calling the house with our cell phones so we could hear the thing talk like E.T... it was great. 

 then.. i sat right here on my ass for the rest of the night. Aaron sent me the greatest thing. mash online. soo i played that for awhile... and then got sick of it, cause they forgot the ""pet"" section. whatever. 

 took my keyboard apart tonight... thought it was a smart idea.. you know, to clean it. UM wrong. i couldnt get it back together.. everything was falling out of it, i had people iming me.. and i couldnt answer. it was just a huge mess. and if anyone knows me... i was flipping out, cause this thing is my life. 

 nothing else really.. guess i'll just complain some more since its probably the best thing i can do.

 seriously, im not tired at all. i get the worst case of insomnia sometimes. its awful. dont you hate that?!! when you lay in bed... cant fall asleep and everytime you look at the clok, you think its hours later, when im reality its only been 2 minutes since the last time you looked. i HATE that. 

 i was going through the kitchen drawer earlier tonight, looking for a screwdriver, and i found Trappers old collar. it was SO SAD. i almost bust out crying right there.. it was awful

 well.. heres some quotes from work today....

 Charee ( reading a book during story time)... "" Are you my mother?,, by p.diddy"".. haha it was written by some guy named P.D.. something... i was DYING

 all the kids in line as a bee dive bombed me today.. "" DANNNNGGGGGG miss amber,... yous gots a bee in your hair""

 Demitrios: yo amber... if i was older would you date me?.... 

 Me:   No.....

 Demitrios:... well if i were older.. and maybe a little cuter, would you date me then?... 

 Me.. haha um,, sure demitrios.. 

 

 i dont think anything else happened today really.. im sure something else will happen tomorrow with all those ghetto kids.. anyways, 

 im gonna go watch tv.. or something. try and fall asleep.. hope it works.

"event","so, im bored. i know.. i know. most of you hear that ALL the time.. well, like 3 people, cause, thats all i talk to. sometimes 4.. but hey, whos counting?!... anyways..


      ha.. i dont even know what to write. im kinda tired, im bored.. and knowing that i have to go to the gym soon... makes me want to hide under my bed. 

 speaking of my bed. i wish i could re arrange my room. but.. its been every way possible.. and i dont know where i would put all this shit in here now. i seriously have so much crap in here. my bed, nightstand, dresser, desk, entertainment stand, my dvds, pictures, albums, a stupid laundry basket that i have yet to put clothes away.. and pillows that go on my bed, when i decide to make it. yup.. im a lazy ass.  yeah, i dont know why i just wrote all that.. im SURE you didnt need to know whats in my room.. or really care. but, oh well. like i said before, im bored.. i dont know what to type, so who knows what im going to talk about. lets see..

  work has been going good. its alot better than carelot ever was. i have to go into work tomorrow at like 730.. and work til 530, its going to suck, but i need the money, so whatever. its starting to get really cold out.. which means... snow soon i bet. i hope its nothing like it was last year, cause that sucked ass. i like playing in it.. pretending that im 6 again.. but driving in it.. i hate it. but... i usually end up doing it, cause i hate being trapped in my house. last year it was blizzard 900 and me and maris went to walmart.. yeah, we were retarded and almost died about 30 times.. but it was better than being stuck inside my house. 

 my dads finally home from the hospital( yayy) i missed him soo sooo much. its nice having him home again. i hated being alone in my house all the time. my mom just came over a little while ago, and big surprise.. we got into another fight. i cant even hold a 10 minute conversation with her before one of us gets pissed off. oh well. she usually gets over it. 

 my fish, Blaze.. hes doing good. hes so lively.. always swimming around. hes great to watch. i call him ""puppy"", i dont know why i do that with EVERYTHING that i think is cute.. i have problems. if i see a cute baby.. ""ohhh HIIII PUPPY!"" yeah.. just ignore it. most people do.

 im going to new york on monday cause i have work off for columbus day. me maris and colleen are going. my moms trying to get the day off. shes not sure yet if she can go. we'll see. 

 i watched ""the rookie"" last night. its a wicked good movie, and it always makes me cry. its soo good.. and makes me so happy. its great!

 OH MAN... last night, i watched this show called ""renovate my family"" and it was about this family whos house burned down in april.. and the show came on and they rebuilt them an entire house, and gave them everything they lost. and they gave the kids all this shit. a new riding arena for the oldest girl and her horses, a batting cage and meet the braves visit for the boy and a new puppy cause hers died in the fire to the little girl. i was SOBBING. they were crying cause they were sad they everything they loved and cherished was lost in the fire, and then they were crying cause they were so happy everything was being rebuilt. it gave me chills. i was laying in bed hugging cuddles so tight. haha he always makes it better somehow. 

 seriously,, that bear. if i could take one thing with me.. if my house was on fire.. thats what i would take. without any doubt in my mind. if i could only save one thing, Cuddles... it'd be you. my dad gave it to me when i was in 3rd or 4th grade. and its been everywhere and back with me. ireland, punta cana, across the country this summer, disney trips, sleep overs, camping.. my dad said cuddles has been more places than him. i love that bear more than anything. oh man! ""everything in life i share.. exept of course my teddy bear"" or... ""here sits my teddy bear all tattered and torn. everybody loved him even though hes so worn. his body is floppy his hair is a mess but i love him dearly and he loves me best"".. =o) how perfect are those?!!!




 ** if you could only save one thing that you own.. the most treasured, most loved, non-replacable item in your possesion.. what would it be? and why?... i want to hear what everyone has to say. 

 well.. i think this entry is pointless enough.. soo.. leave a comment, and let us know about the thing i just talked about! =o)

 hope everyone is good. and even if i havent talked to you in awhile.. doesnt mean i still dont think about you =o) take care..

"event","so thats me... good and friendly.. nice! ususally i come off as a bitch, but oh well. 


 so.. im just sitting here, watching Leno, talking to Colleen... you know, my second mom.. =o) (MUCH LOVE) 

 so.. quick update on my life.... 


 i started my new job last monday.. and i really like it. its something completely new... no more cleaning floors, or scrubbing toilets, no changing diapers.. or potty training, OR wiping butts.... im done. and its the biggest weight lifted off my shoulders. some of the people i work with are tapped (... cinderella... yeah, thats her real name... ) 

 the kids there.. i LOVE them! theyre so ghetto. really. this one girl, Charee.. she is me and marissas ""homegirl"" she calls us 'A' and 'M'... and she makes us call her 'C'its great. she told me today, after i tried correcting her when she said "" you know how i do"".... she said ""DANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG A... you dont know how to speak my language""... haha shes 6 years old. it cracks me up!

 in other news... my dad was admitted to the hospital yesterday. i woke up monday morning to my cell phone ringing, and it was my dad, calling me from his cell phone.. in his room asking me to get him a drink cause he couldnt get out of bed. UMMM.. so i ran in there, and his knee was soo swollen. it looked like someone had beaten him with a bat. he had been to the doctors 2 times the week before, and they told him they thought it was lyme disease. UMMM BULLSHIT. cause you should have seen it. it was so gross, and i felt so bad. when i had called to check up on him later in the day.. it sounded like he was dying. so i called my mom and she went over to check on him. she ended up bringing him to the walk in clinic.. and they didnt know what was wrong, so they sent him to a specialist in new london... the one my brother has been to about 3 million times for when he broke everything from his leg to his back.. yeah, so they knew my parents. anyways.. they didnt know what was wrong either.. so they sent him to L&M... where they admitted him. my poor dad! =o( 

 we went to go see him last night, and it was so sad seeing him just laying there,,, not moving. =o( but i ended up lightening up the moment when i busted out laughing as he moved his legs off the bed and i saw these little baby blue non-skid booties on his feet. i almost died laughing. ive never seen my dad is socks that short before,, it was great. 

 me and maris went back to visit him today during out break before our second half of the day. there was another guy in the room... that my dad was in, and me being a nosey bitch, wanted to know what was going on. so im listening and i hear him say to the nurse and dr... "" ok, i just need to pee.."" so im thinking ok... they'll bring him to the bathroom.. um wrong. they hand him this mini urinal/bottle thing. sooo now im like.. OKKKKKKKK... as i hear him pissing in this thing. ok,, its natural... but i dont need to see it. the nurse places it RIGHT there on the table.. for all to see. and its dark brown.. NICE.. so of course, me acting like in 2.. start cracking up. the fucking thing is more than half full.. damnnnnn hold it long enough?! so then i start hearing this noise.. like a fish tank. and i ask my dad if people are allowed to bring pets.. cause it sounds like he brought his fishies.. so now im dying laughing.. my dads telling me to stop.. and marissas hitting me.. whatttt?? i was just trying to lighten the mood.. hhaha.. oh well. guess im the only one that liked that joke.. i still dont know what that noise was. 

 the needle that was waiting to drain my dads knee was just sitting there on the table, and that fucker was huge. i would NOT let that thing near me.. unless i was knocked out. 

 so my dads in there until further notice they said. they wont release him until the infection is gone. hes suppose to leave for japan on saturday for 2 weeks. milstone is sending him there to inspect some nuclear head or something in the power plant over there. he'll be upset if he doesnt get to go.  

 lets see.... what else has been going on??...... nothing too much. ive had my dads truck these past 2 days cause well.. my tire popped, and then we had to bring it up to mystic cause the parts FINALLY came in.. soo,, the beast has been providing me nice rides to work in the morning.. and wicked fun times trying to park in lovely parking lots.. 

 ive been taking care of my dog since my dads been ""off his feet""... sooo he watched tv with me up on my bed tonight. it was fun. sometimes i treat him like i would a brother or something.. is that sad?? i wish i had a baby brother or sister.. that would be wicked fun.. guess i'll have bun for that soon =o) not my bun!!... kaits bun! haha shit. 

 anyways, im bored.. its midnight and im wide awake.. fun times."

Album : Take It All Away 


I won't talk
I won't breathe
I won't move till you finally see
that you belong with me

you might think
I don't look
but deep inside in the corner of my mind
I'm attatched to you
mmmm

I'm weak
it's true
cause I'm afraid to know the answer
do you want me too?
cause my heart keeps falling faster

[chorus]
I've waited all my life to cross this line 
to the only thing thats true
so I will not hide
i'ts time to try anything to be with you
all my life I've waited
this is true

you don't know
what you do
everytime you walk into the room
I'm afraid to move

I'm weak
it's true
I'm just scared to know the ending
do you see me too?
do you even know you met me

[Chorus]
I've waited all my life to cross this line

"event","what an exciting day!! 

 after i slept forever.... i woke up and started to get ready for Kaits wedding! i couldnt believe, i was getting ready to go watch a person ive known forever.. walk down the aisle. it was crazy. still, sitting here now i cant believe it!

 so i get ready, and leave to go.. can i find the church? NOPE.. sooo i turn around and start looking again. yeah, i found it.. yay me.. =o) 

 i sat kate gorton at the door.. so i sat with her. laura ang and jamie sat with us too. and then jess came a little after us. 

 amy walked down first, and looked beautiful!! then kait and pat came down. UMMMM i thought i was going to die. it was sooo breath taking. it was so wierd to see the girl i met when she was 3 years old, walking down the aisle in a beautiful wedding gown. so now, katie and jamie are busting out crying, im taking pictures with my loud ass camera.. and the priest is so quiet you cant even hear what hes saying. 

 me and katie were cracking up though, cause she said it was like a ""C star"" wedding. first, there was kaits grampa.. who looks like that old guy that was in that movie ""cacoon"".. or better known as the quaker oats guy. then there was bens dad who looks like howie mandell.. and thennnn there was kaits uncle david who looked like kato kalin. it was crazy. =o) 

 after the ceremony we all went to the guard where the reception was. i parked at the radisson and walked up with Bri, Matt and Katie. fun times walking the streets of new london.... so we get inside... head for the food.. you know, the usual. ate, sat on the stairs cause there were nooo seats anywhere and all of us just talked. it was so much fun. we took crazy amounts of pictures, i hope i dont look completely retarded in most of them. maybe theres a select few that will come out some what decent. 

 after amy pulled my ass out on the dance floor.. we pretty much stayed there the rest of the night. it was fun, dancing with my friends that ive known for my entire life. we took a Milligan Family picture.. me included... =o) theyre like my second family since forever.. so it was only right. the only one that was missing was my ""boy"".. RIP =o( he was there in spirit.. right aim and kait. ANNNNYways..

 kaitlyn and pat danced their ""father daughter dance"" to the saddest fucking song. i was balling. i couldnt stop myself. and i lost it the minute amy said "" wow amb.. look at them. kait is my dads world... just look at that"" UMMM YEAH, that set me off. all i kept picturing was when we were little, and we were at milstone beach, and that fucking eel or whatever it was, bit me.... and kait and aim wouldnt get off the raft, so kait cried out to her dad,, and he came and got both her and amy. and thats all i could picture was this big man.. coming to rescue his little girls, and now here he was holding her in his arms.. trying so hard not to cry. WELLL let me tell you.. i did enough for him. then i lost it even more, when i look over and i see linda hysterically crying, and ellie giving her a hug to calm her down. 

 it was so beautiful, yet at the same time.. so sad. after that though... it was all happiness. =o) no more crying. 

 when kait threw the bouquet.. amy and katie dove for it. i thought amys dress was going to be ripped off, and kate went flying to the ground. it was hillarious. brett... well, brett showed us how white boys dance.. he cracks me up. matt showed his ""beat it"" skills.. and bri, found a ""boyfriend"" in Bill Mugavro. haha it was a great night. 

 we left around 1130 or so... and i came home. it was a very fun night.. lots of laughs, some tears.. and forever smiles. congrats kait and ben! 


 Kaitlyn Ann~

        How fast time has flown by. it seems like yesterday, you were running around your house.. in your little ruffled dresses, dancing around and singing. it seems like yesterday we were dancing around your room with hairbrushes, singing to stupid songs at the tops of our lungs.. or watching amy show us how to do ""the bartman"" in your living room. when i think back on all the memories me and you have, it brings the biggest smile to my face. other than amy, youre the only other person besides family that has known me for so long. theres so much kait. so many memories that will forever be burned in my brain. i still think the funniest one is when me you and my brother went on our big ""picnic"" a few summers ago at the arboritum.. and danny had to wear his brace for his back... haha, and all you kept saying was "" rub the brace.. rub the brace"". or there was that time that johnny made us ice cream cones, and i scared the shit out of you on gallows lane. Youre an amazing person kaitlyn... youre going to make a wonderful wife, and an outstanding mommy. i love you always. as much as i'll always love telling the space shuttle story. to the moon and back kaitwin.. =o)

"event","ok.. so i get this in the mail today, sent to me by someone that i worked with at Carelot.... the people i worked for.. you know, the assholes. well, whenever a person leaves Carelot, they write up a nice little letter for you, explaining to the parents that youre leaving, and why. so after 4 years.. youd think that id get something nice right?? WRONG.. think again... this is what i get....


   ""Dear Parents and Families of Carelot. 

      It is with deep regret that i inform you that Miss Amber has chosen to leave our Carelot Family without notice. At this time, Miss Val will temorarily be covering our toddler program in her place. Miss Val joined Carelot in December 2003 as our assistant teacher for our Butterflies classroom. SHe has been working throughout the center also, where she has had the opportunity to enjoy all the classrooms."" 

  UM THATS FUCKING IT?! i did give my notice you mother fuckers.. like, are they trying to ""ruin"" my name with the parents or something, or give me a bad reputation. WOW.. looks like they forgot to put in there why i needed to get the FUCK out of that place in the first place. or, why i walked out the other day. because they are the worst fucking people on the face of this earth. i dont know who taught them how to get along with others... but they suck. 

 this is the rest of the letter. Debbie got a little thing about her leaving... but i cant?!

   "" with the unfortunate news, i must also inform you that Miss Debbie has give her 2 week notice. After 3 years with the Carelot Family, Miss Debbie will be pursuing a new career with high school students. please join us in wishing her the best."" 


     WOW... Heidi Pafias. youre a fucking bitch. and i did give my notice, sorry i was shy 2 days of it being 2 weeks. people really make me wonder sometimes... i guess they had to do this to make themselves feel a little better. fuck them.. i hope they have fun running that place into the ground, cause thats where its headed. 


 Amber 

 and by the way... roadwork on my road for 2 weeks is going to suck ass.."

"event","im getting so sick. i cant talk... it hurts to laugh, and my throat feels like its going to explode. 

 my dad was laughing at me tonight cause when i went to talk to him.. i sounded like a robot. my mom brought me over some medicine, and ive been taking that. i thought pills and shit like that was suppose to knock my ass out. UM wrong. im so wide awake. im wired. i feel like i could run the new york city marathon right now. i think, the cough medicine or whatever that pill was she gave me, was laced with crack cocaine or something. maybe ive developed a slight case of ADD.. cause i cant fucking sit still.. every two seconds im up doing something. i need help. but, im not going to the doctors!


 on another note.. i watched dirty dancing:havana nights, tonight. i rented it on payper view.. it was decent. i was surprised, cause i thought it looked shitty. but, i watched it twice, because there was no one online to talk to. people decide to just leave.. without saying anything.. thanks! 

 i talked to matt tonight. haha remember?? dj magic matt?? that was fun. 

 its blazing hot in my room right now. anyone feel like going to a sauna but dont feel like paying the money for one? OHH NOOO PROBLEM.. just come over, cause its about 9356 degrees in my room right now. 

 i just watched conan, and it was pretty damn funny. i wish i was friends with him. he seems like hed be a fun friend to have. i want to get tickets to go to his show. who wants to get some for me? thanks!!

 i think i might be a little delirious, or hallucinating or something. everything in my room looks like its moving, and im spinning. jesus christ.. what the hell is happening to me?


 oh my god, its so hot in here. im going to take my temp... hold on. yeah. this thing doesnt work. we need to get a new one. because 91... yeah, id be dead. maybe it meant to say 191, because thats what i feel i am right now. even my hair hurts. why do i always get sick around this time of the year???? i hate it! 

 if anyone wants to hear how i sound like a man, or a robot.. take your pick, just give me a call.. now, tomorrow... whenever. i'll probably be up, cause god knows i cant fall asleep right now. maybe i'll pull an all nighter.  

 carson is making me mad. i think he should go back on TRL... thats the only thing he was good for. talk show host. no. hes not funny, and he sits there and laughs at his own jokes. and poor neve campbell is sitting there, looking all scared. she should just get up and leave. 

 there is no one online.. at all. john contillo,smarterchild, jeff.. who isnt talking and robbie.. who i dont talk to. 

 why dont you people stay up later?? im bored and i have no one to talk to. i think i should go to bed. i just had deja vu. i think i had a dream about me doing this,,, last night. has that ever happened to you???? you have a dream, dont remember it.. and then youre sitting there and something happens.. and you remember that was in the dream that you couldnt remember... well that just happened to me.. wierd! maybe i have some kind of ESP. ummmmm if thats the case, and some things in my dreams are coming true. i REALLY hope that other things dont happen.. yeah. thats scary. 

 and with that. im going to bed. i just got really tired, and really really cold. im thinking about sleeping with my coat on. and about 9 pairs of socks.. maybe a hat. its FREEZING in here. 


 goodnight. sleep tight. dont let the bed bugs bite!! 

hugs and kisses!

"event","after i gave my notice last week... ive heard nothing but stupid shit every day from at least one of my bosses. did i need to put up with it? no.. not at all. but i did, because i have for 4 years and im used to it. 

 they made me go to east lyme yesterday to do lunch breaks and so they could have yet another meeting with them. GREAT.. in the 4 years that ive been there, not once have i ever been sent out there for that. larry tells me i have two choices, A.) i can stay with Carelot, and continue to work in the waterford center or B.) i can leave friday, like i told them i would be, and go to east lyme for the remaining of the week to do lunches. 

 this was bullshit. so when he called this morning at 9 and asked me what my decision was, i told him.... "" im leaving on friday, it will be my last day"" where he then told me i was going to east lyme for the rest of the week. i walked into the office and told heidi was was not going to east lyme. i didnt want to. i felt like i was being punished for leaving and not getting a chance to spend time with my kids for the rest of the week. she said it was her idea to send me out there cause the kids need to get used to not seeing me... UMM THATS NICE... and i told her that i didnt think it was fair that everyone else that has left didnt have to do this, yet i have to. so with that, she told me shed think about it and get back to me. 


 so now im sitting in my class with my kids, watching a movie. val comes in and tells me shes here to relieve me so i can go to east lyme. oh fuck no... i made up my mind right then. that i wasnt letting them jerk me around anymore. i hugged deb and val goodbye, got my stuff together and left the room. so now im crying. and i see heidi in the hall. i tell her im going home and that im not going to east lyme. she tells me that they gave me my otptions and that she doesnt know what else to tell me. i used my ever so clever "" whatever heidi"" and turned and walked into busy bees.. my old class. i give heather a hug.. and walk into butterflies and see all my old kids. UMM i lost it

 so now im full out sobbing, hugging ruby telling her that i love her. and she says ""bye miss amby"" YUP.... that was it for me. i see heidi run into the room, so i haul ass out through the busy bee door, across the hall and into infants to say bye to mimi and sherri.. as im about to say bye to mimi.. heidi come bolting down the hall.... "" amber, if youre going to do it like this and stir everyone up, then you can just leave""    so i said.. "" no.. im saying bye to everyone""... "" NO... you need to leave right now."" so with that, i opened the infant gate, walked out the door and to my car. 

 i get in the car and now im balling. i call my dad and tell him everything that just happened and hes pissed. he asked for larrys number in east lyme.. and he then took it upon himself to call that fucker in east lyme. 

 i went and saw my mom at work, larry then called her telling her "" your husband just called and reemed me out. i dont need to take that. i feel awful that amber left so upset, i had no idea it was upsetting her. i dont want me and you to be on bad terms marilyn, blah blah blah blah blah.. he didnt give me a chance to tell my side of the story""   

 sooo my mom cut him off and told him she was in the middle of a metting. 

 my dad called back and told us what he said. he basically just told him that he was wrong for treating me the way hes been treating me. and ive put up with their shit for 4 years. he told him that all of them were fucked up, and had no idea how to treat people or how to run a business. my dad said hes sure he said more, but he couldnt really remember.. he was just screaming a whole bunch of shit into the phone.he said the only thing larry kept saying was ""i dont need to take this.. i dont need to take this... well she didnt give us two weeks"".... um kiss my ass larry. 


 so with that said. my last day at carelot was today... its pretty sad that it had to end like this, it could have been alot easier but, they decided that since i wasnt backing down and following all their commands like i usually do, that they had to make my last few days there a living hell. 

 Goodbye Carelot..... dont miss me too much, you fucks"

"event","so after a few arguments last night between a few of us... last minute, as always me marissa and meg decided to go out anyways. we went to margaritas and had a fun time.. i drove, cause i think megs going to drive tonight. so i sat back and watched the two of them throw drinks back. 

 we met a colorful arangment of people.... kinda scary, but fun. Kurt, who was drinking water trying to sober up because his friends left him there... sat with us to talk.. then there was the kid from poland that was celebrating his 21st b-day with his friend from Lithuania, they were insane... but i was laughing sooo hard.soon to follow them was the G-unit themselves... well, not really, but it looked like them. and i think we saw busta rymes too. haha it was great.  next, was bert... the man who was infatuated with marissa. all he did all night was stare. then he came back after he left to ask her if he could call her sometime. haha it was too funny.  after that came Jeff, the navy boy from all over that meg liked, that marissa went up to for her. yeah, crazy times at margaritas. 

 so both of them are pretty drunk, and im sitting there taking everything in. i hate being the Designated Driver.. even though the lithuanian said driving drunk is more fun.. "" woooooaaaaahhhh weeeeeeeeeee "" pretending to drive a car... you should have seen this asshole, i think he did crack in the bathroom. anyways....


 micheal from the martini bar that took care of all of us the night of marissas b-day. yeah, he works there now. and marissa, thinks that if she retells the story, he'll remember, haha he didnt.. but it was still fun to listen. lets see,,, what else happened.. yup, thats pretty much it for there. so we leave around 145 or so i drop meg off, then maris. i talked to jeff when i was leaving marissas and him and chad wanted to hang out with me and meg,, so i called meg told her to get dressed and i went to pick her up. so now i dont know where im going. jeff tells me how to get there, and then tells me he'll call me right back. yeah, he doesnt.. so now im on the road driving back and forth waiting.... nice...... finally he tells me which driveway it is, and that hes waiting there. chad ended up going to bed before we even got there.. so we sat in the driveway and talked forever. i thought i was going to fall asleep ON the driveway, so meg and jeff talked about highschool and other random stuff. it was fun though. we met this girl named Karen.. she was pretty nice, haha taught jeff how to do a dance. fun times. 

 after someone woke up and shut all the lights off in the driveway on us, we left. i had some problems backing out of that driveway,, but i managed haha.. 

 on the way home, im on my street and theres this car, driving down the other side of the road, practically on the grass in front of my neighbors house. as im coming up along side of them, they stop and look at me.. soo now im scared, pull into my driveway and run to the door.. as im doing this, they speed up and screetch righ infront of my driveway and start slowly driving by now. so i stop to watch what the fuck theyre doing. they just sit there and i just stand there in shock... and finally step inside my house and peek out the door. now they turn the corner soooo fast into east lake drive across the street.. do about 190 down around the dead end and come back up. and sit at the stop sign for about 10 minutes. what the fuck?!! so now im laughing.. is this a driveby?? is it someone i know? whats going on?? so now, they BLAST their music and take off down pilgrim road, heading towards chapman on the right side of the road this time.... and do about 900 miles an hour. i have NO IDEA what they were doing,,, who they were, or where they went to. but, it gave me some kind of entertainment for about 20 minutes or so. 

 so after that, i went to bed... woke up at 9 and went babysitting at denise's house in ledyard. the baby slept the entire time, so i layed on the couch put harry potter on, and took a nap. 20 bucks later, im home.. its pretty nice getting paid to sleep.   the Hutas called, and im babysitting on monday for taylor and ryan.. im soooo excited. i havent seen my babies in a very very long time! =o) aww i cant wait.. 

 anyways, im rambling about absolutely nothing.. and its pointless so im gonna go. 


 <3 Amb =o) 


*** its so wierd because, planes fly over my house every single day... and since today is 9/11... i dont know why, but they seem like theyre sooooo much louder today, and so much lower. im probably just paranoid, but every time one flies over.. i look out my window.*** No one will ever forget that day, or what they were doing.... 

 i was washing the sink off after we painted pictures at work, when i found out. =o( soo sad. what were you doing??"

  where to start.... 

 ended up going out with brandon the other night... that turned into a huge mess.. i never should have left my house, but oh well... shit happens i guess. 

 me and marissas trip to New York on sunday was ruined because of me, and my stupidity... but hopefully shes still not mad at me.. sorry marissa =o( 

 i had a job interview on tuesday morning before work.. and it went pretty good.. cause i got the job. i gave my notice yesterday to work, and it was the greatest feeling in the entire world. knowing that im out of there soon, gives me the biggest smile across my face. =o) 

 lets see... what else has happened.. ive finally realized that, even though no matter how much you want to trust someone.... it always... always backfires. i forgive people WAYYY too easily, and i need to stop, because in the end.. the only person that ends up getting hurt,, is me. and i know,, i know, ive heard it MANY times.. from a few people, you know who you are... that i need to stop and listen to them for once because theyre right, and i guess it took this to teach me. oh well,,, life has a funny way of teaching you lessons.... 


 and thats pretty much all i have to say, well... im off to the gym now, while missy and steph are having their ""girls night in"",,,, im very very jealous!

 anyways... 

   i was sitting in my room tonight, looking at all my pictures that i have, and it just made me smile. its so wierd, how you can forget all these things, and events and memories... and you look at a picture, and it all comes back to you, like it happened yesterday. its wierd, cause by looking at some of the pictures, i can remember exactly what i was doing when it was taken.. its strange.


 you know that commercial when they say "" scent is the strongest memory"".. haha how true is that?!!! i dont know.. i sound retarded, but i just think its so great, how you can sit back,, look at old things and remember how it used to be. and that makes me smile so big. 

 i dont know where i read it today, but i think it was in Ali's away message... something about ""take as many pictures as you can""...it was cute. 


 ALSO... my new favorite thing i found online tonight was this poem. ive never heard it before.. so i thought it was cute =o)

 I ran up the door, closed the stairs, said my pajamas and put on my prayers, turned off the bed and jumped into the light, all because you kissed me goodnight! 
The next morning, I woke and scrambled my shoes, polished my eggs, and toasted the news, I couldn't tell my left from right, all
 because you kissed me goodnight! Then I put on my hair, and brushed my clothes, put my shoes on my fingers and goves on my toes. I flew out the door and ran a kite, all because you kissed me goodnight! 
That evening at last I felt normal again, so I picked up my mom, and called the phone, I spoke to the puppy and threw Dad a bone, even at midnight the sun was still bright, all because you kissed me goodnight!

anyways.. i suppose i should get to bed... since i have to be up by 7.. yeah, nice one Amber... once again. 

 night you guys!!! =o)

"event","do you ever feel like youre more responsible than your parents?? i mean... honestly, why do i always feel like im the one that has to plan things... and make sure they get done... or else we wouldnt be doing them.. 

everyone tells me to just leave it alone... ""fuck them"".. but i cant. i cant get away from it. even on vacation i was getting calls about it.. WHAT THE FUCK can i do... all the way from texas? NOTHING! ""stay out of it.. it has nothing to do with you Amber"" is what some people tell me.. well it does have something to do with me, when im constantly hearing about it, or listening to it. 

 im so sick of it. granted, all the shit thats going on with them, but whatever. im always.. ALWAYS stuck in the middle. i hear my mom bitch.. i hear my dad bitch.. and then i have to ""fix"" it. i know i dont HAVE to do it.. but everything always gets sooo miscommunicated. danny listens but, chooses not to make this huge thing out of it like i tend to do.. i know, i over do alot of things.. but whatever ...  
 i never should have come back from vacation. nothing good has come out of me being back here...at all.

"event","ok.. big event that happened tonight?!.....


 colleen marissa and i are at khols.. looking at the jewelry.. and when im just looking.. i like to be left alone. if i need help, i'll ask for it. anyways.. colleen asked what time they closed, cause we didnt want to keep them waiting on us... and the bitch behind the counter  turns around and says "" who just asked me that?"" so i think... great, this is going to go good...... 


 so there we are, looking through this bin of stuff, and the lady asks me "" what are you looking for?""  .... "" umm... i dont know.. im just looking!"" .. ok, now, it MAY HAVE came out a litttttle bitchy, but oh well.. so she keeps talking... saying some of the stuff is ugly.. and how shed never wear it. ( yeah, all the stuff shes talking about, marissas holding, to buy it... hahaha ) so i smile over that, and maris casually puts it back.. haha  THEN.. she asks me AGAIN "" WHAT.. are you looking for""... I DONT KNOW. IM BROWSING... so i say... ""nothing... im done""... and she says.. "" well are you into church???? heres a jesus thing... ooooh how about softball?"" and before she finishes. i blurt out ""NO!"" and start walking away... "" HOW ABOUT NUMBER 1?!!"" i keep walking behind colleen... where colleen says "" noo... but she goes number 1"" i was DYING... .so i keep walking, giving the lady and attitude, and she yells.. 


 "" WELLL..... looks like we got a REAL CROWD PLEASER HERE"".... 

 uhh,,, excuse me?!... "" YEAH... THANKS!!! that makes me feel REAL good...."" i say... 


   hahaha im telling you... the nerve of some people! marissa and her mom were laughing so hard as we walked away,, that i couldnt help but smile.. and think "" did i really just make this 90 year old womans day... working at khols all day must do a number on your sarcastic remarks to customers... well. im glad i could help her out! 


 oh,,, and i got home and i was bored.. so i have a lovely new icon for AIM... haha i tried to crop the shirt i was wearing.. but, it wouldnt fit... if you want to see the entire picture.. haha just ask... anddddd i have the cutest new icon on here... its of me and danny when we were little!! how adorable are we!!!??

"event","hello... =o) 

 yeah.. i said i was stopping this for awhile, which i did.. because, i was just typing the same shit over and over again. it was boring me.. so im sure you guys LOVED it.

 anyways... 




     this weekend has been soo much fun!  well, first, let me start off with saying that Kaitlyn Ann... sent me THE CUTEST picture in the entire world the other day. my little nephew/neice ""Bun"" OH MY GOD.. i almost died. i cannot wait for that child to be born.. =o) 

 ok.. back to my weekend.   friday night me, manda, aim, meg, maris and kyle went up to Paddy's in Rhode Island. it was sooo nice there. the bar was right on the beach, and you could walk out and see the ocean and the waves.. it was so pretty. i was the driver.. so i stopped drinking awhile before we left. everyone else?.. yeah they were wasted. we met these guys, Jay, Craig and Seth.. and everyone hung out with them for most of the night. 

 me and meg went on a mission to find a guy with a tongue ring for marissa.. we suceeded, but, he was working.. so he said he couldnt. haah oh well..... 

 so around 1.. the bar closes.. and the three guys want us to go to some bar with them right here in good ol connecticut. so we go. the only thing i can think of when i think of that bar.. is GHETTO. it was the most ghetto  bars ive ever been to.. in my entire life. we, we danced a little.. hung out, talked, marissa got followed around by this 90 year old man. it was great! craig took care of him and yelled at him for her. 

 at around 2 or so.. we left the dirt trap.. and meg maris and kyle headed home. us?.. yeah we went to foxwoods. us three girls.. and the three guys. we got there, stayed for about 5 minutes.. realized we were beyond hungry... so we left, and went to rosies. 

 Jay..... is sooo obnoxious. he was so embaressing. screaming about mullets and fried chicken.. it was insane. needless to say, it was pretty funny though. 


 ended up dropping amy and manda off.. and got back to the house im watching at around 5 am... 




 ok, sooo that was friday, now saturday. i woke my ass up, crawled out of bed and went to get my hair done. after that, i went to a picnic at work.. where stupid bitches that i work with.. were talking shit about me, RIGHT infront of my face.. sooo i got up and left. i dropped andreanna off.. another girl i work with.. and ended up in her house talking to her parents for about 2 hours about my trip this summer. 

 me, manda and melis ended up going out tonight, and it was so much fun. we went to margaritas for some drinks.. and we talked,, caught up on some stuff. it was nice. 

 on the way there, brittany called me, and said we should go to septembers.. so after margaritas.. we headed there. we saw April and Jeff walking out, and they said to go to Stashs.. sooo we did. ive only been there once.. but, it was a lot of fun last night. we saw some people from school  jackie, marla brittany and some other people we went to school with.. and it was so nice catching up with everyone. it was wierd seeing them. but it felt fine, like it wasnt wierd. does that make sense?... ok,, good. 

 we stayed there for awhile.. mostly outside because it was soooooo loud in there. the band, whoever they were sucked ass..and needed to be ripped off the stage. 

 the people im house sitting for, Dave... he called me about 9 million times. telling me "" dont have sex with my animals"".. haha so brittany gets on the phone and starts meowing.. i almsost died.. it was the funniest thing. jeff told us everyone was going back to his house.. so we went there after. by now.. im drunk and have to pee like nothing else. someone was in the girls bathroom for about 9 hours.. so i used the guys. it was nasty. there was piss all over the place, it was gross. 
 
 we made it to jeffs.. hung out for a little while, drank, laughed.. sat there... and then we left. 

 manda dropped me off at the house im watching.. and i went to bed. woke up this morning, and called my dad to come get me, cause i had my car at my house..


 so that leaves me here, right now.. typing in this thing. dont know when the next update will be.. but i hope you enjoyed this one!

"event","hi guys!! i havent written in a long time.. not since minnesota and the mall of america. LOTS of stuff has happened.. but if you know me, im wayy to lazy to write all about it, so i'll just go into little detail.. 

 we went to mt. rushmore, a drive through animal park, we went down in some old cave, yellowstone, saw a real wild bear, old faithful, drove through idaho and wyoming the two more BORING states in the world... almost ran out of gas in wyoming where i pretty much started crying and praying for there to be a gas station the next corner i turned.. there was, and i wanted the lady at the gas station to be my best friend.. lets see, what else has happened... 

 we drove longgg days, saw lots of hippies on the side of the road in the MIDDLE of nowhere, trying to ""GO WEST"".. yeah, in your dreams would i pick your nasty stank ass up... 

 onward to California. we went and saw the HUGE redwood trees... they were massive. we both got out and took a ""treehugger"" picture.. yeah,  we were both cracking up.. cant wait to get those asshole pictures back =o) 

 so we stop at some town called crescent city for the night, and then the next day we were off to san fransisco. we went over the bridge 'full house' style. and went to fishermans warf and all that fun stuff.. then,,, we left to go to LA.. 

 we stopped for the night, and got into LA the next day... got a little lost in spanish harlem.. but its ok, we stopped a few hours later, after driving around in circles and stayed the next few days at a hotel in beverly hills. we went on tours, saw famous peoples houses, saw the hollywood sign, saw the anchorman movie premire at the chinese theatre... anddd saw christina applegate. fun times in hollywood! 

 we went to san diego next, sea world, the zoo.. we did it all.. fun, LONG days.. and lots of smelly animals.. but it was fun =o) i got a stuffed koala bear, and i named him sydney.. hes my new baby.. but dont worry.. i still have cuddles.. =o)

 we went to mission beach, and walked around. it was too shitty to lay out on the beach.. so we went shopping instead and jam packed my car with more shit we dont need. oh well.. it was fun. 

 then we left and headed to vegas =o)!!

 we got here.. found a close cheap hotel... not too far from the strip.. and settled in for the night. we layed out by the pool in what felt like 500 degree weather. and some NASTY old man layed next to me in his chair.. started spraying himself with tanning oil... sooo much that he was a giant human grease ball. it was disgusting. he turns to me and says.. "" sooo hows the hot tub?""... "" UMM.. i dont know, i havent been in"".... ""yeahh.. i guess its too hot for that huh?!?"" and he turns back over.. crazy old man

 so after we melted away we came in and got ready for a night out on the town.. we headed to the palms to the ghost bar.. and waited in line for like 20 minutes or so before we got to go up the 55 floors to the top. when we finally did, it was so great. it overlooked the entire strip.. and it was so pretty. maris got the first round of drinks.. i got the second.. and THEN, we met Gary. man oh man... Gary.. AKA: "" VEGAS BABY"" bought the rest of our drinks all night. he was CRAZY. he talked about our road trip.. and how jealous he was.. and had us toast to it. he made us make a pact that we would ""never forget this night, as long as we live. even though we'll more than likely never see each other again. we all have to promise""... yahhhhhh ok then. but.. free drinks?.. sure, bet your ass i'll make a pact to that. the next thing i know.. we're all taking pictures. haha and then.. before i know it... gary is kissing me.. and licking the back of my neck.. then.. he moves on to maris.  it was a crazy.. crazy night. it was fun though.. 

 soo we were drunker than fuck.. finally got back to the hotel.. were SO DAMN loud in the lobby, im surprised we didnt get kicked out. i guess the 200 dollars on alcohol that gary spent on us.. worked wonders on how we were acting... sooo pretty safe to say that today, we both felt like shit.. and did nothing. we went out tonight though.. gambled a little, ate dinner and went shopping. 


well... we're off to the hoover dam tomorrow.. then to the grand canyon.. where pats lighter.. my little orange traveler... will be making his final destination into the bottom of the grand canyon.. lighter.. its been fun driving with you =o).. hope you had a fun journey!!!! PEACE!

"event","haha, soooo we're finally in minnesota! 

 we went to the mall of america today, and it was CRAZY huge. it took is 6 hours to walk through it. there was soo much shit to do. theres an amusement park in the middle. that has 2 rollercoaster, a flume ride, swings and 2 spinning rides. then there was lego land, an aquarium anddddd i pet some sharks and some sting rays. there was like 600 store and a million places to eat. it was crazy. 

 so we walked around there for awhile.. and sat for a little while and watched peaople walk by... and their CRAZY outfits. so 6 hours later... we went and found the shuttle and it took us back to our hotel. 

 we came back here and just layed around. we were both really beat. tomorrow morning we head out to south dakota to go to mount rushmore. soo.. i'll write more when we get into town.. bye!

"event","well. since i last wrote, not too much has happened. we stayed at chris's house until thursday and left around 7 pm.... 

 the night before i was beyond drunk.... sooo i was pretty hung over the next day, so thats why we had to stay a little longer than we had hoped to.we talked to my cousin tiff that night... and chris ryan and dan said they all might take a trip out to ct by the end of the summer... we'll see how that goes..

 so anyways... we packed up my car on thursday, said bye to the guys... and left. haha im going to miss them. it was wierd staying with them for so long.. i kinda got used to it. oh well... im going back in october i think.. it will go by quick. 

 so we're on the road.. and we end up in Fickle, Indiana.. UM.... wrong idea. our hotel room was the nastiest place ive ever stayed in my entire life. i opened the door... and it smelled like someone died, the beds... were from 1900 i swear.. they were. the bathroom looked like a jail cell AND.. marissas matress..... had blood ALLL OVER IT. .i think someone was shot and killed there.. it was so nasty, i pretty much cried myself to sleep,,,, and i refused to walk on the carpet without my flip flops on. and i know,,, its gross.. but i couldnt bring myself to take a shower in that bathroom.... it was moldy, and nasty and i think someone died in it.. oh yeah, and the water.. tasted like oil... pretty safe to say, we were out of there when the sun came up. 

 so we're on the road again.. stuck in traffic near chicago for about 4 hours. when that was done. .you know, after i thought i was going to die... i drove for almost 12 hours today.. made it through 3 states... Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. and now, we're on Minnesota. we're here for 2 days.. going to the mall of america tomorrow. but.. im wicked tired, so im going to bed.. right after i call my cousin and tell him we finally made it... so he can answer the phone ""AAA how may i help you"".. haha crazy bastard!!

  ive been good.. ohio has been interesting. my cousin seriously cracks me up... its great. his room mate on the other hand.. has left a bruise on my arm.. from pinning me to the ground.. you know "" beating information out of me"" ... asshole. hes also been taking my phone, and sending messages to some of my friends.. im so sorry... 

 he got my computer the other day.. and the same thing happened. oh well... hopefully people knew it wasnt me. sorry about that


 ANYWAYS.. my aunt is making us dinner tonight... thats why we've been here for so long. we're leaving sometime tomorrow. i told chris id come back to visit him.. its really nice here. i think i could definatley move out here.. 


 well.. nothing much has happened.. watched some ducks yesterday, and watched maris start screaming at the geese because they were attacking these baby ducks... it was pretty funny..... anyways, i'll let you go.. i'll write more later! 


 bye! =o)

"event","well. we left thursday morning.. my brother left us a note.. which was opened at marissas house.... haha it was a scavenger hunt a la dan... crazy ass stuff on the list.. that we're going to try to do... well, most of them anyways.. 


then we went and saw colleen at work. and then to see aaron at his work. then, we headed off.... at exit 4 on rt 9.. maris remembers she forgot her sneakers. so since we were only about 20 minutes away.. we drove home to get them. her dad thought we were on crack.. but i thought it was pretty funny.. after that, we were off again... this time... to niagra falls in canada. 

 it took FOREVER to get there.. well it seemed like it anyways.. it sucked. but we had fun. at one point i was laughing so hard.. i almost peed my pants, because i think maris had some kind of verbal siezure. she kept messing up her words SOOO bad.. and it was so funny!!! then.. hhahaha she sees a ""grand caravan"" and says "" LOOK AMB... I DIDNT KNOW THEY HAD A GRAND CANYON VAN""... i say.. "" UHH. .they dont... thats called, grand caravan""... yeah, we laughed for about 20 minutes.. haha it was great. 

 so finally.. FINALLY, we make it to canada... and.. we didnt get lost once! which made us very proud. we go through customs.. and me being a retard.... when asked where i was from.. instead of saying "" the US.. "" i said "" waterford"" she must have thought i had some problems or something.. haha.. oh well..

 we get to canada... find a hotel, and check in for the night. first of all.. the room smelled like asshole.. the beds were hard as rocks.. and the shower.. well the shower was niagra falls.. the tub faucet spurted water out SO god damn fast.. that it would splash up everywhere. where water would then get all over the god damn floor. then the shower part,,, would just mist. it took about 20 minutes to get my hair wet..hahahahah ANDDDDDDD the drain... wouldnt drain, so you were standing in a pool while taking a shower. and, it happened to maris, but not to me.. she was getting a breeze from somewhere.. and everytime she took a shower, id hear her in there cracking up.. fun times in the ""lodge by the falls""

 so i go down to get some ice... open our freezer,, and the people before us, left hamburger in there... and it was unplugged since they left, god knows when. i almost passed out. it was the nastiest smell ive ever smelled in my entire life. it was so gross. so i went down to tell ""Dorothy"" (i dont know her name) the 90 year old front desk clerk.. and she came up to take care of it for us.. 

 the next day, we went and saw the falls... and walk around town. it was so pretty. then we got lunch. um, i dont think they use cows for the hamburgers.. i think they use moose or something. because that was the nastiest burger ive ever had. but oh well. .something to remember canada by. 

 after walkinbg around, catching the bus. and going back to our hotel.. we ordered pizza and called it a night. we were heading off to pittsburg the next day.. or so we thought. 


 we get an early start (well.. for us) and head out around 1030.. got lost once... but it was quickly fixed within 10 minutes. we're good like that. go through customs again, where ""abbey"" this mean mean man.. questioned us like crazy. oh well.. he did good at his job of scaring me.. 

 so a few hours later.. we get to pittsburg.. and can we say GHETTO?!!!.. i was scared for my life.. seriously. so we get back on the highway, and start to head off to mikeys house (marissas cousin).. which is why we were there.. so i pull off the highway, and maris calls him.. what?!!?? what.. HES NOT EVEN HERE!! hahah so now ,we're lost... mikes not around.. and im on the phone with my cousin chris.. .getting directions to ohio. 

 yeah... get lost again.. well not really our fault. the highways were under construction.. and everything was detoured.. so get on the highway again... and we're seriously in traffic forever.. so following everyone else.. i turn around on the exit ramp.. go up the wrong way... and speed onto the highway.. to avoid being hit by the oncoming traffic.. haha it was crazy. after that. we stopped and asked for directions at some gas station.. where this nice nice man. who we named ""chuck"" told us to follow him to the highway. THANKS CHUCK!! 


 so we're on the way to columbus now.... we stopped.. got some lunch at long john silvers... and headed on our way again. where that leaves me to right now.. as im sitting in a days inn in cambridge ohio. =o) lots of driving. lots of laughs.. tired. tired girls.. 

 we're off to chris's house tomorrow... soo i hoped you enjoyed reading about our 3 days so far... sorry if its long.. but i needed to type... haha serious withdrawls for me... this phone thing,, is NOT doing it for me.. it takes me WAYYY to long to type on that thing.. and i get frustrated and annoyed.. anyways. im gonna let rissa use this thing for awhile.. seeing as theres no one for me to talk to online anyways... haha ohhh well..  call if you want.. i'll have my cell on.. OH, and if youre going to text me.. make sure you leave your name or something.. cause i got one from someone the other day, and i have NO IDEA who it was. ok.. bye for now.. until the next time i can use my computer where ever we are.. BYE!!!!

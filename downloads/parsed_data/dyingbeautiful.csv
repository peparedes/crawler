 love is patient love is kind. it dose not envy. it dose not boast. it is not proud. it is not rude. it is not self-seeking. it is not easily angered. it keepes no record of wrongs. love dose not delight in evil but is happy with the truth.. it always protects. always trusts. alwys hopes. always perserves.


 just somthing that was on my mind...


 whoever stated that you never realize what youve had untill you lose it  made sence







""My eyelids are heavy, and the night's wearing on 
Your story's familiar, and your innocence is gone 
We'd burn like the morning then break like your heart 
Fall in love without warning just to fall back apart 
All fevered and blistered, with nothing at stake """

 last night i had a huge talk with my brother about stuff ive been going through/ feeling.. it was nice to vent out..   i dont know ive not been happy with how i am latley and i know. alot of people arent particuarly happy with how i am either. and i  am begining to despise myself for it. one of the most thing i hate to do it hurt someone.and ya know.. i feel like i am. and people are telling me that i am. people seem not to confront me about it. but go through other people. i dont understand how i can go from being happy to being this down.  well i hate it and i cant stand how people can be sometimes.  but i gues i  deserve it.  i dont know why im writing this in here because its pointless. i wish friends would just be friends and be there for me but its not happeneing. one thing that is makig me happy is treys comming down in a few hours. i am just happy to be able to talk without being talked about.  i dont know. this might just be a faze and i hope so"

"event","well yesturday i woke up late and sat around, did alot of nothing, then called up some people to see if they wanted to come chill, soo krystle and jimmie came and picked me up and we drove over to amandas to get her and carrie. so we get them and head over to the freehold mall to suprise brett at his job haha. it was pretty funny seein him in a bunny outfit boy oh boy. so we just all walked around and did nothing really.but it was neat. then we went over to bretts for a few so he could change and stuff. he has a cute house. so then we came back to my house and sara and julia were already here so we  chilled and stuff, i got a very nice scarf from holly, and sara, (thanks girlys ;)) trying to figure out if max, matt,eddie, and joe were gona come or not.. but it turned out they went to matt's cusins. and we didnt hear from eddie til later on that night.  i havent seen any of them in awile it sucks. soo then we headed over to funtimeamerica to play lazer tag haha.. yes we killed the guys.  they think they did really good tho. but we let them think that.;) so we just hung out there for awile not really doin anything, tom was playin some dance game, it seemed fun. then we headed to applebeese and got food and all that great stuff.  then back to my house and we chilled and watched a movie, then at like 4 or so they left and we headed to bed. carrie and i, i think kept people awake it was so hot in the bed we tried to get 5 people in the bed. it was impossible. so it was almost light when i finnaly got to sleep. 

thismorning krystle, and sara left early for some stuff they had to do, so we slept for awile then woke up eventually. and just sat around. it was a good time.  

you ever get in one of those state of minds where you just think a lot.. and it becomes to much, so much goes on in life. theres always thoughts through my head. sometimes it gets to be a pain because i think to much. mostly when im tired i think alot haha...i dont know if it makes sence.. oh yess!!
next thursday treys commin down! im totaly stoked, its been a year since i saw him last, so im very excited haha. weeeeeeeeell im done now

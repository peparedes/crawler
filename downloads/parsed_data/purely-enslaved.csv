My life is finally turning around for the better, one of the best things in years happened to me this weekend past.  I reunited with long lost friends.  The very friends in which turned my life around and created ""the best days of my life"" about 3 years ago.  This was all thanks to my very own new car and my will to see them again.  It felt like I had never left and in 3 years I felt, once again, what it was to be truly happy and free.  Looking out from Veda's deck toward the vast beauty of forest in the country she owned complete with a lake, filled me with joy and I realized where I have always longed to be and vowed to visit as often as possible.  Veda, Veda's boyfriend, Dez, Lewis, Justin and I all spent the night intoxicated in more ways than one and in the morning I had to make my journey back to hell, just a mere 5 hours away from paradise.  Just the beginning of my new road to healing...

In other news, I have a reasonable job, I received a new room in the house I share which has been done to suite me very well.  Rent has increased, but the room is much bigger and the prize is not only a good deal but well worth it.  And to keep me company in this new room of mine I have a little companion, a baby ball python.  

I would have written more if I hadn't just noticed the time.  My roommate Adam and I have made plans to go ice skating soon and I should really get ready.  Wish me luck, perhaps I'll take photos of my battle wounds...

"event","I know its been a while and I do appologize for that.
I am now in Fort McMurray living with my long time best friend Ashleigh.
So far all seems to be well, there are a few annoyances such as people not helping in the cleaning department and so on.
I have a new job working as a Security Officer and I make pretty good money.
I am quite home sick and I miss my ex Richard.  I think about both Richard and my family quite often, infact most of the time.
Ashleigh and I rarely see eachother or hangout and thats depressing.  But she has the weekend off and I think we will do shrooms together.  We have never done them together before, so this should be interesting.
Anywho, not much else to tell so Ill leave you with a quiz.

"event","I miss Richard.
I love him truly with all of my heart and yet I felt I had to put our relationship on hold.  Its killing me in every way possible.  Hes just so busy with his own life and preparing for his own future that I feel almost in the way most of the time.  Of course there is more to it than just that, but its not something I can bring myself to get into with full detail right now. 
He didnt know what to say for most of our conversation.  I wish he would have said more, I keep asking myself if I am worth fighting for in some respects.  I dont want to be here anymore.  I want to be there, with him.  If he truly loves me I believe that he will call for me, if he doesnt call for me, when ready, then I guess it just wasnt meant to be.  That hurts so much to think about.  His pictures are everywhere in my room and they will stay that way.
I fight with myself to know if Ive done the right thing.  I keep checking my e-mail in hopes that he has writen me on his thoughts and such as he said he would.  Nothing yet, but knowing me I will check every hour of every damn day until I get one.  
Why do I cry so much?"

"event","2 more weeks and I shall be back to everything I know and love.  I have been living here far too long for my liking and I have finally decided to do something about it.  I wish I knew what took me so long.  The decision came about within a matter of minutes and to those who do not know me well, thats all it takes.  
When I get there one of my first tasks is to paint my new room.  The original plan was to have it a nice dark red with a black trim and I was hoping to do some celtic knot/cross stencils in black as well.  However Ashleigh doesnt want me to paint the colonial door because its expensive.  So I had to work with a white (so sickening) door.  My new plan is to do it Tim Burton style...  Thats right black and white strips all the way.  I absolutely adore Tim Burton...  Hopefully I can find some distorted shapes and such for it as well...  For example 3 oddly shaped mirrors would go nicely on the wall.  
Ashleigh is giving me her old bird cage and I would like to hang it in a corner...  Im still deciding on the type of bird I would like...  I know it has to be something the size of a budgie, but I dont really want a budgie...  A love bird perhaps?  Who knows...  Too bad bats are illegal, I would kill for a flying fox, oh so gorgeous.  Later I will get another snake and perhaps a bearded dragon...  I love animals and have a need to be surrounded by them.
One thing I am most anxious about when I get settled in is going to Edmonton so I can shop for all the glorious clothing I love so much.  Velvet, Lace and satin, Oh my! along with so much more.  First item on my mind... a corset of course =D.  I have been without these things for 2 years... I live in such a secluded province, where anything outside the norm is not accepted, therefore there are no stores or shops that provide a good variety of all the things I love and need to, in some opinions, survive.  Of course there was always the internet, but that is not the same thing.  And oh the shoes, the shoes, can you tell im ecstatic?
Well I had best be going now.

"event","I know that it has been a while since Ive taken the time to write in here.  I do apologize, but Ive been in a ""mood"" that I just couldnt seem to shake, one of the many branches of depression I suppose.  No worries though, everyone has their days, I just have a few more...
Holy sweet jesus and mother of fuck Im in some pain right now.  Curses on the Mrs. Dash extra spicy spice...  Such terrible heart burn.  The last time I had heart burn like this was when Richard was here and I kinda kept him up with me because it hurt so bad.  I wish he was here to help me with it now though.  My dramatic side is whispering ""ulcer"".  Such voices -=shakes head a little=-.  
Anyway... Whats been going on with me lately?
My plans have yet again changed.  Crazy huh?  I seem to be good at straying away from any set path in life.  I have never really liked to walk that zombified line of followers.  Due to my constant feelings of loneliness, missing my boyfriend and my friends, I have decided that I can no longer wait here for Richard to tell me that he is ready to have me come to England.  This place is killing me in so many ways and Im loosing myself to the madness of being alone.  I feel that it will be best for me to move back to what I am used to and be around people to help ease my pain and aid in the ever slowing flow which is time.  I will be moving in with my best friend Ashleigh and her roommates in mid february.  This decision came out of no where, in such a manor that at first Ashleigh didnt even think I was serious until I started calculating a good date with reguards to money, and available plane tickets.  Im hoping this decision leads me down a happier road because right now Im rotting with unhappiness and I am the only person who can change that.  Well with the help of Richard of course, but that doesnt seem to be too soon.  So here I stand, ready to walk down yet another new road.
My hair falls finally arrived in the mail.  I placed my order sometime around the begining of october and some mix up had occured, but that was taken care of, took a little longer than I had hoped, but it worked out in the end.  The falls are quite stunning and looking at them I have found that they really are simple to make and I feel that it will be fun to take them on as a project.  Ive made wool extensions, but those are made differently, or atleast I make them differently.  Synthetic might be a little harder to work with and make a little bit of a mess my first few tries, but Im sure they will turn out just as great as the wool ones Ive made. =D  Ill definately have to post a few pictures when I put them in.
Well I know I had more to write, but my mind went blank (a common problem as of late).  Perhaps its best to take it slow and give myself time to crawl back into my usual creative, artistic, verbal frenzy sides.  -=yawn=-

I spent some time trying to get more people to join my community in an attempt to raise interest and accually get some posts on it.  So far Ive succeeded in one new member, which is a start right?  Along with spending hours randomly finding journals to post an invite to my community in, I have also created a banner for it that I am also damn pleased with.  
<center><img src=""http://freehost05.websamba.com/enslaved/images/MorbidVanityBanner2.jpg""></center>
In addition to the banner I have added a bit of fun to the info page in the form or a site poll.  Its coming together nicely.
Ive recently started a Morbid Vanity site which I have been taking my sweet ass time putting together.  The outline is pleasing but the graphics are taking a while.  Hopefully the site will be up and running for the enjoyment of the members of <lj user=""morbid_vanity""> as well as the public sooner than I think.
In other news, I finally have a job.  Its nothing fancy, infact far from it, but its money, and money is definately something I need to put away.  I will be working for a fast food restaurant -=sigh=-.  I recently told someone that I believe and fear that I will be 50 and still be stuck behind a fast food counter such as KFC.  I know in my heart I am much better than that, and I know my determination wont let me suffer that fate.
Ive started writing again, and perhaps in the future I will post one of my recent pieces.  Since I was told about the death of Tony, who was an excellent writer, I feel as though I should really take the time to write as I used to.  I guess I kind of fear that with time, I will loose the talent I possess, or perhaps just forget how to put thoughts to paper.  I know writing is appart of me and that may never happen, its just does anyone really know how long it can take to loose yourself, or even how long you have left to express yourself in such ways?
Oow in more exciting news, for me of course, I will be getting a leather jacket which comes to my ankles.  Its going to be tight fitting at the top and taper out from the hips down and perhaps have a bit of a flair to the sleeves.  Im so excited, Ive wanted one for so long.  Patience seems to work in my favor as always.  Its definately going to be hot! And definately go nicely with whatever outfits I get in England.  Oh yeah baby!

"event","Middle of the night and as usual, I can't sleep. Its been a while since Ive writen in here. And in all honesty, I dont really know what to write about even now. Ive had a lot on my mind recently. Just random thoughts which fly through my mind at a tremendous speed.
I feel like everything is on pause.  Im sure everyone experiences that once in a while.  But thats anxiety for you 
-=giggles=-.  Why cant we be born with a patience button or something.
Anywho enough of that.  Its been so long since my last post.  My birthday was on the 2nd and I am now 20.  20 sounds so strange to me.  Ive been looking through collections of my past.  Photos and old notes which all tell really only one side of parts of my life.  I mean who really takes a picture of bad times in their own life.  Perhaps its a way in which we try to keep from remembering horrible things.  Unfortunately amoung the random thoughts I have been experiencing, are a lot of horrible memories Im sure most people would want to forget.  But being the odd person I am, I prefer to hang onto them because they were half of what has made me the person I am today.  20 it still doesnt fit.

For my own amusement I took this quiz that I found.  Since these are the quizes that you post, here she is.

"event","There really hasnt been anything happening since Richard left.  Since Ive had to come to the reality that Richard needed to leave without me to organize things before I go, my attention span has cut down dramatically (it was never good to begin with), my stomach is always queasy with anxiety, and I find that Im too nervous or SOMETHING to really focus on something without getting frustrated.  
Ive become ""something"" of a wreck, it seems, though I still function well enough most of the time that people around me either can't tell or just pretend not to notice. 
My hysterical tears have been replaced by quieter sob like tears. I miss Richard so much and I dont think anyone really understand or comprehends just how much.  Everything reminds me of him, all my thoughts involve him in some way and I feel an overwhelming desire to just touch him, smell him or taste him. I know its probably not going to be long and we will be together again.  I know to most people I sound pathetic or like a cry baby as such, I just really cant help it.  He posses my mind, body and soul.  Without him Im nothing.  I miss you my baby and love you so much. 

Tonight I was told that someone I have known for over a year was taken from this world in a fatal car accident.  I dont really know what else to say about it because Im so lost for words, thoughts and even lack the belief that he is gone.

Well Richard and I are about to go into St. Johns for two nights before the plane takes him away from me.  Plans have changed and I am no longer going with him to England, but instead I will wait for him to straighten a few things out there first.  Im going to miss him so much, in fact I already miss him if that makes any sense.  The part that I dread the most is having to say something like ""well I will see you later"" or ""speak to you on the phone later"" or something like that just before I release my grip and he steps away from me to wards a terminal that leads to his plane.  
I know it probably wont be long and before I know it I will be with him again, its just the parting, goodbye, see ya later thing that is really getting me.  I also know that its all for the best and its the easiest as well as safest way to ensure a good future together, which is a good thought.
I ask forgiveness to friends and family of which I know I will seclude myself from over the next little while due to the need to hide and be alone.  I know I will need someone to talk to, but I have a problem with being the first one to pick up the phone, which I know a few of my closest friends know that, such as Ashleigh and Kayla.

"event","So yeah, its been a while.  But please, lets not beat me all at once, one at a time will make the brutal experience last longer.  
To be honest I really dont have anything set in mind to write, so as usual Ill just ramble.
I have developed a new obsession with the band Seraphim Shock.  A lot of their songs really pull me in and make me feel like I once did when I would become lost in my music.  For anyone who has a love for music and has a taste such as my own I highly recommend this band to you.
Ive been having urges to write, but it just feels like as of late Im either too busy to take a moment and write down my thoughts in the form of poetry or when I get a moment my mind goes absolutely blank.  I know that eventually I will get out of that rut and will get a good poem out of my head.  Its all a matter of time.
Lately I have been feeling quite antisocial.  I have no desire to see, talk or be around anyone other than Richard.  The one person I want around but have to wait so patiently for.  I do regret my antisocial tendencies at times because I feel as though people view me as cruel or rude, when they dont seem to understand that I just am not in the mood to be all smiles and much of a conversationalist.  I highly doubt Im the only one to feel that way at times...
My headaches are coming on quicker lately as well.  Before it was like I could tolerate more stress and frustration before my head would pound, but that adds up over time and my tolerance is shrinking to nothing.  The littlest form of stress or frustration triggers a massive headache.  I keep telling myself that will come to an end soon, very soon and that Im so much stronger than this.  
I woke up this morning feeling relative ok, just a little tired and sluggish as usual.  As I forced myself to sit up I thought ""Richard is coming in 12 days, and 2 months after that I will be in England"".  Right away feelings of being overly excited, nervous and anxious hit me hard.  I keep trying to calm myself down, but Im not having much luck in that department.  
Anyone have any advice?"

"event","Me again... Followed by an attempt to get a few things out.  Here goes...
My parents went out to the bar last night and at first all was well, I did however know that it wouldnt stay that way on account it never does when they come home from the bar.  
It started off the usual way with my father bitching at me about the money my mother spent in the machines and how she keeps holding her hand out for more and when he doesnt have anymore to put in her hand she turns on her big attitude.  So after he told her he would go home and pick up more money for her and his spontaneous bitching to me, he decides not to go back to the bar where my mother is waiting for him but rather fuck off to a friends house.  
My mother calls and asks a bunch of questions that I didnt know the answer to and later comes home with a woman named Christine who we all know.  My father was home by that time and was snappy at my mother and they argued a bit.  My mother and Christine both asked me to stick around and have a few drinks and I said sure, thinking it would only be a few minutes which turned out to be around an hour.  Everything seemed to be fine until out of no where without warning my mother turns on me.  She no longer wanted my company and made it clear in a harsh kind of way.  When I told her she sounded like a bitch that just heated things even more and we got into an argument.  I told her I didnt understand what her problem was but I did know that it had nothing to do with me, and to not take it out on me as I left the room.  She then persisted the argument by coming in the room that I went into after leaving.  As she had her say I sat there and just looked at her saying nothing.  Then I asked her if we were done and that pissed her off anymore.  She then left and slammed the door.  
After about 5 minutes I heard her crying and talking to Christine about me, doing her usual mind manipulation and turning the image of what people have just seen, being her in the wrong, into something that circles around me and how she is the victim.  I then made the mistake of going out there to set things straight and my mother stated ""August 2nd and this will all be over, you hear me, good fucking reddens"".  Now that hurt the most, August 2nd is when I leave the country and travel to England with Richard.  
So anyway after I drove Christine to a club she wanted to go to, Richard gave me a call.  He seemed to have the same mental and emotional state as I did.  Neither one of us knew what to say to one another and the silence was deafening.  We kept asking each other what the other wanted to do and all we could both answer was I dont know.  Eventually I made the suggestion that maybe he should let me go and call me back later when his head was clear.  To be honest I didnt want him to let me go, but I felt as though he wanted to let me go.  We have never let each other go while one or both of us are upset, but this time was a definite exception and it scares me.  I think I am loosing yet another thing in my life that means so much, and not just any old thing, but the most important thing, the one I love.  If that does happen I have no one to blame but myself..."

Less than 1 and a half months Richard and I will be physically together.  Thats right peoples we will be able to touch each other.  Give ya all 3 guesses where I crave touching him first =P.
I put out my resumes a couple days ago and I received a phone call for an interview today.  If all goes well I could be working at Quiznos.  Not bad I guess, its money in my pocket.  I must admit however I really want that bar tending position at West Side Charlees.  Im a little nervous about my interview though, I dont usually get nervous over things like this but it just so happens that I really really REALLY need this job.

I was thinking about the flight back to England earlier and that started to freak me out a little.  I could swear I even felt like I was on a plane thats how powerful my imagination took off.  I get nauseous for the entire trip whenever I fly. Not to mention it takes me like 20 mins just to walk straight after getting off the plane.  My body hates flying.  The worst part is Richard will be there to see me get all fucked up. >.< poor guy, I hope I dont projectile vomit all over him or anything.

The people at the post in England told Richard it would be a week.  3 weeks later, just as I was giving up hope and thinking they lost it or something, I come home to a nice surprise on my kitchen table.  I was ecstatic and did a little ""jump around and freak out"" happy dance.  The box also arrived in my possession damaged, but lucky for me nothing was missing.
Everything in the box was a surprise because Richard wanted it that way and wouldnt tell me what was in it.  Im glad he didnt though, it was all worth it.  He sent me a bottle of Oscar perfume, a wicked silver plated dragon ordainment from a collection, a tea bag squeezer lol, some chips aka crisps for my mother, a letter complete with 2 wonderful poems and a bunch of pictures YUM!
2 months my baby will be here with me on this big ass rock.  Im so excited, and so I should be.  I have so much to look forward to.  

In other news, its been days since Ive slept properly.  I mean I am diagnosed with insomnia and all but the past week has been really bad.

After that I had my shower and got myself ready.  However no amount of preparation could make my experience at the hospital any more tolerable.  Despite the fact that I was surrounded by ill people of all ages and gender, any of which could be highly contagious, my fear was generally focused on the hollow stabbing tool I fear so much.  To be honest even that was tolerable to a point.  What caused me to want to kill the bitch who possessed the damn thing was the constant back and forth motion she felt was necessary in order to find some form of crimson life within me.  To her came no success in my left arm but she proceeded to inflict it with unnecessary torture anyway.  As she looked at me with slight concern she said ""let me know when it starts to hurt.""  I said nothing in reply, perhaps I was afraid that my mouth would run away with me.  After failing miserably she felt it would be a good idea to try my other arm -=roles eyes=-.  My right arm was cooperative to a point, it decided it would deliver my fluid of life slowly, maybe it has a mind of its own and felt I needed more than what my left arm was subjected to.  
On my way to classes I convinced my driver to stop at the post office to see if a box from Richard had arrived yet.  But with my luck I already knew what to expect... NOTHING.  My annoyance moves into a kind of depressing disappointment.  Hopefully it will arrive tomorrow.
So then we arrive at the school to learn that there has been a fire yesterday.  It appears the school shall remain closed for the remainder of the week, but we are to listen to the radio for any changes.  That was pleasing to me, I feel its a well deserved break for me.
Yesterday I learned that a good friend of mine, Kayla, is moving across the country and she wanted to spend more time with me before she leaves.  So today I took the liberty of going to her house to spend a good bit of time with her.  I got to see where she would be staying and it is a beautiful home.  Im sure she will be happy there, unlike here and that to me is a good thought indeed.
I then came home only to be reminded that Richard had pool tonight.  I guess I lost track of the week day.  Another unfortunate piece of information added to that was he has to work late at home and go into work early.  Im worried I will not get to speak to him tonight.  OMG just as I typed that the phone rang and its Richard YAY!
So anyway my blood sugar was at 14.8 not to long ago and I decided to go for another walk.  I stopped into my uncles house on my way back and we talked for quite a while.  He told me something that made me feel great to be who I was.  He said he always admired me because unlike him I was one who was who I was despite what others thought including my own family.  I stood out and even at his age he doesnt know who he is and yet he looks at me and I know exactly who I am being as it is Im only 19.
So there was the gist of my day.
Enjoy the stupid psycho babble?"

"event","Well I just got home from the city.  We live in the middle of nowhere and we have to drive for an hour to see a damn doctor.  Anyway I have to go and get some tests done to find out if I am diabetic or not and was given a few things to control my headaches.  Also my doctor has recommended that I take my insomniac self to some kind of therapist who does a relaxation routine.  I suppose I will give in and check this one out.  My doctor seems to have quite a thing for trying to get me to take interest in seeing a therapist.  She recommends one every time I see her. >.< 
On a brighter note I am extremely happy, overly excited and too anxious lately from what I am normally used to.  Why is that good might you ask?  And even if you dont ask you already know that Im going to tell you anyway.  Its good because I am experiencing all of these things due to the fact that Richard is coming to Canada for 2 months and from there we are leaving together.  Plans have changed from me going there first to him coming here and now we arent sure if we are going to go to England and live as planned.  We might stay here in Canada.  The whole experience of not knowing exactly whats going to happen is freaking me out a little, but to be honest its very exciting.  All of this just feels right, like it fits so perfectly.  I cant wait to share my life with such a wonderful person who is so perfect in my eyes.  
Im going to go fidget and think about what life is going to be like for me in a few months."

"event","Well I have been feeling really stupid lately because it seems that no matter what I do someone can do or does it much better.  I know that perhaps its just me, which Im sure everyone gets into that kind of thing.  But about 15 mins ago I was asked if I could help solve a problem with some coding, coding which I can honestly say didnt look that formiluar to me.  I mean there were things here and there I recognized but for the most part I had to do what I used to do to learn code, play around with it then look at the results on a preview page.  Anyway, I read through it all more than once and my eyes skimmed past something that looked formiluar, which I noted in my mind was the problem.  I changed it around, checked it on the preview page, then did my happy dance.  It gave me a real boost.  YAY go me. =P"

"event","I just recently read my lovers live journal and after posting my reply I felt as though I needed a ranting session.  I feel him to be highly mistreated where hes working, dont get me wrong most everyone who works is mistreated, but there is usually some kind of line.  This is just ridiculous.  Talking to him as much as I do I feel I have a damn good idea on just how much he does for this company and I truly feel that without him they would be screwed.  Theres no one person who could do the amount he does in the time period they tend to give him with the amount he accepts for it.  But thats all okay because I know that there is something better for him and its going to come along soon enough.  When it does I hope Richard tells his boss where to go.
I hate when the people I care about most are being used or mistreated, its something that really rots me to the core of my very being.  As I was stating in my discussion with a few people I know not too long ago, everyone should be allowed to kill at least one person in their lifetime.  If not that then a murder should be treated as an offense and the murder should receive no more than a hefty fine unless it proves to be an ongoing thing. lol Im sure that sounds rather pleasing to a few people who read these babbles.
Well I have work to do and I will be receiving a phone call from my baby soon and I dont want any distractions while Im on the phone with him because I really want to be one to listen to him if he needs someone to bitch to.  I might write something a little later if I feel the need to type about something."

"event","Alright, seens how I have quite the headache I think I'll make this entry short.  Even though my head is killing me I am so damn amused, why might you ask, whats that?  You didnt ask?  Well too damn bad this is my journal and Im posting it anyway.  =P So first thing, in one of my classes there was a pants pulling incident where this disgusting human beings pants were pulled to the floor.  And of course knowing my luck I turn around to ask a friend a question and was ""lucky"" enough to see it.  Oh dont get me wrong it was great amusement, but damn sickening all at once.  Second a girl in another class was sneaking grapes from a container in class.  The teacher didnt say anything so I guess she thought ""oow Im getting away with this, sweet deal"".  So she ends up taking the whole stem of grapes out to make them easier for her to get to and a guy beside her makes her laugh.  She drops the grapes on the floor and says ""oh piddle"" in a calm voice and then ""look what you did, you made me cuss"".  Well I broke into hysterics right then and there and with that most of the class did as well.  Her face went red and suddenly possessed a look of confusion.  I mean piddle??? Thats just rich.  
Anyway the screen is killing my frontal lobes right now.  Perhaps Ill post again later."

"event","As I sit here waiting for Richard to call me I feel an overwhelming sense of helplessness.  My lover is suffering in someway internally it seems and I dont seem to be helping much.  I wish i could take it away and bring it into myself where he would never find it nor have to worry about it ever again.  I would do anything for this man, this love of mine.  I dont think he realizes how much I love him and how much he means to me.  I hope that one day he will see it and feel it projecting from me harder than the waves of the ocean that beat against the rocks down by the shore.  My heart aches for him, my hands ache to touch him, and my lips ache to kiss him.  
Another upsetting thought is the fact that perhaps when I get there I will still be just as helpless as I am now.  But time will tell me the answer to that possible future.  However I really dont see that happening, I feel that Richard and I will be very happy with eachother and physical touch can cure a lot more than most people think.
I will love Richard longer than death, far longer than time and my love will exist for him even when the earth casts its last grain of sand into the never ending void we call space.  Even if our paths separate later in life (which I doubt) I will still love him always and forever.  This is true, and true love can never be broken, it lives within you even if you dont want it to.  One day he will see all of this, one day he will be truly happy and even if he becomes unhappy one day for whatever reason, when he comes home to me I will do everything in my power to ease him of it.  My love for this man is true, everlasting and one day he will know this all to be true.  I am never going to leave him, even if he wanted me to, physically I would go but spiritually I will always be with him and surround him, helping him to fly."

I am happy that lastnight was a total over reaction.  Richard made it home perfectly fine.  His phone died and he couldnt call me until he got home, he arrived home late because his pool game went on forever, as well as they had to call it a draw because no one was winning.  Ah well a draw is better than a loss right?  
I miss you baby. -=hugz and kiss=-  I hope your day is turning out good for you and I really hope you arent too exhausted."

"event","Here I sit, figgetting, chewing the sides of my fingers until they bleed.  My mind is filled with thoughts, thoughts which torture me so, thoughts that consist of the worst.  
Richard hasnt called me as he usually does tonight.  Hes not even online.  I know that it shouldnt be such a problem and I know Im a little obsessed and possesive, but this is different because Im filled with worry.  He went to play pool as he usually does on Tuesdays.  He usually calls me from there on his cell, and then calls me when he gets home, but as of yet no word.  I mean what if something really horrible has happened to him?  What if hes hurt?  Even worse what if hes hurt and theres no one there to know of it?  
Jesus I must be crazy to think and act this way.  Is it really so bad?  Do I just care too much or am I mentally unstable?  I wish I knew, I dont know much of anything right now only that my lover seems to be missing. :(
Or perhaps hes having fun with a lady friend. >.< My god thats harsh, why do I think like this?  Is there anyone who can tell me why?  Or tell me whats wrong with me?  Please Id really like to know.
I miss my baby, and Im so worried.  This is torture.  All I can really do is take the phone to bed with me and hope he calls eventually.  If he doesnt I dont know what I will think tomorrow.  I might call every hospital where he is or something. >.<  I almost feel sorry for thinking this way.  I just fear the worst.
Im going to end this entry now and go freak out somewhere while holding the phone and jumping every time it rings."

"event","My day started off horribly.  While I was on the bus this morning the driver hit a bump in the road and I was in the process of sitting down, so techniquely I was still on my feet, and I went off the floor just a little and gravity took its tole, considering I was tired as hell, and my elbow slammed down extremely hard on the window ledge.  Even though there was nothing sharp there, it was a blunt surface, it hit hard enough to bust the skin open.  So here I was bleeding from a flat surface as well as the bone was throbbing with pain.  I did however grit my teeth as usual and didnt open my mouth to complain or make much fuss about it.  What sucks about that is, you know when you stub your toe or something, and for some strange reason you tend to hit that same thing all throughout the day. >.< Yeah you get my picture Im sure.  You probably dont hit it any more than on a regular day, you just notice it more because of the sensation you get that you normally wouldnt.
Moving on, after that things started to look up for me, classes went well and I accually felt as though for once in a certain class I did well in my understanding of things.  Besides the way classes went, a good friend of mine came over today.  This is significant to me because she hasnt been over in over 3 months.  We had a good time, good laughs and were our crazy selfs as we used to be.  She just recently left and after all that hyper activity im feeling a little drained of energy, the screen appears to be sitting in an alternate reality or something.  Weird o.O
-=trips out in deep thought for a moment=-
While Kay was here I got to work on my journal and fix up its layout, of which I am very pleased with.  Also I got to speak to my lover Richard for a bit while I forked over my computer to Kay for a while so she could talk to her baby.  Everything seemed to work out nicely for me today, well everything but the abuse I received on the bus this morning, but hey you can never have too much good without a little bad right? 
So yeah, heres where I end this entry and get myself ready for another night of insomnia.  Perhaps Ill get more than 3 hours of sleep tonight. -=snickers=- yeah right, when have I ever been so lucky lately =P Sleep and I are not one it seems, we arent even only friends.  You know, its really not so bad because I get to speak to my Richard every night and my thoughts are always filled with him so even though Im not sleeping Im quite content to have him roaming my mind to keep me company.
I love you my baby. -=kissez and hugz=- =D"

"event","I feel like Im falling.  Slipping away, away from not only myself but the one who I feel truely loves me.  I reach my hand out and our fingers just barely touch.  Even so, its enough, enough to know hes still there.  Surrounded by this cloak I hear his voice and smell his essence.  
Perhaps Im not accually falling, not slipping away at all.  Even though it feels that way maybe hes accually holding me and Im just too blind in the dark to see him and too numb to feel him with more than my cold dead fingertips.  
My heart slows to a crawl when Im not talking to him, yet the thought of him keeps it beating enough to survive.  An obsession so foreign to me, to be so dependent on someone, to feel as though you would die without them is almost scary but at the same time wonderful to think that there is someone who can possibly mean that much.  The thought of loosing that is so terrifying.
Soon, sooner than I think, I will look back and see my strength buried in this somewhere.  I will see my patience, and I will see in the dark because Ill have my other half to guide me, for without it I will continue to wonder.  Continue to feel lost, cold, dead and alone.  I will truely be complete.
Soon."

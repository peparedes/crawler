"event","haven't done too well[for me] since my last post. today though i had some oatmeal cereal before practice, a bar during practice, and then 2 asian pears, a pear, soymilk, and a lot of water throughout the day. it's almost 6:20pm right now and there's no way i'm going to slip tonight. 
tomorrow i'm doing the same thing but only liquids after practice.
right now i'm working out my disgusting abs.
 
i think i'm finally doing it.

i can't WAIT to lose the weight!!!!

"event","honestly don't really want to talk about how i did today. from a realistic point of view, i did well. from my point of view or anyone else who's a MUCH BETTER deiter than me's point of view, i did NOT do well. so that's all i'm going to say. tomorrow i'm going to a banquet and my mom ordered me fish. healthy, but i'm not going to eat much of it and am planning on not having anything before or after that. ugh 

i'll let you know how that went later."

"event","ok so i've had soymilk, a banana and a fatfree powerbar today because of practice. only allowing myself soymilk for the rest of the day. i really messed up my left shoulder at practice yesterday and i'm going to see what's wrong with it later today. don't know if i can do anything at practice tomorrow which sucks.. but at the same time would be good so i didn't have to eat anything for energy. we'll see what happens."

"event","ok so today so far i've had a fatfree powerbar, propel, crappy tasting healthy cereal[hence the healthy lol], some almonds, a pear.. yeah i won't even go on. a small part of me knows i've lost weight like everyone says, and that i exercise a lot and everything i eat is very healthy but that's a tiny part of me. the rest knows that's way too much, i probably haven't lost anything, and that i'm doing terribly. that small part of me also knows that if i keep going the way i have been for the past couple of months i'll be a lot closer to the 'skinny' i want to be, in about another month, give or take. but i wish it came faster and i still want to be so much skinnier than what even eating riduclously healthy will ever let me be.

ugh i'm in a rut.
let's fast forward time."

"event","so i ate a lot[for me] today. my mom made me food and watched me eat it. it was all really healthy but that obviously doesn't make it ok since i felt fat all day from not feeling hungry. on top of that my mom is mad at me for who knows what right now and idk. i just didn't have a fantastic day.
tomorrow, i better not slip.

ugh hopefully tomorrow will be a better day..

and this is only the first day!
i can't wait to see what happens in 2 or 3 weeks!!

"event","helloooo everyone.
so i've always restricted myself but i've been on a really strict diet for about 2 months now but today is the first day of my dietdiet.
since i swim so much i know i need energy for that, so i'm allowing myself a small breakfast before practice and a bar during practice. after that i can have some fruit or organic/light soymilk but only that for the rest of the day.
I CAN'T SLIP!! i've slipped WAY too many times and it is NOT going to happen again!!

motivate me!"

"event","ok so it's my first time writing in my journal today. i used to have one but stopped it a couple of years back. anyway getting to the point- i'm so frustrated with myself!! i tell myself i'm going to fast food and only have water and maybe some organic soymilk all day, and then i binge at the very end of the day. ugh this ALWAYS happens!!! even though i binge really healthy food and i'm losing, i'm not losing fast enough. i need way more support so feel free to add me!!!!

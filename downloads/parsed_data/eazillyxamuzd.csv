He doesn't need that, i wish i could take his pain onto me.  i mean, i don't really want my parents to die...sometimes...but i would have rather have had one of my parents die instead of Al's.  

The wake for Al's dad is tomorrow night, for once i'm actually going to dress up all pretty and everything.  When i see Al, i'm going to give him a BIIIG hug.  god i hate seeing him go through this pain...i wish i could take it all away..."

"event","yea, so terrible things have happened this week...

i'm sure alot of you already know that wisconsin had 28 tornados on thursday, and stoughton got hit really bad...  well, earlier that day i was with katie, jason, and izzy.  and we were driving into sun prarie on hwy 151 and my back left wheel flew off my jeep.  so we were stranded on the highway with tornados going on.  we got a tow truck and my dad called and told me that Al's dad had died from the tornados.  it didn't sink in at first cuz iwas with my friends and everything so they took my mind off of it.  when we got to stoughton around 11:30 at night, roads were closed off and the tornados had passed, but there was no power.  katie and izzy stayed the night.  the next day i hung out with katie and izzy,we drove through stoughton, or atleast on the roads that weren't blocked off, and the things that we saw were just so terrible.  then i had to work.  and that's when it sunk in that Al's dad died.  i walked into work and i didn't talk to anyone, and Cory came into the back room and asked me what was wrong and i told him that i knew the person that didn't make it out alive from the tornados, so Cory hugged me.  he hugged me and later at work i started crying and Mike hugged me.  i got home from work and damon was mad at me for absolutely no reason.  he said that i should be along because i'm upset.  ummm last time i checked, when i'm alone and upset, it doesn't end up good.  so i went to damon's house without him knowing i was coming at like 11:15 pm.  i tried going my usual country road way, but a cop was blocking the road because of the destruction from the tornados.  so i finally made it to damon's and at first he was happy to see cuz i surprised him when he was sleeping.  but then he got pissed at me for nothing again, so i left.

that takes me to today...
i got a wristband so that i would be allowed in the parts that were blocked off because of the tornados.  i went to Al's house to help clear stuff out.  words cannot describe what everything looked like.  houses were totally gone, where there used to be forests, there's just snapped trees thrown all over the place.  Al's dad was crushed by their chimney.  Al's roof was gone, walls ripped off, a pine tree in his kitchen, and a big hole where their living room was.  that hole is where the chimney fell through and crushed his father in the basement.  i stood where he died just 2 days earlier.  my brother drove me there, cuz Al's my brother's best friend, and Al's a really good friend of mine also.  alot of people were there to help out with everybody's houses...or what used to be houses.  we cleared stuff that wasn't ruined from Al's house.  everthing was just...i don't know how to explain it...depressing, devastating, horrible, shocking, sad etc...  it made me want to cry just looking at all the damage that has happened to everything.  i just don't get it...why Al?  why did his dad have to die?  i mean, he was in the basement where he was supposed to be, but did that save him? NO.  Al is such a good person, i hate seeing him go through so much..  his house is gone, his dad's dead, and his mom's in the hospital.  i wish i could take the pain onto myself and off of Al.  i hate seeing other's go through so much pain, i jsut want to take it all of myself so that they don't have to go through it.

I talked to Al a little bit, he was laughing a little bit.  he was really stoned, but i would be too if everything i had was gone.

This sounds terrible, but i wish that the tornado had taken one of my parents, just so that i don't have to see Al go through so much pain.  

So on top of almost dieing in a car accident and the tornados and the death of someone i knew and damon being pissed at me and won't talk to me and doesn't want to see me...the past 3 days have been terrible...  i mean, my friend, Tony, is more greatful for me to be alive than my own fucking boyfriend.

mmk, but i'm done cuz if i keep typing about all of this, i'm going to start crying again..."

"event","yes so...today was interesting...  you all know about how me and damon took a break for 2 weeks, well, today was the first day that we saw each other since we broke up...

i woke up around 10 and got ready and wore my new skirt, and then at 11:30 my manager told me that i had to work at 11.  i got really pissed off cuz how was i supposed to know my schedule when the fucking schedule wasn't out when i went up north on thursday and i got back last night around 10:30 p.m. and i NEVER work on mondays.  so how the fuck was i supposed to know i had to work?!?  i was throwing shit around and kicking the walls and everything.  i had to text damon and tell him that i couldn't see him till i was done working at 3.

so after work i went to damon's, and we talked alot.  it felt so good for him to hold me again.  but he said that i couldn't kiss him until he kissed me grrr so i teased him hehe...  we weren't OFFICIALLY going out yet.  i dropped him off at the highschool for his football practice shit.  then iwent home and my parents were gone at the Mr. and Mrs. Smith movie, and when they came home they're like, ""oh no, why are you home? are you and damon not getting back together?""  i tried to keep a sad face, but i just couldn't hide mysmile.  then i told them that he was just at practice.

damon called me after practice and after he took a shower and i came over and we hung out for a bit and then we went to go see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  we walked into his house and his mom ran up and gave me a big hug, it was sweet.  and at 9:25 damon asked me out again (for those of you who don't know, me and damon started going out on 9/25/05 at 9:25) and then he kissed me.  oooooh i was sooo happy you wouldn't believe.  then we went to his house again and hung out, i stayed till like 12:45 cuz it was really storming out.

so yes, me and damon <33 are now back together and today was our 10 month anniversary, he made me feel sooo special today, words can't even explain.  i haven't been able to keep a smile off my face.  and i don't care what anyone says, I'M HAPPY.  if you don't like damon, well then i really don't give a fuck.  

well i'm going to go and watch some tv...g'nyte everyone..."

"event","yea so i know i haven't updated in a looong time, but i'm leaving for up north for a couple days and i just wanted to get a few things off my chest.  

well, i'm buying myself a laptop, it's $1,050 and very pretty.  i can get wireless internet on it, and it can burn, read, and write cds and dvds.  and i'm paying for it all on my own :)

alot of you already know that me and damon broke up...well...a two week break...

those 2 weeks are almost up (on monday i see him again), and all people can say is ""don't go back out with him"",  ""if you go back out with him, he can't come to your ""surprise"" b-day party"", ""fuck damon"".  and you know what?  all this shit is really starting to piss me off, i would have atleast thought that my closest friends could see how much good he's done for me.  i don't cut anymore, i'm not trying to commit suicide every night like i used to...ya know what?  fuck you all, fuck everybody...  i mean, i don't know if i'm going to go back out with him, but i thought that atleast my closest friend could be a lil more supportive.  and vogel hasn't even lived with me long enough to talk shit about him.  i don't even know if i wanna go to my ""surprise"" party.  if they're being dumb and saying that if i go back out with damon, then he can't come, i do'nt want to go cuz then they're obviously not real friends, and they're not trying to make me happy.  i think they just want to throw a party cuz they want to feel like ""good"" people.

people just fucking suck and i don't want to talk to anybody anymore, cuz everybody's just dumb...

but now i'm packing to go 5 hours up north till sunday, get away from people for a while..."

"event","today was just another dumb day at school.  after school, me and damon went to go pick up my cabinet thingy that i made in woods class at the woods garage doors.  then we went to go to my therapy session...bleh...then to piano and guitar lessons for me and bass for him.  then we went to damon's house.  damon went to go tal to his mom while i sat in his trailer.  i tried to call michy but she didn't answer =(  it seems that alot of my old friends are just ignoring me...  (don't worry, not you wifee *lick*).  i mean, i really miss michy, and i read in her livejournal about the fun times she has with brent, natalie, and demarlo, and i wish i could have fun times like that like i used to when i went to ALCS.  sometimes i wish i didn't get expelled from that school, just so that i could have stayed good friends with them...*sigh*...  sometimes i feel like i'm in a dream, and i will wake up and evertying will be back to how it used to be...  at my old shcool with my best friends, instead of how i am now with what it seems like no friends...   i've been hearing some things about certain people which is making me very very sad and i'm so retarded to have let it happen this way...

i sometimes wonder what my life would be like if i didn't get in a relationship with Damon...  would i be dead?  would i be with someone else?  would i have more friends?  would i be single?  would i be sane?  lonely?  sad?  what would i be like?"

"event","I'm so confused, i can't stop thinking about my dream last night...  i dreamed that me and damon broke up and he dreamt the same thing a couple nights ago.  and in his horoscope, it said that all of his deja vu's will come true...  he also dreamed that i would get in a bad car accident.  i don't know why, but i can't stop thinking about us as a couple, if we're actually going to break up.  i mean, lately i feel like sometimes he doesn't even love me anymore, and that's what i need, i need to be loved...i need to love...  i hate love and the way it tortures me...  i hate emotions, emotions that i shouldn't have.  i'm so jealous of some people, and i know it's not a good thing to be jealous of others, cuz i should be thankful for what i've got.  i'm jealous of how some people have the perfect relationships it seems, and how some people have so many close friends.  i just don't know how much longer i can take all of this, i just feel like running away, far far away.  maybe to Ireland, i mean, i am Irish and all.  it's always gloomy there, and i like gloomy days.  or maybe Seattle where my gay uncle and his boyfriend live, it's so beautiful there with the mountains all around, no bugs, not too hot of weather and not too cold like Wisconsin.  i just want to get away, i need to get away."

"event","soOoOo...today...i woke up around nine, it was nice laying in bed last night listening to the thunderstorm.  Last night me, damon, chad, krista, tim, brandon and some other kid went to go to The Longest Yard, it was fucking hilarious i thought.  i thought it was just going to be another stupid football movie, but it wasn't, it was so funny.  i actually laughed out loud, i hardly ever laugh out loud in movies.

anyhwo, today i took a shower right when i got up and i went to damon's <3 house.  we hung out for a bit and then we went to my house cuz damon had to type shit up on my comp for homework.  my mom made me go pick up subs from my work cuz i get a discount.  i came back and damon was still doing his report, so i played the piano for a bit and then i cleaned my room.  wow, it looks so much better, it was really dirty, i couldn't even see the floor before, i feel proud and accomplished for it.  then damon finally finished, and we went to his house, and it was really hot in his trailer, so we went into his house (where the rest of his family lives) and we fell asleep on the hammock in their basement, well, i did, i don't know if he fell asleep, bus i was pooped.  then i had to go to work, bleh, 4-8...  i got out late cuz i had to help aaron close.  so then i went to damon's and we hung out a bit and then cassie <3 called and we hung out from about 9-10.  she took me to get free custard at culvers yummmm.  yep...so...i got home and damon won't answer his phone, i think he might be sleeping, o-well, he'll call me when he wakes up in the middle of the night.  so i tried doing this extra-credit thing for IMP 2 even though i'm getting an A in the class or something.  But i got confused so i gave up...yep...i gave up...

i'm bored, there's nothing to do, there's no one online really to talk to.  everyone has a life, and no curfew unlike me...o-well..."

"event","so, today when i woke up i had to go help my grandpa to put in his pier in the lake....that was a blast...not...i'm afraid of water :/  then i went to chad's house around 1ish cuz that's where damon was, we went into a different room and i told him about my cuts and he got upset, not mad, just sad...i feel like a terrible person and a terrible girlfriend...so then after that i hung around with people there.  then i had to go to work, it sucked cuz it was warm in the back room with the ovens with my long shirt on that i wore cuz i'm stupid for cutting myself again.  then i went back to chad's after work and we hung out some more, then we went to Star Wars III, fuckin kickass movie, although it sucked cuz i knew who would die and who wouldn't...

after the movie got done, around midnight, i went to damon's trailer to drop him off and pick up his laundry, cuz he doesn't have a washer or dryer. 

and that leads me to now, i just got done smoking with my brother and vogel...

today damon asked if i was going to have a party for my birthday, and i told him that i haven't had a party since i was about 10, cuz when i wanted to have a party my parents told me that i didn't have friends, so i couldn't...and since then i've never had a party...it made me sad."

i got a job at Cousins Subs, come and visit if you like...

about a week ago i had forgotten to take one of my birth control pills, and me and damon thought i might be pregnant.  so i called my doctor and she said it'd be fine if i only missed one day.  that was a scary thought to be pregnant at the age of 16...

today i went to school and then i worked (i've worked everyday for the past 2 weeks straight, 23 hours last week and 24 this week...bleh), then i went to chad's house, cuz that's where damon was.  chad was having a party, it sucked like usual.  i've been depressed for awhile now, i do'nt know what's wrong with me.  and when i got home...bad time...i was doing sooo good for so long, and in an instant it was all erased...i cut myself...bad, i did'nt try to kill myself, just a bunch of cuts...  i hate myself,how am i going to tell my parents or even damon, i told him i'd try so hard not to cut, but i'm weak and pathetic, but hey, i'm stuck in this body for the rest of my life, so i might as well get used to it or die...

and today got off to a bad start too.  i was in the shower this morning and vogel started taking a shower when i was in my shower, so my water turned freezing cold.  i didn't get to wash my hair or my face.  so i got out of the shower and i turned the sink on niiiice and hot to wash my face so that he can have a shitty shower just like i did...BOOYA...

yesterday, damon came over and brought the blade movie and then we went to go pick up my vehicle from the shop, and then we went to fazolis (i love that place), and then we went to my haircut appoitment, after that we went to the mall to wast time before going to ""blade trinity"".  it was actually a pretty funny movie, even though it's supposed to be suspense or something.  and then we went to my house and watched ""soul plane"" (hilarious movie by the way) while i had a heat pad on my stomach and i fell asleep for the end of the movie.

blah...  i can't breath out of my mouth, because it feels like someone is choking me.  my nose is all stuffy, i have a badass cough goin' on.  i can't sleep for more than 3 hours a night.  my eyes burn.  i have cramps...  mmk i think i'm done bitching, wait... no i'm not:  vogel owes me 2 packs of cigarettes, because i gave him 2 packs in the past...grr...mmk now i think i'm done...  thank you for listening to me bitch..."

"event","ugh i already typed this shit, but my comp. fucked up and it erased it all!  die computer...

so yesterday i got done with work at 6 (damon and demarlo came to visit me =)) and i called damon while i was in the parking lot and he wanted me to stay at the mall for a while more until he got there, and i told him that i had to go home to give my mom the check card, and he made it seem like he was going to wait at chad's house for me so that he can pick me up and hten we can all go to a movie.  so i got home and i called damon and he was already at the mall and told me to drive tthere, and i told him that i wasn't going to drive 20 miles in the same direction i just came from.  so he was getting all bitchy n' everything so i hung up on him.  then i texted him ""i hope you have fun tonight"" and he replied ""don't blame this shit on me, i can't wait for you if the movie started in half an hour"".  so i sat on the couch in my room and watched tv, bundled up cuz the heater doesn't work in my room contemplating to cut myself, but my blade is now dull and not sharp enough to penetrate me skin and make me bleed, so i fell asleep.  and then i woke up to damon right by my side watching me sleep with a blade in my hand, he took the blade and set it down.  we talked for a bit and wathced tv for like 10 minutes and then he left to go to the bowling alley to pick up friends...  don't get me wrong, damon's a very nice guy...

today i woke up, went to work till 7 and michy and natalie came when i was finishing up and we went to taco bell and got FREE FOOD!  then i went to damon's house and i put his hair in little ponytails to dye the tips black (i gave him a haircut and bleached his hair a few days ago).  and then iwent home and here i am...  i was talking to michy and demarlo, but michy left me, so i'm just talking to demarlo...(thank you for the help and advice michy, and thank you for listening to me bitch, demarlo).

i'm so confused (michy, you know why)..."

"event","bad week...  well on monday in first hour i did an essay on my religion, wiccan, and my teacher said i had to do it over.  and he's like ""i know you want to do this niky""  and i was like ""no i really don't, why don't you just fuck off and mind your own business and let me do my essay on what i want to do it on""  and then i sat down and i had to think of something else to do my essay on and he told me ""niky just smile""  i gave him a pisses off look and told me no...so i sat there for the whole hour and i didn't think of anything so i jsut handed in my original one...

in all my classes, the teacher tells us to pick a partner to work with, but no one wants to be with me, the all ask me to move so that they can be with their friends...FUCKERS...

i've been really depressed lately and damon gets upset with me cuz i don't share my feelings and i don't tell him what's wrong.  and he stayed home sick on wednesday and i went to his house after school to take care of him and i got to his house and i went to his room and he was laying there on his bed watching star wars, so i layed on him and hugged him and tried to talk to him about my bad week so far and he just wanted to watch the movie, so i curled up next to him and fell asleep during the movie...  then later on i was trying to snuggle with him and and he just got up, turned on a lamp and sat on the floor... 

and tonight when i was at his house, i was really depressed and i was crying and he was getting upset and turned away from me cuz i wouldn't tell him what i was crying about, and then later on there was a mass confusion of things that i said a while back and he took it that i was lying to him when i swore i told him (i won't say what, it's personal) so he got really upset at me and i thought i had cried my last tear ealier, but i started crying again...  i just want him to hold me and tell me everything's going to be okay, when it's really not...  i don't know what i did wrong...i always fuck everything up...

"event","whoop whooop, HIO!  therapy was boring, we had a cookout in our tiny lil dog pen.  and me, nikki, karley, and corolla went to the gas station to get food and i bought a drink and then we went back to therapy and i didn't want my drink so i gave it to laine, and duane poored a shitload of glue in his drink, and then i took a drink to see if it tasted wierd and it was chunky and i spit it out on duane.  and laine drank the whole thing and never knew about the glue, it was hilarious but sick.

then after family night, me and my dad went to the mall and i bought pants and a shirt.  and when we were almost out of the store a chick told me that my skirt was coming unzipped lol, it was funny.  

i go in for surgery tomorrow on my mouth!  and then surgery on monday for my infucted toe!  wish me luck!

"event","yea so, i failed my drivers test, cuz the guy said that i didn't look cautious enough at an uncontrolled intersection...o well, i go to retake it on the 18th of this month...

my dad took me out driving today and he made me feel more like a failure than before...  i gave up on trying to figure out which parent i like better, i hate them both...  and psychotherapy didn't reduce my days at all at my staffing, so i'm still stuck there, i've been there for about 5 months, and people usually get out in about a month...*sigh*...

work was fun, it was my first official day on friday, it went pretty good, and michy came in and woudln't stop talking to me so i got in trouble for that...whatever...

me, katie, and michy are supposed to go to a movie today, but i can't get ahold of either of them...

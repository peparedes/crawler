I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase


When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts
My once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away
All the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase


I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

Andy- i love you with all of my heart n nothing less n no one could ever change that...you'll always been in my heart, no matter wut."

Leading you through the night
Sharing the smiles and tears you cry

For all the strength you need

For escape from the hopelessness

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
and I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah,
Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah
Ah-ah, Ah-ah

I walk alone
I walk a...

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a...

"event","Okay so i started reading this book called ""Slow Death"". its a true story about a man named David Ray who would kidnap hookers and bring them back to his trailer where he would abuse them sexually n physically. all while doing so taking photos, drawing pictures, and video taping it. its deffinately the most grotesk book of read. n to think that this is actually true. n sum of the things he did to those poor women is jus plain un imagainable...in one part he records himself saying wut he did to one girl. there was sum girl he used to work with that i guess was a whore n obviously she got around a lot...so he explained that one night they went out n she gave him oral sex n he ended up getting the clap(gunna have to look that up). then about 6 months later, after he had treatment, he invited her to his home, or ""toy box"" as he liked to call it, and he asked her if he could ""tie her up, slap her around a little n then fuck her"". her being the dumb blond that she was she said yes, but he was going to do more than jus ""slap her around"". he said that he strapped her down so it was physically impossible for her to move any part of her body, he had her tied up in a way that he could easily get in and out of her vaginal area, also her anus. he then said he put a massive dildo, that was so think no human hand could grasp it with one hand, inside of her butt. she screamed and screamed and tried to get free but he jus did it harder, he then said that he was ""horny as fuck"" n decided to finish her off by having ""normal sex"" with her. that part of the book, i think, was the worst thing i've herd but then again im only on page 64. 

its awful to think that there are sick people out there doing this to innocent people n its also sad to think of sum1 going thru that type of horror that you usually dont hear or see expect in movies. but this book is not based on a movie, its a true story n there really was a man named David Ray who would performe dirty sex acts on mostly women but also a few men.  

so ne wayssss...sum ppl r starting to get on my nerves...i tell ya. so far this semester is going pretty good n imma try n do better than i did last semester. n thanks to Jordan for doing my world geo h/w! lol k thats it...dono wut else to talk bout. leave a comment!"

"event","You screwed up...the worst you could ever screw up, well possibly not the WORST but it still made an impact. n for that you lost a very great person...a person you ""loved"" so much.  but u kno wut, i dont think you know the meaning of love...love isn't telling sum stranger they are attractive, love isn't giving sum stranger your phone number when you just met them that day. thats NOT love! what you did was down right stupid, there was nothing logical about wut u did. n for that you lost a wonderful person n i hope your happy...

So today we went bak to skool...IT SUCKED! i didn't fall asleep till 2:45 A.M. n then at 6 A.M. *sumone* called my cell phone. n today was SUCH a long school day...thank god i got done with all my homework n i can jus relax the rest of the day. in a way the break was short, but then again kinda long. it was short in a sence that we had skool today...but like last week when it jus started it felt long. but now its over so it sucks. 

i wish i could see the future..."

your lying...you've been lying for a long time...you've found yourself in a shit hole of lies. n the people you hurting dont deserve to b hurt, especially him. he gave you his love n trust n you continually break it. everytime you hurt or upset him, he falls into MY arms...not complaining about that, but its not fair to put him in that position. starting thinking about other people opposed to yourself, maybe you'll find ur way out of ur shit hole."

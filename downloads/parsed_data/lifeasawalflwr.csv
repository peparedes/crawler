"event","I guess I should thank her for her honesty.  I've always had an inkling with many different girls about why they each felt that ""they just didn't want a relationship"" with me.  I had always assumed it was because of what I lacked in aesthetics.  None of them ever had the balls to come right out and say it.  But she did.  So kudos for believing me when I said I was ready to hear what you had to say.  Folks, you know this is monumental because I haven't updated in god knows how long.  My lungs are killing me but all I want to do is sit outside in the cold and suck down a cigarette or two.  Maybe this will give me some motivation.  Or maybe, this will just stop me from trying altogether.  Who knows, right now its a 50/50 shot in either direction.  So stay tuned to find out."

"event","we had a party here last night with a lot of beer-- there were high school recruits present who were also drinking [not very much, we each had about one before we got caught]-- the RAs told us to dump it out and we were doing so, but they didnt know what to do about the HS kids who were here on a recruiting trip-- so they had to call the cops and the cops said if whoever threw the party was over 18, they'd be charged with endangering with welfare of a minor, serving alcohol to minors, and a host of other charges.  normally this would go straight to the JA which is fine, but no one knows whats gonna happen as far as the formal charges go.


so here i am, its 5.50 and I have a meeding with our RHD[resident housing director] at 7 pm.  With every passing minute, my heart rate increases slightly.  I really hope I don't get fucked.  Someone please keep an eye out for me."

"event","Ok so everything was going well in the city of Ithaca.  My roommate and housemate, Alex and Edward respectively, were headed home from Teagle[which is the gym].  We all felt pretty good as this was the second day in a row in which we all worked out, and were high on life.  We hopped into Alex's Ford Windstar and I call shotgun.  I think to myself, this will be a 2 minute drive through a college campus where the avg speed limit is 15 mph, so I dont put my seatbelt on.  As we're approaching an intersection, there is a Cornell Police car perpendicular to us.  After I laughed at Alex earlier for letting someone go at an intersection when it was his right of way, he decides to go first, instead of the cop.  It was all legal, we got there slightly before he did, but it could have gone either way.  Anyway, as we continue, we make a right turn and as we approach a bus stop, Alex pulls over.  I figure, he sees a friend on the street and is going to offer a ride.  Instead, I see sirens.  Alex didn't bring his drivers license, has an expired registration, AND a broken tail light.  I, as I said, didn't have my seatbelt on.  A long story short, the cop explains that Ithaca takes seatbelts VERY seriously and I am being issued a ticket valued anywhere between 35-100 dollars.  I will only find out the amount AFTER I plead guilty to the offense.  Alex however, gets a WARNING for all three of his offenses.  Granted, I'm glad he didn't get a ticket, since he was probably pulled over on account of me.  But really, 3 offenses, no dough, 1 offense, for the first time, 35-100 dollars.  What's the difference between me and Alex?  Alex is WHITE.  WHITE WHITE WHITE WHITE WHITE.  So I the sand-nigger gets the ticket, and the whiteboy gets of scott free.  Such is life.

Suck my dick."

"event","So I figure I should update because I am now two steps closer to completing my college shopping.  My cousin and I drove out to Huntington to get my Birks, which I am now proudly wearing while sitting at my computer desk.  I got the Arizona, mocha colored I believe.  I am very excited for their potential.  I also got myself a Northface jacket to keep me warm up north come the winter months.  In total I dropped around 295 bones on them, and then another 5 bucks to reserve me a copy of Halo 2.  I would say that today was a very successful day indeed."

"event","Ok so there have been several major events that have occured in the last few days.  The first of which was the end of high school.  I didn't stay all the way through til ninth period like I thought I would.  After 8th, I got bored of it and left.  I realized that the school wasn't mine anymore, at least during that time of the day.  For the whole year, my day ended sometime around noon, and I wasn't a part of the commotion involved when the final bell rings at 2:55 pm.  If I hadn't endured it all year, I suppose I didnt have much of a right to enjoy it on the last day of school.  It was a good day, overall, I'd imagine.  Teacher's who meant something to me let me know that I meant something to them, and the one's that didn't, well, didn't.  This isn't the time to kiss goodbye to all your friends, so I'm not particularly sad either.  We've got 60-some odd days according to the Class Of 2008 site for my school, and thats a long time to just be chillin.  I'm going to enjoy it, and hopefully if my cousin can come through, have some employment to pad the wallet and make me appreciate my time off some more.  It looks to be a promising summer.  My grandmother and her brother are coming to stay with us for the duration of the summer.  I love my grandmother and I'm going to thoroughly enjoy her cooking.  Her brother[my grand uncle?] is a really cool guy-- he's the type of Indian to be really into yoga and all that nonsense-- I think he and I are supposed to go on some trips this summer.  He's never been here before, so he'll be like one very excited tourist.  It should be enjoyable.  

The other big event that has happened is my acquisition of this fancy pants laptop that I'm currently communicating with you all on.  It's a Dell 8600 with ill upgrades and customizations made by yours truly, and I'm excited to be with it for the next few years.  Honestly, I'd make love to it if I could.  I can't wait til my next computer, because if this one is just so ill, I can't imagine what they'll come up with in the next few years.  I'm also looking to get the NEC flip phone, and a flat screen[not flat panel] tv for my dorm next year.  Mad shopping to do kids.  Not enough money to do it.  UNLESS I get this J-O-B.  

I've also been enjoying conversations lately with the fairer[aka weaker] sex ;)  

My new screen name is: like a jerk.

Off to the gym, to begin my pre-college renaissance.  Be easy."

"event","So today I got several things in the mail from the ""Bear Necessities"" web site, aka the Cornell store online.  I finally got my stickers for my car and I must say the rear windshield never looked so good.  My dad requested one from my cousin[who currently attends Brown University] for one too-- as a representation of the whole family, because he is my brother and he's like a second son to my parents.  I dont even care that the car is 10 years old, I never want to get rid of it now.  

On an even more sentimental note, I ordered three mugs from the same site.  One for my mom for mothers day that says ""Cornell Mom"" on it, and two others that say ""Cornell Grandmother"" on them; guess who those are for.  I'm also anxiously awaiting the arrival of a nifty had that I ordered from the site as well.  I am ultra stoked and am just feeling good about everything right now. 

I tutored, went to the gym, and I'm going to tutor again soon.  Even though I'm not doing any school work, my agenda for raising funds and self improvement is finally underway and I couldn't be happier.  Celebrate <3"

"event","Warning:  This is going to be an incredibly retarded entry.  And Erin Schaefer if you happen to read this, I apologize for my choice in diction.

So I was sitting in English last week[I've been mulling over this for a few days now, and I've finally gotten around to writing about it] and I was minding my own business.  Bobby, a former friend who formerly had credibility asks me:  Chandra, you growin' your hair out?  Me:  Yea, I guess... Bobby:  I think you should cut it.  So that douchebag things I should cut it.  We're not friends anymore, so why doesn't he realize that not only does his opinion NOT matter, but he's also not allowed to give me his impromtu opinion on ANYTHING anymore.  I don't go up to random people and critique things about them that I disapprove of.  Hell I dont even go up to Bobby and tell him to stop being a douchebag-- an urge I fight on a daily basis.

I like my hair at present and I think I'm gonna keep experimenting while I have the time and patience to do so.  So suck it.  And on a further note, I had a conversation with a friend who also spoke to Bobby[FYI, he got rejected from every college except SUNY Fredonia, and he got waitlisted at U. of Chicago and Sarah Lawrence] and she told me that they were talking about colleges.  She asked him where he was going and he said ""well, I got waitlisted at Chicago but they take a lot of people off their list so I'm probably gonna do there.""  Am I the only one who think's that is a crock of shit?  I mean, it'd be one thing to say ""I'm probably going to go to Fredonia but I got waitlisted at Chicago and I really hope I get in.""  Bobby is all talk and he can't back anything he says up.  He wants to sound impressive, and he thinks he's very qualified but the fact that he didn't get in anywhere makes things sorta self explanatory-- and I think its sorta pathetic for him to try and save face in front of this girl[who he hardly knows] by telling her he's ""probably gonna go to Chicago.""  [Tidbit:  Chicago's normal acceptance rate its 33% while their acceptance rate off the waitlist ranges from 3-11%, the average being 9%]  What makes him think that if he didn't make it through the first cut where the acceptance rate is near 33%, that he'll get in from a far more competitive pool where they acceptance rate is nearly 1/3 of the prior?  Anywho.

I'm in a good mood now and I had a thoroughly enjoyable weekend.  I saw Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 and I thought they were worth the money.  That's rare when you spend $9.25 to see a movie[yes its 9 TWENTY FIVE now].  I'm getting really excited for the summer to begin, however I have hardly begun doing any of the things I keep myself I should be doing.  My gym membership is sitting there, all I have to do is get started-- the first step is the hardest, and I dont know whats keeping me from it.  I'm getting out of school a little after 12 noon and I'm really starting to run out of excuses.  My mother is encouraging me to find a job-- this is a woman who had reservations about me volunteering anyplace.  So now I really feel like a putz for not being on top of anything at all.  Furthermore, I got a letter regarding Cornell's Prefreshmen Summer Program.  It seems really enticing because I guess you'll be able to meet people in a far more intimate environment and you'll spend the summer in Ithaca when its incredibly gorgeous.  However, I do feel guilty leaving home any earlier than I have to, and on top of that, the programs begin on June 2 or June 14.  Graduation for me is June 26 so I don't think I could make them :-/  

Alright, time for me to go back to my ""Prime time in the day time"" on TNT[I think Judging Amy might be on now].  Be easy niggas."

"event","I think I'm far too interested in Cornell's Class of 2008 website.  It feels like the first time I got a code to create an LJ Username and how I'd methodically refresh the site every twenty minutes to see if my last entry was worth a comment or not.  Just like now I check the Class of 2008 site to see how many people commented/viewd my thread(s).  There is a Welcome/Information session for the Cornell kids on LI at Jericho HS tomorrow and I told myself I'd attend, but I really dont see that happening.  I'm sure it'll be nothing more than an hour long masturbation seession about how great Cornell is and how great we all are for getting into and subsequently choosing to attend Cornell.  Granted I'm thrilled to go and all that jazz, but honestly, how many more times do we need to get congratulated about it?  Well I suppose a few more times couldn't hurt ;)  I'm speculating about my living situation next year-- I'm hoping that the townhouse will be worth it, and that living with a high school friend wont be as big a mistake as everyone says it will be.  Hopefully the fact that there will be two other people there will offset the negatives that people usually attribute to living with a friend.  

On a more useless note, I neeg to get into a regular sleep pattern again.  I find myself waking up at 6, only to sleep through my alarm, and rush to get to school by 7:55.  I come home at 12:34 or 1:21 and I eat my lunch and subsequently nap until 6 or even 8 in the evening.  Then I tell myself that I'll have plenty of time to do my homework because I wont want to go to sleep considering the nap I just had.  And I'm always wrong.  It's hardly 12:30 yet and I'm eyeing my bed.  The only reason I'm not in it right now is that there's something about an unmade bed that makes it somewhat less enticing.  The moral of the story is that I never get any work done and I sleep too much, which is a luxury I will doubt I'll have next year.  

I need to procure myself a job for the summer.  Get myself on a regular gym/running routine.  I also need to find a girl to spend the summer with.  It's all about self improvement for the next four months.  Hey, I mean I dont think there's anything wrong with me right now, but if I ever wanted to reinvent myself[or as Jay-Z would say ""please allow me to reintroduce myself..""] now would be the time. And if I wanted to do that, I'd want to put my best foot forward.  ie looking my best, and not getting stuck with the stigma that I was stuck with through most of my highschool life.  I'm not gonna lie, I sorta feel like Carrie from Sex and the City right now, typing on my laptop, semi-late at night, in my pajamas, reminiscing about my future and a dozen or so nonsensical ""what if's.""  And I'm not gonna lie again when I'm wondering if anyone from that website will actually find my profile on there enticing enough so that they contact me.  I'm sorta jealous that Eric Schafler has already been contacted, by a girl no less, named Lisa.  So good for Eric.  Boo for me.  

In any case, I think I've gotten over the fact that my bed's not made."

"event","its a new year gents.  it didn't hit me until i caught a glimpse of the tv just in time to count down the last 10 seconds of 2003 that.. well, it was 2004.  Ever since i was little, i looked to '04 as a special year.  I would graduate motherfucking highschool in 2004.  Being around mostly college sophomores last night kinda subdued what i was feeling.  apparently this whole deal is anti-climactic, but i still have hope that it will prove to have been worth it.  i can say that im comfortable with the ways things are now.  im not in a particularly great mood right now but i like my self control to not write about it in this.  the party was good fun, reminiscent of two years past.  it seems like so long ago.  that night was a night of firsts.  and there have been many firsts in the years since then.  im not going to continue and objectively comment about what my journal entry is or isn't going to be.  like saying ""this isn't going to be some long philosphical tirade.""  and the like.  i got home at 3.30 this morning.  it wasn't half as bad as i expected it to be.  2003 was slightly worse than 2002 but 2004 does look promising.  things with family and friends are beginning to solidify.  i'm amassing a collection of xbox games which i am proud of-- i never used to buy games, even if i did own a relatively new system. 

anyway.  here is to friends new and old.  here is to family.  here is to my slammin videogame console.  and here is to you for meaning enough to me to make me feel this way.

good luck everyone.  and happy new year."

"event","well i havent updated in a while.  thats partially because i havent felt this way in a while.  although, i must say, it does have some level of farmiliarity.  maybe im meant to feel this way perennially. to remind me of who i am and where i belong. to remind me of my place. 

looking at it from far away, im being ridiculous, considering my own circumstances that she doesnt know about.  but im not looking at it from far away, im looking up right up fucking close and its destroyed my insides. i feel betrayed by you. i want to hurt you, but i know that the worst i could do to you would hurt me far more. i hate the fact that i dont have power. especially in this fucking situation. i feel like i want to vomit. i havent gotten THAT feeling since a faithful overcast afternoon several years back. very few if any will know what i found out on that day.

i want to not feel outdone. why am i not good enough. ive been a consolation prize and until now ive been pleasantly ignorant. now i know how you feel, how the things you say to me are verbatim to what you say to him. maybe you say them to him first.. and just echo them to me. maybe im not special the way you say i am-- maybe you're lost in who you're talking to, you think you're talking to him, and it slips and you say it to me.  oh well no harm done, you gotta keep me happy. fuck you for making me think im special. 

time to move on. krock is awful at night. the yankees lost. big surprise. i still feel like vomitting, 20 minutes after i started writing this worthless entry. in other news, i finished my yale application.

its always sad to announce the death of a friendship. but tomorrow, there will be a murder. so say goodbye."

"event","so well its sunday morning and im sitting in this shit infested room of mine <img src=""http://12.236.200.29/IMG_0893.jpg"" alt=""title or description"" /> 
by the way, im in california in this really nice little neighborhood thats all family oriented and quiet and beautiful and well i just want to shit all over it and watch it turn into something more picturesque like the scene down on 24th and mission... right outside the mc donalds and bart station. yeah, i want this little gated community of mine to have some crack dealers on the sidewalk and some bums sleeping on the mcdonalds playground equipment. i wanna see the old lady at 36 west gate walk outside her house and find used hypodermic needles all over her beautiful lawn and some thoughtfully placed forty bottles left in a circle around her front stairs. i wanna see the the Millers across from me poking homeless men with their canes as they try and walk to their car when leaving for church in an hour. well this is my second camel light since writing this update. i think everyone should smoke because its meaningful and beautiful especially when you get older and become one of those ugly fat bitches in moo moos and your nieces and nephews call you auntie HOO HOO and your fingers are charred black like your lungs and for dinner you eat a pot of beanie weenies which consists of two cans of pork and beans and one pack of 99 cent MEAT MARK down SPECIAL OF THE DAY hotdogs and your pack of BASIC NON filters because they are the cheapest and its all you can afford now that your house is in foreclosure and your fourth husband has died. by the way fuck social security because they found out just last month that harold, your most recent deceased husband was actually dead and all the money you have been collecting off his sorry ass now needs to be repaid with a 7% interest. that or jail. one day life will be like that for me but not today so ill light up another and bitch some more. today after asking my mother why she is a cock sucker while she was sleeping she responded with I DON'T KNOW I JUST AM. and then asked me nicely to turn off the lights which i did until i decided i was hungry and she needed to wake up and make me breakfast. i am the breadwinner of this family the least she can do is cook me up some greasy ass bacon and some fucking hash browns when i tell her to. she obliged so there was no elderly abuse going on in the house this morning. i don't know about later though, she might put up a fight about dinner. in other news i entertain myself during the day by calling various companies and telling them I have not received my package in the mail or my delivery so on monday i should have my 24 case of sierra springs water the 16.9 fl oz and the san francisco chronicle for the last 4 days. why i do these things i dont know i guess partly because it makes me feel professional to lie on the phone and see what i can get for free and partly because it keeps my mind off things like how bad i smell and how much i could use a shower. maybe i should explain something for those of you who are a little bit confused right now. 

actually strike that thought i have something else to talk about. it seems that lately i cannot fall asleep with out participating in the following ritual: roseanne marathon on nick@nite and plenty of these <img src=""http://12.236.200.29/IMG_0891.jpg"" alt=""title or description"" /> 

SIDEEFFECTS: dry mouth, suicidal thoughts and breast enlargement.

anyway its time to go to church and this wonderful painting ive done should show you just how much i am commited to God <img src=""http://12.236.200.29/IMG_0892.jpg"" alt=""title or description"" />

"event","its a specifically hindu belief that if you die, you will become reincarnated and, depending on your kharma for that life, will move up or down the caste system.  once you reach the pinnacle, or the 'brahman' stage, the next step up is moksha.  that is the end, you are in heaven, you are enlightened, you are free.  they say those that leave us at a young age have fulfilled all of their good duties for a lifetime, and they are free from suffering from the remainder of mortal existance-- free from the suffering from our world.  these people, whose character and behavior towards others were so profound and beyond their years, have done more good to their fellow man than most people do in a lifetime.  and as a result, they are rewarded.  thats what the hindus say.  i hope that its true.  i hope he is free of suffering... free of pain.

you are in my thoughts and prayers."

"event","I just read through a plethora of my old livejournal entries.  There's some crazy stuff in there, let me tell you.  Entry after entry consisted of some mindless, heart-wrenching banter about who knows.  There were some repeat offenders but usually, they were about the flavor of the week/month/day.  I find this happening a lot-- I'll read something or see something that sorta inspires me to start writing, but about 4 sentences into the entry, I'll lose interest or lose motivation.

But what I'm about to say should pretty much sum up what I'm feeling.  On August 16th last year, I said ""I wish I could just fast-forward the next 12 months of my life.""  Well, here I am 12 months later and not much has changed.  I'm still waiting for yet another year to pass, hoping for something better/different/new.  Anyways, this'll be my entry for the next few months.  Oh, and wish me luck during the next year.  Cross your fingers.  And I'll see you all again in about.. 4 months."

"event","at risk of sounding totally snobbish i dont think i should say what i got on my sats.  but i can say that im not satisfied. and that i'll probably end up having to take it again.  i called my dad this morning on his way to work, and all he said was ""oh.. well, do what you gotta do,"" in reference to my retaking them.  i dunno, i was at least hoping for some ""you did your best"" or ""im proud of you"" but thats just not my dad.  not to say he didnt feel it, i mean, i probably caught him on a bus in front of a bunch of people headed to 179th street.  i didnt do poor enough to get this sinking feeling in my stomach and i didnt do well enough to be happy about it.  im right in the middle and this veritable purgatory is toturous.  i am going to the gym to get out some of this non-feeling.  i was planning on working out some agreession if i did poorly or working out of elation, but i guess i shitted all over that idea.  peace out niggas."

"event","a lot of stuff that i've seen said/written on lj lately has scared me.  this will be the last you will be hearing of other journals on mine.  i am currently not feeling particularly well.  thats what multiple hours of tv and frozen pizza will do to a guy.  ive got the first of three mini math tests tomorrow, ive gotta do four bio essays and the hw from last friday, and study for my sats which is this saturday.  its currently 10.57 according to my computer and i dont think any of that is getting done tonight. i can feel my eyes tearing from the pain in my head. im sad and confused. and im starting to think that maybe i had been imagining this whole thing that has been going on. but ill be ignorant and accept the denial of guilt as innocense.  i think it is time for me to make a resolution. it is tuesday night, almost wednesday. from now til saturday, i will be hardcore. HARDCORE. you just wait and see. oh and saturday night, im going to overdose and die with all the celebretory drugs that i will be doing.  yizzah."

"event","i have been unmotivated to update my journal of late. i cant seem to figure out why. my words dont seem to flow quite as well as they once did. also, my ability to make a tremendous deal out of every little thing in my life has also dissapated, which is, i guess, a good thing. i just read a comment from my last, overdue lj entry, and i found that i use 'of late' far too much. thanks kaitlin [happy birthday] and eric. upon rereading this entry, i saw that i had used it in my first sentence. hurrah. its a beautiful sunday. saturday was productive, and today i got my hair(s)cut.


im tired of writing. people may think that things are pretty easy right now because of the fact that the content of my journal consists of critiques on my choice of diction and things, but i just realized that i no longer find this forum safe to put my personal thoughts on. thats not to say that i dont have things going on. actually, id rather it be the case, that i didnt have material for this journal. ive got the material, i just choose not to use it."

"event","a lot of shit is going on at the moment. i hope i can get through it all, because i really never had to deal with this much stress before. i guess, if i think about it, a lot of other people have it much worse off than me, but its difficult to remain in that frame of mind ALL the time. and i almost feel selfish when i complain and stuff because of it, but i guess human beings are just selfish by nature.

i just got back to my computer, and i realized that i hadnt finished this entry.  i am clean and showered now.  i lost my train of thought and motivation to continue to write.  i feel physically good at the moment.  but inside, tisn't the same."

"event","this feeling is bothersome. that is nowhere near the appropriate word to use to describe it. but my conscience for proper diction is not really awake at the moment. i cant help but feel overwhelmed, and almost out of place. like a little boy in a conversation where everything that is being said flies over my head like a frisbee thrown too high. i dont know what to do to move forward. is it wrong to make some sacrifices? maybe im wrong in wanting to break open a stone and find water. im obviously looking for stuff that doesnt exsist. and that is essentially setting myself up for failure. the funny thing is that i thought i would be able to much more clearly express all of the reasons why i feel like this, but i cant. i cant simply tell you why im feeling the way i am. i suppose its my own personal demons haunting me, telling me all these things i spend so much time convincing myself is not true. i guess i keep on wasting my time thinking about this stuff. letting these assumptions rule my thoughts and have these hypotheticals own my attention. everything seems to be going well. i tell everyone im dandy. and i am fuckiny dandy. so then why do i feel this way? i dont know, im probably making something out of nothing here, and i cant be satisfied with something good. but with every lj entry that some people write, im letting myself fall back into the trap where it will ruin my day. or my week. and will dominate my time while awake and asleep. this is some kinda of bullshit. and i wish i could write so that people would sit back and say wow. but i cant. it is nice feeling insignificant. and i guess its nice having this shadow cast over me. and now, lucky enough, im being reminded of it from all different sides. so that i never forget."

"event","i thought i knew better than to update my livejournal when i had any substantial feelings, at risk of some of the responses i may get, but here i go anyway. this seems kind of sick to me. thinking of this scenario. it also seems all too farmilar and i dont know what ive gotten myself into, nor what i should do from now on. i dont even know what the fuck it is that im trying to say here. no one will understand it, and the person that i want to understand it, wont realize that im talking about them and this will have wasted everyone's time. except for those of you who only read the first sentence, and then get distracted by more important things, ie the lint found in your belly buttons. the giants lost today. and i feel fucking second rate because of you. and i thought i managed to get passed this but i guess it still lingers inside. fuck the bitches man, and the government."

"event","it was raining all day yesterday. but as soon as i walked out of school, ready with my umbrella, the rain started to lessen. and as i kept walking, i could have sworn that i heard birds singing. maybe that was just my imagination. maybe it was just me romanticizing the situation. but the skies began to part and this orange glow began to protrude from it. i guess that all meant something. or maybe it was just the weather. i hope this vacation turns out to be all i hoped. but im sure it'll be disappointing. i started this entry many hours ago, but a movie and a south park episode later, im too tired to properly finish it. so here is where i leave you. unsatisfied, yet again."

"event","i guess this is the same old sob story.  but until this story ends, i think i'll keep talking about it.  my lj usage has decreased immensly, and that was in an effort to spare those of you who take 20 seconds to read my entries from any of the bullshit that i have to regergetate to the lj community.  i really want to be done with people who treat me badly.  as i look around the IMs flashing on my screen at present, i reaize that the tension in each of those conversations is incredibly prevalent,and completely unnecessary at th same time.  i dont need to be upset over these people.  i havent been upset over a 'girl' in a long time, but here is that feeling again, rearing its ugly ass head.  

seeing you on my buddy list taunts me.  i look down to my taskbar and see us not talking.  i dont want to force it, but im incredibly insecure, and i get this constant feeling that im just this little nuisance that follows you around.  that is not what i want to be.  i doubt that these thoughts have even crossed your mind, but they constantly run through mine.  i dont know why i create all these contorted situations in my head, but im almost positive that they are accurate.  i want someone who doesnt have to act diferently with me.  and who genuinely enjoys my company.  im through with fake obligatory friendships that i've strung along for years so far.  

i am so tired.  the amount of work i've been forced to do is ungodly.  it is thursday night and im beginning to wonder if any amount of repose will bring me back to full strength, or if i've done permanant damage to my body.  i dont know  how much longer i can keep this up.  i am getting bleary eyed as we speak, and i still have to read 40 more pages on the wonders of micro and macroshock.  i apologize for wasting a minute of your respective lives.  i must no finish calculating leakage currents and hope that i dont fall asleep face-first in a book while doing so.

i got a 1360 on my psats.

my mother is listening to abba's rendition of 'mamma mia.'

"event","At my old (and my brother's soon-to-be-old) school, they send a text message to a nomimated mobile phone number (preferably one belonging to the parent/guardian) asking why your child is absent. They also send messages regarding important events, such as the fact that your child's report is available for collection. When the system was first implemented, I was the only one in my family who had a mobile phone, so naturally I put my own number down. This came in handy when I got a text message on my mobile asking why I hadn't shown up to school when I was actually AT school. Cue running to the school office. <p>Anyway, so because all the messages are sent to my phone, it's up to me to send a reply back. Usually, this is what I send:
<blockquote>My son Michael x of roll class a.b was absent on 25/5/11 as I gave him permission to stay at home today due to the Athletics Carnival. Yours Sincerely, (my mum's name).</blockquote><p>Here's some messages I wish I could have sent:
<blockquote>My brother Michael x of roll class a.b. was absent on 25/5/11 as he couldn't be bothered to go to the Athletics Carnival, EVEN THOUGH IT'S HIS LAST ONE - EVER. Oh, and he isn't going to his formal either. WTF? Yours Sincerely, Wendy x.</blockquote><p>Or:<blockquote>My brother Michael x of roll class a.b was absent on (date) as he has gastroenteritis. Yours Sincerely, Wendy x.</blockquote> <p>Oh, wait. I DID send that one once, complete with the proper spelling of gastro! Only under my mum's name and he really DID have gastro. Hope the office ladies who were reading the messages enjoyed that excuse!"

"event","The voice is used to tell someone that you hate/love them. To yell at your family members. To ask your customers what they would like and to tell the sales assistant why you need to return what you just purchased. To argue a brilliant point and to gossip on the sly. To sing along to your favourite songs and to let out your frustration.<p>But if your voice can't do all that, then what's the point of having one at all?"

"event","Oh, R&ouml;yksopp. I think that anything you create is the bee's knees. The day you announce that you come to Australia will make me very happy indeed (and I will assume I have died then, because it feels like there's no way that you'll come to Australia while I'm still alive). Every time I'm required to fill out the favourite music/musicians/noises section in my profile, you are always listed first. But what's with the artwork for <i>Senior</i>?<p><center><img src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a1/Royksopp_Senior_Cover.jpg"" alt="""" /></center><p>It's the opposite of great. Is this the reason why no designer has yet to be credited with the design? The photo of the two of you as elderly people is cool, but what on earth is with the top and the bottom? Is the top supposed to be a chandelier? Crystals? It's the bottom that kills it the most, however. To put it bluntly - THAT FONT IS HORRIBLE. Now, I'm not a graphic designer (I leave that to my friends), but I do appreciate good album artwork - and good album artwork this is not. Leave the artist and album name off it (as is the case with at least half a dozen albums I own on CD), and it'll be fine. If you need to have the details on it, that's what stickers are for. To borrow from Robyn's <i>Don't Fucking Tell Me What To Do</i> (whose singing I loved on <i>The Girl and The Robot</i> from <i>Junior</i> and really, should be made into a SingStar song), that font is killing me. If you want to know how to do dark, minimalistic album covers, take a look at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://sleevage.com/pet-shop-boys-fundamental/"">Pet Shop Boys' <i>Fundamental</i></a>, as a Facebook fan of yours suggested.<p>That being said, I cannot WAIT for <i>Senior</i>. An instrumental album by my favourite duo? HELL YES!<p>Love, Wendy.<p>Personally, I don't think <i>any</i> album artwork of R&ouml;yksopp's could beat the amazement that I felt when I examined the CD of their second album (and my favourite album when I'm awake) <i>The Understanding</i>:

"event","Last Friday, I got dressed in order to go to the RTA with my brother to fix up his licence, which was claiming that he was two days younger than he actually was; why he didn't do this earlier probably had something to do with our parents. Went downstairs, only to find a group of my brother's friends at the door, inviting him to go bike-riding. He ended up going bike-riding, leaving me all dressed up and nowhere to go . . . Except to Parramatta. I had been meaning to go to see if there was a chance I could knock something off my uni booklist with the Borders 30% off one full-priced book coupon while it was still valid. So off I went by myself to Parramatta, and unexpectedly came home with the following (with italics linked to the product in question):<ul><li>A copy of <a href=http://www.madman.com.au/studioghibli/collection/cat-returns/ taget=_blank><i>The Cat Returns</i></a> on DVD from JB Hi-Fi. Last time I bought a Studio Ghibli DVD for $20 was <a href=http://www.madman.com.au/studioghibli/collection/totoro/ target=_blank><i>My Neighbor Totoro</i></a> in December 2007. I've been stalking JB Hi-Fi ever since, waiting for another Studio Ghibli $20 sale. Even so, I was THIS close to missing out on this sale, which ended on the 19th, since I hadn't stalked JB Hi-Fi in a while. I actually jumped up and down when I saw that the DVDs were on sale, which I'm sure looked very dignified. *laughs* I had put myself on a DVD ban since I was buying all these movies, but not watching them until much later. But for a Studio Ghibli sale? Like hell I was going to miss out on that!</li><li>Three Popular Penguins books. Original intention was to buy <a href=http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9780141194752/alices-adventures-wonderland-popular-penguins target=_blank><i>Alice's Adventures In Wonderland</i></a> (from the new set of 75 Popular Penguins for uni) with the 30% off coupon for Borders. The store computer said they had two copies, but neither I nor the sales assistant could find a copy. Same with a Nietzsche book (difference being that I looked for it myself without any help, and there was only one copy). The sales assistant said that they only got six titles from the new collection in, which I thought was pretty hopeless. Later wandered into Dymocks to see their Popular Penguins range - way more impressive than  that of Borders! They seemed to have every single one of the 174 titles in stock, including <i>Alice</i>, <a href=http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9780143204879/playing-beatie-bow-popular-penguins target=_blank><i>Playing Beatie Bow</i></a> and <a href=http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9780141195148/dangerous-liaisons-popular-penguins target=_blank><i>Dangerous Liaisons</i></a> - all from the new collection of 75 titles and the latter two being on my books wishlist. With Dymocks offering a  Popular Penguins tote bag with the purchase of three titles, I gave in, bought them - I REALLY wanted that tote bag when I saw it on the front cover of the latest Booklover magazine - and subsequently broke my book ban (which was imposed for the same reason as the DVD ban). But it was totally worth it for the bag. *dances*<p><center><img src=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/blue_hippo/IMG_3325.jpg></center></p></li><li>A packet of tissues. I was walking back to my car when I saw a giant liquid dispenser: <p><center><img src=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/blue_hippo/16072010001.jpg></center></p><p>COOL! Not so cool when it turned out to be advertising Lifebuoy, which I swear has suddenly exploded onto the market; I'd never heard of the brand until a few months ago. I wasn't going to say no to a free packet of tissues, though. (I was expecting a hand wash or a hand sanitiser when the lady said 'free samples'.) <p><center><img src=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/blue_hippo/16072010002.jpg></center></p></li></ul><p>One thing's guaranteed - I sure won't be buying any more books or DVDs for at least a month . . . </p>"

How can you respect someone who just drives in without checking to see whether anyone's waiting for that spot?

Marion was bad enough, but to see Jonathan - who, after Marion left, was the best cook left in the competition - go in the next elimination, made me depressed, considering he was my favourite.

All but three were purchased - <i>Indulgence Petit Fours</i> and <i>Indulgence Slices</i> was given to me for my 21st birthday by my cousin Jenny and <i>frankie Magazine Afternoon Tea</i> was given to me (also for my 21st) by Stephanie. Thanks Jenny and Stephanie!<p>Anyway, I wanted to talk about my latest acquisitions, <i>Indulgence Coffee</i> and <i>Indulgence Chocolate</i> - perfect timing for Winter! Not that I'll be making anything . . . <p><center><img src=http://www.murdochbooks.com.au/indulgence-coffee-9781741965148.jpg> <img src=http://www.murdochbooks.com.au/indulgence-chocolate-9781741965155.jpg></center></p><p>How is it that an Australian produced book is cheaper overseas?! I noticed that both books were available for pre-order for only $8.11 each, so I pre-ordered them before the price went up . They go for $29.95 each in the bookshop! $60 worth of cookbooks for $16! Delivered right to the door  too, unlike the guy who managed to shove my cookbooks in the mailbox last year, which meant a couple of minutes trying to extract it from the slot, since it was too large to fit through the mailbox's door. Yay for the Book Depository! If only they weren't so sneaky with different pricing for different countries . . . <p>By the way, if you haven't read <i>Azumanga Daioh</i>, <a href=http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780316077385/ target=_blank>go and read it</a>. It retails for $40 here. It would have cost me $60 for the above volumes if my friend Julie didn't buy me volume 3 for my birthday in 2006. $26 is cheap! <p>P. S. There's a <a href=http://secure.morrisonmedia.com.au/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=2&products_id=82 target=_blank>new <i>frankie</i> cookbook</a>. <s>I want it</s>! (Edit on 25/5/10 at 17:59) I have it! Thanks for agreeing to buy it for my birthday, Fiona! *hugs*"

This Sunday is the Sunday when the Sydney Royal Easter Show Guide is out in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> and I get <i>very</i> cranky if I don't have my guide. Now I have to go to the shops to buy a copy, something I haven't done since 2007. (Yes, really - I've had free copies of the <i>Telegraph</i> delivered to my house for the past three years.)<p>Also, this is the second time in a fortnight that the newspaper deliverer has failed to deliver my newspaper on Sunday. If this happens again next week, I'm calling the subscriptions department to make a complaint.<p>Edit at 11:30: they better deliver the newspaper next week - there's a part two to the Easter Show guide, which is the Showbags and rides part."

Two of those are the Moonlight Cinema and the St. George Open Air Cinema. The difference between the two is that St. George Open Air Cinema is more expensive as you actually get to sit on a chair (I think; I've never been to a session), whereas in Moonlight Cinema, you sit on the grass. <p>I'd always wanted to go to one of these outdoor cinema sessions for a few years. I remember trying to get Margaret to come with me to some movie once, but she wasn't interested. Last year was the year I finally got to go to a session - Moonlight Cinema (which for Sydney is held in Centennial Park each year) was holding a preview session of <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i>, two days before I was due to leave the country. A perfect way to spend time with friends before I went overseas and at the same time, show Emin (who was visiting us from Singapore) what you can do on Summer nights in Sydney. The only slight problem was that it fell on Margaret's birthday, so by inviting everyone to come along with me, I squashed any plans she had for the day. Luckily, she didn't mind, as long as I came to her birthday party the day after wearing a Santa hat. <p>The experience was quite cool, both figuratively and literally. Figuratively 'cause it was awesome sitting on a picnic blanket (thank goodness for Country Road tote bags!) with everyone, talking in the open air while waiting for the movie to start. Some people brought wine and food, making it more picnic-like, while others brought blankets (which proved to be handy later). You could rent these lounge things to sit on, if you wanted. Fiona picked a great spot to sit down (as you can see above; the tree branch frames the screen perfectly) at the back, with the toilets not too far away. We were on a slope, so we didn't have people's heads blocking our views. Literally, because it was FREEZING for a Summer night. And it sprinkled a little while we were watching the film. Margaret was my saviour for the night because she had a cardigan that she lent me, which I believe prevented me from getting sick the next day. (I love you, Margaret! Don't worry, I have my own lightweight cardigan now.)<p>The film? Brilliant. A few sceptics were among us 'cause they weren't impressed by the trailer, which we saw when we were watching <i>Where The Wild Things Are</i>, but they enjoyed it  (I think; I know Margaret did 'cause she was gushing about it after the film). A bit fast paced for me - they seemed to shove the entire novel version in a really short space of time, and added a beginning and end in the space of ninety minutes. Nonetheless, I really liked it and hope to add it to my DVD collection one day. The trailer may not impress most people, but if you watch the film and STILL don't like it, I'll eat my cardigan. <p>I'd love to go to Moonlight Cinema again next Summer. It makes a nice change from watching a movie in an enclosed space. Yeah, the weather was a dampener (I love my puns), but it made a nice change from sitting in an enclosed room with a bunch of idiots who take photos of their feet in the middle of the movie such as when we went to watch <i>Where The Wild Things Are</i>. <p>P.S. There was a fight between some passengers who left the bus a few minutes after we got on. Made the more entertaining due to a on-board passenger calling 'Scuffle!' as they began fighting outside. <p>Yeah, my blog posts are a bit outdated. Lots to post about, including my trip to Malaysia and Singapore, my new mobile phone and random bits and pieces. At least it'll be a useful procrastination tool. *shifty*"

How can it be when dimwitted deliverymen shove your books into your mailbox, despite it being wrapped in cardboard and the fence holes not being wide enough to insert picture books flat? This time however, my most recent experience in getting them delivered is a happier one. I ordered two picture books from <a href=http://www.play4me.com.au/ target=_blank>Play4Me</a> for uni on Thursday the eleventh, and the following Tuesday, they got sent out (along with Anh's birthday present, which I had ordered the week before the eleventh). While Anh received her present on Thursday, I didn't get my picture books until Friday. But I didn't mind much, because they were delivered how they should be delivered - by the deliveryman walking up to your front door with your packages. It was the same person who delivered <a href=http://seunjinbing.livejournal.com/139852.html target=_blank>my CD from Juno</a>. He gets kudos from me because he closed the gate properly, unlike most deliverymen - if you don't close the gate properly, the electric gate will smash into it when I use it later. Helped that the padded bags used to ship my books were too big for my mailbox. Love the way my books get packed by Play4Me and <a href=http://chaos.com target=_blank>Chaos</a>; wrapped in bubble wrap before being inserted into a bubble bag/padded bag. Their customer service is pretty good, too. <p>I hope my Book Depository order will be delivered in the same manner, when I get around to ordering it (why didn't I order it when it was under ninety bucks?!). You think they'll respond to my request if I ask them to put Do Not Bend on it? I don't trust Australia Post."

"event","<center><img src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2800/4365745591_067755fc37.jpg></center><p>When I studied Children's Literature last year, one of the books we read was the first book in the Ranger's Apprentice series by John Flanagan. I really liked it, so towards the end of the year, sought out the rest of the series (there are nine books so far). The only problem? They had refreshed the first eight books with new covers to match the ninth book. As my copy of the first book was the old cover, and not being able to stand books that don't match, I hastily began my search of the old covers. (Luckily no one responded to my request for these books as my birthday present!) I could have just bought the new cover of the first book for $5 (which I think is an excellent way to encourage people to start a new series), but what would I do with two copies of <i>The Ruins Of Gorlan</i>? And I wouldn't have been able to score one of the best bargains of last year had I bought the new covers.<p><lj-cut text=""November 2009""><u><b>November 26</b></u>
Armed with a Dymocks gift card in time for their Booklover Shopping Event (thanks Julie!), I deliberately  planned my trip to the city with my friend Julie (not the Julie who gave me the gift card; that'd be my cousin) so that it'd be on the same day, where I could go to five Dymocks stores (if necessary) to get the books I wanted. My plan of attack was to start outside the city with the Broadway store, before making our way up George St into the city. Luckily, the books I wanted were found in the first two stores I went to, but I ended up going to three 'cause I wanted to check out the range in the main city store.  The two books I wanted were <i>The Burning Bridge</i> - the second book in the Ranger's Apprentice series and <i>Twitterature</i>.</p><p><b>Dymocks Broadway</b>
This went off to a brilliant start. Couldn't get in the damn store, for one. Julie and I used the escalator entrance, only to find that the gate was locked! Apparently the staff knew had no idea where the key to the gate was, according to the girl who was already stuck at the top of the escalator. To make things worse, there was no way we could get down, because there was only one escalator, and that went up. In the end, we all ended up going back down by pressing the stop button on the escalator and walking around to the main entrance, which was on another level. Memo to Dymocks Broadway: leave a note next time, yeah?</p><b>Result:</b> They had <i>Twitterature</i>, and book five of the Ranger's Apprentice series with the old cover. Really wanted <i>The Burning Bridge</i>, and I was sure <i>Twitterature</i> could be found everywhere,  so didn't end up buying anything. They also have a lot of Studio Ghibli DVDs. Store was pretty quiet.
<p><b>Dymocks World Square</b>
Had no problems getting in; there was only one entrance. Very quiet, as with the Broadway store. Kudos to their staff for knowing that the latest book in the Ranger's Apprentice series just got released. No kudos towards the lady who served me who forgot to knock $5.50 from my Booklover card, despite my asking her to. Luckily I wanted to buy something else.</p><b>Result:</b> They had the edition of <i>The Burning Bridge</i> that I wanted! They had <i>Twitterature</i> as well.
<p><b>Dymocks  424 George St (aka the main city store)</b>
This was PACKED. A sign advertising their 20% off sale (unlike the other two, which kept it a secret, prompting me to ask the staff in World Square whether they were participating), celebrity signings, free food . . . I've always held a soft spot for the main city store as I've gotten lucky twice when buying something there - the first time was when they had a three for two sale, and instead of giving me the cheapest book for free ($8), they gave me the most expensive book instead ($20), and when I asked about it, told me to keep it quiet. (I think it was 'cause that was scanned last rather than first. $36 worth of books for $16!) The other time was when I had to return $50 worth of books so I could use my $6.something on my Booklover card (the lady didn't ask if I wanted to use it and I assumed that all staff did it automatically for you). Instead of earning $43 worth of Booklover points, I earned $92 worth of points. SCORE! They usually have the books I want, too.</p><b>Result:</b> But not today. They had the entire series, alright - with the new covers. Don't you hate it when publishing companies decide to switch covers halfway through a series?  (According to the official Facebook page, they ran out of photos.) Ended up buying Twitterature here; cost me $2.02 after applying the 20% discount, the $6.something left on my gift card and the $5.50 from my Booklover card.<p>Mission accomplished!</lj-cut>
<p><lj-cut text=""December 2009""><u><b>December</b></u>
Now that I had the first two books, it was time to concentrate on getting the rest of the series. In point form, here's what happened:
<ul><li>At the end of November, I tried to order <i>The Icebound Land</i> (the third book)  from Big W Entertainment, since I had a $5 gift voucher, they were the cheapest and were offering free shipping. Unfortunately, they couldn't fulfil my order  and gave my money and gift voucher back.
</li><li>Ten days later, I discovered what might be my bargain of the year (apart from my cheap Moleskines from The Book Depository) - books five to eight, with old covers, in a box, on clearance from Target, FOR FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND EIGHTY-NINE CENTS! Each book retails for $16.95! I could NOT pass the opportunity to snap it up! I didn't want the box, so I discarded it by sticking it in the recycling bin. Now, they're being sold for $10 a box. Excellent, <i>excellent</i> bargain.</li><li>A few days later, having suddenly found myself in the possession of two more Dymocks gift cards (one courtesy of Emin; thanks!), I purchased the fourth book, <i>Oakleaf Bearers</i> from Dymocks Liverpool, effectively making it for free. I got the lady who served me to check whether it was possible to order in <i>The Icebound Land</i>, and it was, but unfortunately, I wouldn't be in the country much longer.</li><li>So with that in mind, I asked my cousin Jenny if she could buy it for me when Dymocks had their 20% off sale after Christmas while I was overseas. Had I known that Borders in Queensbay Mall, Penang had <i>The Icebound Land</i>, I wouldn't have asked her to buy it. *laughs* So when I saw it, I sent a text message to her asking whether she had bought it. She had; a Dymocks guy somehow managed to find a copy somewhere. A bit bent, but I didn't care, so long as I didn't pay RRP for it. That's all eight books done and dusted! Unfortunately, until I got back home, I couldn't start reading the third book, and thus, the rest of the series . . . Typical that the next book I wanted to read turned out to be the most difficult book to source.</ul></lj-cut><p><lj-cut text=""February 2010""><u><b>February</b></u>
I went and used a Target gift card I had on the ninth (and latest) book , Halt's Peril. I still have $8.10 left on my Dymocks card from Emin; might use that on the tenth book should it be out come this year's Christmas shopping event. Either that, or a Popular Penguin from the third collection to be published in July.</lj-cut><p><b>Tl; dr:</b> I got my old-cover Ranger's Apprentice books - all eight of them. Four for less than the price of one, two with gift cards and one courtesy of my cousin who bought it for me when I was overseas. Score! Oh, and I bought the latest one with the new cover as well."

"event","Seriously, I think Wi-Fi is one of the greatest inventions ever. You don't need a laptop to use it. You can use a mobile phone, a portable media player, anything that has Wi-Fi capabilities. Unlike a wired Internet connection where you must stay put, you can walk around and still be able to use the Internet, so long as you're in the network area. <p>Last year, I complained that the free McDonald's Wi-Fi service at Westfield Penrith Plaza was crappy. It could be that store only, for I find that the services of the Centro Roselands store and the Westfield Parramatta Level 3 and Level 5 stores worked brilliantly on my Nokia E63. I didn't drop out at all! And I didn't need to stand near the counter, either. The McDonald's window I used to log on kept popping up, which was annoying, but that was rectified by closing said window, which didn't interrupt my connection. Could even use eBuddy and send a few instant messages to my friends. <p>What I want to talk about in particular is the Level 3 store. Their Wi-Fi is so goddamn awesome that you can use it an entire level up - in the children's section of Borders Parramatta (which is on Level 4)! Score one for availability! That means that I could compare Borders' store prices to Borders' online prices via <a href=http://www.booko.com.au target=_blank>Booko</a>, if I wanted. I can check my e-mail in the (relatively) quiet children's section, where it's air-conditioned, while browsing children's books. If that isn't made of win, then I don't know what does. Maybe if it worked in the magazines section, but unlike the children's section, that isn't right above McDonald's Level 3 . . ."

I would have gotten it fixed back then, but I had assignments to complete. When my assignments were completed, I decided to wait until after I came back from holidays just in case of the Christmas season, where my laptop might be fixed in January, but not being home to get it back. I continued using the laptop by leaning the screen against the windowsill and plugging an external keyboard in as the laptop keyboard was too far to reach. <p>A week after I came back from overseas, I decided that it was time to get my laptop fixed, especially since my warranty expires on the 10th this month. Luckily, ASUS agreed via e-mail to fix it under warranty (you might not be able to get through on the telephone but their eSupport service is there as a back-up; responds in an hour or so; excellent) and on Tuesday, picked up my laptop, which I managed to close up to put in a box, and took it away to <a href=http://bpcomputers.com.au/ target=_blank>BP Computers</a>. They said that the person picking it would come in the morning, but he arrived at 1:30; I had fallen asleep by the time he arrived. <p>Spent the next few days surfing the Internet using a combination of my old laptop, which lags badly at times, but is still usable despite its age (five years old) and the monitor not working (plugged in an external monitor), and the Wi-Fi function on my new Nokia E63, which is how I once drained the entire battery in a day.<p>This morning around eight o'clock, the doorbell rang. It was a courier - with my laptop. How fast! ASUS's service is bloody fantastic! Definitely will influence me to select an ASUS laptop again should I need a new one; their laptops have a 24-month warranty. If only their batteries had a 24-month warranty as well . . ."

"event","Thanks for getting the regular newspaper deliverer back. Unlike last year when my paper didn't show up on Saturday half the time, my paper has consistently showed up on my front lawn nice and  early on Saturday morning, week after week after week. <i>Too</i> consistently, you might say. <p>Although my subscription expired on November 30, for the past three weeks, I have continued to receive my weekend papers on my front lawn, much to my surprise. <s>Unfortunately, this will mean an awkward phone call to your department when I ask you to</s> I have just discovered that I can suspend my delivery online! No awkward phone calls! But what is this? <blockquote>Subscription Term:  	Every 4 weeks - Direct Debit until you advise us to stop </blockquote> I certainly don't recall taking out a weekend subscription to your paper that'll be charged every four weeks! Is this why I keep receiving the paper? Are you going to charge my Debit MasterCard? (That's the last time I buy my Uni Card online if you do.) Or has some generous person quietly gifted me a weekend subscription for my birthday? I doubt my luck extends that far.  <p>But alas! I <i>will</i> end up having to call you. I cannot suspend my subscription online because you require more information. <blockquote>We require more notice of your suspension to process it online. Please alter your commencement date and resubmit or phone 13 66 66 to have your urgent request processed.</blockquote> Guess I shouldn't have left it so late. But on the other hand, I can try and get more information on this supposed weekend subscription . . . <p>So I called you. No human conversation, just a lady telling me what buttons to press on my handset. I have left it too late to suspend my home delivery on the date I desired. Apparently it should be done a week before you want to suspend it and not two days before, but this is the first time I have ever needed to suspend a delivery, so please excuse my ignorance.<p>We shall see what happens after January 30. If I find that there's a $14 charge on my Debit MasterCard, I'll be cancelling my subscription immediately. And resuming it again when I buy next year's Uni Card . . .<p>Edit on 29/1/10 at 21:57: Jesus, they kept delivering the paper while I was overseas, despite my account saying I was on vacation! Although it was handy getting Sunday's paper on Monday, especially after getting jealous over the fact that someone had managed to score a copy of a <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> on the plane from Singapore to Sydney. And no, my Debit MasterCard hasn't been charged yet."

It's described as a 'black comedy' . . . was hooked by the film's description and the 'comedy' part, but must have ignored the 'black'; it definitely wasn't laugh-out-loud comedy.

Lawrence's <i>Women In Love</i>), it was good. Shorter, not full of random nonsense as much as <i>Women In Love</i> (which is so bad; it's worse than the <i>Twilight</i> saga), but still a bit difficult to read (requiring use of the Internet to help me keep track of the characters). <p>I like the fact that <i>Dying</i> is blurry in the photo."

Unlike my brother, who has to do 120 hours in order to be eligible for a P1 Driver Licence, I only had to do 50 hours, which I guess is why his licence has a longer expiry date. <p>Anyway, because I am an excellent procrastinator, I'd thought I'd drag out my old licences (I'm currently on my fourth - my unrestricted licence, which means I can legally teach my brother how to drive) and see when they expired:</p><ul><li>Learner: 21 December 2007 (three years' validity)</li><li>P1: 26 October 2007 (eighteen months' validity)</li><li>P2: 27 October 2009 (thirty months' validity)</li><li>Unrestricted #1: 24 July 2012 (three years' validity)</li></ul>And just to waste even more time, here's how much each one cost at the time, compared to now:<ul><li>Learner: $16 in December 2004, $21 in October 2009</li><li>P1: $40 in April 2006, $47 in October 2009</li><li>P2: $68 in April 2007, $75 in October 2009</li><li>Unrestricted #1: $113 for three years in July 2009, still the same price as of October 2009</li></ul>OK. I've gotten that out of my system. Time to be more productive. <br />"

All acquired within the past week. Bought <em>Geogaddi</em> at the end of last month, however; only just arrived in the post today. Damn you, Australia Post! <p><strong>Geogaddi </strong>
The title of this post comes from the second track of this album, which I'm listening to at the moment in the dark to create a scary atmosphere, which works quite well when the only source of light is the graphic equaliser of the stereo dancing to <em>Music Is Math</em>. More crunchy-sounding music compared to their other albums. <s>Out of all the songs I've listened to so far, there's only one I don't like much (<em>Gyroscope</em>)</s> <i>Gyroscope</i> sounds much better when listened to through earphones. It needs another listen (preferably with earphones, in the dark), but it's quite good. <p><strong>Declaration Of Dependence</strong>
 I can't believe this cost me $26! For crying out loud, my limited-edition copy of <em>Geogaddi</em> from Discogs was less than $25 delivered to my house - FROM ENGLAND. Geez JB Hi-Fi, what happened to the hot price of $19.99 as per your website? Even the independent record store Red Eye has it cheaper at $22. <i>Plus</i> it was made in Australia, and not Europe! I must give the Penrith store kudos for actually HAVING the album in the first place, though. Very nice album to listen to when it's not raining heavily. I <em>still</em> can't figure out who does the solo in <em>Riot On An Empty Street</em> (which is my favourite song from the album), despite having heard it at least fifty times by now. After reading the album booklet (something you can't do with the iTunes download equivalent, for there is no digital booklet), I shall conclude that it is Eirik rather than Erlend. <p><strong>Love 2</strong>
I can't believe that when I went to buy this on Friday at JB Hi-Fi Liverpool, they didn't have it in stock! They didn't have <em>Declaration Of Dependence</em> either, but I was expecting that (Penrith always seems to have a better range than Liverpool), so it wasn't as shocking to me. Luckily when I went back the next day, they had it, so I was as happy as a clam again. Definitely not worthy of a <a href=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13503-love-2/ target=_blank>four out of ten rating as handed by Pitchfork</a>. I know not everyone will like it (although the majority do), but it's worthy of a passing grade! Apparently Air are coming back in April next year (quite quick for a return; it took them ten years to play live in Australia), so I hope I can go and see them again (with a paid ticket this time, Mum and Dad) and see songs like <em>So Light Is Her Footfall</em> and <em>Eat My Beat</em> played live! <p>So now I have one CD left as part of my one-CD-a-month quota . . . is R&ouml;yksopp's <em>Senior</em> coming out this year? Because if not, I might as well go and blow it on something from my Discogs shopping cart while the exchange rate is looking fantastic (56 pence compared to 39 pence this time last year) or Kelpe's new album <em>Cambio Wechsel</em> or something . . ."

Not ideal weather for listening to Kings Of Convenience's <i>Declaration Of Dependence</i>; couldn't hear it properly while the rain was pelting my car as I drove home from uni yesterday afternoon and ended up stopping the CD player a few times because the heavy rain was too loud for delicate-sounding music. <p>And while I struggled to drive home in the rain, I missed out on the hailstorm at home. How depressing!"

"event","<center><lj-embed id=""56""/></center><p>I think this might be my music video of the year . . . It's directed by Martin de Thurah (who did <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XVUyEI_0AU"" target=""_blank"">the awesome music video for R&ouml;yksopp's <i>What Else Is There?</i></a>). Two reasons why I love this music video: 
<ul><li>it has subtitles to translate the spoken Danish in the beginning; I love my subtitles!</li><li>it has men in suits and damn, do they look good in them! I have a thing for men in suits just as I have a thing for girls in pigtails. </li></ul>I can't remember how I discovered Mew (I think it was from iTunes' weekly newsletter), but I <i>do</i> know why I checked them out:
<ul><li>they're from Denmark (home of Efterklang and Trentem&oslash;ller, two other Danish musical acts I love)</li><li>the title of their new album is ridiculously long (but not as long as <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.discogs.com/Soulwax-Most-Of-The-Remixes-Weve-Made-For-Other-People-Over-The-Years-Except-For-The-One-For-Einst%C3%BC/master/59282"">this Soulwax compilation</a>) - <i>No More Stories Are Told Today I'm Sorry They Washed Away No More Stories The World Is Grey I'm Tired Let's Wash Away</i></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_More_Stories..."">the Wikipedia article for said album</a> described the album's genre as the following:	alternative rock, indie rock, dream pop, progressive rock, post-rock</li><li>said album was well received by critics</li></ul>All those points paid off. Finished listening to <em>No More Stories</em> last week; brilliant! Quite interested in checking out their other albums now, starting with their previous album, <i>And The Glass Handed Kites</i> . . .<p>Edit on 5/10/09 at 20:52: I've watched the music video <s>too</s> many times now and I swear Bo (the one with the moustache and awesome bow tie) reminds me of Professor Lupin from the <i>Harry Potter</i> films. They look similar to each other and they're both being tortured . . . Only difference is that one is a musician and the other is a werewolf."

"event","Yes, so Miss Bailey is making us do a concrete poem, a thought which scared the hell out of me, but I have been warned about her ""put you on the spot"" tendancies. It should be ok though as I have asked around and no-one else seems to know what they are doing. Except Joni who came up with a pepper pot/engine sounds poem after 1 day.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, I decided to do mine about memory, mainly because I was thinking about Miss Copeland's (is that how you spell it?)&nbsp;class while I was doing it and how I like her much more than Miss Bailey. Anyway, this is what I have come up with so far and I don't intend on spending much more time on it, so she better like it.<br /><br />Also, I made it easy to read to avoid not being able to read it out without laughing. How smart am I?

Emma and I didn't get in to the concert on Tuesday, I was very upset, but I didn't cry.

I did however go out and give myself a heavy dose of alcohol poisoning, the best remedy for any sorrows, as we all know.

I also have a big infected cut thing on my arm, I wish I had a camera to show you, but I dont. It's like a long thin version of the finger/fork thing.

Anyway, this has been a sufficient entry I feel. I will see Emma and Joni on Wednesday, then Hannah on chemistry day, 30th?????

And Lauren, I will phone you tomorrow, or later today since it is past twelve.

I do have a bit of frostbite around the bum area, but not to worry, I am sitting in a bowl of hot water.

After the park thing I went with my very good chum Emma (mentioned above) to the gym, that was very enjoyable, apart from in the changing rooms there was this woman in the shower and she came out all naked and what not, has she no shame? So I think for next time I may buy a blindfold for when I go in the changing room. One that had eyes on it so it looked like I wasn't wearing it. Or a pair of those glasses that you wear when you want to sleep in class, you know, the ones that have eyes on them. 

After that Emma and I went back to her house and she let me borrow her brand new copy of Mysterious Skin, I will be watching/perving over that once I am done here. I let her borrow my copy of The L Word though so I am not the only perve in the house, although, it is my copy....oh well. I hope Emma is watching it right now, and being aroused by the sex scenes, as I was. Only kidding....

Well, this entry seems to have become some kind of admital of perversities which I possess so I will stop here, I seem to have rambled rather alot.

I would like to thank Emma and Joni for commenting on my last post, however insulting they may have been (Joni), as I was scared that I would be one of those loner journal people who never gets posts and stuff, so thanks for that guys...how gay.

Cheerio xx"

"event","Hello again. I apologize for my nine month absence (my god) but unfortunately it could not be helped as my computer was indeed stolen by elves who work for santa. Now my mother always told me the elves bought the presents...how wrong she was. So anyway, I just got back from a nine month holiday to the north pole, and I did manage to retrieve my computer, as you can see. 

I am very happy to have it back and will now be updating regularily, so read it....or die.

I noticed that all my wonderfull pictures seem to have turned into little crossy boxy things, at which I am personally disgusted. I would have compensated by putting some pictures here but I cannot be bothered with stupid photobucket or anything like that. So this text will sufice...goodbye."

<P>1. Chocolate Spread sandwiches</P>
<P>2. Green Jelly</P>
<P>3. Rich Tea biscuits</P>
<P>4. Fruit Polos</P>
<P>5. A KitKat</P>
<P>6. Monster Munch crisps</P>
<P>I do not think I will be able to eat it all, I did go a bit over the top. I wanted to put an apple in it but my mum said the ones she had were 2 weeks old, so I refrained from that, also if you eat raw fruit you could get a tapeworm. I learned this today in geography in a video we were watching about DEADLY JUNGLE DISSEASES, it was rather scary and disgusting.</P>

<P>Thats right...a snow day, go out and build snowmen,&nbsp;make snow angels, and have snowball fights. But make sure there aren't any stones in the snowballs or the adults will get angry when you throw it at their child's eye,&nbsp;and you will have to go into a bad childrens institution. Your parents won't have any money any more because the other parents will have taken all their money to pay for their blind child, when you go home you will have to live with them in the new 1 room bed sit, and it will be all your fault, do you want that?

<P>1. She said she was going to punch me out the window.....as a joke</P>
<P>2. She said that people who had their name shortened to ""Cat"" should be shot at birth</P>
<P>3. She called be a scum bucket</P>
<P>4. She has funny hair</P>
<P>5. She said a women on stars in their eyes was hideous and fat....and then she realised she was pregnant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That is about it. Number four isn't really something she said, but it was funny, then I sprinkled rice in her hair, and she got angry, and I mocked her, and then was knifed.</P>"

"event","my dad has this phrase for when you idolize someone to that he uses to keep them human.  he says ""he puts his pants on one leg at a time, just like everyone else.""  so this morning, I put my pants on all at once.  I felt sort of slick, you know, oh, look at me, I put my pants on two legs at a time.  a few minutes later I looked down and realized my shirt was on inside out.

if I had one wish right now, you know, I don't really care.  I'm feeling good."

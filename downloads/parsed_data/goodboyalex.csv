"event","Not much to say this update. My ""vacation"" is over and it's back to work. Ryan and Steph's wedding and reception last week were fuggin awsome. I've never had such fun with my pants on. The only downside was, since I was part of the wedding party, I had to keep standing while just about everyone else got to sit. The reception was great. EVERYBODY was there and I got to see some friends I haven't seen in ages. I was coupled up w/ Melea so it was fitting that the sexiest bridesmaid and the sexiest groomsman walked down the aisle together. Yeah, I know, I'm a little vain.

On an unrelated note, I'm thinking of doing my blogging (hehehe, that sounds dirty) over on the myspace page I just set up. Anybody out there good with HTML and whatnot who wants to lend me a hand or two to make the page nice and spiffy. I'm not so great w/ that kind of stuff. Bill, your page is pretty neat looking. Any tips?"

"event","Things have been very good lately. Maybe a little too good. I'm very much content with the state of my life right now which scares me a little since I know I should be bracing myself for the inevitable crash. I become intensely paranoid when things go my way. Something evil must be brewing just under the surface. I have one more day of work tomorrow (projection) before my little 9 day vacation. This wasn't a planned sort of thing. The schedule just kind of worked out that way and I'm pretty happy with it. I have no idea how I'm going to pass the hours of those days. All I have planned in that time is a bachelor party one day and a wedding to go to another. Man, the wedding should prove to be a surreal experience to say the least. One of my buddies is marrying my ex-girlfriend. THE ex-girlfriend. The girl that every girl I've been with since gets compared to. *sigh* I can't say I'm bitter anymore. There was time time and a place long ago when I could see myself spending the rest of my life with her but those days are long gone. It was probably just all the drugs we were doing at the time anyway. Life goes on. Besides, I'll always have the warm, fuzzy memories of Sunday mornings with Steph. God, life was never as good as it was back then. Hard to believe that was almost three years ago....i feel old."

"event","I'm so cool, I've learned some basic HTML (If that's even the correct term).  I'm almost as computer literate as the average 4th grader. Yay me.
Check out this ( <lj user=taxidermied> ) live journal then go to your local comic book shop and buy every single Lenore comic book you can get your hands on. If you go to Lost World Of Wonders on 69th and Oklahoma you can say 'hi"" to Max. Or ""fuck you"", whatever floats your boat. Lenore is very funny, very dark and very macabre. Ahhh, the adventures of a cute little dead girl. Maybe I'm just sick in the head.

If you love someone, set them free. If they return to you, put several 8 inch blades in their head. If they return again, then run...just run."

"event","So it looks like MC Chris this saturday isn't going to happen. Stupid work. Noon to Eleven. Yeah, those are some good hours. How else would anyone want to spend their Saturday? In my on-line travels I found that Roman Dirge has a LJ which is pretty fucking spiffy. Full of nifty artwork and what not. Even if you have no clue who Roman Dirge is, you should still check it out.

I'm not cool so I can't make the name a link right to the journal, but if you search the name you'll find it. You're a clever ape.
Deliciously twisted.

P.S. Kiana is really hot. Just thought I'd state the obvious."

"event","I've been having trouble staying awake lately. I find myself falling asleep everytime I get comfortable. I actually fell asleep at work the other day, but it was all good because I missed a big rush. It's got to be the xanex. The Sat night gathering of Southgate employees didn't happen tonight because, yep you guessed it, I fell asleep. I had a bunch of missed calls when I finally woke up around Midnite but I didn't bother to call anyone back. I don't feel like doing much of anything lately anyways. I'm very much disgusted w/ my life right now. On a happier note, the other day at a political function of some sort my Mom was talking to an independent documentary filmmaker who was lobbying the city for money and I may be doing some work for him. One hand washes the other. Things always get worse before they get better."

"event","It's been a while since I've updated so I feel obligated by my boredom to do so. You can only play so much Tekken, you know? I've been on a saving money kick for the last two weeks and I think I'll have ample funds for when I bid Wisconsin farwell for spring break if i can only stop buying DVD's. I bought two of them hours after saying that I need to stop buying shit I don't need right now. Oh, well. It's only 40 bucks. I picked up Fight Club and the director's cut of Donnie Darko. I've never seen Darko so I was apprehensive about buying it, but now that I've seen it I already want to see it again. I mean, how often does a movie's plot involve time travel and a tangent universe when it's not a sci-fi flick. I thought so..."

"event","What ever happened to personal responsibility? In this foul year of our lord, 2005, personal responsibility has all but disappeared. When did this happen and where was I at the time? It must have been the nineties. The earliest example I can think of off hand is the whole Columbine tragedy. Those two fuckwits shoot up their school, killing a bunch of perfectly innocent kids in the prime of their lives, and on whom is the blame laid. The parents? No. The perpetrators? Hell no! Let's blame Wal-mart and Doom. Granted, you could buy semi-automatic weapons (or was it just ammo?) at Wal-mart at the time and that is pretty fucked up, but they were just a scapegoat on which to partially shift the blame. You can buy cigarettes at 7-11. How many people die every year from smoking related illness compared to shooting deaths? Let's skirt the real issue and lay false blame so we can feel better about ourselves as a people. It's the American way.

The tobacco industry takes a lot a heat because cigarettes give you cancer. Well....no shit. Tobacco companies spend millions of dollars a year on advertising aimed at preventing young, dumb kids from picking up this filthy, disgusting but oh so cool habit. Everybody know smoking causes cancer, not to mention plenty of other ailments. Come on people! We're living in the information age. This isn't the 1920's. It even says right on the pack in big, bold black letters ""this shit will kill you"", more or less. But, who is blamed when a smoker of twenty or thirty years dies of lung cancer? I'll give you three guesses and your first two don't count.

This country is also in the grips of an obesity epidemic. I don't throw that word around lightly but there is no better term to describe it. So who's to blame? Well, the answer is painfully obvious. That's right, McDonald's. (Did that come across sarcastic enough?) And here I thought a fried grease burger and half a pound of french fries (deep fried in grease) was good for you. Just remember, if you order a combo at McDonald's (super sized of course) and balance it out with a 32oz diet cola, you're only fooling yourself.

In America, money talks and bullshit walks. Nobody is really looking out for you. Not the corporations, not your government and not the pharmaceutical companies. And before you ask, no, Ronald McDonald is not looking out for you either. They are all producing commodities in which their soul purpose is to relieve you of your hard earned money.  We live in the capitalist empire of the world, so buyer beware. So if you McWeigh 300lbs when you're 13, die from lung cancer after smoking your whole life or shoot up your school after playing GTA, the blame is to be laid on nobody but yourself."

Milwaukee just has this energy in the summer that is sorely lacking the bookending months. Summer fest is always the highlight of any given year. I hate people but I love crowds. Especially crowds of drunk people at night. Summerfest will surely rock this year. I got arrested last year and got to listen to the big bang while handcuffed to a big concrete ""bench"". It still rocked. I went just about every day.  Wow, i'm just kinda rambling, huh? It's like my brain just threw up in here. It's been a long day and I slept like shit last night. Caffeine and ephedra are the only reason I'm still awake. I thought they took that shity off the market anyway. I found them stashed in a pantry door while looking for vivarin. Diet pills did the job tho.

Work was good today despite how lethargic I was most of the day. By the end of my shifts (plural) I was pretty awake so I just hung out in the hallway with the ""cool kids""...and Potter. He he he. Sorry Pot man. Dylan wanted to race me down the hallway and I ended up smoking him, Potter and Kyle. Kyle's a lot faster than I though he would be. I declare myself the fastest Southgate employee on two legs. I should race Chris. That could be interesting."

Aspen - In what could pass for an outlandish scene from the pages of one of Hunter S. Thompson's books, actor Johnny Depp and others who were close to the gonzo journalist are searching for a cannon and researching firing techniques to grant the author's wish that his cremated remains be blasted into the sky
""If it can be done, we will do it,"" said Boston entertainment lawyer George Tobia Jr., who has represented Thompson for about 15 years. ""Maybe it will be part of a public thing, or maybe one night a shot will ring out and people will know.""

"event","Did you know that there is evidence that thousands of years ago, before civilivation was supposed to have exsisted, there was a race of humans living on this Earth that were possibly as advanced as we are today. Kinda freaky, huh? Also, this previous civilization was not the only one of it's kind to preceed our own, but the fourth. The ancient Aztecs inherited their advanced calender, more advanced that the ones were using in the fifteen hundreds, from the Omecs before them. Neither of these civilivations could wrap their collective brains around the wheel but we're supposed to believe they could tackle pyramids and advanced mathematics (the formula Pi being integrated into the pyramids they supposedly built). This ancient, but advanced calender, lays out the timeline of the previous ""Four suns"" that came before us. We are apparently living under the Fifth Sun. The three previous civilizations met their end due to some cataclysmic event such as the great flood that snuffed out the forth sun (not literally of course, but the people living under it). The calender predicts the the Fifth Sun will set on December 23, 2012. This same basic idea has been documented by almost every ancient civilization from every corner of the globe.

Usually, I think public displays of affection are cute and sweet, but today they just made me nauseous. I couldn't wait for the day to end. By midnight, me and Dominick were at Shorty's and were toasted the death of Valentine's day. We were both glad it was over. I was so morose all day, I even tried gorging myself on chocolate but it didn't help at all.  A certain somebody tried to get ahold of me to see if I wasnted to be her Valentine, but I wasn't having it. Tomorrow will be much better."

"event","Ward Churchill, the University of Colorado professor who compared World Trade Center victims to Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann, will be allowed to speak, as planned, at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater on March 1. Every other college he was slated to appear at has canceled since the controversy surrounding his statements broke.

The school's chancellor said the decision to let Churchill speak was repugnant but necessary under First Amendment principles of free speech.

Free speech? Yes. But do they have to pay this asshole $4,000 to say what he has to say. I don't think so. I believe he belongs on a wooden soapbox in an alley with the rest of the vermin, but that's just me.

Our dumbass Gov. Jim Doyle was ""unavailable"" when Bill O'Reilly tried to contact him so he could come on The Factor and defend this position. I'm slightly ashamed to be living in Wisconsin at this moment. Fucking blue states!"

You are highly interested in inner, subjective, and personal issues, and your thinking is based more on feelings, intuition, personal experiences, and prejudices rather than reason or logic. Intellectual abilities and accomplishments without heart or soul mean little to you. You are empathic and would be an excellent counselor, for you are a sensitive listener and deeply interested in a person's feelings and inner life.

I have to admit, it was more fun than fixing seats and changing lightbulbs. I don't think Potter was happy he was the only one to show up for maintainence day but, oh well. The park was pretty cool cause they're usually closed on Tuesdays so nobody else was there.

The suicide note of Kurt Cobain (ooooh! Creepy)

To Boddah pronounced

Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile camplainee. This note should be pretty easy to understand. All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years. Since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. I haven't felt the exitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guilty beyond words about these things. For example when we're backstage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowd begins it doesn't affect the way in which it did for Freddy Mercury who seemed to love and relish in the love and adoration from the crowd. Which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is I can't fool you. Any one of you. It simply isn't fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to put people off by faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100 % fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch in time clock before I walk out on stage. I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it, and I do. God, believe me I do but it's not enough.

I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. I must be one of one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasm I once had as a child. On our last three tours I've had a much better appreciation for all the people I've known personally and as fans of our music, but I still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There's good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much. So much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, pisces Jesus man! Why don't you just enjoy it? I don't know. I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I used to be.

Full of love and joy kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can't stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable self-destructive, death rocker that I've become. I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along, and have empathy. Empathy! Only because I love and feel for people too much I guess. Thank you all from the pit of my burning nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody baby! I don't have the passion anymore and so remember, its better to burn out than to fade away. Peace, love, empathy. Kurt Cobain

Frances and Courtney, I'll be at your alter.

Please keep going Courtney

For Frances

For her life which will be so much happier without me. I Love you. I love you!"

"event","Back to work today. Yay.... Only Southgate can make three hours seems like a fucking eternity. I just wanted to curl up in the back and die half the day. After that, I went and saw House Of Flying Daggers by myself which isn't as depressing as it sounds. There wasn't a soul in the theater besides myself so I was able to smoke and yell at the screen whenever I felt so inclined,  which was pretty friggin' cool. So was the movie, if you don't mind reading subtitles (I don't).  I'm feeling very creative today for some reason and that's been a rare thing lately. I should go try to write something while I have a momentary period of peace and quiet."

"event","I just heard that Snoop Dog and Jim Morrison ""share the mic"" on a new version of Riders On The Storm for the video game Need For Speed 2. Personally, I find this disturbing and just a little bit sickening. Jim would spinning in his grave if he could hear this abomination of a bastard love child that has become of his beautiful song. That the remaining three members of The Doors have something to do with this travesty make it all the more distressing. Ray, John, Robbie? What has become of you?

I AM THE LIZARD KING! I CAN DO ANYTHING! 

AWAKE
Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one.
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity
First thing you see.
A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by it's quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us. Choose they croon the Ancient Ones The time has come again Choose now, they croon Beneath the moon Beside an ancient lake Enter again the sweet forest Enter the hot dream Come with us Everything is broken up and dances."

"event","Today didn't turn out like I planed, but it wasn't a bad day. I went over by Dom's this afternoon and wasted some glorious time killing people in GTA and then kicking his ass in Tekken 4 (like usual). I had just the tiniest little slip in the whole ""clean"" living kick I'm on, but what the hell? I'm only human after all and temptation is everywhere. It seems like I slip every time I hang out with Dom though. Coincidence? Probably not. I saw Attack On Precinct 13 with Ang tonight. It was good but I couldn't wait for it to be over so I could just go home and get away from her. I could feel her on the verge of her ""Why don't you love me?"" speech every time I looked at her. Maybe I'm giving her the wrong idea somehow but I can't see it. I turned my head away from her when she tried to kiss me (both times), maybe she'll finally get the hint. 

Random thoughts on Precinct 13: It was a pretty good movie and all, but not great by a long sight. Ja-rule died. That made me happy. John Legizamo was annoying more than anything and a wished for a slow and painful death for him every time he opened his mouth. One thing I don't get though, is how come in every movie when a cop announces his retirement he is doomed. I can only think of one movie where this doesn't hold true. Pretty decent flick anyway. Ethan Hawke was really good in it. B-. Nothing special."

"event","When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a King what he know throws the blows when he goes to the fight and he'll win the whole thing 'fore he enters the ring there's no body to batter when your mind is your might so when you go solo, you hold your own hand and remember that depth is the greatest of heights and if you know where you stand, then you know where to land and if you fall it won't matter, cuz you'll know that you're right.

It's going to be another glorious waste of a day. Nothing but bad television and mediocre movies, unless I get off my lazy ass and put something in the DVD player. Maybe I'll watch Night Of The Living Dead. Maybe not, no point to watching that movie during the day. Too much light. Sometimes I wish I could drape heavy black cloth over all the windows in my house. Is that crazy? Or just practical? Somebody told me once that insanity lingers in thought.   I want to see someone get decapitated. Maybe I'll watch Dead Alive. I pretty sure someone gets their head cut off in that one.

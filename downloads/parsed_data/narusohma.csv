Seriously. What in the hell is wrong with you weather?! You were just fine a week ago, now, you're just being a dick hole. Stop being a dick and make it warm again!

Well, now that -that- is done and over with, my life is okay. (For once!)

Becky, still a bitch, still wanna hit her and say: ""Bitch Please~"" Her boyfriend apparently doesn't like her all too much which makes it fucking great. I seriously only believe he is with her for the sex. She's so controlling with him, that it makes me look like small fries when I worry. 

Yes, baby. That is how bad she is.

If anyone has read Nickle and Dimed, please contact me because I have to do a paper on this bitch. A reaction paper, writing, in a reading class! How.. odd.</center>"

I'm not sure what to do about it. Maybe dehydration? Lack of sleep? Lack of other things? Excitement? I'm very restless. I don't know what to do anymore. I even don't know what's wrong with me.

Dave, I'm sorry that I didn't go to sleep like I should have. I just couldn't sleep and I was starting to panic, please don't be mad at me for it.

"event","<center>This is to..well we all should know by now who this is going to. It just has been on my mind all day and night, now its to the point where I can't even go to sleep. I don't want to go to sleep yet becuase I want to make ammends with you hun. I feel horrible for how I acted a couple nights ago then acting like I didn't care. I didn't want to come off that way at all. You know this but, how else am I suppost to react? I know you are all excited about the situation...but what do I say? I can't tell you 'No don't do that'. It's not me. You know I don't want to keep you for myself as greed. I want you to be independant and I love how you tell me everything. I really really appreciate it babe. It means alot that you do want to tell me these things. And, I try to tell you everything I do. Yes, I could do it more and I will be telling you as you have to me. 

God, I want to talk to you so badly right now. I want to just hear your voice and know that everything is going to be okay. It always seems to be becuase you have this effect on me. Even back in January. I asked if there would be snow on my birthday. You told me that there would be... and that day of my brithday I had a Snow Day from school. The only one we took all year. Then my argument with Sylvia, you said that things would work out. They did. You told me my skanky friend Becky was bad news, guess what..she tried to rat us out. You were right all of those times. I don't know how you do it.

Last night, when you had a headache and all.. I was abit upset that you wanted to sleep becuase I was going to tell you that I was sorry. I wanted to apologize so bad but I know that you wanted to rest. I know that I need to work on my whole... jealousy issue. I really do not try to let it get to me but, I know it will come out. I sometimes think that I just might be crazy. I don't want to loose you to anyone and I will protect you from that. There is clearly a reason why I don't like too many other females. They're all bitches. But, as you said, in steps we can work through my...issues of jealousy. I just want to know where to start. They'll be small steps...and gradually get bigger. 

And, just to remind you. I want those tickets for DEG. Paying arrangements comming soon!

I just look at my bed..and remember how you were there less than 12 hours ago. It makes me want to cry, to know that you are not there to fall asleep with. I love curling up in your arms, staying warm. I'm so filled with different emotions that I can't really think too straight to explain what I miss of you and what I wish I could have done more while you were here.

So who knows who the fuck has my picture now and I'm still hunting down the ones who had called me names. Chickens didn't have the courage to post their name onto it.

Yea, not my fault that they were starting to treat me like some five year-old. I think I know how to take care of myself and stay with people. Just not -them- at all. They annoy the living piss out of me and I do not feel like being fucking molested by one of the members of my previous 'group'. 

Fuck. That.

I went to my friend Jason and told him what was going on. He told his girlfriend and her group, I'm going with their group instead and they're letting Dave (Conor) stay in the room with me. This, I am excited about. Already though, I am getting quite a few 'talks' from my parents, but it's stuff that I already know. I will say this though; I'm gonna love ACEN.

"event","<center>Apparently, a certain individual has spoken of me as being 'pseudo-goth' and a 'catty whore'. 

At least I'm female. I like the color black. Should I honestly be labeled as 'goth'? I like wearing black and I look good wearing the color black. Does this make me a 'gothic' person? No. Not in the least. I do not worship Satan. I am not Satanic. I do not have the 'wiccan' religion. I honestly think you're full of yourself. 

As for being a 'catty whore'. I've changed my ways. I've kept myself in line thank you very fucking much. I like who I'm with. I'm -happy-. If you don't like it. Tough shit. If you think I've turned into this 'bitch', oh well. 

Tas, maybe you should have fired me, not Gen. But, why didn't you fire Gen the first time he threw a damn fit? Was it becuase you 'adored' him in anyway? Becuase you dated the man? If it is. That's favoritism. Same thing that was in Aeon for quite some time. But, it's blown over and now..I am happy with their staff. I have fixed things with a certain individual. </center>"

When I think about it..I don't like half of my friends as much as I think I do. I hate the weather and how bad it does get around here. I suppose that comes from living in Illinois. I have an attention problem at times, and it makes me go quiet when someone speaks like I'm not listening to them. But, I really am. I've learned how to tune one of my friends out becuase..she talks alot of crap. Doing it for years and just..try to ignore it.

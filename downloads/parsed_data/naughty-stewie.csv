<P>okay here it is!</P>
<P>An actor walks onsatge and goes downstage right. Another actor onstage shifts his/her body to balance out the composition in the scene. This is an example of:</P>
<P>A. An entrance</P>
<P>B. A counter cross</P>
<P>C. An exit</P>
<P>D. Opening up</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Stupid Dumb Question!""> here is the answer.</P>
<P>If you said....</P>
<P>A: Leave drama immediately!</P>
<P>C: Uhhh I could buy that.</P>
<P>D: Whoot whoot Lee V's wrong!!</P>
<P>B: GO....TO.....HELL!!! lol jk but how did you get that?? it's frickin' rediculous!!</P>

anyways....i miss the play! this may sound stupid but i don't get to see a lot of my friends anymore and that makes me sad :( (uhh-oh two frowny faces, lol) but yeah i will only see steph and nadine every once and a while and i may never see nicole and corinne. oh well....it's only a little while until Mattress audition so that'll be fun, lol. 

:GASP: x-mas is comming! (i only say x-mas because i don't want to offend anybody) i love x-mas it is so fun! i get to see my bro and my sis and i'm even getting a new dog! it's gonna be great. well...that is if i don't have to shovel any snow that much. 

speaking of snow i want it to snow really bad so that we can have...strike that, if it snows then i have to shovel, lol. so who do you guys think will be lady larken in the show? do you guys even know what the shows about? lol i guess not but then again i am talking to a computer screen, lol. oh well. 

hey, i want to do something this weekend like go see ocean's 12 or something so anybody that doesn't have anything to do, let's get a group together and do something. 

okay, i've quenched my thirst for self-satisfaction so i think i'll go. man, i wish lorraine would hurry up! ""see you on the morrow"", bye!

humming to the beat of my own drum,

P.S. I don't know what complacent means, can somebody help me? lol"

"event","Hey everybosy! I haven't posted in a while so i just though i'd talk about my trip to New York on saturday. Yeah so i got up at 3:30 but didn't ""officially"" get out of bed until like 4:00, lol. Then, we (me and my mom :ugh:, lol) didn't like leave the house until around 20 till 5 which is pretty bad because the bus was supposed to leave at 5 which, coincidentally, george arrived after, lol. Anyways (wow i just realized that i've said ""lol"" 3 times already. i laugh a lot) umm yeah so we get on the bus and corinne unpacks all of this crap and lorraine and i are like ""yeah she's gonna break out her hot-plate and make soup later"" lol.

 so we leave and i fall asleep, well when i wake up i see that i'm sleeping with nothing covering me up and my head resting on my coat against the window while corinne's got this big ass blanket and this big ass pillow sleeping like a baby. well that didn't last long because soon after i wake up the people behind us woke up and they started talking. well thay would......not.....stop! it was soo annoying i was like shut-up but of course i didn't say that because they're like 2 years older than me. 

 Ok anyways we get there and lorraine wants to go on the subway. well i don't really like the subway for various reasons and saturday didn't really help much because there was this guy on the subway that started singing and then he would randomly duckdown and like ""search"". know what i mean? well yeah and it was really annoying. plus we got lost and had to get help from a random hoboe but we won't talk about that. 

 so then we went to time square and saw various amazing things! first we went to virgin records and i got De-Lovely and Once Upon A Mattress which was fun. after that we saw the ""naked cowboy"" which was fun. then we went to starbuck's and i got my vanilla creme (which is great by the way) and lorraine and her father encountered ""god"", lol. 

 then on our way to toys 'r' us we saw this hobo flick off this guy with a camera phone which was great! and when we got to toys 'r' us there was a ferris wheel inside which was great and lorraine and i were like ""we so have to get corinne lauren and kaitlyn and ride this"" :) but we never did :( lol. 

 so then we went and ate lunch at applebees (which, by the way, is so unoriginal lol) and saw the transexual lol. ok there was this woman who was eating at a table next to us and she went into the bathroom, well lorraine went in right after her and she had left the toilet seat up! i'll let you draw your own conclusions lol. 

 ok anyways then we went on our amazing quest for my hat which i found in the end and am so happy about. ate dinner at the Macy's restaurant, got a virgin pina colada :) and accidentally spilled mr. dougherty's $13 beer a little bit lol which lorraine is going to tell lee o about so that he thinks i'm even more clumsy :ugh: yeah and then we got on the bus and rode home. 

 but apparently, and i didn't know this, but corrine got up and moved back to where kevin, OH YEAH! i forgot to tell you about brian and his fake rolex. apparently brian got a fake rolex off of the corner of a street that he is terribly proud of and was showing everybody so yeah. and for some reason kevin and i had this really awkward handshake. he was like so did you have fun and he put his hand out which, i think, was for me to slap but for some reason i said oh yeah i had loads of fun and shook his hand which might not seem that weird to some people but it was to me........:long thinking pause:.........anyways back to what i was saying before, yeah corinne got up and moved back put apparently she wanted to move back up with me at some point on the trip but i was ""asleep"". now i feel bad because i wouldn't have minded if she woke me up just to move back. now i say ""asleep"" because i really couldn't get comfortable until i put both of my coats up against the window when we were like 2 minutes from home but yeah. :deep breath: so that was my trip to New York. beat that bitches lol!

"event","Hi everyone who's reading. Sorry i haven't written in so long but i was kinda recovering from a fight i had with my friends at my party but.....uh...we won't talk about that! 

Anyways HC was a lot more fun than i thought it would be (you were right corinne and francie, lol) I got to dance with a whole lot of people. As francis would say it was ""mucho fun"" lol. I was upset that i didn't get to see bob, donna, or mike's brother :( but that's ok :). OMG we went to eat at Denny's afterwards and it was awesome! I was kinda tired though, so i didn't really talk much so lorraine thought i was sad but i wasn't. I was kinda shaken up by alex's driving but we won't talk about that either, lol.

We have rehearsal after school today and i really don't want to go because i think Lee O. is gonna make me do sound fx again and i really don't want to, lol. I mean think about it when the highlight of your day is make doorbell and telephone noises after school, you kinda star t to realize that you have no life! Oh well.

I wonder if lorraine and mike are still going to AUSA? (more party stuff) Hmm i think we meed to talk about what we were talking about some more cause i'm sure all of us got a lot off of our chests. :big meaningful pause: I suppose that's what lorraine was talking about everytime she said that michael was mean. But that couldn't happen all of the time could it? :gasp: i'd better stop talking about this before i say something and they get mad at me so i guess i'll be going, wite to ya soon!

SHE IS A LIAR! i am  not bailing out on my HC date! i just wanted to know why girls were so obsessed with dances so i used an example. I AM NOT A BAD PERSON! i'm really not. well....sometimes.....most of the time i'm not. 

ok changing the subject, my mom just got a book on golden retrievers so i'm pretty sure she's about to cave. i want a dog sooo bad! OMG lorraine and mike you guys have to spend a lot of time with her so that she's used to you when she moves in with us. if she doesn't know your scent (took me about five tries but i got it) she won't be comfortable around you. (i learned this in golden retreivers for dummies, lol)

OMG have you ever notice how they have like ""for dummies"" books for like everything? i mean think about it. but they can't have one for everything. i mean i'm sure they have ones for like the obvious ones like raising a child, changing a diaper, spanish. but do you think they have one for like.....i don't know.....building a paper masche (did i spell that right?) computer do you? i don't know. well lunch is almost over so i think i'm gonna get off but i'll be bak on later, bye

So, yeah but after the baby is born...oh yeah! I'm gonna be an uncle in nine months, YAY ME! but yeah as i was saying, after the baby is born i get to call her grandma though so that'll be fun, making her feel old :evil laugh: wow i'm really hyper. i just noticed that. you know that can be bad in some cases! i mean think about it. if you were a secret agent and you had to go on this secret mission to follow this guy that the CIA or whatever think is a murderer and you follow him to his apart and you sneak into this construction site accross the street to spy on him and you go up to the thirteenth (13 because it's unlucky) floor and you are so hyper that you get bored and start dancing around and you fell off that would be dangerous so there! wow that was a long story. well i'd better go to class since the bells about to ring so oops ther it goes ttul bye!

I wonder if my friends are comming over to my house after the HC game? Melissa said she wanted to but then today she was acting all confused so.....i don't know. Lorraine kinda pissed me off last night I'm not sure why though. I think i was just on a thin thread. Maybe I should appologise again? But then again we did make up with our classic Ellen DeGeneres joke.(""i've just been sprayed in the eye with a produce hose!"" LOL) We have rehearsal after school today and i need to tell lorraine that her ortho appointment is cancelled. Maybe i shouldn't tell her just to see what happens, lol. No, then Lee O will get mad at me. Like he isn't already. I think i'm starting to piss him off because the other day i accidently (did i spell that right?) hit him in the mouth with a bird cage, lol! and then today he got mad at me again for asking to go to the batroom during class so yeah.........5 min left! Then i have to go present this stupid project for bio! Yeah, i really don't want to do that. I've spent like only two days on it and we had three weeks :P but that's ok. Kalli thinks i'm obsessed with these parties i've been having every week but i'm really not. i just think they're fun and i like having fun is that sooo bad? Oh well that just means she's not invited lol j/p. :GASP: i'm going to look at golden retriever puppies this week! i'm so excited! i've decided i'm going to name her madeline but maddie for short. Lorraine, me, and you-know-who lorraine (lol) are going to get an appartment and take her with us when we go away to college. It'll be soo fun! you-know-who says we'll be like FRIENDS (and he wonders why we call him our ""gay"" friend lol) so yeah. anyways there's only like one minute left of lunch so i think i'm gonna go. talk to you later, peace!"

I think that he's probably my best guy friend. Now, this is pretty sad because i've only known him for like a month but i think that we're pretty close for only knowing each other for a month. Now before you guys get any nasty ideas, the reason i call him my ""gay"" friend is because all my friends and i make fun of him because he acts kind of gay but we all know he's straight (at least for two more years, lol).

"event","She told me, on the phone today, that she is so proud of me. That perhaps she over-reacted the other day but she's just so proud of me. She said that my practicum was probably the hardest of anyone's, that it was the most valuable. She said that I have great drive and tenacity.

Who is this woman?

So on Friday she observed me and it went well. I could feel it going well. One of my sister's woke up at the time I was starting and prayed to our great great grandmother who was herself a teacher, and radical for her time. Everything she prayed for is what I got... and I never have that during observation: comfort, humour, fun, energy.

Anyways, my FA came up to me after and cupped my face in her hands while spouting that she was so proud of me. She started talking about how it takes everyone a different amount of time to 'arrive'. I responded in saying that I have been 'there' before, but I just happened to feel more comfortable finally during this observation. She cut me off and said 'No excuses, just say thank you'. Ok.

She said she could finally see me as a teacher.

What I see now is this: the other class was so difficult, of course I never felt comfortable with observation. With this new sweethearted class, I didn't feel comfortable during the first observation because of my bad experience with observation during the last class. The second observation wasn't very comfortable either because she stayed a long time, longer than usual, and I hadn't heard feedback from my last one. The third one, I had written feedback from my second yet no verbal, but I had just stopped caring so that helped. However, I figure if I had had a sweet-ish class from the get-go, I would have been fine. Richer experience, fine, now that it's near over. I have one more observation tomorrow, then Friday is the end. I still have to be observed twice by my school associate and once by the vice-principal (we have no principal). On Thursday after school, I have to have my final evaluation done (which is totally unfair and ridiculous!). I'm lucky cuz my sister is going to help me. Never would have passed without that one.

PS. I have mostly been writing on <lj user=""v3g4n""> cuz I'm tired. Maybe one day I'll transfer it over here in a moment of excess and orderliness."

"event","That was my last day in that class. Hurray for me. I listened to her teach them, and just silently cheered that they were all hers now.

<lj-cut>So I get to see my new class tomorrow. 3 days of observation/integration, then spring break to plan. Then teaching for 3.5 weeks. Longer than I had previously thought.

My faculty associate was not happy with me once again. She came to see me, and stood in the class while the children said goodbye to me for the last time. That's brutal. She shouldn't be in there, observing me for my last moments with them. Did I ever mention how she totally invaded my personal life, asking me about anti-depressants and counselling (and suggesting both)? She seems to think that she understands who people are - does she not realize that there is a power dynmamic and a particular situation, so this is not who I am? She thinks that her and the other student teacher at my school are the same 'kind of people', with which that student teacher disagrees. The FA told that student teacher that people like them might never find love. WTF? So talking to the student, the FA asks if her current relationship is a 'sane love'. She is trying to bond with students, and she's crossing lines she should not. Looking into her eyes today, I was picturing her as an evil force that I had to be strong against - how weird is that?

Oh, so why she wasn't happy with me: She started going off about how I am more defined now. I started stuttering and stumbling with a response and I knew that I wasn't able to produce what she wanted. That's my problem, I have major trouble faking. So she mentioned that I seemed unsure. I explained that I'm not quite sure what she means by defined. She went off about how I'm coming into my own. Vague party. Look, I was given a really hard class, that's it lady. Sure, I'll seem more comfortable in the new class - because they aren't hellions. She just won't say it - social politics.

Speaking of social politics, I had my first ever parent teacher interview. I let my sponsor teacher do most of the talking. It's interesting. The teachers are out to protect themselves from brutal parents. You get burned once and you stop sharing information? I hope that I can be more open with my parents, or have more substantial information for them.

I gave my sponsor teacher some Starbucks coffee for a parting gift. Gross. At least it was fair trade. My consumer politics have gone down the tube during this practicum. Not completely, but dramatically.

Funniest thing of the week: The teacher and I were watching one of the kids presenting on Chimpanzees, and this other kid sitting in his seat had tied his sweater around his waist... but had also accidentally tied it around his chair. We watched him try and get up as he was attached. Hilarious. Then he didn't untie it, he just tried to figure out a way to get unattached without untying it. FUNNY.

I heard today that at least two people dropped out of our program. Brutal, but this makes me feel better.

I'm excited about my new teacher and my new school. She sounds so nice and on top of things. The school sounds amazing. I am so hopeful.

I really hope to run in the morning before school. Exercise makes such a difference for me. It's just so hard to get up in the morning. Tonight I am going to bed at 8pm? Then maybe I can get up at 5:20am?"

"event","I am so sick. I really shouldn't be going to school. The days are brutal now. They were already brutal. Now the kids get away with more, and I deliver much less understandable lessons.

My sponsor teacher talked to me about their messy desks, and told me it wasn't a personal attack. What? Their desks have always been messy with her. I can see that they are possibly messier. I would love to make them have clean desks.

One boy's parents are concerned about using punishment with him, that he doesn't respond well to it. When you have a boy that never listens, that runs around and wrestles with others... that tells me to hurry up in explaining something (and I'm only explaining it to him because he wasn't listening in the first place)... and who does a million other inappropriate things... what the hell are we supposed to do? We've tried everything. It's fucking ridiculous.

I'm so excited to see what the other teacher does. If you don't already know, I've gotten a new placement (I've been posting more in my personal journal). I start on Wednesday, plan during spring break, then teach for 3 weeks. Hopefully I'll be in a better physical/mental state by the end of spring break. I need to have some fun before I start it all over again.

I really wish that I could stop teaching this class now. I'm so sick of them. There are some lovely kids (they are all lovely though, just not in this context), but the other ones I'll be happy to never see again. They kill me. I'm really hoping that the next class and the next teacher will reintill my hope and energy. So thankful that I get to leave.

Right now I'm so tired. I'd like to watch a movie and then go to sleep. I have to lesson plan. Hating it."

[1] 3 girls in my class enlisting me to help them plan a secret birthday party for the sponsor teacher, and particularly 1 girl who was so respectful towards me during the planning

[1b] That 1 girl told me that her sister thinks I'm cool

[2] When the music lesson sucked and I scrapped it, and ended up dancing a bit silly and then had them do a congo line behind me to the cloakroom - and for once I had everyone doing the same thing

PS: After talking to my mother, I am going to see if I can pursue the option of choosing to have a weak reference letter from my faculty associate instead of extending my practicum. They are desparate for French teachers. I only want to sub in the beginning anyways. ANYTHING not to extend this practicum. Seriously."

Just thought I'd post this link to a video here, passed on to me from my old sponsor teacher:

It talks about educating the creativity out of children, and about the failings of curriculum hierarchy (math trumps art)."

"event","I'm kind of drunk. I came home to a cake that my roommates made for me. The beauty of my life. Glorious, really. Then we had wonderful dinner around a candle lit table... and drank wine.

Today was different. I chose less battles, picked less of them. I tried to be caring and supportive instead of their disciplinarian. I had more energy because of coffee. I tried to engage them instead of forcing them into compliance. It's weird to think of myself as a disciplinarian... as coming into a class and trying to whip them into shape. I found them so incredibly disrespectful, and I wanted to force it out of them. I treated tham as though they weren't capable of anything more. I'm rather embarassed, and shocked that I would behave so?

I have much to learn in terms of how to non-coercively engage them. I just have much to learn. It's interesting to hear advice coming from all sides, and try to find out what is honest for me. I think my FA went to far in kind of insinuating that anti-depressants might be an idea for me (but maybe I read too much into that?), but everyone has their things, and it's me that needs to stand up and figure out what's right for me.

I am learning, and that's all that matters. Being broken down to the point of fearing failure is allowing me to take greater risks. It's pretty awesome despite the outcome. I look forward to tomorrow. To delivering clearer lessons, to finding ways to engage them, to opening communication and community. Today (and every morning from now on), we had a circle share. We can share whatever we want... like what we liked about the previous day... what was challenging... etc. It's nice to sit together and just listen. We don't normally have that. These are things that I want in the future, but was not enacting in the present. I was trying to jump through the hoop, and putting of the good for tomorrow. Now I have to enact it.

I send myself strength and confidence. I will continue to try and connect and appreciate all of the students.

I started positive reinforcement today. You get a marble to add to the jar when you are doing something awesome. I give them out as often as possible. Maybe tomorrow we can introduce the idea of nominating other people for a marble... recognizing the awesomeness of our friends.

Right now, sometimes I feel so broken down - and I feel like I'm wearing the smile that one of the kids in my class does. This pained, fearful, panicked, trying to survive kind of smile. I feel so sorry for that boy. My FA is always telling me that it's not about me, that they are the focus. It's like how you learn that it's not about you at a party... you think about other people more... and things get easier."

"event","I can't stop crying. I am so scared. My faculty associate is telling me not to be, that this is where I should be (according to the universe), and all that. She's hitting the nail on the head in regards to the problems I am having, but it's so brutal.

I really do just want to make it through this practicum, but perhaps I'll have to give that up. I mean it's great to let go, isn't it? If I'm not supposed to finish, I'm not supposed to finish. I'll have to grow more before I can do it, or never come back. I don't know.

I have a lot of fear, and stress and negative outlook when it comes to the world. Not all the time, but it's a large part of me. This comes out in my class. There are many great activities I see doing with my future class, but I haven't been doing with them. I'm scared. I just wanted to make it through. Now I'm not.

I can't fully explain all the problems in my class at the moment, but it's not good. I tried punishing them into compliance which is a bad move. Now I'm fairly lost. I have amazing support in that school, but I still don't know that I'll make it through.

She doesn't see me finding human connections with the students, and it's true. I don't feel safe, and so they don't either.

She talked to me about whether this is the right time for me to be doing this practicum. I understand, and I question it as well BUT that is so brutal. My parents have paid for this education, and then I couldn't get through it? My dad has given me the car.

Whatever though, right? I'll do my best. I'll try really hard with the idea that it's out of my control. I think it's partially unfair... but it's the cards I've been dealt. It sounds like I have to cancel my flight to France because I'll likely need to extend my practicum into April with another placement at another school.

I wish I had more confidence. Even during the science fair this afternoon, I felt really awkward amongst the students of the school. Partially to do with my ability to speak French, but also it's just me."

"event","Today is the worst of the days.

I have to lesson plan for tomorrow, because my faculty associate is coming to observe me, and I can hardly stop crying.

My FA called me while I was crying. So I probably told her more than I should have. Part of my problem (?) with all of this, is that I can't just tell people what they want to hear. I just tell them what is actually happening.

So today my sponsor teacher told me that two of the boys feel that I don't like them. She told me that I need to find ways to compliment them - even if it's just about their shirt. She said that when they are sent to the other classroom, they feel that they are being demoted (it's a grade two class, and I have grade threes). So my sponsor teacher doesn't want me to send them there anymore,  except rarely. She also doesn't want me to send anyone out of the room before recess. I mean, I understand all of this. It's not fun for them, and it's not fun for me. It's authoritarian punishment. She told me that it's not working. I said that I thought it was, and she repeated that it wasn't.

But then I swing all ways. When I talk to the grade two teacher, I feel like all this punishment is fine. When I talk to my sister, I think my sponsor teacher just doesn't swing my way - and that she just doesn't like having firm systems. When I talk to my FA, I feel like it does make sense... and that I do need to find a different way. She suggests that I talk to the boys one on one, ask them how they feel about my systems so far, about being sent to the office/etc, and what they think would be fair?

She wants me to see each of them as a positive member of the classroom, to find the positive in them. I do too, but there's a block. I don't know how. I just don't know how when it comes to a lot of things in that class. And it plays on my lack of confidence. I'm gaining confidence, that's for sure, but I'm always incredibly aware of the lack. Today especially.

And a major factor of stress is the fear of not making it through this hoop. Fear that they'll decide that I'm not good enough. They all want different things from me, and I don't feel like I can give those things to them.

I'm learning. I don't know if I'd survive this if it were not for my sister, my amazing roommates and house, my father's car, etc. Yesterday up at campus, I wondered how a lot of these people are dealing with it. It's hard, and it seems that some of them have worse lots than I.

A kid left me a note today: ""To Mme. Nicole, I'm not having much fun in math and other subgecs. Can you mack it funner. Pleas""

Need to see this positively. Need positive focus. Work a bit, go to bed. Tomorrow's crazy hair day. Third week, 3.5 to go.

Also, the gay teacher took me out for coffee after (cuz I drove her home). It was awesome, even though I was nervous... cuz that's my style. The staff at this school are SO supportive."

I don't have everything planned for tomorrow... but I suppose I figure I can wing it? The more I can do so, the better for my mental health.

Today we were up at campus. I got to hear lots of horror stories. Makes me thankful for having a school with such great supportive staff. I'm also thankful for my incredibly supportive faculty associate and my laid back sponsor teacher. There are definite complaints, but for the most part, I've got a great deal.

I feel positive about it all, in a grand sense. Obviously it can get me down - it can be extremely overwhelming.

We talked about hiring today, which was interesting. Interviews and the like. My impression is that I'll be a substitute to begin with, which is good (except for the commuting). I get to find out where I really want to be, and learn about different teachers' strategies. Plus I can take any day off that I like.

Stay in the moment."

"event","School today was decent. This is partly due to having Wednesday afternoon skating, Thursday off, and Friday afternoon off (and minus one of the most difficult kids).

I kind of love it when my sponsor teacher is not there. I feel completely comfortable to do what feels right. As soon as she walks into the room, I feel a bit nervous, and like I can't completely be myself.

I loved when one of the most resistant kids handed in his morning agenda work without me asking, for the first time. That was amazing.

I love seeing them habituate to my systems. I love the simple tool of counting seconds til they listen to me, and then keeping them in those seconds during recess. It's unfair, but so effective - and I can only be so fair. They have to group-regulate.

I love when kids that usually seem to detest me, engage in a hearty reciprocal smile with me. It's lovely. Today, while my sponsor teacher was teaching art, I watched them and really smiled with love for them - possibly for the first time? Even one boy who is very difficult, watching him pace around the room while she read a story - I just felt really appreciative of his situation in that he obviously has a hard time staying in one place."

"event","Today I cried. I still feel like crying. I was so angry with the world on the way home.

I cried in between recess and lunch, and felt close to crying while teaching them. I had wonderful support from the learning assistance teacher, and then some from my sponsor teacher (but I usually end up feeling like she secretly disagrees with something that I'm doing - but just isn't saying it - she doesn't give me much advice - or so it feels).

After lunch, I took six of the most difficult and talked to them in a separate room. It didn't go so well. I mean what could I really say? They expressed how difficult it is for them to stay in their place. I said that I understood, and that it's unfortunate that we can't have lessons that meet their needs, but that I am one person and that I already stay up way too late preparing for their class. I mostly just lectured them. Sweet, the person I've always wanted to be.

Then I taught out the rest of the day trying to ignore them.

I either have to be stricter or more flexible. I either have to send them to the office or another teacher's classroom as soon as they lose their 3 chances (re: before recess) or I have to just let them do pretty much whatever they want - and just send them to the hallway, office or other class as I see fit (re: not that often?). I can still follow up on them finishing their school work. I found out that one boy who doesn't catch up during catch up time, because he doesn't want to, is allowed to be kept after school. Sweet.

I sat in on a meeting with a parent. My sponsor teacher explained the behaviour of the child, but she had no notes and didn't really address everything. It was a weird experience. It was nice to hear more about the kid through his mother. I was warned that she would be really intense, but I found her to be quite lovely. She told me that her kid doesn't like me. I told her that I know. Of course he doesn't. I have tried to make him do his work since I met him. He was disrespectful to me right away.

Anyways... adventures in institutional school. Today I am thinking that I would like to work one day per week for benefits and the go start some awesome co-ops or something instead. It's hard to know that not all classes are like this.

It's just so hard to know how to meet their needs (and thus mine).

I also feel like I'm trying to whip some kids into shape, kids who have been getting away with tons for five months. I'm not sure I want to do it.

I realize that we are lucky to have an education, but sometimes the institution seems so gross (well always in some way, but sometimes it just feels completely disgusting). And when you feel down on the world, it's easy to find problems (especially when you drive home through the rich areas)."

"event","Today I was excited about going. Really excited. Excited about my confidence, about being a teacher. I feel perfectly capable of handling them, and generally feel like I have them more under control than she did. However, that's easy to say when I am distracted by way more things than I was when I was observing. I am much happier being their teacher than just being that person that would chase after them all the time to do their work. I'm learning a lot about how to deliver lessons to 8 year olds - easy does it. I'm having the opportunity to use new systems - of my own choosing.

I talked to my faculty advisor today - best conversation yet. Totally from my end because I am feeling more confident, and because I have more to talk with her about. It was an important conversation for me, as I was feeling the need to hear again how she is supporting me and trusting me. I get worried about how well I'm doing, but I need to give myself more credit. I am constantly trying to find ways to better the situation in that class. Part of my problem is that I am thinking more about me than them. I know we're all linked, but I'm having trouble feeling a lot of compassion or concern for some of them. Granted, I haven't known them very long, so I can't expect to be too attached. However, I was thinking about my interactions with them, and how I do have some affect in terms of how they interact with life. On the other hand, I feel like there is no hope, and that I just have to survive them. The kid that poses the most problem has parents who hate the principal of the school (or so I hear - not to judge them without even meeting). Your family can dictate a lot for how you perceive and interact with the world. I get to meet with those parents next week. I've heard that they made two teachers' lives hell. The principal can't come to the meeting because they don't like him (sweetest principal I've ever met). It'll be interesting. I'm pretty excited.

Today one of the difficult boys said ""Don't you have something better you could be doing?"" when I tried to get him to do his work. I responded with ""That's not appropriate. This is my job. My job is to get you to do your work. If I need to move you so that you work, I can do that.""

Another kid was making it so hard to get him to do his work. He'd been pulled out of computer class to finish it. He was just refusing, and joking around. At some point he told me he didn't want to do it, and I said ""I don't care."" I was smiling though, and I know him well enough to know that he would find it funny. They're amazing kids, and they know that a lot of school is ridiculous. They're just having really bad attitudes about it. I've done and will continue to do the same in my own life.

Ok, then there was an incident today. <lj-cut>Kid X, Y and Z. All difficult kids. Though Z, less so. X and Y, the most difficult. X and Y are working. X says ""North Korea is going to blow up my head."" Y laughs. Z is Korean from South Korea. He gets upset and throws a tennis ball at X. Then Y grabs Z's soccer ball and runs off to the cloakroom with it. Z runs after Y, and pushes him in the cloakroom to get his ball back. Y falls and hurts himself. I come into the cloakroom, unaware of what has transpired. I see Y on the floor, and as a boy who causes a LOT of problems, I frustratedly tell him to get up. I get him to sit in a chair and see that he's in pain. I get everyone to leave the cloakroom so it's just him and I. He tells me a bit of what happened. This provides me with a much needed rare chance to be of comfort to him (we have nearly no positive rapport). I call Z over and tell them they both need to calm down, and that they are going to each tell me what happened, one at a time. I get both sides and find out all the information above. The conversation ends with Z so pissed off that he walks away dismissing Y. I did get to explain that it's not about who threw the hardest punch, it's that everyone has thrown punches now. The comment wasn't okay. It's not okay to take revenge by throwing something at someone. It's not okay to laugh at the comment, and not stand up against it. It's not okay to run away with someone's ball. Anyways, I left them both to be pissed at their desks. Then I talked to Y, and asked if he'd want to meet again after school. He declined. I told him that it sucks to be in this situation, that hopefully it'll be forgotten by tomorrow (sketchy of me), and that I get into situations that are uncomfortable like this with my friends and it feels rotten. I talked later to X and told him what I'd heard (that he said the comment). I said that I felt there was a problem, and asked him if he knew what it was. He said it was because Z comes from Korea. Then he protested that Z comes from South and not North Korea. I explained that those comments aren't appropriate even if a person from that country is not present. I talked about how Z feels hurt, and suggested X could apologize. I explained that Z might not say ""thank you"", and that Z might still act angry. I'm sure I made plenty of mistakes here. One is that I shouldn't have told X what I thought he should do, I should have told him that he needs to think of an appropriate restorative measure or else I would think of one for him. Yet even then, there were mistakes from all parties. Should I have a meeting with all of them? Let them talk one at a time? Have them use 'I' statements? It's pretty overwhelming. I have to talk to Z tomorrow and let him know that I talked to X.</lj-cut>

I might try to have class meetings. Keep an agenda list on the board. Teach concensus (with a fall back on voting?). Have a minutes taker, a speakers list taker and a facilitator on rotation?

In the morning today, one girl's mother came in to talk to me. ""I don't know how to start this..."" I wasn't nervous, I just wanted to hear what she had to say. Apparently her daughter cried last night because I put her name on the board. I have started to write subject names on the board, with the names of those who haven't finished the work below. This is because it's too hard for me to talk to them one at a time. 21 versus 1. She only had one thing to hand in, no big deal. Basically, I need to talk to her and ask her what she thought it was about - and explain what I meant. Then I need to address the class to let them know what I mean by it.

I'm dreaming of having a data projector (to project my computer screen on the wall). I want the Internet in my classroom."

"event","My first full day of teaching. One down, twenty-nine to go. The first half of the day was great. The second half felt more like I bombed. Two of the difficult kids weren't there.

My sponsor teacher told me that she wished that one of the difficult kid's parents would drug him. Woah. I mean, I can understand her intentions. She recognizes that this is making the kid fit the system... but she also has to deal with the stress. However, it seems to me there are more things she could be doing. Yet they all deal with discipline. I'm no good with maintaining positive relationships with some of the kids. I mean, I can feel sorry for them... institutions can really blow. It's just that when they repeatedly defy me, and never listen to me (they pretend not to hear my voice), I start not to care too much what's good for them (unless it makes my life eaiser - which is generally how things work). I definitely need a change of attitude. I'm assuming it'll come somehow - perhaps not with this class. She said this is the best class she's ever had. This is the worst class I've ever been in. I don't get it.

I am so swamped (and on LJ?). It's time for bed already but I have so much work to do. Part of the reason that today didn't go so well is because I didn't have lesson plans for the afternoon - so the lessons kind of flopped. I don't have time to always be making lesson plans though.

My plans (that I was unsure of) to go to France for April may have flopped. I can no longer get that cheap ticket price.

"event","01. I got to sit at the teacher's desk today, and it was just rad doing my work there. It's nice not to work at the back of the class on a makeshift desk.
<lj-cut>02. I've been keeping myself disengaged from the class as much as possible as it's hard to be consistent with classroom management when she is doing most of the teaching.
03. When I taught my math lesson today (3rd lesson so far), it went well despite my boring delivery. The point is that they stayed in their desk nearly 100% of the time, they were quiet, and they ALL finished their work (they pretty much NEVER all finish their work with their regular teacher). They finish their work with me because I give them free time as soon as they are done, and because I use this red card system to make it really easy to see who is done or not. --And yes, I feel a certain tinge of disgust as I write this. Institutionalizing the children. But I know that I'm conscious and thoughtful of the situation (yet could always be more so), and that I'm dealing with a particular class at the moment, the worst I've ever been in for behaviour related issues... excuses, excuses).
04. I have wireless Internet in my classroom. Thus,
05. ...I stayed late today and did my work there. That's so nice, not to have to take it home with me.
06. My house is really supportive and my family is amazing.

I taught my first lesson today. WOAH. There is so much to be on top of during a lesson with this particular class. Just getting them to do their work or stay in their desks is a constant battle.

I constantly feel like a jerk, or an institutional authoritarian whatever BUT HONESTLY, these kids are not benifiting from having no boundaries. They constantly lie to me, and pretend to cry if I take something away from them. When I take a toy away, they go find another one. It's pretty ridiculous. One kid whines that it's not fair, another stomps away after I've talked to him. Ugh.

Anyways, tomorrow I have to try to be better about three things:

01. Keeping track of how teams are doing (I split the class up into teams), and giving them points as they are off task, etc.
02. Stamp their work and give them a red tag when they are done (so they can have free time).
03. Use the 3 chances system when they are off task etc. It'll be nerve wracking for me to make one of them work at the back of the class in front of both my school associate and my faculty associate, but what can I do?

One more hurdle jumped tomorrow after my FA has observed me. I think I only have 5 observations from her after that. Sweet.

So I'm extremely lucky, as I seem to always say, that my sister is helping me so much. She's essentially doing some of the work for me. She's writing my journal reflections and working on this other project for me. Beyond that she is starting to write my science unit! She's pregnant and so has the time. Plus she's just super supportive, has been through the program, etc. She apparently didn't have to do near as much during her practicum and it was in English - bonus!

So I have to teach my first lesson tomorrow morning. Should be interesting with this class. I have to learn to not get so upset when they don't listen to me.

I have so much work to do, just to produce crappy lessons. Too bad they make us produce them in a specific format - I end up spending so much time just typing out drivel.

Anyways, I worked the entire day at my sister's house - fun!

Well off to bed with myself - off to another week of pure joy! It's amazing to think that I only have 7 weeks until I'm over the hump and onwards to an actual career. Blows my mind."

"event","This morning I went skating. On the way there, in the car with my sponsor teacher, I learned that she too likes Architecture in Helsinki. I raced a kid on the ice, at his request, and he fell and hurt himself. Not at all badly, but one of the mother's took a look at his arm. Sometimes kids milk it. I've learned to laugh at first, and see if they laugh with me. If not, then there's a problem. When the parent left, he looked at me and said, ""I won.""

Then, at lunch, a bunch of 8 year old girls taught me how to knit. All lovely, except for the one that took my knitting away from me under the guise of helping me. She was just knitting my yarn by herself for over five minutes, nowhere near me, until I asked for it back. She can be lovely too, though. Anyways, knitting is hard because I can't remember what I was doing. This counts as my extra-curricular blah-dee-blah for my resume.

Then, at the end of the day I talked to them about how I am going to teach (3 warnings, etc). It went alright. One kid put his hand up to say, ""I have a suggestion for you. If I were you, I would be more strict with us. We'll get used to it.""

Oh yes, friend, I shall be.

I need a fire lit under myself so that I plan my units instead of learning to knit via the internet (oh or loading my new iPod). Here's to hoping I catch that train away from procrastination station."

Thursday I got to go home as soon as I arrived due to snow. I was really hoping for no Friday yet was out of luck. I did sneak out early as to avoid presenting on my volunteer work.

This week I'm back at the elementary school. I'm trying to get unit planning, behaviour management system planning, etc in order but it's slow going. PRO-crastination. I'm incredibly lucky, as usual, to have an ever helpful sister at my side.

Monday was off to a good start. I really feel like my exercise (do I ever talk about anything else these days?) is helping me to be positive. I have way less dread, and more hope. I have more energy to engage the students and my sponsor teacher.

I have a lot of hope for improving the behaviour of this class, and for how much I will learn.

"event","For this entire semester, we have one week back up at the university (and maybe two other days sprinkled somewhere). So the first day up there was a joke. We played Jepoardy for way too long. Right now, when we have so much lesson planning to do, they had us there playing some silly game for two hours at the end of the day.

The next day was better because we got let out extremely early. Only half of the class showed up (it had snowed, but that wasn't the reason for a lot of the absences, they just didn't want to come). So this meant that I only had to show my video (of myself teaching) to a few people in a self-chosen group!

Today all the student teachers and school teachers (our sponsors/mentors) had a gathering (at a golf course, of course). I really enjoyed seeing my teacher in a new environment. I feel like that really helped us bond. Bonding took place often because we were making fun of something. Anyways, she's great. I have to teach 80-100%, and she totally is all over making it 80% (including her preps and library where the librarian takes over). I LOVE HER.

Then, at my table, we talked about the lifestyle in Cuba compared to here (some students just got back from their last practicum which took place in Cuba). We talked about socialism versus individualism and how that manifests in terms of attitude in schools. I even got to talk about intentional communities.

I'm really positive today, which is an extremely rare occurance as of late. I think it is because I went running last night with my roommate. I'm trying to exercise way more, because my depression is starting to overwhelm me. Starting tomorrow, I am going to try running every other morning (going to bed by 9pm, up by 5:30am). I'll lift weights once during the week and on the weekend. I'll go to one gym class (pilates?) each week. Or so the plan goes. However, the exercise changes my life... and makes me way better equipped for my days."

<b>Three Strikes</b>

<i>What</i>: You get two warnings, and the third time you do something you get the prestated consequence.
<i>How</i>: You will get a strike for being off task. This includes socializing while in or out of your desk, talking while the teacher is addressing the class or when a student has been asked to share with the class by the teacher, making too much noise at your desk, not getting your books out and avoiding the work, shouting or screaming, shouting out answers instead of raising your hand, lying to me, or saying something really mean to a classmate (what do I do if I didn't hear it and someone tells me it happened?).
<i>Consequence</i>: Once they've acheived three strikes, depending on how severe I believe their actions to have been (or if any of these spots already have a kid in them), they have to go sit in either:

a) the hallway until I call them back in

b) a classroom of a different age (pre-arranged with the teacher) for a half hour or until recess/lunch

c) or the office.

In each location they will take their work with them, and they will complete it (or complete it during recess/lunch or take it home and complete it during the next recess/lunch if it isn't done - I don't want to stay in with them though!). In the case of the office/classroom, I will have premade sheets ready where I will check off the reason they are being sent, sign my name, write the time, and get the signature of the other teacher or principal. 

After they've continued to misbehave, I will warn them that the next time will also mean a phone call/e-mail/letter to their parents. The worst part will be when I have to follow through.

For the ones who can't keep on task. I will have premade sheets where they write what they are going to get done during each part of the day (or something like that, more details later). Then they will write how they think they did, and I will do the same.

"event","This is how I see it: Public school takes some sort of random sampling of society. Albeit that sampling produces a different result dependent on where it was taken (Point Grey vs. North Delta). When I got out of high school, my life drastically improved, in no small part due to simply no longer being forced to spend time with people I didn't like. Post high school, I chose my friends and thus my bubble. Now, as a teacher, I am back with that cross-section which can prove difficult.

I'm into teaching about social justice and global warming, but I'm not into teaching that we have a chance to save ourselves... because I don't know that we do. However, I think that our daily actions still have the ability to relieve suffering in the future despite whether or not the planet survives.

Here's to becoming a great teacher, to managing one day to stop eating so much sugar, and to incorporating exercise back into my life."

"event","So I'm sitting here, in the morning. I got here brutally early considering I went to sleep just before midnight. I awoke at 5:30am, and eventually just decided to get up before my predetermined hour of 6. I came to school the earliest I ever have, and it's nice. Hence, this post. Today I teach all day, in French and I am pretty excited. I'm nervous for my lack of French, but it will be okay. There is a teacher-on-call coming in, and I'm not sure what I'm going to negotiate with them. I'm allowed to have them stay or go, depending on my preference. I'm certainly leaning towards the latter, to reduce my anxiety but I can also see the benefit of getting some new feedback. Also, I'd like to check in with what the TOC would prefer. If I send them out of my class, they might end up doing prep blocks for teachers whereas with me, the day would require much less actual work. Getting paid to do nothing can be pretty sweet, though make the day a tad slower.

<lj-cut>I'm not really thinking too much about what's going to happen today. I've got it all written down, and I'm just going to see how it plays out. I'm going to film myself again today... perhaps I should figure that out now. Well then, off to have tea and set up the camera.

I can't wait til I have a classroom where I can set things up. This classroom is really nice, but it's not exactly very decorated. I want to have tons of plants, and use them to create a wall enclosing a reading space. But really, I want to ask the kids what they want."

"event","I got to teach the first half of the day. It was an English day, and I kind of missed having to speak French, but it was useful to teach in my first language.

<lj-cut>The teacher didn't tell me what we were going to do other than that we had gym for the second block. So I planned for the first block and the time between recess and lunch. Once I got there, I found out that they had computers first block. So I didn't even have them for about forty minutes. The teacher kept coming in the class to grab stuff and it was making me nervous. I really wanted to be alone.

For gym, we voted on a game before hand, which took forever. By the time we got to the gym and had the game explained, we had about ten minutes. It was a bit ridiculous. It was because I had them suggest games, explain them, vote, and then explain the winning game in the gym. If I had just chosen a game for them, I think it would have been better (in this situation). The game wasn't even satisfying for a lot of them (it wasn't the version of the game that they had hoped).

Recess.

After recess, we did a story game where they each started a paper with the same sentence, then passed it clockwise and wrote the next sentence (according to my instruction: first sentence describes the setting). I don't really like clapping, and I usually just yell out ""Can I have your attention up hear for one second please?"" There was one point where it didn't work, and because I was alone (without being observed), I just stood there until they eventually regulated themselves. I was even considering telling them that I would take time off of recess but didn't. Woah.

The activity went fine, and the day went fine. It certainly wasn't anything too difficult.

The rest of the day wasn't too exciting. I filmed myself today, and am watching it right now. I watched it at lunch as well. It's pretty funny. I just seem so unimpressed. However, I think I look cute in my dykey way.

Later in the day, I had awesome talks with one of my sponsor teachers and another teacher at the school. My sponsor teacher and I were talking about this one student that we both have difficulty relating with. He can be incredibly annoying. I mentioned how I felt offended the time that he went off about how disgusting public transit was, this one special time that he had to take a bus. I think he was being overly dramatic and disrespectful to a public service and the public. That sounds vague but whatever. My sponsor teacher's reaction was to say that he is so gay, and he just doesn't know it yet. I was really speechless. My first thought was to say that I am so gay, and that I don't assume that he is gay. I also was weirded out by the association between drama and being gay. The kid's an actor, and he likes to be dramatic and vocal. This really doesn't mean he's gay. In the end, I said nothing...

Today I had two really annoying interactions with that particular student. <b>One:</b> So I'm taking attendance but the kids are all slowly trickling in. I start to write down 'absent' and 'late' even though I know a lot of the kids will end up being late instead of absent. I'm addressing each table and asking who is missing from that table. He comes up to me while I am taking attendance and tells me that usually the teachers call out names one by one. I explain to him that I am aware of that fact. He asks me if I don't think it would be more effective to do it the other way. <b>Two:</b> He told me that I should get a student to follow me around and film me. I reacted to quickly, telling him that it is not desirable to tell people that they 'should' do something. Basically I could have said ""You shouldn't say 'should'"" in terms of the way I reacted. Woops. Non-violent communication is awesome, but I sure don't seem to use it. I react a lot, frustration, annoyance.

Tomorrow I teach the entire day, in French! There is a sub coming, but I can decide whether I want them to stay in the room or to leave and help other teachers. I think it might be nice to get their opinion, but I'm not sure that I feel like I want someone watching me... even if I never have to see them again.

Yesterday I observed the grade three classroom that I will be teaching for all of next semester. There are good parts and bad parts to this situation. I will miss a lot of things from that grade six classroom, but whatever. There is twice in the school so far that I've mistaken the gender of a kid, but in this class I fear I may have used the wrong pronoun with them, since I assumed they were one sex before I found out my error after school. I hope not, that could have been insulting to them."

"event","So my lesson went badly again, but my teacher just praised me. She wasn't really watching.

I feel so weak up there, when I don't know the French vocabulary and when I haven't had enough sleep to speak properly. There are other reasons as well.

Whatever, it'll get better.

I talked to two teachers during recess about how I don't like the term 'gifted'. It doesn't say 'gifted in...', just 'gifted'. We don't allow all gifts to be demonstrated in the school system either. Plus, saying one person is gifted means that another is without gift. Blah blah.

Then at lunch I talked to my favourite teacher and found out that she is indeed queer. This is the first school I've been to where I don't hear ""you are so gay"". Apparently it's because she did workshops with every class in the school last year, and came out to everyone. Sounds like she did a really good job of the workshop. She also does workshops for teachers, etc. Amazing. She suggested two films:

<a href=""http://www.planetout.com/popcornq/db/getfilm.html?2095"">It's Elementary</a> and <a href=""http://worldofwonder.net/productions/networks/sundance/transgeneration.wow"">Transgeneration</a>

She also talked to me about a group called VESTA (or something) that works on topics such as how to bring transgender awareness to schools. STOKED!

I just found <a href=""http://www.womedia.org/straightlaced.htm"">Straightlaced</a>, a documentary about gender roles for teenagers. There's awesome documentaries by <a href=""http://www.womedia.org/"">Womedia</a>."

"event","I feel pretty gross, but I know it's just one more hurdle that I've surmounted. I will finish this program, I will finish this program, I will finish this program. I just hope that I feel better about it at some point... but part of that just has to do with my general outlook on life. I'm worried how much of the other part has to do with this job being ill-suited for me?

This is the second time I have been observed by a Faculty Associate from the university. This one is different than the first. The first left but will be back for my long practicum. This second one is different in that she gives more critique in terms of what could improve. The first hardly told me anything, and simply praised me. This second one told me:

<lj-cut><b>...that I should be more assertive.</b>
&rarr; that I need to always make sure that everyone is paying attention to me before I give out instructions.
&rarr; to never say ""you can maybe..."" but ""you must"" to the students.
&rarr; to make sure my expectations are clear (""I expect you to at least..."")
&rarr; make it clear that they have to speak in French.
<b>...to watch my French.</b>
&rarr; that I should make sure I know ALL the necessary French vocabulary before the lesson (the thing is, it was unexpected vocab, and I did know it, my mind just blanked but I should have asked a student for help).
&rarr; I need to use the subjunctive! (Il faut que vous fassiez, Je veux que tu saches)
&rarr; to correct obvious grammar mistakes (""Je va"" instead of ""Je vais"").
<b>...to plan better.</b>
&rarr; I need to have all my materials (which is obvious, I just didn't put enough time into it).
&rarr; to make the lesson as student centered as possible (I discussed an article without having them discuss it together at their tables, so obviously something I would want to do).
<b>...to direct the class better.</b>
&rarr; I need to move around the class more while giving instructions, and not stay at the front. This will help keep students on task (institution!).
&rarr; get one student from each table to obtain tools (pencil crayons) instead of having them just run over.
&rarr; to always ask if they understand and have a student restate the instructions (and have written instructions)."

"event","So today was my first French lesson. I taught about sturgeon. It's funny how I don't even think so much about handing out sheet after sheet anymore. My sponsor teacher praised the idea of how I gave them a True/False quiz in the beginning, as a way of engaging them. I'm just regurgitating pre-planned lessons, it wasn't my idea. Great, I supposedly engaged them. What about them engaging themselves by learning something of their choosing? What is this? I come in and say we are learning about sturgeon? It's me deciding what we are doing? There are 29 of them, all brilliant... where is their autonomy?

Other than that, it wasn't hard at all to teach the lesson in French. I'm sure I made many a spoken error, but it really just rolled out of my mouth. Rad.

I teach lessons four out of five days next week, and at least one day the week following. In that week following, I will also teach an entire day. It seems scary but I always arrive and realize I just have to do it.

Today I met with someone teaching in the highschool next door. It was great to talk while riding the bus home, but we didn't have enough time really.

Also, this morning I felt my first moment of elation about becoming a teacher since school started.

Ok I have to walk Emma, make dinner, and do schoolwork. I'll write more later, about the professional day I attended, the symphony field trip, etc."

"event","Immediately, upon returning to the class up at SFU, upon seeing my first
classmate and avoiding contact, I felt disgusted. I'm not sure how much I
am disgusted by the class, or myself.

<lj-cut>When I come up here, the students totally socialize with each other. I
don't. I don't want to. I honestly don't like socializing when I'm here.
I'm really not sure why. Yet I feel so awkward, being one of the only ones
avoiding being social.

I hate hearing ""Ca va?"" so many times. When people ask how you are, and
you feel like you have to say ""good"" or else something is wrong with you.
Something is wrong with me, and I'm sure it's a mixture of valid
frustration with this class, my inability to act, and my propensity for
depression/introversion/shyness/low self-esteem. Everyone asks ""how was
your placement?"" and everyone responds ""wonderful, so great"". Mine was
fine. I survived. I didn't think it was super, do you want to talk about
what we liked and didn't like?

The other vegan hippy is not here today. I'm curious.

One student let everyone know how the BC Dairy Foundation provides
teachers with great resources for a low price. Even though I don't talk in
class pretty much ever, I had to say something. ""I just want everyone to
realize that the BC Dairy Foundation is selling a product, and so their
resources will be skewed. Also, not all cultures drink milk, nor can every
person consume it."" The student responded in saying that ""All the doctors
say that it's healthy and..."" so I interrupted with ""No, not all doctors
say..."" And the teachers cut us off. He talked to me later and I explained
how the dairy and meat boards are on the food pyramid board (or were) and
thus it is skewed. Also, 'Meat and Substitutes' obviously makes meat
primary. And the dairy category... it doesn't even say 'substitutes'.

My energy was good though. I imagine it is due to the full nine hours of sleep I got the night previous."

"event","So someone magically found my journal, knew what school I am working at, and is working at the school next to mine. We'll get together during lunch the week of the 13th to talk about what weirds us out, and I'm stoked.

Today one student was cleaning out his desk and threw all of the paper into the garbage can. Colour me unimpressed. I asked him to please recycle it. He nodded, but didn't do it. I asked him again, and got the same response. So I asked him why. He said that the paper was now 'nasty' because it was in the garbage can. I ended up putting it in the recycling bin myself. I get rather annoyed by things like this, when they seem to just be being dramatic/difficult. I definitely wasn't as respectful of them today. I was tired.

In related news, today I acted more like uncomfortable teacher. I was authoritarian-like. It's weird. I think it has to do with being in this weird position. If one student hits another, I don't feel I have the position to have the whole class talk about hitting. All I can do is talk to that one student, and it feels futile.

I'm sad to be going back to the university next week. It's much more interesting in the elementary school.

A different teacher came in to teach them science. He's amazing. In an old teacher photo, he has a scraggly awesome beard. He rides his bike to work everyday. He told them to write some stuff down to give to him, and asked them to use the paper from the recycling bin. He's very animated. He's going to start doing vermicomposting in his classroom.

Perhaps I didn't mention that I found and bought a book (big spender) called <a href=""http://www.wormwoman.com/acatalog/Wormwoman_catalog_Worms_Eat_Our_Garbage_17.html""><u>Worms Eat Our Garbage: Classroom Activites for a Better Environment</u></a>, based off of Mary Appelhof's <u>Worms Eat My Garbage</u>. I'm stoked.

Did I also mention how the kindergarten teacher is amazing? We talked earlier about Homo-a-gogo, and the other day she came in and asked me if I saw <a href=""http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2755199""><u>Shortbus</u></a>.

I wonder if teachers ever leave some kind of 'thank you' for the custodian(s)."

"event","<img src=""http://www.michael-mitchell.ca/images/michael-photo.gif"" align=left vspace=4 hspace=8 border=1>So the uncomfortable teacher told me how she believes that these students are the future peacemakers of society. She seems pretty certain. I don't see how someone could determine that from this classroom.

On Monday we had <a href=""http://www.michael-mitchell.ca/"">Michael Mitchell</a> (go to that site, you can hear one of his songs) come in and sing songs for the school in the gym. Here are some of the things he taught the kids:

&rarr; Canada is the best country in the world.
&rarr; We go help stop countries from fighting, like we are doing in Afghanistan.
&rarr; The First Nations people taught us how to live in Canada (with no mention of anything else).
&rarr; That no one wants to engage in war with Canada because we are peacemakers.
&rarr; The reason there is no war here, compared to other countries, is because we are nice people. We do nice things, like open the door for eachother.
&rarr; That our animal is the beaver instead of the bear because beavers work hard and bears are lazy.

<lj-cut>I'm was so relieved that he didn't launch into ""Oh Canda"". During the Afghanistan part, I dropped my head into my hands in frustration, and the realized that I don't feel comfortable expressing myself in such a way in front of other teachers. Though I should mention that a poster is hanging in the staff room with a tagline of ""vote the bums out"" and George Bush Jr. and friends' faces on it. However uncomfortable I am with the use of the word 'bums', I am impressed that such a thing is on the wall.

Then in class, I picked up <a href=""http://kayakmag.ca/"">Kayak</a>, a kid's history magazine. I read about ""<b>Our</b> First Nations"".

A major issue for me, is shyness. For example, I saw what was perhaps a 3 or 4 year old on Hallowe'en, dressed in a sheep costume. Of course, it was kind of cute. I just stood there and smiled really warmly. Then the other student teacher came down the stairs. Seeing the same thing, she totally engaged the parent and then the child in conversation. I have fears of engaging. Consequently, I am not making enough use of my French either.

It's a weird place to be. I am in a class, and I see interactions taking place among students. There are times that I would like to say something, to intervene, to try and set up a new system with them which would avoid certain problems, but I can't. So I either simply observe or ask them to stop doing something.

Then I wonder, when things I don't like are transpiring... is it right for me to step in? I have to realize that my requirements are not necessarily theirs. It makes more sense for me to state how I am feeling uncomfortable about a certain situation, and ask them what they think. I wonder though, when I think that one or a few students are disrespecting others, am I allowed to talk about this with them as a group? Will it not embarrass or frustrate those kids if I do so? Can I address it as a situation in which they are not at fault, but that might need new solutions? It seems to me that involving the whole community in a positive way (stating feelings and needs, not judging) would be much better than my being the dictator or addressing them alone. However, even if this made sense (please give me feedback, though I can't imagine anyone reading this far), I certainly don't feel comfortable applying it during my practicum. We are in such a strange place of authoritarian/submissive to the students and the teachers respectively. I don't appreciate either role.

All the stress combines, and I wonder, ""Is this really a job that I can or should do?"" Yes and whatever. I can do the job in that there are plenty of teachers of varying abilities/motivations doing so. Whether I should do a job or not is such a grey area. When it comes down to it, I am going to do this job. I will have $20K of student loans to pay off, and I want to be financially stable. Riding on the bus today (I love riding the bus for the time it gives me to mull), I was mentally fixated on how cold I was. This led to my chanting, ""I will finish this program"" in my head. I am through with living in dilapidated rental homes. I want stability and a higher quality of life. Every morning, on that bus, I travel from what is mentioned to be the poorest community in Canada (how true that is, I know not) through the business center of downtown, eventually ending up in one of the richer areas of this city. I don't want to ignore it, but I also don't know what to do with my feelings of frustration.

To continue with my doubts regarding this career: I think that there are good things that I can do. I think that all will change, in terms of my ability to be a good person, once I am left alone in a classroom. I also know that I can change careers.

I am incredibly nervous to speak French with the grade sixes, to deliver an entire unit in French. Teaching is hard enough without being done in your second language.

Today I was in a different class with the comfortable teacher, to spice up things. She left me alone with them numerous times. I turned into this authoritarian monster. I felt really angry. They can become really dramatic about things. They also can start all yelling about something and it just becomes too intense for me. They were all upset that some students were sitting on the sofa when it was not their turn. Before I figured out what to do, they were all yelling and getting really upset. My first instinct was just to get them to all be quiet, so that's what I did. Before any of this happened, they had already kind of sorted it out... but not in a respectful manner. This kind of thing was out of my control because I had no idea what were the rules for the sofa.

On Monday, when I did my third and final lesson, the comfortable teacher asked if I wanted her to focus on anything in particular during the observation. I have no idea how to respond because I don't care. I mentioned that she could watch to see if I only respond to raised hands. She explained how she doesn't really believe in using that idea. She feels that they are old enough to negotiate space. Now, the thing is, in her class today I saw this: four kids with raised hands, waiting patiently. Then one kid shouted something out and she listened to him. I think that's unfair. I think that only repsonding to the loudest voice in unfair. In our collectives, as adults we sometimes function that way... but in my experience it does drown out the timid. Though less natural, I am into having a speaker's list. I'm also intrigued by the idea of having one student each day, responsible for writing down who is next to speak based on when they rose their hands. This means that they don't have to leave their hands in the air, and that they are not picked to speak arbitrarily by myself. This also means that perhaps I will have to raise my own hand?

I was also thinking about how in the first week of class, it would be great to just hang out and get to know eachother. To start figuring out how we are going to run our community. How great it would be to have them figure out how they want the room set up.

There is a substitute teacher in her first year at my school, and I always eat lunch with her. I really like talking with her. There is a student teacher from the other university there as well, and he is swamped with work. I am so lucky that I chose not to attend that school.

Two more days there, then I go back to the university. I am petrified of having to do my long unit in French in an intermediate classroom... the end of November. So happy that my long practicum will likely be in grade three."

Small, but really smart on her part because it really did make me feel safe. She read me out her commentary after, and it was all positive (not that finding out ways to improve is a bad thing).

I had fun, and it was in English so that made it easy.

I'd talk more about class but I have to make a lesson plan for tomorrow."

She got me to mark tests which took me basically all day. I'm not there to mark her tests. I have a lesson to do tomorrow, and I could have been working on that. She wants me to call the aquarium and find out if we can do a field trip in relation to the white sturgeon unit I will be teaching.

Today I feel less happy about my day. However, I'm still looking forward to the day I am in a classroom as the 'teacher'.

Actor kid went off about how Madonna should not be allowed to wear bikinis on stage because she's old. We talked and I expressed how I don't think that people's liberties should be restricted unless they are inciting or being violent, or restricting the liberties of someone else. I compared it to how some people would like to ban homosexuality. Then he went off on this long string of flattery, about how I could convince anyone of anything and how I'm so smart. He's very precocious.

Some kid from another class was asking me for book, and I felt so happy when we exchanged names. I feel like I can talk to them in a humanizing respectful way. Makes me realize that I actually want to be hanging out with them. I really like interacting with them. I'm stoked.

Today I feel really safe here. The kids don't make fun of me, the teachers are supportive, they even speak English with me.

I am so much more confident than I used to be in the classroom (other factors for this than the passage of time?).

I feel angry when I see the boys being hyper, when they demand so much attention. I hear myself saying negative things about them in my head. I'm not sure how much I want to be someone who says ""don't"". When is it necessary to say something? When am I just being a jerk?"

"event","I watched them do a hip hop dance, all 95%+ whities. Not that I'm a racist, I swear. The song was <a href=""http://www.dapslyrics.com/display.php?sid=15195"">Get It Poppin'</a>. Here is an excerpt:

<i>I got that no limit American Express card
Mami you can get whatever you like
Plus I got that all-black Phantom it's tinted on four sides
Go 'head kiss it, they can't see us inside
Mami tell me do you like - it, I know you like - it
It's written all over your face don't fight - it
You like - it, more than I like - it
So put it all over your face don't bite - it
From rags to riches, club packed with bitches
Had to bag them digits, her head game was vicious (muah)
And we can get it poppin in the bathroom
Don't be selfish ma, go ahead and pass it to him
Then we can all fuck
It's like a million on my neck, got all of these bitches all struck
Aowww! We pissy drunk off of Seraphim
I'm up in V.I.P. and these bitches are screamin let me in</i>

Teacher #2 (I have 2) is awesome. She's all into the yoga and really sweet. We keep talking about the Madonna adoption, which is interesting. We're talking about how she adopted a kid who still had a father in Malawi (a father who put him in adoption because he couldn't afford to care for him), and how she could have easily helped that father out financially and adopted a parentless kid. This one kid in class was getting all hostile and yelling out how he didn't care. It was interesting.

Sometimes I think about how unconventional my haircut is, and how I have a tattoo. I'm happy that I feel more confident about these things, in comparison to previous experience in schools.

One kid in my class has been cast in a pilot for a CBC television show. When someone else in the class asked how much he will make, the teacher told them that it was not okay to ask such a question. I disagree.

Immersion is interesting. Immersion in a rich neighbourhood is interesting.

Today I got to work on my laptop in the back of the class. I worked on my lesson plans (which is nice since I think it's ludicrous to expect us to do tons of work outside of our 40 hours/week. I also could take more notes on my observation of the class.

The kids are super nice. I've never been in such a welcoming class, I don't think. I remember when I shaved part of my head (kind of like now), kids in another school called me ugly. That was harsh. I still haven't started to talk to them much. I feel shy, and I don't want to be all awkward with them. I also don't want to invade their space or assume that they should talk to me. However, we exchange smiles and it is nice. Today I walked around and got their names, to write them down on a map for myself. It was a good starter, to make contact with each of them... and I memorized all of the names. Easier than I had previously thought.

I really need to go back to yoga class. After school I went for a run with Emma and it felt so awesome.

When I teach, I really want to continually improve. I think it would be useful to invite people into the class to give suggestions after watching me... and to tape myself (with parental permission)."

<lj-cut>We talked about how teachers can get fired, even if they do something that is not actually illegal. One teacher was fired for being topless beside her husband in a photo that appeared in a magazine. Fired. They essentially told us that we have to appear morally 'sound' to all of the parents. This is the kind of mentality that keeps homosexual teachers in the closet. <b>This</b> is morally reprehensible.

I love how they give us no in-class time to work on our lesson plans for next week. Thanks dudes.

I finished reading Matt Hern's <u>Field Day</u>. I certainly think that for many kids, having a learning centre as opposed to a school would be wonderful. I also think there are some kids who might prefer school the way it is (though that certainly was not me).

I'm now reading Alfie Kohn's <a href=""http://www.alfiekohn.org/books/pbr.htm"">Punished by Rewards</a>. I don't think I am going to start riding my bike to school because the bus provides me with valuable reading time, and reading these books is what keeps me sane (so I feel like I'm learning somewhat self-directedly).

I'm excited about my future, outside of this program. I'm excited for what I will learn in public schools, and what I will create outside of it. And I'm still not nervous about teaching in front of people, it's all very banal."

"event","The professors haven't talked to me about being away yesterday. Lovely. I think that more and more, students are feeling motivated to take a day off as they see fit (though our booklet tells us that we are not allowed to miss any days save extenuating circumstances). Yesterday was so wonderful for me, and I'm so happy that I took it. I just walked around east van with Emma, in the sun.

<lj-cut>Well we had a different speaker until lunch, talking to us about classroom management.

I will make it through this program because I think I should. However, I'm constantly questioning what people tell me, because that's what I do.

I still have problems with the idea of consequences for students not doing the task we want them to do. When you come into a room, and tell them what they are going to do, shouldn't you expect a little resistance from at least some of them? They don't choose to be there... though some certainly might.

I'm reading Matt Hern's book <a href=""http://www.mightymatthern.com/fieldday.html"">Field Day</a>. I am obviously really drawn to the idea of self-directed study, to trusting that students will learn what they need to learn on their own with requested guidance. I was wondering if you could work your way around curriculum by giving the students a list of what they are 'supposed' to learn in that year, say for social studies. Then they can do self-directed projects on whatever topic they see fit. It'd be cool to say ""I can teach a lesson on this or that"" and have students request the lesson. Then I could teach that lesson in a separate part of the room (or kids could go pursue their self-directed study in the library or elsewhere) and those who wanted to attend, could.

I've said it before, but I think I retained next to no knowledge from public school. I might as well have studied what I liked.

Also, how do you get students involved in the community on a regular basis?

AND, I want to find or start a website where teachers can talk about how to radicalize the education system, a place to exchange and find ideas."

"event","<lj-cut>I know I complain a lot. I hate this program. I think about how if I don't make it through, I'll have to take it as a blessing and move on. I don't look forward to teaching in public schools, though I entertain that I will like it more once I get there. At the very least, I'm willing to do it for a couple years to get out of debt.

I certainly could use more self-confidence, especially in class. I choose not to talk to anyone most of the time, and that probably just makes my day seem more boring and longer. A classmate told me to have a baby, because that would put things in perspective. She was kidding, of course.

It's such crap. I don't feel motivated by this program at all, and it's not that I can't feel motivated by things.

And I feel like I'm supposed to fake happiness there. I can't, it's simply not possible. Often I feel like I am less happy, less stable than the others... and I think it's true. I mean, there's the idea that it's not a sign of health to be well adjusted to an unhealthy society... but really, I could certainly focus on the positive and enjoy my life more."

"event","Positive, positive, positive! Today I shall see all the good in the world.

<lj-cut>Today wasn't so bad, except that I was killer tired. I decided not to drink coffee today (I've pretty much drank it every single day since the beginning of last week. I felt better without it, but tired. I don't know how these teachers keep their energy up.

These kids are from rich families. Wealth disparity. Always impressive.

There's something strange. Well plenty. Teachers talk to me about why they are making a lesson like this or that, and it all goes over my head. It's too much. Plus it all seems to be about content and not community. I want to learn how to interact with students. Teachers never talk to me about questions they have as to how to better support students, and they never engage me in dialogue. They just talk at me, and want me to agree with them or praise them.

Today I helped some grade sixes with math, in French. The language barrier makes it harder. I helped some people, and it felt decently good. However, there were two boys I talked with... and I just felt that our exchange was not working. I felt like they wanted me to leave them eventhough I was pretty sure they still didn't understand. Part of this unsuccessful exchange has to do with the limitations in how I could present the material to the student. They were working on multiplication/division/subtraction/addition of numbers to the power of another number. They were doing it in their books. I just feel like there has to be a more concrete or tactile way of explaining the concept to them. Presenting it on an overhead as it comes to you, and then having them do exercises on paper is so limited in terms of presentation. All numbers, all written, all talk. It felt really stunted and unrewarding for some.

Also, today I noticed that they never open the windows in this class. Nor is there 'enough' decor in the room. More plants are needed. More a lot of things... more student directed decor.

Oh the things I will do."

"event","I've been so sick of talking about school that I haven't been writing (though there is plenty to write about). The weekend seems too short as well.

So this being my fourth week, I will spend the first 3 days in a classroom in Point Grey (rich area!) observing. The last two days are slated for volunteering, which I haven't found yet. 3 day week!

I feel a sort of sick dread about today. Meeting new people, speaking in French with them, participating in a grade six classroom. I feel a lot of excitement as well. I suppose the most feared activity would be that of having to converse with the teachers in the staffroom, in French.

One day, though, I will be out of this program. I had a dream last night that one of my professors was telling me that they were sending a letter home about me. They felt that I was not doing very well in the class, and that I had mental issues to deal with. Apparently the second letter could mean expulsion.

<lj-cut text=""And my first day of observation...""><b>Observation Day 1.</b>

Well. Sometimes I look at the classroom, and I see kids that are super bored. I would be. I still am, in my classes. Is that just an attitude? Is it just reality? Would self-directed study help some of them? Would apprenticeships help others?

It seems overwhelming, leading 30 students. How do you engage that many people during all 5 hours of the day, each day? Also, when do you make really awesome less plans, especially if you are a full time teacher?

Sometimes I think, ""I should drop out, there is no way I want to do this."" But other times I think, ""This could be really rad."" I just don't know if I'm capable of radicalizing it as much as I'd like. I suppose that's when you get a group of rad teachers together and work it."

"event","Woah, today was the best day ever. The best day I've <b>ever</b> had in university.

<lj-cut>I'm a bit overwhelmed with how to get this out in writing.

First I was in such a posi mood, due in part to having drank coffee. I'm hoping not to become a coffee drinker. There were definitely moments in the day where I could feel its negative effects. I was jittery, and not quite calm. I hope to replace it with biking part way to school in the morning, yoga once per week, and a dance class once per week (the last might be too many things on my plate, but it would be so amazing).

So I ran into my friend Kathleen on the bus, which was great. I really like you tons Kathleen. We had wonderful conversation, which really started my day off right.

Then when I got into class, I was instantly social. I approaced the vegan, L, and chatted her up. I just was feeling so good.

Today was a day of speakers. Our first speaker talked about multiculturalism. She teaches Mandarin at the university, so talked to us about the differences between asian cultures and our own. She mentioned how China has a 5,000 year old history, whereas our own is only around 500. I interjected to say that we need to recognize the culture that was here before us, of aboriginals, and got shot down by another classmate (""Yeah, but we're talking about 'our' culture, as a country.""). I told her that I knew what we were talking about, I just wanted to mention previous cultures. Anyways, I felt a bit uncomfortable and unhappy after the exchange, but then negotiated myself mentally into a state of posi again. I was happy with what I had said. Anyways, the multiculturism talk was really amazing. I was super into it.

Then there was a presentation on aboriginals in schools. It was amazing and I cried lightly a few times. Once I thought I would have to leave the room. However, the talk also brought to mind other issues that I didn't get to address (I had already had my fair share of questions). It was just that they applauded their ability to keep more aboriginals in the school system, without really critiquing the school system itself. I could explain more, but I'm too tired.

Then at lunch I started to talk to L about the talk and the program. K and later D joined us. We talked about everything: what we don't like about this program, what we don't like about the educational institution, what we think creates a better world, etc. We talked throughout the hour lunch and into the class time until I made a comment about how we were possibly missing class. Apparently one of the teachers scolded D about it.

Then we had two francophone women talk to us about their work with impoverished francophone people in Vancouver. They were great. They bashed the Olympics, capitalism, all kinds of things. It was amazing.

The end, for now. It was the best day. I felt so validated."

"event","Hey kids,

<lj-cut>I've been thinking about homeschooling and free schools a lot. I've got some tabs open, but no time to read them. I seem to be going without sleep tonight. Perhaps that is due, once again, to drinking coffee too late into the day (this time after 8pm). I'm inexperienced and haven't learned yet. However, it must be said that I am getting many a thing done. Hopefully I'm not going to get sick.

I feel convinced that forcing kids to attend class is totally counter-intuitive to helping them."

"event","So friends, today felt pretty lovely. Perhaps it was the three hours of sleep.

<lj-cut>Granted, I was sickly tired nearing the end of the day. However, I felt super posi. Basically our three teachers taught us as if we were a grade four class. It was nice to see their different activities/strategies. We read a good article last night regarding the benefits of cooperative learning.

We also had to do one of those personality type questionaires. I tend to find those annoying. I see myself as a multitude of things depending on when and where... etc. I'm not always introverted. During this discussion, where many people ate up their 'personality type', we were to talk of behaviours that annoy us. One woman talked about how she can't stand lazy people. Lazy people? What are those? She is annoyed by people who don't give 100%, but give 50%. I told her that I thought everyone did their best in that moment. She vehemently disagreed. I think that in most cases where someone might be stereotyped as lazy, the person either realizes that the work in question isn't that important to them, something else is of more importance, or they might be dealing with some kind of mental health issue at the time. In any case, I don't think that calling someone lazy is really necessary. It doesn't motivate people to change by any positive means. It's funny that I write this, since I often call myself lazy, almost to beat people to the punch (when they probably weren't throwing it anyways). I'm scared of this woman as a teacher. She's an intense perfectionist (self-identified), and calls people lazy. Dude.

I felt more comfortable around people today. It was nice. Comfort is nice. I am also feeling more comfort in speaking up in class. Lovely.

A few days back, we put these folders on the wall with our photos on them. People walked around and wrote nice things about people in them. It's pretty silly. We mostly just all told eachother how nice we were. La dee da.

I'm still reading The Compassionate Classroom. It's pretty rocking. Check out <a href=""http://www.cnvc.org/feelings.htm"">feeling words</a>.

I can't imagine lasting as a teacher in the public school system. Grades?! Curriculum?! Meh, we'll see. I'm thinking more and more how incredibly excited I am that I am in teaching school. I am on my way to having a decent job. Amazing.

I wonder what other people think about curriculum. It seems to me like there are many ideas, perhaps. One is that curriculum is necessary, and that children will not learn all the necessary skills needed in society unless we force them (math until grade 11 for example). Another being that forcing kids to take math til grade eleven, social studies until grade 11, and such, allows people to be prepared for a myriad of different options when they leave school. The way I feel, however, is that I took nearly nothing from all my public school years of social studies. I'm not sure that I know anything from those years. I just did the work. I think that I have basic abilities in mathematics, but probably from a grade 4 or 5 level? I mostly just use a calculator. As for english, the same applies. It's that if I wanted to use any of these skills, I would have to relearn them. If I hadn't kept up with French, most of that would have left me (I didn't do immersion). And yes, perhaps I am taking basic instilled knowledge for granted. I'm unsure. My point is, I feel that most of what we force students to learn in K-12 is pointless. I feel like it's a waste of time. I question whether they wouldn't be best served by self-directed projects. Anything that they took interest in would likely end up incorporating math, english, and social studies. If we want them to be physically active, perhaps we could offer courses in different things (yoga, tennis, running, whatever). They could sample them and do what they like. And it's not that school is some great place to learn social skills. In my opinion it was more damaging. It would have been better to be out in the community at large, with various ages of people (not festering in a pool of your hormonally driven peers). Basically, unless you're into someone telling you what to do all the time, what's the point of the school in its current form? It's an institution that deals with the issue of 'what to do with the children'. Honestly, that's what I'm feeling about it at the moment. I was most definitely interested in animals, their behaviour, their care, their rights, all through my schooling. What would have happened if I were able to pursue that topic in a more detailed way? It's possible that I wouldn't have gotten to the end of my schooling career having just jumped through hoops in order to get into post-secondary. When there, I suddenly had to choose a career (and what careers did I know of? perhaps if I had been allowed to specialize earlier, I would have known more about my options). I honestly decided that I wouldn't be able to find a job with animals that I wanted. Family pressure? Now I'm going into the public school system, and teaching French. Mind you, I think that's pretty awesome in some ways. I'll figure it out. I remember talking to my father at one point, crying about how I shouldn't have ended up here... and he offered to put me through school all over again. No thanks. I'm at a point where I want to start making money, and it feels too late to restart. I've gone forward with French, and so that's where I am going. I just think that the public education system didn't work for me. I only continued with French because I had started and because you needed a language to get into university. Oh, irony. For language, we would have been better served going to a country that spoke the language rather than simply learning it here. Oh public education, and your many hoops."

"event","What to say of today? So tired. I really just wanted to go home. This course is ridiculous. Seriously, jumping through hoops, give me the carrot.

<lj-cut>We did an ice breaker (some games, for fun), answered some questions to an article (ie. What kind of journal do you write in? How did you start writing? FUCK YOU, YOU ARE WASTING MY TIME.). Learned some group strategies to use in classrooms (acutally useful, thank you). I can't remember what else we did.

Love that I'm speaking French every weekday. Going to do my volunteer experience at Spartacus Books, perhaps the five French hours at Sophia's Books? Don't know. Know of any good French volunteering opportunities?

Almost two weeks down, 11 to go this semester.

We were asked to write about diversity. I wrote, in my journal, about how there is some kind of grey line where diversity of beliefs gets confusing. When a child believes that homosexuality is wrong, I am allowed to teach that it is not wrong. However, this is a recent law passed. This is a law that protects me from parental wrath (I've never experienced it, don't know how much I really need worry). But what of transgendered people (transgenderism?)? Can I teach that that is okay, and not wrong? I would have wanted to be the teacher that taught about homosexuality being okay before it was seemingly tolerated by society. What's more important? That kids learn to respect transgenderism, and that they can honor it in themselves if it so exists? That parents not flip out on me, and possibly their kids? This is the question I pose my teachers, and I have fear in that (they read our journals). Will they be upset with me? Will they be upset with me that I write mostly negative things in my journal? Will I shatter their ego, and will they take it out on me? I wrote of how the yarn game had me feeling sad, and how it hurts people.

BENT tonight was wonderful. So worth getting no sleep. 3 hours max? This city is so full of amazing people, it's incredible. It's funny that I now feel so posi. For one reason or another, I need it to be this way right now. No time for negativity at the moment."

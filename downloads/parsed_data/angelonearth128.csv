"event","i can't believe how happy i am! Its like even when I'm only on the phone with drew, it seems like everything else in the world stops. As every day goes by, i think more and more that he might actually be ""the one"". I never thought that I could feel so strongly about someone this early into the relationship. But then again, it MUST be possible, because that's how I feel. I just wish that his one friend wasnt still in the picture. I mean, I completely trust him. I know he would never do anything to hurt me, it's just her that I don't entirely trust. I mean, she's made it clear in the past that she has feelings for him. She claims now that she's fine with being friends and is happy for him being in a relationship, but I find that hard to believe. I'm just scared that she's gonna do something. I don't know what, but you know how sometimes you just get that feeling about someone? well i have that feeling about her. But oh well. Nothing I can do about it. It's kinda scary actually. He tells me that he hopes that this is his last relationship and how he wants to marry me someday. It's so amazing. I never thought that someone could feel that way about me. I just hope to god that he ends up going to kent next year so there's a bigger chance that someday we can get married. He makes me happier than I have ever been before in my life. I just wish he didn't live an hour away. It's so hard..... by the next time we see each other it'll have been over two weeks without us seeing each other. But hopefully we'll make it work. I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost him. I care about him more than anyone else on earth. well, I guess thats all for now. talk to you later!

"event","i dunno whats wrong w/ me today. Maybe its just one of those days when you just feel down for no reason. who knows. all i know is that im not happy today. every time drew leaves it gets harder and harder to say goodbye to him. im not saying that i want to end things..... just the opposite. he's absolutely amazing. I don't know what I would've done w/o him last night. as of right now, i can see us being together for a long time...... but it just scares me whats gonna happen next year. i mean.... yea.... hes hoping to go to kent next year..... but what if for some reason he doesn't get in or changes his mind and goes to bgsu? whats gonna happen to us? i guess i'm just scared. i care about him more than anything, and im terrified that somethings gonna happen to make me lose him. I dunno.... maybe its just the fact that its getting close to the holidays and its my first time being away from home for so much of it. Maybe thats it.,... or at least part of it.... maybe im just homesick. who knows. well im out. *later*"

I finally got away from brittany.... im in a new dorm now in a different hall. I like it..... its different, but i think i'll get used to it eventually. My rm seems really nice. things with drew couldnt be better.... I thank god every day that I met him.... he is most definately the best thing in my life right now :) I don't like the whole hour difference thing, but he's been making it up here about once a week to see me, so i guess its not so horrible. It's like i told robin yesterday.... theres something different about him.... i can't really explain it.... I just feel like there's more of a connection between us. I really can't explain it. lol. is he ""the one""? I don't know. He very well could be, and honestly..... I hope he is. I'm almost a different person since i've met him, and I like it. True this whole brittany situation has really brought down my self-esteem, but it would be a hell of a lot worse if drew weren't in my life. I don't know what i'd do if i had never met him. I was thinking the other day, and ya know the song ""the one"" by daniel bedingfield? thats how i feel. well, i gotta head out..... wish me luck w/ drew..... hes coming out tomorrow!!!!!! i cant wait!!!!!! talk to ya later!"

He's coming out here on wed....... i cant wait! its gonna be great talking to him in person instead of on the phone. lol. but i guarantee that since i want it to be wed. at 3 00, the next 3 days are gonna go by super slow. lol. but as long as it gets here i guess i dont mind too much.  but its time for me to start writing my speech for communication class. i'll talk again later. love yall! *muah*"

I dunno.... i miss that. but on the plus side, ive found a new website- myspace.com. I actually like it better than hotornot.....people actually talk on this one and there not as judgemental. ive met 3 guys from here so far online, and there all awesome. not like any of the guys i met on hotornot. these guys actually talk to me and make me feel special. i cant really explain it, but i like it. all three of these guys are awesome... luckily none of then live too far away so the possibility of meeting in person is always there. well, im gonna go talk to my guys some more cuz there awesome. lol. i'll write again later if im feeling like it. *muah*"

"event","I had sooooo much fun last night. its unbelievable. I now officially love college. I also love the internet, cuz thats how i meet people. lol. so I talked to mike from hotornot yesterday and he invited me over to drink last night after my floor meeting. So he picked me up and went back to his condo to drink. It was great. Brit was acting like my mother, as usual, since it was just the two of us but it was actually kinda funny. Mike started out by making me his ""specialty drink"".  Surprisingly, I really liked it. I always figured I'd like mixed drinks better than just straight up stuff, but this drink was amazing. It didnt even taste like it had alcohol in it at all- the best kind of drink in my book. Then he made me 4 strawberry daqueries- gotta love those. All this time, surprisingly, I was downing my drinks faster than he was downing his beer. True he had more, but I don't drink as much as he did. He taught me how to play the card game speed, and then we decided to call brit, since he knows her from hotornot too. So we made a bet about how she would react if we told her I was passed out drunk. I ended up losing the bet by saying she'd either freak out or laugh, so I had to take a shot. He made me actually 2 shots of starburst- another good one. Needless to say I got a little tipsy last night. Ok so maybe more than a little, but the point is that I had fun, right? lol. Its amazing that I'm not more upset about what happened tues. night. oh well. gotta move on, and im doin just that. I think mike and I really hit it off last night and we had sooo much fun together. We both agreed that neither one of us wants a relationship right now- waaaaay too much stress. So it works out great! We can go out and have a good time, but we also get to go out w/ other people too.  Well, time to go...... goin out to party w/ brit tonight, and gonna have a blast. I can't wait till we go out saturday night.... every college girl's dream- 2 girls 7 guys. lol. I'm gonna let myself drink, but not as much as last night, because I don't exactly remember a lot about last night. lol. Well, i'm off now. later"

Even the one person that I should have the strongest relationship with seems to not really like me. I don't know if that's true or not, but it certainly seems that way. Its like am I that bad of a person or that ugly of a person that no one really likes me for me? I've been noticing that a lot lately. People only seem to like me because they want something. I don't know..... maybe that's not true at all.... but it certainly seems that way lately. That bothers me more than anything when people aren't upfront with you about how they feel and what they're thinking.Well, I'm going to bed now because I have nothing better to do."

"event","things with me just keep getting better and better. If I were talking in person, you'd be able to tell that i'm being sarcastic. the weekend started out ok..... I called Lisa, cuz I needed to get out of the dorm and be with friends so I wouldn't cry. She was going to the stow football game w/ one of her friends, so I went with them. That was kinda fun. Really cold, but ok. We left after halftime, and met up w/ pat and 2 of his friends. We were hangin out here at the dorm then decided to go to the diner sort of down the street and get some food. so we went, but i wasnt hungry so I didnt get anything. We had fun there..... I always heve so much fun when I'm with them. They're all hilarious- especially when chad and pat are together. lol. So were sitting there and all of the sudden I start getting stomach pains really really bad. So to make a long story short, Pat,lisa, and mary ended up taking me to the emergancy room. THAT was scary. first the ambulance came and looked at me and reccomended that I go and get thecked out at the ER. So I went and they brought me into the back. Thank god Lisa was allowed to stay with me..... I don't know what I would have done if I would have had to stay back there by myself. So I had like 4 different doctors come and look at me, they took some tests, and finally after like 2 and a half hours, the one doctor said that  it was most likely the antibiotic I was on for my sinus infection. I thought medicine is supposed to make people better, not send them to the ER. lol. So they gave me medicine to stop the pain and then gave me a new perscription. So we left the ER at like 3 30 in the morning. lol. I got home and went straight to bed. lol. That stuff definately knocked me out. I slept till like 12 30 the next day and then fell asleep again later in the day. lol. do I went to bed around 3 this morning and slept till 10 30. I ordered my halloween costume last night..... I'm so excited!!!!! Its a fairy costume.... Me, lisa, and mary are going to the big street party sunday. And Tom's coming out tonight and takin me  out to dinner..... i'll be glad to see him, even though i just saw him last weekend. Well, thats bout it for now. I'll write again later.   *me*"

We started watching some of his old high school videos- he hasnt changed at all- still as cute as ever. lol. then, after that, there were the gifts, since it was sweetest day AND our one month anniversary saturday(this all took place after midnight). He bought me a webcam so that we could see each other over the internet, and so I'd be up to date w/ technology. hehe. and then he burned me a mix cd w/ 16 really sweet songs on it..... I cried. I'm kinda embarassed about that, but ya know..... thats me.. then saturday we slept in, made pancakes at 3:00 in the afternoon. lol. then we went downstairs and watched OSU.... not a good game. lol. That night, he took me to a barons game..... I'd never been to a hockey game before, so it was kinda interesting..... a little too violent for my liking, but still not bad. then we came home and watched our movies.....I fell asleep for the second one. lol. And that was our weekend. I can't wait to have another one....It's amazing how happy I am when I'm with him..... its like all my troubles go away when were together.

Not to say that I'm in a bad mood or anything, I just dont know what I am right now. LOL. I guess I'm just jealous. I know that in reality, I have no reason to be jealous, yet I still am. why can't I be the type of person that is just happy 24/7? I guess I just want the cinderella life. I want to meet prince charming and for everything to be perfect.... not that I don't adore having tom in my life.... I do. Theres just been a change in our relationship lately. I've talked to him about it, and it just ends up making me even more upset. I guess I just don't like hearing the truth sometimes. like last night.... I asked him a question, and he told me the truth... most people like being told the truth... I usually do to, but not last night... I dunno... Maybe I'm just way too high maintenence for anyone... maybe thats whats been wrong lately with me and tom- i'm too high maintenance. But what can I do about it? Its not something I can just change overnight. I guess in reality, tom's right- I am a baby. sometimes I just wish I could just snap my fingers and life would go exactly like I want it to. but this is reality... I know that'll never happen, so I guess I'll just have to deal with it.. I'm sorry if I've been doing nothing but complain lately, but isn't that what a journal's for? I can't talk to anyone about it because no one understands. My roommate has guys willing to do anything and everything for her, so she wouldn't get it.... guys don't know how hard it is to be a girl, so I can't talk to tom about it(plus I feel horrible constantly crying to him- what can he do?), so I guess my best bet is a journal. If anyone out there has ANY advice whatsoever, I'm always open to suggestions. Well, I think i've done all the complaining anyone can take, and for those of you who are still reading this, thanks for sticking around. Well, I guess I'm done.

My proffessor wasnt too thrilled with my last work, so I actually finished my journal yesterday, and it isnt even due till tonight! Now I just gotta start on my rough draft for that evil paper. lol. Maybe I'll start that tonight then go work out. Sounds like a plan. I didnt go workout yesterday, so now i feel fat.

"event","I'm determined to make today a better day.... I realize now how close I probably came to losing tom because of my bitchiness. I can't let that happen. Work was good. Lisa came by to visit and brought me balloons..... she is such a sweetie! That totally made my day better. And then I got home and talked to tom without crying- progress! Plus, i found out that tom is hopefully coming out later this week! I can't wait for that. Im just hoping now that I don't end up getting sick, because it seems like everyone around me is. Brittany is just getting over mono, two of my co workers have colds, and i found out sunday that one of my other friends has mono now too. yikes. not a good sign for me. oh well. what can I do, right? Ive got psych today- wonder how horrible I did on last thursdays test. It was pretty bad. Wonder if she'll even have grades posted today. Who knows. well, i'm off to go back to sleep for an hour or too. Love ya!"

"event","i hate myself right now.... i was hoping that today would be a better day, but instead its turning out to be a hell of a lot worse.. i swear... i don't know what else could possibly go wrong in my life right now.... i think im losing the one guy i care about more than anyone else in the entire world, and it's all my fault. so really i have no one to blame but myself. maybe if i wasnt so high strung things would be different. maybe if we didnt live an hour apart things would be different.maybe if i wasnt such a baby... so many maybes right now its making me sick. all i've been doing is cry, because i don't know what else to do right now. he tells me not to worry, but what else can i do? im scared that every time hes mad at me, hes gonna dump me and completely break my heart. I've already had a broken heart once, and it wasnt pretty. I admit- it got to the point where i couldn't be alone because i was afraid of what i would do. I don't want to go through that again. I'm scared that if i get a broken heart this time, i really will end up soing something i'll regret. I'm feelin like i shouldnt be alone right now, and things havent even ended b/t me and tom.... pretty scary!  my roommate isnt much help.... how could she be? shes never had a broken heart.... shes just like things will get better... your just overreacting... blah blah blah. how would she know? she doesnt know how my heart is breaking right now b cuz im scared to death of losing tom. who knows what'll happen... all i know is that i despise myself right now, and i wouldnt blame tom for despising me either, if he already doesnt."

"event","nice day for a first entry, huh? lol. i guess i just needed to do this so i could find some way of expressing my feelings so i wouldn't have to burdon tom all the time. im feelin kind of bad about that. but anyway....not ready to go to classes or work tomorrow... i'm getting sick of both already. im also feelin really depressed today, in case you couldn't tell. hopefully its from my meds... if not, then i have no clue why im so depressed. maybe its just one of those days where im missin my guy and nothin else seems to be goin right. that sounds good.  hopefully tomorrow will be a better day."

What did you do in 2010 that you'd never done before?</span></b></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri;"">This time I didn&rsquo;t do anything that I hadn&rsquo;t done before. Boring!<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b><br /> I didn&rsquo;t really have New Year&rsquo;s resolutions for 2010. Wait, maybe it was the same like last year. Spending more time with friends and travel more. I did spend more time with friends. I traveled but only to places I&rsquo;ve already been to.<br /> <br /> <b style="""">3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b><br /> Not anyone close to me but an old friend from high school gave birth to a baby boy like a month ago. <br /> <br /> <b style="""">4. Did anyone close to you die?</b><br /> Yes and I still think about it every day&hellip;One of my best friends and my grandma both passed away around the start of 2010.<br /> <br /> <b style="""">5. What countries did you visit?</b><br /> Germany (Berlin), Japan (Tokyo)<br /> <br /> <b style="""">6. What would you like to have in 2011 that you lacked in 2010?</b><br /> A life&hellip;no I&rsquo;m just kidding. I think I would like to have less pain. I&rsquo;m not in pain right now but I&rsquo;ve been to some pretty rough times the last 2 or 3 months. My Crohn&rsquo;s disease was acting up again and caused me a lot of pain. So I&rsquo;m hoping that it&rsquo;ll be on the down low in 2011&hellip;Shoo! Go back into remission stupid disease!<br /> <br /> <b style="""">7. What date from 2010 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b><br /> I hate to say this but the 2 dates that will always be etched upon my memory are dates connected to bad things. First off is 17<sup>th</sup> of January when one of my best friends suddenly passed away because of an embolism in her lung. Then on the 26<sup>th</sup> of February my grandma passed away because of cancer. <br /> <br /> There are some good things though. I&rsquo;ve been to Japan this year in September and fulfilled a childhood wish. I was finally able to visit the Tokyo Game Show while being there. Supercharged covered my travel expenses because it was kind of a working/vacation trip. Uhmmm and somewhere in November my mom and step dad finally got their own house (They&rsquo;ve been living in a little flat for over 4 years now) so that means I get my own room at my mom&rsquo;s place and I&rsquo;m going to live there from next week on.<br /> <br style="""" /> </span></p>  <p style=""margin: 0.1pt 0cm;"" class=""MsoNormal""><b style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri;"">8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</span></b></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri;"">Getting my &ldquo;propedeuse&rdquo; and passed my first year at HKU. Shooting a promo video for Puma with Supercharged and just Supercharged in particular.<br /> <br /> <b style="""">9. What was your biggest failure?</b><br /> Getting behind at school. Due to my trip to Japan I got behind in some classes and I still have to hand in some work. Also, I blame myself for not spending more time with Melissa (my friend who passed away) but I guess that&rsquo;s a normal thing to do when people lose someone close to them. So I&rsquo;m getting over that.<br /> <br /> <b style="""">10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b><br /> Yes, this was a bad year for me if we&rsquo;re talking disease-wise. My Crohn&rsquo;s disease started to act up and I was in a lot of pain. All of this resulting into me getting new medication, more tests and eventually: A stay in the hospital for almost a week. Things have settled down now and I hope it&rsquo;s not coming back for a while&hellip;because I&rsquo;m literally pretty sick of this.<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 11. What was the best thing you bought?</b><br /> I&rsquo;ve bought a lot of sneakers&hellip;.and by a lot I mean A LOT&hellip;I think I bought like 20 pair or something since my sneaker addiction went through the roof in 2010. Especially the last couple of months. As for the rest&hellip; I think my Japan trip covers that, although I didn&rsquo;t<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>have to pay for my ticket I still had to pay for my hostel and food. Tokyo was a good time!<br /> <br /> <b style="""">12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b><br /> My mom&rsquo;s, my best friend Valerie, my little sister<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 13. Whose behavior appalled and depressed you?</b><br /> My step dad, I love him! Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but sometimes he really grinds my gears and he said some hurtful things.<br /> <br /> <b style="""">14. Where did most of your money go?</b><br /> Japan and sneakers, definitely! <br /> <br /> <b style="""">15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b><br /> Tokyo, Berlin at the start of 2010, getting my &ldquo;propedeuse&rdquo;, living with my mom and her finally getting a new house.</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri;""><br /> <b style="""">16. What songs will always remind you of 2010?</b><br /> Kane &ndash; Rain Down On Me, this might sound stupid or something because I&rsquo;m not a big Kane fan but Melissa sometimes listened to them. When I play Rain Down On Me so many memories come back to me and since her death this song just really gets to me, I see all these memories of us and the time we spend together. 2010 mostly consisted about me thinking of her and playing this song so Rain Down On Me will always remind me of 2010.<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 17. Compared to this time last year, are you:</b><br /> i. Happier or sadder?<br /> <i style="""">Sadder, don&rsquo;t get me wrong! I am really happy at the moment but compared to this time last year I am sadder because I lost people that are close to me. That still hurts everyday.</i><br /> ii. Thinner or fatter?<br /> <i style="""">Fatter, but that&rsquo;ll change soon enough. </i><span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br /> iii. Richer or poorer?<br /> <i style="""">Richer, I&rsquo;m still not very rich but last year around this time I bought a lot of stuff and still had to get out of uhm..overdraw because of my iMac.</i></span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri;""><br /> <b style="""">18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</b><br /> Traveling<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</b><br /> Complaining, slacking<br /> <br /> <b style="""">20. How will you be spending Christmas?</b><br /> Christmas is over! But Christmas eve consisted out of eating dinner with my dad, sis, dad&rsquo;s girlfriend and her son and unwrapping presents. Christmas day consisted out of unwrapping presents with my step dad, stepbrothers, mom and sis and later my oldest stepbrother&rsquo;s girlfriend.<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 22. Did you fall in love in 2010?</b><br /> In love is a big word, I liked a guy, he liked me back, didn&rsquo;t work out. End of story. So no, didn&rsquo;t fall in love in 2010.<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 23. How many one-night stands?</b><br /> None, although I had a fun night after a party and dated the guy for a short period but it didn&rsquo;t work out. You could see that as some sort of one night stand&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t know.<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 24. What was your favorite TV program?</b><br /> Californication, X-files, Skins, House, Dexter, Misfits<br /><b style=""""><br /> 25.

What was the best book you read?</b><br /> I&rsquo;ve only read the Twilight saga this year so I think that pretty much answers the question.<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b><br /> Mac Miller, Nicki Minaj, Bloody Beetroots, Deadmau5 <br /> <b style=""""><br /> 28. What did you want and get?</b><br /> My &ldquo;propedeuse, a Blackberry, trip to Tokyo and visit Tokyo Game Show, room at my mom&rsquo;s house.<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 28. What did you want and not get?</b><br /> Be healthy all the time<br /> <br /> <b style="""">30. What was your favorite film of this year?</b><br /> Iron Man 2, Inception, Toy Story 3&hellip;there are too many.<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b><br /> I turned 22 and had a blast of a party like every year with all of my friends =).<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b><br /> People around me NOT dying&hellip;? Not having to deal with my Crohn&rsquo;s Disease, travel more<br /> <br /> <b style="""">33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2010?</b><br /> I have no idea how you call that&hellip;I always wear my sneakers and try to match the color. Girly but sporty aswell? IDEK&hellip;<br /> <br /> <b style="""">34. What kept you sane?</b><br /> My friends and family<br /> <b style=""""><br /> 35.

I love each and everyone of them!<br /> <br /> <b style="""">39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2010:</b><br /> Live everyday like it&rsquo;s your last and enjoy all the little things in life. Before you know your life is over! It&rsquo;s better to have a short life full of great things and experiences than a long live with less great things and no experiences&hellip;or something along the lines of that.</span></p>  <p style=""margin: 0.1pt 0cm;"" class=""MsoNormal""><b style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri;""><br /> 40.

"event","<p>And now I'm going to write something down here for real!&nbsp;Everytime I open this page and I can't get myself to write something down here. Because I&nbsp;don't really know what to write. Things are going better. For a long time I&nbsp;didn't feel like updating because of what happened at the start of the year. Still thinking about that every day ofcourse. But I kind of managed to give it a place and have some sort of peace with it.</p><p>On the other hand I've been busy with school, work, hanging around with my friends. Because if there's one thing I've learned since January is that you have to live everyday like it could be your last. Don't have regret and just have fun and make the best of it. So, this school year is almost over and I'm working really hard to get my P&nbsp;(propedeuse) because if I&nbsp;don't I&nbsp;can't continue school and they'll kick me out. That's art academy for you. Really strict. Because if I&nbsp;fail and they do kick me out I can never come back or follow another education at that faculty (Art, Media &amp;&nbsp;Technology).<br />But I'll manage!&nbsp;My End Year Assessment is in 2 weeks and then they're going to look at all the work I've done in the last year and see if I&nbsp;made any progress.&nbsp; </p><p>These 2 weeks are going to be really tough. Decided to create a music video for Eckhardt (a Dutch musician). From scratch, so concept, shooting and post production. Then I still have to fix my typography assignment and make some items for Supercharged.tv. We are finally online by the way at <a href=""http://www.supercharged.tv"">http://www.supercharged.tv</a>.&nbsp; </p><p>I guess that were the most important things in my life these past months. Haven't really been up to something. Lots of work and going out with friends. Which is good aswell &lt;3.</p><p>Wouldn't trade it for the world.</p>"

"event","<p>Fuck you 2010 for taking people away from me!&nbsp; It's been barely a month since Melis died and already I&nbsp;have to process another loss. Or better said...will have to process another loss, since she's still here. My grandma is dying of cancer and I spend half of the day there next to her deathbed...My grandma got diagnosed with cancer a couple of years ago but it didn't really do any harm to her. She had a tumor which was sort of a time bomb since it didn't do anything. Not growing, not spreading, nothing... Until 4 weeks ago when it suddenly went downhill really fast. </p><p>On the day of Melis her funeral I&nbsp;heard that my grandma was in the hospital with some sort of heart failure. Heart diseases run in her family and she already got operated once so it wasn't that strange. She went home 4 days later but still had pressure on her chest and fluid in her legs. After a while her belly swelled up because they detected fluid there aswell. She went for an MRI&nbsp;scan only to discover that the cancer spread to her whole body and that there was nothing they could do to save her. My grandma didn't really care since she told us that she was ready to leave this life to go to my grandpa (who's been dead since I&nbsp;was 4). So it got worse day by day and it didn't take really long till the doctors gave her morphine. Still she was walking and laughing and everything. She's so strong! </p><p>I got a call this morning that it wasn't going too well and that today was her last day. She was in so much pain so the doctor agreed to give her a morphine pump so she could go &quot;peacefully&quot; in her sleep. Got picked up by Erwin and said my goodbyes to grandma when she was still awake. She nodded and kissed me and not too long after that she fell asleep. She woke up once because of the pain so the doctor had to come back to give her another shot. Now she's getting morphine through a pump so we have to wait untill she gives in. But she doesn't... it's been a day now and she's still breathing and her heartrate is constant and normal. I stayed there till 3 pm today but it was so hard to see her...to hear her... gurgling because of the fluid in her lungs. Heartbreaking...nervewrecking. </p><p>Saw all of my uncles and aunts, cousins, my grandma's brothers and sisters, all said goodbye to her on her deathbed. My mom and her sisters are there right now, spending the night and waiting for her last breathe. Hope it all doesn't last very long...it's for the best.</p><p>&quot;And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself that I&rsquo;ve already taken too much today. <br />As each descending peak on the LCD took you a little farther away from me.&quot;</p><p>Away from me.....</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>Haven't had the time and will to post this yet but I&nbsp;want to let everyone know here...Also, this is a huge part of my life so I want this to have a place @&nbsp;my journal.</p><p>Last Sunday (17-01-10) one of my best friends suddenly passed away. Melissa Selina Meeuwsen, 23 years old and right at the start of her life. It makes me so angry to think of the way it happened. How it had to be... She had no clue, no way to prepare herself and she had so much to live for. So much to do and right at the start of a good career. She was always lively, bright, happy and cheering people up. Such a strong individual and I'm glad that I&nbsp;can say that she was my first and real best friend. Soul mates...2010 was the year that we knew each other for 10 years.....</p><p>She twisted her knee around Christmas, not really a bad sign or something because she had weak knees. Doctor said to give it some rest and to not put pressure on it. So she did but unfortunately she twisted the same knee again while in the shower. Again, more resting and no walking.&nbsp;And so she did. Until Thursday (14-01-10), she started having trouble breathing but since she just had a cold she tought it wasn't anything serious. On Friday it got much worse and she couldn't inhale deeply. They went to the doctor but he was really busy so he gave her some antibiotics. Her mom had Pneumonia so it was only natural that Melis could've gotten it aswell. Saturday she woke up with a sore ankle so her boyfriend massaged it. Didn't seem to weird because of her knee ofcourse. Her mom called for breakfast and she wanted to &quot;walk &quot;&nbsp;down the stairs when suddenly she didn't feel too well and sat down. She told Paul that she thought she was going to faint, not a second later she fell down the stairs. She came too and asked what happened and that she was thirsty but not too long after that s he passed out. Paul called 112 (Dutch 911) and they performed CPR for 2!!!!!&nbsp;hours and rushed her to the hospital. After 2 hours they got her heart beating again but she was still unconscious and kept in a comatose state. Her brains got all swollen because of the lack of oxygen for 2 hours and because of that most of her vital functions were failing. She had massive brain damage and after a while they stated that she was brain dead. Then around 3:30 Sunday morning her family said their goodbyes to her and they pulled the plug. I&nbsp;heard the news around this time (15:30) last Sunday.</p><p>I called her mom last Monday and went to Berlin with Supercharged.tv to film at Bread &amp;&nbsp;Butter. Returned home earlier for the funeral which was last Friday. The funeral was beautiful! They played RoST -&nbsp;Life Is Beautiful, a song that Melis loved and I&nbsp;knew that she wanted that song to play at her funeral. We decided that for both of us when we were younger. After the funeral I and a couple of friends and her boyfriend went to her house and we went to her room. Really awkward because she passed away so suddenly so it was as if she could walk into the room any moment. But we laughed, talked about good memories of her and how she would react to everything. When I&nbsp;got home I&nbsp;looked through all my backups from the last years and collected everything I&nbsp;could find from her. Drawings, designs, text documents etc. Especially drawings, she was such a good artist and her mom wants to collect all of her drawings and bundle them. Make a book out of it. Then yesterday evening I&nbsp;went to Paul (her boyfriend)&nbsp;and we talked about her. Filled each other in with information about her and talked about the times we were together and stuff. I&nbsp;also brought some of my old school agenda's because she wrote stuff in them =). Had an old holiday card of her and we listened to a tribute of 2 hours on the anime radio she used to listen to. A lot of people from the community could request songs and they played songs that were here favorites. Listening to that right now aswell. Such great people!&nbsp;They didn't even know her personally but all the things they had to do to get this arranged. There were 700 listeners online yesterday, a record. That proves how wonderful she was and she was easy to make friends with. Could make you feel like you knew her for years!&nbsp;</p><p>I&nbsp;could go on and on but I'm still having a hard time coping with everything. It's so fresh... and still so surreal and hard to believe. I&nbsp;have to confront myself everything with facts and stuff that I'm not able to tell or show her anymore. She helped me to become the person I&nbsp;am now...one of the most important persons in my life. I&nbsp;have a lot of memories of her, we shared a lot....hard to believe that I'm not able to do that anymore...we promised each other to get old together. Old people talking to each other with a cup of tea, reminiscence about the past. Luckily I&nbsp;have a lot of support from my friends and Paul is a big help to get me through everything because we were the people that were closest to her although I&nbsp;didn't see her so often as I&nbsp;used to because of school and work. Our bond never weakened, only got stronger. The times that I&nbsp;do get to spend with her were like old times, like nothing had changed at all....Forever!&nbsp;Never fading....</p><p><img src=""http://www.requiem.nl/Images/PR/1539/Thumbnails/foto.jpg"" alt="""" /></p><p>Melissa Selina Meeuwsen<br />26-09-1986 - 17-01-10<br />You've finally gotten your wings....Keep rising!<br />Rest in peace.....</p>"

"event","<p>2 months since my last entry. I think 2009 deserves another entry to recap everything I've done in the past year. So here it is:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. What did you do in 2009 that you'd never done before?</strong></p>Lots of things, visited New York and Berlin. Going to celebrate New Years out of the country, thus visit Paris. Started a HBO&nbsp;education etc.<br /><strong><br />2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</strong><br />I&nbsp;don't recall any new years resolutions that I&nbsp;had for 2009 but I&nbsp;remember making a statement to myself about traveling more. See places I&nbsp;want to see. As most of you know I&nbsp;did go to places I&nbsp;hadn't been before. I&nbsp;have some standard resolutions for next year but most of you will call me crazy if I'd mention them.<br /><br /><strong>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</strong><br />No not that I&nbsp;know of. Oh...I&nbsp;believe my cousin gave birth this year but she's not really that close anymore. <br /><br /><strong>4. Did anyone close to you die?</strong><br />No and I&nbsp;feel really lucky that I&nbsp;can say that.<br /><br /><strong>5. What countries did you visit?</strong><br />Amerika (New York), Germany (Berlin), Belgium (Antwerp) and going to visit France (Paris)&nbsp;in 2 days.<br /><br /><strong>6. What would you like to have in 2010 that you lacked in 2009?</strong><br />I would say free time...but that's only since I&nbsp;started school again last September. So that doesn't really count haha. <br />Also, I would like to finally have a boyfriend, as pathetic as that sounds...but it's true.<br /><br /><strong>7. What date from 2009 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</strong><br />First there was my awesome birthday party when I turned 21 this year on the 27th of March.<br /> Second is when I&nbsp;heard I&nbsp;got accepted at HKU (Hogeschool v/d Kunsten Utrecht) on the 30th of March. <br />Yeah, my life was kind of complete when I&nbsp;heard that =)!<br /><br />The most important thing was on the 18th of September. My mom got married to my (now official) stepdad =).<br /><p><strong>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</strong></p>Getting accepted at HKU!<br /><br /><strong>9. What was your biggest failure?</strong><br />I&nbsp;could've spend some more time with my friends the last couple of months but as a result of getting accepted I&nbsp;kind of let my friends down.<br /><br /><strong>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</strong><br />Yes, still suffering from my precious chronic disease called Crohn's disease. <br /><strong><br />11. What was the best thing you bought?</strong><br />My 21,5 inch Apple iMac and my very own PlayStation 3. I&nbsp;know!&nbsp;I&nbsp;already had one at my mom's but I&nbsp;had to share that one with my stepbrother.<br /><br /><strong>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</strong><br />My mom's and my stepdad. They both seem very very happy =)!<br /><strong><br />13. Whose behavior appalled and depressed you?</strong><br />Hmm, noone's really. Sometimes my dad and my sis but that happens from time to time.<br /><br /><strong>14. Where did most of your money go?</strong><br />New York trip definitely. My iMac costed a lot but my trip was around &euro;2750,-. 500 for the flight, 250,- for the rooms and 2000,- to spend. <br /><br /><strong>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</strong><br />My trips, Bread &amp;&nbsp;Butter Berlin, Supercharged, accepted by HKU, my mom's wedding, my tv shows, Robert Downey Jr ;)!, X-Files etc.<br /><br /><strong>16. What songs will always remind you of 2009?</strong><br />Robert Downey Jr songs, played them over and over again. X-files theme and lots of other songs and themes.<br /><strong><br />17.

If I'm not doing one of those things then I may be busy with Nunchaku practise or working on our Supercharged project. All in all I'm working constantly and I'm enjoying my (rare) free time to the fullest.</p><p>Right now I'm very busy with a couple of assignments I have to hand in in the week of October 12th. After that we'll start a new &quot;block&quot; with new lessons and new assignments.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the classes I have:<br />Dramatic principles<br />Camera<br />Photoshop &amp;&nbsp;Illustrator<br />Concept &amp; Visualization<br />Research &amp; Profile<br />History of Art<br />Drawing lessons<br />Design process<br /><br />Some are literally translated from Dutch to English because I don't know the English terms for those words. All in all it's very interesting, yes even the &quot;boring&quot; theory lessons. <br /><br />I guess that's everything that is happening in my life right now. Supercharged is going great but I&nbsp;can't share the info right now. Let's just say that we're busy with some great projects that will blow your mind!&nbsp;Site is scheduled to go online in late October so stay tuned for http://www.supercharged.tv! </p><p>As for Nunchaku, the green belt exam takes place mid November so I'm training really hard for that. Hope I'll receive my green belt so I can kick some serious ass!</p><p>I'm off to bed now! Work tomorrow from 9:00 till 5:00. After that it's schoolwork schoolwork schoolwork, so no actual weekend for me =(. It's worth it though. Need to get all the study points I can get this first block.</p><p>P.S:&nbsp;Didn't I&nbsp;tell you about those 5 days I&nbsp;freelanced for GUNK&nbsp;last June?&nbsp;The week after I&nbsp;got back from New York. I'm finally getting those gift certificates in the mail next week. Turns out I&nbsp;get a whoppin' &euro; 200,- for 5 days of work/fun/food etc. Was fun to do AND I'm also getting &quot;money&quot; for it. Now I'm a big step closer to buying myself a brand new shiny Apple iMac ;D!</p>"

Maybe I'm exaggerating a bit but actually it really is.</p><p>After a year of no school at all (okay, my LOI homestudy thing) I'll be starting an education again. If all goes well it's for 4 years. Last week was my introduction week which was awesome!&nbsp;Met a lot of interesting &amp; cool people and I'm really looking forward to our classes. <br />It's really weird to actually having to go to school again almost every day, following classes, making tests and stuff. I&nbsp;will have to pay attention in class again because this won't be so &quot;easy&quot; as my last school. Work hard and use every bit of free time for my assignments and studying.<br /><br />Supercharged is still standing strong by the way! We had to postpone our website because the scripting was harder than we thouh but it's going to be mindblowing in our opinions. I'll be having a meeting at the 9th of September to discuss everything and to look at the upcoming months. Already got ourselves some sort of sponsorship deal although our website isn't even online yet. Good things are coming our way but I can't talk about that yet since it's classified. It's going to be our breakthrough. <br /><br />When I was on vacation I started reading the Twilight saga btw. Awesome books! Really love them, don't worry though. I&nbsp;won't transform into a creepy Twi-hard fangirl. I'm reading Eclipse at the moment and I'm so in love with it. Can't wait for New Moon to come out, hope it's better than the first movie.</p><p>Guess that will be all!&nbsp;Can't wait for House and Californication to start again at the end of September. Also Nunchaku training starting tomorrow ;D!</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>What have I been up to the last couple of months?&nbsp;I feel like I'm finally getting a grip on the business where I want to work when I'm done studying. Lots of opportunities and new people as I&nbsp;said in one of my other logs. This time not with&nbsp;Sneakerbaas since that's history. I'm still working together with most of the old <strike>Sneakerbaas</strike> crew but we started a new project together with Blammo. Blammo was also involved in <strike>Sneakerbaas</strike> but Boris pulled back and invited some of us to join him and set up a new project. The project's called Supercharged! and if everything goed according to plan then we'll be online by the beginning of September. This new site also revolves around sneakers but it goes deeper than that.&nbsp;It's about the sneaker lifestyle which also involves things like fashion, music, gadgets, traveling, photography and events. The big main thing is ofcourse sneakers but we want to create a lifestyle website. On the website there are going to be video items about sneakers, clothing and events but in the end we're also going to make city guides in video style.</p><p>Imagine going to New York or Tokyo and you're searching for an online shopping guide and shops recommended by other sneakerheads. You draw your little map and start looking. No, not with Supercharged. We film everything, how to get there from trainstation to the front door of the shop. Maybe do an interview with the owner, what kind of sneakers they have etc! That's a long way from now but we want to do it as soon as our budget allows us to. </p><p>I&nbsp;already had one big trip to Bread &amp;&nbsp;Butter Berlin (Germany). This one was mostly sponsored by Blammo so&nbsp;it only cost me 7 euro's haha (including travel costs, hostel, food and press passes). We interviewed some people of big brands like Reebok, New Balance, Pro-Keds, Onitsuka Tiger etc. We also wanted to film @&nbsp;Nike's stand but they didn't do interviews. I&nbsp;also saw Jeremy&nbsp;Scott in real life (He's a famous designer for Adidas). So yeah we shot a lot of material and our first item is going to be online in September. </p><p>September is a big month this year because that's also the month that I start at HKU&nbsp;(Hogeschool voor de Kunsten Utrecht). I finally got accepted at Image and Media Technology so I'll be able to get my Bachelor ;D! Also, still freelancing for GUNK. Went to Antwerp a couple of days after I&nbsp;got back from New York to work on the tv set.&nbsp;They now have their own digital tv channel so I had to help with the montage and camera. </p><p>So that's my life at the moment. Busy but good!&nbsp;Lot of good times ahead!&nbsp;I'm going to make it in my life!&nbsp;I&nbsp;can feel it!&nbsp;I'm motivated, I&nbsp;know the right people and I've done the right work!&nbsp;Now my education is going to fit perfectly in all of this. Go me!</p>"

From my own god damn room and it makes me so fucking angry.</p><p>So, all was well and I was in for a nice evening full of movie-watching. The whole day I had been looking forward to re-watch Iron Man for the 4th time because I love that movie (and ofcourse Robert Downey Jr). So I open my DVD case only to discover that there's one disc missing. Ofcourse it's the fucking disc with the movie on it. So I'm getting fucking paranoid because I'm not a messy person. I&nbsp; absolutely hate misplacing things so I always, ALWAYS, put my dvd or game back in the case where it belongs. Never ever am I&nbsp;leaving a dvd or a game in my console or dvd player. So this has never happened to me before and I'm starting to doubt myself but I&nbsp;can't remember replacing a dvd or lending it to someone. </p><p>So I check my consoles, laptop and dvd player because maybe the disc was still in there but nope, they're all empty. Then I started to open every fucking dvd case and game cases. Nope no Iron Man dvd. But what do I find?&nbsp;WHAT DO I FIND?&nbsp;MY CALL OF DUTY 3 AND TIMESHIFT GAME DISCS ARE ALSO MISSING!!!! </p><p>So I freaked out and I&nbsp;checked every single case that's in my room, searched EVERYTHING but without a result. Called my dad if maybe he watched Iron Man or if he has any idea where my discs could be but he doesn't have a clue. I don't remember someone taking it or borrowing it but what I&nbsp;do know is the day I came back from New York there were these strange shady friends of my sis at our place at night. </p><p>But I was out of it. I was so extremely tired and jet laggy that I&nbsp;went to bed early but I&nbsp;woke up around 4 o clock. I&nbsp;heard noises in my room, people that I&nbsp;didn't know, I could hear my sis downstairs so I thought it was okay.&nbsp;I&nbsp;was too tired to check anyway and I went back to sleep. The next day I see that some of my dvd's are moved and some are lying on my table and I&nbsp;definitely didn't put them there. So I&nbsp;yell a bit at my&nbsp;sis for letting strange people into our house and in my room for god's sake. But now everything becomes clear because I&nbsp;definitely suspect them from stealing my shit! </p><p>NOW I CAN'T WATCH IRON MAN BECAUSE OF THOSE CRACK JUNKS BITCH ASS MOTHERFUCKERS!&nbsp;FUCK!&nbsp;It makes me so fucking angry!&nbsp;Especially because my sis is all like:&nbsp;Oh..really?&nbsp;Damn I'm so sorry...Won't do it again ok?&nbsp;Ok byeee!&nbsp;But I have to buy Iron Man again this monday. My fucking shit is stolen and noone cares. Fuck it!&nbsp;There's nothing I&nbsp;can do except buy myself new copies of the stuff that's been stolen. That's like 100,- worth of stuff....I don't have the money.</p><p>Damn it... I'm going to rant some more and try not to break any stuff. Fucking cunts.</p>"

The weather is good, life is good, got asked to edit a promo movie for a website from a friend of mine which I&nbsp;get paid for. Ofcourse my intake at HKU&nbsp;went well, school starts in&nbsp;September and I'm fucking psyched. Going to New York in only a month! I&nbsp;turned 21 last week and my party was one of the greatest parties in history. Yeah we celebrated good!&nbsp;</p><p>Then, last but not least, Sneakerbaas.com. (literally translated:&nbsp;sneakerboss.com). SB&nbsp;is a new website that's online since the beginning of 2009. It's a website mostly about sneakers but also the whole lifestyle around it.&nbsp;For example:&nbsp;New Era caps, denim/jeans, hoodies, watches, etc. They have a forum where you can discuss things and they have video items on a weekly basis. These items mostly consist out off reports about expo's and events but also store reports and sneakernews. </p><p>They placed an add on the website that they needed people so I replied. Got mail that I&nbsp;was invited @ the office for an interview because they desperately needed editors and camera people. So I went there today (it's in&nbsp;Amsterdam, at T' Ij) and had a little talk with 2 of the Sneakerbaas guys and with one of the, I&nbsp;believe, co...founders of Sneakerbaas, Boris. Maybe some of you know Boris from Gamekings. Well he's behind the scenes at Sneakerbaas aswell and we had a little talk about the tasks that I'm going to fulfill. The tiny Sneakerbaas office is the same office as Blammo TV&nbsp;(the company behind Gamekings) so a lot of people I&nbsp;know from Gamekings were there. Turns out that they know each other very well and that they're really close. All the dudes were really nice, inviting me over for BBQ and stuff but since I&nbsp;had to work from 6 till 9 I&nbsp;had to cancel. </p><p>Boris brought me to the station in his Mercedes convertible haha and tomorrow I'm going to Digs For Limp with the Sneakerbaas crew to shoot some B-Roll and to do some interviews with the traders/standholders/organisation. Then on Monday I have to be back in the office because I have to edit the video for Digs For Limp. </p><p>So yeah... the train starts rolling for me!&nbsp;New world, new contacts, lots of opportunities. Let's see where we strand!</p><p>(Oh yeah... English?&nbsp;Not so good...I seem to have lost my touch...)</p>"

"event","<p>Maybe you're all wondering how my intake went yesterday. Let me tell you, but first I need to explain how the intake procedure works.</p><p>I came in at 8:30 and I&nbsp;had to sign myself in so they could check if everyone was present. After that they directed me to the classroom where I could display my work on a little table. I set everything up and left for the cafeteria. There we had to wait till 12:45 and we gathered at the &quot;auditorium&quot;.</p><p>They had lists with names of the people that were invited for some sort of intake interview. If your name wasn't on the list then it was the end of the line for you and that meant that you didn't uhm.. advance to the next&nbsp;&quot;round&quot;. I applied for Audio Visual Media but it's possible that they invite you for more then 1 interview. If they think your suited for another &quot;direction&quot; than you applied for they will invite you for an interview for that specific study. Or if they think that you're material for both directions you just get 2 interviews, both for another study direction.</p><p>I have no idea if that's the right word: &quot;study direction&quot;. But I think it's pretty clear what I&nbsp;mean XD.</p><p>Anyway, as I&nbsp;said, I applied for Audio Visual Media but I got called for Image and Media Technology. Had to show them my work again and they asked me some questions. The interview was so they could get to know me and to see if I&nbsp;was good enough for their school basically. I think it all went okay.<br /><br />They'll notify me in 14 days by letter. So in 14 days I'll finally know if I'm accepted. The thing is...if I&nbsp;get accepted, it's for Image and Media Technology and not for Audio Visual Media. That's completely off the table since they didn't invite me for an AVM interview. IMT&nbsp;looks really cool and was sort of my third choice but I&nbsp;really don't know if I should take IMT instead of AVM. It's really hard to get accepted by HKU&nbsp;in the first place so maybe I'll just take it and do my best. Maybe I'll stop after a year and switch to AVM (it's much easier if you're already in) or just try IMT for a while so I can put it on my resume.</p><p>&nbsp;I&nbsp;know I&nbsp;sound like I&nbsp;don't want IMT&nbsp;but that's not true. It looks really awesome and I think IMT&nbsp;is going to be a real challenge. I'm looking forward to that but I'm just so scared that I'll become stuck in the middle of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yeah, I totally forgot to explain what IMT&nbsp;is since Audio Visual Media speaks kinda for itsself. IMT&nbsp;mostly is editing short movies like video clips, commercials or promo's. You add animations to them with After Effects like the promo's for MTV?&nbsp;Those weird little videos?&nbsp;That's what IMT&nbsp;people do. Or intro's for series and movies. Little commercials and special effects. AVM is just plain filming, editing, script, scenario and directing. IMT&nbsp;is all of that plus the special effects and little animation thingies.</p><p>I think I'll regret it so much if I&nbsp;decline my invitation (IF I am accepted in the first place). I think I'm going to take it....<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>I'm kinda at loss at the moment. There are some things that are bothering me and I&nbsp;don't really know how to fix them if it doesn't work out as planned. For one is my second application to HKU&nbsp;(Hogeschool van de Kunsten Utrecht) and to WDKA (Willem De Kooning Academie), both for Audiovisual Media HBO. I&nbsp;still have to re-apply for WDK but my intake for HKU is somewhere in&nbsp;March. I'll have to come up with good stuff now and I&nbsp;really have to build a portfolio since I don't really have much to show except for the GUNKtv episodes I've filmed and edited. The real problem is that my laptop isn't exactly suitable for video editing and I&nbsp;still don't have a mini Firewire that I&nbsp;can use.</p><p>LOI&nbsp;(homestudy)&nbsp;is going okayish. I'm on schedule but I&nbsp;have to re-do my storyboard which is a pain in the ass. I'm no good at drawing...well, not anymore. I&nbsp;used to be good at it but my &quot;skill&quot; vanished or something. I&nbsp;keep postponing it and although I'm not behind on my work it still bothers me that I&nbsp;can't finish chapter 2 because of a grade that I'm still missing.<br /><br />Then we have my fantastic chronic disease. I&nbsp;really should take new meds because I'm starting to get immune to the ones I&nbsp;have right now (that's what I think is the problem). But I'm going to New&nbsp;York in May and my meds are definitely going to cause some trouble when trying to get into America. You know, them being strict and serious and all. They'll have to check everything, want to see my medical passport etc. The thing is, if I&nbsp;tell the doctor I&nbsp;want new meds, then I'll get injections. I'll have to take some syringes with me and I'll have to ask the steward/stewardess to put them in the fridge during the flight because you have to cool them. <br /><br />And last but not least, my headache, that I&nbsp;almost have 3 days now. Non stop. I&nbsp;go to sleep with a headache and I&nbsp;wake up with my head throbbing like I&nbsp;have an enormous hangover. It feels like my brain is leaking out. </p><p><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

It all goes well =). Sometimes it is a bit hard to make myself pick up my books and start reading or keep myself to reading instead of doing other things online. But all in all it's all good. It's really annoying when you've read a chapter for the 21093029th time and it still doesn't stick so you don't know the answers on all of the questions.

More money though! </p><p>- Got myself a brand new shiny phone =D! A Nokia N95 8 GB version.

"event","<p>I&nbsp;have another problem which is my very own problem. Something I&nbsp;have to deal with myself.</p><p>I take Puri Nethol for my Crohn's disease. I&nbsp;have to take that on daily basis, one pill a day plus 2 pills a day for my blood. The last couple of days my stomache is starting to hurt again, like it did before my medicines. I'm trying to calm down by telling myself that it's just temporary and that it'll go away again. But maybe it's not going away, maybe I've grown immune to my medicine and my body needs more. Maybe my Crohn is having a relapse and is really agressive at the moment. That's the most fucked up thing about Crohn. You can live years without any pain and you can control the symptoms by&nbsp; keeping the disease in remission. Then it flares up only to go back into remission.</p><p>I spoke my specialist before about this and he told me that if my medicine stopped working or didn't work at all that I&nbsp;had to take another medicine called Humira. With Humira I&nbsp;have to inject myself every 2 weeks and then it'll be fine. But I&nbsp;don't want to inject myself. It's not some small little needle that'll give you a little pinch in your finger. No it's a big injection, the ones you get at the hospital or when they're going to take some blood samples.  I don't want to feel like a junk. Maybe I'm the one who's stubborn here but that's something I really DON'T WANT!</p><p>If I&nbsp;stop with my medication I have a 60%&nbsp;chance of getting infections and that sort of stuff. There is another option after Humira but that involves something even worse. I'll have to walk around 24 hours a day with an infusion. Or at least 6 - 8 hours a day. Nothing yay about that.</p><p>I'm really scared and angry right now because everything was going so great. I&nbsp;kind of forgot I&nbsp;had Crohn but now I remember the harsh truth.</p>"

"event","<p>Everything's fine, peacefull, I&nbsp;feel good, nothing to worry about. I'm sitting at the kitchen table at my mom's place since I decided to stay here till friday. My mom pokes my stepdad and asks him quietly if he already asked me &quot;it&quot;. I'm wondering what's it all about and why my stepdad should ask it, why not her?&nbsp;</p><p>He looks at me and asks me if I&nbsp;want to move in with them when they buy a new house. I don't know what to say and I'm just staring at him for about 20 seconds, then I&nbsp;answer slowly: &quot;I&nbsp;don't know...&quot;. It's not that I don't want to live with you but....I'll have to discuss it with my dad before I&nbsp;give an answer.</p><p>So that was my yesterday evening. I make it sound really dramatic but it kinda is for me. My parents never made me choose between them when they got divorced. I decided to stay with my dad because that was the best thing for both of them financially (or how you spell it). My mom's place is also too small for me to stay since Ronny and Randy both live there. I can only stay for the night when it's Ronny's week at his mom's. Ofcourse I can sleep on the couch but I don't have my own room. But Erwin's getting a new job at the end of this year and everything's going to change. They want to leave the little flat and buy a house and give me my own room.</p><p>Now I DO&nbsp;have to choose, I&nbsp;really want to live with my mom, often I'm home alone at my dad's because he's at his girlfriend's and stuff but he's trying so hard to make it work and he told me that he's glad we're staying with him. My sis also lives at his place and I'm 100 % certain she's not going to move in with my mom because she's very strict. My sis can do whatever she wants when my dad's not at home so I'm mostly there to keep an eye on her. </p><p>I&nbsp;know I shouldn't stay for her, my dad or anyone but I&nbsp;do feel responsible and I don't want to&nbsp; &quot;break up&quot; with my sis. My dad's gone very often so I already know now that I won't be able to visit him very much if I&nbsp;decide to live at my mom's. </p><p>They don't know yet when they'll be able to buy a new house. Could be in a couple of months, could be in a year but I have to make this choice now. It's so hard, both sides have pro's and con's but the hardest thing is letting people down. I have to make the choice for myself but I&nbsp;can't let down the people I love. That's just me...</p><p>In short words:&nbsp;It feels like the divorce is starting all over again...</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I'm also not in the mood for bulletpoints, I just want to type up a normal entry about what's going on in my life but there is nothing. My life consists of eat, sleep, work, X-files, Californication and talking to some people on MSN. I don't play games anymore, I don't go out to see friends, I&nbsp;don't work out. NOTHING. I'm planning to start with some sort of course in November for Audio -Visual Professional but my boss has me planned in for 32 hours a week at work. </p><p>I wish there were more hours in a day really. Or that I'm done with watching everything of X-files. But on the other side I don't want that at all. I've become so attached to that show that it'll be hard to live without it the first couple of weeks. That sounds really dramatic and geek-ish but so be it. See it like a soap opera you've always followed and suddenly it over. It stops. That sort of things leave a hole. Emptyness, at least for the first couple of weeks. Luckily I have other things so I can replace X-files. I&nbsp;just bought Fable II&nbsp;today but I&nbsp;haven't even played it yet, plus that I&nbsp;have like 10 episodes of other series to watch, going out with friends, etc. </p><p>I'm done now, I don't know anymore...</p><p>Hey wait, I&nbsp;wrote something here!&nbsp;Mission accomplished.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

We're going to ""cruise"" across The Netherlands and our last destination will be Friesland. Sneek to be precise. On the way there we're going to stop at Hardewijk and some other harbor villages. There are also a couple of big harbors with a lot to do and with a camping spot there so I hope I won't be bored. Some other things we're going to do are going to a theme park (Walibi World), shopping, cinema, going out for dinner and just going out at night. Luckily I have Randy and Miranda with me although they're 2 and 4 years younger than me. 

Oh my god, I haven't been speaking English in a long long time so it's really lacking right now. I have the feeling&nbsp; that everything is wrong about this entry. 

My dad is going to pick me up at the 18th, next Friday. The rest will stay on the boat and my dad is going to drop off a friend of Miranda. She will stay with them for another week and they return on the 26th of July. Then the 27th we all go to Schiphol Airport and Miranda will fly to France with her friend to go on a holiday with her parents and I will go to Japan of course =D! 

So I have one week left to do my things before I go to Japan on the 27th. Only 16 days away! Madness!  

Anyway, see you all in a week!"

I finally know what is causing my stomach problems and illness for over a year now.  <br /><br />I've been with diagnosed Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is a chronic, episodic, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is generally classified as an autoimmune disease.

I still want to learn more so I'm trying to get into a new school to really learn the aspect of film and tv making and everything around it. 

Going to Japan in 55 days. We finally found a good hostel where we can all stay. Going to be a great trip, 10 people, really good friends and I'll be in Japan again! I'm looking forward to seeing Ueno again and all the spots that I've been to last year. 

This was supposed to be a long entry about everything I've done up to this point but I don't know what to type down anymore. It's just chilling around the house fooling around and doing nothing. 

Oh I do got the job at Free Record Shop by the way! Last Saturday was my first workday and it was awesome. Have to work tomorrow from 9:30 till 1:30. After that I have to go to the hospital for my monthly wound checkup. Everything is fine with that by the way. Some little problems but all in all way better than the last time I got operated. Only some stomach problems now that I have to report *sigh*. I'm hoping that none of this will have effect on my Japan trip because I really don't want to think about canceling that.

"event","Still haven't heard much of that job but they told me they liked my profile and my application I send in so * crosses fingers* I'll keep waiting. 
In other news, Bart Smit recently asked a girl from another store to work there for the Friday evenings and apparently 1 April some guy is leaving there and I still don't hear something from them. They don't call, they haven't been asking how I've been, I think they just don't care. I really hope I'll get that other job but it's good to know that I can try if it doesn't work out and hope those bastards take me in again. I guess they will since they don't have any new employees yet&nbsp; but you never know. 

 I'm going to Barcelona with school at the end of the month like I told you but I was wondering if you have any ideas on what I should visit. Any sightseeing things and tourist spots? Stores I should check out? Sick sneaker shops? Anything. We have free time every day around 4. Maybe even some whole days. I kinda forgot what Barcelona has to offer although I've been there 5 years ago. We're going to look&nbsp; at some architecture with school as well but just tell me what I should visit and stuff =). 

We're going to book Japan next week! We're flying with Finnair for 913,- euro. From the 24th of July till 27th of August. I forgot if I already told you in my previous post. I can't wait! 

Exams are going well =), 10 days left before I'll turn 20! , that's it!"

"event","I'm anxious because I might have found a new job. I won't tell where yet because I do believe in jinxes and stuff. Believe me, it happened to me a LOT.&nbsp; I really want this job. I send out my application today and I think they will call for a job interview next week. A friend of mine works there and he told me they really need to hire some new employees since there are some people leaving and he's putting in a good word for me. Also they have a team meeting next Tuesday and they told him they really need to hire a female employee and my profile fits the work perfectly. <br /><br />Exams are going fine! I think everything is going according to plan and I don't think it's going to be a big issue. I'm looking forward to the trip to Barcelona at the end of this month. That's also when I turn 20 =), AND when we're going to book our trip to Japan! Because that's happening in the last week of March =D! We're flying with Finnair from Dusseldorf to Helsinki and then to Narita Airport in Tokyo. I can't wait! I'm so looking forward to it! Everything from last year is coming back to me! &lt;3 Nihon!<br /><br />I received My Beautiful Katamari and LOST: Via Domus (Lost: The game) this week and next week I'm receiving Lost Oddyssey. I love my work and the connections that I have now haha XD I can get most games for free. I did buy one today though, The Orange Box. I played it last week at Boy's and it looked awesome. <br /><br />Hmmm last thing that's maybe interesting is that I'm buying a new pair of Nike Dunks. Finally! I'm going to buy the Year of the Pig edition =D! They're pretty limited.

"event","Here an update about life again since I've been slacking with my journal a bit. 

It hasn't been that easy the last couple of weeks after the operation took place. I was stuck at home for about 3 weeks. Not that it wasn't pleasant to be home again because it really was in fact. It felt good to be at home again for longer than 3 days. Ofcourse I stayed at home for 2 weeks before because of the pain but this was different since I couldn't leave the house at all. After the operation I felt really weak the first 3 days so I couldn't go to Den Haag aswell to celebrate New Year's Eve with my friends. I was at my mom's, which was fun but kind of disappointing when I&nbsp; was so...anxious to go to Den Haag. Furthermore I couldn't do anything AT all. My mom or dad had to help me dress and undress myself, help me showering, putting my socks and shoes on, got the things for me if I needed something because standing and walking was also painfull the first days.

The next couple of days I spend on the couch watching tv or lying in bed. Sometimes I got online but I couldn't really sit so I never stayed online longer than an hour at the time. I felt so useless and lazy because I couldn't do something. I couldn't even exercise. After I discovered I could sit again I still couldn't go out of the house because I had to clean the wound at least 3 times a day and after each toilet break. It was a long time before I could actually do something or go out of the house. It felt so good to be outside again after 2 weeks. 

I returned to Belgium again and started to work since last week. It's going okay but I still need to take breaks from work because I can't sit that long. Sometimes it hurts because the wound is closing up but it's all ok. I still clean it everyday and I had to go to the hospital 2 times for a wound check up. It's all fine. 

2 weeks left here and then I'm back home again. I'm really looking forward to that but I know that I'll miss this place, or better said, my work. I heard that I can still work for them when I'm back home. They'll still call me to review or preview things or if there's a press trip available. I'll be paid aswell =)! My exams are closing in now and I really hope it'll be fine. I'm kind of nervous because I have the feeling that I'm not ready yet. I still have to learn so much. I hope I'll manage. 

So much for my rambling! By the way, we're already planning for Japan this year! I can't wait!"

"event","Back from the hospital and the operation went okay. As I told you, the wound is still open so every once in a while I need to clean it under the shower and refresh my ""band aid"" and stuff. It hurts a bit so I have to take 2 painkillers every 4 hours and I need to sit on a rubber band/tube....

I can't really be alone in the house since I can't really kneel down or pick things up from the ground, they have to dress en undress me (can't put on my socks and pants) and more of that stuff. Also I'm dizzy sometimes or feel kinda nauciaus (forgot to spell it). 

Had to be in the hospital at 11, got operated at 3:30 was done at 4:00 but I had to wait until I could feel my legs again and could walk. Was home at 10. Felt all fucked up....

But it's a bit better now. Have to come back at friday for a wound check up. 

Couldn't be in Den Haag with new years eve so celebrated at mom's. Was okay and fun, love my mom ofcourse but yeah.
It really sucked I couldn't be in Den Haag =(... would love to be there....but I'm stuck at home for at least a week...and I think even longer..."

Went to see Steve today and we talked and had a general laugh, which rocked my socks. Im happy to say i think we are pretty much cool. I just now want to get to see Nic and Jul soon as I havent been out with them in what seems like yonks.

Figured that my swimming and healthy eating would minimise the effects of hangovers etc. Tested that theory out last night by consuming horrid amounts of Bacardi Black and proved my thesis to be crap.
oh well.

Although I'm kinda ""in the ongoing process"" of coming out, having told everyone I consider a real mate, (and there's the obvious few who I have no interest in telling), it kinda got to me that it actually won't make anything better. 

No matter how many people I actually tell and even if they are cool with it, I'm quoting the show when I say

there may be loads of folk who love you to bits but not as many as there are who hate you for what/ who you are.

Obviously its just a show, but its hit the nail right on the head for me. 

I dont know if this is the time to be thinking bout this shit as i know im just gonna mull it over in my sleep but its really made a point in my head... and sent me on a bit of a downer basically.

this whole thing is crap. its not like i chose to be gay. if i could choose anything itd be to have 2.4 children, the wife, the easy life (in my eyes), and just not have to deal with all the asshole bigotry.

Watched a vid b4 bed tonight. ""Faster Pussycat, Kill!, Kill!"". Work of fucking art so it is.

Sent me back a bit remembering the Spice Girls and that Say You'll Be There video. remember it? I used to adore it! Trixie Firecracker rocks my world...

Guess I'm pretty worried about this handin and exam next week. But I'm taking the perspective that it will be such a major relief come friday next week. I bloody well hope so!

I hear tonight that Mags has opted out of goin to see Nicole and Emma in Paris due to lack of funds. That's really shitty, as I think she was fairly looking forward to it.
Nicky and Julie are thinking of having a Paris stylee party to cheer her up a bit which is well sweet. Hoping I can make it with all this shit I have to do. 

Also hope that in light of all the drama that has gone on recently in that flat, that Mags realises how spot on Nic is. I mean, she may not be best buds with Nicole, but she obviously still feels for Mags not getting to go meet her in France, hence the party. Hopefully they are on the wavelength that Nicky is a cool flatmate and friend, and not just Nicole's sparring partner. I'm sure they do and I'm just flapping as it's so late.... and also I know Mags totally has her feet on the ground and her head is sound and I'm giving her less credit than she deserves...ok now i'm rambling..!

I have no cd's that i even like. I've searched through everything and my music sucks. SIGH!!!

I need to get me some more cd's. There's some stuff in my collection which i dont even remember liking??!!

Have resorted to tiger tim for salvation. maybe he will play something good. no. just some madonna dire cover.

Anyhoo. Studied like a bastard today and yesterday but still feel like i aint gettin anywhere but will keep at it. 

What else has been happening? Oh, Mum's party went well, she really enjoyed it and loved the big busty beth cake too. phew!
Seeing as it was loads of oldies, me, brian, and alex just settled in a corner and doused ourselves in bacardi and buds. yum.

needless to say got horrifically drunk and headed down to brians afterwards (was staying there as we had family staying at ours and i got turfed out. nice.) in order to consume some more. garry had some chick-a-dees in and i proceeded to talk away to them even tho i didnt know them, about some girl who brian likes, explaining in great detail how she is a fanny. To my knowledge i only used the word Ho between 200 and 300 times. oops!

he found it funny but i was pretty embarrassed the next day.... oopsie

the next day. oh.

safeway is a killer with a hangover. sob. 1130 to 2030. not good. survived it and decided to go to bed instead of out or studying. good move.

sunday
just chilled in bed then back to safeway for another slog. wasted day really although sharon and i got out Glitter... the Mariah Carey film. Very funny, only for her looks of ""Hmm. im thinking really deeply"" and ""hmm. I feel traumatised"". not to mention the countless array of i love me mariahtronics in the countless songs. We did however invest in a big bag of lightly salted doritos, touch of lime doritos, a bottle of thousand island dressing, and a big boat-ul o irn bru. mmm. i'm a pie. but such a full, happy, contented pie. yum. Sharon is totally the best sister i could ever wish for. its kinda weird but we are so on the same wavelength its scary! i love how we get on so well. i just love her to bits.

anyway.. odd film. not to be revisited i fear.

monday just worked and today kinda the same. 

I wish i had something interesting to do other than this uni pish..i mean really. its only a week to go but it doesnt make it any more fun!!

i think thats all for now. im away to destroy my scooch cd and find something loud sure to annoy ma maw...

ciao for now

p.s. RE: MOOD  - im not feeling particularly artistic today, i just wondered what an artistic cat looks like...."

"event","Hey Ho,

just sittin chillin tonight after rushing about like a madman today. Sorted out all the gifts and stuff for my mums 50th and the party organized, the cake iced, art school stuff in full swing, and time for sleep. zzz

its been hectic as fuck trying to make sure that everything has gone well but worth it as my mum had an excellent day and seemed well chuffed with everything, heres hoping tomorrow night goes as well.

only a fortnight till handin and exam now so am feelin pretty nervous, and lookin forward to gettin past it too...

otherwise, i cant think that anything exciting has been happening. 

i feel in a funny mood today. nothing particularly bad has happened but i totally have that feeling that i just want to sit and greet. i feel like a total fanny, but its just weird. i dont know if any of u ever feel like that. there's really nothing to cry about, but i just would for the sake of it. am i going mental? am i getting a period?

jeez, what a bloody freeek!

anyways i'm listnin to slow music so maybe thats it??!!

i think im gonna take my scary little head to bed now and have a good snooze.

catch u soon

"event","Hey Ho,

Been pretty busy last few days. On Sunday, was busy feelin sick, Monday, went to see off Steve which was pretty hard. It seems like I'm having to say bye to him like every other month. But I guess its cool cos he'll be back up in September for good, well term time anyways. But really enjoyed seeing him, waved as bus pulled out like an old granny, but that's me eh?! Should've gotten a hankie to wave and ran after the bus like a 50's movie! He'd have fucking choked!!

Met up with Nic and Julie afterwards and went for a coke... yup. no alcohol!

Went up to the Art School for a bit only to find that I couldn't get in cos the bloody Janitor didnt have the sodding keys. hmph.

Went out bowling with Brian, Alex, Ross and Steven, which rocked as i haven't done that for yonks. Got my ass whupped in some of the games but astounded myself with my talents in fixing the scores..... ever the creative one...

Tuesday - Worked on art school stuff most of today then went to get my Mums birthday cake for her 50th party on friday night. its quite nice but i plan to maxwellize it b4 friday to make it better.... hmm.

today, however is pretty boring, am just typin away waiting to start work at 4.30 sob. So really nothing has happened to call exciting.. maybe as the weekend nears......

"event","Hey Ho,

Just recovering at present from the party last night. Twas Julie and My Birthday do, and I reckon it was enjoyed by all on the whole. Some of the costumes were quality!
I went as Kelly Osbourne and my sis as Ozzy. Julie looked fantastic as Annie Lennox, I think that was the first time I've seen her all done up in make-up, and she looked excellent, think she liked the rocksteady knuckledusters which was also cool..

As for Shakira (Nicky) she was totally unrecognisable as Nicky and looked well cool! What else did we have.. a Wes (L. Bizkit), a Fred Durst, Britney, Gareth and Will, A stunning Sophie Ellis Bextor, Gwen Stefani, Neil Primrose, RHCP, - the list goes on!

Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed it, but the aftermath is still burning... A whole lot of alcohol which had been given as gifts and stuff had been taken from the fridge by randoms and drunk which totally sucks. I mean, it's so shit to turn up at someones flat and help yourself. whats that all about?

Sharon doesn't seem best pleased with me either today. Got home and she never really spoke to me at all, and is now away back to Edinburgh. I think I may have told her some stuff she wasn't prepared to hear last night and maybe i should let her sit on it for a while before i call her...

Nevertheless, a top night, and still nursing a swollen head.... doh.

The best thing though was gettin to see Steve. Felt like I haven't seen him for a year. It was just sooo good to get a hug and just see him face to face. I know he is back in like 2 weeks but I've really missed him bad. Sob!

Gonna head for now and just chill. Think Brain is gon call me later to head out, may give it a miss. am totally knackered.

cheerio for now

"event","Jeez. Told you friday nights caused excitement!

After waiting god knows how long I finally came out to my best mate. Talk bout amateur dramatics...

Went out with Brian (best mate) and my mate Alex- went to the Shack (""high quality"" pub in Hamilton) and had a few.
Having told Brian previously that I had wanted to talk to him but didn't have the guts to say what I wanted to, the hype was up to factor 10, I was shittin it , and he was worried. Equipped with dutch courage two hours later, i just told him. Wasn't nice, I was well annoyed with myself for not having told him sooner. He was the best and I'm well relieved that we are still cool.

I totally hate this having to tell everyone, but has to be done... and if there's anyone who deserves to know, it's him. 
Glad to know that I can consider him a true best mate. The boy's a star.

Big up Lucy byraway for the fantastic code. She will get many ""special kisses""...

Signing off.

p.s. The Northern Lad is back for the weekend. *cheers!!!*"

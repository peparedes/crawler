school, select was fun altos kicked sopranos butts - minus jackey jill and kim kim -
because they cant sing with soul.  im not saying i sing amazing,  but i mean how hard is it to add some umph. i suppose its an alto thing right tay?

So then I get home and talk to tom on the phone for a while, while talking to tim , brandon , johnny and sometimes tay. lol

i want to be at kimmys now because thats where everyone is tonight. - o well-

tomorrow i have to sit through all day of sound. yay, and apperently no one likes the play so it will be fun....

Last night I had this dream it was so weird.  Well I had two .  One was wit Tay and Jill and Harry- whom i have never seen so it was a huge made up man harry. lol thats all i really remember.  The other was with Colin and Kimmy whispering something and pointing at Libby, then I went to see what was going on and they said Libby had magic powers.  It was funny because then Libby started to make people she didnt like float around school .  And Colin was saying something realy funny but I dont remember,  and i dont really know why they were in my dream,  she never talks to me i suppose because im her brothers girl friend, i understand i guess.  and kimmy and colin dont any more either * tear*  atleast not as much. i suppose there busy and all. Im going to miss them even libby next year even though she doesnt like me all the much

Then ofcourse Lauren and I had a wonderful spanish class talking about sopranos baddness and certain people we dont like. Wednesday trip to who knows where is sounding alot better than school .

So my mother came home today, she came home and said hi to tom and went to bed, thats really the most ive seen of her.  and She told me after tom left that shes leaving soon and moving to new york with or without me
Me = 15 yr old girl raising brother and providing for herself
Her= unresponsable parent who has a love life....

GRRRRR

PAI  i need a tape.....   im going to use a district solo i think,  its better than the crap Hunter found in a book.

<P><FONT color=#ff6666>Then we went to kimmys,&nbsp; where me and manda and kim were talking of things like how unmanagable nick oschman is,&nbsp;&nbsp;me and manda were so messed up it was hilarious.&nbsp; The mixture of the lateness, and the glue fumes THAT WE KNOW WERE THERE~!!!!&nbsp; got us so crazy.&nbsp; Then Kyle showed up , and later Johnny.&nbsp; I wish I could have gone to Pams with them,&nbsp; but I knew my mom was staying up for me and it was already getting close to twelve.&nbsp; Thomas was tired the entire night and just roamed around kims.&nbsp;It must be a guy thing * shrug*</FONT></P>

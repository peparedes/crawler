"event","So I finally have my ski trip all planned out...yay!  Me and the girls will be heading to the mountains and such over spring break and I am too excited!  Now all I have to do is finish all the stuff due before and after the trip...uggg  Anyways it should be an awesome one.

I am redoing my website...I currently hate what I have up so far and it certainly needs a massive amount of work.  But what can I say?  So thats another thing added to my very long to do list.  

My baby niece, poor girl, was dropped at the day care and broke her teeth :(  She is so sweet and my poor sister is going crazy!  Apparently they were changing her diaper when she fell off the changing table!  Luckily she will get her new teeth in and nothing else was damaged.  My sweet angel!  She is getting so big and walking now.  Its amazing to me how fast that happens!  

Well thats pretty much my updates...not very poetic but I am exhausted and am finding a hard time making time for me as it is...so thats all you get for now :D"

"event","So this month is only just starting and I feel the rush of things to do already piling up on my shoulders...despite this, I feel the need to keep my ""live journal"" somewhat up to date.  I recently watched the movie Bucket List, which was hilarious by the way, and I was inspired (once again) to write a list of things I want to accomplish before I kick the bucket.  I did the same thing after watching A Walk to Remember, another great chick flick.  So here are some of the random stuff I have come up with...

Take a road trip that lasts at least one week
Create a Musical CD featuring myself and others
Get a German Shepard and name it Max
Get my own place and have an art studio
Take my brother out with me and spend the whole day getting to know him
Save somebodies life
Ski Trip

any ideas?  Let me know!"

"event","<lj-template name=""qotd"" id=""292"" />Well I have many favorite artists.  There are many different catagories to the word artist so choosing between those is difficult.  Right now my favorite ""artist"" would have to be <a href=""http://www.mmassaro.com/"">Mike Massaro</a>, a personal friend of mine.  And despite his assumption, he is not my favorite simply because I hold a bias.  When I first met Mike I thought his art was awful and I couldn't understand any of it (it was hard to digest compared to the usual sweet art you find at the local Walmarts).  Then I realized I was so closeminded.  At first glance it was almost vulgar to me, however the more I learn about him and about art the more I understand the beauty in his pieces.  You can check out some of his stuff on his website <a href=""http://www.mmassaro.com/"">www.mmassaro.com</a> but keep in mind that the pictures he has posted are not always exactly what the piece looks like.  In my opinion they look better up close!"

"event","Today has been hectic, but somehow those are the best days.  I feel as though I have accomplished more, in some way, despite the long list of things I need to get done; clean my car, re-do my website, work stuff, lodge stuff...etc., etc.  The list is long and school starts on Tuesday!  Ahhhh!"

"event","As usual I am posting my top 5 New Years Resolutions...they are as follows, not necissarily in order of priority...
1. Learn to speak spanish fluently
2. get in shape and stay healthy
3. Read
4. Get straight A's and maybe one B
5. Start using the items I have neglected (Bike, shoes, clothes, hats, purses, makeup, jewelry...etc.)

So its fine to have a list but the next step is following the plan to achieve the goals...
1. I plan to read and speak spanish with anyone I know understands and I plan to make and use my grammar flashcards
2. Measure my food, drink lots of water and less soda, excersise at the gym twice a week and ride my bike at least once a week, be more active...
3. Here is my book list:
     Great Woman Initiates
     Empowering Children
     Reading Lolita in Tehran (never finished it)
     Rosicrucian History and Mysteries
   Well actually all the AMORC books are on my list to read...
     National Geographic (all the ones I already have)
     The life of Gandhi
   And so on...
4. I really need to focus and not procrastinate this semester
5. Is just doing it"

"event","So my travels were great!  I went to Argentina to visit my family on my mom's side...It was amazingly beautiful in the country, usually I go to the City.  One thing I love about visiting my family is it always feels like I'm traveling to a whole new world.  Argentina, although a very poor third world country, is full of life, excitment and adventures.  The people have so little and yet they can be so happy, and so willing to give you the shirt off their backs and the shoes off their feet!  I love my family and slowly managing to put the pieces together of my mother's mysterious history.  
     Then I also went to New York with the Twins and of course my parents, when we came back from Argentina.  It was basically four days of shopping.  Good times and money spent!  They seem to have the best deli sandwiches and pickles in New York...Love!  
     The only problem with the travels was coming back only to go back to work and get sick...the flu!  Now I am losing my voice and coughing up nastyness...
     Anyways I will post up some pics of my trips when I gain some more energy!  On another note.  I managed to convince my parents to set up a station at Mastercut (where I work) for making Valentines for the troops!  Who doesn't love men in uniforms?  So if anyone reads my journals and is interested we are sending them through www.give2thetroops.org which is a non-prof. org. I found off the US Military site!"

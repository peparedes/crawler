Jeeze...I can't stand her...I met my other aunt for the first time...My uncels wife...Aurora. (Sp??? Like Sleeping Beauty...)She is SO nice, I love her to death. She is great. I saw my cousin Jeffery....he's gettin big...and Tatianna...annoying...but hey...she is 6....It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be...would have been great if Cindi wasn't here.

-Giggles- My Ex boy had a go at that chic. Funny...

I am the luckiest girl in the world...I have Yami!

I haven't been this happy in a long time...I love you all (almost all o.o)


I woke up to this this morning :
"" I love you..more than anything in this world..more than my life...and I'd do anything for you..anything at all...anything you want....and..even if you decide you don't love me one day..I'd still be there for you..whenever you need me and for whatever reason...and if you ever decide you love me again...I'd gladly take you back because you're the only one I will ever truely love..the only one I will ever want the way I do...the only one I want to be with forever...""


along with more of it......but that is what I am posting....I cried.....happy tears of course....I'm so lucky...I love Yami....

Went to the arch. -Nods- I wanted to sit on the Buffalo. o.o;;;  But I couldn't.

Ima go with Willie to get his tattoo! (Willie is Wilus, or Willis or Wilis....everyone spells it differently) That will be Fuuuuuuun. 

Wow, umm, Ima go read my book...the new Harry Potter! ^_~


I love you...and you...and you...and me....
You rock, I rock...umm, not sure about you...-giggles- Okay, I need to calm down.

I pulled the car to a stop on the old dirt road, shuting off the engine and sitting there for a moment. I stared at the sight in front of me, taking it in. It has been a long time. Opening the door I step out of the car, my eyes searching the ground before it. After a moment, I see it. A faint reminence of a trail that used to be. I begin my journy on it, my tired and worn body wandering the slim path. My eyes travel the sites in front of me, taking me back to remember him. I remember that first day I saw him sleeping in my hide away.  I watched him sleep and fell in love with his breathing. He woke after hours, and I had no choice but to love the rest of him as well.  Every day I would rush to meet him here, and every day found him asleep. Every day I would watch him and fall in love with his breathing, and every day he would wake, and I would fall in love with the rest of him. I remember all of this as I step into my clearing, our clearing.  I also remember the day he went away, dressed so handsome in his uniform. He promised to meet me here again, when he returned, and take me away. It's been so long..I waited and grew old. It's time for him to come now, I know it is. I lay down in the grass, where I would always find him, letting my eyes close as I wait. I hear his breathing and know he is there. My eyes open and there he is, so handsome in his uniform. He takes my hand and we fade away...I'm with my love at last..."

P.C. (Mike) Took P.N and I to the zooooooo. I love the Zoo. ^_^ Aaaaaaall the pretty animals. By the time we left I had about 65498798 million -Uses P.C's exact number- animals I wanted to take home...and Jenna had lots of guys she wanted to take home....we were just gonna shove them in Mike's car and be off with them! Ooooh, and we saw the pengywins! They splashed me. o.o; 

OOh, and the mean guy said that speaking jibberish (Watch slums of beverly hills) wasn't a talent....plah! OOOH, and Dave was there...and we got free Zoo Buddy pins again....

We had to leave early though, cause I wasn't feeling good.....I don't do well in heat....it makes me sick....and it wasn't even that hot....-is pathetic...knows this-.....I'm soooooo sorry P.N and P.C

Hmm...I offended someone with one of my entries....and you know what? Good...that person called me every name in the book and was extremly mean to me.....all because I was on Jenna's side for something.....she didn't even know who I was...-shrugs- SO, I don't give a damn. 

I want Yami....but nuuuuuuuuuuu, he is still in school...-grummbles- STUPID school. I thought that maybe Yami had Shallow Hal syndrom...but...he can't...cause that would mean I had inner beauty...and I don't....so...its gotta be something else that allows him to see me as pretty when I'm not....-thinks-"

Go ahead and post and try to change my opinoin on things...but, it doesn't mean it will work...I put what I have learned through my life...and if I learn different...and not just through someone elses opinion..I will be more than happy to change the way I think...as most of you would..and again...I apologize to the very very very very few girls who have shown me that they arn't like the rest. I still prefer guys, that is me. Yeah yeah, I know that guys do the same shit and all that stuff...but..out of who I've shown loyalty to, the are the ones to return it...and..no...I don't have to explain myself to anyone but Yami(and he feels almost the same as me..though...his is more to do with dumping the lot of them into a big grave....he has the few that prove diff just like I do..)...and maybe Puppy...

STUPID girls that keep me away from my friends, girls that get to put thier hands all over MY guy, girls who purposly act stupid (Which, doesn't show your smart in whatever reason you are doing it..it just shows you are a lot more stupid than you think. Intelligence is much better than stupidity when it comes to most things..) etc! I hate them all, they are horrid! They say there are some guys...who are straight....and then ""turn"" gay...well, you wanna know why? BECAUSE they realize that girls are bitches and don't deserve the time of day. They realize guys are better. The gay guys who have known they were gay for forever...were just lucky enough to know it earlier. -Waits for all her gay friends to yell at her...but..doesn't care at the moment- Girls are evil. All they do is worry about thier clothes and makeup, bitch at each other, steal each others guys, stab each other in the back...and then act as though they did nothing wrong....its like...they have no morals anymore...and...I know guys can do the same thing...but no where near as bad as girls...I almost wish I wasn't one because I hate them so much...I could have Yami either way, so it wouldn't matter.  Maybe there was a time when girls wern't like this...but it sure to hell was bred out of them...I'm not saying girls should be all perfectly sweet and innocent and stuff, but come on...show a little dignity, and respect for yourself.

Lyrics to current songs..

Pretending - HIM

love is a flame that can't be tamed
and though we are its willing prey, my darling 
we are not the ones to blame


the more we have the more we want 
and the more it hurts our hearts, my darling
we are not the ones to blame
trust is a word all lovers know
the glorious art of staining souls, my baby
it always ends up in tears


so keep on pretending
our heaven is worth the waiting
keep on pretending it's alright
so keep on pretending
it will be the end of our craving 
keep on pretending

it's alright


when doubts arise the game begins
the one we will never win, my baby
it always ends up in tears...


Poison Girl - HIM

I did it all just for her
I did it all just for her
And love's heart is death
For me and my poison girl
A prey she was for the cruelty of love 
While its serpent inside crawled straight towards her heart 
The coldest kiss love ceased to exist
While we grew apart like never before
I did it all just for her
I did it all just for her
And love wants us dead
Just me and my poison girl
I did it all just for her
I did it all just for her
And love's heart is death
For me and my poison girl
the fire in her eyes 
grew dim and then died 
as the poison inside 
reached her heart 
And the coldest kiss 
faith ceased to exist 
as we grew apart 
like never before 
I did it all just for her
I did it all just for her
And love wants us dead
Just me and my poison girl
I did it all just for her
I did it all just for her
And love's heart is death
For me and my poison girl And the taste of the poison on her lips is of a tomb
I did it all just for her
I did it all just for her
And love wants us dead
Just me and my poison girl
I did it all just for her
I did it all just for her
And love's heart is death
For me and my poison girl
Poison girl 
And love's heart is death
For me and my poison girl
In this poison world

Join Me In Death - HIM
 
Baby join me in death
Baby join me in death
Baby join me in death
We are so young
our lives have just begun
but already we're considering
escape from this world
and we've waited for so long 
for this moment to come
was so anxious to be together
together in death
Won't you die tonight for love
Baby join me in death
Won't you die
Baby join me in death
Won't you die tonight for love 
Baby join me in death
This world is a cruel place 
and we're here only to lose
so before live tears us apart let 
death bless me with you
Won't you die tonight for love
Baby join me in death
Won't you die
Baby join me in death
Won't you die tonight for love 
Baby join me in death
this live ain't worth living
this live ain't worth living
this live ain't worth living
this live ain't worth living
Won't you die tonight for love
Baby join me in death
Won't you die
Baby join me in death
Won't you die tonight for love 
Baby join me in death
Baby join me in death

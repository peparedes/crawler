"event","After calming down...I went to see the incredibles with my father...he gave me some good advise...he is wiser than I once thought...I thought about it...and looking back on the day I cant believe how I acted...I cant believe what I did...its like I was some mischevious kid.  I feel awful for making her feel the way she did...I could see the pain on her face, I cant beleive I made her feel that way...I will never do it agian...I swear...that is not how I treat someone I love and I will feel bad for a long time.  I was overcome with something...but that is not an excuse...I now see how I acted...and I never want to act that way again...i hope she will forgive me, I would understand if she didnt...I say I want her to be happy, but today, I didnt act like that...I do only want her to be happy...and now...I will practice what I preach.  I dont want us to fall apart, I want us to make each other happy like we used to...and that is going to take restraint on my part which I will now do...It was like a slap in the face when I got home from her house...I suddenly woke up and realized what I was doing...and i hated myself for it...perhaps it will turn out to be a good thing...I feel like I got a part of myself back tonight...I feel like the Victor I used to be said, ""vic...what the fuck are you doing...you love this girl...why are you hurting her"" and in some ways...i snapped out of my emotional transe.  I called her after because I felt so horrible about what I did I thought that I needed to get her away from me so I didnt hurt her more...its was rash and i didnt mean what I said...i was still so overcome with painful emotion...something im still not used to... I hope she reads this, I want her to. So she knows how bad I feel...Perhaps we will never get back together...i want to very badly but its more important that she does what makes her happy...even if we dont get back together I always want her in my life...I never want us to be angry at each other.  Its time for me to collect my things and go find myself again... I had done so once before but I lost myself...I have to find myself again...so that if she comes back to me I have something to offer her...so that if she doesnt come back to me, I can still be me...the good me...

as horrible as I feel about what i have done to her...I must take this opportunity to help myself...now that i see how mean and cruel I can be...I have to ensure that I never act that way again...at least not to my taryn...not to the woman I love so dearly."

"event","I have decreed that online form of communication when used to convey intense emotions are the devil

that includes aim as well as live journal...thus from this day foward...i will no longer be using such things for social purposes...they create too much drama...pain...and the most deadly of them all...confusion and misinterperitation...i will write person entires and i will only use aim sparringly...thus ends the decree

score:
Victor: 1
Electronic means of conveyence: 0


ps...that picture of you is stunning and you know ill cuddle you any time to make you warm...i hope its me you want to run away with! sorry you had a bad day...ok...im already breaking my own decree...im done now...good day mi lady!   : )"

"event","I can handle 2 weeks.  She needs 2 weeks.  I never wanted her to feel guilty...or frustrated with me...and now i realize that thats what i was doing to her...before i was under the impression that she would be very glad to talk to me whenever...but i was wrong and its ok...now things can finally start to get clearer for the both of us.  

I hope this all works out for the best
I hope she finds our love again
I hope she comes back refreshed
I hope she finds herself
I hope she remembers
I hope she makes the decision best for herself
I hope she understands I love her
I hope she understands that i never wanted to make this hard
I hope she knows that i never wanted her to feel guilty
I hope she knows that in my eyes she is doing nothing wrong

I hope that these 2 weeks are just what the both of us need"

"event","this is getting out of hand...her and her girl friends are giggling about this like its some kinda joke...they all think i dont know whats going on...

its really starting to seem like taryn didnt just want to kiss doug...shes acting the way she acted when she first met me...this doesnt look like lust...

this very well could be the straw that breaks the cammels back...its too bad im the cammel right?  

the only reason im still in this ...wating to some degree...is because i love her so god damn much...i look at her as the perfect woman for me even though she may not be

any other sane man would have ended this cruel and unfortunate series of events a long time ago"

"event","Well all is settled in my heart for now...Its still tough but i have found a strange sort of peace.  She wants this other guy doug...and she really does want him its strange for me to think about that...she only wanted me for so long...but i guess it was bound to happen...at least she was respectful towards me and didnt cheat on me.  It just really hurts for me to think of this other guy kissing her at school...and her liking it...i suppose its 50/50 whether or not shell come back to me...i mean...if she kisses this guy and likes it...she could still come back to me...but it would be hard on me...I guess the best possible situation would be if she kissed him and felt nothing...but with all this tension and excitement building up in her...i doubt shell feel nothing...this is hard...but ive done hard things in the past...everything will turn out ok i hope.  I would be elated if she came back to me rejuvinated...thats all i can think about.  I just dont want her to fall in love with doug...this is always how it starts...a little spark the BAM love.  I know she cant help it but it seems like she can fall in and out of love very quickly...so i can only hope...sit back...let her have her space...let this other guy kiss her...let this other guy touch her...and hope she realizes the difference between his lame cross country excuses and my utter devotion...im not angry anymore ...which is good i suppose...ive made the decision to wait even though im being disrespected...even if its not on purpose.

i love her..."

"event","hard times are ahead for me...hard times indeed, I just hope the times dont last too long....i fucking hate suspense....i cant beleive what is happening, goes to show my brother was right....anything involving a relationship can change in moments...stability is overrated...i love her so much but she doesnt love me the same way, even after everything she has said.  i have this lurking suspision that she will call in a week or two and say, ""i think we should stop seeing each other""  then shell add, ""I stil will be your friend and youll always be my comfort and I love you, just not the way I used to""  I dont know if i can be the friend...I would, because I love her, but it would result in many hurt feelings on many occasions.  Between this and the incident in spain I suppose taryn does have a tendency to need multiple men in her life.  funny how easy it is to misread people.  I dont want to hold her back...I wont be the rock dragging her under...am I setting myself up for a lifetime of excrutiating pain?  I cant help but think that even if she does come back to me this sort of thing will happen over and over again.  Of course ill keep playing the sucker.  I say I wont now but I will.  

at this point...ill be honest...im angry, im lonely, im sad, i have tons of work to do, the one thing in my life that made those things go away was taryn, now I have to live without her not knowing whether or not shell come back.  

fuck it my consitantly wonderful life has finally come to an end...i suppose it was about time, i can see the past coming back, the insecurity, the skin problems, all of it rushing back to me.  Of course, ill toughen up agian...it wont take me too long,,,it never does, but shit, for now, taryn has left me raw and vulnerable emotionally, something i havent been in a while.  I hope this doesnt end poorly

with love in my heart and taryn on my mind
Victor"

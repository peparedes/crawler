is all it took 
to be slapped in the face with memories
almost instantly the tears start to make an appearance.
where did we go?
is this how we're going to be the rest of our lives?!?
muted whenever our names are spoken in the same sentence..?
i hope ur happy with ur new love.
i wish i could make u that happy again.

oh how i see a vision of the late night talks. 
i can almost hear ur voice.
ur laugh
the sound of our love.
the sound of happiness.

i miss the innocence
the way we would blush at the thought of more than kissing.

thinking back to my first time i start to regret.
i wanted it to be you.
but u were no where to be found.
every kiss we shared,every hug,every touch...i was wishing it was you.

im sorry for the things i said.
im sorry for never physichally being there when u needed it

i tried my hardest to devote my every second to you.
when ppl would speak of their doubts of our relationship i never believed them and said they were wrong.
our love would last forever. there was nothing wrong. and never did we think there would be.
little did we know they were right.
i hate it
i dont want to believe it.
please tell me we're not officially done.
im holding on in fear of letting go
fear that if i let go..then there no chance at all
i know i should
ive been told i should
but once again i dont want to believe
i want to say ""no youre wrong theres hope. just believe""
but oh how doubt is starting to linger around.

one word and i swear i'll be your's

...again"

"event","oh the pictures of ur affection
the pictures with someone else
how they bring back such familiar feelings
feelings that can not be described.
i remember thats the same look you gave me so many times before
the way u placed your hand on my cheek as you told me i was beautiful
the way you brushed my hair away from my face and kissed my nose
and oh how i cant forget the tight grip of our hands together
the way every minute or so you'd squeeze a little tighter to make sure we wouldnt ever let go...
then kiss the tips of my fingers
but then you let go...
...and grabbed her"

just give me up to my eternal rest so we will both be put at ease.
slide ur mouth over to my neck and knaw there.
my heart needs a rest.
my mind and body is craving the lust of previous hours,
the actions that took place making my blood rush faster than it ever has.
why not again?
just as my hopes were higher than we could ever fly they came crashing down
down upon myself
oh please bring the temporary fix
i feel myself becomming addicted
but it puts the warmth back in my body seeing as how its escaping thru this gaping hole in my chest
my insides are turning.
no food,no drink, just alcohol
oh such a great feeling
so great i cant stop
""beg for more"" my mind is screaming 
my heart tells me the same... just not as loud bc ur too busy silencing it with ur demonic ways
i just wanted to be the angel that brought you the light.
the one who was there to protect you through anything
why wont you let me?!"

the rats scatter thru the garbage.
the stream of water is the only thing keeping her awake.
shes applying preassure to her wound
the blood just keeps flowing.
where is it all comming from?!
she so cold she can barely move...barely scream
shes trying her hardest to scream for help
no one is listening.
is there any sound comming from her mouth at all?
or is it just her imagination?
the event that lead to\ this point is playing over and over again in her head.
what went wrong?
her chest is now a hollow cave
blood still everywhere
filling the small stream of water
and filling the blood thirsty rats
she finally lets go
lays both arms out and goes to sleep to never wake up.
in her had lies a note
""im sorry i had to do this. but ive found someone else"""

"event","Your bitter goodbye is ringing through this quiet night,
This idle hour just wont pass
I've never missed you this much, never thought I would,
Didn't think you'd feel so far away
Your summer perfume is still blowing through this hallway, 
Autumn's amber red shadows dance
I miss our midnight rides on highway 18, 18 is gone

So go past the lights and all the excuses
You could have left ""sincerely yours""
Don't you think it's obvious that I want to say more?
Cause anything too daring to say to you, 
Will be said in this letter, then burned away
So you never realize, I'm here

I'm thinking of your vague reply
So I can understand
Why we put this at rest
Why we forget to 
Say that we were leaving
Say that we were sorry
The past remains unspoken
As this vacant night is dying
But I still miss your summer perfume
This cold air brings such a distance to us
Such a painful distance
I'm still waiting for you to say you hate me now
So I don't have to hold on to this burning heart
This burning heart is getting old 
While sitting on this cold kitchen floor, 
Head down to hide the tears, 
I've finally realized that you were never meant for me"

200 miles beneath this lake is where my heart belongs
But you don't care at all
You wouldn't even smile if I were screaming as the water filled my lungs, oh my lungs
You demand to be chased for your love
My desperate heart is far too weak to run for you this long
But you don't care at all
There's nothing I can do to draw you close to me
Can you take this silence like a pill so I can breathe again
I've been trying to ignore the best parts of you
But I'm still hoping that I'll be with you somehow, somehow
Please be home tonight
I'll die if I don't get a chance to make this just right
I'm sorry but I can't forget about the way I feel
Every time you're here.
What would it take for me to be with you
I swear I'd rip my heart out if you said you'd be impressed, please be impressed
I'd go so far to please you but I bet you wouldn't care at all, oh at all
Hopeless love please leave me
This broken heart is far too weak to run for you this long
Why don't you care at all?
I'm dying for a place in your heart.
Can you take this silence like a pill so I can breathe again
I've been trying to ignore the best parts of you
But I'm still hoping that I'll be with you somehow, somehow
Please be home tonight
I'll die if I don't get a chance to make this just right
I'm sorry but I can't forget about the way I feel
Every time you're here.
Hopeless love, why did you carve your home in me?
This broken heart is too weak to hold your weight
And now I regret the day we met
And help me forget your name."

but i cant turn it off
just liek i cant just turn off my sadness
or turn off the tears from running
i wish i could just take my brain out...delete everything idont need
such as: depression
certain memories
the way i get jealous easily
my anger problems
the way i hold stuff in..and only let it out in here...or when someone pisses me off
my addictions
i want to delete him...but i dont know if id be able to

i want to put everything in my mind back into order
clean  out everytihng
get the dust off of old feelings
maybeuse them a little

maybe even dust off happiness.
that has the most dust of all"

i should really stop

but i dont know how.

i dont know whats wrong with me

iwant everything. but i cant get it
and when i see someone with what i want i freak out and get into a bad mood

everything at this moment is annoying the fuck out of me. i cant even ACT happy!

i want to just yell at everyone and tell them what it is about them thats annoying me

wtf is wrong with me.

ive gotten into this ""dont fuck with me"" mode

and im not caring about OTHERS feelings
i admit:
im selfish
i want to be better than most
i dont want anyone to have what i cant
i want to live a better life than my parents
i want my stepmom out of my life
i want to be pretty
i dont want to be here anymore
i want to die
i want to have him back
im confused
i dont know what to do in most situations
im easily intimidated
but i get over it fast
im emotional
i wish my stepmom would shut the fuck up
i want my mom to get her life back together
i want him to stop talking to her
i want her to fail
i want him to fail so he will crawl back to me
im lazy
i could care less about going out at night. or the day
im fine with staying in...most of the time.
i stay in  a lot bc i dont want my stepmom to go thru my stuff.
not bc im hiding sometihng,but bc its something she shouldnt be doing
i hate the way when im in a crowd with a boy i like and a prettier girl comes into view
or comes over to talk and they make a big deal and make her seem so much better than me
i dont want to eat anymore
i force myself to eat
i hate the way she taddles
i want to jsut talk shit on everyone
im never happy
hes always on my mind.
i get so angry so easily
im completly admitting it"

"event","this adulation that im feeling for you is exceeding past the time i wouldve thought
i mean yes i believe in forever but little did i know that after all this time of no ""us"" i would still be infatuated with you.
its ridiculous
the thought of you unhinges my mind and lets it loose. 
loose to wear i think of what couldve been but never was
loose to creating tears to run away from my eyes as if they just witnessed a murder in the most horrific way.
why do u mean this much to me?
why am i still believing in your false promises
this eternal love has fizzled out and theres nothing but a dark room where we both hide in seperate corners
hiding from telling eachother how we really feel. hiding from reality.
my views and perceptions of things have changed somewhat dramatically since the first time we have ever spoken.
what happen to the childhood love we had? our play ground romance?
we were so innocent
we would have never even thought of doing the things we do today...nor act the way we do.
why do this to ourselves?
to feel more grown up bc that is the opposite of what we were so you'd think it'd be a way to get over us?
or is it to make others believe we arent screaming for our lives inside?
i miss being the one who knew the exact words to say to being u somewhat closer to happiness. the one who fixed everything so u could sleep easier at night.
i still feel the cold emptiness without you.
the coldness of our favorite season of winter.
the snow is falling....but where are you to keep me warm
keep me safe?


make me feel whole again?"

"event",""" there will always be someone prettier than you"" she says to herself as she sees the beautiful girls pass her by.
 when she looks in the mirror on a normal feeling day...she then gets depressed. she cant stand the sight of her. why does she have to have this figure...this look?! 
she starts to get ready for a night out on the town. minute by minute shes trying her best to hide her imperfections. after about an hour or so she feels as if shes done a good job,she actually feels pretty for that moment.
then
she goes out.. looks around. and notices all the beautiful women, and much more prettier they are than her.
thats when she just hides.
she tries not to bring attention to herself.
shes no competition.
""there will always be someone prettier"" are the words mumbling out of her glossed up lips as that single tears rolls down her cheek and her head bows in sorrow.
why try?"

"event","i hate the fact that i cant admit to what i feel.
i dont want it
i dont want to feel this way anymore
its killing me
everytime i see it or hear it..my heart stops..my whole body goes knumb except for the inner lining of my stomach with the millions of butterflies fluttering ever so quickly. so much i want to throw up.
and hopefully along with the little dinner i ate will come that fucking feeling and everytihng else that lingers around with it.
Regret is starting to make its way around again. i thought i got over that...but its making a strong come back.
i wish it would all stop.
so long ive been like this
will it EVER go away.
or will the thought of ""what couldve been but never was"" stick in my head like glue for the rest of my life?
i know i didnt mean for things to be this way.. so why cant that certain someone see it?
why cant i fucking be forgiven 
why do you have to hate me the way you do?!
i did nothing but fucking care, and this is what i get
i love the way you deny everything
every feeling
that makes me feel so damn good about myself. makes me want to keep on with life...
SIKE
FUCK THAT
u make me feel like the lowest person
like i dont mean SHIT
like i was never ANYTHING to you
AND WHY?
.....you have no answer

"event","i miss my old best friends
i mean..i love the ones i have now
i love them to death
but i miss having the same group of ppl to turn to...to hang out with everyday...to be at eachothers house and just sit there in the fron yard/bedroom and not do anytihng..but still have the best time bc we were all together.
i miss having the same group of ppl to go to shows with
and if someone were looking for one of us..all they had to do was find another one of us..and we were always with them
and how after shows we would all go to mcdonalds
fkmnfld,bg kjnkdlgm bv
i want it back
why did i have to be so fucking dumb
atleast now 90% of us are friends again
not as close as we used to be...
but still friends
like rhianna just said ""i cant even listen to my old five minute ride cd without getting sad""
we all saw FMR together every single time they came to Lodi
someone bring it back...

"event","so mykey left.
it was so hard letting him go.
when we were in modesto at the bus station i cried pretty hard. we talked the night before about how he didnt tihnk i would bc im not that emotional. but daaaang, seeing him check in his bags and stuff made me cry soo bad. i didnt want to let him go. he's my best friend of alllllllllllll time. i love him with my life. him and i can do nothing and it still be the perfect time. 
we held onto eachother until it was his turn to board. i felt like i couldnt even breathe. i cried the whole way back. and when i finally did get back i found that he left his hat.... the tears came again. :(
I MISS HIM SOOOOOOOO MUCH


but LUCKILY! he's commming back in 2 weeks to see me again. i cant wait. my parents actually said YES!!!!!!

A state in which you think you can do something, or succeed in some way than others, but you can't you try but nothing happens. I need a change, a new place, a new school, a new something.....i just don't know what yet. I think that life just needs a mix up every now and then, i can't sit and wait for life, i'm gonna make it happen. I need something new , job, place,something. I'm not sure, i just can't sit on life, and thats what i've been doing. I just can't anymore. Grrrr......I need well....money first off.......and school......but i can't stand the same stuff. ..............i got nothin....i'm gonna go think more....."

"event","So things have begun to roll around, speed up, then slow down. They've been going up and down and sideways and that ways and long ways and every ways. Things are just here and there, and nowhere. I'm so lost in translation that i might as well be deaf. I think the heart of it is just me, and that confuses things even worse then this post. 

So where do you go from a stand still, so many choices to make in life. Which ones are right, which ones are wrong?? Does anyone know, can anyone even help you figure it out? I have so many questions, with so many answers i don't have. I think i am having a id-life crisis at the age of 19. That alone confuses me. I feel so torn, but so complete. What is this feeling. I know, i know, life goes on, and such. But does life just pause and just confuse your head? Mine does. 

I think i just really really need to find that second job i've been looking for to get my mind off of things. Maybe that will help. I really hope it does. I keep crossing my fingers about finding a new and fun job, but i just can't seem to get hired anywhere. Oh well, i just keep looking.

In the meantime, wade leaves on the 10th. So that is fun, and by fun i mean exhausting. I don't know what to say to him when he leaves, shit, i don't even know what to think anymore about it. 

Alright, i guess i'm doing myself in on the rantingness.

"event","&nbsp;So i worked tonight, not a big deal, not at all. The same thing night after night i go in.Oh well, i guess i should be thankful for some kind oconstant in my life right?&nbsp;

Besides that boringness, my love life is slowly getting more and more confusing. I feel so many different ways about different people. And then its like the one of two that i really wanna be with i can't , they either have someone, or its just too late. I feel like my love life is spiraling into hell. I hate it, i hate it soooo much, i wish i just had....her, i wish so much. I feel so helpless. Should i even feel this way, houldn't i just suck it up., move on and up to something better, or not? I can't answer that question, should i be able to? Ugh.....I need her, but she has someone, i want to be her friend, i wanna just be here for her, but then again, i wanna tell her that am totally falling in love with her, that i want to be with her more than anything right now. The worst thing is , that i have no idea what she thinks of me, is that terrible, i mean i can tell myself at she likes me, but i am so unsure that its killing me. Ugh....women......me......not a good mix apparently. Help.....


So i am almost finished x-mas shopping, so thats a good thing, i still have my dad, sister, and a few others to go. SO that is a good thing. I notice that i have a few random good things, which is better than none, Oh and i am finished with my first semester of COLLEGE !!!! yay me!!! , hey , i am excited...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1


OK, well, if i don't hear from any of you guys over break, i hope you all have a wonderful break, and christmas.&nbsp;

"event","OK, so, life is ......well.......life....is.<br /><br />So a lot of hings have been&nbsp;racing through my mind lately, and i don't know why. I am totally exhausted and all i am doing is typing these words right now, i&nbsp;I have been like this the past week, no make it three weeks. My brain just keeps going and i think about everything. I can't comprehend why my mind doesn't want to rest. Even when i do lay down to sleep, i just stay&nbsp;awake, eyes open uuntil i see the gray that fills my room. The things i think about are even weirder. I think about relationships, i think about school, i think about my family, i even think abou what the color blue would taste like, if we could taste it of course. Maybe i am&nbsp;cracking, maybe i am going nuts. I feel so torn about &nbsp;so many things.&nbsp;<br />I am meeting new friends, i miss old ones. I am starting new relationships, and i am in dire need of old ones. I don't get myself, is that a problem? REALLY&lt; IS IT?!?!?!?<br /><br />I feel good in the sense of school, work and my house. I mean work is easy and easy to catchup if i fall behind.Work is the same, i have one job, and i keep hearing from co-workers that i am quite good at this job of mine. And my apartment is finally pieced together how i want it right now, i have a desk,couch, table$chairs, DVD rack. It has all come together.&nbsp;<br /><br />I just can't seem to figure out what it is that is going on. I suppose a part of me just feels empty . I am the part of the milk glass that is half empty not half full. A shell without purpose or a soul.And man without a dream or friends to share it with.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have felt rather lonely lately, and being ho alone for 5 days doesn't help i bet. I need more fun, yes, i think that would do me good, more laughing i suppose, that is always a good thing.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>I twixt between thy self,&nbsp;<br />in thine everlasting flame.<br /><br />To start again and see&nbsp;<br />again, are ever such my bain.<br /><br />I feel thou arst so nine of me,<br />i look for those who weep.<br /><br />I seek the ones who share my fate,<br />and sink beneath thine feet.&nbsp;<br /><br />And soon the morrow come and go,<br />as if we never live.<br /><br />Until i find myself again,&nbsp;<br />betwixt of me i bid.<br /><br />To see mine own reflection,&nbsp;<br />is not of one i hail.<br /><br />To find my soul within&nbsp;<br />myself i bid thine mind farewell.<br /><br />To this i hold no consequence&nbsp;<br />For me i must let go.<br /><br />The day is long, but not so long,<br />that friends may come abold.<br /><br />And this by told i am thine self,&nbsp;<br />complete and nothing more.<br /><br />For the morrow has come and gone by now,&nbsp;<br />And seek i shall no more.<br /><br /><br /></em>So no you see my situation i am in, I am confused, tired, and my mind is going non-stop. Anyways, i hope you all are doing well, and not going crazy like me.<br /><br />love, travis"

I like the responsibility, weird huh?&nbsp;

Anways, as you can tell i finally got my interent set up at home, so thats good. I missed the net at home. So work is going good, i just got paid, so i am joyous. School, is well, school, you know homework and stuff, same ole same ole.&nbsp;

"event","First things first. I just finished my first week and two days of college, and i admit that i love it and hate it at the same time. I love the freedom, the fact i am treated like my own person, and how peaceful it is. I hate that i have bills[ thats just life right?], and the fact that all my friends are gone. I miss people so much, especially ones who are 6 hours away.I guess this is one of those growing up things, who would have thought right? Anyways, i just finished painting my third car, i think i have a knack for it or something, or thats what i hear. I am also joining the Webster tennis team next week, how fun.The more i play the more i love the sport, and the more i push to be the best.All my classes are fun this semester and pretty relaxed, just a few papers here and there, not to bad.I miss all you peeps on Lj too, i want to see you people, COME SEE ME, NOW!!!! but really i do miss a lot of you guys, and it would be good to see you all soemtime or somethng.

Ok, besides the normal life or becoming a big boy.Life is ...well.....life. Oh i am getting an apartment too, if i didn't mention that already.




Every time i get up in the morning, i look in the mirror and wonder if i still know me? Do you ever feel that way? It keeps happening more and more often.It is as if you are loosing yourself in, well, yourself. As if you are running away from the person in you. I just stand there and look at myself and thoughts run through my head like a bullet. Things like, Ar you the person you want to be, or the person people want you to be? Or are you honest with youself anymore? Or even things like, Who are you ? And Where did Travis go? It is like i am living in someone elses body or something, as if my feelings aren't even mine. Like the thoughts and remnints of my old self are completely gone and non-existent.

Maybe i am just loosing my mind or going crazy, what else is new right?

Maybe i am not looking hard enough to find myself, i'm not sure, about anything anymore. My best guesstimation would be stress or fatigue or stress or fatigue or that i am actually worn out for once in my life. I do feel rather empty, empty in the sense of being out of fuel to go. Like my body wants to stop but my mind keeps pushing everyday. Day after day of strain on my body from lack of sleep, college, chores around my house i am still in, and work WORK on top of it. Now that i think more i do ache almost everywhere, and my left arm has been giving me trouble. If you don't know my left arm was motionless for a month after my Celica wreck, and i broke my shoulder blade. But i am still going and moving, i just feel slow.

ok after writing all that i realize it comes off as a little like complaining, or a lot, but oh well.

Anyways, i think i have the best conclusion that might help me out.&nbsp; Maybe i am just dying?never know?



ok, i need sleep for my long day ahead.


love and things,&nbsp;

"event","So i definitly have been doing a lot of thinking lately.well, and a lot of writing. I dunno, its like life with all your expectations and people who you love sit beside you just pass you by. Like your so caught up in whats right and whats wrong, whats cool,whats the way to be,and what life is all about. but when its all over, absolutly none of that matters. its none of those things. Life in all its justice is what you want YOU want it to be, not what someone says it should be, or the way it should be. The biggest problem with almost half the world is that they worry about how they're supposed to be and who they're supposed to be, and not on just who they are. Be yourself for christ's sake. Stop worrying about popularity and if bobby joe the coolest person ever is gonna like you and just be yourself. God damn its not that hard, just walk in front of the mirror and see what you are and find that person you are and be that , don't be someone or something your not. But then don't make my mistake buy trying to be yourself so hard that you look to your past and get stuck their on a bike accident. Yes, that could have happened diffrent , but it didn't and i can't change that, and i realize that.


anyways, just had to write.
so this week is going alright i guess. band is looking better,which is always good. 
school work isn't too bad, and life isn't too bad at all. well, i hope you guys all have a good week.

loveto all,

SOme people hate me, some don't like me, don't wanna be around me, or  they yell at me. ye si know you guys care, yes your ""here"" for me. But i'm going crazy right now, and sometimes its hard to pick up a phone. I feel weak , like i can't handle my own problems and have to run to someone else. Thats why i don't call you guys. {well, when i call certain people they get their other friends to yell at me for calling, tell me to never call again, and thus i get yelled at for caring} so anyways, i'll update again tomorrow.

"event","ok, so i've officially found out that i have no one. And don't post on here and say ""ohh you have me"". I really am not saying any of the follwing to throw a pity party so if you dont' care then stop reading now.
   Ok, so i really can't do ANYTHING right. I can't be a good, as we all know boyfriend. I can't at all be a friend. And i definely can't ever be a good or coring person. Apparently, i'm pretty much worthless. So i guess i'm gonna live my life without anyone. No one cares,but i still do. So i guess that means i'm the bigger person. I've tried i really have. I try to be nice, i try to care so much, and i try my hardest to please everyone. But i can't and i regret it.because i have no one. I mean geese. I know someone who was in a reltionship kinda like me and erin's and it took them less than a weeek to still be friends. and yet i still can't make her happy. I really just make erin's life horrible i guess. I dunno, i'm just breaking down right now, and have no clue what to do. I have no one to run to. I'm trapped. And i know i'm gonna regret half the things i just said. But i don't kow what to do. But i have no one. so i'll go. sorry for ever wasting anyones time. I still care and love you guys very much, and i thought i'd have someone when i needed them. But i guess my hard work at being friends, and trying to be a good boyfriend at once, have never, and never will be good enough. I feel so let down and betrayed by my best friends, and most of all by my best friend in the whole world. erin.

"event","so, if you haven't heard or anything, erin broke up with me. But i;m ok, yeah, i'm ok. 
I mean there is a lot i woul dlike to say, but just to her, not the world, so i won't say it on here. i'll keep it in, it seems better that way. i lost my best friend anyway, so why should any one else care.

             anyways, ELS is back!!!!!!!!!!!! yeah!!!!!!!!111

ok, so today was alright i guess. Some things are seeming to get harder and harder. But what can you do. MY lie is falling down around me, and just when you think your low, it gets lower. But i'm strong , well at least thats what i hear. We'll see won't we? If i'm not broken by tomorrow or at least Friday, i'll be amazed. We'll see, i mean we will all see. Because if i break, it'll be the worst time i've ever broken, and i don't think i'll get out of it. But, some think i'm strong so i'll go on that for now. I just pray that i am. I'm sorry but i have to say this. 

I really feel like you left me right when i need you the most in my life. Between my mom hateing me, my dad regreting to know me, or claim me as his son. Then to top it all off, i'm loosing friends. But some think i'm strong, and i'll go on that.

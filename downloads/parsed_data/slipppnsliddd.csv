"event","<P><FONT color=#66cccc>to update yalll on my current life situation...the last person in the world that will ever enter my heart again will be jackson wise...sometimes nothin you do makes sense... especially when you spend 8 and a half months making something work when everyone you have ever trusted has told u that it isnt worth it... but sometimes you have to fuck yourself over just to learn that theyre right... and to actually listen to the people who tell you the truth... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#66cccc>and ive learned not to lie. because when you lie andhave people to lie to cover up for your lies you forget whats the truth and what uve told people...so truthfullness is so fucking much easier.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#66cccc>OH YEAH and above all.. dont trust people who just wanna spread shit.. like this one girl i know who just decides to tell ""secrets""she promises to keep. esp. people who pull out certian body hair... such as ... oh... say... EYELASHES </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#66cccc>and dont ever beleive anyone who says that theyre gonna love you forever... or that your the only one...or that theyre never gonna leave you. or that no matter what you do... nothing will ever come between you. and that no matter what theyre never gonna love anyone as much as you. whatever. bullshit. no guy tells the truth about shit like that... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#66cccc>UNLESS.... theyre cool with not having sex. they want to hang out with u ... and ure family... they call when they say they will... they give a shit about how ure day went... and the whole time on the phone... you dont just talk about how goddamn in love the two of u are... you talk about real things... like have actual conversations. and they actually TRY to fix the things they fuck up... ...i didnt know that thats what having a real boyfriend was...because id never had one like that...but now i do :) </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffcc99>whatever just thought id say my shit... and just get it out...ill be writing in here more cause i actually have shit to talk about other than jackson</FONT><FONT color=#ffcc99>.</FONT><FONT color=#ffcc99> ;)</FONT> </P>

"event","i swear...sometimes i dont know how me and jackson can fight...cuase i know that i love him with all my heart...but i get so tired of having to deal with both of our mood swings...i eman sometimes we say the worst things ever to each other...but we can never stay mad at each other...i guess when u find the person ure supposed to spend the rest of ure life with...if gets to the point where u put ure feelings aside just to be able to stay in love with that one person. 

the best things in life are never the easiest...loving jackson is the easiest thing in the world for me...but not being selfish and getting over somethings is one of the hardest. its like...we keep bringing up each others past mistakes just to hurt one another...but its killing us...i never ever want to lose those perfect moments we have...because in truth? were more in love than either of us thought we ever could be...with anyone...

jackson wise is the only boy i can honestly look at and say...""you...only you...are the person i live to love"" but i forget sometimes...what got me here. i mean i never grew to love jackson...cause i fell. completely. in love with him.  my all friends know that i have had tons of boyfriends...but my best friends understand why me and jackson are so special, becuase ive never been this pressed over anyone...i love him like i love my BEST friends...and then 1000 times more. that boy is my life. 

i mean...but then we fight...and i wonder why i stick around just to feel like shit all the time..but u know what? i live for the good times we have...the good times were gonna have...all the things hes said to me...and the first time we made love...the way its always perfect...the way ive never felt that close to anyone...i mean i know everyone who reads all these entries is gonna be like damn that girl is obsessed. but u know what? i wouldnt have it any other way :)

god love is so crazy... cause you do things you never thought youd do...like listen to every cheesy love song and finally understand what they mean...doing things that seem so childish but now they make sense...like looking at stars and wondering if the person you love can see the same one...and praying that they can cause that can make you feel like ure not a million miles away from each other...or even 500...i remember when other boys were my WORLD like i used to cry praying that theyd notice me...and now when boys DO notice me i wish they wouldnt..cause i only want jackson to look at me...i dont know what it is... but ...i used to have the world and i thought i didnt have anything worth holding on to...and now i realize that i have nothing worth letting go of...

"event","so i just got off the phone with jackson...lemme just say a lil about him :) ive never had anyone be as in love with me as he is...i mean like...when i was going out with david thomas... that kid was WHIPPED... like crazy whipped...lol and then he dumped me and dated kelley finnegan and then he wasnt whipped anymore :-/ lol but uhhh and like then i had like eric be obsessed with me and like nathan does anything in the world that i could possibly ask him to and scott... well never mind... 

but god damn ive never had someone be like so concerned with how i was feeling and shit... i mean i know we have our fights...and i know we bitch each other out and do some mad stupid shit to each other... but we still are BEST friends and care completely about one another... 

i mean i really thought i was in love with some of the guys ive dated...but seven months of fighting and not giving up during those fights...  even when we wanted to...can really make you learn alot about yourself...like how the things you thought you would never forgive someone for doing really arent that important when you compare them to losing someone you love with all your heart... 

like me and jackson... our lives almost revolve around each other... like we tell each other almost everything...he knows more about me than any other person on the face of the planet...and i know everything about him :) and when you can tell each other ure most embarrassing moments...and not feel embarassed at all or compromise what you thought you KNEW just becuase the person that ure in love with tells you something you never thought of before...or tells you that something you never really cared about means something special to them...

you begin to look at life, and love in a completely different perspective... and you begin to love it...

just thought id vent that :)"

previously...i told my dad to fuck off and (how white trash is this) he tried to WASH MY MOUTH OUT WITH SOAP...yes yes an actual bar of dial soap...my family is haggard beyond belief.

so then he deletes my internet connection... but clever as i am i have recovered it!!! yes!!! lol and yesterday was me and jacksons 7 month anniversary...dear god im not sick of him yet so something must be working out...that boy is something else :)

so i think that im gonna start doing this live journal shit...preferably becuase i have no super cool siblings to vent to and my signifigant other *thats you jackson* is 500 miles away... so i shall talk to myself on this here website (can u say hAgGaRd??) 

so that is all for now... i will update soon! yay for this thing...wow so much cooler than those fucking annoying blurty things... good lord... that word in itself is like an anurism waiting to happen. 

and OMG yes as i was talking to **hott guy** in the library (as me and marianne call him), my english class which was sent to study hall becuase mrs. williams was not present...was RETREIVED and brough back up to the classroom to take the fucking BLACK BOY test... but was i there to take it? NO becuase i was in the library... not the cafeteria where i was ""supposed"" to be... so much for nonconformity...see where it gets me? and F... so fuck mrs. williams and fuck hott guy... lol cuase hes annoying... lol sike...but definitly fuck that BLACK BOY test.

oh and in other news... my dad randomly started talking to me about how he hates taxes and he thinks that anarchy is the way to go and i quote 

""anarchy! anarchy! kaitie why cant we just have anarchy!?!""~my dad

thats all for now

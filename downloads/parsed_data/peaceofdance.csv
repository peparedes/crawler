I don't feel very well, I think I'll just go and lay down for a bit. :(
Don't think I'll be around much for a little while, have to take care of myself, and sort some things out. Sorry, you guys...


Fumi? Love you."

"event","Would this be considered a collective living of sorts? I mean, everyone seem to know everything about everyone, and peoples lovelife is hung out like yesterday's laundry. I don't mind it, really, but it takes some getting used to, I suppose...

Didn't move much today. Far too sore... :O"

"event","One word:

Strawberry flavored marshmallows. 

Okay, so that's three words. But whatever.
I ran 2 kilometers today. (Not much but I got short of breath far too fast. >_>) So I thought I'd treat myself a little something.

Marshmallows...

O_o And is it just me or are you guys seriously flirting with each other?

I spent some time tweaking it so it looks uh, very... I don't know. Pinkish. But a dark (almost) manly pink, I hope. Or something. Well, whatever...
I just recently moved here, to the Haremhood (what kind of name is <i>that</i>??!!) and I'm settling in. I've been out running today, gotta keep up with my exercise... :x Yes. And now I'm going to try and hunt down some food. Maybe. 
Laters! ~&hearts;"

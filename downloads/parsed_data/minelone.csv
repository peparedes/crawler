"event","Ahahahahahaa!!!! Ick, well, my life's weird right now. Or, maybe I should say that nothing is going on, that is right.
Can't believe I said that while laughing at first.
My room mate is back, after about two weeks vacationing in her family home. She sounds happy, now. Heck, she even look a little thinner. Hm, does staying at your family home will affect you that much?
This week had been hectic, for me. I mean, at Monday, 6 p.m. I found out I had a thesis due at midnight. So, rush, rush and at last, its done. Then, on Tuesday... well, Tuesday is free. Lucky, I spent some hours napping in the library's sofa in the basement. Had a strange dream, though. There was a girl, and a boy and a horse.... It was a crude dream... Really, really Crude.... I was kinda hoping I did not make any weird sound or something like that, because if I do, I am never going to that level in the library ever again! Ever! 
Then, that night, my recorder come! It can record sound and everything. I spent hours trying to link it to my computer... Hours! It was interesting, though. Then, Wednesday was spent trying to prepare for my in-class document analysis, which happen today. Very, very frustrating. I mean, I know all the things she said, I memorize everything, and what come out was so disconnected with my teacher's lectures. I hope I did okay on that, though. I'm very, very worried about it. 
Now is Thursday, and I should be preparing for my essay,which is due tmr.... ach, wish me luck, please. That I may survive tommorrow and everything.

I went to Toronto last Saturday, though. I was stocking up on happiness and shopping to last me through the week. I am so glad that I went, because I was offered to join my friends watching ballet next Friday. It is about Romeo and Juliet. Huh, nice. I want to see, and if it's (ballet) is nice, then, I want to see 'Giselle', another ballet. I know the story of 'Giselle', and it seems so sad but fascinating.

Oh, and tommorrow is my friend's b-day. Huh, must not forget to say happy birthday to her, then."

"event","I hate this. 
Knowing that my parents are right and I'm wrong, knowing that I won't ever be able to measure up to anything for them. I don't know what to do, I feel so lost. 
I need to involve myself in the society. Get to know people and have lots and lots of friends. Especially boys, as that will help me get to know the human minds. I need to open myself to others. I need to be friendly and good and everything that I can and can't be. I should be something that I am and I am not. 
I don't want to go home. I don't want to go back. 
I'm so cold. My room feels so cold. 
I need to get away from everything. 
Help me, God. 
Can you hear me? Please?"

"event","Gawd.... I'm so, so worried right now. I just can't do this. I mean, my exams results! Oh Gawd, my GPA and just, just my result. I can't face it. I'm so scared that I'll get less than 65 for my major. Just, so... so.... worried. 
I am not worried about my other subjects, but I am so worried and scared for my major subject. How wrong is that? My major subject should be the one that I ace. However, it is the opposite for me. 

I'm very, very scared for my econ 202 marks. However, I think I did okay for my Eng. literature and psychology. I did fine in my politic, though. 

In typical style of me, I did not tell my parents about this. I mean, usually I will talk to my parents if there is 1 subject that I can't seem to do. However, this semester, I did not tell them. I am just so nervous about this. Nervous, worried, scared. Is it any wonder that I just can't fall asleep even though I've been in bed for hours? 

I envy one of my friend, whose uni. was closed for a month because of a strike. It was closed at the end of the semester too. That means, no exams and longer holiday for her. I wish my uni. do that too. The uni might even reimburse the students and allow students to retake their courses too. I wish, I really, really wish I was in my friend's shoes. I might get bored out of my mind, but I can live with bored.

On the last day of exam/school, there is a snow storm in the afternoon. Another friend of mine's exam was on that day. However, because of the weather, the exam's date is changed into next year. Lord, why can't I be as lucky? I wish I can be in her shoes too. 

I just worried, anxious, scared, nervous for everything.

I am worried about my life. My everything. I know I'm basically whining, but I just can't stop. Where should I start? Let's see, my parent's expectation of me is down the drain. My education is the equivalent of rubbish. My love life is and had always been non-existent. My social life .... Just, just -there's no other word to describe it- suck, royally. `

I wonder, what will happen if I shove a horrible mark of econ and an 80+ marks of politic to my parents. 
But then again, what can I do with a politic degree? Even my mother seems to doubt that. Damn my life."

I've so many things to write, so many things to unload, vomit out to the world, that I'm confused of what to write. mmm...</p><p>Yeah, let's see. I'm done with another semester in uni right now. I'm 20 years old now. I tried my first ice wine. I saw a 'duck rescue mission'. I try to be religious and failed miserably. I'm in my christmas- new year- semester end holiday. My parents (mother) fought with my aunt. My younger brother in Mississauga, Canada, in my old high school. My friend's uni's TAs are on strike, which causes her school to close since Nov. and causes her to miss at least a month of school and final exams. There's a snow storm last Friday and there might be 2 more before Christmas. Damn, it's really cold here. feel like -25<br /><br />Now, really, where should I start? The end or the beginning? <br />Right, lets start with the newest and end with the oldest thoughts.<br /><br />I watched a movie just now. 'The Lakehouse'. It's very, very touching. In a way that makes you want to smile or laugh and just go &quot;aaawwww.....&quot;. It's good that I can watch the movie and all that, but it feels wrong at first. No, I don't mean the movie, I mean the surrounding. I mean, I'm in my room, with all the light on, and there's NO AMBIENCE. I mean, it's already pathetic that I'm watching a romantic movie, alone. Let's not start with the surrounding, which is my messy room, and uuurrgghh... Let's face it, I'm a pathetic fool. <br />But then again, I realize that for romance, I prefer them either romantic drama or tragic.&nbsp;Ack, now what does that tell about me?<br /><br />Now, my plan for tomorrow.... get out of the house, get some battery operated dim light, prepare food, coffee and things, and after that, just watch movies all day long..... Yeah..... sounds good. Just prepare some tissue and all that. But hey, at least tat mean I can enjoy the holiday. And who knows, maybe I'll get inspired to write something good. Uhhuh....</p><p>Yup, good plan<br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","I am so confused rigt now. I am just unable to make a decision. No, maybe I am just afraid. I mean, I seems to be unable to go for a good business program, therefore, I am stuck with my economic major. Not only that, when I think about&nbsp; economic, it come to my mind that my older bro is an excellent math economist, while me, nothing. 

I am trying to branch into an economic major that would require less math, but two question; does it even exist, and can it support my future?
Two of my cousins seems to be in that branch of econ, and 1 work as a secretary while another is still jobless, lounging in his house, as he refuses to work-even a work that his father offer-.
I am afraid to be like them, as my mother pointed out while laughing. I don't think my mother would like it if I do take that branch of economic. However, I m just afrais.

My mother wants me to be able to pursue a master, and its just so hard. I am not confident that I am able to keep up with the required grades. I mean, I tried my hardest already. 

Besides that, to be able to pursue a master, one needs to be at least in honours, but now, I am currently in 3-years general. People tell me that one is able to cange from general into honour, is one has the required grades. However it is just so disencouraging for me.

Can I really keep up? Will I even be able to get the grade required? I am so afraid, so doubtful."

"event","<p>&nbsp;At last!!! At last&nbsp;I am free again. Free to write and moan and wonder. I wonder, how many people actually read what I have written? How many people actually read a random blog/journal of a nobodies?<br />Hmmm.... ya know, now that I think of it, never mind. I don't want to know what stalkers are out there!!! Mr. Stalkers!!!!! I'm scared!!!!<br /><br />Muahahahahaha..... I just feel so random today..... Urgh, I just finished my finals. I am just so tired. I mean, just tired and empty. As if those finals had sucked the marrow of my bones. These few days, I just feel these ways. I don't understand why. Maybe because I will have to move? I mean, I am going home at the 14th after all. Then, when I come back to Canada, I will have to move house to somewhere off-campus. It's scary. I mean, however many times I have to move out of the old place and go to a new place, I will still be afraid. Not that anyone should know about this.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes, I feel as if I had been cut off from society, even from my own family. I mean, when I was 10, I move out of my family house to go somewhere across the country to live with my aunt and her family, for knowledge. Since then, I have never spend a full year with my own blood family. Do you think that had affect me somehow? Even now, I still can't let others in. I befriend others, but I still won't talk to them that often or go out with them. Hell, I won't even go out to dinner with my own older brother, dammit! I mean, do those people that call themselves my friends really knows me? And if they don't know me, is it because of me or is it their fault? Somehow, I believe that it is my own fault. I just seems to be unable to stay as friends, in long term period. I mean, some of my closest friends live in other city and somehow I find myself not talking to them just because. I mean, even my friends that live in the same city as me are not close with me.&nbsp;<br /><br />I seems to be hooked on fan fictions right now. I mean, I found them to be easier to deal with than the real world. I mean, however sad those stories are, they just seems to be so perfect. Heroes and heroines, magic and potions, legends and myths, stories of old. It is easier to read than to deal with real people.<br /><br />&nbsp;In reality, people are unpredictable. It is difficult for me to relate to others. Yes, I do wish that I can be someone that is surrounded by people. I wish my life is perfect, with fairytale's ""happily ever after"".&nbsp; I wish to have a family, friends,a career, etc etc. I won't wish for some kind of miracle, or some kind of fairy tale adventure like saving a princess or anything. I'm just to old to believe in that.</p><p>However, just because I seems to be cutting off myself from the real worlds does not mean that I am fine. On the contrary, I hate being alone. I hate not being with anyone. I hate not having someone that I can smile with. Keh, some people might call me desperate. I mean, I does sound desperate, doesn't I?&nbsp;<br /><br />Huf... I finished my math for economist exam. It is hard, difficult. I don't know whether to cry or just break down. I gave up on the middle of the exam, do you know? When I saw the exam, I realize that it was not a collective exam, even though the prof said that it was! God, I just wish I can pass this exam. I tried, I do tried. However, I just don't see how I could. I panicked, do you know.... I panicked when I saw the exam. I was shaking for the first half of the exam. Then, I somehow gave up, and tried to do my best. However, I don't think that my best is enough. </p>"

And of course, he will be with his friend, while I'm alone. I wonder who the fuck does he think he is? I will try to watch the bloody game, but the hell!!! I just want to go home, back to a place that I know, to the people that I know. I want to be busy doing something that I know. Why me, damn it!!&nbsp;<br /><br />I know I sound shallow, but the hell, man. I have been with him for 4 days straight. I woke up, and I saw him. I went shopping, and whose face does I see? Blody hell, man!!!! Its as if some moron of a fucking stalker is with me. Fucking shit!!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />Its just that he doesn't know how to communicate with me or something. I mean, all that he does is belittle me or insult me or something. I never hear him speak politely to me except in front of strangers, which&nbsp;means, my friend or his friend. I mean, I bet when Saturday come and I am supposed to tag along wit his friend and him, he will be so bloody polite and good and nice. Why!!<br />Why can't I go home alone? That way, I would be happy, he would be happy, and his friend will be happy. What the fuck, man!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />He will be alone with his friend and happy watching his beloved baseball, while I will be happy in my own room, resting my ass....&nbsp;<br /><br />Sigh... what the hell is wrong with him, man. Why can't my bro speak less insultingly and more understanding? I just want him to stop insulting me, stop calling me names, JUST STOP, DAMMIT!!!!<br /><br />I can't see what the heck is so great about watching a baseball game. No hard feeling with all the baseball fans out there,&nbsp;<br /><br />But when I ask him, he said that he's just watching for fun... Hell, if he think its fun to watch, okay, he is more than welcome to watch. However, that doesn't mean that I think baseball is fun.<br /><br />I hate sport in the first place. I mean, I rarely even do sport. Hell, I don't even go the gym, man. Why? Why can't I just skip the bloody game and go home? How hard is itto go home to waterloo by bus myself? It's not even my first time, damn it.<br /><br />Now, now, I bloody remember why the fuck does I hate being too long with him.<br /><br />Toronto trip -snort- more like torture!!!</font></font>"

Heck, my friends who also studies here had never meet me that often. Twice a day is twice too many. But then again, I couldn't do anything. I sign up for writing clinic today. Not too bad, and its just 2 hours per week, which is just one day per week.

A fter this will be the yoga. Ah, well, one step at a time. I guess I am feeling okay right now. Calm and relaxed. Well, I am just waiting for another bad news to come. I don't know what or why, but I have a feeling that other bad things will happen. After all, since when does my life not sucks. I know I sounds like a pessimist, but what else can I do?

I mean, I just met him today after a term of not meeting him&nbsp;and feel like killing myself tonight. No, don't worry, I am too much of a coward to off myself.&nbsp;<br /><br />Before he come here, I was fine, I thought life is good and all that jazz. Then, he just come and voila....&nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, me the failure and irresponsible person that I am. Yeah, I can't compare myself with him, as he is always better than me, especially in my parents eyes. He's responsible, he's always working out, he's hardworking, smart, open, money smart.... All that parents want their child to be. How different he is from me. I'm always irresponsible, a spenthrift, plump, and lazy. I am a failure if compared to him. Maybe that's why I don't like living near him. Because I will always be judged against him and will always be found lacking.&nbsp;<br /><br />After all, lets compare him to me. He is hardworking, and therefore, smart. That's why he always have the high marks in every subjects. Heh, my mother said that the lowest average that he has in a term is 77. While me, whoa, just come to uni. and all I got is an average of 61. How different. Then, I couldn't pass my English Language Placement Exam. Of course, he pass it with just one try. Some of my friends said that they didn't pass it until the third time and they were Canadians' born too.&nbsp;<br /><br />I didn't tell my parents this news, as I know that <u>I still have a chance of retaking this ELPE</u>. Of course, when my brother asked about it, I couldn't lie and truthfully tell him that I fail. Yep, I bet a hundred bucks that my brother will tell my parents too.Conclusion, writing clinic. For which, I will have to skip my first class to attend. Smart, isn't it.&nbsp;<br /><br />God, sometimes I wish... I don't know, I wish I am as perfect as him, but I'm not.... I am trying damn it! I am trying my best to be like him. I try my hardest but its just not enough......<br />What a way to celebrate the new term, crying my eyes out in front of the computer alone. What a sissy I am. If my parents see me they would have scolded me for being dramatic or weak or crying over nothing.......<br /><br />I am trying my hardest to study. I try to listen and take notes and study, and study, and study some more. But I am just dumb that way. I stayed up all night to study, drinking vast amount of coffee just to stay awake.....Useless. I just managed to get black rings under my eyes, for which my parents scold me too.&nbsp;Heh, not only study, now come the exercising and fitness part. After all, my brother grow thinner here. He become fit and all that. While me, I rarely go to the gym. After all, its hard getting to the gym when you live half an hour away (by bus) from campus. And its not even counting the waiting time too. Heh, and the fact that I usually need to go home before dark is not counted too.&nbsp;<br /><br />What about friends? What about other things? Lets not talk about that, as the conclusion is still the same. My brother is better than me. I wouldn't be surprised if one of my parents actually called me to scream and shout at me soon.<br /><br />You know something? Why do I even try?

I mean, what kind of wimp wear a thermal pants anyway? However, as a former resident in a tropical country where the lowest temperature was 27, I believe that I have the right to do what I can to survive the newly introduced winter.&nbsp;<br /><br />I will be 19 soon. Next Tuesday, actually. Sweet isn't it? I hope it will snow that day. I don't even mind if the snow is at night, as long as it snow. I mean, the secret romantic in me said that even if no one celebrated it with me here, at least I can pretend that my birthday is special somehow. But, its ok. Even if it doesn't snow, I know that its alright. I mean, I can still go to Starbucks and get some coffee. Caramel machiato... mmm.... Very nice....<br /><br />I am a closet romantic.

How are you tonight?
Do you still remember me,
or am I just another girl you pass?
Just another girl romanced in the moonlight.

Do you ever think of me,
am I too unimportant to spare a thought for.
Forgotten after the first date
Left after the pretty little blonde.

Beloved but not a lover
reminiscent with a smile and tears
remembering until no feeling left
saddened but smiling always.

Beloved,&nbsp;

I am entering university now. I begin to depend on myself and no one. Yet, I realize that now, I have to ask about many things to different people, to strangers.

This brought me to my question, is it better to be book smart or street wise?&nbsp;

Each of them have different potential. By being book smart, I will be assured with jobs on a high position. However, how much of that book smart could help me in a real world?&nbsp;

What about being street wise? If I am street wise, I can survive anywhere, anytime. However, what should I do to excell in my career? I would need that book education in my job.&nbsp;

<P>saturday...&nbsp; i went to ashley's with michele and we worked on our project and chilled and they helped me feel better because i looked like shit and was still crying because of my mom...&nbsp; like we really need counseling in my family, no joke, because some how i'm getting yelled at every two seconds; which isn't reasonable compared to how good a of a child i am compared to some of the kids nowadays...&nbsp; whatever...&nbsp; then saturday night i went to the musical with ashley michele... and i got kyle to go :)&nbsp; haha...&nbsp; wesley... you were spectacular!&nbsp; lol</P>
<P>sunday... I went to church early so I could go to the womens' breakfast which was soooo&nbsp;good, oh man!&nbsp; Then my lovely Jessica was lay assistant so i got to see her...&nbsp; afterwards i went home and got yelled at some more, and cried some more...&nbsp; seems like a daily activity now...&nbsp; what fun!&nbsp; At 2:00 I went to a concert for personal enrichment... which just reminded me i have to do that tonight, CRAP!&nbsp; Anyways, I went with michele and i saw mr. Garrison (the wonderful man who taught me to play the flute) perform... and then we ran into Rob so we all got to chill...&nbsp; right afterwards i got yelled at some more :(&nbsp; then i got dropped off at kyle's at 4:00 and hung with him until 7 ish...</P>
<P>monday...&nbsp; went to school and crap, which was crap... and we had a scary assembly... and then band was fine, and i was starving the whole time in science...&nbsp; but i got the nicest compliment because mr. fidelman told me i would make a wonderful teacher someday...&nbsp; and i'm remembering how much i want to be a teacher becauise of that class because i get to teach a lot because i understand everything...&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Gym sucked because the big block head guys don't listen to anyone else and i was almost gonna cry because i couldn't get in two words of my ideas so i sat and just did everything they told me, wtf...&nbsp; one day they will lose, and i will win!&nbsp; lol...&nbsp; but probably not anytime soon....&nbsp; :(&nbsp; after school i went to see Harriman because I missed him and we had a nice talk, and then I visited Mr. Burkhardt because I miss him...&nbsp; I thought he was great even though nobody else does :(&nbsp; After that I was in the car for 15 minutes doing stuff with my mom and then she dropped me off at Kyle's and I stayed until 7:00 and huing with him and Patrick...&nbsp; who found out how sexy Kylie is ;)&nbsp; *you all know it's true*</P>
<P>today...&nbsp; crap friends wise, except i love jes and saba-daba...&nbsp; and i got THREE 100's today :)&nbsp; I'm so excited...&nbsp; and they were all quizes so i can bring up my grades :)&nbsp; Now I'm in study hall and there are 10 minutes until the bell, and stuff, and there are some rather annoying girls here, but oh well...&nbsp; me and saba are WAY smarter than them, and they were talking about having sex, ut oh!&nbsp; Better be safe... but it would be funny if they got pregnant :)&nbsp; Well that's about it... and I hope Ashley gets better :)</P>

<P>Science~ TOO funny... Mike broke the phone and then when the lady calle dback she was all pissed at him for hanging up, but he didn't the phne broke and our whole class was laughing hystercially...&nbsp; then we were working on some solar system stuff and I made up a song for Mr. Fidelman and he liked it a lot, lol, i was really bored and hyper...&nbsp; Not to mention me and Nick got to sing...&nbsp; ""ooh, just a little bit, ooh, little bit more...""&nbsp; lol...&nbsp; he kne wmost of the words too, so now he's my good friend :)&nbsp; lol</P>
<P>Lunch~ Well, crazy as usual, and then this kid Kyle had sugar from dunkin donuts...&nbsp; and I was like, oh man, you can blow that stuff reall well... confusing and hard but it's funny when you can do it right...&nbsp; but this kid couldn't, so I made him give me a pack of it, and I got ready and blew it ALL over Shaun, quite funny, well, until he decided to beat up Kyle becase of what I did, lol...&nbsp; but it was good while it lasted, lol</P>
<P>Gym~&nbsp; I felt like a very good swimmer, I can do crawl stroke very well and neatly, lol...&nbsp; idk, i felt powerful, because i was actually good at something in gym...&nbsp; BUT when it came to water polo, i wasn't exactly WONDERFUL, lol...&nbsp; but that's ok, i got to splash Korey in the face over and over again, lol...</P>
<P>After school Kyle and I walked home to my house, and we saw Court and Shawn, so we walked partially with them, lol..&nbsp; and what we did at my house is between me and him ;)&nbsp; lol...&nbsp; jk jk...&nbsp; but if your interested you have to ask b/c i'm not putting it in here, lol...&nbsp; even though it's not a whole lotta...</P>

(so i love him) and then finally my mom called me at 7:45 and was like you didn't need to call me so much this is ridiculous i only left you there for a little while (but i was there for an hour and i was frozen like i couldn't move my hands or feet) so i hung up my phone on her, and told her to turn around and i'll just wait for my dad instead b/c i couldn't bare to see her...&nbsp; then my dad finally got there and i was crying b/c i knew when i got home i'd get in trouble and kyle wouldn't be allowed over tomorrow...&nbsp; and my dad was like i'll take care of everything and you can go take a shower and do your hw, and i was like, ty, ty, ty...&nbsp; so i go home, and my mom was like you are so ungrateful, blah, blah, blah...&nbsp; and the world doesn't revolve around you!&nbsp; So i was like, i'm going to take a shower since I'm an hour behind schedule...&nbsp; and i was like you aren't talking to me your yelling at me so i left and i was crying and screaming and hitting things and when i came up to take a shower my mo was like you don't need t take a shower every night, and i was like i have gym tomorrow and i need to shave, and she was like you shaved a week ago, and i was like yea...&nbsp;&nbsp; bhut unlike you i want my legs decent when i wear shorts, and then i said, unless you want me to follor ur examply and skip gym, so she got pissed and i walked away and haven't talked to her since... whew, that was a LONG story</P>

"event","<P>Saturday...&nbsp; humph...&nbsp; honestly...&nbsp;my mom must get joy out of yelling at me...&nbsp; she needs to know when to pick her battles...&nbsp; and then she needs to chill and realize i don't raise my voice unless she's not listening to me or she yells first...&nbsp; that's it, i won't start a conversation yelling...&nbsp; i just talk louder than she does and she SHOULD know that by now, I tell her this almost everyday, but ""i'm always yelling""&nbsp; but i'm not...&nbsp; what the fucking hell?!&nbsp; So now I stay in my room everyday, only going upstairs if it's a must...&nbsp; oh, anyways, saturday, i got yelled at b/c the hose wasn't working which meant somehow I did something wrong to break it... and since i couldn't fix it I almost got sno-ball taken away...&nbsp; if my mom even took a second to realize how retarded this all is she could relax a little bit.&nbsp; She's always complain how hard her days are...&nbsp; it's because she MAKES them hard...&nbsp; i want to beat her with a pan to knock some sense into her.&nbsp; I really don't know a single parent that yells this much at one child of there's...&nbsp; ESPECIALLY with how well behaved I'm am...&nbsp; and NO I'm not being conceited at all...&nbsp; I can definately say I am not a horrible teenager until they decide the world is my fault...&nbsp; I'm surprised my dad hasn't yelled at me yet because he lost his job... I'm assuming that's my fault too...&nbsp; Don't worry, I'll be grounded sooner or later because of it...&nbsp; Not to sound mean or anything, I would be upset if it happened...&nbsp; but I'd really like to see how my parents would act if they were seperated...&nbsp; seriously, it could make a huge difference, i don't want it to happen, but I just wonder how things would change in their attitudes...</P>
<P>ANYWAYS!&nbsp; That was entirely off topic...&nbsp; wooo....&nbsp; On Saturday I was having some really bad stomach problems and almost died until Karla's magical Ginger Ale and Thin Wheats came to save the day!&nbsp; Michele, me and Jes got all ready at the Ebrahimzadeh's house and then Mark came over for TONS of pictures... and thus making us an hour late to dinner...</P>
<P>(sorry...&nbsp; this little side note, my mom just came into my room and was complaining again...&nbsp; i can't even looking at her w/o getting upset, she's irritates me... my god, i need a LONG break from her, where we just don't talk or look at eachother, b/c i end up crying ever time we have a conversation... she's becoming worse than mr. brophy... i'd rather be in his class right now than talking to my mom...&nbsp; so now you can put into relation how awful it is getting here...)</P>
<P>Back to where I was...&nbsp; dinner was delicious... even though michele was scaring us about all the grams of fat in our food... ugh... and then afterwards we walked to get our phtots taken in a photo booth and everyone in the mall was making fun of us and laughing :(&nbsp; it's was humiliating, ugh, i wanted to cry!&nbsp; Then we got back...&nbsp; and it was 8 o'clock so we were totally ready to party!&nbsp; We met up w/ Ashley and the fun began, lol...&nbsp; idk, it would take me forever to tall you all the things that happened that i want to tell you, but one thing is I had a dancing accident and fell (in a dress mind you) and hurt my knee, lol...&nbsp; oh, and they played ""only the good die young"" which was so much fun :)</P>
<P>After sno ball michele and i went back to jes' with obviously jessica, and we were so sore and HUNGRY so we had some food, and then I went straight to sleep because I was so tired, who knows about the other two, lol...&nbsp; I woke up at quarter of 10...&nbsp; but of course jes and michele being the early birds they are were like up at 7... I don't know how they do it...&nbsp; lol... then ater being there for about an hour and eating breakfast my dad picked up me and michele and brought us home... the second i walk into my house the Bach's called for me to babysit and of course I agreed...&nbsp; so before i left i did SOME homework.... which I have to finish rather shortly if I want to use the phone... and then I went to babysit Ruby...&nbsp; She slept for half the time and then when she got up she was so cranky b/c i wasn't her mom or papa, so she kept throwing this horrible fit...&nbsp; but eventually she calmed down and then she was just running around for the rest of the night... AHHHH!!!!&nbsp; I ended up making 20 dollars, which is good, and then they asked me for two more times coming up, so more money for stephanie :)&nbsp; </P>
<P>Then I come home and the whole thing w/my mom, blah, blah, blah...&nbsp; anyways, that's it...&nbsp; here are my sno ball pictures :)&nbsp; ENJOY!</P>

"event","<P>well...&nbsp; do you want my good day or my bad day first...&nbsp; i'll give you my bad one, which was today...</P>
<P>well, everything was pretty good in skl, spanish was actually fun...&nbsp; band went by quickly but then i have this stupid ass thing in science and it is SO hard... and everyone was fooling around and like 2 ppl were actually paying attention, ugh, and i really needed to know the stuff b/c&nbsp;it's like half of the grade this quarter.</P>
<P>Lunch was fine...&nbsp; shaun kept rubbing around his chest...&nbsp; b/c he's weird... lol... then i called him gay, and attacked my poor feet which weren't well protected by my converses...&nbsp; but oh well, i promised him a kick in the balls for later...</P>
<P>Strangley enough my knee had been hurting all day, like when i need physical therapy, which wasn't kewl, so before gym i told my teacher about the whole thing and she said i should just try and all, which is nice...&nbsp; but eric kept giving me a hard time b/c i only did half the exercises on my right knee b/c it hurt to much to keep bending it, but screw him...&nbsp; haha, i got to do this awsome back extension thing and i got to hang upside down, So kewl... and then i did more ab exercises... i'm gonna be so BUFF!&nbsp; lol</P>
<P>After school, Michele came over and we had to search for a ride for like 15 minutes and when we finally gave up to go walk home we saw courtney's mom sitting in the car so we asked her for one and of course she said yes, lol... when we got home we went down in my room and michele was playing pacman and did a really good job and then we were taking REALLY weird pictures, lol.... and then being hyper while listening to music and trying to touch my ceiling with my head, lol... who knows :)&nbsp; ummmm, then we went upstairs and were watching clips and trailers for movies, lol.... we found the best movie... and we claimed it already.... the next big hit since ""the nightmare before christmas"" and better than ""willy wonka and the chocolate factory""....&nbsp; <FONT size=5><STRONG><U>Corpse's Bride</U></STRONG></FONT><FONT size=3> now just remember, we've already called it, lol...&nbsp; it is SO gonna rock... out on Septmeber, 2005!&nbsp; Our business is going to be open then and we will be selling t-shirts :)&nbsp; lol&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh man, did you know pacman was cheap?!&nbsp; lol...&nbsp; anyways, i got my report card, it's good, 3.9 GPA!&nbsp; (happily)&nbsp; UMMMM....&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P>Oh then for the bad of the day, GOSH!&nbsp; my mom was yelling at me to begin w/ b/c i asled for ashley to come over, but i didn't and i told her i didn't, and she yelled at me and was like yes you did, you asked when kyle was over, and i was like, nooo, i asked for michele to come over, i wouldn't ask for ashley to come over b/c i knew she was going to tim's... and then her plans changed but she was still going to nadia's!&nbsp; URG!&nbsp; (RUG!)&nbsp; </P>
<P>oh, and an update i don't want to go to the new york field trip in band... and my mom was like why not, and i was like i hate high schoolers... especially a lot of them in the band, ugh, she doesn't get it, she was like i know what you mean, and as she's always saying, times change, and the majority of the group in band is awful and i couldn't bear to deal with something like that the entire day...&nbsp; forget it, it's too confusing to even explain anymore...</P>
<P>then i've realized my mom doesn't trust me, there is no way!&nbsp; you know how parents always say, we will give you trust until you break it, well, i rarely break my parents trust, but i still don't get any....&nbsp; my mom doesn't believe me when i give her simple plans about me going to someones house, she has to call about everything i do, and it really upsets me...&nbsp; not because i can't go galavanting (sp) it's because my parents couldn't give a damn and don't care that i actually want them to believe what i say it, everyone in my house thinks i'm a dirty liar, and i don't lie!&nbsp; well atleast not purposely, or about anything major, i'm crying right now just thinking about it...&nbsp; i've never gone out drinking on my own or smoking pot, i just haven't....&nbsp; but since they have no such trust in me they believe i do it whenever i get a chance, or atleast it feels like it.... they make me feel like i'm the bad guy and do everything wrong and they are ashamed of me and can't believe a word i say, when i've never done anything to defy it...&nbsp; i've actually done a lot of things to prove that i listen and am a good person, but noooo.... i'm an evil senseless teenager who never tells the truth to her parents and could give a fuck....&nbsp; ya know what, maybe i should stoppping giving a fuck and do whatever i hell want, so then they know what it would be like to have a mis behaved teenager....&nbsp; not to seem egotistical (sp) but they should be happy with the way i act...&nbsp; i dress decently, i get great grades, do tons of chores every fucking day, do all my homework and don't participate in any drugs or drinking...&nbsp; but they won't ever realize it...&nbsp; i should start paying tommy to be bad, maybe they'll see it then...&nbsp; </P>
<P>oh, my good day was yesterday... kyle came over and we had fun, lol...&nbsp; that's about it...&nbsp; leave it....</P>"

"event","<P>I had a really weird dream, so I'm going to tell you all about it (if you are willing to read) in this journal entry....</P>
<P>I was with my regular family, and Ray, Donna, Faith, Vic and these two random starnge ladies.&nbsp; We were all watching a movie based on Super Mario and it was on every channel except one which had a poker game going.&nbsp; Then when it was over I went into my room where my mom and brother were sleeping to try to see if they had any good movies... but they didn't all they had was like Harry Potter in a different language.&nbsp; So I got dressed and set my bed up to go to sleep but then went out in the living room where everyone was.&nbsp; However, no one was there except Tommy, Shane, Ray and Faith.&nbsp; So we figured everyone was out, so we decided to go fishing in the back yard.&nbsp; Which I (in the dream) even thought was weird because we were standing on the dock and fishing into grass when we could have just turned around and fished in the lake.&nbsp; Oh well!&nbsp; Then an iguana came out and we were all stiff scared and tried running back into the house but there was a huge hill!&nbsp; Then the iguana started to bite Tommy so I called it a bad name and it began to attack me and we kept going back anf roth until Shane called him a name and then ran straight for the dock with me and Tommy.&nbsp; So Tommy and Shane go int the paddle boat and went away and the iguana just fell in the water.&nbsp; After a while of them being gone they came back and Shane has pierced ears and Tommy had eyeballs that were only white, messy hair, and a skin suite in because he was turned invisible and had to wear it like ""the hollow man"" so we knew where he was.&nbsp; Suddenly, I was sitting on my bed with Faith and we were watching all this through a t.v. and Faith turns to me and says, ""what is this?"" and I told her it's part of the extended version of Lord of the Rings 3...&nbsp; disc 3.&nbsp; Then we were back in the action, except now I was in this mansion hotel called ""Molten Roy"" *i think* and it was in a big city.&nbsp; Anyways, now Tommy was evil and always trying to set plots to either kill me or get me in trouble. (i always stopped him so i don't know which one it was)&nbsp; My mom thought he was a new child my dad had with another women, so she set me out to find her, and I brought a normal pillow and my body pillow with me... hmmmm!&nbsp; Then it got dark so I went to go home and random people kept asking me if I was crossing the street, and I was!&nbsp; Haha... when I got back to the hotel there was a huge party and Kyle and Justin were waiter there, lol.&nbsp; When I was telling Kyle about my brother I told him it was just a dream...&nbsp;&nbsp; but my gut feeling was that I was just too embarassed to tell him about it.&nbsp; Then I met up with Jes and the place looked like the kids section at Barnes and Noble and all our 6th grade friends from the were there...&nbsp; </P>
<P>Then I woke up....</P>
<P>P.S. Randomly throughtout the entire dream a picture of Ashley scared to death next to me ""deadly"" brother kept flashing in my mind!</P>
<P>P.P.S.&nbsp; Also, a guy who was trying to sell me ""Fat Albert"" mechandise and a ""Peanuts Gang"" inflattable chair was somewhere in my dream, but I don't remember where...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Last night I babysat for the neighbors and they owned this movie that I once saw and actualy thought it was a dream b/c no one had heard of it...&nbsp; so we totally watched it!&nbsp; And then I helped the little girl with her religious studies and washed my hair in their tub, haha....</P>
<P>Today was an A day, and therefore a good day, except for the spanish crap we have to do and the quiz next class, but oh well... Then I had band... boring and hungry!&nbsp; URG!&nbsp; So in science while 1st lunch wave was going on i texted ashley and told her to bring me food while i was in science class because i was starving and her and michele succeeded so I didn't die of complete hunger!</P>
<P>Lunch was kewl... there was a bit of action between shaun and keith...&nbsp; shaun got cheese in his face, and keith ended up w/ ketchup and chocolate on his hoodie, lol... that's ok....</P>
<P>gym was decent, i got to work out the abs and ticeps, and i had to do a lot of demenstrations, that didn't actually completely suck at!&nbsp; :)</P>

I think I'm finally not grounded, but I'm on probation, uck!&nbsp; I slept til ten today which was so nice, and when I woke up my throat was so clogged, blah!&nbsp; I definately need to have my ginormous tounsils taken out, except I'm afraid I will end up sounding like a man :( That would be terrible.&nbsp; Then Jes and I managed to find a way for her to come over w/o her havingn to walk in the snow... even though she is the extreme snow walker...&nbsp; Once she got here we stuck in Napolean Dynamite and watched it, and it was so awsome, and a lot easier to understand when you aren't in school with a whole butt load of people interupting the movie, urg!&nbsp; Anyways, after I got yelled at for not shoveling me and Jes went out in the snow and cleaned off my mom's car, which let me say is a very large challenge!&nbsp; Then once we finished with my mom's car we played, lol.... Of course we made beautiful snow angels and then we were hiding from our enemy the wind between the walls of snow around the side walk....&nbsp; After getting forzen there by our pants Jessica did this weird worm movement and kept smacking her head in the snow, lmao, it was too great!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Not only that, but then we were trying to be Legolas and walk on snow without falling through which totally didn't work and I ended up falling, with my legs kicking in the air and snow all over my face, lmfao...&nbsp; We are like little kids sometimes...&nbsp; Or REALLY immature teenagers...&nbsp; same thing :) Then Jessica went home and now I'm here, and hopefully Kyle will be home when I call because I would like to talk to him for just a LITTLE bit....&nbsp; lol...&nbsp; that's about it...&nbsp; love yaz!"

<P>saturday~ I hung out with my cousins and went to the mall w/ my cousin Faith... She was punching this boxing thingy in dicks and the whole thing like flew off across the gym area,&nbsp; it was so funny, i &lt;3 that store, lol... a.k.a. I &lt;3 dicks, lol... anyways... then we got home and we had like a belated christmas....&nbsp; which involved, ummm, a big dinner and then some presents, i got a watch, and i'm actually using it, lol... except i suck at tellin the time, haha... Then Faith and I went to Best Buy and I got My Chemical Romance and The F-Ups, which I have completely been dying for!&nbsp; lol....</P>
<P>sunday~ everyone left :(&nbsp; and they decided to take Shane w/ them for the week...&nbsp; Then Ashley and Michele called to hang out... so I went to the mall w/ Ashley which is always fun ;) and then went to Michele's house for the night... JACUZZI&nbsp; lol.... ya know i love you michele *mwah*&nbsp; </P>
<P>monday~ hung around Michele's house but then went home and talked to kelly for a little and then decided to go to her house b/c I hadn't seen her in quite a while... that's always fun b/c i love the girl!&nbsp; Then we went to the martin luther king thing and I got to see some of my ultimate middle skl buds!&nbsp; haha</P>
<P>tuesday~ back to skl, lol...&nbsp; Cindy got called an offy, it was SO funny, lol, long story!&nbsp; Not too much happened IN school on tuesday, but then when i got home this whole tantrum thingy happened and io got grounded for like... the rest of the week.&nbsp; WHATEVER!</P>
<P>wednesday~ Guess what, I found out I have gym class w/ Kyle, SO awsome!&nbsp; lol.... Then after skl I had&nbsp; CPAC meeting, and then I argued w/ my mom about HAVING to talk to her when I'm grounded, whatever!&nbsp; GOSH!&nbsp; lol... After that I did some hw, and stupid cleaning...&nbsp; BLAH!&nbsp; I had dance, I was SO lost b/c I haven't been there in like 5 weeks, and I don't really like my tap costumes... WAY too skimpy, uck!&nbsp; </P>
<P>thursday~ Haha, in s.s. me and ashley had a white out ""incident"" and it was TOO great, lol... <FONT size=4><EM>xylophone! </EM></FONT><FONT size=3>Then I had a math test and was shaking the whole time, lol, the effects of... cough drugs cough!&nbsp; haha, anywayz!&nbsp; Lunch w/ my lover wonderful as always!&nbsp; Then I got to hang out w/ Saba in mr. blade's class, and we basically just roamed the halls the entire time, always fun! Home was boring, like normal, and life as we know it wasn't on, wtf!</FONT></P>
<P>friday~ This is where my week gets better :)&nbsp; Let's see, well besides spanish first period, lol, which always sucks, i had science, which wasn't that bad at all, mr. fidelman was really cool, and then lunch w/ kyle ;)&nbsp; Shaun had a wonderful time putting a french fry down the back of my shirt, urg!&nbsp; lol...&nbsp; Then I had gym which was boring for a lot of the time and then we did ""pectoral"" excercises whish I am so week at... (or as michele calls them ""things that make your boobs stronger"")&nbsp; lol...&nbsp; After skl i talked to kyle on the phone for like an hour and then went to the mall w/ michele to get her a dress after a dispute w/ my mom BLAH! Kyle and Pat ended up being there ;)&nbsp; and we hung out w/ Kyle, lol... it was some fun, and my ice cream was really good!&nbsp; haha...&nbsp; ""we went downstairs in dicks""&nbsp; and michele called me fat, lol....&nbsp; yea, all so great :)&nbsp; Then right after the mall my mom dropped michele @ home and then we drove to new jersey...&nbsp; why i couldn't fall asleep in the car i do not know, but i was SO tired, and the 3 and a 1/2 hours in the car were tedious (sp)&nbsp; Finally we got there and I hung around w/ Faith as usual, and we watch Harold and Kumar go to white castle, lol, i love that movie!</P>
<P>saturday~ woke up at 8:30 even though it felt so much later, i just needed the sleep, and my arms were so sore from gym, uck!&nbsp; Then my tummy hurt b/c for the past couple of days my main diet was soda,... not too good :(&nbsp; Faith and I played DDR, which I sucked at for a little while but it was so funny.... then we had to pack up and go at 11 because we didn't want to get stuck in the snow storm :( this time I fell asleep in the car and slept like the entire time... lol...&nbsp; got home and my internet is finally working down in my room so i am online, which i shouldn't be because <EM>techinically</EM> I am still grounded, but everyone knows how good I am at that :)&nbsp; I'm gonna go now, though, so I'll ttyl, bye</P>"

"event","<P>I prolly won't get the chance to update through out the weekend because I have cousins coming over so I figured now would be the best time, on my lunch break. :)&nbsp; I'm eating some gritts, oooh I miss these things, I haven't had any in SO long!&nbsp; lol...&nbsp; Anyways, I got home from testing at... wait, let me start from the beginning...</P>
<P>First Tommy came down at 7 o'clock and was like you need to get up and I was like, SHIT, it's really late. but luckily I had what I was gonna wear out, so I went upstairs got halfway dressed and was brushing my teeth when I noticed my dad and Shane weren't up yet, while Tommy was sitting on the couch, so I was like Tommy a little more action please, can you go get everyone else?&nbsp; I guess my dad heard this because he came barging out of his bedroom, and was like, stop yelling at your brther, your the one running behind, and not dressed, but I was half dressed... anyways, I finished getting ready and I was like, urg this is gonna be a sour day, I'm gonna have to clean right after exams too...&nbsp; I was wrong...</P>
<P>Anyways, I got to school with about 1 minutes to spare amazingly.. and I gave Ashley her notebook she left over from when she was over yesterday, which may I add was a blast, and we watched Spice World!&nbsp; lol, anyways...&nbsp; Mr. Fidelman was late, but that's okay... but what I realize it that I so wish I had science first period everyday because it was such a nice way to start the day off...&nbsp; Like it was so much fun!&nbsp; Our written test thingy was SO unbelievably easy b/c he gave the same one to his PSP classes (not saying your stupid but we are used to harder things in honors) so it was such a relief, I will be mad if I got anything wrong.&nbsp; The next part was our lab, and he paired us up and when I got Arielle I was sort of sad, I don't know her very well and she doesn't seem... just I don't know, but she was really funny and I got flour all over me, but it was actually quite fun... even though we weren't supposed to talk we still did, and I was so discombobulated (&lt; I love that word) because I was tired and I kept calling peple by the wrong name, but it was funny. And Mr. Fidelman loved my south park pajama pants, he was like, ""Oh man, where did you get those"" and he wanted to know how much it would cost for me to give them to him...&nbsp; that sounds disturbing in a way, but ya know what he meant... lol, anyways... Chris slipped on marbles, like in the movies, I never thought that could happen, lol, but he's okay!&nbsp; Now here's the best part... I left class to go home at 9:35 (which I love) and Shaun was outside the classroom... with Kyle, so I knew something was up... even though supposedly Kyle wasn't gonna ask me out... and we walked to the end of the hall and we were just randomly talking, and then Kyle asked me out! :)&nbsp; Of course I said yes, and now I'm in the best mood, and hopefully I can stay mentally high like this for the rest of the day... doubt it, but I can pray, right?&nbsp; Yea, so after that Michele and I went to see Ashley in the cafeteria, and we hung for like 5 minutes and then we all said good by and they went to their next mid terms and I went home :)&nbsp; </P>
<P>Basically I've been cleaning since, but I'm still happy :)&nbsp; That's about all...&nbsp; call if ya wanna Mwah!&nbsp; </P>"

"event","<P>hmmmm.... mid terms... if i have as bad a sore throat as i did today tomorrow then i am otally screwed because i have spanish and if i can't talk i basically fail, ha, so hopefully it gets better, but it's worst in the morning and i have spanish first, damn it!&nbsp; Anyways... L.A. I think I did extremely well on the vocab and got a hundred on the reading terms, and i thought I did well on the essay, but w/ our teacher you honestly can never know, you always feel great about it but then you get your test back and you have a 70, hmmm....&nbsp; hopefully it's not like this time, for my grade's sake...&nbsp; S.S. simple as pie, the essay was a peice of cake but like he didn't give us enough time for the answers b/c everyone wasn't doen with the essay yet and we had like so little time for it, oh man, luckily i finished and i don't think i did half bad on it, should come out fairly well.... When people compare it drives me wild...&nbsp; not like i did better than you it's always i have it worse than you, wtf?!&nbsp; Honestly us teenagers have some mental problems b/c we always want to have it worse, b/c we want attention and sympathy, urg!&nbsp; </P>
<P>I'm not sure if I'm going to dance b/c I can't breathe which could cause bad things if I'm dancing and then going to babysit maniac freaks afterwards, man oh man this night should be interesting but hopefully I'll earn enough money to go get my hair cut and colored woo-hoo!&nbsp; Ugh, that's about all... tomorrow I have spanish and band... band i'm not worried about but I have some sweat dripping down my face just thinking about spanish, ugh, sends chills up my spine, the only part I'm going to do fine at is the writing but oh well, I have an A- in there which is totally hot!&nbsp; woo-hoo!&nbsp; I'll ttyl later... well possbily not if i'm incapable but ya know what i mean... bye!</P>"

"event","<P>Yeah...&nbsp; Today was, well, blah...&nbsp; First off, I was sick last night and my stomach hurt so much that I didn't fall asleep until 3:00 which lead to me sleeping until 12:00 today and now going to result in me staying up late again!&nbsp; Anyways, I've been sort of fuding with my mother again because I keep getting yelled at for taking breaks.&nbsp; Geez, it's a frickin weekend, it supposed to be a break!&nbsp; Then my mom's come backs are ""well I never get breaks!""&nbsp; Well, that's not my fault, she can take breaks...&nbsp; instead of yelling at me should could be taking a break!&nbsp; Well what I say to her, is I spent 2 hours cleaning my room and then another hour on homework, and i don't feel good, while tommy sits on his ass and plays video games all day, how is that in any way right?&nbsp; So then when I asked ot go to the movies with Ashley i got ANOTHER lecture but I dragged a yes out of her like I do everytime because I know my mom's weak spots.&nbsp; So my mom, tommy, shane and I went to go pick up Ashley.&nbsp; That's when my mom went inside to meet her mom and blah blah blah... finally we got to the movies and the show was packed.&nbsp; We ended up sitting in the second row and like there were only like 5 extra seats in the whole place!&nbsp; They showed more indepth scenes for the Ring Two which totally freaked me out.&nbsp; Oh man!&nbsp; Samara (sp) the little girl in the well crawls out (which looks totally disgusting) and then wants to become the little boy (that would tlak to her in the first movie) oh there were some freaky images...&nbsp; like her standing in the corner scraping the wall, ugh, sends chills up my spine.&nbsp; The this other movie, can't remember the name but it's based on a true story of how these people get killed in this house and then a family moves and it's really confusing...&nbsp; ANYWAYS!!!&nbsp; The movie we actually saw was white noise, and it was so weird.&nbsp; Like it was good but really confusing!&nbsp; Because you knew something was gonna happen but you honestly had no clue what... and the whole E.V.P. (look it up if you don't know about it... it's so interesting) is true, so it made the movie slightly true, in a way...&nbsp; Man, and it had a weird ending, not to mention all the parts something was gonna happen but when it did you would jump and scream, haha, but it was fun to watch it...&nbsp; well, that's about it, I might head down stairs but I am never gonna fall asleep...&nbsp; oh well... ttyl, bye!</P>
<P>P.S. Ewwww&nbsp; I got a bloody nose on the way home from the movies...</P>"

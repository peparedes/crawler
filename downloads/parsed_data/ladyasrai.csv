Me: Am I supossed to be filling this narcotic?
Pharmacist: Sure why not!
Me: oh
Pharmacist: Just dont take any, and if you do just dont let me see you!
Me: ...what the fuck just happened?

I couldnt believe it they had like vikes, perks, codines, and valiume just sitting out on the shelf. So illegl. Good thing pills arent my drug of choice, otherwise this might be a very interesting few weeks.

I made out like a bandit thats for sure. I got diamond earings, a gift certificate to get my hair done, a new outfit, roses, 35 granola bars, a phat cake, like 200 dollars, lots of lip products, a trip to Mohegan Sun and lobster for dinner. Oh and lots of free drinks! I am so bad...

Not much is new besides my age. I start school next week. Wow, I'm uber excited about that. Not really, but at least its my last year... Hope I meet lots of new cool people.

I saw Jason last night for the first time in a little while. I miss him. I dont know what I miss, the not calling, or the standing up, but I miss him.

I've been too sad latley. Jason and I are basicaly not anymore. Maybe it was my fault, maybe he's an asshole, maybe it just wasen't meant to be. I know we would have been happier longer if we just didnt have opposite schedules. The feeling was there and it was so strong! It got so frustrating though. And I know I have trust issues, reguardless if he put them there or not. Sometimes think he has a little growing to do too. Just getting out of a very long term relationship (and I do mean just) he did not go into this with a clear head. I'm sad right now and I really wish things could be different. He was the first guy I had gotten really excited over in years, really years. My hopes were too high, should have known better. Stupid girl!!

But my pitty party will be over soon (hopefully) and I will have the rest of the summer to focus on having the best time before school starts. As for now, give me chocolate, and a hug. asshole!

Speaking of high hopes, a good friend and i are working on a new project. Josh, I have a good feeling about this. ya'll like my icon?"

"event","Still feeling kind of crappy, pneumonia consumed my body and life. I cant wait until I'm feeling normal again, not weezey with a voice that sounds like i'm a 12 year old boy. Eating would be nice again too. Nothing tastes like anything and it all comes back up anyways. Skinny is nice but this is just irritating.

SO after a year and some change at Smokey Bones, its time to go one that never ending job hunt again. I didnt get fired or put in my two weeks just yet, but I desperatly need a new job. Last night, Saturday I made a whole $45. Yep... forty fuckin five bucks... off 7 tables. What am I gonna do with 45 bucks?? Slow isnt even the word for that place recently. And I now I have a heavy car payment and insurance bill every month. Plus the drama is just lame to me. Not to mention that I work 4 out of 5 shifts with an ex boyfriend type thing. In my book thats too much pressure for 45 bucks a night. School starts back up in a month, and as my last 'going back to school' year I would like it to go as smooth as possible. I dont want to be worrying about money on top of my 15 credits and field hours. So I'll probably make my rounds to Texas Roadhouse, Outback, Olive Garden, 99..places like that. I like waitressing, its doesnt involve much thinking and its the easiest way to make money in under 40 hours a week. Plus, ya'll know I'm a damn cutie

In other news, things are going awsome with Jason. He's just everything i could ever ask for in a guy. He's sweet, strong, funny, so sexy and really, really...smart.. I wish we could see eachother more, but that will all change between Aug and Sept. He gets his own place in Aug and we have 2 or 3 classes together this fall. I cant wait for school to start, get back in a set schedual.

"event","What a hella busy day. Well, not really actually, but it seems like a did alot. School was lame today. I am getting so sick of that class. For some reason it has a bunch of little 17-year-old duel enrollment kids. Oh my lord I want them all to choke on the bleach that they dip thier pretty heads in. All they talk about is drinking and fucking, at like 9 in the morning! I took the liberty of telling one girl who just turned 17 a week ago some of the terrible, terrible things she would get called if she kept bragging about her hard nipples. 
Then I went out to lunch at Ruby Tuesdays with Meaghan. I love salad bars!!!!!!! Sarah Caron waited on us, it was nice seeing an old face. Her little boy is so big!
Went for a hike up Peaked Mountain with Dave and Doug today. It was really nice to see them both. Doug seemed like he was enjoying life, and i'll kill him if he cuts his hair. Dave seemed like he was doing good as well. I'm happy for him. I'm happy for both of us. In one year we went from lovers to completely ploutonic friends. And its more comfortable than we have been around eachother in years. We've both aggreed that our relationship seems kind of like a dream we had a long, long time ago. Funny how life works out. I'm with the person that gives me butterflies, and I think about all the time. And he is with a very beautiful girl that is going to go the extra mile to be by his side. Thinking back, I couldnt be happier with the way things turned out. I wasent happy a year ago, neither was he. It wasen't the easiest thing in the world but here is open arms to falling in love with the person you want to be with. 

*i hope Jason is falling too*

He got a kitten yesterday! She's 6 weeks old and OMFG she is precious! He named her Pheobe, but we both say she will be called Slut eventually. I cant waiiiiiit till he gets his place on the first!!

I went to a sex toay party tonight. Ladies, listen to me you have to go to one of these things. It is the most awesomely hilarious thing you could do some afternoon. I myself spent $30... And its a great way to open up and be raunchy with your girlfriends. Hey like they say; everyone gotta feed the kitty! oh my...

Speaking of Jason we are doing really well actually. We've had a couple bumps in the road, but its all been a learning experience. Dating an older man is..quite different. I like it. I just think that he is the easiest person to love and be around that I've met in a very long time. Its hard for me to fall in love with somebody. I've only been in love once, so I really dont have much to compare this feeling to. But it feels right. I wanted him for so long that now everytime I kiss him it feel like my birthday! Last week he put money down on a nice apartment that we had looked at in Chicopee a little while back. We can move in August 1st. Though I'm not sure if I'm going to move in right away. I mean dating for 3 months and then moving in together is kind of a big jump. I mean it wouldnt be that bad, since he got promoted to Pharmacy Manager I wouldnt have to pay much at all. But still.. Maybe if we are still together after next semester i will hold my breathe and take the dive. We're excited to be together, but in no big hurry you know? I was beggining to worry that luck with men had run out... that I was going to have to settle. But not this time. Oh, and the sex....my goodness....

So not much is really new in my life, been going to school all summer, living at the gym (down to 105 and never looked better!), stopped smoking pot, working hard, partying harder. Life is good."

School is finally out for the semester! I did rather well this time around, pretty sure I made the deans list. though, I did have to withdrawl from one class.... (because I didnt do my homework)... I came out with all A's and B's in everything else. SO, now I'm done until my summer class starts on June 6th. Gee can't wait for that one!

Oh my god, I just opened my firdge and my dad made me mac and cheese!! shweeeet!

I will be moving again over memorial day weekend, to a trailer in Three Rivers. Yee-haw. Yeah definately still saving up for a place. Hopefully toward the end of the summer when I'm done with my rotations I will have the balls to be apply to be a hospital tech, not just a drug store cowgirl. If that all works out, I will have no more worries about affording a place and a better car!
 
A few weeks ago I started dating an amazing guy named Jason, or Jay. He's 23, gorgeous, knows how to have a good time, and just a well rounded nice guy. I've known him since last winter, but have just recently gotten the chacne to know him better. And so far, I really like what I know. I'm really hoping that eventually we will be together. I have a funny feeling we will be anyways. Tomorrow night we are going to the Go-Ten (any body ever been there?) with my best friend and her fiance. I cant wait its been such a long weekend and I need some saki with a side of love =)

what am i talking about?
Alright, we have a nice townhouse style apartment in Palmer, its right off the mass pike exit, all new carpets and appliences, two stories, and the price is right. Over all its just a nice, quiet place. Much improvement over where we used to live in Ware... So here is my issue; he is giving this all up for a 27 year old Three Rivers trailer that some bitch died in last fall!!!! Now, nothing against trailer parks, I myself lived in one at one point in my life. But because of that I can say I know for sure that it sucks! They are ovens in the summer time, ice boxes in the winter time, you have no yard, and no matter whrere you go you are surrounded by alcoholics!! Man, I'm sorry, but I just can't live in a Three Rivers trailer park and be happy.... Not knowing that I could be happier somewhere else. I'm so bummed out right now, I love this apartment and there was so much I was going to do with it this summer when I had the time. I even bought wall paper already, and the palm tree I put in the living room catches the sun every morning.

I'm a clean, attractive female who makes decent money, and is completly independent.... anybody looking for a roomie??

I hate to have to ask that, but my mother's house is not an option and I'm all set with an old ass trailer in the Polish Capitol of New England =)

Well first off, i moved to an apartment in Palmer. Suck my ass Ware. NO more crazy people above me!! No more anybody above me anymore! I love it here, its a cute place, two stories with enough room for two people to live comfortably. if anybody wants to see it and hang out, just drop by..
My life has been pretty busy, 15 credits and a friday-monday job dont really leave time for much. But I'm having a balst! I've met and grown close to some of the weirdest, coolest people in western ma. Luckily, between school and work lots of new social doors have been opened. I started seeing someone new recently. I'm skeptical, but i figured it would be healthy. but he's cool kid =) we're going to a Jack & Jill on saturday. It should be tons of fun; nice date, open bar, loud music, all my best girls, and spike heels here i come!

I wish i could write more, but its time for this chick to take a nap (I have a cold, bleh) and then its homework time! ooohhh yeah!!

to everyone i havent seen in a while: i miss you! 413.237.4554"

Look out 283 here i come! new place should be rockin, i know its not that big or anything but at least there will be nobody upstairs!! i'm finally going to get decent sleep and not be woken up in the middle of the night by obnoxious psychopaths. Oh and its right by the entrance to the pike so it will only take me like 20 minutes to get to school, yyeeeeaahh!!! ah 20 minutes to school, 15-20 minutes to work.. suck my box ware massachusetts!! oh my..

anywho, life has been kinda crappy, drama on top of stupid drama. I dont even understand half of it either. I wish everything could just be cool again, real again. I wish that everybody could just relax again, play scrabble and be safe again. But then again i wish for alot of things. I wish I could do better, be better, speak up more, lose 10 pounds and prove my mirror wrong, break my mirror. I wish I had more time, more patience, more identity, less struggle, be comfortable and stop. I wish I did better in school, could stop falling asleep, felt good, didn't break my capsule stick in lab. Wow thats alot of wishes, too bad wishes are just elaborate dreams.
 
I need to shower, work in 2 hours. that come with two sides of your choice and garlic toast. i'd rather fade away instead."

well 1144 days after chicken fingers and ice cream Dave and I have broken up. It happened on the 4th but i havent wanted to write about it till now. i'm still not quite sure what to say. it began as something that i had initiated, but in the end it turned out mutual. i have far toooo busy of a schedule to have a relationship and feel it fair, and he need space. well i gues we both needed space, and growth. but its not like i broke up with him to go fuck some other guy or anything so i guess it all turned out alright. so far we are both taking it as good as possible. we are to still remain friends, he is my best friend and will if at all possible still hang out. i guess 2005 really is a year for change. i dont feel like saying anymore.

I just got back from the er a little while ago. i've got some hardcore strep throat action going on. the doc guy said it was the worst case he had seen all week and mummbled something about my throat looking like chicken parm... hhm maybe he was just hungry.mmwwahh hungry for 19 year old bacteria ridden throat!! fuckin weird. i was so happy i looked at the script and actually knew what 'cap I po tid x 10' meant!!! take one caspsule three times per day after meals for 10 days. shweet. so i'm outta work for two days and i might not (but prolly will) go to skewl tmw if i feel real crappy.

So, whats new? Not a whole lot.. maybe thats why I haven't updated. yeah probably. in fact I still don't have much to say. i'm starting school back up on monday and i must admit i'm happy about it. I'm really hoping to make some changes about myself in the next few months. First change, stop smoking so much. I need to step out of the clouds for a while. I want to be smarter, more aware, and most of all, more motivated. There is a hanfull of things i have been meaning to get to for months now. So maybe now i will one of these days. Second, study harder. I did alright last semester, but i could do better. i really don't wanna dissapoint my dad. Plus i love what i'm doing, so if i just focus i should do fine. Good luck to anyone else starting this week! Hang in there... And my last change, be healthier all over, no more weird ass diets that only exsist in my own little world.

Thr fucktards upstairs were raising hell until 3:30 this morning...or at least thats when i left. So I threw some pants on and drove like a mad women to his house. He made me feel better with lots of love, a nice massage, and 7 hours of solid sleep. He was a godsend really!
I just talked to my dad at work. Apparenly when he got up at 5:30 for work they were still up running around and talking to their cats. Whats a good household chemical that I could use to poison a bunch of nasty kitties?? Bleach? Ajax? Amonia? Scrubbing bubbles? Naw, I'm just kidding...or am I? Anywho, my pop is gonna talk to the landlord again today. And you know what the means?? One more noise violation and they are out!!
Know what it is right now? A reasonaby day time hour. So I'm going to blair loud, offensive music because they are probably trying to sleep. Fuckers.
Alright enough about that...
New years was fucking awesome! I got more trashed than I had in years and I believe it was Bill that gave me drunk of the night award! Thanks for a great night everyone! Yay for burning christmas trees. What a flame..
Gotta work tonight... don't really wanna go, not feeling too good, but I will anyways. Can't really complain too much though, I've been bringing home like $100 or more every shift I've had since the week before christmas. Its a good time for restaurants... But after this blows over I'm getting a new job. I'm semi qualified to work in a pharmacy right now. I did better than I though this semester, came out with one A+, one B, and one C+. Works for me. If I got a job now I could start at like 8 an hour working on the cash register, and learning the computer system. And after next semester when I take my institutional lab I will be qualified to work at a hospital pharmacy actaully filling scripts and learning how to compound. After I fill my credit hours (235 at hospital pharm and 235 at a store pharm) I will probably be making like 15 an hour. Thats still like a year away though. I know I'm not going to graduate on time, but thats my choice I don't want to. Graduating on time would mean going to school 4 or 5 classes for the next 3 semesters, two classes over the summer and one next winter break. If I wanted to go to school like that, I would have went away to college. As for now I'm just going to take it a few classes at a time, and keep having a life and working like 25 hours a week in my agenda. So what if I take 3 years from start to graduate? I'm sure there will still be sick people out there, and i need to enjoy this time in my life =)
Well, I'm going to continue to blast loud, offensive music (internet radio is the shit) and go take a long, hot shower.

I had an awesome day today with the ladies =) we went out to eat at the 99 and then literally shopped till we dropped. For only $50 today I got lunch, 2 gifts for my sweetie, this really nice glass canaster filled with tea for my dad, a cute (kinda) mug with candy for my mom, 2 gifts for my grandmother, some candy for work tmw, a pair of jeans and 3 pairs of sexy undies for me. I'd say I was a pro at this whole smart shopper thing!
 *happy dance* I had my last final today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So this makes tonight the first night of my break! And just to think, in one month I get to go back and do it all over again. Oh well, I really can't complain. I enjoy school for the most part. I had a really great instructor this semester, and I can honestly say that it made me sad today when I gave him my test and walked out of PHM 100 forever. I really hope that I get a chance to have him again. So one down three to go....
I'm actually quite excited about the upcoming holiday. I think this is the first year that I can afford to get people some decent gifts. Christmas is gonna be cool, wake up and exchange gifts with dad, go exchange shit with my mom and then go let Dave and I spoil eachother! It should be fun times...

I had to miss my first two classes today thanks to some weird ass little bug that seems to have comfortably infested itself into my body. I feel like crap, even after sleeping for almost 12 hours. I must say though, Tylenol Cold and Sinus is the shit!!! Put me out like a light last night!

So what else is new? Lets see, I had a horrible weekend, making less than $200 in 3 days. Had to close sunday night because rather than schedul any night people, they just had 9 doubles come in. So in english that means I have been comiing in at 12 on sundays and working till 11:30 at night with no break *cough* illegal. And I can't even begin to explain how much working 11 1/2 hours with no break, making $80 sucks. I got stuck with the rat pack this weekend too. Took care of their asses for 7 1/2 hours for a $0.90 tip!! Fuckin assholes! I've been working on a letter to my boss about it, because it really is making it a difficult place to work. I love the job but if they are going to continue having a trained monkey do the schedul, than this chick is going to the Olive Garden!
And because I spent all weekend there, I didn't even get to see Dave till last night.... and alls i wanted to do last night was cough and sleep. sorry hun. well, I guess that I should go get dressed and get to my last class."

"event","<i>Sitting in the hotel room while Rogue took a shower, Jubilee sighed and turned in her bed. She must've listened to the voicemail from Haylie at least five times today. The government took Johnny. Sure she didn't know him well, but he'd offered to help find Haylie and he fought to protect them when the military invaded the school. That meant something to her.

They took him for trying to help her. Jubilee hated the plan of hiding on the boat with the others, but Haylie ordered her to stick to the plan so she would. It didn't mean she had to like it.

""Johnny, hold on a little longer. We'll get you out, I promise."" She whispered and closed her eyes, fighting sleep.</i>"

"event","<i>Jubilee checked her voicemail in the car while Rogue drove. They were somewhere in Northern Vermont, skirting around New York like Haylie had ordered. Jubilee was pissed. Well, pissed was an understatement. Torch had been kidnapped by the military and she could tell by Haylie's voice that she was frantic.

She wanted to go bust his ass out, but she remembered Haylie's order and sunk down in her seat, grumbling to herself.</i>"

"event","<i>Jubilee wandered back into the cabin after explaining to the wolves where she'd been and waving off their growls as a ""pups aren't supposed to run off alone like that"" lecture. She looked down at Haylie, who was sitting up in hers and Michael's sleeping bag and staring off numbly.

""Spitshine?"" She asked quietly, heart breaking at how pale she looked. ""Haylie?"" No response. Jubilee sighed heavily and crawled into her sleeping bag next to Rogue, blinking back tears as she watched Haylie until she finally fell asleep.</i>"

"event","<i>Was Jubilee the only one who gave a damn? Who realized this wasn't right? She knew Michael felt the way she did but he was too tired to fight it anymore. She could argue it til she died. And she would. It seemed to get through to Haylie.

She woke up, sitting up and looking over at Haylie and the woman she kept calling ""Chloe"" and watched Hope get ready to zap Haylie. ""Stop it! God damnit you're not helpin' things that way! Ya think she's ever gonna wanna trust us? Stop hurting Haylie! You've done enough damage!"" She screamed at Hope, tears in her eyes as she got to her feet and took off, going outside into the forest to clear her head and get away from the people that were making her sick.

Logan was dedicated completely to his wife now, and to Jubilee that meant she should start looking for a new father-figure. She understood how much he loved Hope and she was happy for them, but the fact that she couldn't speak out at Hope once without Logan yelling at her bothered her. Her Wolvie betrayed her, her Haylie betrayed them all, her home was practically in ruin, and Michael was in pieces. She wanted to run away, back to New York. Katelyn needed to know.

There was only one person she could turn to for help now. It wasn't in his nature to waste time with girls he couldn't flirt with but he'd helped her at the Institute the night before. That showed her he had a heart. She cursed and resisted the urge to use her cell phone as a firework when it showed no service. So she stalked back inside, ignoring everyone as she grumbled about not having a damn phone. She grabbed her coat and headed outside and began to walk. She didn't care if it took forever, she was going to find a town and a phone. She was gonna call her new ""friend"" and see if he'd come get her.</i>"

"event","<i>Waiting was not something Jubilee was good at. Snapping her gum, hands stuffed in her pockets, Jubilee went into the library to cool off. Jubilee's grades had been down over the year and Haylie urged her to read some more books so she thought she might as well try. Jubilee browsed the History and Science sections, bored until she came across a book on aerodynamics.

She picked up the book and sat on the counter, perusing it casually. She wasn't sure if anyone else was around but she didn't care.</i>"

"event","<i>Storming around the Institute, Jubilee knocked on Haylie's door before peering inside. Empty. No trace of her or Michael. And Logan was nowhere to be found. ""Oh you gotta be kidding me! Son of a bitch!"" Closing the door Jubilee ran down the hall towards the dormitories looking around.

""Ey, where's Prof Snyder and Logan?"" She asked Siryn and Sunspot as she skidded to a halt.

They exchanged glances before Siryn said, ""I don't know. Mr. Chandler and Professor Logan took off earlier the other day though. They looked pretty upset.""

""Try Dr. Chandler, she probably knows."" Sunspot shrugged and went back to juggling.

Jubilee threw her hands up and took off for Hope's office, throwing in a new piece of gum and snapping it wildly.</i>"

"event","Man so far my first few things have been set into motion. I spent about 270$ this weekend so far on things like clothes, and other things to prepare for the coming days. I have been having a lot of fun. I just got back from helping my friend mark move into his new house. It is pretty nice, however i know i am going to be sore as a bitch in the morning because i lifted a lot of the heavy crap by myself. I did so to make the move quicker. It took about 2 hours to load the stuff when half of it was already in there when i got to his house. it only took 45 minutes to unload it. I had fun and had a great time hanging out with peeps. 

Tomorrow. that will be a fun day. Mark is coming over and probably Ylon. More than likely we will play eternal sonata and have good fun. Then i go do my usual thing going up to boomerangs for a good ol time with karaoke and such. Then it will be time to drudge through another week before halloween weekend. That will be the fun times there. Also i found out a bunch of new info on my wife that she probably doesn't want me to know. I'll just say i have made good friendships with the people who she is living with and they didn't have a good report on her. 

Well until next time, keep your spirits up and know that no matter what comes your way, you can pull through, if not, let me know and ill help you out."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long has it been since i have made an entry. Man i am sorry to neglect you LJ, i have just been having too much fun. Let's get this party going.

In the time since my last update i have done a ton of shit. I have become the new marsha to a group of friends. I have gone out way too much, i have gotten drunk for the first time, I rediscovered old memories, I rebuilt some old bridges and found some new ones, Supernatural season 3 started and it is already looking badass, and i have lost about 10 pounds. A lot to take in eh? That is not all, i have also given two more speeches in toastmasters, found a way to work out at work, and have gotten in good with my supervisor. That is not all, i have been found at work for my artistic abilities and now have been volunteered to do the decorations for our desks halloween event.

Whew, talk about an exhausting adventure no? Well it is not over, not by a long shot, i have many events coming up including this weekend and next week. However next weeks project is top secret and only a few know the details. On top of that i am also going out on the 30th and the 31st for halloween events. OMG tell me more marshall!!!!! Well on top of that i am freed for vacation the whole week of thanksgiving and my last day of work for the year is Dec 22nd. I spent the rest of my vacation time since i can't carry it over. What can i say i am having a crap load of fun and there is nothing holding me back.

Well sorry for the neglect LJ, thought i'd make it up to ya with this post."

"event","Well my birthday has come and gone, and with it was a horrible one. Nothing went right the entire day including work. Today however was different, we held a potluck at work today and everyone was cutting up including our supervisor. I spent some time with a friend after work then got home a played a game with my brother. 

It's hard to be optimistic lately. A lot of things just don't seem to be fitting into place and has started to wear on my resolve. I just look at too many things in certain ways. It doesn't help that i have the way the i feel yet i know i should not try to persue that path. Is happiness going to hide from me forever. I do have a good time and i do go out, however they don't truly make me happy. I have a lot of time to dedicate, however i am no longer interested in dedicating it to what i used to which was video games. Nor have i the desire to spend it alone. 

I guess if i am afraid of anything, it is being alone. I try to go out with friends, and i do have some people i am interested in. Maybe it is because i haven't been out there to actually start something, or i am just too afraid, afraid that i will get hurt again. I try subtle things, but then again i maybe fooling myself."

"event","Well it sure has been a while eh LJ? Of course to all of you who might read my entries as well. I have been, to say the least on the outside feeling good. Yet i have a never ending turmoil going on inside of me. It's one thing that i am constantly bugged by and that is being alone the rest of my life. I have made some mistakes, and because of those mistakes i have lost a very good thing. I have been enjoying my so called freedom. I have gotten out of the house more in the last month and a half than i have in the last 3 years. Yet, i know how i should be. How i should be to someone else. I am still tormented when i see a happy couple. I become slightly envious. The thing is it is really hard to show someone how you feel when you don't know how they will react to it.

I know some of the older folk will say that i am young and that maybe i should wait or some nonsense like that. The thing is, is that even at 23 almost 24 i already know what i want out of a relationship. I already know what it takes to make a good relationship and make it last. I have a friend who is 55 years old. He is married to a wonderful woman. I see him and his wife, how they interact and work within one another that makes their relationship seem so real. They treat me like a son and i feel great when i am in their presence. My friend has also been a great mentor to me. Has helped me see a lot of things in life and believes in me. 

I just don't want to be alone. I have my girls and i love them to death, but they cannot receive the kind of affection i want to give. 

Well enough of my going on's, until next time.. &nbsp;"

"event","Well almost a week since an entry so i felt i should update. I have updated my Myspace but i have many more friends through myspace and usually use LJ as a way of updating the only friend i have on LJ of whats been going on with me. 

Well as i have stated i am going to recap my weekend past. Friday was pretty uneventful, i spent time with my kids which i enjoy. Saturday i did some workouts for 2 hours, then washed my car and cleaned it out. I chilled for a little while until Sam asked me if i had any plans that night. We ended up going out to peabodys with her friend Roddena and Brandon. Sad part was Brandon couldn't get past the screeners because he had too baggy pants which was bullshit in the first place. So Sam stayed out with him and walked the boardwalk while me and Roddena went inside. It was fun for a bit, i danced a little out on the floor and walked around. Sam is trying to use it as a way of me getting out more and showing myself to the market. 

I appreciate what she is trying to do and all. Club people just don't seem like my type. Went to bed to prepare for Sunday around 1:30. Sunday i got up, fed the kids and started preparing to go over to Pat's house. I was the first there and the last to leave, but Pat and his wife treat me like family and i feel like an adopted son. They held a social Toastmasters meeting there where i gave my first speech. I got a lot of praise for someone giving his first speech. It made me feel pretty good inside. Spent the rest of the day talking about my life with the other toastmaster members, which was pretty amazing because of the people i have seen give their first speech, none of the other toastmasters spoke with them afterwards about their life

I would have to accredit my martial arts training for the reason why i presented my speech the way that i did. The first speech is titled your icebreaker in which you give a 4-6 minute speech about yourself in a manner of letting everyone else know a little about you. It was all fun Sunday and i felt i got to know some others a little bit more. 

Today was a great day. I woke up happy, fed the girls, did a little workout and thought about the day for a little while. I called Marsha for a little bit and got into a scuffle with her. I fixed that up quick cause i didn't want it to ruin my day. Then i went over to Amanda's place to pick her up for lunch. Got a little lost in where she lives exactly, but i had a good time with it. Took her out to eat at Tropical smoothie cafe. We get there and order our food. We ate and talked for a bit and i took her back home. 

I think that was the highlight of my weekend. Not only did i enjoy lunch, but i enjoyed it with good company and it was her birthday so it felt better to me by taking her out to lunch. I think i'll stop for now, there are a couple of things on my mind that i have to look at before words come to mind. I would rather not say them wrong. 

Until next time."

I had a co-worker today say Heeeeeeessssss baaaaacccckkkkk!!!! Which means that i am getting back to my wacky self before this drama started. 

Starting to get tired of the runarounds though. Also not having money. It all stinks horribly. Been a bit more talkative as of late as well. Making plans, and helping others out. As a matter of fact this weekend will be great filled with a lot of action. Labor day weekend means 3 days of work free fun and it is payday hehehehe.

I also took the time to update and pimp my Livejournal. Took a while cause a lot of their things are quite ugly.

Well talk to you next time"

"event","Well since my last induced amount of lost syndrome, i have found myself a little better. Slowly yet surely i am not missing her. I have found myself to be better off when i put a little more thought into it. Especially after talking with a good friend i have come to realize again that change is a constant thing and is the only thing that is constant. As she has changed, so must I. In that respect i think that letting her go is best for me and will let me be at peace. 

The hardest thing now is looking ahead. How am i going to proceed now with my past behind me. Is life going to screw me again, if ever given the chance. To be 23 and knowing what i know now. It's hard to believe that there is someone out there for me. Maybe it is but a fantasy that mocks me and torments me. 

Try as it may, i will see what comes up and move on from that too. Even if it means i remain single."

"event","Today my wife and I have officially started our separation and tonight is the first night i sleep in the bed without her. I might have gone on about how i am waiting to move on and ready to do it. However once you reach the point where it starts, that is when the pain finally hits you, and hits you hard like a train. After hanging out with my friend like i usually do on sundays, i started driving back home. The place where marsha is staying is on the way home so i called and asked to come by and visit since i was gone all day when she was finishing the move. 

I am a mess. I cried at least 4 times while there with her, once in the car, and then once when i got home. Not too many people might be proud of admitting that they cried. The pain is almost unbearable. To know that i tried so hard for someone i believed so much in and still this separation go through. The fact that i will sleep in an empty bed from now on. It is easy to say you can move on while they are still with you. It's the time when it comes to pass that hurts the worst. There is no preparation, no way to be ready for when it hits you. Every aspect of me that will only see her every now and again and even then that she may have someone else in her life. I am beside myself in how i feel.

Sorry but i cannot write anymore, it hurts even now."

"event","Wow been a while since i made an entry eh? Well things have been decent around the ranch. Marsha leaves the house this weekend which will officially kick off our separation. We are going to have a big talk about what will go on and such especially when it comes to the kids.

Speaking of my subject line, it has been a while since i have dated. Although to go on a date you tend to need someone to go on a date with. Anyways who knows what will happen. Maybe i'll find someone for me out there. Who knows, i haven't seen the light of having to meet others for over 5 years..... Thing is i feel pretty good about going back into bachelordom, the single life. It hasn't been so bad despite the fact that i wanna spend time with someone special to me. 

For the most part i have been working out the finer details especially when it comes to money... there never seems to be enough. Then when you think there is, something comes to take it away. 

Friends are great. I'm finding more and more everyday, that or mine for my current friends grows stronger everyday. I think back to a few years when one of my closest friend was one i only met online in a game. However something inside me burst out with new life and i have spoken with a lot more people lately. I am hoping that one day i can meet a good friend (Female) and start to develop something. Then again that is only hoping... Not that it would ever come true.

Anyways thanks for reading, until next time."

"event","I don't know what it is exactly. A new blend of feelings that i haven't felt since i was 18. A little bit around 6 years ago. The feelng i have of being able to just do what i liked, and if something came along being able to go with it. Something like that is coming upon me. Not necesarily in the same way as i mentioned, but something a little similar.&nbsp; I've taken a lot into account with what i hear a lot lately especially when it comes to friends. I can't really contain it. There is so much i want to do, so much i want to help out with.&nbsp;

I guess you could attribute it to the fact that all of my life i was raised by certain morals. Not just by my parents, but by general morals i believe to be right since i was younger. I've always been the one to believe that just knowing that you have done a good deed is reward enough. It is the fuel that feeds me to help even more. Even if you have to, help your enemies. Of all the things i have experienced in my near 24 years, I have taken into accord many perspectives that have opened me up to worlds unknown.&nbsp;

I think it is pretty bad that i think of others as younger people even if they are 2-4 years younger than me. Maybe it is that i have taken onto myself a role of sorts to assist others or even mentor them when it comes to life matters.&nbsp;

There is one experience that i am missing. Love, a deep and burning love. Weird huh? Hearing that from someone who has yet to even live a fourth of his life. In the core of most people i believe is that desire. However inside of me it burns like white fire. Wild and passionate, yet cool to the touch.&nbsp;

Call me romantic, or maybe foolish, but i can't help but feel or think about everything else when i see a couple together, holding hands, hugging, kissing, or fooling around.&nbsp;

Thanks for reading, until next time."

"event","After a turbulant 2 months, everything has finally settled down. Me and my wife have come to terms. We both now talk to each other regularly about things. We are now prepared mentally to move on with our lives. Of all things I am now ready to move into something new. How long it takes to get into something new is my uncertainty. I am though ready to move on and take that next step with a brand new wisdom, a brand new dedication ready to be used.&nbsp;

Work has slightly gotten better as well. I have been working on a lot of things lately, not only getting my time with my wife straighted out, but my finances too. I am on the right path now and am going down it straight as an arrow.&nbsp;

I was outside talking with my wife last night around 10PM when my dad took the time to come outside and join us. My father was not informed of anything going on between me and marsha. This was mainly due to the fact that me and marsha were at ends throughout the 2 months this was happening. I did not want to tell my father anything when the next day it would be nothing but water under the bridge. Fortunately me and marsha have worked out our differences and were able to say what we truely felt.&nbsp;He has been hounding me about things with her and had nothing but bad things to say about her and her actions within the house. Of course he started attacking her with what she has done lately. The thing was he didn't know the story. I eventually got tired of him attacking her and i put my foot down. I told my dad what me and marsha have been through, what is happening, what is to come. I asked him my last favor as his son, that was to simply let this end without interfering.

With that i am feeling a whole lot better about the situation now. I have gotten my parents off of my wifes back. I have proven to marsha that i am standing by her even if we aren't going to be together. I have just felt a lot better. I have been wanting to let my parents know what was going on, but marsha didn't want me to, that and i felt that it just wasn't time yet. Now that it is come and gone, me and her can focus on finding our respective ways out.&nbsp;

I have been busy the last few days and haven't been able to get ahold of my possible roommate. Which isn't too bad since she just got back from a week in florida. Today will be a sit and relax day for me so i'm gonna take the time to get ahold of some good friends.

Until next time."

A little upset, wednesdays i go and hang out with my mentor in life and shoot the shit for a while about work, relationships and other shit. I can understand though, he is part of Toastmasters, the former District manager for the district his club is in, her ex had a stroke and he went over to her house tonight. So i am looking for crap to do to finish out the day.

I've gotten back into reading. I picked up a John Saul book called In the Dark of the Night. It is a fascinating book and John Saul is the kind of writer i can enjoy reading.&nbsp; 

On another front my wife finally got her car from her uncle and i am now free and unbound by her in the morning and she will stop burning my gas to go out to areas that require a quarter of a tank to get to and back. So now that she has it i have been quite happy. 

The future looks hopeful. Plans are being made that i hope can come to fruition and i can finally relax. 

Well until next time."

"event","Well not too much to report on the battlefront. The weekend wasn't very eventful. I hung out with a good buddy most of saturday though most of it was playing a game. It was fun for the most part. Today i was supposed to visit a friend, but i nixed that to spend time with my wife and kids. As usual on sunday evenings i went up to boomerangs to throw darts and hang out. It too wasn't that eventful either. 

What i need is some adventure or something. I don't know maybe just some chill time somewhere. Maybe alone or with a good friend. Too much of a lapse has occured. I got into another spiff with my wife today. Both of us want out of this marriage as fast as possible. However that would mean destruction to us both. My feelings may collapse here shortly..... I honestly don't know how much longer i can take before my soul snaps and cries out for someone. I watch other couples being happy with each other and think to myself... I want to be that guy, not exactly that person per say, but just in that kind of position. My spiritual knees are buckling and may give way. 

Anyways. Other than spilling out what my souls cries for that my morals deny i think ill write again later. Until then..."

"event","Aye another entry on the same day. However i felt the need to enter this.

Well tonight i went to an old high school friends workplace. It was a great experience. Getting to talk with my good high school friends is nice. Also it is great to speak with others who have gone through similar situations. It is a lot easier to talk about it as well as get some sort of healing out of it. There is also a chance i might be able to get out of my parents house, and it couldn't have come at a better time.
 
 There is a possibility that i will be a roommate with my friend and get out of here, there are too many painful memories with my parents and their house. However it is quite shocking to learn that she could trust me after just getting to know me after the years we haven't talked. Not to say i am not trustworthy in the least because after my recent transformation, i feel like a new person who has learned from his mistakes and honestly have grown up quite a bit in such a short time. 
 
 I actually left happy and once again i am able to look at life with some hope. For the most part i am flattered that i was asked, and she also needs some help and for any friend i will do anything and whatever i can. 
 
 As much as i say i am happy to move on to getting our divorce and all, i still care for my wife and love her. Tonight when i got home, as usual the kids are not in bed. It is not entirely her fault, throughout our marriage she has been undermined by my parents when it comes to the kids. She was punishing our youngest because they wouldn't goto bed and was trying to separate them. I told the youngest to get on our bed and goto sleep away from her sister and she got angry. 
 
 She was upset becasuse she felt i was undermining her as a parent as she wanted cassie to be in her own bed instead of ours. I told her that i didn't care if i undermined her and that i wanted them to goto sleep. She stormed off. Well, after realizing what i did and what i told myself i wouldn't do, i made cassie lay in her bed, although with much resistance. I realized i did the same thing my parents did. I undermined her and then told her off. 
 
 I care about my kids and usually have them in bed around 8:30. It was 9:30 at the time. I told her that if she didn't care, then to just drop them in the divorce. Another mistake i made in telling her that. Later i sat down with her and had a talk with her. I admitted my mistake and everything. That she should be strong for the kids and that both of us are their parents. That we need to support each other to support the kids. She went to bed shortly after. 
 
 Well there you have it. 2 hours of an emotionally charged night."

Thanks to some life altercating events i have seen the kind of person i need to be and the kind i don't. A lot of things i think about are either happy or painful. For the most part&nbsp;i try to look at what can make me happy.&nbsp;

Writing this from work right now. Its stupid slow right now with about 20+ minute inbetween calls that i take. Don't know how long it will last though as it is tuesday. That said it shouldn't be that bad as only 45 people are receiving tablets today compared to the usual 200+.&nbsp;

I have been spending a lot of time lately with friends. One of the great things i dearly missed over the last few years and part of my making myself better plan, something in which i plan to keep intact. My co-workers are kinda crazy right now. When it is really slow, usually its a gathering of chatting and such and the silly things flow. It helps kill the time on slow days outside of surfing the net."

"event","Well here is my first LJ entry. Of all things i have been through hell and back and can say that i learned a lot from it.

I am going through a divorce which is quite painful. Though after going through the motions for 2 months now i can say that i a look forward to it. My wife has completely changed now into something i no longer care for. She is either cold to me or we can both talk and laugh and such. All of this ""either or"" is upsetting me.

If anyone cares to know i used to be neglectful to my wife and my kids. After on fateful evening i was forever changed. Now i am a more open person no longer bound by video games which held onto me and my attention for so long. 

Now all i want is someone, someone in my life who can mean the world to me and someone i can be with. Most importantly i would like someone who can return those feelings to me as well. On top of that i have my kids to care for. I am quite a mess of emotion and problems. I try to work them out. Thankfully the people i lost touch with are more than happy to invite me back as a friend and such and have been able to talk with them. 

Well that is enough for now."

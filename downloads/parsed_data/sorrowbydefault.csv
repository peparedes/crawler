Ive been sore for awile. 4th block is killing me. But I say with this pain and soreness, the results will be well worth it. I REALLY want a job. Thats sad isnt it. I wish those words didnt have to come out of my mouth. Im going crazy over it though. Because funds are low. I need a new car and I need to start saving for my books and stuff in college. So yea its really crazy. Im really happy being with Candace, she is so understanding. She is letting me off the leash to go to Grubb's and get drunk sociably :D. Candace your the best. I LOVE  you soo MUCH!!!

What a major accomplishment for me. I shall be venturing to K-town everyday. Work like a dog, so I can attend. Its not the enrollment that will kill me. It will be the gas and time.

But most of all I just loved holding her in arms, her sweet scent surronding me and just peting and talking to her. Time seemed to stop a little, for we were lost in its moments.

Candace and I are back together, We've worked out all of our flaws and problems. Everything has been set aside besides that. I've been working for my grandfather at the mines. Its a dirty job but it pays really good. The past few days I've only worked and been with Candace. Last night I went over to her house and we exchanged presents. I dont think she liked mine to well. I got her a promise ring, some yellow roses and a necklace. Oh well you can't win them all!!! I think tonight I shall join Luke and go to the mall. I might go to Grubbs Pre-Chirstmas Party and chill. I might have a drink or two but none else. Cuz yea I don't do that stuff anymore. Kinda makes me sad when I think of all the money I've wasted on it... Lol we learn from our mistakes. Peace.

that David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this :
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...

(Yeah but) Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor, (You know)
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
and love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

Hallelujah...

[Instrumental]

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelu...
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelu...
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

Alittle empty spot and I dont know how to fill it. Hopefully I will soon though. Well im gonna go clean before my parents go mad and start bitching.

I still feel like shit, im defanitely not drinking tonight... If I did it wouldnt be good, especially me feeling like this. Things were ok at the game. I seen Kati and talked to her for a good while, then I left. Most of last night at the party is a blur and it hurts when I try to think about it. Damn alcohol, I hate it with a passion. No, wait I cant say that. I love the feeling it gives you but I hate the results that come after.

She said that she still wants a friendship
She cant live her life without me as a friend
I cant figure out why I'd give a damn to what she wants
I dont understand the now before the then

Most of this garbage I write
That these people seem to like
Is about you
And how I let you infect my life
And if they got to know you
I doubt that they would see it
They'd wonder what i showed you
How you could leave it
A friend in Pineville said that I should stay persistant
If I stay around, im bound to break resistance
Fuck you Cherry Blossom for defining my existance
Fuck you and your differences

Ever since I was a young lad 
With a part time dad
It was hard to find happiness inside of what I had
I studied my mother
I digested her pain
And vowed no woman on my path would have to walk the same
Travel like sound across the fate ladder
I travel with spoon to mix this cake batter
And i travel with feels so i can deal with touch
Its like that 
Thank you very much
Fuck you very much

Yes
Yes it is

And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Yes
Yes it is

And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Fuck the what happend
I got stuck
They can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck
Used to walk with luck
Used to hold her hand
Fell behind and played the role of a slower man
I wanna stand on top of this mountain and yell
I wanna wake up and break up this lake of hell
I feel like a bitch for letting the sheet twist me up
The last star fighter is wounded time to give it up
On a pick it up mission
Kept it bitter
Getting in a million memories just to forget her
The difficulty in keeping emotions controlled
Cookies for the road
Took me by the soul
Hunger for the drama
Hunger for the nurture
Gonna take it further
The hurt feels like murder
Interperate 
The eyes
Read the lines on her face
The sunshine is fake
How much time did i waste?
Fuck you Cherry Blossom for leaving me
Fuck you Cherry Blossom for not needin me
I wanna say fuck you
Because i still love you
No, im not ok 
And I dont know what to do

Yes
Yes it is

And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Yes 
Yes it is
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Do I sound mad?
Well I guess im a little pissed
Every action has a point
Five points make a fist
You close em
You swing em
It hurst when it hits
And the truth can be a bitch
But if the boot fits
I got an idea
You should get a tatoo that says warning
Thats all, just a warning
So the potential victim 
Can take a left and safe breath
And avoid you
Sober and upset in the morning
I wanna scream Fuck you Cherry
But the problem is i love you cherry
So instead 
Ima finish my drink,and have another
While you think about how you used to be my lover
Fuck you

Yes 
Yes it is

And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Yes 
Yes it is

And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Leave never would you, you show could I if....."

...You must die I alone am best!
I hope ya flip some guy the bird,
He cuts you off and you're forced to swerve,
In front of the Beatles' tour bus,
A Bookmobile and a Mack truck,
Hauling hazardous biological waste,
The light turns red you have no brakes,
And ""Hard Copy"" gets it all on tape,
So you can see the look on your face,
...Die Die Die Die Die Die Die!,
...Die Die Die Die Die Die Die!,
I hope your Pinto begins to spin,
Takes out a disabled Vietnam Veteran,
Mows down a Nobel Peace Prize Winner,
And maybe some orphans having Christmas dinner,
Perhaps even the British Royal Family,
And the Rabbi that's clutching the bottle-fed puppy,
And we can't forget the newlyweds,
And those Jerry's Kids are as good as dead,
I hope this helps to emphasize,
I hope this helps to clarify,
I hope you die,
I hope your cellmate thinks he's God,
But C.N.N. refer to him as ""Bowling Ball Bag Bob"",
Serving time again for abuse of a corpse,
Only this time the victim's a Clydesdale horse,
While he masturbates to photos of livestock,
He does the ""Silence of the Lambs"" dance to Christian Rock,
Eats feces and quotes from ""Deliverance"",
And fights with his imaginary playmate Vince,
...Die Die Die Die Die Die Die!,
...Die Die Die Die Die Die Die!,
I hope he grins like Jack Nicholson,
And forces you to play a game called Balls On Chin,
And whatever happens next is all a blur,
But you remember ""fist"" can be a verb,
And when you finally regain consciousness,
You're bound and gagged in a wedding dress,
And the prison guard looks the other way,
'Cause he's the guy ya flipped the bird the other day,
I hope this helps to emphasize,
I hope this helps to clarify,
I hope you die,
...I hope you die!."

"event","The light glares from the alarm clock. The menacing outlines make out 6:50 a.m. I arise out of bed. Sleep trys to overwhelm me. But I fight it off with each step towards the restroom. The light in the hallway glares off the tiling off the floor. As if its laughing, just knowing whats going to happen today. That should have gaven it all away. I do my business and return to my chambers. I begin to dress. One leg at a time. A undershirt followed by a poloshirt to be concealed by a hoodie. I glance at the window, its covered in its last length of frost. 

Fifteen minutes later I arrive downstairs. Light my cigerette off the stove and preceed my way to the bus stop. I linger at the stop. The cold bites my body. Wrapping it in that sense of loathing. On the brink of ice. My feet cheel. My heart throbs. The cold overwhelms me. I take another draw off of my cigerette and begin to stomp the ashes. The cherrys falls, and crumbles. The fire fades off leaving nothing but greyish remains. Like a skeleton revealing its secrets of a past life. Almost muttering to itself ""Why. why did things end like this. Did I not live. Did I deserve this.""

I take it all in. When Suddenly it seems the clouds part and all weight is off my shoulders. The complete and secure feeling of perfect nirvana. Like a warm sunny day with friends at a lake. One of those moments were your just hanging your feet off a side of the boat and letting the sun warm you. Yes I was bathing in my own sun. The center of the nirvana I had created for myself. The one place where happiness always could be found. In the subconcious of my mind. Just that one moment of living.

Then there was no light. I had blinked myself into a white paradox. No walls, no creases just plain lineless white as far as the eyes could see. ""Where am I"" I Thought to myself. There was an old man with specticals. Sitting in a wicker chair. He looked as though he had been waiting on me. He rolled up his white sleeve and looked down at his watch and nodded. He proceeded towards me with a book. A grey book with the letter T on it. The book was massive and I was amazed that such an elderly man could carry such an object.

""James, is it"" muttered the man looking from behind his specticals.  ""Yes"" I replied shocked that he knew my name. ""James, do you know why you are here. You are here because you have failed"". What the fuck I thought. What did I fail at. It gave me that feeling you get when you know you flunked a chemistry test and you just know your going to catch hell from it. ""I do as I pleased. I did no wrong."" was my answer. But I should have known there was no right answer for this quiz. ""You have been sentenced to an eternal limbo. You will live forever in the day of your funeral. Each day you wake you will wonder into your own funeral. This is your punishment.""

God only knows when your word isnt pure. I seen my coffin. Laying there surronded by my friends, relatives and all of those who knew of me. I looked so pale. My hair parted to the side. My eyes closed and a look of solitude fixed on my face. I still wake up everyday to that last day. I fade to my funeral. This is my life. This is what I made of it."

But it just seems she doesnt feel the same about me. She can look me dead in the eyes and tells me she loves me, but I dont feel her words. Its one thing to say you love someone and then a completely different thing to actually love them. Im so lost and I feel theres nothing I can do because really their isnt.

I cant forget what she said.
The moment when she agreed to climb out of my head.
And since then Ive been born to bleed.
I wish I never gave her a reason to leave.

Eight months is a long time.
Three months has made me loose my mind.
And all that time I wished you were here.
Eight months is almost a year.

The nights full of fights and pouring tears.
It lets me know that im a fool for ever loosing you.
Lets make this better or atleast try.
Im tired if waiting here and wondering why.

Because eight months is a long time.
The three months apart made me loose my mind.
And all that time I wished you were here.
Because eight months is almost a year.

I woke up with tears straining down my face.
Never knowing if I have what it takes to finish this race.
I guess eight months isnt so long.
Especially when your gone.
I dont think that you are coming home.

Because eight months is a long time.
The three months apart made me loose my mind.
And all that time I wished you were here.
Because eight months is almost a year.

Eight months is a long time.
Three months made has made me loose my mind.

I wrote her a letter last night and gave it to Josh to give to her. I hope it shows her that I truly care about her. Well anyways heres my song.

Dead December.

A dead December and those reasons to believe.
Maybe this year will be better than the last.
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving.
Now the days go by so fast.

And it's one more day in this mess.
And it's one more night drenched in lonliness.
If you think that I could be forgiven.
I wish you would.

The smell of hospitals in winter.
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters but no pearls.
All at once you look across a crowded room.
To see the way that light attaches to a girl.

And it's one more day up in this mess.
And it's one more night in lonliness.
If you think to come back.
I wish you would.

I woke up without you sometime after two am.
I wanted to talk a little while about the year.
I guess the winter makes you laugh a littler slower.
Makes you talk a little lower.
About the things I could not show her.

And it's going to be a dead December.
And there's reason to believe maybe this time will be better than the last.
I can't remember the last time I tried to tell myself to hold on.
To these moments as they pass.

And it's one more day up in this mess.
And it's one more night in lonliness.
It's been so long since I've seen you.
I guess I should."

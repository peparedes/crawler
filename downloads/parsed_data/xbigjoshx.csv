"event","ok so today.
i woke up miserable as ever sweating bullets and i was sooo freaking cold. My dad had woken me up gave me some asprin and put me back to bed. I woke up at 2pm sweating profusely and like not AS cold because the asprin had kicked in. Then i walked around gaining some strength and went on the computer for like 30 min. So stupid little crust-punk tried talking mad crap on my girl so i set her straight. Now her boyfriend is trying to threaten me that iam gonna get jumped by some ""real punx, show you that punx ARENT dead"" bahahahaha i laughed very hard and replied that for his safety he BETTER not try to get friends into this. You all know how many crazy people i can get, specially to woop ass on some <b>CRUST PUNX</b> bahahaha. Then i got into the shower which was so painful because of my bodyaches. I hurried and got dressed then went to the doctor. The doctors was really scary. Normally my doctor does like a check-up etc. and tells me to tuffen up and gives me some medicine and dosent say much. This time he was speaking in a very serious manner and told me there's something wrong and i need to get blood work done. So this is really scary for me, and my dad wont let lauree visit me and iam barely gonna be well enough to play at the whisky monday.

"event","<font face=tahoma size=1>Ok well last night was the beach with like UAC and more and it was pretty freaking fun. The weather was gay but sydney's parents were way cool and got us so much stuff. The best part was probably dustin, mercer, derek and myself running down the shore for like a half mile singing blink182. Then we saw the most amazing thing, like at 930 we went down to watch the waves. Its jellyfish season right, well everytime a wave broke like it would be light up BRIGHT sea green, because of like the eletric jellyfish. It looked like a light show. 
Then today..
Today sucked i woke up really really sick. Ive been sick for like 4 weeks and i was so miserable today. My parents started to take me to the hospital but i told them not to. So i was just really really sick, and lauree was gonna come over tommorrow to take care of me but my dad wont let her so iam kinda pissed about that.

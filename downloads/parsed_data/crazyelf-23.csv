So it was me, weeza, apu, and nach...... oh and apu's new name is crotch wheels while nacho's new name is booty. we took the bus, got there not knowing what we were gonna see and after much deliberation we decide to see meet the fockers. went to the arcade, then two starbucks, got a brain freeza b/c they made me drink my frapuccino fast!!! apu said wonka was a rascist and im gonna kick his ass, b/c he made me choke on my drink. oh, and he tried to kill me with a airhockey puck. oh and he hurt my already injured hand. ( i think apu was out to kill me) lol memo to myself: give crotch wheels an ass wooping.... ok so we saw the movie, as i said before, i laughed and i liked it, ppl were fockerized, it was all good. umm wento to weezas house where i got me a present: a scarf ( which i had to close my eyes for b/c it wasnt wraped with the other present) and a shaver, you know to shave my beard... ok well not my beard but weeza showed me her before i got mine and i liked it, its all electronic and what not.... so thank ya weeza... hey but are you trying to tell me something.... that i have hairy legs... because i do but no one needs to know that hehe jk, loved the gift... thanx!!!!

ok i had fun today.. but now off my fun subject...................................

ARROGANCE IS STUPIDITY......
arrogant ppl are stupid, thinking your better than someone dosent make your better than that person, it just makes you stupid... in fact thinking your better than that person only makes you less than that person because you think less of them. how dare you arrogant ppl show your face in this world, its ppl like you who make this world a stupid self centered world that it is, with superficial ppl. ARROGANCE only leads to vanity. actually stupid ppl are in fact smarter than the arrogant. It gets me so mad to think that people think they are better than others when they are clearly not, no one is better than anyone, yes of course some ppl are better off, they may not be sick or poor, but that doesnt give them the right attacke someone who isnt as well off. just because your well off dioesnt make you better than anyone else. and the only all ppl are created equal crap is just a saying b/c if were all creted equal we would all be treated with the same respect but we aren't...... some ppl are just mean and dumb and aroogant and ruthless. im also mad at the discrimanting of ppl or the racism in this world. and if you really think about we are all a little discrimanated or discriminators and we may not realize it, and we are all a liitle aroogant. when we dont like someone we dont think much of them and that kind of makes us a little arrogant, so im arrogant... your arrogant ... evryones arrogant... and we cant help who we like and dont like... even if the person is really mean, obnoxious, concided or whatever. i dont know why i started this mad ranting of mine... it probably doesnt make sense but its just something to think about.     Its amazing how we are all so different yet the same..... it really boggles the mind....
oh wells 
see ya all in school"

"event","i had fun!
so yesterday and today me and weeza went to the school, our way there was funny , shes crazy,  we almost get runover a few times. people don't know how to drive, or i dont't know how to walk. i think its a lil of both, ummm... oh yeah i freeloaded off her food and we watched tv.. something aboiut celebrities getting pumped crap out from their butts. Very disturbing!!! i forget what it is called but what they do is that they put a tube up your crack (you may or may not feel a sensation) and the they pump out all the bad stuff in you, which pretty much dehydrates you and makes you skinny. i thouhgt this was both funny and disturbing at the same time! i think Society today is really retarded! i mean, people see these celebrities today and they all want o follow in that image, where skinny is beautiful and so people do anything to get skinny. that isn't healthy, people take pills with ephandren and that is way bad for you because its preety much speed that your taking. but oh wells enough about society, weeza is a funny one, we saw a crazy lady today who scared the hell out of me, almost giving me a heart attack!!! she was in her chair with her back facing the street and a scarf over her head like a hood, and she would move all freaky like. it scared me:( then we went to buy some pizza and some guy gave us 5 cents, we were looking for a penny. a dog attacked me on the way to school, and we watched my extended edition of the two towers all lazy like! .... weeza has her christmas tree in the middle of the room and i told her to leave it there, oh and im gonna steal her fishy, she has a cute bumblebee fish.
when i got home today i talked to georgey, i hadn't talked to him in the longest, it was good times, oh and then i called other friends like candy and we talked for hours, my battery of my cell phone died and then i just continued my conversation on my house phone. so i think i may go out tomorrow

.. oh yeah... weeza reminded me of when jose ran over velasco's foot a while back, that was freakin' hilarious! hahahaahahaaha lol oh my gosh now i can't stop laughing, man that was a funny moment... jose didnt even know he ran him over and carlos didn't even tell him, we were just laughing!!!! man, GOOD TIMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)"

DONT WATCH IT!! well unless you want to be bored out of your mind for two damn hours!!!
Tiffany told me that she doesn't have to read Dracula, i don't want to read it either!!!!! how dare she!!!!!! well i don't want to read what she has to read instead either... 
... regarding the subject of this journal, i was bored so i translated my name to a hobbit name, i know i'm weird. well so thats my name. then i saw a icon of johnny depp in his willy wonka movie, and now amma use it as my icon. he looks crazy in that movie. he has fake teeth and whaty not so when he smile he looks all psycho-ed out!!!!

"event","ok so here i am, finally typing some crap.
umm lets see.. today i was supposed to go to school to get some stuff done for my private school applications, but i didnt because im a lazy one, and i went to velascos house for no reason, i didnt even turn in those dumb papers. Man i have a whole mess of crap  to do in order to get into a damn school. i don't know why universities just don't let you in. i mean, as long as your not a serial arsonist or anything, you would have nothin' to worry about; but no, you have to fill out all this crap, you have to send all this crap, and write all this crap. this is hurtful for the hands and stressful for the kid especially a lazy one. I'm TIRED, and i have no idea what i want to do with my life. I figure i'll figure it out sooner or later. hopefully....
oh, and i found out that there are people who are more lost than i am when it comes to applications, and that teens are such procrastinators.. well i already kinda knew the last one.
ok so i walked my dog all around the blocks near my casa, she had fun, i was just observing ppls houses and christmas decorations. I'm supposed to be reading now, but im too lazy.

oh, last week i went to the movies with mari, it was cool we talked and we saw bridget jones II. that was my first rated R movie i saw in the theatres.... legally. oh and then we snuck into that sponge bob movie for no apparent reason, we didnt likey the movie, i have no idea why we were in there. maybe it's because the theatre was so damn empty it was easier to sneak into a movie. thats odd. you would think that a full theatre would be easier because there are so many damn ppl. i think that because there are more ppl i think there are also more ppl working in the theater and the less people the less they care. and because there were hardly anybody, people were not doing there job. ahha, i got it, i came to a conclusion all on my own. ......ok that was lame..... yeah so i had fun.....umm  the next on my list is to see CLOSER, and the Series of Unfortunate Events., but i have to finish the books for that one. oh, yeah i composed a song on some gargage band thing on this macintosh. i like it, its the coolest, i went all crazy one day trying to find beats that went along with the rest of my song. hey, i think i might just burn it on to a CD. 

... well i think i'm leaving somewhere this weekend, I'm just not quite sure where. i'm hoping its too the snow b/c i like snow:),(not yellow snow or fecal snow, thats nasty ewww) but i dont think it is. i really want to learn how to ski or snowboard, they're both cool. ok i'm off..... to see the wizard the wonderful wizard of oz. lalalaalala"

"event","ok so lately ive kinda been mad and sad at the world and my life. Why, who knows, its a lot of reaons actually. lIfe is stressing, and it weird cuz when i want to talk to someone nothing will come out and then im just left with me never coming back to that idea.  aND Its weird cuz ill listen to peoples problems for days and ill give my input at times, it just that when it comes to my lame problems, i fell that i am not able to share them. I know i know, people tell me were here for you, you can talk to us, see thats the thing, ive mentioned that before, i cant, i physiccaly can, but my mindset is like elsewhere and im not able to show the real mood behind me. or when someone asks, i wont tell, for some strange unknown reason.im weird like that, i seriously think that i should see a therapist, oh and i should relly got see my doctor, cuz my migraines have recently been reoccuring. that leads me to another subject....
i now have migraines b/c im too streesed out, man dumb preparing for the future, wanting to get into a 4 year university me. Sometimes i wishi had an extra year, but not as a year where i would be doing the same thing or preparing for school and stuff, i mean, i want a year away from it all. I want to leave like far, but at the same time i don't, i kind of fear the future.There are times where i wish i could just get up one day and got to some far away place where no one knows me and i could start all over, and live carefree, but i know thats a fabtasy in my head, and one really cant live like that. so i go this thing from st. luois university or something like that; it was talking about studying for two years in madrid or someplace they speak spanish and you like live there for two or depending on your major, more years. i actually considered doing that. I want to go out and see the world. i wan to travel, new zealand here i come.

.... so lately ive also been missing the good ol'days.. i found myself writng a letter to a friend during 3rd period, well it started out as a letter to my friend, and then i began to rable on about stuff, in my saddened mood. i would type it but its too long to type, well i was rambling on about some of the stuff i had mentioned about missing the good ol days, living carefree, me not being able to sleep lately, my headaches, my B.S about me not able to show emotions, but ill cry for some stupid sappy movie, how i hold back a lot about myself, crushes and how i havent found me a guy, i know pathetic, and basically life in general.......well my letter wasnt quite finished because someone stopped me and made me laugh. i realized that no matter how down i  am laughter can always make you feel better, and humor is not the easiest thing because what can be funny to some may not be funny to others.. So anyways, i thiought to myslef about humor and how it  can make one feel better and it got me out of my mood for the moment.  and humor is the greatest thing, when ones laughing, they arent going to be thinking about the bad things, its great!!!  maybe that should have been my greatest. oh wells.     laughter Is fun!!!!

so i leave you with soe quotes:
         *** life is too important to take seriously*** ~Henry J. Tillmen
         *** lazziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired*** ~Jules Renard
         *** Laughter is by defintion healthy*** ~Doris Lessing
         *** You can't deny laughter, when it comes, it plops down in your favorite chair  and stays as long as it wants*** ~Stephen King
         *** Laugh and the world laughs with you...*** ~A. Burgess

ps: mari, i miss my ramones cd, if you remember can you return it too me, cuz i always forget to tell you at school!!!!!"

Have you ever just felt distant? cuz thats how ive been feeling lately, like i just dont belong anywhere. Its some crazy stuff, i dont like it at all, but i cant help feeling this way. im distant with my friends , im distant with my family and with everyone else around me. Its a horrible feeling, i just fell like letting it all out, but thats not me... im not the kind of person who does that... im in a weird state of mind. I feel many things at this moment i just can't explain... 
this week ive been kind of grouchy and mean and i know i have probably done something to someone that they probabaly mistook, i just want to apologize to everyone for my mood, i havent gotten enough sleep, and i feel all weird. Im not happy at school and i'm not happy at home, i dont know what to do. again, im in my own lil world... I dont mean to be all mean and distant, but im irratated with myself....
... I FEEL ALL BLAH, i dont know whats up with me, i can't think properly... :( I'm starting to miss people, and it s weird cuz some of the people i miss are around me everyday. i do however, miss my grandma for some strange odd reason, i miss my buddy candy, i miss christopher and angie, believe it or not i actually miss my 1st grade friend stephanie, and i miss my life back in the good old days. I try not to think of these deprssing things but sometimes i cant hel[p myself, i cant put up that happy face anymore, i try, but i just keep telling myslef... ""for what? Why do i need to be happy for others when im not happy inside?"" WHATEVERS, i dont know what to think anymore, i guess you can say im kind of depressed, but im more of just .... i odnt know how to explain....

Im glad i have this journal, because if i didnt i wouldnt know how to express myself, because i guess you can say im a coward in person when it comes to how i feel.
 i guess thats enough depressing stuff for today, ... i went o the dodgers game yesterday... they lost against the marlins... who am i kidding i cant act all normal now, im just too out of it now to write  about what i did yesterday...

"event","so im listening to some coldplay, because you can never tire of coldplay no matter how much you listen to it. So beautiful. anyways...
     On friday i ate burritos with marisela, marisol and velasco. there was some cops outside cuz some gangsters were fighting or what not, crazy carlos  and mari were all saying the guy talked to us, and all he asked was if they were in line, i find that hilarious. i thought they meant like full SENTENCESSSSS!! HEEH crazy ones. Anyways, i wasgonna go get my eyebrows done for my year book pisture which was to take place on saturday. so i waited fo my sisters to arrive so they could take me. Wewent to this place called Ziba's. its cool cuz they do your eyebrows with a string. crazy huh? well now my eyebrows are thiner. it didnt hurt. the lady who did them was nice they were all like indian-ish and they were talking there own language. it was funny i was paying attention to two ladys who were talking another language, it was some intersting stuff. 
     So saturday i went to go take my senior yearbook photo at 10 AM, i took wezza with me. the dumb crazy guy who took my picture was dorky. he was all trying to converse withme and weeza and make us smile and show our braces. that loser!! then i couldnt help but laugh at him when he was taking my picture. he made me tilt my head like a doggy. i was like what if i blink, cuz i tend to blink when im photgraphed. hes all like dont worry. i was like easy for you to say, its not youbeing photgraphed. he was a strange man. it was some funny stuff though. oh yeah when we were all done coming out crappy on our pics, we were heading to the car, and what do you know, my daddy left the keys in the car. i had a good laugh. well we took a ride with weezas mom. we hollared at her to pick us up. that was some funny stuff. got home and watched some movies on HBO- BY THE WAY I NOW HAVE SATELLITE AND IM ADDICTED TO THE tv!!!! 
    sunday... tried doing my homework, but couldnt stop watching tv, so it took me a while. My daddy made some carne asada, it was yummy. watched some more movies, ate some food, yeah crazy weekend. well, now im online on fastweb seeing some scholarships available to me, college is stressing me out, but meh! ...

Anyways, today is fathers day and i didnt do much, i did however make a yummy breakfast for my daddy. that made him happy, we didnt do much cuz my daddy didnt want to go out ergo i became bored at home. i went crazy mad downlading ring tones and wallpapaer for my cell phone. Abou tthe only thing shcoking that happened today was that Christopher called me. I was like dude i havent talked to this fool in the longest. Itwas weird at first, but then we started talking and it was like good ol times. anyways it didnt bring back any feelings though, i was actually glad i was able to talk to him.

Anyways before reading today i woke up watched some cartoons(hehe) and then i was watching movies. i watches the return of the king, finding nemo and Patch adams. oh then i saw this commercial on T.V. about some show coming to abc(ch7) on wednesdays this fall; its called LOST, it seemms interseting,it also stars Dominic Monaghan(you ppl dont know who he is, weeza does) havent watched tv in the longestmaybe i should finda show to watch and get addicted to. Speaking abou addictions (sorry for jumping off topic im bored) i sawsomething about ppl doing things compulsively and no realizing its bad. like drinking a lot of cofee is an adiction if you do it cumpusivley, Instant messaging as well, well anyways it wa this crazy quiz you take to see if you were addicted to your cell phone, cofee, candy whatevers. Something about doing these things compulsivley can cause stress and thats not good. i was reading the ym issue for this month, many intersting stuff in that magazine, not only cuz it has my hot lover orlando bloom in it, but there was some articles about gay parents and a teen exposed to skin cancer. Crazy Juune!! Johnny Deeps Birthday is in June it was on the 13th , i think. oh wells, so Bored!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","So on thursday i went to Rancho with ochoa and velasco. Mari couldn't come cuz she was prisoner of her casa. At Rancho we did same ol same ol. i was in the same spot i was last time, yelling out numbers in the romm. That crazy black man that was there last time was still there and damn he was still freaking hilarious. there was a new black man too and both of them won bingo. it was funny cuz the new black man called out bingo and isaid possible bingo, and hes all like.. ""what do you mean possible bingo, i know i got bingo"" then hes all like ""black men can win bingo that other fool cant be the only black man wining, he be cheating"" He was refering to to the other black man who had already won the five bucks from bingo. oh yeah and when that fool got bingo the other one was yelling and calling him a cheater, it was funny, i laughed at them. Meanwhile ochoa was sleepy on the floor and i had to pee for a point in time. After Bingo ended we went to go sing happy birthday to a patient because we neglected to give that room drinks and dougnuts!! then meanwhile eating our doughnuts outside we see kitties playing and daniella busts out and say she thought the kitties were a girl and ochoa agreed with her, the were both on crack. anyways then when we were leaving in the ochoas car, they locked me out and were about to leave me :( and after a a little while of being left outside of the car, when i got in they started going crazy. well it seems to me that they are always crazy and thats what makes it funny. they were making noises and what not and aksing crazy stuff. then we decided to go to maris house and we stayed outside talking, oh yeah mario was there too, all i recall is laughing but thats what i seem to have be doing lately with these people. theya are crazy and funny. yes and today we went to maris house again to play jenga. we got some mexican candy along the way. I spilled all over myself with the frozen ice crap and everthing, ochoa danced hilariously his beyonce, mari did a belly danced and didnt know what blowing a raspberry was, velasco sang and most of his dares were done on me. It was  a crazy day with mucho laughter!!!!"

"event","well heres my update. I had my comfirmation on Friday may 28th and the partay was the next day. Lets just say i had better times at partays. first of all i never wanted the retaded partay, i thought it was a piontless thing and i had told my mom but since all of the mothers wanted one, i was like sure why not. I dont think either me, weeza or emma wanted one. I'm not saying i didnt enjoy my gifts and my buddies there cause i'm glad my peeps came because i would be sooooooooooo bored without you guys. Well anyways yeah i didnt want to be there, and hey weeza why were you like leaving yourself out, i know you felt secluded but you shouldn't have freakin secluded yourself with emma. ok this is my opinion, i dont want to be mean and tell me if i am but you and emma seclude yourself from the world, and thats isnt good i mean im not bagging on you and i am not the person to really be giving you advice cuz remeber im the closed book but yeahi mean loosen up go crazy not saying your not, cuz i heard you were taking pics of boobs, but i mean emma used to be soo different and now i see her and shes like so different and not in a good way... i think im being redundant..??? im saying this because you guys were totally bombed in the partay when you were byyourselfs, i mean i was toatlly bored myself and hated the partay for many other reason after but yeah, i say thigns like thins cuz i wuv and care for my buddies and i want happy times for them, yeah i know sound totally korny but i don't like my friends to be sad even though at times i am. Stupid sadness. anyways now that im in this sadness... heres some of my crap life.Well after the paraty my dad got drunkererer. and i HATE my dad drunk i hate anyone drunk, wait i take that back, i dont hate. even myself was once drunk but i do regret it and i hate the fact that i did it. i mean people can drink, its just moderation, but in my opinion well ive learned through my stupid life experiences that alcohol isnt really smart i know i sound like a health techer or a commercial but its true. I come from a long line of alcoholics persay... my grandpa was an alcoholic, my uncles, my dad and the the worse thing is that my sis Denisseis a drunk(not to be mean), she thinks we dont see or dont smell her but we can totally see shes been drinking. she comes home smelling like booze, she throws up allover her sheets and shes totally incoherant. Im not bagging on people who drink, and if carlos your reading this im not bagging on you either, it just im so sad and overwhelmed when i see people drunk that i care about. i just feel like crying, i care for my family and friends and i want them to be happy but not in a way thats bad for them. When my dad got drunk on sat he made my brother cry and that is like the first time i've ever seen him cry ever since he was like 6. so its the first time in like 5 or so years ive seen him cry. He hurt my sister emotionally and my mum, nad my brother and me. i pretended like if it was nothing but it really was something, i can't cry in fromt of my family( which is sad)so basically..... 
.... ive come to the conlclusion that my journals make me sad because i just release everything, which is total relief yet at the same time crap, because it just brings back horrible stuff..."

At first i went to school at like 12:20 and oh my goodness i attended the cult, for those who dont know what the cult is , well it's Key Club, lol, i saw velasco facilitate his first meeting hehe, well anyways, i was trying to avoid mr. putnam, by nto looking that way and he saw me, damn, stupid carlos juarez was just laughing at me, man crazy mr. putnam gave me this weird hand shack i was like what the hell, oh lol and he gave velasco his phone number, i had a good laugh, cause he wants him. Anyways then i went to go lean at the review for apes, our team won, wahoo, i didnt answer much but tiffany made me laugh, she kept raising her hand in the review game when it wasn't even her turn, lol i laughed at her. anywyas, after that i went to learn at ivywest, and then i went to my art class, man i went crazy. I finally ate a six dollar burger at carls, and i burned my tongue trying to chug down fries. Oh but that burger ws freaking good. Yummmmmmmmmm. It was fuuny, cause during class i was pretending to be daisy, cause shes in that class to, and the teacher asked her a question and i answered saying no, hehe pretending i was her, the teacher thought it was her, it was hilarious; it was crazy because it is always dark in the class because he is always showing slides. wel now im home and oh my goodness, its tommorow hheheheh, man well mari wanted to knwo about my crazy grandma, well she turned crazy after my grandfather died of like a heart attack and she left my da and his brother and sister to take care of themselves, and thats why my adady had a hard life, he had to geta job to help support the family, he joined the marines, and thats where he gets his bad temper from, he yells because he was yelled at when he was in the marines, hes nice to me (sometimes, and when he wants to be )the most because i dont let myself, and im like the youngest daughter, i mean i dont blame him because hes like had the freaking roughest child hood ever its beyond belief, but sometimes, i wish he was a lil more father like, i hardly see him  and i dont talk to him, ergo, my negelction begins. Anyways.. ive wanted to say someething..... its gonna be two weeks on saturday since i last talked to my ex boyfirend christpher. Ive wanted to talk to him and call him up to see how hes doing, but i dont have the courage too, i get my phone and i just hold it in my hand without marking a number, i just stare off into space, man i really want to talk to him, i mean just because i dont like him doesn't mean i don't wanna be his friend. man, i feel utterly confused...."

Maybe i should have gone cause it sounded like fun, and it would have gotten me out of my migranial depressed mood. Sorry i missed out, i was kind of sad for no apparent reason. anayways congrats, now your closer to god; its sad cause i don't think confirmation has gotten me closer to god, but i want to be, i want to experience my religion cause before i thought it did nothing for me and i thought there was no piont to it cause if god doesnt care about me why should i care about him.i used to think religion was just something to brainwash you, now i dont know what to believe, i dont have faith and it scares me and it also gets me mad that even my faith negelcts me, stupid neglection. damn now im getting down on myself again, THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS!!!!!!!!

"event","Wow you guys, i am finally making a journal about my life. Cause i know im like a closed booked to my buddies, so this is a lil' something to inform ya'll. Ok so what do you want to know... Why im a closed book? well thats because i cant talk to ya'll, its probably cause i dont even talk to my family, i don't know why, but i just cant talk to them. I have sisters but i mean we arent that close to talk about stuff like guys and stuff.My first Boyfriend, Jacob, i met in San Fransico, when we were going to drop my sister off at Berkley. He became my BF after knowing him for i don't even remember how long. He was nice, sure he lived far away he was a great guy, or so i thought, we broke up because i heard that he still liked this girl and supposedly still liked me, well anyways enough about him, if you wnat to know more about Jacob, just respond to me and ill tell you what you wanna know. Well recently my love life has sucked, i know i didnt tell you guys about what im about to tell you, and for that I'M SORRY!, but the last month of school was hectic and we were all kind of drifting apart.i Told Mari this on Thursday night so, i guess whomever else reads  this will know as well, well for the last 3 weeksish i had a boyfriend, yeah, i was not single, his name is Christopher. Well im not with him anymore. We broke up because i didn't feel like i liked him anymore. I met him because he was my exboyfriends (Jacob) best friend, well now they aren't friends. Anyways he liked me and i liked him for like the longest and we didnt do anything about, Well we would go out on dates and stuff, and well one time i actually got drunk when i was with him, crazy Cybil, i know its shocking, im not innnocent, but when i got drunk, he was such a nice guy inspite of me acting all stupid and retarded. He took me home and was the nicest ever, yeah well thats over, but somethimes i just catch myself looking back at the good times in life, and it kind of gets me sad, because i see us (the fantastic four) slowly parting, and i dont want that i  mean hows it gonna be like when we graduate are we gonna lose touch? It just gets me sad sometimes, i mean sometimes we are evolved in our own lives that we ignore our friends, i know i do that, and sometimes i do that because i feel negelcted. I hate the feeling of neglection, being one of the middle children im always neglected, someties it makes me depressed because sometimes my parents dont even care where i am, i know my mom is always paranoid and asks me where i go and dont get me wrong i love my mama, but sometimes i feel like my family doesnt even care about me. And then when my friends ignore me it makes me feel even worse. There was a point in school where we were at the table and luisa had her man, Mari had her man and then Kathy would leave so i would feel totatlly awkward, mari, i would feel the saddest when you would ignore me the most, because i would be talking to you and then all of a sudden you would talk to your muffin, i mean its okay to talk to your man, but it made me feel bad when you would just totally ignore, when i havent even finished speaking to you. Sometimes i just get down on myself, stupid feeling of depression. Hopefully i dont go crazy like my grandma, oh yeah did i mention, my grandma from my dads side went crazy when my grandpa died, we dont know where she is or so thats what my parents tell me who knows what else they neglect to tell me. Did i tell you my mother and father neglected to tell me and my siblings that my sister Vanessa is not my full sister, shes my half sister, and you know what the shitty thing about that was when they told us, they told us on Thanksgiving, which was total crap, because i was happy that day because i wasnt gonna eat Turkey because they made lasagna yummm, then we all felt like crap that day. This journal entry is like super long!!!, you guys tell me what you think of it and write comments or questions if you have any, thats a ""brief"" (you can say that) summary of my life, well kind of, i just dont want to type anymore, so you guys just respond back!!!!"

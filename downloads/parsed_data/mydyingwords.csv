"event","not to long ago i had this dream i jumped through a wall and in it i consciously know i was dreaming so i practiced it over and over again. in the dream i made myself a freak show putting my hands, legs and fingers through things. i woke up and grabbed a marker and tried to put my finger and it felt like i could. for a moment i thought i was going to then i lost it. from that day one of my goals in life was to walk through a wall before i died."

"event","this morning i left work 30 minutes early to buy donuts from the donut shoppe for work. i ended up being 15 minutes late. but where i work that's okay. when i got here somebody had all ready bought donuts. so i hid mine in my desk drawer. i guess i didn't want to take away from there generosity. then i got busted eating one of my donuts so i acted like they were the other ones and thanked them for them. i sort of enjoy this idea cause i did what i had to. it's like there was no way i would have put my donuts next to theirs and there was no way i was going to say it was mine to make them feel like i didn't appreciate them bringing in their donuts. it's like noticing how i am and having little to no contol over it and that i didn't get it from a billboard or commercial. i don't know why that means anything to me it just does."

"event","i think the reality of humans existing is impossible. i think we live in the idea of the possibility of existence. i can't tell you if this is the world i created or if by the idea of rules existing we somehow all co-exist in that idea.
i'm more likely to believe this is my world and i invented everything in it. but i feel bad telling anyone that or think it's very egotistical to think.
i think my reality can possibly be a invention of a experiment of dream studies for the creation of ideas and inventions.
i think the best way to understand something is to have no desire for it. the farther you pull yourself away from it the more you will have true knowledge of it.
i think the more you learn the the less you are to understanding what knowledge you posses. yet even in understanding that ""true"" knowledge you somehow are learning littler. just cause it's a new idea doesn't mean it's any different from a old one. somehow to know something is to know what it is you don't know.
i think everything in this world is exactly the same. it possess all and nothing at the same time. a piece of shit can make you upset now if stepped on yet if it were a billion years old be the greatest find in are existence.
i think there is no way i understand anything. if you can't tell me how the world began or what it really is. how are you going to yell at me and tell me columbus was the first to discover america.
i think thinking has become a fad so i don't like talking about it. i don't care for celebrity status so i think i'm just going to write everything down and give it to someone in my will in hope someone might say, ""he live his life different then most"". that pretty much all i'm looking for.
i think people had the capability of doing everything today as they did in prehistoric times they just lack the knowledge. so my minds open to the possibility of those ideas coming to me in dreams. i think with thinking that's possible they have and will.
i think it's upsetting that when i talk to people i have to forget i think all this. at the same time i think, ""i don't know anything, everything i think is bogus""  it's like i won't let myself feel special cause i don't want to put myself before other people.
i think my most favorite thing asides jenny and rory is my sleep paralisis. it's cause i have no control over it. i like the idea of that. that i do something that the world's economic stratagies or society has no control over. my sleep paralisis to me is like a clear thought.
my problem is i think all this and it makes it hard to react or respond to people or things. i think me posting is the same as me not posting. i think if i'm not doing this i'm doing something else but the void still gets filled. i've never been more then what we think of as alive. i think of life as like watching television and i just have to decide what channel i want to watch."

"event","when i have dreams at night i listen to what people say and i get them to speak faster. i know that before they say those words i have no idea what there going to say next. i also read stuff in my dreams and try to read so fast my mind can't think of the next sentence and i get to a end or the words start making no sense but it never happens. then i think about what i just read or heard and it will be about a city in a place that i never been that has more sheep to human in population. something odd but it makes sense. i relate this to when i'm awake in it just confuses me. how am i suppose to know what reality is if there are no flaws in my dreams. or at least i wont know till i wake up."

"event","i don't think people that hang out with me understand how close i feel to losing my mind. it's mostly because of the thoughts i have. like, i think everything is possible. the thought that humans could have done everything today as they did during prehistoric times but lacked the knowledge drives me crazy. just the thought that i can possibly levitate or read minds as of right now but i lack the knowledge is mind wrecking.i feel like the best way to understand a object is to not have any desire for that object. the idea that if the world exploded right now no human ever would have accomplished anything makes me upset. the thought that this could all be a dream. the idea that energy is never lost it just gets displaced in something else so the thought of where it all came from to begin with drives me crazy. when i think about how commercialized the american living style is drives me crazy. the thought that i can try to figure out the existence of life for the rest of my life and the idea that it can just pop in someone elses head makes me crazy. the thought that when i die it will seem like it was just a second ago i was writing this drives me crazy. the way people will yell at me and think i'm stupid cause they think 2+2=4 and i don't cause the idea of decimals and fractions exist drives me crazy. the idea of how human settle on things cause they don't understand them drives me crazy. i don't get why there is a perfect way a glass sits in obsessive compulsive disorder. the idea that i govern my mind and how i think i know how to free it but i can't cause i might hurt someone, drives me crazy. listening to people tell me god is great. the idea that everything can be looked at exactly the same it's just perceived different. how people think there are such things as gases. how people think there is a difference in the life of a ant and the life of a whale. and the way that if want to have a normal conversation with someone i have to forget about all this and how i can't just let go. how acting this way is forcing me to live in a life i will inspire people in, but will never do what i was capable of doing. i think i can change science, redesign the world, and i think i know how to live forever. some of these thought alone make my days hard. i just try to forget i believe them. sometimes i think the best thing for me is to go to prison and just write."

"event","sometimes when it think of my mom i think of someone else. like a heavenly mom waiting for me. to hold me in her arms and not let me go and she tells me she proud of me and she glad i'm with her, and she never wants me to leave her again. for some reason when i picture it i'm little again."

"event","i was sitting in traffic and i looked over at this flower and i was jealous. maybe cause it's purpose was to grow and die and it didn't have all the options in life i have, that i was aware of. then this thought came to me. ""what if were all energy just different forms of it"". like what if a flower is a flower cause that what kind of energy source it is. like energy with character. like i'm energy but the human kind that walks, talks, thinks, and runs. but in a way i'm just like the flower. it made me smile. it was a wierd happiness. it was shocking cause i never felt that kind of happiness before, like it was pure. i got to thinking and i think it was cause it had nothing to do with money or sex. i was happy cause i felt happy about who i was."

"event","i got a dictionary yesterday. now all i have to do is figure out the right combination of words and i'll have the menu for the cure for aids, cancer, the speech to stop or start world war III. with the right combination of words i can become a astronaut, or get into the harvard college of advanced studies.  make anyone fall in love with me. i can get someone to tell me who killed jfk. there will be words the make sunsets more descriptive. i wonder if that means that would make them more colorful? is that possible? i wonder if there is one word that means more colorful?"

"event","iv'e been thinking alot about how everyone is trying to make since out of all this and really i think we lost all identity of the possiblity of understanding life. iv'e been thinking about how our world has turned into a world with communism and barter and trades. i'm so upset on he way america is about the economy and money. what the fuck happen to us what forces of nature made us start fighting for survival. i wonder why we think there is intellegent life out there. there can be any sorts of things. i think what we are is a fuck up. all i see is evil and creed in humans. i'm sure there is a world of mirror balls that live off sunlight and in turn reflect sunlight onto the surrounding life in turn getting sunlight from others. that's it. why does it have to be more than that. eveything else just seems pointless to me. i wonder what desire compeled humans to be anything more than a plant. i wonder if there was a clear thought of wanting to be more then a plant or the possibilty of being thinking walking creature was possible to fathom. i wonder what we will become. maybe planets."

What about the rest of you? I've seen you around, but I've been rather busy and couldn't talk. So, how have you all been?"

They said I can't go yet. Bugger. Unfortunately they didn't tell me <i>when</i> I could see you, but Dumbledore promised I would be able to go there. Just not now.

Dumbledore, amidst Snape's snarky comments, told me the story of the Brotherhood and also of the Knights of Walpurgis. Turns out Voldemort wants you so that he can become immortal, a <i>God</i>, since you are ""the purest of blood"" and ""the key to ascension"". You probably know this already but... *shrugs* I didn't know.

<s>I fear for you</s>


I love you. I promise I won't let him get you. <s>I'd rather die</s>


<s>I miss you so much</s>

"event","I never thought I'd be spending my seventeenth birthday on a bloody mission to rescue Pansy bloody Parkinson. Yeah, I'm with one of my best friends and with my <s>lover</s> <s>boyfriend</s> ""special friend"", but it's not the same. 
We're going to have to catch a train to London and the Knight Bus to Cardiff,but we also have a damsel in distress (not that I can see Pansy in that role but, whatever. She is one at the moment) that needs to be rescued and quite a few abductors to defeat, who can be Death Eaters for all we know. 
On top of it all, I'm feeling insecure. I don't know how Draco will react to Parkinson's return, and I'm scared to think that he may go back to her. To that ""more than just friends"" relationship they have. And I don't know if I can handle that. 
I love him more than anything and I know he loves me too, and I just wish wish that my fear doesn't have any reasoning. 
 
God, I wish Corner was here. I'm in dire need of some stress relief. *sighs*"

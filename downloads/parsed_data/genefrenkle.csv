so on friday after ryan left i was guna take the subway to sams so we could go to laurens party, so im in the subway right (by myself), everythings fine, and then we kinda just slow down and stop, and its very dark, and i here the voice from the speaker-thing saying ""we're having some technical difficulties"" so im freaking out a little bit, but then they finally get the thing working and im like score, so then we get to our stop and i get out, but it sure as fuck didnt look like west hollywood, so i found out i took the wrong train and was wayyyyyyy far away from sammys house and was in some really sketch scary area of town, so i called sam from a pay phone (cuz collin dropped mine in the toilet like a month ago) and could really figure out how to work it and ended up spending like $1.50 in it just to tell sam i was lost.  so i had spent all my money and was stranded in the middle of far away at like 6 on a friday.  so i ended up sneaking on a the right train, and i was llike yesssss but then the doors closed and the train wouldnt start for like 20 minutes and i was like shit just my luck, but then they got it working and when it was sams stop i got out and ran past the security gaurds and found sam and embraced him, then he yelled at me cuz im retarted. the end."

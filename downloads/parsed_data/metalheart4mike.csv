"event","whoohoo... crappy day, crappy afternoon, crappy night. yay my favorite. oh well whatever.  

i keep thinking about this one thing i used to do that i want to do again, but i can't :(  it's so hard not to... grr to everyone who is trying to keep me from it. haha but thanks, too... 

yeah... 

anyway, i made $25 babysitting tonight. that was cool, i need the money really badly.  i'm working a lot the next two weeks and i think i have a nice paycheck waiting for me at mcdonald's, thank god haha. 

i just realized something today.  i apologize too much for things and i always ask why? to everything haha. strange. 

yeah, well i can't stop the tears, so i'm going to sneak out my window and sit outside.

later."

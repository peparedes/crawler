"event","I can't hold on much longer,
If only I were just a little stronger,
Then maybe I would be able to take al the stress,
My whole life is a big mess.
I can't stop cutting or crying,
And no can see that I'm really trying.

I can't hold on anymore,
I've gone cold and my heart is tore.
Everyday I have to resist the gun,
Because if I pull the trigger whats done is done.
Everyday I have to be careful of my knife,
Because cutting to deep could end my life.

Even though I feel worthless and want to die,
The only reason I'm alive is because I don't want him to cry.
He's the only one that helps me out,
He is what my world is all about.
I'll love him even when my heart stops beating,
Through my terrible life he's all I'm needing.

It seems in my family no one seems to care,
Sometimes I wonder if they even want me there.
He tells me to hold on no matter what makes me mad,
He tells me to think of him when getting hits from my step-dad.
When getting slaps from my mom he told me to think of us,
He tells me not to say a word and not to cus.

Every night tears come from my eyes until he calls,
It's unbelievable that he still loves me with all my flaws.
Why does my family have to be so screwed up and hate me,
I try my best to be everything I can be.
But they only point out my mistakes and put my down,
The only facial expression they see from me is a frown.
Holding on is so hard to do,
But I'll hold on just for you.

Thats a poem that I wrote a while ago. obviously you know who its about. my dislike for kori has grown to PURE HATRED! i hope she chokes on a hot dog. or popcorn. yea, a hot dog or popcorn. you have no idea how  much i want her to DIE.

"event","i had no other idea for a subject. i hate my life so much right now. my grandma has cancer, and it might be very serious. i think its lymphoma cuz she has all the symptoms of it. the only teacher cutting me come slack is mr jensen. and miss delano a little bit, but anyway. and my friend ed is in the hospital. he was hit by a drunk driver. a 19 YEAR OLD DRUNK DRIVER. oh im pissed. i swear to god if i ever see him i will get revenge. then he'll wish he was never born. i knowim not dealing with it either, cuz i tell myself before i go to bed that its just a bad dream that im gonna wake up from. but everyday i wake up, and its not gone. i think all the mental stress is causing physical symptoms. i feel sick, my muscles are so tight it hurts to move, and i have a really bad headache all the time. plus i cant sleep. i just feel so numb, and that i havent had a chance to deal with it yet. i feel like im gonna explode on someone.

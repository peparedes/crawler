"event","Dutch began his new job tonight - manager at the TTC.  This is my first night alone in a LONG time and when you finally get time alone you think WAY TOO much.  Why is that?
 Things running through my mind: am I on the right path?  Is what I'm doing with my time meaningful?  Will the path I'm on lead to where I want it do lead?  Why do I still not have a ring?  Is it me or is it timing or is it him?  Do I need to alter myself to please him more (my appearance)?  

I'm already losing weight.  I was 162.8 and I'm now 154.7.  I had a 10 week plateau and that sucked.  I used to be 135 and muscle!  What happened?!?!  I feel like I gained a lot of my weight after I quit dancing and when I started dating Dutch (we always ate out and ate poorly).  It's my fault.  You get confortable in a situation and you let yourself go.  I want to look like I used to.  I keep wishing I had my 19 year old body back.  But you age and your body hates you.  It's been work and I'm working at it and I will succeed eventually.

I also got back in touch with a friend that I knew BD (before Dutch) and this person makes me remember how special I was and I wanted and desireable I was (still am, but this person hasn't ""seen me"" in 4 years).  But it's nice to remember old times.  AND NO ONE NEED WORRY BECAUSE I WILL NOT LEAVE DUTCH FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD OR DO ANYTHING TO COMPRIMISE OUR RELATIONSHIP!!!  I just like feeling desireable again and wanted and appreciated..."

"event","I just don't understand how some people can chronically be late!  I have several teachers at my school who just don't understand the concept of time!!  They are either 10 minutes late in picking up their classes (which either comprimises other classes or cuts my already short breaks into non-existant ones) or they are 10 minutes late in getting their class to me (I see each class 40 minutes every week, so if they are late - it cuts their lessons down).
And they ALWAYS have an excuse:  EXCUSES ARE LIKE ARMPITS - EVERY ONE HAS THEM AND THEY STINK!!
If it wasn't all the freakin time, it would be different.  BUT IT'S ALL THE TIME!!  Maybe I should play their game right back at them... but then I'd be just as bad.  I never want to be one of those that I complain about.

PS - Dutch and I are just fine now.  It was a bit messy when I confronted him, but all is very well right now.  Thank God!"

"event","I'm sad to see his family go, but it was time.  I was even moved by watching a tear leave Dutch's eye as he hugged his mom.  But it's nice to be at home, just the two of us for now.
He and I agreed that Dutch's nephew of four years was a giant pain in the ass.  And I had to remind him that he is four and is jealous of the attention his brand new brother is getting.  The new baby was pleasant and I actually took care of it for most of the visit.  Dutch's sister was more than ready to have a break from being a mom of two.  The four year old doesn't understand that you cannot be rough with a new baby.  And when you tell him to stop, it only provokes him to misbehave more.  I can tell I'm not ready for children because I was more annoyed than entertained to be with this child.  What's scary is that if anything happens to the four year old's mom, Dutch and I are technically the guardians... I don't think I like that idea right now.
 But for now, I am relieved that I don't have to keep my house clean at the moment, that I can have dirty clothes on the floor, dirty dishes in the sink, and the dog on the couch... Ah, home sweet home!"

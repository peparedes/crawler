"event","Right now we are seeing the first independant evolution of a computer virus.  In case you live under a rock, or just really really don't pay attention.  There have been cases where the Klez.h worm have been piggy backing the chernobyl virus.  The thing is is that they think that this was not intentional.  The chernobyl virus just happened to infect the kelz executable.  So effectivly we have a ""host"" carrying a ""parasite"" to infect more ""hosts"".  Except that this one came about f it's own accord.  Freaky."

"event","Let us consider for a moment the concept of rights.  I will again contend that there is no such things as inherent civil rights.  We, as humans, do not, by virtue of our ability to talk, walk and chew bubble gum at the same time, have some nebulous group of rules that must be applied to us.

What we have is, in effect, a group of ideas that pretty much everyone agrees is a good idea.  We then decide to apply these rules to everyone.  Fairly soon they become holy writ.  They become Rights.  Not based upon the merit that they may very well posses, but because <I>they deserve it</I>.

So let us assume that we all get together, and out of this chaotic meeting we come up with some good ideas (aside: You will note me using the word ideas a lot in these discussions, instead of rules or laws.  Ideas are open to change.  Rules and laws tend to be fixed in stone.  Keep in mind that nothing is perfect.  Everything must change or die).  Seems easy, no?  With a single stroke of the pen, we have set everyone free.

But wait a minute, what happens when two of these ""rights"" conflict.

The point of setting forth these ""rights"" is to make them so simple and so straight forward that they could never conflict.

Consider, for example, a case where a publication puts forth details of a politicians private life.  Does the publication have the right to say what ever it wishes about the private life of a person, as implied by the freedom of speech, or does the politician's right to privacy supercede?"

"event","I've been thinking a lot about governments lately.  The US Government in particular, but also the theories about government.  I am not going to espouse any particular party line.  More to the point I think They are all partially wrong, and partially right at the same time.  In effect each makes the mistake of limiting what they are willing to consider as Truth.  This effectively blinds they to what they seek.

But back to the topic at hand.  In any consideration of government, the first consideration  must be about the purpose of government.  The purpose of government could (and perhaps should) be distilled to a set of very simple concepts.  Consider if you will the following.  I may discuss each of these at a future time period in more detail

1. Government should construct and maintain the infrastructure.  This includes not only roads and bridges, but the phone lines, and fiber networks.

2. Government should protect us from ourselves.  People are stupid and short sited when considered as a group.  It is governments job to take the long view, and protect us from our own short sitedness

3. Government should protect us.  It is inefficient and silly for each town or state to have it's own full military.  The government should raise and arm a military for defense and offense.

4. Government should protect the rights of human beings.  In truth there is no such thing as an inalienable human right.  Every right we have must be fought for.  This is part of the governments job.

1. ECE 4514 (dital design 2) Project 2
2. ECE 4964 (Network Application design) Project 2
3. ECE 4305 (Microprocessor System design) Homework 3
4. ECE 2704 (Signals and Systems) Test 1

Now granted this is not beyond my ability.  I am a damn good programmer (humble ... me ... nah).  But of course, programming is being run by marketing, and they want to have basic functionality *right now*.

On another note, school has begun again.  I have a fairly substantial class load for all that it is only 14 credits.  11 of those credits are 4000 level courses.  Sounds like fun to me!

Well I can relax for the nonce.  My computer has up and gone splut.  It seems that my eight month old motherboard and processor have gone and dies on me (actually I expect that it is the processor, not the mother board).  This means I have to use money I don't have to replace them.  They are still under warranty, but that doesn't necessarily mean a anything.  And it is not like I can wait a long period of time to get another one.  School starts in two weeks, and I will need my computer  immediately.

"event","Has anyone noticed how bad both the movie market and the computer game market has been this year.  It seems in both cases all we get are endless remakes of yester year's hottest titles.  Instead of being innovative in what they do, it seems that all anyone wants to do is make a guaranteed buck of their already marketed line.

Of course I guess the reason they do it is because it works.  Quite a few players will go ga-ga over the next FPS or RTS game, despite the genre's lacks (plot anyone).  My attention span is not long enough when randomly blowing up things, and even the sneakier versions quickly loose their value.

Although RTS's are worse.  I loved C&C and StarCraft, but every RTS that has come out  recently are carbon clones of the ones that just xcame out.

I guess what I want is something new, something different.  Not too much different from the rest of my life eh?"

I want to learn a stringed instrument (plucked not bowed).  Guitar will do well, but harp would be better (Do you have any idea how much a floor harp costs?!?! Although I do know where I can get a *good* harp for less than normal.  Gotta love SCA contacts)

"event","Hmm Interesting <a href=""http://ww.colorquiz.com/"">test</a>.  Somewhat accurate I think.  Guess which parts ...

<lj-cut>
<b>Your Existing Situation</b>
Needs warm companionship, but is intolerant of anything short of special consideration from those close to him. If this is not forthcoming, is liable to shut himself away from them.

<b>Your Stress Sources</b>
Has an unsatisfied need to ally himself with others whose standards are as high as his own, and to stand out from the herd. This desire for preeminence isolates him and inhibits his readiness to give himself freely. While he wants to surrender and let himself go, he regards this as a weakness which must be resisted. This self-restraint, he feels, will lift him above the rank and file and ensure recognition as a unique and distinctive personality.

<b>Your Restrained Characteristics</b>
Willing to participate and to allow himself to become involved, but tries to fend off conflict and disturbance in order to reduce tension.
Unhappy at the resistance he feels whenever he tries to assert himself. However, he believes that there is little he can do and that he must make the best of the situation.

Clings to his belief that his hopes and ideas are realistic, but needs encouragement and reassurance. Applies very exacting standards to his choice of a partner and wants guarantees against loss or disappointment.

<b>Your Desired Objective</b>
Longs for a tender and sympathetic bond and for a situation of idealized harmony. Has an imperative need for tenderness and affection. Susceptible to anything esthetic.

<b>Your Actual Problem</b>
Greatly impressed by the unique, by originality, and by individuals of outstanding characteristics. Tries to emulate the characteristics he admires and to display originality in his own personality."

I think that I think in music.

There is a constant stream of music going on in my head, not any particular song or tune, just random streams of sound and music.  I work best when there is music around me.  This is not to say that I cannot think in words, or images.  Much to the contrary, I can do fun things like hold an image of a 3-D object in my mind, and rotate it.  Always though that constant stream of music is there.

When I think hard the music grows in strength.  Thinkk of it like th difference between having your sterio on as background music, and listening to a concert.  Eventually the music calms down, and I have the answer that I sought.  There are no words, or pictures.  Just a constant symphony of sound."

"event","I have discovered over the last several years of careful experimentation, that there is a nearly fool proof method of finding a relationship.  

Simply put it is to not want one.

It seems to me that as soon as someone stops looking for a relationship one tumbles into their laps.  It may have to do with that aura of desperation that surrounds someone who is constantly looking for contact.  I belive that that aura causes an unknown syndrome known as the ""Just Friends"" syndrome.  It instanly makes the person infected to ""just want to be friends"".  

So to prevent this horrid event, you must remove that aura of desperation.  The only way to do his is to convince yourself that you are happy to be single.  Once the aura is banished, a relationship will quickly and easily fall into your hands."

"event","The E.T. is surveying the Saviour's thought! They attack him with the Saviour's personal secrets , they have hindered the Saviour from fulfilling one's own duty! They let the -Saviour be unable to live! , but also they think the correct method with them, have caused greater injury to the Saviour . What I should remind here is: The Saviour is God's envoy, at the same time is to the whole human injury too to the Saviour's injury! The fact is like this too, the alien behavior has guided mankind into very more grave disaster. What behavior is the alien one to cause the human disaster? The E.T. destroyed in the future the development process, behavior injuring the Saviour caused the human disaster. The development process in the future is the biological chain, a ring among them of destruction will cause the destruction of the whole biological chain , its result is calamitous. What I need to remind is here : Though can be predicted, can change in the future, like building the dam on the river, can hold water ; Dig a irrigation canals and ditches nearby, can pilot a ship into harbour . But God's behavior does not stylize, God is intelligent, God's ability exceeds your imagination, if you think your science and technology developed , can destroy this form , can do at will , the result caused , is the same as the ancient person builds the exceedingly high tower, be sneered at by the descendant .You would pay a price for your behavior too. If you ask how to express to God that confess , then I can tell you , just Cut the E.T.s head ! Because they are really a group of shameless animals, a group of ungrateful animals! Only cut the head which puts them, could express your respect for god , could redeem your sin !"

We must not attempt to spare any generation from the brainwashing. Yet it calms the mind, it kills the soul. They know what they are doing, and the sad part is we know as well. Why? Who knows, why we are so afraid of the truth. Why do we accept that fact that men in suits control our entire world. And you if think they don't...i admire your free spirit but you will soon find the truth. The day of reckoning is upon us, our days of freedom on earth are being numbered and we must band together to fight this great evil. A great war is comming, and it will ruin all you hold dear."

"event","Well it was good while it lasted, Pastor Bogle's FM radio program on 103.5 fm was pranked relentlessly for weeks. I did everything from soundboards to outright fake prayer. Well needless to say he got Mikes number from his high tech caller ID and read it out over the air. Mike only got fuckin three calls! LMAO, on fm radio. And then the next day he called mike threatening to call the police if ANY more calls come from him. Is that even illegal..to prank a radio station? Isn't it the duty of the host and program directors to filter out bad calls etc? lol oh well. But yeah, if you want some good fun from 12-3am on weeknights...give Pastor George Bogle a call 103.5 on the FM dial. He DOSN'T have a call screener, you get RIGHT on the air and can say whatever you want!"

"event","""In a way, in our contemporary world-view, it's easy to think that science has come to take the place of God, but some philosophical problems remain as troubling as ever. Take the problem of free will; This problem has been around for a long time, since before Aristotle and 350 B.C. Saint Augustine, Saint Thomas Aquinas - these guys all worried about how we can be free if God already knows in advance everything you're gonna do. Nowadays, we know that the world operates according to some fundamental physical laws, and these laws govern the behavior of every object in the world. Now, these laws, because they're so trustworthy, they enable incredible technological achievements. But look at yourself. We're just physical systems too, right? We're just complex arrangements of carbon molecules; We're mostly water. Our behavior isn't going to be an exception to these basic physical laws, so it starts to look like whether it's God setting things up in advance and knowing everything you're gonna do, or whether it's these basic physical laws governing everything, there's not a lot of room left for freedom. So, now you might be tempted to just ignore the question, ignore the mystery of free will and say, ""Oh, well it's just a historical anecdote; It's sophomoric; It's a question with no answer,"" you know, just forget about it. But, the question keeps staring you right in the face. If you think about individuality, for example: who you are. Who you are is mostly a matter of the free choices that you make or take responsibility [for]. You can only be held responsible, you can only be found guilty, you can only be admired or respected, for things you did of your own free will. So the question keeps coming back and we don't really have a solution to it. It starts to look like all your decisions are really just a charade. Think about how it happens; There's some electrical activity in your brain, your neurons fire, they send a signal down into your nervous system, it passes along down into your muscle fibers, they twitch, and you might, say, reach out your arm. It looks like it's a free action on your part, but every one of those, every part of that process, is actually governed by physical law: chemical laws, electrical laws, and so on. So, now it starts to looks like the Big Bang set up the initial conditions, and the whole rest of our history, the whole rest of human history and even before, is really just sort of the playing out of sub-atomic particles according to these basic fundamental physical laws. We think we're special, we think we have some kind of special dignity. But, that now comes under threat, I mean, that's really challenged by this picture. 

So, you might be saying, ""Well wait a minute, what about quantum mechanics? I know enough contemporary physical theory to know it's not really like that. It's really a probabilistic theory; There's room; It's loose; It's not deterministic, and that's going to enable us to understand free will."" But, if you look at the details, it's not really going to help because, what happens is, you have some very small quantum particles, and their behavior is, apparently, a bit random; They sort of swerve. Their behavior is absurd, in the sense that it's unpredictable and we can't understand it based on anything that came before. It just does something out of the blue according to a probabilistic framework. But, is that going to help with freedom? I mean, should our freedom just be a matter of probabilities, just some random swerving in a chaotic system? That starts to seem like it's worse. I'd rather be a gear in a big deterministic physical machine than just some random swerving. 

So, we can't just ignore the problem. We have to find room in our contemporary world-view for persons, with all that that entails. Not just bodies, but persons. And, that means trying to solve the problem of freedom, finding room for choice and responsibility, and trying to understand individuality.""

"event","""You can't fight city hall. Death and taxes. Don't talk about politics or religion. This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line. Lay down G.I.! Lay down G.I.! We saw it all through the 20th century, and now, in the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze. We should not submit to de-humanization. I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world. I'm concerned with the structure. I'm concerned with the systems of control: those that control my life, and those that seek to control it even more. I want freedom, that's what I want! And that's what you should want! It's up to each and every one of us to turn loose and just suck up the greed, the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities, because that is the central mode of control; Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny. We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale. Start challenging this corporate slave-state. The 21st century is going to be a new century, not the century of slavery, not the century of lies and issues of no significance, and classism and statism, and all the rest of the modes of control. It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure, and something right. What a bunch of garbage: liberal, democrat, conservative, republican. It's all there to control you! Two sides of the same coin. Two management teams bidding for control, the CEO job, of Slavery Inc.! The truth is out there in front of you, but they lay out this buffet of lies. I'm sick of it and I'm not going to take a bite out of it, do you got me?! Resistance is not futile, we're gonna win this thing, humankind is too good, we're not a bunch of under-achievers! We're gonna stand up, and we're gonna be human beings. We're going to get fired up about the real things, the things that matter: creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit. Well, that's it, that's all I got to say. The ball's in your court.""

And this... this is like my little window to the world, and every minute is a different show. Now I may not understand it, I may not even necessarily agree with it, but I tell you what, I accept it and just sorta glide along. You want to keep things on an even keel, I guess is what I'm saying. You want to go with the flow, the sea refuses no river. The idea is to remain in a state of constant departure, while always arriving. It saves on introductions and goodbyes.

The ride does not require an explanation, just occupants. That's where you guys come in. It's like you come onto this planet with a crayon box.

Don't worry about drawing within the lines, or coloring outside the lines. I say color outside the lines, you know what I mean? Color right off the page. Don't box me in!

"event","monday nite @ the century:

- it seriously took 20 minutes to parallel park the beamer. how embarrassing!
- erika paid my admission, for my drinks, & slipped spending money into my pocket.
- i saw/talked to michael for the first time in maybe a month & a half. my heart really sunk at first [i didnt want to have to think abt him]. but i guess it was ok.
- trying to take full advantage of the dollar draft, i beat the previous weeks record of 3 beers in an hour with 4 beers in 45 minutes. my mom would be proud. and that, my friends, is also why boys dont like me.

tuesday nite @ 80s nite, my complaints:

- while i managed to spend all of my money on beer, i didnt even get drunk. stop & think to yourselves the last time you went to 80s nite & werent wasted [if there was ever a case] & how different & sucky it was.
- packed like sardines, the sweat of hundreds of people was getting on me. <bold>THAT IS FUCKING DISGUSTING!</bold>
- all you 80s nite drunks are all talk & this girl still gets no love.

conclusions:
- i am straight with club hell in every possible way.
- i prefer to frequent 21 plus establishments. call me a snob.

ted invited me to his party last nite but mike didnt go & i didnt want to go alone. ah well. i spent the day with erika instead.

which brings us up to date. today, the fourth. erika is dragging me to some shitty party all the way in worcestor that i cant imagine actually having a good time at. holidays bum me out. no fireworks. no kisses. no keg. [but believe it or not, i dont even feel like drinking]. & my cat keeps biting me."

"event","this weekend when i went to my moms house, she called me a ""spinster"" and said i had a ""delayed reaction"". my MOMS said that shit, yo. she also bought me a big 96 oz. bucket of margarita mix: just add tequilla. that made my day to say the very least!

then i went to corianders party. i sure know how to work a room. i had a pretty fun time. i didnt remember coming home when i woke up this morning. i just prayed that i gave jay a ride home instead of leaving him there. im pretty sure i did.

oh oh! when i came home i had a message from michael on my machine. most interesting. we havent talked in weeks now. it cut him off rather quickly. he said something like "" i dont know.. its me again... i know some shitty things were said... BEEP"".

tomorrow nite i hope to go to the century lounge to see akrobatik. 

my mission on tuesday is to go to 80s nite with not a dollar to my name, but get wasted & have fun. [a precursor for the pimp contest going down between mike & i]. so, molly, if youre reading, i would like to take you up on your offer to hone my 'buy-me-a-drink' skills. [hone!] i never go to 80s nite anymore. i better end up having a good time or i probably wont go again. ill see you all there & talk to yr faces.

my cat is a real freak [but oh so soft & furry] who just sits there & stares at the floor/ corners. there is nothing there & i dont know what hes looking at! he doesnt give up on that shit, either. its seriously abnormal."

after running some errands, my car decided not to start. i sweated like a pig in the hot sun waiting for someone to pick me up & that sucked.

erika eventually picked me up & we decided to get wasted on our limited budget. she is losing her liscense tomorrow because of too many speeding tickets. on the way home from the liquor store she got pulled over & got another ticket. that was tense.

my forty was skunkified. thats a dissapointement! fucken a! that aint the first time, dear economy liquors.

all of my ladies came over tonite. many beers later we had a madonna [etc] dance party & that was sweet. [including beers jen labrie & i ventured to the store to get. we heard 'janies got a gun' by aerosmith on the way back & saw some kid with a pillow on his head. also brought lollipops- thanx to yrs truly] i needed that, lemme tell ya. it was nice to meet you daidra, & for the record i dont wanna fite you! highlights include molly on her knees with a cross. unfortunetly, it didnt pick up on video.

my girls are the best & fuck a michael, eh? ill shake my thang in the jean outfit till the break-a.  

it is now 2.11 am & i think maybe andi is coming back?? even though i guess now im kinda tired. ive got to wake up early & go to the gym to work off my weeks worth of budweiser.

my sisters wedding is tomorrow. tonite is rehersal/ dinner [the only good thing i can say abt that is scorpion bowls]. i have to wear an ugly silver dress that costs way more money than i have to spend on a dress ill never wear again unless someone invites me to the prom. not to mention when my moms picked it up from the place it had oil spots all over it. the dress is accompanied by what i refer to as stripper shoes. and speaking of... erika was supposed to be my date but she has to work instead. i do look forward to kicking back a few with my pops, though. it ought to be an interesting weekend.

last nite i had a dream that we were at my parents old house & my sister was out in back and someone 'accidentally' shot & killed her. rite before her wedding. i tweaked out my whole entire dream [this includes avenging the fuck out of her death]. then in my dream i woke up & was thinking abt my dream but was still dreaming. it was awful.

all these fucking boys with girlfriends keep calling my house. its out of control. ...always the wrong people....

school is going well. im doing my best to be a good student [& am succeeding]. there is a boy in my class whos top lip i like. id like to smoke with him. [all the cute boys go during the day]. im taking my first test on monday. $five bux for every A- holla at me.

i went on a sort-of date this weekend. it was weird. i was drunk before we got there. i guess i made him feel bad, which isnt something i wanted to do. i dont remember much.

then i went to the city of boston to see none other than toby brown. god, why is toby brown thee nicest? we went to the border cafe & then to the bar. apparently the city of boston is making up for lost time with me. as a side note, ive been exercising & loosing weight & looking cute.

im also cleaning peeps dirty ass apartments for a little cash on the side. its a really big help. so thats co'.

& my twenty-first birthday is in a couple of weeks. im excited. itll be cooler because i wont be made to feel like a little kid. im saying that i wont drink more than i already do now. mainly because i feel like there are better things i could do with my money. as a side note, no matter how cheap & how drunk it gets me, i really need to learn to stay away from natural ice. what am i thinking?! erika apparently has the day planned. she wont tell me much except she is being $300, $30 of which will be in ones for when we go to the strip club. & that shes going to get me a lapdance. yeehaw. im not, however, looking forward to the hangover i know ill have. thats why ive decided to just be drunk all weekend & deal with the hangover later. you only turn 21 once, rite?

it was hella warm out today & i wanted to go to the park to watch the sunset but i didnt have anyone to go with & i knew if i went alone it would be awkward and totally depressing. 

its funny because i feel like things in my life are really starting to come together. but im lonely as a motherfucker. i want to be beautiful & important to someone. i want someone to bring me a glass of water & rub my tummy when i have a hangover.

its mating season for cats. poor little guy. hes a ball of hormones. but hes been extra nice & lovey & cuddly lately. maybe cos i havent been home much. ill take it where i can get it."

also yesterday the anticon cd i ordered came in. ive been waiting like a little kid for the mail everyday. it wont play in either of my two cd players. just my luck, eh? i called the peeps and they said i can exchange it. i dont know whether to get another cd & hope it works [because if i had to send that back id feel like a pain in the arse] or get the 10"" which i know will work but wont have the extra track. :(

blackalicious is friday. i want to go very badly. i think itll be somewhat of a small miracle if if works out.

finally. the new mitsubishi eclipse commercial. i love it. im glad its on constantly. i like the song they play in it [does anyone know who its by??] & i love the girl. i like the way she dances and the face she makes like ""whoa, i can do that? yeah, i guess i can. thats cool."""

"event","wednesday morning: its always interesting trying to piece together the events of the previous nite. its like im a detective & my life is a fucking crime scene.

i know someone has put me to bed. my bra is on but pants are off. if i was functional enough to remove clothing to go to sleep, id probably take my bra off, too. the fancy [fancier] pillows are still on the bed and i dont sleep with those. there is also stuff on the chair my cat sleeps on & i dont put stuff on that chair: a unicorn stuffed animal, a sweatshirt, a silk bathrobe [not that the detail is relevant, but i think it adds color. i find it amusing, in these circumstances. i dont have the balls to write 'silk kimono'  in my livejournal, although it would be cooler if i did] and a bag containing new bras i ordered from victorias secret. [as a side note: i think they are all a success. working a new bra into my life needs to be a gradual thing for me, but i think itll go ok.]  instead of my cat sleeping on the chair he is a brave little soldier beside me, keeping vigil as i sleep. id like to think he senses somethings off and hes concerned. in reality i think hes just there because theres shit on his chair. 

i called motta when i woke up to apologize. its like a ritual for me. get outrageous, pass out, call to apologize. [""i wont say im going to stop drinking because i wont and really dont want to yet but i need to stop getting ridiculous""] i also called to find out what the heck went on. she was laughing, so that made me feel better. i hate having to babysit people when they drink. i hate it even more when i put people in the position where the have to babysit me. it happens on occasion. that was probably the most needed occasion to date. 

god, im kinda glad i was too drunk to find my other pals there. i will call jen later once i know shes awake and has done her workout to apologize and get the scoop from her.


new england tech called me today. i want to go there. my brother gave me a motivational talk of sorts. hes not the 'opening up' type but he told me theres ""nothing more depressing"" than watching me do nothing with myself & my intelligence. he says he went down the wrong road, a road im headed down, and now his choices have been made and thats the way it is. everything he said to me made a lot of sense. even if im not so happy doing it, im not so happy now about sitting around trying to figure out what to do. i have dreams of buying a house and being able to send my parents on vacation. 

dont let this buying a house stuff fool you. i dont know. it hasnt fooled me. im not buying in, but i figure if we all have to play the game theres no fucking punk rock rule that says i cant go all out. [& fuck it if there was.] after you stop and think about it, its amazing to think that when people are held back or stopped or limited or dont do what they would like, what they could, its almost always themselves thats the only thing standing in the way.

[yes, i am in therapy- STILL. haha. as i write this i am coincidentally talking to joseph about trees & tree climbing and how ive never climbed one. something in my brain. that stopping myself thing. as stacy says, im sure theres some dmh for it. is it dmh?? i dont even know? the book the mental health professionals use to diagnose.]

but anyway. new england tech called me today because i filled some form out online. i didnt recognize the voice and they called me by first and last name, so i said ""shes not in"". once i found out it was new england tech i had to convince her to try calling back in an hour or so and not on monday, which is when she said she probably would. i couldnt admit that i lied and was really me. its like an sienfeld. i have an appointment tomorrow and im excited! i think thats weird, and weird for me, but im still excited. 


upyrmanifesto: rita came over last nite and she wanted a snack so fixed her focaccia and dipping sauce.
upyrmanifesto: eating focaccia & dipping sauce, in my kitchen with rita lecuyer. it gives me the giggles.
<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~gounnoticed"">gounnoticed</a>:hahahah
upyrmanifesto: lindsey said when they came back here to tuck me in i kept calling rita 'lindsey lecuyer' and laughing

"event","do you guys know about this? i got an instant message today: 'you have recieved an instakiss click here' so i did [after making sure the link wasnt to some porn site]. if i have a secret admirer out there, i am in no position to ignore this instakiss. it could be the man of my dreams, for godsakes.

-smack! you have just been kisses be a secret admirer! their first name starts with a letter between j and r !-

is this designed to be some cruel joke to single dorks like myself? was i selected at random to receive this and forever be tormented by anonymity? or worse- did a friend who knows im a dork send me this in pity? 

i added a link to my livejournal in my aol profile because i want the sender to read and see my loser torment. i also figured if they are obsessive like me [im refraining from the word 'stalker' because im not creepy. just bored & hopeless] they would probably like to read anyhow.

i stayed home like a loser tonite and didnt get ONE phone call from someone to see what i was up to. cool. i hope everybody reading feels shitty.  i wanted to quilt but after like over 2 hrs of cutting fucking fabric my neck reached maximum kink capacity for the day.

erik informed me that the financial aide deadline is march first. i thought it was may. wasnt it may last year? so if its march first, and today is already february 23rd, doesnt that mean id be filing pretty late? UNG!! im not mentally prepared for fucking fafsa. god, ive only known this for maybe ten minutes now and im already in total disarray.

and speaking of disarray... i got a letter in the mail today saying that my health insurance is changing & really soon they will no longer cover fillings, root canals, or cleanings. wee! all this after i just made an extremely long overdue appointment. ung!! ill probably just eat more candy until all of my teeth rot out of my head and then i wont have to worry about it.

im reading 'waiting for my cats to die' by stacy horn. we are the same in a lot of ways, except she really has a grasp & understanding of her weirdness. she explains it all very rationally. she is like my fucked-up mentor. peep this:

there is a joke that goes: cats are a lonely womans excuse to talk to herself. wonderful. theres some truth to this but, really, what have i got to be ashamed of? i love my cats. they make me happy. cleveland amory talked to his cat. but cleveland amory had a bit of that crotchety-old-bachelor thing going, and its okay for crotchety old bachelors to fall in love with their cats. and its okay for gay men. if a straight man my age talked to his cats, he would be considered charming. why do they get to be charming, and me (and all women) pathetic?

but the whole book is great & you should read it even if youre not into the cat thing.

its nearly six o clock now. i cant watch the golden girls because its on cable & i no longer have cable. will i ever really start this day? probably not- i could ignore it better that way. 

--wednesday--
-fill the cats food dish
-look for cutting mat & hopefully quilt
-lift weights & tae bo!
-bras: buy 'em!
-online: check out echonyc & stacy..., look for michael jackson stuff on ebay, visit sarahs diaryland [syncopate.diaryland.com]"

i guess thats as good as any to be. pissed off, out numbered, & headaches are my thing. 

i just found out that in reality its a week earlier than i thought it was. thats a bummer because i had plans to buy records & illegal substances & now they must wait.

i dropped michael off at the bus today. im not one to get into robot talk- i think the joke is played- but he has switches like flick flick flick. 

ive been hanging out with jen & lindsey & its cool. except they are no longer going to eighties nite tonite. i personally would rather take some sleeping pills then spend more money on beer but lindsay i. is going & i want to make out- hang out. haha. probably another nite where i could be having a lot more fun but for some reason i wont be."

tonite christian came over & smoked with me & i didnt really get high. now its 12.44 am & im hungry because ive only eaten once today but i dont want to eat this late because i worry i will be able to HEAR my fat & im trying to look like britney for when i meet the man of my dreams [you know, the one -without- the girlfriend].

ahahahhhhhhhhhhhhhhahahahahaha - [interpreted as a laugh or scream].

"event","tomorrow is the big day. v-day. d-day. i havent really given it thought until now, but i think tomorrow ill probably get sad/ bummed out/ cry. ive been really emotional lately. 

facts that seem redeeming but make things worse:

""i could always get drunk tomorrow""
-the truth is i will like 99% be getting drunk alone because ill make plans to get drunk with my ladies but it wont pull through.

""i will do a special valentines day dedication to my cat""
-stephanie, you KNOW this whole cat thing is getting really weird & creepy.

""maybe ill get a super surprizer valentine from Mr. Right.""
- LIVE IN THE NOW SISTER.

and since this is the valentines day edition, i shall share the results of the chinese horoscope email forward my sister sent. you know, the ones where you fill in all yr answers & dont look ahead & at the end it tell you what your answers mean. ready?



the one i love........
my answer was michael. um.................


my lucky star
i said my dad. isnt that so sweet?

the song i named thats supposed to go with michael is 'jesses girl'. hmph.loosely interpreted, i can see it. i did always want to sleep with jon gorman.

'crazy on you' by heart
goes with ben & harry. i cheated & named two because i didnt know which one came to me first. but i really did go crazy on harry... in the mental breakdown sense of the word.

the song that tells most about my state of mind is 'more than a feeling'

& 'show me the way' expresses how i feel about life in general.

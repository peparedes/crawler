"event","hey everyone, its me again. Just updateing, you know, the usual. Any who, because im more comfy with what happened, i'll tell you all....
   It all started on that day that all the hispanics were staying home to protest. I had already been going out with Andres for 5 months, and he stayed home while I went to school. I got there early like i do everyday, and sat my stuff down to wait for my friends and a call from papi. Now i see chris walk by to where he waits for his friends sometimes, but I never really say anything to him, just an eyebrow gesture or a nod. But today was wierd. He came up to me and handed me a paper as casey was walking into school. He said ""read it when you're alone."" as soon as he left i said ""pfft, like hell."" and opened it. as soon as I saw the picture my older sister drew when he and I were going out, I bawled, casey was there so I calmed down a bit(thank you Miz Katz!!!). I read half of the note that was next to the pic and bawled even more. Thats when i couldnt take it anymore, and decided to call papi myself. I was crying on the phone and when I told him what had happened he sighed and kept on saying that he knew something like this was going to happen. So, he calmed me down and when i hung up with him i was able to read the rest of the note. i put it away to give to papi later and picked up my stuff to go to first period. That day went smoother as it went by but i couldnt stay next to chris. I was alittle afraid of him to tell you the truth. I told chris that he'd get his answer tomorrow. and he did, papi took the note the next day and read it. He put it in his pocket and said ""ok, he's definatly going to get his answer today."" and then we went to first period. The day went ok, no sign of chris untill lunch. He was standing alittle ways in front of me in the line for food. He hadnt seen me. Papi called me because he got out of fourth period to come see me and then talk to chris. I told him that i was in line and chris was in line in front of me and he said ""good. I'll be there in a bit"" and hungup. He found me and saw chris. He asked chris to talk to him and pulled me out of line. Heres the conversation, it might be alittle shakey with my bad memory and all :

andres: ok chris, you wanted her answer right?

chris: what?

andres: her answer? the one for the note. ::pulls out note:: you wanted her answer right? well here it is, tell him mami.

nikki: ok, im going to be the bitch here and say it straight...I wouldnt date you again in a million fucking years. All the shit you put me through hurt like a bitch.

chris: ::nodd:: ok...

andres: you heard her. and you better respect that decision, because if you dont, i'll make you respect it.

chris: naw man its cool. It was just something I felt like I had to do.

Andres: I respect that man, but I gotta tell you something, I'd do anything for her. i love her very much-

chris: I see that man...

andres: -And i would support her no matter what she chose, but the last thing I'd want would be for her to get hurt

chris: :;nod:: i respect that man, i just felt like it was somehting I had to do.

andres: ok man, I respect that, and i hope you respect her and her decision.

chris: I do man, I do.

andres: ok dude. well, thank you for your time.

and just like that we left. I was so friggin happy!! I told chris like it was!!! ^-^ yaaay!! go nikki-go nikki its ya birthday-its ya birthday!! it felt like everything was lifted off my shoulders. I gave papi a kiss and thanked him over and over again. I love my osito so much! he ended up tearing up the note and throwing it away. everything went back to normal after a few days and I was extatic! I couldnt have been happier and amazingly, my papi makes me happier and more in love with him everyday. :;sigh:: i hope someday all the things we plan will come true. Though fairytales dont exist, I would like an ending that gose something like...""and they lived happily ever after."" that would make all the shit i've ever been through worth it. well, I've said buckets full so I think its time to go. I'll be on maybe tomorrow. Luv ya alls!!!!! MUAH!!!

!@#$%Nikki%$#@!

P.S.
Nikki is in her time of the month and will probably not be on much due to PMSyness...so yea....Luv ya guys! <3"

"event","Sry i havent been in much lately. I've been super busy. Staying after school and junk for this stupid play that everyone knows is gonna be a complete flunk cuz no ones ready. Oh! And today while me and my friends Lauren and Casey were waiting in the hallway next to the auditorium for our cue into the scene, the bellrings and this kid who looks like a 7th grader walks out and sprays TAG on himself right in front of us. We all get really hot and hyper all of a sudden and we start laughing when we realize what was happening. My other friend Brett walks in and says ""who sprayed AXE?"" we say ""No one, this little kid sprayed TAG on himself, and now we're starting to feel the affect."" Then lauren starts to hit on him and me and casey shake our heads as we walk in on our cue. Casey Got the air conditioning while me and Lauren got the back of the stage where there is very little air(hot as hell). I felt hot for like 3 or 4 more hours. I have completely cooled off, thank God! It felt so wired. well gladly Im in love with chris so im happy =) I told him if he ever used that stuff I'd kill him. I hate feeling warm in the day time. I like feeling really cold and at night is when i like any heat what so ever. It really depends. And the 8th dance, b4 i forget, it was soooooooo awsome! You guys should have seen us. Our group didnt stop dancing unless to get a drink. My legs hurt and so do my arms. i felt so surprised that i danced in public and wasnt humiliated! ::GASP!:: rofl!!! :P anywho! This Girl named alyssa, she saw us danceing all together, like the girls with the girls(not alot of guys to dance with or that we wanted to dance with) cuz they're our friends and she calls us lesbians. Then the whole ballroom starts talking thinking we're lesbians. so at skool we were ready to kick her ass and we cant find her. I should have gotten her with the cake at the dance. Everyone stopped our friend eeves from doing it. He tried to put gum in her hair but kept missing ::snaps fingers:: Damn! O well. We'll get her b4 skool ends. That I promise myself! lol. well I'll stop talking for right now. Dinners ready. TTYL! Muah! Luv you all! ^^

If she ever will! Shes always negitive towards herself...o well! My dad put in 2o dollars cause we managed to clear some of the house with the garage sale. BUT DUDE!!!!! IT WAS HOT!

"event","Thurs.
I had a good time at my Bf's house. It was comfier then sleeping in my rock for a bed. Though I realy cant help but think and feel that there is something wrong with my Bf. After like the first day we sat in her room playing ""YHATTZE!"" and I felt big vibes. Though I'm not so sure what type of vibes I felt. But they felt horrible. But on the last day thoses vibes kinda lifted. I could still feel them, just not as much. We played some board games. And had fun for the last couple of minuites we had left with each other for the day. And them I went home. I had the tackle of my life! curtosy of my lil bro and lil sis. Also by my dog Rosie. I didn't know that I'd be missed so much. Though I have to say my mom sure as hell didn't miss me a bit. As soon as she got home, sure enough, all hell broke loose. She yelled at me to clean up, and wash the dishes, and put away the clothes, and to clean up my room, and basicly I had no rest or break cause while I was gone no one had enough common sense to do my chores for me. I sometimes think that my sibs aren't as smart or perfect as my mom thinks they are. Not to mention that she also believes that we should be godly children and always be perfect in every way! Especialy in school. A perfect example is when I was in 2nd grade, I tripped in P.E. and scrapped my entire shin. It was bloody and sticky and all the coach did was wipe it up with a paper towel and send me home. I missed a test that day cause I was sent home and when I got home my mom was already there. She asked how I did on the test and I told her ""Im sorry mommy but I missed it. I'm sure I can make it up tommarrow."" My mom flipped. She said that if I were to get any where in life I would have to take the test on time and on the day its given. Mind you my shin was now dripping in blood. she looked at it and told me to take a bath and get some bandades. I felt lower then worms that day. I was always pionting for makeing my mom happy. I never did make mom happy. Or proud. I really hope in the future I can though.

Fri.
I have no comment on today..."

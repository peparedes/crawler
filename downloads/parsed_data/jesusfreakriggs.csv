I've done a horrible job and 
now know You can do better.
I've gotta stop with my excuses
I make and start acting on 
things I can do. 
Allow me to enjoy the gift 
of life You've given to me and be
grateful for what You've given me, 
instead of being ungrateful for
what I dont have that I want.

struggling to find my feet
i have no other place to go
my mind is filled all day
with simple pains and fears

i can only look to You
and pray to persevere.
because it is not mine,
but Yours that will be done.

stumbling on my path
its hard to walk toward You
my desires are far off
and i have only You

it shoudl be easier,
 should be my desire
but i am selfish 
and become reluctant.
i feel myself tire 
      from this journey.

i drop to my knees
 i have nothing left
i look to You for hope
and I remember what you said.

""I am the way, truth and life.""
only my heart is calmed.
my mind races to its own end.

"event","People come into your life for a Reason, a Season or a Lifetime. When you know which one it is, you will know what to do for that person. When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend, and they are! They are there for the reason you need them to be.

Then, without any wrongdoing on your part, or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered, and now it is time to move on.

Some people come into your life for a SEASON, because your turn has come
to share, grow, or learn. They bring you an experience of peace, or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it! It is real! But, only for a season.

LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons: things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.


i'd like to look at all the people in my life and try to figure out the lifetime ones

it's been a really good visit. i spent a little more time online then I had hoped to, but what can i do. i did read a lot.
here's some of my favorite quotes from the new book i'm reading.
Imitation of Christ.

""Do with me what You know to be beset, as pleases You best and as will best promote Your glory. Put me where You will and freely do with me in all things according to Your will."" Book 3 Chap. 15 Paragraph 2

""Christ: Try, my child, to do the will of anothr rather than your own. Always choose to have fewer riches rather than more. Always seek the lowest palce and desire to be subject to all. Always wish for and pray that the will of God be accomplished in you. Such a person enters into the abode of true peace and inward rest.""  Book 3 Chap. 23 Paragraph 3

i'll finsih this and start ""The Dante Club"" and probably finish it on the drive up as well. Bye.

I'm reading Imitation of Christ now. 
Here are 2 of my favorite quotes so far. I'm less than 1/4 into this book, it's amazing.

Get up; now is the time to begin! Say to yourself: ""Now is the time for good works, now is the time to fight, now is the time to make reparation for the sins of the past.""

""It is good that everything is not always to our liking; for adversity makes peopel look into their hearts in order to realize that they are exiles and must not put their hopes in any worldly thing."""

refrain:
i've lost all faith
   in the words you say,
  broken my trust,
 i'm slapped in the face.

all you've ever said
    loses all its value
 now i'm the one who's
   standing alone, without you.
lost, confused at how you
    could do all this
feeling nothing but regret and pain
  wondering if its me, you miss.

i've got nothing inside 
   and nothing to hold onto
wanting to disappear
  and just forget you
 i'm so hurt and broken
completely lost inside
no one is gettin in
   behind myself i'll hide

rejection, anger, fear
  seep into the soul,
you've left me wounded,
  with a gaping hole,
i've been spiteful but now
      i know its not my loss
 now that its finally over
all i'm left with is my cross

so i say goodbye(i'm done)
  last time i step to the plate
the damage is done, scars will form
    nothing can be fixed,
 because it's too late.

"event","i started to read Love and Responsibility a simplified version by Monsignor Walsh from Philly, and i'm about half way thruogh and love it, and wish i'd read it earlier in my life. I'm reading the simplified version first so maybe i can catch some of the stuff in the full version. remember i'm not a very smart guy.
here is perhaps my favorite part...and where the book gets its name from..i'm guessing...

These are the words in teh book that I am reading and do not know if they are the words in the original work.
""Love demands a responsibility for this other person who has been drawn into the closest possible relationship, becoming even the property of the subject. Each person has a responsibility for their own love, being sure that their love is mature enough to justify the trust of the other person.""

""Only when tested, can love be shown as true.""

""To desire the unlimited good for the other is really to desire God for them.""

i'll be putting some of my own thoughts and reflections and writings up later about this and other stuff.

FOUND THIS ON TOM'S JOURNAL...It's alright, thought I'd put it on with the Love and Responsibility thing...yea..
What is love? 
When we claim that it's love that we have for someone, are we correct? 

Something to ponder upon..... 

Are your palms sweaty, is your heart racing and is your voice caught within your chest? 
It isn't love, it's LIKE. 

You can't keep your eyes or hands off of them, am I right?
It isn't love, it's LUST.

Are you proud, and eager to show them off? 
It isn't love, it's LUCK. 

Do you want them because you know they're there? 
It isn't love, it's LONELINESS. 

Are you there because it's what everyone wants? 
It isn't love, it's LOYALTY. 

Are you there because they kissed you, or held your hand? 
It isn't love, it's LOW CONFIDENCE. 

Do you stay for their confessions of love, because you don't want to hurt them? 
It isn't love, it's PITY. 

Do you belong to them because their sight makes your heart skip a beat? 
It isn't love, it's INFATUATION. 

Do you pardon their faults because you care about them? 
It isn't love, it's FRIENDSHIP. 

Do you tell them every day they are the only one you think of? 
It isn't love, it's a LIE. 

Are you willing to give all of your favorite things away for their sake? 
It isn't love,it's CHARITY. 

Does your heart ache and break when they're sad? 
Then it's LOVE. 

Do you cry for their pain, even when they're strong? 
Then it's LOVE. 

Do their eyes see your true heart, and touch your soul so deeply it hurts? 
Then it's LOVE. 

Do you stay because a blinding, incomprehensible mix of pain and relation pulls you close and holds you there? 
Then it's LOVE. 

Do you accept their faults because they're a part of who they are? 
Then it's LOVE. 

Are you attracted to others, but stay with them faithfully without regret? 
Then it's LOVE. 

Would you allow them to leave you not because they want to but because they have to? 
Then its LOVE.



Would you give them your heart, your life, your death? 
Then it's LOVE. 


Now, if love is painful, and tortures us so, why do we love? 
Why is it all we search for in life? 
This pain, this agony? 
Why is it all we long for? 
This torture, this powerful death of self? 
Why? 
The answer is so simple cause it's...LOVE. 
It is such an addictive thing that even people who are not having it wish to experience and share it with"

<b><u>Numb</b></u>

I'm tired of being what you want me to be 
feeling so faithless 
lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
put under the pressure 
of walking in your shoes 

[caught in the undertow / just caught in the undertow]
every step that I take is another mistake to you 
[caught in the undertow / just caught in the undertow]

I've
become so numb
I can't feel you there
become so tired
so much more aware
I'm becoming this
all I want to do
is be more like me
and be less like you 

can't you see that you're smothering me
holding too tightly 
afraid to lose control
cause everything that you thought I would be
has fallen apart right in front of you 

[caught in the undertow / just caught in the undertow]
every step that I take is another mistake to you
[caught in the undertow / just caught in the undertow]
and every second I waste is more than I can take 

I've
become so numb
I can't feel you there
become so tired
so much more aware
I'm becoming this
all I want to do
is be more like me
and be less like you 

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've
become so numb
I can't feel you there
become so tired
so much more aware
I'm becoming this
all I want to do
is be more like me
and be less like you 

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Is everything what you want me to be
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Is everything what you want me to be"

"event","""my immortal
i'm so tired of being here
suppressed by all of my childish fears
and if you have to leave
i wish that you would just leave
because your presence still lingers here
and it won't leave me alone 

these wounds won't seem to heal
this pain is just too real
there's just too much that time cannot erase

when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears
when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears
and i've held your hand through all of these years
but you still have all of me

you used to captivate me
by your resonating light
but now i'm bound by the life you left behind
your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
your voice it chased away all the sanity in me""

the last few weeks have been great...alright so maybe i'm being sarcastic as usual. i went to Philly to go to a charismatic prayer meeting on Wednesday and it was nice, but there's still something missing. I dont know, i feel like there are 10 different people inside me trying to get me to do so many different things. im working my website again, and i have to start working on a paper for class. well thats it for now. its funny how i thought i knew...

I know you guys have it in you....meanig my friends from Long Island, they all fell off the face of the earth. Things just keep getting more confusing. (BACK UP) Well confusing and better I guess. The wedding is in 10 days. I can't wait because I get to go pick up my friend Erin from Jersey and visit a good friend ;p. haha. Then the wedding is going to rock house. Then I am on vacation in Jersey! CRAZY! Well anything is better than Long Island right now. It's so depressing how everyone has grown apart except for like 3 people. It's just boring and blah! I am doing good though. I can't complain. My dad is starting with crap because he's getting stressed with the wedding so say some prayers thanks. I hope you all have a blessed night. DOES THIS SOUND FUNNY?! I HATE YOU! [ITS A JOKE]
here's an idea....read...Matthew 6:25-34...and you can understand the reason for my worry-free life. DUH! God is good all the time."

No offense to those at home because these people aren't like you either. I'm going to miss a few of those seniors who aren't coming back. Finals were alright...I mean I bet studying would help. I will find out how I did in a few weeks. Dad's wedding is coming up, bringing my friend from Jersey. She's pretty cool ;-) I haven't been hanging out with a few of the people I wish I could spend more time with, but it's the roll of the dice (and no not those dice karen or robin) Well summer here I come...well not really...after the Physics final @ 8am tomorrow MY LIFE IS FREE <font size=2>well at least for 3 months and school...but not work</font>"

Saturday Night I hung out with Erin, Erin, KSue, Ed, Robin, and Seth. We went to Kosi's and then hung out at the House for a bit. Then Sunday night hung out with Seth, Erin, and KSue. Last Night We did Stations of the Cross...it was nice but could have used some projecting readers... :-/ , anyway I then hung out with Melissa and we watched Aladdin...that movie is timeless. I had a great time. Today was confession and then on to house mass later and I will write more then. Until Then YES! LORD! AMEN! GOOD GOOD STUFF.....JESUS CHRISTO IS GREAT!"

"event","So my brother is gone and I hate it. I thought that I wouldn't miss him until like 2 weeks was up. But now I am basically crying and crying maybe even a river. I already miss him and he has been gone like 5 minutes. I think that maybe thinking about me going to middle school rather than Stephen going to college like 4 hours away will take my mind off the sadness. So here goes. I can't wait until I go to an ice cream social. That is where you learn what team your on and who is on your team. So basically you eat ice cream and socialize with the people on your team. I hope that one of my friends is at least in my AA. Ok, I really miss him it is just so hard not to think about. Well, now I am done."

"event","I haven't written in forever and I am so really very sorry. It's just that I have been so busy. Ok not very busy but when I have no one to play with or talk to I just forgot about live journal. So now I am going to write a story but a very short story. Here it is:

BE YOURSELF 
There once was a girl who was always good to everyone. Her name was Lila. One day she was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Of course, she didn't get into trouble because every one didn't believe that it was true since she was so responsible. A few weeks later she decided she didn't want to be known as a goody good. She decided that she would get caught doing the unthinkable for her. The only problem was she had no idea what she would get caught doing. Finally, she thought of what she would do she would hang out with someone she had been specifically told not to hang out with. Kim. the next day she started hanging out with Kim hoping someone she knew would show up and spread the word that she was hanging out with Kim. After all, she was doing some pretty bad stuff. After what seemed like days, Lila's aunt showed up. She saw and she walked on by. That night Lila's aunt came over to talk to her. After about 2 hours, Lila and her aunt were done talking and Lila promised to never do anything bad again and would be herself because that was who she was best at being at.

Hope you enjoyed the story."

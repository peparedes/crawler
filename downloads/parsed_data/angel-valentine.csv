"event","Hey, this is Brooke, Raven left the room to pee so here I am to write on her journal, tell the world all her secrets.

Really, she's a great girl.  I fucking love her and she knows it.  But she loves me just as much so it's good.  She's very witty and funny.  And loves to be cuddled.  She's talented too [she'll never admit it either]

She doesn't post pictures of herself or her family either and I don't blame her.  It's way too easy for someone to start shit if you do.

Better go before she kills me for writing in this!

<3 Brooke."

"event","Last night was amazing...

We went out [my girlfriend and I] with my friend Sage.

It was such a laugh.  

We managed to get to Starbucks before it closed and sat drinking coffee for half an hour before we got some to go.  Then we decided to go to Sage's house which was a stupid idea seeing as his place is a complete and utter tip!  It looks like a bomb fell in it.  So, we sat and decided to watch movies.  The Nightmare Before Christmas and Day After Tomorrow.  

So then Sage ends up getting drunk and heading to bed, leaving Brooke and I to make our own way home, which wasn't too bad really as it was a nice night.  

But Brooke and I got back to my house which was empty as a) mom and dad are visiting my grandparents, b) my younger sister is out with her cheerleading friends and c) older brother isn't back from Canada yet.  

And it was nice to be able to sleep together [yes, I do mean all the way] without having to play music or try and keep quiet.  

I'm tired now.  

Oh well."

since last thursday school's out but NOT for ever *aaaaaaaaaaah*. I defenitely dont like the fact of going to school  for another stupid year! Why the hell does Germany have that 13 year school thing, huh?
The worst part of that is, that most of my friends will be gone after the summer...
thats why me and 5 of my friends are going on a 5 or 6 days trip to holland! *harhar* 
august the 3rd it THE day ...:) ... well and right after that im going to hungary with David, my bf.
There will be a huuuuge festival (called sziget) from the 10th. up to the 17th.
well... as cool that all will be... afterwards there wont be ANY money left on my account. :/
but oh well....

so much for now."

"event","its such a shame...whenever i realize how often anyone else writes in here ...and then... well.. then i think of me as the laziest bum ever...:/
and evertime i really really try to write more often... but it just seems like i CANNOT!!!... dont ask why...
well... lots of things happened ... 
i had like billions of stupid fights with my mom... what is just horrible... because i hate arguing with her... but that seems to be a part of our both life...we just cant change... it really goes on my nerves... but in a very bad, hurting, distroying way... but enough of that.

last friday i went ...once again *lol* ... to a show of my ""favourite"" LOCAL band... for anyone who doesnt know of whom im talkin about... SIXIE & FUCHS... all right... well... it was quite awesome... not the best show ever... it was way too short... but still pretty good. afterwards a friend and i had quite a good talk with some of the guys of the band...

....

the last days... i was thinking a lot of the good days i had last year living in West Virginia.... i really miss my friends over there :( ...and that stupid time-difference really  does NOT help... man... 6 hours is a lot... thats at least what i think.  :/
all right... i gtg now... 

and you know... i TRY MY BEST!!!"

"event","hello again.
im still alive...even though i cant really blieve it... all that snow thats coming down....well...not that i dont like snow... BUT i dont have the chance to go snowboarding... so.... why should there be snow... im just freezing to death, my nose is soon going to RUN AWAY(haha), and im late for school every single morning... just because i cant ride on my bike as fast as i would have to...so.... the snow is really annoying... i have to shove several times a day... and i cannot say that that is my favorite kind of wasting my time...hmmm...
well...
one of my friends (jakob) told me about his theory that it is going to be the slow but serious beginning of a nex ice age!!! what a horrible thought... i cant wait for summer... of at least spring.... actually... summer can be pretty bad as well... with all that sweating as soon as you move just an inch to much... well.... every seasons has its pros and cons, right?!

well.. if you wonder by now why im just writing about stupid weather conditions... haha.... thats just because i dont know what else to write about... nothing really changed... im hanging out with my friends, going to local band concerts , getting bruises caused by dancing(hihi) all over, and school keeps me buzy like always....


so much for now...

until we ""see"" each other again...bye ;)

"event","hello everybody!

here i am... standin in the new year of 2005. .... well.. and nothing really changed. so... what to write about? 
the last two days i just felt like im sitting next to myself....i other words... i was totally beat. a reason might be... that i just didnt get enough rest throughout the last weekS and my body decidet to slow down in the new year.... oh well... but now im back and alive after 2 days of just being lazy at home, watching stupid movies, playing the guitar(yeah, im really really bad at it*giggle*) and eatin.

friends of mine and myself(of course) had a little party at a friends house. to keep it short:
lots of fun, music, food, and alcohol. at around 11.30pm  we walked down into the city, where there was some kind of a huge new years party with horrible music on the center plaza. well... it was still fun though.

...

i decided not to have any new year's resolutions just because you always say something like ""i dont wanna eat as much candy anymore"" or ""studying more for school"" or what ever... but are you actually doing it? NO. so... why should i make up some weird resolution im not going to do anyways?! waste of time.

happy new year to everyone."

another great weekend is over and before im off to bed i thought ... y dont u write in ur journal again, huh?!! so here i am.

i dont even know what to write about the last week(s). they were basically...normal weeks. besides the one change in my life. im no single female anymore. unbelievable... but i found my man :)... but im not going to talk about that more in here... only this... his name is David.
the weekends are always kinda the same... meeting my friends, going to parties, dancing/rocking like hell, ...just ""sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll""... (ok... the part about the sex is not really true *lol*).
saturday night was great. a good friend of mine and i, we went to a band-pub-night... what means...about 22 bands were playing at 22 different locations/bars and you got to go  and see all of them after paying 10 bucks. it was lost of fun. at 12.00am we saw ""sixie und fuchs"" (the funk-rock band i told u about). and were dancing like we had to dance for our lifes :) i was so beat today...but not only cuz of the dancing i guess.
did u ever realize how much fun u can have driving up and down in a parking-deck?! *laugh*

so much for now...  i fear ill get seriously akward if i continue writing now.

"event","summer is officially over! Not only that the nights are getting longer and longer again and it's already way too cold as soon as the sun is gone (not that it is really warm over the day...)...another fact just shouts the truth in my face...SUMMER IS OVER! 
School started last monday...i survived the first week. I have like the weirdest schedule and some very very horrible teachers.(or how would you call a math teacher who DOES NOT KNOW how to teach u anything or what book u actually need?!!)
and then is there the fact that i am not with all my friends anymore. For spending one year in wild, wonderful West Virgina i had to go back the 12th grade instead of being with all my friends(that are in 13th grade now...). And i dont know if it is just the fact that i never had too much contact with most of the students im in the same grade with right now... or if they are really just sooo different and absolutely weird... but the are so.... different. well... ill have to live with that.

i started taking guitar classes (again). and i just realized how much i actually missed it. (but hey JOHN!!!... its not quite as much fun as with having you as a ""teacher"" ^.^)

i could tell you more about school now, all the subjects i had to take... but i think... that would be just tyring you.

hmmm... the last two nights were lots of fun.... friday we drove to the next bigger town... were we went to a ""private college student party bar"" (stupid description)... it was great, already just for the fact that i met a lot of people again that graduated the last years... well... alright... also for the drinks *laugh*...i tell you ""green fairy"" is really really evil :)
and early this moring i came home from an awesome reaggeparty.
ok... enough for now. i dont want you to think im one of these girls that just keep on talking.

"event","isn't it kinda sad to realize that summer is over or getting close to that point? If u ask me..... i think it is... but it is not at the same time...weird, huh?!

next monday i'll have to actually get up EARLY, get on my good ol' bike and drive through the cold moring air...to school. once again ""hello 12th grade"". but this time in germany... not in the usa :( ...the same old same old daily scedule of life will grap and catch me. I will have to start studying again (after a whole year of doing almost nothing... pretty hard *lol*) and trying to listen to the teachers' talking while trying not to fall asleep.

and ... oh well.. i try not to get swallowed by the dangerous big feeling of beeing dissapointed and hurt ... 

so... at this place SOME facts that made my summer unique *laugh*...

graduating in WV ;)
the creamery and the best chunky chocolate ice cream
crusing around with holly *yay*...and stopping by at sheetz 
laying on the deck
bonnaroo
having to leave my new, second home :(
hanging out with all my old friends
rockin'
thousands of ""homeparties""
behaving like little kids on a playground at 2.am :)
...

i really dont want do get on anyone's nerves... thats why im stopping here.

ok... i have to admit.. i just try to waste some time... because im sooo hungry but i have to wait at least 2 more hours till i get something to eat...why? you mean i could just walk up to the fridge?! ha! sad but true... we dont have one of these magical ones that are ALWAY FULL.. no. the other point is... im going out for dinner with a good friends. she's leaving soon. so thats a good reason for having a huge feast : ^.^

"event","Girl and guy were speeding over 100 mph on the road on a motorcycle...

Girl: Slow down. Im scared.
Guy: No this is fun.
Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!
Guy: Then tell me you love me.
Girl: Fine, I love you. Slow down!
Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.
*Girl hugs him*
Guy: Can you take my helmet off & put it on yourself? Its bugging me.

(In the paper the next day):

A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of break failure. 2 people were on it, but only 1 survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his breaks broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him & felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die.

i spent the last week (better 9 days!) with my grandfather. what about that?! hes the most difficult, and nerve wrecking person i ever met. jesus christ... why does a person have to crytisize EVERYTHING he sees, make (mostly negative, discriminating) coments about EVERYTHING, not accept any other view of point than the own one, ... *aaaaaaah*... its just like... ok...nevermind. i could go on and on like that for pages now. but i might die of a heart attac as a cause.

the weather here is defenitely...SHIT. what doesnt really help to cheer my mood up. i dont really know why im such a bad bad mood... i havent had that for quite a while. there are probably several reasons.

first of that whole last week(of course...*lol*)... than the fact of realizing that nothing worked out the way i expected, being disabpointed in differnt ways by several things, and people(what is probably not only the persons's fault.. more the wrong expectations... i guess). everything seems pretty grey right now. maybe i should try to sleep and forget everything.. but damn it... im not tired...

ok.. i better stop now... u dont need my trashy thoughts.. right?

it has been great...lol
all the time there's something going on around here...two weekend ago there was a festival i the next town... 48hours program non stop... and the best it was for free... so i would say... the perfect thing for someone who hast almost NO money but a big need to dance :) ... of course there were no famous or popular bands playing... at least none u would know... BUT.... they were great... they played all kinds of music... from alternative rock over reggae to ska and punk... everything was there :)
well... i still left a lot of money there...:)... beer isnt cheap (too bad *argh)
oh well... then last wednesday all my friends had there last day of school... finally... so we just HAD to celebrate that night :) ...
this weekend there was another festival right here in my little town. was there only one night though that was awesome... saturday one of my friend (uli) had her ""good bye party""....cuz shes leaving for an exchange year(what kina sux... i come back, she leaves...)... but the bad thing is.. she doesnt even know yet, where and when shes going... so shes pretty nervous... 
if someone in the usa wants to take an exchange student... PLEASE go to asse and say u want her...lol

what else...hmmm i dont even remember... its like... my short term memory is dying or something ... :) ... if i say i had just a great time with my old friends, too much to drink, not enough to smoke (HOLLY, only twice since im BACK!!! i miss u....), not enough to sleep either, thousands of concerts i went etc. ... im defenitely not wrong :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

now.... i just read my dear friend holly+s journal... so thats mostly for her :)
its all right that u missed the call... there are gonna be a lot more night i'll be coming home buzzed :) ...*laugh*.
and maybe it sounds stupid for u guys if u read hear anger about the guitar purse... but if u ever had a special relationship with something its really special...... and that bag was so ...HOLLY... yeah... the best way to describe it.

to that betrayal thing i remember some quote...

""an insincere and evil friend is more to fear than a wild beast;
    a wild beast can wound your body, but an evil friend will wound your sould."" [buddah]

i dont wanna say with that now that she is evil or so... it just came right into my mind ....*think*...............

r u sure though that u wanna send THE bag to me? its so yours... hang it on your wall... or something ... i dont wanna rip u guy apart!...(so i would treat and wear it with honor!)



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


oh my god... something else happend... i bought new shoes... i got them at ebay... NO they werent used...again they r chucks.. i just dont get away from them..... and they are... TOTALLY GREEN!!!! like everything!... no white rubber and shit :). i was so excited whenever i got them!

im back in germany now since LAST saturday... and everything gets back to 'normal'... in a way at least.
tomorrow our new sofa gets in... some friends daughter picked up our old one today.... :( i thought i would sit on it FOR EVER... but now its gone... and there is NO sofa right now... so HOW can i watch a movie tonight without being totally uncomfortabel....*laugh*... i have to say... i havent seen a movie for.... more than 1 1/2 months... and i dont miss it at all...*lol*... tv sux... but thats just my oppinion... kids should read more bookS!!! they r great... dont destroy their fantasy...

oh... yesterday my friends and i... we drove to the next town... on of our friends(patrick) and ""his"" band played at an open air event... but the to other bads that were playing werent good at all... the first one actually pretty bad... but oh well.. we didnt have to pay anything... so thats all right... but whenever one of the guys from the organisation kinda jelled at us... just because of bringing in our beer... that pissed me off... in a way...

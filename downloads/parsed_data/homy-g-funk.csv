"event","Ok, I think I've figured out what classes I like the most. I like the first three hours of the day, then I dont like the last three hours of the day as much. So my first class would be art, and I can just draw in there and not be disturbed cuz I dont like anyone in that class. Second hour is exploring lit., which is cool cuz there's a lot of people in that class that are my friends, and I just like english. Third hour is my research class (I told you I like english), it kinda sux though cuz I'm like the only jr. in that class though, but there's a hot student teacher. Fourth hour is gov., its' alright but I really dont care for it to much. I dont like ecology really, but its allright to. But I can say I hate math, and will always hate math. Thats all I have to say."

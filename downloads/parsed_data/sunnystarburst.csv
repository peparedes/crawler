<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=1>Well... tonight is gonna be awesome. We are sleeping outside in the tent, and hopefully it won't rain!!! *crosses fingers* </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=1>I'm really tired. Last night I finished the book I was reading. Luna, by Julie Anne Peters. It was from a girl named Regan's point of veiw. Its basically about she and her brother,&nbsp;Liam&nbsp; (or sister, Luna), deal with Laim being transexual. For all those who don't know what that means, it means you were born a one gender, but in your mind you are the other. I think thats why most people get Sex Changes... Hmm... But it was really good. Very interesting. <BR></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=1>Well, dinners ready, so I'll write some other time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=1>Well, i went to the Autoport with Jo (Family friend; Haven't seen for a year) and my mum and sis. Had fun!! Then, my sis and I went to Coldstone Creamery and got Cheesecake ice cream, which was amazingly good. Then we came home and watched Fawlty Towers. After that I went upstairs and called Hannah. I read for about an hour after that and then Katie called and I talked to her til dinner. Then my dad and I set up the tent to see if we could actually do it, and we did. And now I'm sitting here, IMing people, and hoping to go to sleep soon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=1>Well.. Today I woke up at like.... 11:40, then went on a bikeride then took a shower. Then I ate some toast and went on the computer. Then after about an hour, I ate a pizza-like thing. After that I went on the computer some more. After that i tried playing Kingdom Hearts, but there was too much on the Memory Card. So I downloaded Toon Town on my sissy's compy. I played that until dinner, then after dinner too. I went upstairs onto my computer later, did some stuff, got a push-up thingy, and then practiced piano. After that I played on the computer, which I am still doing. Now, I'm going to go get ready for bed. Goodnight. </FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=1>-yawn- I just got back from Debbie's house like an hour ago. Hannah, Deb, me, her papa, Kaye, Andy, and Liz D. all went to see Fiddler on the Roof last night at the Boal Barn. It was AMAZING! And I saw Kevin and Eliza there. Kevins still really nice, but definately a lot cuter than he used to be. :P Lol. I also met Eli. Hes really nice too. There were some reallllly hot guys in Fiddler. And Mr. Brinser was in it! Hes the eighth grade music teacher at Mount Nittany. It was funny... he said ""Mama"" like ""Marmar."" Soooo funny. It was bad, Hannah and I burst out laughing, and it was during a serious part.. oopsies...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=1>Hannah and I are going to the Boy Scout Picnic and the Knights at 6 tonight. Should be good fun. </FONT></P>

"event","soooo, i had a rough night last night, and rough day today. i dont think i want to see mike anymore. various justified reasons. last night i called alvaro, i miss him so much. i only said hello and he hung up. it was the worst feeling ive had in a<em> long</em> time. i sent him a message saying that he should at least talk to me long enough to tell me whats wrong. im going to call him back tonight or tomorrow. me and alex have been talking, he told me that i just need to decide on one guy, and start being better when it comes to guys. i finally took his advice, and the one i know for sure that i want doesnt want me. i fucked up, and theres no one and nothing &nbsp;to blame but myself. i hate it, nobody likes living up to taking responsibility for their actions, and now i have to. it just hurts to know i was so careless, when i used to be an incredibly caring person. ive fallen into a sort of indifference to almost everything, and last night was kinda my wake up call. im not going to forgive myself if he cant forgive me.&nbsp;<br />i dont know what to do right now.&nbsp; school is driving me crazy. one of my friends is having trouble with my other friend, and i do see where she's coming from, but the thing is, is that the other friend doesnt know she's having trouble with her. (could i make that any more confusing?) its soooo frustrating. and im super annoyed that some students returned, but that happens every quarter. im extremely happy with my art independant, so at least thats good. carolina got a puppy, her name is mancha and shes an australian sheperd husky mix. shes <strong>adorable.&nbsp;<br /></strong>as ridiculous as this sounds i really cant stand myself, at least not right now. im just completely disgusted by my lack of initiative and my lack of acting on what i want, and my avoiding things instead of just being blunt. on the brighter side, alex is getting me into the fear before the march of flames show for free. thank you!"

"event","sooooooooooo school starts in a week. which is shitty, i didnt even realize it until yesterday night. yesterday night ets car got towed. we were on wilson street for this show because shannon and henry just HAD to see us there, blah blah blah. so we found out shortly after we arrived that it got movesd to the warehouse. great. so we said fuck it and fuck them, and walked around and got ice cream. and when we arrived bach at the car, lo and behold!: the car was gone, towed away. now we've called every towing place there is and the police department, and no one knows where it is. good going, guys. aaaaaaaaaaanyway, henry is being stupid, so im trying to push that out of my mind. davie called me out of nowhere the other day. i feel bad for him and i still like him and want to be nice to him, but i just cant. he told me he was sory for what he did, and i do believe him, and he told me he wants to be friends and hang out and that hell be there for me from now on if i want him to be. alls i said was that sorry isnt good enough, and that being there for me now isnt good enough either, because i needed him then and he wasnt. so thats where that stands. i still cant sleep, my doctor is doing that gay thing where they ""test"" you out on different meds to see which one is ""the best one"" for me. bullshit. everything theyve tried has not helped, i think its time to bust out the tranquilizers. in other news, there isnt really other news. things are going better than they have most of this summer, i have an at least decent job, more friends than i started out with, a good guy who sadly likes me a whole lot more than i like him, and a fairly decent attitude about passing my classes. yep."

"event","so heres whats been goin down...
i been hanging out with hannah and et alot lately. seeing et is always awesome, she always knows either the right thing to say or completely the wrong thing to say that will make me laugh. its also cool hanging out with hannah because she doesnt make a big deal out of things but she still takes them to heart, and she always always picks up the phone when i call, and even lets me chill with her and alex sometimes. i went to the upon desolate hands show on....tuesday? i think. theyre good, faux lament and mosaic suck alot, and upon desolate hands played last so it ended up being a long night. i saw two of davies friends, hillary and steven. hillary said that he hasnt said anything about hating me or disliking me ever, and that hes in georgia again b/c his gma died. steven may or may not have agreed with me that he doesnt want to talk to me anymore, im still not sure what he meant. i feels bad because i havent seen betsy at all, but its okay because i think its okay with her, i will surely see her soon. theres a fear before the march of flames show on august 20th and i will cut down anything that stands in my path to go. alex (little alex) hates me alot, which makes me so much sadder than i let on. last night was strange. i got in a fight with him, which was actually him telling me everything i already know about myself right now, getting angry annd telling me not to call him until i give a shit about him or me, or anything else for that matter, then hanging up on me. needless to say, i havent called him back. so then i got lifted and sat outside in the storm for awhile. it was scary as heeeelll, but also one of the coolest things ive done in a long time. ive been thinking alot about henry lately. not because davies gone and alvaros a dick (oh yeah, did i mention? alvaros a dick!) but because hes the exact kind of person i want in my life. i dont mean romantically even, i just want him back here and to hang out with him. hes the kind of person that you can sit outside freezing cold or in the rain and just look at everything around you and be content with. hes the kind of person that doesnt want to fill silence with words. i always felt calm and careless with him, it was incredible. we had good healthy times together, as well as indecent times, inebriated times, and altogether funny times. 
as for me im still in the same place as before. i went really crazy the other night, alex told me i should check myself in, haha jerk. still havent stopped ""the bad things"" but ive started some good things too. im getting over davie, which i dont want to do because i know theres a good chance of making things better, but im doing anyway. ive been paintnig. i spray painted a picute on the wall in my moms garage, then decided to paint over it because i didnt like it. i started a different painting out of oil, and ive been trying to keep myself busy. 
news flash: carolina will be in the united states on sunday july 23rd. how fucking weird is that? im not ready for my dad to actually have a wife. a wife who happens to be my friend. uuggh wweeeeeeeeiirrrd. well anyway ill spare you the complaints and say goodbye"

"event","im fucking shit up like i was back in the old days. me and ET had a good talk the other night. we're both in about the same spot mentally... i dont know who i am anymore, the person who knows me best in this entire world doesnt know who i am anymore (little alex), and thats a goddamn scary thing. the difference between me and ET is that she doesnt go out very much, she just kinda goes to work and talks to a select few people and chills at home. i, on the other hand, fuck shit up. immensley. im scared of alot of bad things happening, and i know for a fact im not scared without reason. but then, im so apathetic. its so much easier to continue the way i have been and continue being angry at myself than to take initiative and just fucking stop. but then i don know of single soul who has just ""stopped"" the shit ive been around. i need help before everything goes to hell, but theres nowhere to go for help that i wont get my ass in huuuuuuge trouble. you see, things havent gone to hell yet, theyre just in purgatory, waiting. if i dont get help, things will go to hell for a fucking long time, the thing is is that i wont care, and i know i wont care. if i do get help, things will go to hell for not a fucking long time, even though it will seem like forever, but eventually they will get better, and i know they will get better. i just dont care to make things better. i mean, i care, believe me i care, but i dont care for me. i care for every other person and thing in my life, but not for me. i caaaaaaaannnnntttt stand hearing almost any one elses complaints, they just havent seen what ive seen, by that i mean 2 days ago, lately, my whole life. i know that sounds selfish to most anyone, but then again most anyone doesnt know shit about me these days. i think im going to go to genes house when he gets back. i need someone who actually has knowledge in their head to talk to me. friends are great, but the friends i have left can only keep me busy, they cannot help me, and they cannot give me any help in fixing myself. i need someone who actually believes in me, because i sure as fuck dont."

"event","soooo im at hannahs house right now, as i have been for most of the day. I saw alex this morning, i had a itty bitty interview shit thing at pedros :( and i think we're going to a show with big alex in a bit. last night was the most fucked up night ive had in a fucking long time, and i mean ""fucked up"" in every sense of the phrase. basically im making people hang out with me constantly. i havent spoken to davie in a week, he's angry at me and more than likely doesnt want to talk to me ever again, which is horrible because hes the only person who i can talk to about last night who will understand and know what to say to make it feel better. too bad i drink too much and like to fuck shit up immensely. this is going to be another complaint post, just to warn. im really scared about school. i have betsy and hannah and camryn, i used to have davie and maybe charlie will end up joining in the little group, but thats not actually the problem. school is going to be the end of ""carrie as we know her,"" i can already tell. i might not graduate on time if i dont fuck up this year, but i dont see how i can do well in school, even GO to school, and still stay in some type of frame of mind, good or bad. i think im going a little crazy. the thoughts i have arent thoughts normal people have, or even thoughts that fucked up people normally have. i dont know who i am as a person, but i know what i want, so how the fuck do i fill in the gap? 
Carolina is coming in 2 weeks. its weird. i like her alot, we're friends, but now thats shes going to live here, IN WISCONISN, she's not carolina anymore, shes my dads wife. i dont like that. I was talking to him the other day, and i was saying how she should come to shows and hang out with me and my friends sometimes, and my dad just looked at me like i was crazy. hes being controlling already. 
i miss alvaro. i want to go with my dad on saturday and stay there for 10 days, but i cant. i feel so much better there than here. i know its stupid to want to run away to honduras every time i feel like this, and i know i need to learn to fix things here, but that doesnt change things here."

"event","so I got back from honduras early friday mornining. i slept for the afternoon, went to dinner with my mom and mark at maharaja, then hannah and betsy came and picked me up at 9. we got ice cream, then drove around, then went to taco bell, then drove around, dropped betsy off and then drove around. It was really nice actually, I've been feeling bad about being home, and it was good to see the girls and not really do anything. we ended up staying out until like 1 which was about perfect and just talking and catching up. I started working yesterday, i've made about 65 $ already. I dont think im doing anything for awhile, hopefully im going on a roadtrip to iowa to see seth and the band, then to the show/party on the 4th, but that's all a week from now. 
honduras was good, I didn't do a whole lot, but that was a good thing. I wasn't doing so well before I left, it was good to get away from here  for awhile. Alvaro and I are good, i tried to call him today and he wasn't home even though he said he would be which is a stupid guy move, but hey what are you gonna do? First issue back home: boys. While I was gone hannah saw david and steven, and steven wanted to know where I was. hannah told him and he said that that's too bad, because david really liked me. blah blah blah he cares about me and wants to actually be with me. oops. you see, I never told him about alvaro. i told alvaro about him, but not the other way. it just never crossed my mind that he felt that way about me, and it never came up, so... so im going to wait to see if he calls me when he gets back, and IF things go further with him, MAYBE i'll tell him, if we end up just like we were before I left, im not. Im excited that he actually likes me, but that means i already hurt him and he doesn't even know it. beh. anyway, im going to go cheer myself up now and eat some food, and back to working tomorrow."

"event","daaaaaaayum! what a trip! Ive been having crazy days lately. so i went to school on monday, which is always shitty. I get to deal with bitchy people and shitty classes and bright lights for 7 hours. sooo anyway! i got home from school and called davie to see if he wanted to hang out, than i asked if hannah wanted to come with. I went to work, got home early, hannah came over. i worked on some stencils and we made plans to meet davie downtown and put them up. so we met up at about 930 and did it. it was a good time, hannah is really funny to watch. so we chilled and painted, then took the bus home. we saw that shady guy. luckily he didn't talk to us. when we got home we started drinking. and drinking. and drinking. me and hannah weren't puking drunk, just fall over drunk, and davie was pretty good too. so we had a good time hanging out on my floor. once again, one thing led to another and me and davie ended up making out real good and then another thing led to another and we ended up fucking, it was... !!! so he was really nice afterward and he put his arms around me and we fell asleep like that. we got up sometime around 10, found a bunch of shit that had gotten knocked over and realized that somehow my toe got broken. hannah went to school, we stayed behind. he was being so nice! he kept kissing me really  nicely (can't think of a better word) and stuff and yeah. he's really a good guy, and even if he is a little stupid he's really fun to hang out with. 
henry spent the night last night. nothing much happened between us. that was the last time im going to see him for i don't even know how long. it was sad. 
so, I'm going to the warehouse with ET on friday, then to seth's show with hannah and betsy on saturday, then to the bsc house afterward, and i think davie's coming with us. :) then im hopefully going to his ""cottage"" on sunday. should be a good weekend.
so, basically, im leaving in like....12 days? I keep getting this really strong urge to take my car and just leave. I don't know where to or for how long, but to just leave. it's the weirdest feeling. i think i'll find someone to go with me, and we'll do it."

The party we were going to go to sucked, so we just chilled down there. Hannah knows this guy steven, and the brandon fellow was okay. so we went to their car and drank. then we met this shady ass mother fucker, ran into camryn zon and that gang, then we got rid of the shady ass motherfucker, and we split with david and steven and brandon. we drank some more, tried to find a pool in peoples back yards, went to ians, got a bottle of wine. shit was cool. brandon got sick, so we made him go home. we wnt back to my place after chillin at henry vilas and me and david finished off the wine. It was cool, we were are just chillin, hannah left at about 430, we stayed up awhile longer rocking the fuck out then steven passed out on my floor. Me and david stayed up talking for ever. It was chill, he's a fucking cool cat. I think we went to sleep at 730, then we got up at 1230, they left at one, i went to work at 4. yesterday hannah cam e to pick me up after work and we picked david up, then steven and this stupid fuck. our plans didn't work out, so we chilled downtown. we ran into henry, then hannah went home, david and his friends split, so me and henry hung out. we walked back to my house from fucking langdon. I stepped in goose shit w/ my bare feet. yuck. so im not going to go into detail but me and henry had a really good talk, and one thing led to another, and... yay i had a really good two nights, i'll leave it at that. I was suppoesed to hang out with ryan today, but i didn't feel like it, so i didn't.

and this is to you bree: you are seriously the bitchiest person i know. you used to be so fucking cool, and now look at you. your parents are THE SHIT and you treat them like dogs. I would kill to have your parents. you're friends are the best in the world because they stick with a person like you. By the way, you treat betsy like shit, she is the best friend you will ever have and i hope you know you are ruining your relationship with her. You think everyone likes you, but in reality i know that alot of people just can't stand you. You treated hannah like shit, I tried to apologize for HER ACTIONS NOT MINE and you were cold. You want to know why you're feeling ""distressed""? it's because being such an enormous bitch to people who care about you and being so goddamn selfish must take alot of fucking energy. I'd be distressed if I was like you too. you need to take a fucking good look at yourself and decide who the shitty person really is.





on a lighter note, I finally got ahold of alvaro. the first thing he said to me was ""carrie?"" then ""I'm SO sorry."" so now i feel quite a bit better. good day all in all."

"event","so things haven't been going awfully, but they haven't neccesarily been going good either. I drank on saturday and sunday, after saying that I don't want to drink anymore and really meaning it. It went well though, I didn't drink too much or get sick. Weeeelll, now my stomach is pulsating and on every out-pulse it hurts, but I don't know that it has anything to do with drinking since I finished my pills awhile ago. anyway.
I think me and alvaro are breaking up. I've been trying to call him for a week now. He never picks up, he never calls me, emails me or even messages me. He's been in tegus since last thursday, so I don't talk to him very much when he's there, but christ is this ridiculous. If he doesn't want me to talk to him anymore he should at least have the decency to let me know so that I don't waste any more money or time on him. motherfuck! I'm still happy to be going to honduras even if i'm not overreacting about alvaro. There's nena and negrito and steven and ingrid and everyone else that i want to see, and there's other boys too. I guess Willie regrets being so stupid to me, but oh well that's his own damn fault. 
some other fucked up shit happened on thursday, those of you who actually care know, so that's all i'm gunna say about it. 
I don't know why but every day when I get to school i feel like shit. I'm not going to go into the details, but I'm always in a good mood when I wake up and get ready. then, as soon as i get to the sidewalk in fron of school it comes. The only things i really look forward to at school are seeing betsy and hannah and sometime camryn because he's so goddamn nice, and smoking, and creativity day in 6th hour. I also look forward to seeing another person who i choose to be unknown. today we were talking in class and we were laughing, and he asked me what i m doing on friday. i laughed at him (it related to what we were joking about) but then he kep looking at me waiting for an answer. awww shit did i feel stupid. anyway, i like being around him, he's always really nice. 
so other than that shit is uneventful. i got a new bra and a sparkly shirt today. whoo. shopping typically makes one feel better, no?"

"event","aw shit dog! things have been going interestingly lately. I smoked on 420 for the first time in my life on thursday. I had to explain to alvaro what getting stoned meant, it was rather amusing. Yesterday was really good too. went to school, chilled with the kids. 
Then I went to work at 4:30 to learn how to be a dishwasher. I'll keep the sentimental shit minimal... It's actually not that hard, the hot water and bleach hurt a bit, but it's nothing that can't be handled. I like it a lot better because you're away from everything: the customers, the kitchen, john. and you can eat the leftovers in the pan. but things got busy and john was freaking himslef out again, so he made me and henry quit dishwashing and had me cashier with amanda. goddamnit. I ended up dumping 2 containers of shit all over myself: first it was a pan with soggy rice in it, and couldn't see that there was something in it b/c it was above my head, so when I grabbed it to wash it a got soggy rice all over myself.  then, even nastier, I was cleaning out a cooler, and I reached to take a bucket out. The bucket had a lid on it, so i started taking it down and tilted it to handle it easier.. and OOOOHHH shit! Nasty ass RAW OYSTERS IN THEIR OWN NASTY ASS JUICY SHIT all the fuck down my cheek, neck, chest arms and pants. I had to pick the oyster off of me! ACKI! everyone was like ""OOOH SHIT!!!"" its was disgusting, and I smelled really bad and itched even after i rinsed off and changed clothes. sooo at closing henry made a shit tonne of fried okra, so i dumped hot sauce on it and we all chilled and ate while we closed. henry asked if i wanted to hang out, go to a park. yes! so everynoe from work minus john hung out outside with some of ricks friends, then when john came out everyone left. me and henry just sat around and talked, then we played on some swings, then we went to bed. so he left this morning and I worked in my little garden and went to the dog park and did laundry, and sat around thinking of what else i could do. I'm most likely going to a show tonight and hopefully that goes well."

It was nice talking to all those kids, and Xia formerly from the co op was there and damn is he/she crazy, not in a good way.
I went up north on sunday and cleaned a house for money, ad i've been working alittle more lately. yesterday i did something i've never done intentionally at shabazz: I came to school high after smoking. It was all right though, all we did was take a walk for the class I came back for. sooooooo I'm getting trained to be a dishwasher at work by henry on friday, so hopefully more money will be coming my way. 
I'm HOPEFULLY going back to honduras on june 7th or 8th until the 22nd. I'm really excited, but i have to pass all my classes and pay for alot of it:/ i really hope i can do all that, it's harder than it seems."

"event","so, today was shitty but in a sort of humorous way. Me and betsy are both in pain, and so naturally we complained about it all day and very needfully hobbled around. I think my kidney is feeling better, and I hope betsys face is feeling better. I feel like such a slacker because it's almost been 3 weeks into the quarter (or 2???) but i seriously haven't done shit. 
I got ahold of alvaro last night, finally. I guess he ruined his cell phone because he was drunk and went swimming with it in his pocket, and he was in tegus with his uncle all week, but I kinda guessed that's where he was. So things went well, I got really happy to talk to him finally, but he was kinda bothering me. it costs me alot of money to call, you see, and he kept telling me to hold on so could say something to his dad or help his mom with something or other, all that jazz. anyway, we didn't end on as good of a note as we started, because of a couple other things. I really wonder when im going to be going back. i hope soon. I talked to his mom today, she wants me to come live with her. I wish i could...
So, i think the barbeque went well, for the most part. I personally got too drunk too fast and laid down pretty early. But! theres an excuse: I had a stomach infection in honduras and I thought it went away, but my stomach was bothering me on tuesday and wednesday. so i went to the doctor thursday morning and they said it didn't go away. so at least i have an excuse for being as sick as i was. I've sworn off drinking, or at least getting drunk, for awhile. at least until i'm off my horse pills.
I'm not really feeling seth these days, and i think he knows it. like, i don't wait up for him in the halls, i don't really talk to him in class, and he doesn't make an effort either. It's actually not bothering me as much as i thought it would, but i have my reasons... well thats about it."

"event","So, things have been going pretty well lately. I'm feeling better about most of my friends, but I know for a fact that I'm not really anyone's ""best friend"" around here either. I've been trying to keep myself busy and distracted though. I got my job back at NOTO on friday, and I did absolutley nothing the rest of the night, which is fine with me. saturday we had a cook out at my house, a bunch of people came including bree and betsy and markitos and his beatiful older friend Oscar. they all ended up leaving early, and the rest of us ended up getting trashed. so wake up time came on sunday, and I got ready for the day. I met up with joe that afternoon, we ran errands and chilled at my house, then henry came and we took miss oya to the dog park. It was quite enjoyable. Later bree and betsy and diana came to pick me up to go to the show, joe left and henry raced us there on his bike. silly henry. so the show was pretty cool, a bunch of people from school were there as well. me and betsy ended up drunk...lovely low tolerance... I remember talking to Zon about henry's ass and saying how exceptional it is and us discussing it a bit, and then realizing that henry was standing right there. ah oh well. I finally told him that i like him, after all this time, and I yelled ""te quiero mucho"" out of the car window...
we went to the rally yesterday, it was really good, and I actually care about this issue. 
Alvaro still won't pick up his phone, I haven't talked to him since wednesday and that was only for about 15 minutes. I'm worried that he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. if that is the case i can deal with it, but he should at least have the decency to pick up and tell me so so that I don't waste any more money or time on him. then again i'm prolly just overreacting and he probably just doesnt have any money on his phone, or he could be gone with his family because it's semana santa. We got word from immigration today but not the visa. but this is still really good because once the letter thingy from immigration gets to the homeland security office the interview for the visa at the honduran embassy is supposed to be set up right away, and she will be able to come here. so hopefully i'm going back to pick her up and see my friends and my boyfriend in may instead of june. whoo! anyway, i'm sick as heeeellll (thank you betsy and henry!) and I don't have much else. sorry to anyone who reads this because i just comlpained alot."

"event","Well...I've been back home for 10 days now, and I still feel weird as hell. Everybody says that they're happythat I;m back, but it seems like a couple aren't. People from school are great for the most part... I mean, I know people change, and I know I've changed over the years, but I just feel unwanted. For example, my best friends at school were Betsy and Seth. And me betsy and seth were always together. But now it'sbetsy and seth, and i'm kind of on the outside looking in. I know it must be weird for me to just show up after 2 months, but still..... I don't know. I want to be closer with my friends, but I don't feel like they want me closer. 
and that doesn't help my missing honduras problem either. I was thinking about what i had waiting for me back at home: my friends, my puppy. and now I feel like I just have my puppy and some not-so-close-friends and nothing else, and no one wants to hear about it. I miss nena and steven, ET and Alvaro and Ingrid so much. The thing is no matter what I feel like they wanted me around, and i know for a fact i'm always welcome back. I don't know how to explain but I feel like the people here can't accept me for who I am(typical teen statement, huh?), and the people there did, very easily...and I miss it alot. I just am not happy how things are here, but I can't make my friends change, and I can't just leave and go back.
other than trouble adjusting to being here, things are.... things are. I need a job, and I need a CHEAP ASS place to live starting whenever I get a good enough job. right now i'm in oshkosh visiting my sister until wednesday, then school starts on thursday.... maybe next weekend will be a little more lively than this one."

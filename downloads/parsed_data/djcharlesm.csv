"event","Your own planet, serious Saturn, will spend the first half of the year influencing you with regard to relationships, Capricorn, and the second urging you to get up close and personal with someone you've just recently learned to trust. But during the whole of 2005, you'll be just as concerned as ever with your career. The good news is that you'll be amply rewarded for your efforts in all departments, and the kudos will start pouring in as soon as the 9th of January.

For the rest of winter, you'll focus on your personality and appearance. You may be in the mood to start a diet or quit a bad habit during January. In February, you'll want to tend to money matters -- which may be a bit tricky to navigate. Keep an open mind, and don't hesitate to explore unconventional possibilities. The full Moon of March 25th will bring attention to a family situation -- one you've been worried about for some time. Let go and let your emotions show. The solar eclipse in April will help to bring closure to the matter.

For the rest of spring, you'll be intent on getting closer to someone you've only been thinking of casually for some time now. It's time to put intimacy on the front burner. Whether it's emotional, physical or intellectual doesn't matter. Bare your soul with confidence. In particular, the full Moon of June 22nd will arrive just in time to help you be brave and bold, personally speaking. Take advantage of it.

The urge to get close won't be going anywhere soon, either. All during summer, you'll be focused on a certain person -- but fortunately, they'll be just as focused on you! This could mean -- once again -- that you're due to either end a relationship or take a casual encounter to a whole new level. Just don't let your work slide. You have your reputation to think of.

A voice from the past could arrive early in fall. Before you allow them back into your life, be sure you're ready for a committed relationship -- because that's exactly what they'll have in mind. During October, two eclipses will help you to turn toward career matters and think less about personal things. By the time the holidays roll around, you'll be quite ready to relax -- and you'll certainly have earned it. Some new family members may be along to help you enjoy your time together -- but don't forget about that mistletoe!"

"event","So I decided to not post what i wrote on the second of January, so I'll just sum it up now; MY NYE WAS OFF THE HOOK!! I had a blast and I got to see some friends that I havent seen in a long time. I went to Yborg city (Tampa) to see Dj Magic Mike, Dj Who, R-Fresh, Neutron, Hiatus, and some other kids spin.. Its funny, guys in Florida cant dance... Or atleast they couldnt that night. Damn, thinking about NYE again and my birthdaY is just making me miss florida. =( Anyways, after we left Level 3, me Roxy, Mike, and some other kids went to Hard Rock Casino for an afterparty... 

Saturday, I went to Painted Puppy & Hot Wax and ended up spending about 300 dollars on records! So needless to say, I got some nice ass rekids and a cd will be out soon... (I'm trying to fit about 21-25 songs to my new cd) We'll see how that goes..

Sunday, drove from Tampa to Jacksonville and saw some of my old friends... Me and Sarah ended up at my friend Brooke's friend Annette's house DEEEEERUNK!!!! Sunday 4am, left Florida, made Sarah drive all the way back to dc. LOL!

Life has been alot more meaningful, calmer, and happier since the first. I'm just happy that I have been doing things for me for once, instead of doing things for everyone else like i always do."

"event","I just want you to know that I will always love you. Even through all of the things we've been through, bad or good, you will always have a place in my heart, and in my memories...

You made me feel like no one has ever been able to. You are the love of my life. I said ""are the love of my life."" because that's never going to change. Then with time and our problems, she made me feel like I was nothing at all.  I went from being ""her everything"" and ""the most beautiful boy in the whole world,"" to someone that makes her mad no matter what I do or say. 

I just want you to know a few things. I know that I hurt you in the past and it took me getting locked up to see how much i was hurting you. I'm sorry for all of that. I mean that from the bottom of my heart! If i would have just had a clear mind I would have never been the way I was. I'm sorry Mel. If I could turn back time then I would. I would make everything right. We have both been hurtful to one another with no thought of how the other person is going to be feeling from actions or words that we say or do to one another. I would give anything in this world to make things different. Anything in this world! 

I don't understand why you hate me. I know that you hate me. I can see it in your eyes. The way that you look at me, you have no idea how much I wish I could just die when you look at me the way you do sometimes. It hurts so much when the person I would do anything in this world for and the person that I love more than life itself thinks of me as nothing to her, and I'm not good enough to be a part of her life. No matter what I say or do, you yell at me now. You always look down on me and the tone in your voice is condescending. You look down on me for everything that I do. You will stand up for anyone and everyone except for me. I try everyday to make you happy, to not say anything to make you mad, to not do anything to piss you off. I try everyday! It's just not good enough for you.

I don't know what to do with you or our relationship, or whatever you would call it. I'm at the point where I really can't take it anymore. I'm not the same person because of you, you have made me feel like I'm not anyone special, like I'm not good enough to be in your life. You have made me lose confidence in myself. You have broken my heart like you have no idea. I dont trust anyone anymore because, I trusted you with everything and you just did everything in this world to hurt me.  I have to build myself back up. We both let each other back in one another's lives, it's not because one of us or the other, it's both of us. I even started to accept the fact that you didnt ever want to be with me again, and that the only reason that you did talk to me was because of drugs and for sex.  The worst part about all of this is when we had finished having sex one time and I realize that I didnt feel us making love anymore. It turned into you just fucking me. Even finding out all of the things that you had done with so many other people, didnt hurt me as much as our love making, turning into nothing more than an orgasm then a ""I'll call you next time I want to fuck you."" 
You even made up lies about me that you thought I would never find out about. You lied to people that you let down or for whatever the reason, and you made up lies about me. Why would you do that? Why would you tell someone I threw you out of a window while you were pregnant? Why would you tell someone that I beat you and you called the cops on me, when that never happened... You have been lying about me for no other reason other than making me look like I'm a bad person. Do you understand that there is something wrong inside of your head? You don't make up lies about people like that. 

The reason that I'm writing all of this is to basically just tell you how I feel and to let you know how the things you do and the things you say affect me. You not making time to talk to me, when I tell you that ""there is something i need to talk to you about, that 's very serious.""  and you not caring enough to make time for us to talk, was the last time I will ever let you hurt me. For two days you put things that aren't nearly as important before me. After all that we have been through, for two days you put bullshit in front of me. You were coming to see me on wednesday then you turned around and went home because you were mad about something that had to do with drugs. DRUGS or FRIENDSHIP. Then on Thursday I tell you once again that , ""I need to talk to you about something very important."" and you decided to go to a night club to hear a dj spin. That club will be there next week. That dj will get another booking.  You have hurt me for the last time. I do everything I can for you. I would have done anything for you. You mean that much to me. In my life, you come  first. Remeber when you called me at like 3 in the morning and I had to get up for school in 2 hours. Did I blow you off when you called to talk about how hurt you were that you boyfriend Rob had been treating you the way he was? Was I there for you? What about when You wrecked your car and Rob wouldnt even come get you, I was in class, taking a test, did I tell you ""I have to go because, I'm in class taking a test? I left class, and talked to you. I was there for you! My professor never let me retake my test. 

You complain about me being all up in your business, but the only reason I do look after you is because I never want you to have to go through the things I did. I never want you to stumble. So I look after you just incase you do fall. In other words, if you do fall, I'm going to be there to catch you. You mean the world to me... You're my everything.  Well you were all of that. But I can't let someone that means so much to me and, I mean nothing to them have that kind of affect on me. I've learned that you should never making someone your priority when your only their option.

Take care of yourself, 
Charles"

"event","Wow I haven't updated in a minute. So let's see. There's a whole bunch of bullshit going on in my life right now. And honestly I don't know what to do about it. So if you have any suggestions please feel free to let me know... And now our feature presentation.....

THE FUN PART...... Friday & Saturday

Friday was alot of fun... Those details must be left out... Just about all of them, hmm I was definately deeerunk, Ended up going to Melissa's house to crash. HA! Then I sit there until about 3pm. From thereit was off to... Get my haircut, Bought two Triple 5 Soul shirts, and thennnnn it was to the crib to get my records. So me and Phil are hauling ass down to AUTUMN SETZ but of course we couldn't find it. So anyways I get there with like 30 minutes to spare before my set. That's where things got all fucked up. There were supposed to be 4 area's of sound, but instead there were only 2. So everyone's set was pushed back. Like way back. So I go on around 5am, and I'm like halfway into my set and this little pick comes up and is like ""Ok were all tagging now."" So I asked him who he was and he got a little louder (keep in mind this kid is my age but like 5 feet tall) and he says ""it's my sound system."" What a bama.... It's kinda like it's my ball and if I can't play too then I'm gonna take it home... So Phil dropped three house records, then it was my turn with mini me next... For some reason I just didn't like the way that he broke up my set. ""Asshole mode"" turned on,  what can I say. I dropped two house records, one of them was by Charles Feelgood, and I can't remember the other one, but for my third track I dropped one of my tightest tracks. ""Ghetto Dope"" - Pimp Hand Army Productions (Master P remixed to a break.) Anyways it's on of the hardest tracks to mix, and even harder to mix it from house and then back into it. So since mini me wanted to be a bama I made him train wreck in front of everyone.... I dont care he fucked up my set time, and in the middle of my set for that matter... I would be willing to bet that he will never cut anyone off again like that in the middle of their set....

NOW THE REST OF THIS IS WHAT I NEED HELP WITH..... OPINIONS PLEASE!!

So me and Melanie have been off and on like a damn light switch... She gives me mixed signals and I just take it because I love her. Ok I might not need that much help with this because I can hear myself typing it... So anyways she acts one way then as sson as something more worth her time comes along, I'm back to being no one in her life again. mmm mmm Makes me feel good! HA!

To make a long story short I have found out everything that I need to know about her. She told this kid that she liked that the reason that she didnt come see him was because I hit her and she had to call the cops on me and some other bullshit. My boy gave me a copy of the letter... Yo!! She can't just be truthful for shit. It's funny how I saw her earlier in the day and we can make love but she tells someone else that I hit her. Damn she really needs to get a grip. 

So I call the kid tonight because she is mad at me for finding out all this shit, and she starts rthreating me telling me that ""Andy is going to come after you with a bat and fuck your world up."" Please I'm Charles. So I did what I would always do. ""I stand up to the threat."" I don't let anyone threaten me. So I call him and he was like ""I figured it was a lie, I kind of sensed the other day that she was'nt all there. That something was missing upstairs."" I was like WOW didn't expect that one! I then continued to explain to him how much me and Melanie do see one another. He basically said that he was just tryin to stay cool with her, that he didnt want her like that, now that he knew all that he had... Honestly in a way I feel bad for some reason. But when I think about how I sat by myself on December 31st 2004 (which was our 1 year anniversay, my 24th birthday and New Years Eve/Day all at the same time) and she went to see him instead of me, then I definately don't care how she feels. 

These are her words to him thatshe sent...and someone gave it to me...
""Date: Sep 19, 2004 06:31 PM 

I don't not love you anymore ... I still love you ... ""I had an incident with my stupid ass abusive ex at like 4am ... not only did I have to tolerate his idea that he has the right to hit me, but I had to call the cops at 4am and deal with the issue during the hours which I wished I could be sleeping. I finally got back to sleep at like a little after 5, after my rude awakening by him at like 230. I know we were supposed to do the wine thing ... I know I fucked up again. I'm sorry. I don't know why I suck so much. I wish I didn't.""  <---- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT SHIT!!!!!!

To make it even worse, that's not even the first time time that she has done something like that. When I went to jail about a year and a half ago, she told Smurf that I threw her out of our second story window of our house in DC, and that's why she didn't have the baby. <---- WTF? and she did all that just so he wouldn't add me as his friend on fucking Friendster!!! WOW!!! 

Ok I hope that you didn't think that was all I had to say... So today I find out that she is just randomly passing out pictures THAT I TOOK OF HER DURING SEX to just whoever. That's the part that really fucked me up... On top of all that she gave them to this bama Kat.. She knows he's a bama too. I think she just goes after whoever will take her, that needs to be something she should talk to a shrink about I think.... I was like why would you go showing off your body like that to just anyone, ecspecially when you have someone right here that loves you, every bit of you, more than anyone in this entire world. Why would you do that? It can't be for attention, because that's all I do when I see her is give her all of my attention. The scariest part about it is I know that she fucked him and I don't know how many other people she has had sex with in the past two or three months. That just scares the shit out of me!!! All I can say is that I'm glad I never gave her any of the videos, HA she would probably have them on the store shelves at the MVC.... Who knows.....

Still not done...Further more I found out that Melanie and my child's mother Jessica have been fucking talking... WOW... Life is fucking hilarious. No matter what I do I can't ever seem to get people to just get the hell out of my life. Like why in the hell would she want to take the time to pry into my life and be all fucking nosey... She wrote Melanie this long ass letter telling her how my mom was a bad mother and how I used to beat her up while she was pregnant. HA!! Thats why she was the one who got in trouble.. All I can say is that I'm far far far from perfect and I'm a little crazy. So why try to or why do things AT ALL that you know are going to push my buttons.. Pregnant woman are crazy!!! Anyways I'm not going to talk all bad about her and say this and that or whatever, I just think it's funny that no matter how much time goes by there are always still people that are all up in my buisness. I'm sayin she's maried now with three kids at the age of 24, with a husband that is only home on the weekends. I would think thats enought o keep you busy... Guess not

So what I'm trying to figure is what should I do now. I'm a little mad at myself for not seeing all of this the whole time, from the begining, but when you love someone, you don't go worrying about all of that, because you're in love. She sold my records to Proxxy and I had to buy MY records back from him. The worst part is, there is so much stuff that she did something with it, I just seriously doubt that I will ever see it again. All I know is that she has fucked me over time and time again, whether it be 7 or 8 hundred dollars to my heart being broken, I'm still loving her for some damn reason. She has liked so many guys, and she has went out of her way to do things for them and neglecting to keep it real with those that keep it real with her (MYSELF i'm refering to) I could just name people off the top of my head.... Kevin, Steve, Peter, Rob, who knows how many more there are but, do you catch what I'm saying? If you have someone that loves you with all of their heart and they think of you as their world, and you just look right on by then there has got to be something wrong with you, simple as that. Sometimes I feel like she has just forgotten about all of the good times weve shared and the things weve been through, like being pregnant.. I do so much for her, I'm everywhere around her, ""ruckus"" I bought that cat for her. Her phone, I bought that $379 for a phone ande I just gave it to her. I used to take her record shopping and let her get atleast a hundred dollars worth of vinyl and she doesn't even take the time to spin.

So basically hears my dilemma, I feel used like shit! I've been taken advantage of by her too many times, but now I'm sitting here thinkiing about all the other shit she has done, and she has done nothing to try to repay me for things, or to even do something to make it right. She just doesn't care. I just need to figure out what I should do... Hopefully by the morning...

Ok that's definately enough for tonight..."

"event","I'm nervous about tonight... I don't know why... I think it's because so many people are going to be coming to support me... I shouldn't be though I've done this so many times before... I've done all I can do though... I have a good set planned out and my music IS great... I think it's just because I don't want to fuck up and have everyone hear me... I've said it so many times that I deserve the chance to show some people (that I will let remain nameless) that I am better than they are... So I guess now is my chance... It figures that they would be coming out tonight to hear me spin... Fuck it, I have it in my head that tonight I am going to rock... I'm going to drop shit that makes people dance and that's it! No fuck ups, only phat ass beats, nice cuts, and ol'skool breaks! I know I can do this! I was @ Capitol City Records the other day for about four and a half hours with no fuck ups. I know that I can do this for one hour..

I'm just thankful for all of the people that are making it out to support me tonight... People are coming out of nowhere that I haven't talked to in a minute... Momentum is coming too. I'm going to drop his track somewhere in my set to show some love...

Yo I just wanted to say what's up to everyone out there that keeps shit reaL!! 
 I've been getting alot of support lately from everyone and that means alot to me.....

 So... If you are one of these people that I'm talking about Thanks For real!!

I've been bitching about not hearing any good breaks lately, and last night was worth the wait. I heard some of the sickest basslines I've ever heard. I think last night even changed my perception on NU'skool breaks. When they are spun well they sound amazing!!!

Court went ok yesterday...
Melanie actually told my lawyer that she didnt want me to get into trouble. I'm like then why in the hell did you press the charges in the first damn place? Anyways I have to go to jail in October for 15 days. That does suck though. I guess it's not that bad though.

No time to put them all down right now.

"event","Life has been phun lately!
I got soo drunk the other day starting at 2pm,,, shhh don't tell no one... :]
Great Falls was a blast! Thanks for the fun day! ;]

Some people are so fake though. Then when it comes down to it they just never admit when they are even so much as partially wrong! That shit is phunny to me! Amor Fati! Ha please! I'm not even going to get into it, all I will say is that YOU are pathetic. Name one other person in this world that would let another man grab on their girls ass and take it in stride. The only person that would ever let that happen is someone that just does'nt care about the person that they love. Hmm O WELL it's definately your loss. Find someone better. The only reason you have been getting all of this attention is because I gave you the time of day. Watch and see, you will. I promise that much....

Do I sound bitter?  Just preterbed that's all. You took some clowns side that doesn't call you or spend time with you or invest in a relationship with you, over me. He flicked me off, I warned him not to do it. He did it again. That's why his ass got the shit smacked out of him. Anyone that says ""fuck you"" to me is open to having the same experience. That's just how I am.

Someone threatened me the other day and ummm well anyone that knows m just knows that I don't take threats too kindly and I am definately not the one to sit around and let people get away with it.. Let em keep it up, the old Charles will come out and, to be honest I don't even want that. Nuff Said......"

"event","First off I just wanna say that I had another wonderful night with my baby!! I love Doh with all of my heart! She's awesome and we make a great couple. We both are there for one another and we give one another support. That means the world to me. I'm just thankful that I am finally able to be treat like a person instead of something, well lets just say other than I have had to put up with. I'm so happy with her, she give me all of the attention I so require and I give it right back to her. Finally someone that cares for me, for me. Feel me?

I really can't believe someone is blaming me for their hard times. This is what she  said (""karma comes around like a MOTHERFUCKER, so it's safe to say ... you can kiss those A's goodmotherfuckingbye."") So now I'm just going to set the record straight.

1.  You  fucked me over on my birthday/Newe Years Eve/1 Year Anniversary
2.  You are the one who fucked your roommates, then they fucked you, OVER! I told you!
3.  You wrecked your car because your a fuckin drug addict.
4.  Rob changed his number just like you did it to me. Karma LOL!
5.  You failed school because you are too interested in drugs!
6.  Your life is a result of your actions.
7.  You stole from me on Valentines day, Now people are fucking you over.
8.  Rob doesn't want you in his life because he is trying to go somewhere with his.
9.  You lost your house because you don't have a job.
10  You need to realize that it's your life and there is no one else to blame but you.

KARMA IS A BITCH!!! YOURS IS ONLY BEGINGING!!!

I could go on and name a million other things that you dont think I know about but, since I am Charles, people just happen to tell me everything. BUT!! I'm not going to, I'm only going to keep being there for you, JUST LIKE I ALWAYS HAVE. It's time to  grow up, you're not a little girl anymore. You're almost 22. Time to enter reality.
As far as my staright ""A's,"" I never thought I would say this to you, but go over there and get one of those ""H's"" and put it on your back now. Congrats!! You are now a certified hater!! 

WOW!! I am soo glad that I have quit with the drugs. People tend to get a little retarded! Anyways next subject!!!!

Hmmm, I took Pictures at transit last night. My fucking camera kicks ass!! I'm looking forward to taking more.

Ok now I definately need to go to sleep because I am deeeerunk! Plus I have to go to work @ 11am. Hmmm Doh was definately, ""slightly intoxicated when she left my house. I hope she made it home ok. Damn I love that girl!!"

She said.... I'm through with beer now and it's all your fault. :)

I thought I was through with all of the drama and bullshit. But as always, people that don't know me talk about things that they just dont know about. I say if you don't know someone's last name, don't talk shit about them. If you can't be so much as personal enough to know someone's last name you don't know them well enough to speak about them and they're life. No one on this earth is perfect!! Fucking bama ass clowns.

The past 4 days.... Shitty
School..... I'm lovin it just gotta make it to all my classes.
Happiness.... Is fading

I dont get it, why do people act the way that they do? I swear if I let one more silly ass girl in to my life and my heart, and I get screwed over..... I can't believe she blew me off to chill with her ""best friend."" It's funny though how he blows her off to go chill with his signifigant other but when he puts his 3 cents in about our relationship (that he knows nothing about might I add) His fucking opinion is more important than the way I feel about my fucking relationship. The fucking queer doesn't even know me! Who in the hell is he to judge me?? After all he is the one with a dick in mouth! Ha the Nerve of some people.....

Someone else I still care about is having the hardest time right now, with everything, and I just want to be there for her, but I can't. Even if I could I don't think that ""I could."" Too many good and bad memories are at stake and then my emotions get all mixed up and then I'm fucking retarded all over again. All I can say is I am here for her and I always will be. It's funny how things happen. Once you share so much with someone I guess there is certain things that will always be there to lean on when you need it.... Am I making sense?

On to Doh... :/ I just don't get it... I don't know what to do. She's being a total bitch to me and saying things like she is not even affected by the proposed out come of her own words should they be turned into actions. She did tell me that she loved me and she was soooo all about me and now all because we had a bad weekend and she and I are both stubborn people she we can't get past this stubbling block... All I want is to be hapy with her again! Granted it's been a short while that we have been dating but I love so many things about her and she acts like I'm nothing now..... What to do? I'm dizzy!

I saw Chrissy today. Somethings never change, not that it's a bad thing; I'm just glad that I have changed. I really don't think I could handle ""that Life"" anymore. It scraes me now and I'm just thankful that I am strong enough to step away from it and to stay away from it. I see so many people just ruining their lives and they just dont care. I used to be like that but now that I am doing something for myself, well, everything just looks different and greener on this side... :/ :)

Hmm school, I love it and I just love learning again. I had forgotten how much I liked school! I'm doing well and I am getting good grades. I'm working for that associates... It may only be an associates for now but it will get me making anywhere from $25-$150 an hour.... Remember I want my 911 Turbo in Silver!! :) Soon Charles Soon! 

All in all life is good! I just wish I hadnt trusted someone so much with my feelings and let them in the way I did. I mean it would have been different if I were'nt hurting right now but now, NOW; This sucks.... No fucking wonder I have trust issues.....

"event","This is one of the worst feelings that I have ever had in my life. Last night I was all alone and had nothing to do but...be all alone. Anyways I got to thinking about a few things and then it hit me like a ton bricks. I was thinking about Melanie and why she would be feeling sick alot lately and then it hit me. Morning Sickness. But she would have to be pregnant to get that. 
	This is why I think she is pregnant.
1. On Valentines day I called her out on being pregnant and she answered in her ""i'm caught"" voice but she was denying it.
2. She stole a very large of amount of $ or equal to $. For what?
3. Change in behavior
4. Mood swings as well as decisions that she has made as far as our relationship are one way one week then she does the other the next week.
5. She is not a drinker and lately she has been drinking as much as possible
6. No more nose use only capsules.   (tearing up her stomach)
7. The other night when we were arguing she decided to take a bunch of pills like tylenol pm and thats just more shit for her to fuck up her stomach with.
8. constant bleeding for the past 2 months

Plus if she has an ulcer, why would she be drinking, capsules, tylenol pm,  what the helll?

This will be the second time that she is pregnant by me and this will be the second child she has killed. The doctors told her that if she were to miscarry again then she might not be able to ever have children. What the fuck is this girl thinking? Then to top it all off I had to figure it out all by myself. SHE DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME THAT SHE WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE...."

I did promise to let the bygones be bygones, but there are some things that are hard to just forget about. We ended the arguing with the begining of some really great sex. I love having it with her, she's a good girl at heart and a freak in the bed. She just needs to learn how to take more if she's soooo into this and that or whatever, anyways thats a whole different story. So after having sex for a good hour and a half, I'm laying on the bed about to do another line, or thinking of doing another line, but whatduya know i fall asleep. She was studying when I was drifting off ands the shit was right there on the table........
	........only to wake up and find that she had left on Valentines Day and stole 4 grams from me. Why in the hell would you take that from me on this day? Do you really hate me. Damn now that I',m thinking about it all over again, you really do hate me....... WTF? 
	If that doesn't say ""I love you"" I don't know what is......Thanks Melanie, your're breakin my heart girl and I don't even care......

<P>""If you are going to go for anything you should probably go for God,<BR>its reliable or whatever, but the biblical god is very strange I think<BR>cause he is quite hostile, he is always<BR>wreaking wrath and revenge and other things starting with 'rrr' and<BR>jesus is much more mellow, approachable sort of person, you know,<BR>robes, beard speaking in very loose terms and he must have been very<BR>annoying terms too because he always spoke in parables which would be<BR>a bit irritating if you were in a hurry ... 'Jesus, do you want a<BR>beer?' ... ' There once was a man who lived in an attic and he was<BR>growing seeds but the light came in from the left and in the end he<BR>was strangled by his own trousers'. 'so you don't want a beer'.. my<BR>favourite jesus story , the big jesus number is the fishes and the<BR>loaves number, you know it is a very big thing, jesus came over the<BR>hill he didn't like hotels and everyone one was coming from miles<BR>around going 'Jesus, Lord teach us, teach us just please teach us..<BR>and some snacks' kind of a package weekend and jesus went 'fish and<BR>chips.. now take it away' now that is a great story but the thing<BR>about great stories is that they tend to get exaggerated, so what<BR>probably happened originally was that Jesus was in his flat, there<BR>were a few people around and they were all a bit mashed and they went<BR>into the kitchen and there was just a bit of toast and sardines or<BR>something and they all went 'come on, for fuck's sake, this is shit, I<BR>am starving, come on, do the jesus thing and he went 'no no,<BR>shhhhhhhhh, take yourselves out to the pation, I will sort it out' and<BR>he went and found some tomato sauce and maybe a bit of cheese and made<BR>quite a good thing considering and brought it in and they all went<BR>'yeah, you are the lord, you have the remote control' you have to<BR>change stories to make them interesting...if someone comes up to you<BR>and says 'i went out and got really drunk cause I fell down and hurt<BR>my leg' you might laugh cause it might be your best friend.. but when<BR>you tell someone else you change it so you don't look like an arse,<BR>say 'Did you hear about Brenda she went out she got really drunk she<BR>fell down and hurt her leg and opened up an antique shop' and when<BR>that person goes and tells someone else it because something else<BR>again 'did you hear about Brenda she was out all night drinking heroin<BR>out of a hot water bottle, fell down on a burning sword and exploded<BR>into a million bits and she was attacked by these two tiny dwarves<BR>made entirely out of celery and spider sperm and they were throwing<BR>this big tin foil otter that they had stolen of a bus full of school<BR>children who were smuggling chutney across the mexican border in their<BR>heads and then they were all chased down a chocolate well and drowned<BR>in a big pool of dentist's piss""</P>

<P>i am however working today as i am covering ntashas shift tonight because of her biology trip. They are collecting bugs. and they laughed at me for measuring 60rocks!! muewhahahaha </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""i keep haveing these weird demented and wrong dreams. i mean really wrong dreams""> </P>
<P>In this dream I was being held captive on another planet. The people of this planet were in bondage to false ideas about God.<BR><BR>Early in the morning I was taken to a private meeting with the leader of this planet. We were alone in a large, clean unfurnished room. A single guard stood outside the open door.<BR><BR>By some means I had been paralyzed so that I could neither pray nor speak nor think straight. I was standing in the middle of the room in this strange, paralyzed state. I had no consciousness of the passage of time.<BR><BR>In the dream, Dr. Spock (of Star Trek fame) came to the door of the room and requested permission to enter. It is possible that I was captain of the Enterprise, though I do not know this for certain. I do know that I was from earth, as the following dialogue will attest. <BR><BR>After obtaining permission, Spock entered the room carrying a bucket of what appeared tro be a powdered cleanser. He stumbled and pretended to spill the cleanser on me accidentally. Immediately, I found myself released from my paralysis and I started to pray, standing by a wash basin with my eyes closed. (It was one of those chrome sink basins that you find in painting studios at college.) <BR><BR>Upon seeing my fervent attempt to pray the leader of the planet was in stitches with laughter. He asked what I was doing.<BR><BR>I said I was praying to God.<BR><BR>""This is hysterical!"" he said. ""We would never pray to God like that,"" and he wanted to know how I got the notion that I could talk to God.<BR><BR>""God came to our planet once,"" I said.<BR><BR>""God came to your planet? What was God like?"" The leader was suddenly interested in hearing this new thing. ""What was God like?"" <BR><BR>""He came to our planet as a human.""<BR><BR>""A human? A weak, pitiful thing like that? A human! God came to your planet as a human?""<BR><BR>""He took the form of a human, a man, actually, and lived on our world, on earth.""<BR><BR>""And what happened?""<BR><BR>""We killed him,"" I said.<BR><BR>I wake.<BR></P>"

the lyrics to the moomins theme song

<h3>The Moomins</h3>

Here they are for one and all, the Moomins are about to call,
Come and sit down here with me, they're here for you on your tv, 
they are the moomins, they are the moomins.
Come with me give me your hand, I'll take you off to moomin land,
you can fly just like a bird or sing the best song ever heard, 
they are the moomins, they are the moomins, they are the moomins.
Bah ba ba bah ba ba ba bah to end
At end of show
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomins,
They're always happy and always at play, the Moomins are having fun day after day,
they were The Moomins, they were The Moomins, they were The Moomins."

Through blistered avalon
The sky's cruel torch
On aching autobahn
Into the uncertain divine
We scream into the last divide
You make me real
You make me real
Strong as I feel
You make me real
Sheila rides
On crashing nightingale
Intake eyes
Leaves passing vapour trails
With blushing brilliance
Alive
Because it's time to arrive
You make me real
You make me real
Strong as I feel
You make me real

Discard my friends
To change the scenery
It meant the world
To hold a bruising faith
But now it's just a matter of grace
A summer storm
Graces all of me
Highway warm 
Sing silent poetry
I could bring you the light
And take you home
Into the night
You make me real
Lately I just can't seem to believe

<i> in a town called mallice, oooooooo yeaaahhh!!</i>

thank fuck last week is over

today is tuesday and i successfully spent all yesterday in bed smoking and watching tv and occasionally gaining inspiration to do my CC and Geog lol. i finished them both at about 11.30 after i had another fight with my sister, the outcome; she threw my cordless supermouse at the wall and it died. i went mad and mum took her side. FUCKER. 

i am going on my geography trip next wednesday to stand in a river till friday! YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! we went last year in my old school and had to wear wellie boots that sit up round your tits lol. 

talking of wellie boots, a girl  came into my work on saturday wearing multicoured flowery ones and they were so cute. i may participate in buying funky wellie boots *hrmmm*

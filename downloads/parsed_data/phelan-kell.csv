I left work an hour early today, because I could. I got to Southmall approx 4:30, which is fucking excellent. I left the train station, crossed towards the shopping center to get some salami. I was half way crossing and the woman in a car headed towards my right (ie far side of the crossing) decided that she would first make eye contact, second decide to drive regardless of me and other's already crossing, third actually perform the action of driving through a crossing.

I chased her down.

She stopped to drop off some vids at the Civic video 100m around the corner. I caught her as she left the store. I confronted her with her own stupidity (too bad stupidity isn't painful!). The conversation was mostly one sided, and I can't remember the details fully, but I didn't swear or go nuts as I often have thought that I should. I did consider slashing her tyres, but thought better of it (i.e. TAB next door to the video store full of drunks may try be heroic or something).

Her reasoning for driving through a crossing; ""there were too many people comming I had to go.""

I reminded her that you <i>never</i> drive through a crossing if there are people there, and that if the timing were slightly different then she could have taken me out. I pointed out that I have a child and who would explain what happened to daddy. Guilt trip, but she deserved it.

As I started moving away I said something like ""please don't do this again, and study the fucking road code"" which was the first time I had sworn, and perhaps for objectivity I shouldn't have. I walked away, and just had a ""fuck you!"" yelled at me. I think she was too stunned to say anything else. She was clearly off-guard.

Regardless, it was a rush, and strike one for the pedestrian!"

"event","It may sound odd, but I've been scowering the intarweb for educational games for the mac. Preferably ones that are free, and don't need much hardware. Having said that, even comercial titles will run on this machine - G4 450, 256mb, flower power iMac. The reason? Lilly keeps banging on my keyboard!!! She needs a machine of her own, so she can play. She'll also come waddling down to the computer room, push the chair so I spin around 90 degrees, and she climbs up into my lap so she can get at the computer. Strange little midget. At least she isn't hitting the reset key anymore!

So, how you doin'?

The weekend was fun; Friday was spent washing the outside of the house. Saturday I spent jizzing in a hard ware store (I love the way that hardware stores will even sell Bata Bullets!!!), and Saturday night was spent at Vector Arena watching the Smashing Pumpkins and Queens of the Stone Age.

Now, I don't know QOTSA as well as I'd like to, so I don't think my opinion can be trusted. To me, they wern't as interesting as the Pumpkins. Now, the Pumpkins... There were perhaps 20 people there older than me that I saw. I haven't seen that much teenage illegal ass since high school! Anyway, there is no elabourate way to review a gig like the pumpkins; it wasn't very good. If the band had stuck to the songs the way they were performed on the albums, and Billy Corgan didn't try wank for the audience with massive guitar solos that bore you shitless, then it would be far better. 

I'm sorry, but I'm actually a bit pissed about that. I stood for FIVE HOURS. I paid about a hundred and twenty dollars. All for a concert that was just ""welcome to the Billy Corgan show.""... Such presumption and arrogance... But I plan to marry the keyboardist.

And I don't really have much else to say. Yes I'm still watching Lost, yes I'm really waiting for BSG to start again, yes I'm pissed there are no Heroes episodes until September, and yes I can't wait for more Dexter or Chuck. Mmmm TV."

And I swear I've done nothing... I've been trying to rip out a tune tree and flax bush from the back yard. My back is sunburnt like a lobster. I needed a break from my break on monday so I went to work. I got Lilly a paddling pool. And thats about it.

I've realised daytime tv sucks - Dr Phil can suck lefty. The pommy guy on tv2 they play for hours at a time is terrible, infact he can suck righty. They don't do anything to help the situation, they can't cause they don't know the situation, but when they figure out enough they will lynch the fucker. Apart from that, they just rark up the situation.

Having said all that, I have been able to watch Bionic Woman, Terminatior: Sarah Connor Chronicles, and some other fun stuff. And the news is proving mightily interesting. Hone Harawira wanting the NZ government to apologise to Maori, like what the Aussies just did to the Aboriginal people. Now, lets look at it this way:
<ul><li> NZ has not had a systematic policy of removing Maori children from their parents. </li>
<li> Anything to apologise for was before any of our life times, and better known as a time ofwar. </li>
<li> we have our own reparations, called the Waitangi Tribunal. </li></ul>
Having said all that, if we were going to go down the path of apologies, I want one from the Maori. I want apologies for the following:
<ul><li> Every protest they've launched without thinking it though </li>
<li> Donna Awatere Huata, activist then MP and then convicted for fraud </li>
<li> Being too stupid to understand how the foreshore and seabed act helps all NZ'ers </li>
<li> Tuku Morgan's undies </li>
<li> Billy T James. </li></ul>

Work seems to be holding out on giving me a pay rise that I was informed verbally would come about now, 12 months since my last review.

IRD have decided that I will earn 2k more this financial year than previously thought, so they've reduced my Working for Family payments by 30%. Now, yes I am going to earn that 2k more than previously thought, but only by random, once off jobs. Its not my normal income thats changed.

Inlaws fowarded on rates bills (water and council) last week, and because they waited so long I had 3 days to pay them in. And because I haven't had a consistent idea of how much the rates are (quarterly? Thats a bitch to budget!), the $380 came from my parents, who I had just paid back for the last loan. Rates are rediculously expensive!!!

Life Insurance payments have started comming out, without notice that they were going to start. ffs.

And then we dented grandma's car the other day...

The end result is, I basically don't have any spare cash. Everything goes on bills. I even have to stop giving Sharon cash to get herself and Lilly stuff.

I'm still working on that fucking website, and I really don't care about it anymore.

and so I'm going to have to rent out the spare room. But before I can do that, the inlaws have to get their stuff out of the studio, so we can get our stuff in there!




shoot me now.




there are some good bits however. Lilly had a fantastic weekend at the zoo on saturday (mum paid), and butterfly creek on sunday (work paid). I did get paid for some website stuff, and got myself new ipod classic 80gb (though in hind-sight that was perhaps a bad move), and I have a new 20"" ws monitor, from a promotion from a suplier. Also have a Wii on the way, not that we can play it because I can't afford to mod the damn thing.

And theres BSG. oooooooh baby!

On Wednesday I had a phone call to say my Grandmother has had a stroke - a particularly severe one. She was on double morphine, but recovered a bit and gained conciousness around lunch time today, but has since gone down hill. She was able to point to her ear to show she couldn't hear anything, and she smiled, but because of the stroke she can't eat or drink anything. So she'll pass beyond the grey sometime in the next week.

I've known this was comming for a while. She's 92!! You just don't live forever, as much as you might want to, or as stubborn as she is might decide to. Mum reckons some time in the next week. So, I'll be off to Wellington sometime soon. Which means I might actually deliver a copy of The Tongan Ninja to <lj user=""nutcake"">, and take episodes of Flight Of The Conchords to my sis.

Doped up on Neurophen seems to inspire me to type. Or, perhaps its the lack of the tv that does it. The TV died almost two weeks ago, but they replaced the transformer and so it started to work again. But, the graphics will move an inch to the left at certain times (not random, because it depended on what was displayed, eg if it was paused at the right moment...) Anyway, its off being repaired again.

But doped up on neurophen is because of something else. Was it too much to drink last night? Or was it the lack of air conditioning at work? Who knows. Students have feinted, machines have crashed and burned, power has been knocked out to the server room (and the circuit breakers aren't logical so the UPS didn't last long..)... It took me a day and a half to do two hours worth of work this week.

This time, a movie review. Back up three weeks ago was my birthday, and I got many DVDs. :D I had preordered Babylon 5: The Lost Tales back in June, and ordered Free Enterprise at the same time, so I got Free Enterprise almost immediately since it was available. The Babylon 5 DVD only started selling on July the 26th, the day before my birthday, so they'd have to pack and send that out and I end up waiting ages. The other two movies I'll review are The Tongan Ninja, and Kaikohe Demolition, which I got with a $30 Borders gift voucher from work. Go work!

<b>Babylon 5: The Lost Tales</b>
<img src=""http://www.trekweb.com/images/stories/464bc08eda188-1.jpg"">
Its been a long time since the show ended, and these two short stories are really part of a plan to bring it back. How to bring it back has been a question for quite some time, and since the show ended two of the major actors have died, its that much harder to make a full series or movie. So, short story!

<lj-cut text=""not spoilers, but my opinions which may contain spoilers"">Now, those are the key words, SHORT STORIES. The two short stories fit into that mould perfectly. You don't have the time to add in other secondary plots, ten years of back story, further character development: you focus on the story at hand. I thought they did it well.

The effects were brilliant, it was like, seeing an old favourite in an entirely new light. I thought the effects inside the station (i.e. corridors, etc) were a bit underdone, and the variety of sets were lacking. Like, holding a prisoner in a cell where you can't monitor them, no monitoring station, no guards, etc... Okay it was cheap when they made sets, but I guess, it fits the short story mould well, of being cheap.
In the end, I liked it, but it won't be replacing End Game or Severed Dreams or And The Rock Cried Out as favourite chapters of the story.</lj-cut> Most memorable quote: ""Was that a new dress?""

<b>Free Enterprise</b>
<img src=""http://img.search.com/thumb/0/00/FreeenterpriseDVDscan.jpg/180px-FreeenterpriseDVDscan.jpg"">
Funny in parts, seeing The Shat rapping (and reading porn!) was brilliant in how cringe worthy it was, and I don't think I need say any more... Oh wait, yes: did anything actually happen? I spent the whole movie waiting for something to fricken happen. Grr.

<b>Tongan Ninja</b>
<img src=""http://www.dvdverdict.com/images/covers/tonganninja.jpg"">
Awesome in most regards, but I don't think its a ""watch by yourself"" movie. You need a group of friends (or even just one) and perhaps some beer and chips. The extras were brilliant! Its as cheesy as the name suggests, but they obviously put a lot of work in on a very tight budget. Well worth it if you're having a movie night.
Memorable quote: ""I'm the P.I."" 
""Oh, the Private Investigator!""
""No, the Pacific Islander!""

<b>Kaikohe Demolition</b>
<img src=""http://www.lumiere.net.nz/reader/media/images/dvd_kaikohe_a.jpg"">
Not specificly a movie, but a real slice of life. Mum and Dad served in the Police in Kaikohe before I was born, so it was interesting seeing why they got the fuck outta dodge. Its great in that I'd feel comfortable watching it with anyone (no profanity in the doco) and what these people get up to for fun is brilliant: think red-necks with a bit o' balls and kiwi ingenuity. It was fun, worth the watch, and easy on the other grey meat.
Memorable quote: ""He makes the cars run good, even if they're really patu!""


So yeah, those are my recent movies. All brought for me as or with birthday presents. Which is kind of a sore subject, as even less people remembered this year than previously. In a way though, it wasn't as bad as 2002 I think, where I went to Dennys and they said I can't have the free meal because I didn't have anyone else with me who was paying..."

Anyway, the important part was Transformers. I know I'm slow on getting to these things, but the wait was worth it. I went in not thinking it was going to be very good, I expected cheesy crap honestly, and I was given a fun movie with plot holes that Optimus Prime could drive through. Have to say, the effects were outstanding, and the way they moved like real people... Can anyone say sequel?

Anyone know a good way to get rid of an annoying person who keeps calling you on the phone? Is changing my phone number a good idea or too drastic."

Not much to report, I am about to start an exercise routine, mainly due to Sharon buying me some nice pants, in my aparent size, yet I can't quite squeeze in them properly. I've put on 10kg in 12 months, and I'd love it if anyone could contact me with recommendations for weight loss website, or dietry advice sites, etc.

Been working alot via laptop of late, and I'm having real problems seeing these CRT computer screens on my normal machine. I think I'll have to buy a new machine, soon, or get work to buy me one. My job at work may be changing, due to the cunt I work with handing in his resignation. Oh god I could write a litany about him. Anyway, I've identified a lack in the development of new and emerging technologies, such as e-learning and our intranet, when it comes to who the fuck does the work. I've suggest it be meeeee. This could mean a raise. :D

Sarah was up the other week... spent an hour or so pestering her, which was yay! cause I got to see someone. Twas incredibly sick though. Following that, Dad came up on tuesday because my grandma ended up in hospital. As they say, its often the carer who goes first. They're finally looking into a retirement village arangement, despite family nagging them for something like 10 years. Fingers crossed they will listen.

Till next time...."

Anyway, birthday party photos will be online sometime. Life is hectic. Had plumbers through today to fix up the toilet, dishwasher, etc. Great stuff eh! The dishwasher is going to make all the difference. I'm not exagerating, I will have free time, early dinners, and an evil monkey in my closet!

Watched Borat with Mum on Sunday night. Halerious. I would never have picked that movie to be watched with parents. Watched Free Enterprise last night, which wasn't as Shatner-y as I'd have liked, but still fun getting most of the jokes. And today I watched Bridge to Terabithia (pardon the spelling)... I didn't know that its a kids film at first, but quickly got the point. Another Made In New Zealand film! It was alright, fairly entertaining, and interesting seeing the T1000 / Mulder replacement acting along side Trillian, yet never actually acting with... There is like, one scene where they're in the same room."

"event","So the trailer is online for The Lost Tales... www.babylon5.com. This is years in the waiting, its been about five or six since the last attempt at a B5 series, and realisticaly its been 10 years since the show ended.

Other news, I feel I have to get something out. It will probably offend, but it is my opinion.

I'm not religious. I believe a few things, that mostly contradict mainstreem religion. I believe God, jesus, whatever you call them (I prefer Sheridan and Adama) are whatever you make them to be, inside your head. Carry them there, look to them for inspiration. If your god is a drugged out alchie called Bernard Black, so be it.

I also believe that religion has no part to do with the government, which is why I support Labour, and could support National now that Brash is out. I believe that once religion gets involved in government you start enforcing values from one religion on others. This is why I could never support a Destiny Church party, or a Christian Heritage Party. For any religion to declare their hatred of another group of people because of their beliefs, sexuality, race, etc is wrong. Government should support the choice of people to have a religion, but not select that religion for them.

Religion should be about acceptance, about the right to chose, to treat others fairly, as you yourself have made these choices!

The Destiny Church want christianity recognised as the New Zealand religion. Perhaps they don't like the values of Buddhists or Muslims. They want to the government to not ""defile New Zealand's soil with foreign religions""... Brian Tamaki, you're twenty years too fucking late. We've had people of other faiths entering NZ for years, just look at www.stats.govt.nz for the figures. Christians made up just over half the population in 2001, and I'd like to think that half of them are against this closed minded, arrogant train of thought that the Destiny Church subscribe to.

A few years ago, when the Civil Union Bill was before government, Destiny Church members marched through Wellington wearing all black, combat boots, shouting and waving their fists, screaming Enough Is Enough. One elderly man in the crowd was seen by the reporters at the time; He said it shot memories straight back to being in Poland during WW2...

The Destiny Church is a hate organisation. And mark my words, mark this moment, Brian Tamaki will go down the same way as Graham Capill, he'll be caught indecently assulting a minor. He'll be caught with a stack of kiddie porn in his den. And then those blinded followers will see the damage they've done."

I guess I could have taken the opportunity to post numerous times over the past month or so, but I haven't. Sharon went to see my parents for a week, which resulted in a weekend of Lego Star Wars for about, oooh, 18 straight hours in a bean bag.

My poop doesn't smell. Comes out in pretty colours, pastels. Denny Crane.

Speaking of which, does anyone here (old school mother fuckers yo') remember Wraith? I'm doing websites for his MUM. Which brings back memories of soo many taglines, such as ""He's very secretive isn't he?"" as said by his mum... ahh.

She said she wanted to fulfill every single one of my fantasies. I made a list. Had to type it myself. My assistant threatened to quit.

I could also have spent some time ranting and raving about the worst. Ads. Of. All. Time. Those Telecom family ads. Those Mobile ""Smart Toys"" ads. And the ""I look up, she looks down"" ad... Oh, they're all Telecom?! There is one good series of Telecom Ads; ferrit.co.nz.

See, I get up an hour later (which isn't really an hour later anymore since I've had two days to adjust), get to the train station 10 minutes early cause I'm more energetic because of the sleep, and then I get to work at 7:40am. The bitch is then, that I end up having minimal time for lunch, and I'm there an extra 20 minutes. Catch the late ""express"" train home, and wait in line at woolworths for 15 minutes. 

In the end, I wake up an hour late, I work an extra half an hour at work, get home half an hour later, and feel utterly shattered.

Built myself a computer desk in the weekend, yes I did! Am using it now. Two 19"" CRT monitors, one iMac, two keyboards, retractable keyboard tray, 3 pcs, one multifunction printer, and space for filing and important document folders. I rock! I Managed to tidy the boys room up completely, run network cabling under the house, clean all the floors, and start working on the shower.

Booked tickets for Sharon and Lilly yesterday, they're off to Wellington for a week. I can't remember when, but it means I have a week for walking around the house naked, drinking beer, and eating the finest of meals, for example toast and peanut butter. And if I want to really spash out, I'll add some cheese and salami to the toast. Mmmm. But yeah, Mum, Dad, and Grandma can all see Lilly, and its quite good today and tommorow, because the tickets are like $59 each way.

Am finding bloggers really full of themselves these days. I mean, they write their particular style because they believe that they have their style, they have a specialised blog site because ""if I write it they will read,"" and they have their little clique, and their private in jokes that their clique think are funny, and they think people really care what they think. Its border line ""My name is Michael Stipe, vocalist for REM, and I think we shouldn't hurt the environment"", or as Trey Parker and Matt Stone best said; ""Matt Damon!""... Get a life people, you're still working your same old job, go flip a fuckin pattie.

We recorded it with Camtasia to turn that into a resource to train those who were absent. I sounded like a muppet, I say Umm and Err too much, and because I was wearing the microphone you can't hear when people ask me questions.

Home is good. Lots of things are happening. Saturday I start building my computer desk: wood for it arrived today.

Someone has just started to smile... Yes she's a bit dribbly and still has
that red mark from the forceps on her forehead and down her nose.

She is far too big! Lillian is just long! We're having to start looking for
more clothes for her now. And it doesn't help that she's started pooping
double and eating triple... argh!

And as to the subject, some images just need the caption ""Denny Crane"" at
the bottom, perhaps with a cigar Photoshop'ed in. [$20 says fewer than three
of you understand that...]

you'll notice that there are some with me in there - I susupect they're the first of me since I lost weight. These were from the hospital, so about four weeks or so old. Shes getting big and bossy!</lj-cut>

Tommorow is my last day at Natcoll. I think they'll remember me as the grouchy quasi-tech that despite being over 25, still wanted to be the baddest motherfucker in the world. [subtle hint: read Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson, I am at the moment and its bloody fantastic]... Tommorow could be really messy as I'm supposed to finish off a heap of odds and ends, pub-o-clock for a short while, then haircut and home.

Really excited about monday however. New job! I may not be there for long, but it'll be a good stepping stone into something else. I think I'm ready to turn the stress and workload up a little."

"event","I'd just like to say for the record (for all those females out there who are spawning, or thinking of spawning) that it is actually really hard on us males too, this whole pregnancy thing. For example, you may have once been capable of many things, but most of these have to be taken over by the male.

Don't get me wrong, I totally appreciate the female position on this, you can't do anything about it, you can't do anything: you've got enough to do fending off kicks and punches all day long; and I'm not grouchy or critical of you or thinking any less positive than I always ever did. But if anyone says that us males have it easy, think again.

We effectivly become slaves to you: every want and need that you have, we fix. Should you decide that you want something in the middle of the night, done. Everything. 

And this is draining. I looked in my eyes at the gym tonight -- which I barely made it to -- and i saw the grey behind my eyes. I was dead, drained, exausted. And I hadn't worked out yet.

Interesting news:
<a href=""http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/"">Boot camp</a> has been released by Apple, allowing users to dual boot Windows XP SP2 and Mac OSX on an Intel based mac. Reviews and benchmarks are flooding in to the news sites. This is fantastic news. It means Apple sells hardware to those who think the machines are just too damn pretty, and now there is no excuse to switch to Mac. Microsoft can't complain, their OS on more computers, cool!

For me, it means when Lightwave 9 is released, all the features will be supported, and we can stick with our Mac labs and not change them to Windows. Changing to Windows had flaws, for example management of PCs takes alot more effort than Macs. And Final Cut Pro/Studio is Mac ONLY. We can't switch to Avid, purely because our courses are FCP/FCS-centic, and the Windows software to use is Avid, which sucks my hairy dogs cock. Besides, we sent one of our staff to Florida (right during Cyclone Katrina, too!) to become Apple Certified. We don't want to waste that mooola.

And Lionhead has been brought by Microsoft... <lj user=""sphanges""> did you see that?

Oh, and Summer Glau has pulled out of Armageddon in Wellington. Thats alright, I still get to get Kaylee signing ""I ain't had anything in six months to twix my neathers that wern't run on batteries!"" And Claudia Christiansen!

Off to do the dishes. Ciao."

DID SHE HAVE TO KICK ME OUT OF MY HAMMOCK LAST NIGHT?

She says she was in her room asleep all night, but I KNOW she kicked me!"

I'm not sure if Hoatzin's playing a funny trick on me, I guess if I wake up tomorrow and things are still the way they are, then it's true.

Shanks is here, in Bluefinger.  Seeing him for the first time in over ten years, it was <i>great</i>, I'm really happy, you know?  More than I can express.  I mean, he's like a father, only he taught me what it meant to be a pirate.

And still...  It's really stupid.  Nope!  Not thinking anymore!  This might all just be a weird dream anyway, and it's no good getting worked up over nothing.  Right?  Right!

<s>If I'm so happy to see him, why</s>
<s>What am I doing here?  Am I really going to find the way to become Pirate King in this pla</s>"

Sou ka.  Memories, huh?

Nami and Nojiko are becoming more like cats by the day.  Some curse that some spirit named 'Yoruichi' has to do with.  Nami puts on a brave face, but I think she's scared, whenever she remembers what she's forgotten.  Her dreams.  That we're nakama.

I won't let him!  They're my nakama!  Besides!  Arlen <i>likes</i> Nojiko and he tries hard to change for her.  I think that means something, right?  This 'Yoruichi' guy--who does he think he is, claiming other people's nakama?!  I'll send him flying, that bastard!

There was a curtain in her room.  She didn't want me to look behind it.  That does it.  If something related to that Yoruichi-guy is behind it, I'm throwing it in the sea!

Tonight."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Until We Meet Again, Take Care!  Edward Leaves Bluefinger!"">

Arm in a sling -- still sore from surgery -- Edward walks down the docks toward the Going Merry; a strange, solitary repeat of the event that got him into this. Still, he's in far better spirits then he was back then. He's going home today, and he's happy about that. And he's going... to. Well. You'll find out.
Standing at the base of the boarding plank, he looks up, and then slowly begins to head up, hoping for no repeats of last time. ""Luffy? Hey? Monkey boy! Where are you?"" He doesn't want to come ON the ship, not -- well, uninvited. So he stands there, looking a little lost.

Both shoulders have an arm -- that much is obvious.



Most of Luffy's bandages are gone, save for a few taped-down squares of white gauze that protect the wounds that had been deepest and were taking longer to heal.  It's definitely a good thing, because the summer heat and rolls of gauze covering the majority of one's skin made both unbearable in the combination.  As for the pirate, he's sitting up in the crow's nest, presently, being antisocial.  Well, antisocial because the crow's nest is typically occupied by only one person, and it makes conversation difficult.

However, it also makes spotting visitors really easy.  Luffy looks down at the call, pushing his hat up off of his eyes.  ""Ed!  What are you doing here?  They let you out already?!""

He clasps a hand to the edge of the crow's nest and drops down.  Hooray for rubber limbs!  They make good bungees.  Luffy walks over to greet him more properly, though it seems a little dull on exuberance this time.  It's not Edward, really; he's glad to see him.  ""Come on up.""



...bungee.

Edward's brow twitches as he watches RUBBER BOY drops downward, and then smiles, still shaking his head. ""I'm a terrible patient. I can't stand to be down long. So they have to let me out earlier or I make them unhappy."" Or he just up and leaves. He smiles at Luffy, then, offering his metal hand-- good to see you, pirate boy. You're looking better, and so is he. Not that anyone can see the stitches where /he/ has them. At least, where he still has them. SOME of them have since been removed, thankyouverymuch. 

""Hey,"" he says, after that brief pause for a grasp of hands, ""I'm headed back to the Hall, tonight. I'm a quick healer, Winry's ready to get out of here, and I don't think Al's very happy here."" It's time to head home. ""And I'm getting worried about my kids. So--"" he glances away, toward the west, and the hall. ""We'll be gone for a while. But -- uhm, in a few months... I hope, maybe sooner..."" he tilts his head and smiles. ""I'm hoping you'll come down for Winry and I's wedding.""



(( I'm a terrible patient. ))  Luffy grins.  ""So am I.""  Which means it's a good thing that the worst of his injuries have usually made him conk right out for a few days.  Gives Chopper plenty of time to patch him up without him aggravating injuries he took the time to take care of!  To the offered, metal hand, Luffy brings out his own to shake, firmly.

His hand next goes to the brim of his hat, giving it a small tug to adjust it.  Brows lift in surprise.  ""You're going already?""  Well, he won't stop him; if he wanted to go home, he wouldn't let fatigue or recent half-recovery keep him down.  Another way in which both share a trait?

Again, Luffy's expression blanks out to surprise.  ""You DID propose!!"" he blurts out, and then covers his mouth.  Quick!  Recover!  ""Uh, I mean.  I kind of suspected you would...""  He says sheepishly, scratching his cheek and glancing aside.  ""If you let me know where and when, I'll definitely show up!""  Unless something really crazy happens.  Like, REALLY crazy.  Only if nakama are in danger would he cancel.  Chances are, that won't happen.



A blink is given as Luffy's outburst flutters his bangs. Well, yes, he did. ""...Did Winry talk to you, before I did?"" he asks, lifting a brow. He shakes his head, chuckling a moment later. Poor girl has no faith in her boyfriend. ""Tsh!"" He says quietly, ""You'd think she'd have more faith in me! But-- ah, yeah. I did. Properly, without drugs."" HE grins, lopsided and cocky; the face of someone who is looking at the future with a sense of pleasant expectation, rather then worry and fear... a real happy face.

""Oh, don't you worry. Things go right, you might just be best man. Depends on how we arrange things with Al... Winry's father has been dead a long time, but someone that's-- family ought to give her away. I think... I would suggest that to her... But, you too--"" Luffy's nearly family, or at least, he's wheedled his way there... with meat and love. STrange how that works out.



Ohshit!  Think fast!  ...Wait, LUFFY?  THINK?!  HAHAHAHA--ahem.  Luffy looks a little sheepish, ""Well, uh, right after I talked to you, she hit me with a wrench.  We talked things out and I think we're okay now.""  There!  He can claim there was really no talk of proposals at all!  ""I stretch.  I hit things.  But when it comes to that... that...""  He waves a hand in a vague gesture, frustrated, ""That /stuff/,"" What, relationships? ""I'm more stupid than usual,"" he says, smiling.

He does doubletake, though, and points at Edward, his smile finally graduating into a grin.  ""THERE IT IS!""  What?  ""Hey, it looks good on you, wear it more often!  When you can.""  He must mean the happy face.  A genuine expression.  He likes it.

Meat and love AND BOOZE.  Don't forget the roadside kegger!  ""What's a best man?""  Uh, did we mention clueless?



Edward knows what Luffy means when he points out the smile, and he smirks in return. Yeah, yeah, yuck it up, rubber boy. But-- wait. ""Ah, uhm. A Best man -- is... the groom's right hand. He helps out some with the planning, and parties and things. And at the wedding, he stands by his side, to show his support, and that sort of thing. I could explain better... Maybe. But I've got some things to look up myself, like... how the hall does weddings."" HE shrugs, and then says, ""I'll come back to Bluefinger and we'll talk it over, okay?"" He reaches up and claps Luffy no the shoulder, shaking his head. Amused. Highly amused. ...And yes, booze.



He'll yuck it up, definitely! He loves genuine smiles when he sees them, and has the feeling something good was accomplished when he sees it on faces that rarely wear them. Luffy's kind of odd that way. <_<; ""...Shouldn't that be your brother, then?"" You know, the one in the biiiig armor! Wait, of course you know. Ahem. Planning? That's kind of scary. Luffy couldn't plan his way out of a wet paper bag--unless it's 'I hit it until it stops sucking' or something. ""...Okay! Come back and visit, don't make me track you down in Golden Hall. I'll be waiting."" A pause, and then: ""Oh yeah, you hungry? We have fresh steak."" Don't ask how.



""...steak?"" Edward is perpetually hungry. SOMETHING ELSE THEY SHARE. And he instantly <3 at food. But! No, he frowns. ""I don't think I can stay. Gotta get Winry and Al home so they don't go crazy."" But he shakes his head. ""Al and I can plan -- but still, I'd like you to be there..."" And help out a little in your unique, brilliant way. At least with Luffy in charge, Ed isn't giong to have to worry about, oh, you know -- things like... Bachelor parties. Luffy just won't know how to properly humilitate Edward with hookers, strippers or booze. Well, maybe booze. His idea of a good time probably involves booze and strange party games and lots of meat.



""..."" Aww, look! He's disappointed. ._.; But he's not going to push, especially not when he mentions that Edward's nakama are waiting up on him. Instead, he nods, grinning. ""Then ...a raincheck."" Unfortunately, Luffy doesn't know about bachelor's parties, or Edward might wind up with all manner of people showing up to drag him away for heavy drinking and gods know what else. Strippers and hookers? HAHAHA--no, Luffy's far too innocent for that! ""It'll be fun! I'll see you there.""

He starts to turn towards the door to the common room/upper deck of the ship, then stops. ""Oh yeah!"" Prepare yourself, Edward, for a Luffy-brand lunging hug. ""You take care of your arm!""



""Yeah, a raincheck. I'll be down again!"" ...Maybe sooner then he thinks. And maybe it's a blessing that Luffy doesn't know about those sorts of parties; he tends to get in trouble with women of ill repute. Lots of trouble! He's -- well. Yes. A clasp of the arms -- only to suddenly be in one of those back-cracking HUGS! and Edward groans. Okay, okay! PUT HIM DOWN HE NEEDS TEH OXYGEN!

Ooph. Settled on his feet, he wobbles a little. ""Yeah, well, it should be fine!"" He reaches out, again, clapping Luffy on the shoulder. ""And you get yourself back tow here you need to be. If you need /help/... don't hesitate to ask, okay? THat's what I came down here for, you know?"" Even though it seems like, with Luffy, all the lights are on now. Good thing; his lights are dim enough as it is, without having some bulbs burnt out.



They're on. Though truth be told, with every day that passes, the lights are getting dimmer. Those moments of near-catatonia don't occur quite as often, but when they do, they're lasting longer, they're harder to shrug off. There have been a few moments where Luffy felt like he was made of very dry rice paper. There were a few things recently that may have contributed to it; he's been active when he shouldn't, and--well, being unable to sleep probably aggravates things. But he certainly SEEMS fine! They just need to do something, and soon, or one day the crew might wake up and find he's simply... not there, unwillingly separated from nakama and ship.

And that would just suck, so he'd like to avoid that.

Edward is set down with a chuckle, a thumbs-up one-handedly to the clap on the shoulder. ""Yeah. Things'll work out. One foot forward all the time, right? If there's trouble, I'll let you know. Or a little bird might anyway."" Like Oilbird.



""Indeed,"" Edward says. Oilbird just might. Edward smiles at him, and then turns off, to head down the plank, his step light and his head high. He hasn't felt this good -- well, /ever/. He smiles bakc at the pirate ship, and then vanishes through the docks. He's gotta get back to /his/ nakama -- his family and kin. Braid bouncing over his shoulder, he goes to meet Ysabel elsewhere, climbing up onto the Aspiran's back and heading toward where he told Winry and Al he'd meet them."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Cat Problems and Catnip"">

When Luffy had returned to the Going Merry to load up a few barrels of... well, what formerly was called 'Daisy', he'd been asked by a dock worker why there were so many rodent and bird carcasses found near and around the ship. When Luffy shrugged and said 'Cat problems', the dock worker went back to his work, but his companion had misunderstood what kind of 'cat problems' Luffy was having, apparently having assumed he was referring to girl trouble. ""Carry around something she likes,"" had been his gruffly-spoken advice, which left the pirate very confused indeed.

What do cats like?

That's when it hit him. Catnip. Where do you get it? Usopp was busy, so he walked to the store. They didn't carry it, but pointed him at an herbalist, who gave him a few sprigs in exchange for a few coins and sent him on his way. That, currently, is in one pocket, carried like a token that would somehow ward off cat problems.

What he DIDN'T know is that he probably only would make it all the worse. As for now? He's sitting with his back to the base of the figurehead of the ship, arms folded behind his head.



Fortunately, Nami doesnt' even remember the adventure she and her sister had, that ended with a cow winding up on the ship. She's also been out almost all day, if the returning navigator bounding up the ramp on almost all fours is any indication. Where she's been? WHo can say - and she's not telling. In fact, Nojiko and Nami are often gone and back at the same time. Probably they were shopping, or studying the fish in the Water Garden, Or something.
 
Regardless! Nami is back now, and she stops just long enough to stretch, arching her back in doing so. ""Mfh!"" Aah, what a good day! GOod hunting too! Luffy's presence on the ship catches her attention, and she ponders for a second, before wandering in his general direction. She'll acknowledge him when she's good and ready. So it's about twenty minutes before she comes in speaking range, kneeling, ""N.. Hi Luffy!"" Give her a second to pick up on the catnip. Then beware. n.n



Come to think of it, Luffy's not really sure how long he's been sitting here.  Zoning out frequently has that sort of side-effect of a loss of time.  He's pretty sure it's still the same day, because if he'd really been sitting there all night and most of the next day, Knives would've dragged him into the storage room and let him zone out out of the elements, or someone else would've wondered what's up.  So... that's good!  (Because he didn't want to miss out if there was more steak for dinner.)

Typical Luffy.

Bounding up the ramp on all fours?  Almost?  Wow, Nami, people are going to think they're -really- weird.  And not just because of a few of the more obvious details!  Either that, or the numbers of Tangerine Sisters fanboys are going to increase dramatically. <_<;  Luffy at least doesn't gawk this time, he only blinks.

Twenty minutes later, once Luffy's figured she really IS going to ignore him, there she is again!  ""H--""  Blink.  ""Hi.  What are you doing?"" he asks with a grin.  What?  He can't help it. ._.;;  Besides, she reminds him strongly of how Shanks-cat acts when the kitten's trying to be particularly cute at someone.  Cute, but aloof.



Nonsense! Nami is nothing like that adorable kittycat. Really! She tilts her head a little, studying the sky at the question, ""Doing? Nnyothing."" Er. ""Nothing."" She meant Nothing. Errgh. She raises a hand and scritches behind her ear, -- pauses mid scritch to /stare/ at Luffy intently for a second. 
 
She /knows/ that smell. Not TemporaryExCaptain smell, but KittyDrug smell. She LIKES that smell. But where is it coming from? She shifts a little, fingers pressing into the deck as her eyes squint half shut for a second. Oh that smell IS terribly intoxicating. There's even a vague look on her face the more she scents for it, inching a little closer to the straw-hatted one, suspiciously. 
 
Yeah - the scent is /definitely/ on him somewhere..



Right.  That guy seemed to think carrying something a cat (he assumed anyway that a cat is what he meant) would like should take care of all the cat trouble!  So Luffy was carrying it around in the hopes that it would somehow be a cheap, quick cure for Nami's condition, and if it worked, he'd recommend it to Arlen!

See, if he'd only gone to Arlen EARLIER, he wouldn't be causeing more trouble inadvertantly.

But he's forgotten about what he has in his pocket, so at the moment, he's giving Nami a slightly wary, but mostly confused look when she starts to inch closer to him.  Is she--is she SNIFFING at him?  What the hell?!  ..Oh, heh.  That IS how he found out she got hurt after all. c_c;  Guess this is how she felt, huh.

On the other hand, he needn't find this so privately amusing. <_<;;;  ""What?  What is it?""



Well - not /COMPLETELY/ how she felt. :D She was more unnerved when he sniffed her, whereas Luffy is amused. ""Mmmmmrrr.."" She answers in response to his question. ""I smell something.."" She leans closer for a better sniff, the vaguely unfocused look on her eyes giving her a rather.. drunk expression. ""/Good/."" Meat! 
 
No.. not meat. Sorry Luffy. Ah - you'll also have to forgive her if it's her turn to invade personal space, a sudden rattling purr voiced as she sways slightly. Ooh -I waaaaaaant! Where is it! Hand it over! And if that's not surprising enough, perhaps it is when she closes the space to rub her cheek against Luffy's shoulder, breathing in the assorted mix of scents there. Catnip. Where is it where is it! *.* ..
 
... yeah. she's gone. ^*.*^



Oh, right.  Well, Nami has plenty of reasons to be suspicious of people and plenty more reasons to be a believer in the sanctity of her personal space, whereas Luffy is probably more trusting than he should be--but then, he wouldn't be Luffy if he wasn't that way.  In this case, Luffy's probably not alone when he thinks her behavior isn't unpleasantly unnerving.  In fact, he probably has a lot of people agreeing with him when he thinks it's an interesting reaction. <_<;

(But coming from a guy who exclaims that ugly bugs are interesting, that isn't saying much.)

Something smells good?  It's Luffy's first instinct to glance up towards the common room door, looking for the telltale smells of cooking or at least a plume of steam from an open door or something, but then she's -cheekrubbing- his shoulder?!

Cue a quiet series of startled blinks.  And THEN a glance at her.  ""Um.  Nami?  You okay?""  You're being unusually affectionate, and for you, that's like GROWING THREE HEADS and singing the National Anthem. o_o;;  Not that he's complaining, mind!



It /is/ unusual, and when she regains her senses, she will DENY IT TILL HER FACE TURNS BLUE. Some habits are hard to break, even around the people she cares for. It's why she had a dagger under her pillow every night. Is she okay? Why she's MORE than okay! She's high on catnip! Though from the wavering, muffled giggle to his question - well she must be okay right? She doesn't look in pain, even if her expression is /odd/ to say the least. Or maybe that's because she's /grinning/ so widely.
 
Pacing back and forth across Luffy's legs, she presses her side against him in an affectionate rubbing gesture, her tail flicking across his face in the same gesture. Teeckle teekle! But it's on the final pass that she actually leans up to lick his cheek, and then curl up across his lap again, close to the HappyGoodCatnipSmell! Purring loudly, fingers kneading away. ^~.~^



Oh god.  Nami... seems... kind of -- is she DRUNK?  Luffy inhales through his nose and doesn't -smell- any alcohol (goodness knows he's seen Zoro drink, and dragged a drunken Edward back to his house enough times to know what it smells like--not to mention been drunk himself. <_<;;).  Then... why on earth is she acting so strange?!  And Nami wouldn't be Nami if she didn't stalwartly deny any such display of public affection--or say she was trying to pick his wallet, except he isn't -carrying- one.

Just, um.  A few coins and some sprigs of catnip.  *keff*

And what the -hell-?  Why is she pacing back and forth like th--When her tail brushes past his nose, he turns his head sharply away to stifle the urge to sneeze (that TICKLES!!@_@) and straightens up his head to ask what on -earth- she's doing... only to promptly forget what it was he was about to ask.

Instead, he'll just blink a few more times, bewildered.

At least three times, he attempts to open his mouth to speak.  Third time's the charm, or not--he only grabs his hat and shoves it down over his face, blushing.  ""Na--nandayo, Nami.""  What are you DOING?!



Completely oblivious to poor Luffy's predicament, Nami doesn't even /answer/ his flustered reaction. What? Don't move around so much! She tucks herself up against the poor Captain, one ear twitching back in his direction, then swiveling forward. And apparently! She's going to make herself right at home, as she hiccups slightly and nuzzles her cheek against Luffy, resting her head on her hands. The purring pauses only long enough for her to get settled, where it picks up again. I'm sorry Luffy, are you a little embarassed? Well Nami would be too - if she were any bit aware of what she were doing. And if there's a warbled little giggle in between purrs - well -- just ignore that. @.x Even though she doesn't -smell- like she swam in booze, she sure is pretty close to acting it. She just isn't singing Hey Jude.



You know, when he works out why he's flustered beyond 'stop it you're embarassing me', you'll be--...

... the LAST to know. <_<;;

Luffy sits there, feeling and looking terribly helpless as to what on earth he does with a /CATGIRL/ curled up on his LAP. ._.;  Here he is, the future Pirate King, and probably, at this VERY MOMENT, the envy of thousands of other guys on this world or their own, and he hasn't the foggiest idea of what he should do about it.

There are probably several hundred people who want to SMACK HIM for being so stupid; the writer is one of them.

But--look.  Ears.  Cat ears.  So, a furtive glance shot one way and then the other under the brim of his straw hat, and he gingerly starts scritching beneath one.  Aww, she's so cute. ._.;;  If he had yarn, he'd dangle it, but this is a BIG CAT compared to Shanks-kitty, and...well, he doesn't want to lose a finger. <_<;



She doesn't have to know at all! Really! But for the most part, Nami is STILL quite unaware of her own behavior, or how discomfited Luffy appeared to be. If there was yarn? Yeah - she might accidentally bite, or scratch him in an attempt to get at the toy. Mustn't get hurt accidentally,right? Only occasionally rubbing against Luffy's side from her position, her ear twitches once at the scritching. There's a muffled, pleased little, 'Myaa~!"" from Nami as she leans into the scritching, her eyes half closed as she purrrrrs for all she's worth. Catnip and Scritching. Life doesn't get much better than this!



Good!  Because at the rate Luffy's always going, mentally?  His chances of ever figuring it out enough to be able to coherantly explain it to anyone else are pretty much those of a snowball in the caldera of the Moon Mount outside Promethea.  On the other hand, what had been a lot of awkward blushing is gradually turning into pleased amusement.  But then, that'd be because she just made the most UN-NAMILIKE and incidentally very adorable noise EVER. <_<;;  Dammit, Nami!  You're not discouraging him!  He's never going to go without a sprig of catnip around again--until he forgets, of course.  ""...How did you get like this, anyway?  Is it really a curse?""  Well, he's mostly thinking (stop laughing) aloud, but it's a good question to ask.



Of /COURSE/ it's a curse! How can you even doubt? As for how she got like this -- she'd like to tell you, she really would, but every time she figures something out - she forgets; or Nojiko forgets. It's sort of like having something on the tip of your tongue. She stretches her arms out just enough to rub her shoulder and head against Luffy. I didn't say you could stop scritching! And curls up again. She would be HORRIFIED and MORTIFIED if she knew she was acting like this.



Aha. So it's like the cat -- or Yoruichi -- really DOES have your tongue, at least in that matter, hm? But--hey! He was trying to talk about something important and possibly lead to being HELPFUL and then you had to go and do THAT and well there goes his train of thought. *._.* Damn it, Nami! ...Okay, fine, the scritches shall continue until morale improves, or at least until Luffy stops fighting with the urge to blush. -_-;;; Though another thought (so many today, must be a new record) occurs to the pirate. ""...Na, Nami.""



When you put it that way, yes, it's very much like that. And Nami's sorry! She didn't know you were trying to be helpful! She's just comfortable over here. m^n.n^m At least she's stopped clawing at your leg, right? ""Mrrt?"" Is an inquisitive noise that Nami makes at the sound of her name, and one ear turns in Luffy's direction. She doesn't feel like lifting her head. So what's on your mind, chum?



""Nnh.""  Hesitation's there for a good reason, when it's rare in someone so quick to make decisions.  She seems so... uh.  Well, so relaxed and /happy/ and blissfully unaware, and yet he still hasn't addressed what had happened.  And has the sneaking suspicion that Nami doesn't -remember-.  ""...About everything that happened before,"" mutters Luffy, though the scritching at this point has become an automatic ritual of the fingers, ""....I don't remember much,"" which is a lie he doesn't like saying, but he's pretty certain it'd be easier on everyone if he claimed ignorance, and the happiness of his nakama is foremost on the list of importance.  ""But I'm sorry.""



The purring quiets a good deal as Luffy begins speaking. Remember? She isn't sure -what- she remembered. THere were snippets that seemed like a horrible memory, snippets that seemed like a maddeningly odd dream - she wasn't sure whether it was /real/ or not. Her eyes have since blinked shut, though she's quite aware of what he's saying. Whether she -understands- him in this state, is debatable. There is silence that follows his apology though, which could mean any number of things. She could have fallen asleep - her eyes /are/ shut after all. She could be thinking over his words - if she understood him. Or..she was completely snubbing him! As cats were wont to do every now and again. It's not very different from how she would behave otherwise - only there she would dismiss it quicky or change the subject.



Sorry to be a killjoy, but it's one of the first times Luffy's been able to talk with Nami privately and hasn't been falling over every few minutes. The periods between those moments are getting longer, at the cost of said moments being harder to shake off. He'll figure out how to take care of it--what was it Edward had said he needed to do? ...Eh, he'll ask Arlen what it was. It was complicated and more than he understood, but Arlen was eavesdropping in his head, he thinks. That silence is a little unnerving, though. Even one of her quick changes of subject or the dismissal, even if she railed at him about it would be almost better than all that silence. "".....Nh."" A hand comes up to scrub at his nose, frowning. ""I don't even know if you understand what I mean. I don't even understand what I mean."" A pause. ""But I know what was making me do that stuff is gone, now. Arlen sent it flying, this time.""



Well that's a relief to know! Though her ears pin back briefly at that .. rather confusing comment. He didn't understand if she understood what he meant, when he didn't understand what he meant? What? o.O; That made her head hurt. >.< If the silence is unnerving, perhaps the sudden, low growl is a bit moreso. But there's a reason for that!
 
""RrrrrrwwwllllllUFffy,"" is given in a slow hiss. ""What. Are you. DOING?"" Why he's SCRITCHING you behind the ears Nami! Silly girl! You were enjoying it, admit it! ... okay don't admit it. It'll never be admitted to! ..hey wait, what's she getting mad at YOU for? She's the one that curled up in Luffy's lap! Tsh. Crazy Nami.



She's growling at him! Was it something he said? His own words had confused him, but in his confusion did he accidentally insult her? His hand promptly leaves her head and joins the other in the air as if he were under arrest and trying to prove he was unarmed, eyes a little wide while he attempts to remember (and failing) if he'd said anything offensive.

""You--"" Realizing that there's no way to describe what she'd been doing without succumbing to this inexplicably and totally annoying need to blush with embarassment, he only grabs his hat and pulls it down over his eyes with a grimace. ""Um-nothing."" That's practically one word there. ""Sorry."" DON'T KILL HIM. C_C;



KILL!! KIIIIIIIIILLL! Even though Nami herself was having quite the urge to crawl into some small, dark place and HIDE. And for a second, she almost regrets having said anything. The earscritching did feel..really good. But Er.. NO! That was just the CAT thinking that. Last thing she remembered was .. kneeling to say 'hi'. And then she smelled something really good -- She quickly straightens, pushing herself off of Luffy's lap and backing away several paces, putting her back to him for a little composure grooming. ^>.<^ ""Well..! .. .. You SHOULD be! The hell were you thinking!!"" When in doubt, blame someone else! o.o;;; ...god, what was /SHE/ thinking, climbing into his lap like that? BAD Luffy! He must have LURED her over there and .. .. .. yeah /right/.



Sure, lured. <_<; Luffy can take that blame. He did, after all, carry around catnip. ._.; Well, at least she's acting normal again! Kinda. Okay, still rather feline, like a cat who is trying to recover some injured pride, but Luffy thinks this is a little closer to normal than before! ....On the other hand, he's regretting bringing it up when it resulted in a loss of one (1) purring--SHUT UP. C_C; ""I was just apologizing to you! Why do you have to get angry at me?"" protests Luffy, though not because he's upset at her, but mostly because he's kind of upset at himself. ._.;;



HmpH! HMPH! And.. uh.. HMPH! again! ""I can't believe you even have to /ask/!"" Yeah! Because uh.. the ..incident was..so TERRIBLE she's FURIOUS with him for giving her...earscritchies that felt REALLY really good *.*;;;
Um. No! No sir! Quick! Move on to another subject, ""..besides! what's the point of apologizing?"" It's over and done with! it Hadn't been him .. which she is VEEEEERY grateful for. If it had been him.. REALLY him she.. isn't sure WHAT she'd have thought. She might have walked with Nojiko.




""Of course I have to ask! You're so CONFUSING!"" retorts the temporarily ex-Captain, throwing up his arms in frustration. AUGH. NAMI! You're impossible! SO INFURIATING! Here he was trying to be serious and apologize and you're getting angry at him and he doesn't know why! ....Oh, well. The scritching may have had something to do with it. <_<;;

What's the point of apologizing?

Luffy crosses his arms and glances...elsewhere. ""Because you're still sleeping with a knife under your pillow.""



May have? Well.. t'was her own fault for getting all cuddly and affectionate. Stupid catnip. Are you sure you want to risk keeping that stuff in your pockets now? :D She pauses only for a second at the frustrated gesture, looking over her shoulder, and then glances away again. She's all set to STORM off in a huff when that last comment is made - which has her stop dead. Uh... oh. He saw that did he? ... wait. When did he see that?
 
She bites her lower lip for a second. When, when, wh- OH! Now she remembers. It must have been a few nights ago when he kept falling over in her room. Right. Okay then. She won't give him the satisfaction of her acknowledgement though, so she turns to the railing. The only indication of her mood in fact, would be in the stillness of her tail, save for the aggravated twitchtwittching of its tip. 
 
Why do you have to be so damned INTUITIVE! ""S..so what?"" She's had that dagger since she got on the Going Merry. She's grateful she never had to -use- it, but.. (( Droplets of blood, a malicious smirk )) She shakes her head quickly. Stupid dreams. Just dreams. That's all.



Don't blame the catnip like people say 'Oh, I was drunk, I couldn't really help myself'! ...Except cats and humans alike do some pretty stupid/funny/cute things when they're under the influence of such things as alcohol and catnip. That's no excuse to abuse either! .....Though hopefully she won't mind if Luffy continues to carry around catnip. <_<;; You know. For luck. Really. *Keff*

Luffy remains seated there, looking off elsewhere with much the same stoic aggravation that has Nami staring over a rail with her tail twitching. EYes half-lidded, arms crossed. "".....""

So what. "".........."" Luffy glances over a shoulder, frowning, and then he bows his head with a silent sigh, expression vanishing in favor of just mild frustration. He gets to his feet, pulling off a hat that still had cat fur stuck in the crown. He hadn't bothered to pluck them out yet.

And sits right on the railing, so he can face her, turning the hat over and over in his hands. ""It isn't a big deal."" He glances at her. ""That's what you'd say, right? But I think it's important.""




The tail lashes once, as Luffy claims the spot in front of her on the railing. Both ears flat against her head, she looks tempted to walk away. She could dismiss this, just like everything else. She spares only a brief glance for the hat with the cat fur - ahaha, she.. uh. Hrm. He should probably pull that cat fur out sooner or later. ""That's no surprise,"" Nami laughs shortly, "".. you think everything is important."" It's really admirable. Not that she'll say as much. Her tail swings back and forth again, another irritated lash as she glances at the tempory former Captain. What, did he want her to say she'd toss the dagger? Sorry, she can't do that. What if something happened? Not necessarily the same thing, but..




See this railing? His now! Especially if it means he can occupy it and not get shut out visually, because he's -also- somewhat sure Nami would try to look out at the ocean or the docks instead, and probably try to dismiss this. Even worse, she might resort to one of those smiles, and those, especially if he suspects the truth, kind of sting in a way he can't quite describe. All he knows is--he doesn't like it.

(( You think everything is important. )) Luffy nods once. ""Aa. I do."" And that doesn't have a note of challenge in it, it's just the statement of a fact. He swings a foot a little, idly. ""...I know, I keep bothering you,"" he says after a long silence. He's always sitting outside that shut door, isn't he? ""I can't really help it,"" he adds, rubbing a hand along the back of his neck. ""I guess what I mean is,"" he shoves his hat back on, ""Um, can you trust me like you did before?""



It's one of her best defenses. WHen she can't dismiss it entirely, she smiles. But Luffy is right in thinking that Nami would study the docks or the ocean; in fact, there's a momentarily annoyed look on her face with her view of them obstructed by Luffy. You're blocking her VIEW! At least she hasn't started smiling yet. But she still seems determined to not look directly at Luffy, her gaze slanting to the side. Yes, he DOES bother her. It's like a favorite past time of his. 
 
It's telling how much he trusts her, that he would sit there. If she really hated him, all she need do is step forward and push. Knock him off the railing, into the water. But really, she doesn't hate him. And it's not that she -didn't- trust him, but...
 
(( ""Um, can you trust me like you did before?"" ))
 
""What are you talking about, Luffy?""
 
Nami pulls her gaze back to her friend.
 
""I trust you."" 
 
She smiles.
 
And then turns around and walks towards the girls quarters, lifting a hand, ""Oyasumi ne?""



Luffy would've preferred it if there wasn't that glance back with that smile, because he isn't able to keep himself from wearing the stunned sort of muted surprise that can be seen briefly on the faces of uncomprehending hostages who have for the first time faced the barrel of a gun. Not quite, but he does feel like he's been shot just the same.

""....""

""A--"" He shuts his mouth, and with a blink neutralizes his expression with a small nod. "".......Mm."" he says shortly, not out of trying to sound curt, but just because he's a little lacking in breath. ""Wakatta."" Understood.

So that's where things stand. Or where he does, by the railing. ""Oyasumi."""

"event","After Luffy has his talk with Edward, he spots Winry on his way back.

<lj-cut text=""I don't work with Equivalent Trade."">

IT'S PACKED! HURRAH! HURRAY!! ...Granted, she's only thinking about the surgical equipment, the heart-lung machine, her tools and automail still have to be packed, but OMG! ONE BIG PROJECT OUT OF THE WAY! It's enough to bring Winry partly out of the funk she's been in the past few days, more quiet and withdrawn than usual. A part of her wanders if anyone's noticed. A bigger part wonders if it really matters, since no one's spoken up yet. And that last little part of her is what is thinking of getting back home, keeping a smile on her face as she walks through the hospital grounds. She's got to find Ed again, now that she's finished with most of her packing, to give the port it's daily treatment and listen to his daily whining. And, in a remarkable side effect she hadn't even been expecting, not responding with her daily snark tends to get rid of /quite a bit/ of his whining. She'll have to keep that in mind.

For now, the blonde mechanic, coveralls and tube top traded for skirt and blouse, makes her way through the grounds. The nurses had told her Ed was outside-- which was why she immediately checked his hospital room. One of these days, the nurses are going to get /really/ irritated with Winry's distrust of them and call her on it. And that will be the day Winry goes postal with all the arguments Ed's been convincing her not to scream. But today, she's happy enough, finally heading outside after checking and making sure that-- yup-- his room was empty!



That went well.  Sort of.  Luffy made it through all that with only one blanking-out spell this time!  Except another had him spending the next few minutes standing in the path that leads through the hospital grounds, staring off into space.  No one bothered him; after all, lots of people get lost in thought now and then.  But when he can move again, that's when he notices (and recognizes) the blonde headed out of the hospital.

His first thought is voiced.  ""Winry!""  and a wave of a hand thrown into the air.  His second thought comes later, much later.  Like, how she might be kind of FIGHTING MAD at him right now.  Fortunately, he's too stupid (or too secure in his rubbery status) to find someplace to hide from retribution.  He only walks her way.

""....""  Oh great.  Here's the awkward part.  The pirate lifts a hand to scratch at the scar under one eye, scuffing at the path with a sandalled foot.  ""Um, hey, about Edward...""



Slight smile of semi-happiness? Gone. Frown of perpetual anger and possible wrenching? Check. As the smile bleeds to frown when Winry catches sight of the pirate, she does indeed drop a hand to her waistline-- and miraculously lift a wrench from no where. And when Luffy starts to talk about Edward? Oh no...

Stalking up the path to meet him, Winry stops close to him-- not enough to touch, but certainly enough to chuck a wrench at. She looks, for a moment, like she might do just that without a word. But after a moment and an exhale that's more huffing than a sigh, she crosses her arms over her chest, wrench clutched firmly in one hand. ""What /about/ him?"" she asks, quiet and near-trembling with restraint. Well, she didn't hit him - she must be /trying/ to understand! ...Right?



....Uh oh.  Luffy's hand lowers from his face, his expression neutral.  Which isn't all that unexpected; one of his most common expressions is this one, when he's not grinning.  Unfortunately, until he gets the rest of his missing soul back, this one will probably be the most prevalent.  ""You can hit me with that, if you really need to,"" Luffy warns, nodding towards where her hand holds a wrench, ""But it won't hurt me much.""  No, not even Winry's amazing wrench-fu will hurt a rubber pirate as much as might satisfy her justified fury.

""He's one of my best friends outside of nakama,"" explains the straw hatted pirate soberly, ""I don't know if he told you or not, but there was...""  He squints a moment, concentrating.  ""Something.""  That's not helpful.  ""What's the word when a ghost takes over someone and makes them do things?  Posse?  Positron?""  Where did he hear THAT one?  ""Uhh...""

Oh!  ""Possessed!""  Ladies and gents, he remembered it!  ""But that still doesn't excuse what these hands did.""  Off goes the straw hat, and he bows his head.  ""I'm sorry.  I tried to stop it, so I'm glad he's alive.""



It was partly Edward, who told her that Luffy hadn't meant to, that he was sick. But it was indeed mostly Chopper who convinced Winry not to go on a murderous rampage. After all, the little doctor was Luffy's friend-- and he'd given Winry more help than she could have imagined during the surgery. It's enough that, even when Luffy offers, she doesn't hit him.

But /god/ she wants to.

When he's finished speaking, head bowed and hat down, even apologizing, Winry knows that a better person would forgive him and move on. Maybe even hug him. But she also knows that... she's not /that/ good of a person. So she speaks softly, the anger growing in expression and tone as words flow. ""...You bent his port. It's made of automail and you forced a dent into it that cut into him - skin and muscle. And you... you ripped out the wires in the port. They connect directly to his nerves and you-- you /tore them out/."" The knuckles of her fingers are white, gripping arm and wrench where she crosses them, her eyes on Luffy's bowed head. ""So I had to do surgery. I had to pull the broken port off and clean off the flesh underneath-- it had an infection because this hospital is too underdeveloped to have the supplies to give him the care he needs. And then I had to put a new port on, and a new interface and new wires and you have to insert the wires into the nerves and then send an electrical current through them to make sure that they work and I knew because every time I did he /screamed/...""

Her eyes close, trailing off as she turns her head to the side, hiding the tears that track down her cheeks. ""...He had to be on painkillers so every time he woke up while I was working on him, he was high and he had a fever so he was delusional and he--"" here's the hard part, the proof that she's /really/ upset, ""and he /proposed/ and now he doesn't even remember and I-- I don't anyone to talk to but the goddamn idiot that did this to him!"" And then? /Then/ she'll hit Luffy, the wrench swinging out to catch him in the arm before she simply bows her head and stifles sobs.



At first, when Luffy had come back from the confrontation with Knives that had ended in the retreat of the Darkened influence that started this whole mess, he had been pretty incoherant.  It's worked itself out more and more as he's started to adjust to running on spiritual vapors in a proverbial gas tank.  Granted, this is largely due to the patience of his nakama, and the psionic bolstering by Knives.  He ... didn't have to.  He really didn't.  But he answered the question of 'why' already.  Because you are my friend.  And that's a sentiment more powerful to someone like Luffy than the strongest punch.

Ever since he fell from the sky into the lake outside Middleton, he has met so many amazing people, seen so many wonderful things, and made friends the memory of which he'll treasure as long as he can.

Winry speaks, and Luffy lifts his head, watching her without comment, without anything but the same receptive, attentive neutrality that had one man asking him if he only enjoyed playing dumb.  He's just simple; something like this requires his full attention, so he'll give it.  He doesn't understand medicine or automail or engineering, but he doesn't have to--there is EVERYTHING ELSE about her demeanor, her tone, that tells him what he needs to know.

She's had a very hard time.

He doesn't move until the wrench has connected with his arm, and then his hand moves to take her hand by the wrist, if only to gently prevent her from trying to swing again.  Looking up, past her, he tugs her into a tight hug, frowning.  Why say anything?  It'd only draw attention to the fact she's crying, so he'll only pretend he just happens to be here, oblivious.



He just happens to be there, tugging her into a hug. That's all. And Winry, not expect this at all, raises both arms as if to defend herself, even if her wrist isn't disloged from his grip in the process. But once she realizes what he's doing, offering comfort, not to shut her up but to let her just /have/ it...

Winry's good with that whole mood-swing thing, sharp anger turning to sobbing mess within a moment. She actually /drops the wrench on the ground/ - an amazing feat, all in itself - to fist hands in his shirt, bow her head and cry. Edward can't stand it when she cries, flails and freaks out to make her stop and Alphonse isn't much better; Kurogane would probably just kill the nearest thing with his sword, assuming that was what was bothering her; Velvet would try to kiss and make it better; Nina and Nate aren't /allowed/ to see her weakness.

So Luffy, and what he offers now... they're rare gifts. And when she's finished, sobs toning down to soft sniffles she would never admit were sounds she made, Winry releases him, trying to step back as she rubs at her eyes. ""...I got your shirt all wet,"" is all she says in a thick mumble as she studiously avoids his eyes.



Luffy's the kind of guy who would up and SMACK someone who tried to shut someone up when they're speaking from the heart.  Just like he's the kind of person who wouldn't tell a friend to 'stay where they were' in a dangerous situation when he knows he wouldn't listen to such advice.  Unless, of course, he was instructed to say such a thing--like in Winry's case, last time they spoke--but in those cases he'll at least try to incite them to action anyway, either by the method of delivery (( We're pirates, we don't save people. )) or assumed demeanor.

He isn't the kind of person who can deal well with complicated things, but what he IS.. is a pirate who respects the voice truest to one's feelings, one who doesn't hold back his feelings.  He's simple enough that he understands that sometimes people just need to cry, that things can't be fixed immediately or easily, and that everyone needs a moment to act and speak and get upset or be happy and just BE THAT and nothing else.

He's still looking up past her at the hospital when she speaks again, and then belatedly looks down at his vest.  ""I'll just tell everyone I went swimming.""  The irony might be lost on her, but the truth is, those who have eaten a Devil Fruit - the source of his strange power - sink like a rock in the water forever more.

""...He proposed?  You mean like, marriage?""



Irony: totally lost. Kindness: not. Winry's the sort of person who will do anything to put a smile on someone's face, delighting in her ability to do it-- even if it happens /after/ she put the frown there in the first place. To have the sentiment returned to her... it's nice. Unusual, but certainly not unwelcome and she laughs softly as she crouches to pick up her wrench, still rubbing at her eyes. ""And only got your chest wet? How does that work?"" The irony would be double if she knew-- she'd immediately ask what kind of idiot becomes a pirate when he can't swim!

And... oh. Did she say that? She blinks at him for a minute, poleaxed before proving how good she is at that mood-swing thing again. Making a panicked sound that has no writable equal, Winry reaches forward to grab his vest, eyes wide and imploring. ""Don't tell him! He doesn't remember and he'd be really embarassed and he isn't really going to do it and OH PLEASE DON'T TELL HIM!"" Things were uneasy enough with her and Edward, she didn't need people telling him about his proposal or intense disappointment when he'd thought she was refusing him!



Only the kind of pirate who will overcome even the threat of certain drowning to chase after his dreams!  The Grand Line consumes all who dare sail its waters leaving behind only the strongest and most resilient (or lucky) back on there world; for this reason, you'll run into more and more of those cursed and blessed with the Devil Fruit around there.  But that's nowhere near here, so knowledge of them is pretty hard to come by.  Fortunately (or unfortunately), Luffy is rather vocal about it, much to some people's dismay.  Someone needs to tell Luffy to stop telling everyone what their greatest weakness is.

""Uh...""  Only got his chest wet?  Luffy looks down again, scratching his head.  ""It was a really small pool.""  He grins then, shoving his hat onto his head.  Yes, he knows he's being silly.  In other words, Winry, it's okay.

Though his eyes go wide when she grabs him by the vest.  ""...I...""  He shakes his head, ""I won't.  But you know, he probably will ask you.""  A small nod.  Luffy seems so... /sure/ of himself.  ""So... I'd start thinking about what I'd say,"" he adds, laughing a little.  True though, isn't it?  ""Whatever your answer is.""

""........"" Luffy suddenly grabs at his hat with both hands, eyes wide with a distressed tone. ""OH GOD. WHY AM I GIVING YOU ADVICE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AUGH.""



Wha-- he /is/ going to ask?! That only gets him a tighter grip on his vest! ""He will?! How do you know?! Did he say so?!"" This is Winry. You've seen her calm, pleasant, angry, and sad. But you've never seen her AT THE HEIGHT OF INSANITY before, eyes wide and demanding, even shaking him a little. ""When?! And wh--""

And then /Luffy/ freaks out, and that doesn't help Winry at /all/, shaking him all the harder. ""DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW! THIS IS /IMPORTANT/, DAMN YOU!"" You know, eventually, Ed's going to come and see what all the fuss is about, and there will be /bigger/ problems then.



HEY.  Don't shake him!  Don't you see all the bandages, woman?!  ...Not that... being bandaged all over ever stopped Luffy from running around being reckless anyway.  Probably because most of the time he isn't even aware he might be aggravating his own injuries, which makes him a very lousy patient for poor Chopper.

To say Luffy tolerates this without reaction is a bit of an understatement.  He seems to have zoned out for a moment, until he blinks at her.  ""Instinct.""  What?  ""I think will.""  Luffy shrugs then, helpless.  ""I don't know about these things.  I don't know about cooking, or sword fighting, or how to read a map.  I don't even know how to set a bone unless someone shows me how.""

""But I think if he did it once, he'll probably do it again.  When he's like that, he's not really holding back, right?""  Luffy rubs at the back of his neck, looking to one side with a frown.  Man, he can't even get his OWN feelings straightened out, and here he's trying to help out Winry?!  Instinct, it's all he's got to go on, so...

""Edward's kind of the sort of person who holds back sometimes.  It's probably the same thing here.  But I don't know.  That's just what instinct says.""



Bandages? BANDAGES?! SHE CARES NOT FOR YOUR BANDAGES! But Winry does, at least, release him and step back, dropping her hands to her sides and shaking her head. Luffy isn't /wrong/-- he's painfully right, actually. But pretending that he didn't really want to say it made it easier on Winry, made one less Very Important Decision (tm) not hers to figure out. And now Luffy's given it back to her. She makes a small noise of utter frustration that would be cute if she wasn't-- well, all frustrated. ""Yeah, but--"" But what? Edward holds back because he's an idiot and thinks problems will go away if he ignores them. He's probably waiting for one of his ""Right Times"" that never actually comes. ...Which, really, heartening! because it means she doesn't have to come to a decision, but...

What if he /does/ ask? Soon? What if she /does/ have to make a decision? ...What if she has to figure out why the fact that she's already playing Mommy to his kids, dating and living in the same house with him, been family all their lives... why making it /official/ is so scary?

There's nothing else to add to her 'yeah, but.' She's kind of dumb. And looking a bit like Luffy as she stares blankly at the ground. Girl just broke her brain a bit, is all.



""I thought getting married was a good thing?"" says a baffled pirate, lifting his hat off his head in order to ruffle the hair under it with a sincerely -confused- expression.  Well.  PIRATES don't go off and get married, usually, because the sea just takes them away again.  Besides, few people want to marry the 'lowest of the low'.  They'd sooner marry bandits or thieves!  But as Luffy remembers it in his home town, people would throw parties over weddings.

A moment spent adjusting his hat awkwardly, and Luffy frowns again.  ""Na.  Don't worry!""  Easy for him to say; he has no idea what it's like to be in her shoes.  ""Things will work out.  Definitely.""  Or at least, it has for him, so long as he kept moving forward.  But that method of living doesn't always work for other people, who don't think on such simple terms, who have to grapple with the more complicated things life has to offer.

""It might not work out now, or in five minutes, or five years, but things will work out.""




Luffy, if you weren't so simple, you'd be a genius. The phrasing used makes Winry's thought process go a little haywire. Five years was the time she'd spent in Rush Valley was Ed was on the other side of the Gate; Five years had gone by before they both appeared in the Dream (ignoring that 'other her' - she doesn't count); Winry was always yelling at Ed for hating the Dream because at least now they were together again; Things might not be perfect here, but they're all together, her and Ed and Al, they're all a family again.

It's not perfect... but they're together again.

""Anou..."" Winry says quietly, her eyes on the ground until they slowly work up. A smile finds its way onto her face-- amazing how she does it, no matter what the mood a smile can always finds its way to Winry-- and she nods. ""Yeah... yeah, you're right."" About marriage being a good thing? About everything working out? It doesn't look like Winry's going to say anything anytime soon about /that/, but she does look at Luffy and smile and not try to hit him with wrenches. ""...Thanks."" Strange to be thanking the man that put her boyfriend in traction, but she does it. ""...You won't tell, though, right?"" DON'T PLZ.



It's so funny how things can quickly turn around, huh?  Winry, Edward, Usopp.  They were so quick to forgive.  Nami just simply wasn't in her right state of mind--silly curse--and Zoro's anger was probably more fueled on confusion than anything else.  The others Luffy still needs to talk to.  But for now, this is something he can say worked out, at least on his end.  It's a relief.  These are good people, they're doing the best they can.

""Am I?""  Him, right about something?  Hold the Den Den Mushi!  Er... the phone.  Luffy looks sheepish, fussing with his straw hat with a small smile, shuffling a foot against the path.  ""Nah.  It's nothing.  I don't understand anything about this stuff at all.""  He really doesn't.  All he really has to go on is what instinct tells him. ._.  It hasn't failed him often!

""....Tell what?""  Luffy's expression is distressingly blank.  ""Sorry, I forgot already.  What?""  He is either the most stupid man in the world, or the world's best actor.  ""Oh yeah.  I have something for you.""

He rummages in his pocket - the one opposite the one that he'd produced a sextant for Edward, this time coming out with something on a long gold chain.  On the other end is what looks like a jeweled pendant, but as he hands it over, he says, ""Doesn't work.""  Oh, it's a compass.



He... doesn't remember? Winry blinks at him for a moment, clearly uncomprehending if he's serious or just messing with her... and unable to come up with an answer. Still, either way, it gets her what she wants - he won't tell Ed. So she shakes her head, about to tell him to forget about it-- when he changes the subject himself!

It's Winry's turn to look distressingly blank as he holds the compass out to her, though a moment later she /is/ reacting. A brow rises. ""...Why are you giving me this?"" Is this some kind of weird pirate ritual she doesn't know about? Will she have to be their slave forever for accepting the Sacred Broken Compass?



""When I sent Chopper to give you a hand with Edward,"" Luffy says, looking at the broken compass, ""He told me about how hard you worked to help him."" That compass could easily double as jewelry, or could be taken apart and fixed, but that's something Luffy doesn't know how to do without damaging it.  He lifts his head to look at her, offering it again, ""I bet work like that is expensive, so I want you to have this.""

He won't tell her it's from the ruins of a city that was wiped out overnight by Thunderbird.  That's just, well, in poor taste.  Not to mention kind of weird.  ""Besides!  It doesn't match anything I wear, and I can't eat it!""  See? PERFECTLY good reasons.



Turning blinking eyes from Luffy to the compass, Winry raises a hand-- to tuck a stray hair behind her ear. ""Well... I don't want it,"" she says softly, though firmly enough that no argument will be tolerated. Her chin rises, blue eyes seeking out his gaze. ""...Some things you can't fix with money and presents, Luffy-san. You have to do other things to earn forgiveness."" Reaching out again, this time she /does/ touch the compass-- to press it back into his palm. ""...You already gave me something and... to /me/, it was enough. I'm not Edward - I don't work with Equivalent Trade. But even if I did... you've already paid me."" Her hands around his, holding the compass safe in his palms, she looks up at him and smiles, beaming, perfect happiness-- /that's/ the Winry most always see and Luffy never has. ""So you keep it."" She giggles then and adds, ""Use it to trade for a really big meal, ne?""



Some things you can't fix with money.  Haha.  His navigator would be appalled, but he nods, comprehending.  Luffy tosses the compass in his hand once, letting the chain pool in his palm.  Some things you have to just work around.  Some things, like forgiveness, have to be earned through action.  These are all things he understands better than he lets on.  It hadn't been his intention; he's been without even a decent ship, let alone money for food, and knows hard work can be even harder without a little coin, even if he's the most irresponsible one on the ship with cash.

Equivalent Trade?  He still doesn't understand that.

But he ALSO knows that the way he thinks isn't always easily understood by others, just like how he doesn't understand more complex things that others grasp with ease.  He only pulls back his arm, and throws.

There is a crash in the upper window of the hospital.  ""Might wanna tell them that compass is there.  It'll pay for the broken window.  Ja na~"" singsongs Luffy innocently, already waving over his shoulder as he tries to make a quick getaway on foot.



Ah, he understands. That's good. Winry opens her mouth to say something else, but-- pauses when he pulls back. Eyes grow wide suddenly as she reaches up with a shout of, ""Oh, NO!"" But it's a wee bit late as the crash sounds and Winry puts her hands over head, grimacing. THIS is not good, Luff, thanks. And once he's gone, she's perfectly willing to turn and glare at him, shouting afterward, ""You didn't have to make such trouble! I'LL TAKE MY FORGIVENESS BACK!"" ...Can she do that? Maybe, but she doesn't look too sincere about it, turning with a roll of her eyes and wave of her hand as if to dismiss him, continuing on the way she'd been going before she ran into him."

<lj-cut text=""Anyone told you that you kick like an angry mule?"">


After practically throwing Winry /out/ to get cleaned up, get some food that wasn't hospital made, Edward rests quietly. He /was/ outside, watching the ocean, but they've moved him closer to the building now, in preperation to bring him inside to rest. He is still without arm, his torso bandaged beneath his pale shirt, and he is calm, collected, and at peace, seemingly, with a sketch pad across his lap and his left hand twiddling a pencil. 

He has seen better days. Sallowskined, shadow-eyed, and looking as if he has lost weight (for he assuredly has), he ... is a smaller and more weary alchemist, the one that cannot smile well or easily. Unable to move or manage his wheelchair alone, he fusses a little, before he glances over his shoulder quietly; the nurse has vanished. Good.

He flips the footrests up. One foot, then the other, find the grass. And then he takes his pad between his teenth an carefully, slowly pushes himself to his feet, and goes back to where he had been sitting in his wheelchair, beneath a large cypress, and slowly, slowly, eases himself to the grass, soon in a comfortable, slow sprawl.

The nurses can have a heart attack when they get back. For now, he wants to feel grass under one food and a tree against his back, and like less of a broken up invalid.



Somewhere, there's a Plant keeping psionic tabs on a straw hatted capt--

--Oh, sorry.  Not a captain.  He gave that position temporarily unto their marksman, Usopp, at least until he can hold five minutes' conversation without falling over, zoning out, or otherwise becoming completely unresponsive for a variable length of time.  As in, when he gets the rest of his soul back, because no captain can be seen doing those sorts of things!  Nor can a captain be trusted to do his job in that state!

But yes, that pirate, currently clad in the usual: denim, cut off at the knees; sandals; a red, sleeveless vest; a straw hat--and this time, bandages up arms, legs, and unseen under his shirt.  However, this doesn't seem to hinder him much at all while he meanders up towards the place of healing, a long stem of grass in his mouth.

The nurse is out of sight likely because she's directing a rather friendly youth who must certainly be a farmboy (dammit) towards where the Alchemist has made himself comfortable.  So there's a shadow falling over Edward before the wheelchair is nudged aside, and someone quite literally flops onto the ground nearby.

""Hey... this is a good spot,"" greets Luffy with a note of wonder.



Knives is ... lurking. Somewhere. And he's not coming out of lurkmode any time soon.



Pale eyes blink, before they turn to take in -- battered rubberpirate. Edward stares at him for a moment, and then smiles a little. ""Steaks short on supply, and what with my recent heart trouble, I should cut back on the red meat anyway."" Still, he smiles, and carefully, leaning against the tree, reaches across himself to pop the pirate in the shoulder, gently.

""Anyone told you that you kick like an angry mule?"" He asks, before he carefully gingerly, sits up a little. He smiles at Luffy, then, relief plain on his face. YOU'RE MOSTLY NORMAL. ""You-- You're okay, then? How are you? Did everything work out? Who got you set straight?"" He wants to know. Let him know who COVERED FOR HIS AMAZING FAILURE.



Cut back on red meat?  Travesty!  Them's fighting words, Edward!  At first, Luffy's started to put his straw hat over his eyes, just as if he meant to take a quick nap, but that makes him pause, lift his head a little and peer at the Alchemist beneath the brim of it in disbelief.  ""Baka ja nee no ka?""  You an idiot? is probably not a question that should be given from the simpleton pirate to an alchemist with a love of books.  ""Meat fixes everything.""

Eventually, he rolls over onto his stomach, pushing his hat up onto his head and resting on his elbows, ""...""  Reactions seem to be coming even slower than normal for the rubberman, like perhaps the reaction time in someone who was just woken out of very deep sleep.  ""Heart trouble?  Whose ass do I kick to fix it, huh?"" He says, aiming a punch at the air in front of him for a moment, smiling.

Speaking of kicks.  ""Nope.  Do I?  Guess I better, if I want to send someone flying.""  Recollection again takes longer than usual.  He winces, and hides his face under his hat.  ""Ohhh, /right/.  I'm so /sorry/."" AUGH.  Just the memory of it's enough to make HIM feel sympathy pains.

""....Mmhm.  Arlen kicked him out.""  Him who? ""But he says I have a spiritual concubine.""  .../what/?  ""You know, when you get hit really hard and you don't think straight.  Like that.""  Con/cussion/, you nitwit.  Not concubine.  ""So it makes me freeze up sometimes.  It's like sleeping while you're awake.""  A pause to think.  ""...Kinda.  You're alive.""  Even missing most of his soul (and thus, a lot of his enthusiasm and energy in general) can't leech genuine relief from his voice.



Who? ""Ahn,"" Edward says, ignoring commentary about the red meat and the haerts and the /stuff/; he doesn't want to explain his heart troubles, really -- once he got asked about those, it didn't take long for /him/ to figure out. He'll explain it later, really, Winry! When you're married. Which with his luck, will be never. 

But he laughs a little at Luffy's wince, and doles out more tales of masculine suffering. ""I have stitches, and a girlfriend. In a month, if things don't work right? You're in /so/ much trouble, rubber man."" 

Still, he's more concerned about this Arlen and the soul thing. ""You're -- conc-- oh! Concussed. Hmm. Well, come here."" He takes his pad, and then leans over, again, and begins to doodle on Luffy's arm. ""Don't move. This it'd work better on your head, but we'll deal with this, okay?"" He's gonna make a little array on your arm, Luffy! Isn't that special?



Luffy is so, so, SO glad he never has to worry about a swift kick to the nuts resulting in HORRIBLE THINGS like STITCHES or a GIRLF--wait, what?  Oh, okay, well, girls can be kind of scary.  (Case in point: ANY of the women on his ship when they're angry.  A furious Nami will send anyone on the ship running for their lives.)  BUT STITCHES.  Thank the gods for small favors like being RUBBERY. x_x;;

So, while he's gripping his hat over his eyes and kicking his feet behind him with a noise of distress at that bit of news, he only belatedly notices that his arm is being doodled on.  ""Nn?""  mutters Luffy, peeking over, but at least he doesn't move, even if his fingers twitch at a lack of being able to do anything else with that arm.  ""Will it wash out?""  He doesn't want to wear a funny drawing on his arm forever!

It's okay.  Hoatzin has been at His most calm in weeks, so Luffy has no reason to be disturbed.  And wow, he's doing such a good job keeping still!

....Oh, that'd probably be due to the fact that he has, for the moment, slipped into one of those 'gray' spaces.  On the outside, it looks like he's simply dozed off with eyes open, or perhaps entered some kind of motionless trance.  That isn't the case, as Edward may soon find out.  With only a fragment of soul in his body, there are frequent moments when he simply stops consciously reacting to the world around him.  He can still observe, but it's more or less 'Lights are on, and whoever's home is sort of catatonic for a few seconds to a few hours, depending.'.

Hey, it could be worse.  At least he's functioning, when according to some theories of missing souls and its effects, he should be stone cold dead.  He functions!  Just... in the way guttering candlelight does.  And this time, it's only brief.  He jerks his head up, blinking.  ""...What do you call it?""



""This is an alchemy array. Normally, I don't use them - -but without two hands, and with the delicate sort of work I'm doing... well. I need it right now."" He touches that mark he made, and thne says, a moment later, as it gloes blue, ""S'just ink; it'll wash right off."" 

He has created a small soul analyzation array. Not the best placement for it, but -- still. He gets enough information for him to know: Well, fuck. Good thing the rules of Luffy's world don't say 'hey man your body gets to start ROTTING NOW' without enough soul in there to be 'full'. He just-- frowns a little, and says, ""...looks like a good chunk of your spirit is gone, Luffy. You... might wanna get that back pronto.""

...is he even listaening? ""L--Luffy? Hey man, are you there?"" TAlk to him, Luffy?



Snapping out of it is a little like flipping a light switch--one that's self-activated, and completely random.  Needless to say, in the few days thus far dealt with, it's become a new and annoying source of frustration.  He really wanted to react when it glowed blue, but... hey, nothing doing.  He could be as amazed as he'd like, but still Luffy couldn't do jack nor shit about it.

He only blinks at Edward and shakes his head.  ""Just like that.  Spiritual con--con--""  Another long pause and he makes a frustrated noise.  ""Concentr--no.  Concrete!"" Oh gods, he's hopeless with new complicated words. -_-;  Or even traditional phrases like 'My condolances' that you're supposed to say at a grave site!  He messes those up with phrases like 'That was a great meal'.  Boy, was that one embarassing.

""...GONE?!""  Took him long enough.  ""How can it be gone?  It was there before!  I think.""



""Yes. Gone. Missing. Poof. Hole where stuff is supposed to be."" Edward then straightens, and takes up his notepad, propping it on his legs and begins to doodle. Again. ""...I would help you, but I'm sort of armless, sick, and due to get stitches taken out of sensitive places in a couple of days."" HE smiles thinly at that. Oh god. Scissors! THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE SCISSORS. DOWN /THERE/. Parts of him shrivel at the -very thought-.

""... so. Uhm. This Arlen? If he can help you? IT'd be a good idea to tell him parts of your soul are missing. It'll be detrmiental to your health."" Ed gives a curt nod, to punctate that sentance. Yup. Detrimental. Like saying 'good meal' at a graveside. ...Makes people wonder, Luffy. It really does.



The pirate seems to take this with no small amount of amazement.  How could it just be gone?  Did it get EATEN?!  Is that what the other thing was doing all that time?  The idea, however, that he might stay like this forever never really occurs to him; Luffy is more of a person who thinks of the now and here, and doesn't do a lot of planning or fretting about the future.  It'll work itself out.  Things always do.

""You did a lot.  That reminds me.""  He starts to search his pockets, which is a difficult thing to do when you're lying on your stomach.

Wait.  WHAT.  Scissors?  If you've never seen Luffy go pale, this is probably a rare chance.  Even if his reactions seem kind of late, and slow to move at that, he seems rather quietly mortified on the behalf of poor Edward.  ""I'm really sorry.""  He usually only saves kicks like that for people like, uh.  Buggy.  Heh. ._.;  Think of it this way!  At least you didn't get it TWICE, like he did. c_c;

""Arlen.  You know him.""  he says once he's recovered enough to search the pockets on the OTHER side, ""He used to be Knives, but then me and Hoatzin beat him up.  Now he's Arlen.""  See?  SIMPLE AS THAT.  Or not so simple.  THUNK.  What is it?  Some kind of flat sextant.  Solid gold.  Maybe useless here, since it was made for another world's sky and this world has a habit of being tricky, but it'd make a nice paperweight--or pay medical bills.  ""There.""



""NNGH?"" Excuse Edward as he just -- sort of stares at the OH MY GOD THING. Arlen? Knives?He just got swept away in the face of ZOMG WHAT THE HELL IS THAT LUFFY?

""Uh. What. Is that?"" It's -- uhm. Yeah. Pretty. And Shiny. And Gold. And Edward pokes it with his good hand and looks at it--it's. New and interesting and shiny. And supposedly for him. ""What's that for?"" he asks, then, tilting his head. Okay, Luffy, now t's Ed's turn to play stupid. He knwos very well what it's for, but he's about to argue you out of giving it to him.

Fear Edward Elric when he has brief spurts of nobililty. It's like chronic ecxema. Once he scratches that particular itch, it just comes back worse the next time.



What is it? ""Yours,"" Luffy replies, matter-of-factly. ""You gave me money when I couldn't refuse."" He was kind of unconscious at the time the package was delivered to the healers at Middleton. ""What, you think I'm letting you have that luxury?"" His hand falls onto the gold sextant, and shoves it purposefully towards the Alchemist.

""Take it. Paperweight. Or melt it down to pay for this,"" Luffy adds, tilting his head towards the hospital. He gets up, dusting off his--well, his bandages, and grins. ""I'll visit again, okay? I should tell Arlen what you told me."" Uh oh. Here comes a nurse. Time to run before he gets blamed for taking him off his wheelchair!"

"event","<lj-cut text=""A Marksman's Forgiveness! The Devil and A Temporary Captain?"">

The last thing that Usopp remembered from the previous day was being punched by Luffy. He was out all night but, despite Chopper's protests, got up this morning and started gathering his things. He didn't need to hear what Luffy said. He knew he was mutinying against the captain when he made that challenge, and there's only one thing a failed mutineer can do. 

Leave. 

So for a few hours in the morning, Usopp has been gathering all his things. Fortunately, they all did fit into his bag, unlike the first time he gathered everything to leave. He... really wasn't sure what he was going to do now, though. Maybe someone else in Bluefinger would need a handyman or a marksman for... something. But first he had something to do. Out by the docks, a ways down from where the Going Merry is anchored, Usopp sits beneath an overhang, writing a few letters. He has to say his full goodbyes, no matter how painful.



At some point that sleepless night spent in the storage room, Luffy stopped staring at nothing and went to the door.  Knives stopped him, told him to try to get some sleep.  He returned to the temporary bedding the Plant had set for him and sat until the sun rose, and only then got up again to step out onto the docks.

It was early, yet, and he was lucid enough to search the ship of slumbering nakama for Usopp, but not quite lucid enough to stop from giving the Plant a distressed stare and a nonsensical, unhappy mutter with a frustrated combing of fingers through disheveled hair.  He can't -express- what he needs to, and it's FRUSTRATING.  ""Usopp,"" he says to Knives, shaking his head.

Instead, he grabbed his arm and started down the gangplank to find him, and only let go when he finally spotted the marksman.

Hopefully, he's too engrossed in writing to notice there's a straw-hatted captain charging down the docks for him, intent on a flying-leap-tackle.



Tap tap tap. Dear Chopper. No, that sounds silly. Oi, Chopper! ...Not much better. Chopper. Yeah, that's good enough. Please take care of Merry-chan. I know I can trust you all to be a good family for her. Don't let her cry. Make sure she--

And that's when he hears the footsteps. ""O..oi! Chotto matte!"" Pencil is tossed aside and Usopp's hands come up to guard his face, but that's really not much protection from a flying captain. ThumptumbletumbletumbleWHAM! ""Iiii.... tatata."" What, did Luffy not beat him up enough? But that wasn't an attack. That was a greeting where Luffy was concerned. So... what's up with that?



Knives logically shouldn't be here, especially when Luffy's trying to apologize to his crewmates for the things the parasite had done. But he fully intended to remain in the area if anything happened, and Luffy's deciding to leave the ship and refusing to stay where he's PUT means that the Plant is forced to follow him. Wherever the captain goes, so does his temporary keeper.

Usopp and Luffy both have other things to worry about, namely eachother, than worrying about Knives, who simply stations himself just out of easy earshot, to lean against a wall and keep a weather eye out for trouble. Damn, but he's tired.



The Plant is the only deterrant they have against the Darkened spirit's return.  Not only that, but Knives is also the most well-informed, since he did all that mucking around in Luffy's head anyway, the only one who probably knows the whole story.  Considering how many of the crew (understandably) keeps him at a far distance, this is kind of ironic, in a funny sort of way.  And he's Luffy's friend, and he's also the person who just LIBERATED HIS SOUL, so pardon him if he drags Knives around all over the place!

Even though Usopp's protesting and in pain, the likewise bandaged (arms, legs, torso) captain only clings once he's got one nakama pinned down, letting go with one hand only to snatch his hat off his head and SHOVE it onto Usopp's face, making an unintelligible noise that sounds something like a threat not to reject it, and something like determination.  Eventually, though, he makes sense.

""Don't leave."" mumbles Luffy, his face down.  ""DON'T LEAVE.  I DIDN'T MEAN IT.""



In the middle of being tackled by an exhuberant rubberman, Usopp does notice the Plant's presence. What in the world is Knives doing here? He doesn't have much time to think about it though, as a familiar straw hat is dropped on his face. Ack, be careful! That nose is broken!

""...Luffy?"" It's a bit muffled from under the hat, but the confusion is evident. That makes even less sense. Reaching a hand up, Usopp pushes Luffy's arm and hat away so he can peer up at the captain. ""Didn't... mean..."" Okay, color him confused. Usopp glances for a moment at Knives, hoping for some kind of explanation. Hey, Knives is better than nothing!



Usopp gets one bonus point in Knives' view; he neither immediately attacks Knives or blames the Plant for everything that happened. Of course, since most humans start out in the negatives to begin with, this doesn't really amount to much past dry amusement. When he's looked to for answers, the alien gives a ghost of a smile and shrugs. It's been a long last 24 hours, but he's more coherent than Luffy is.

""Your captain,"" Knives says blandly, ""Was, as I'd said before though nobody listened to me, until very recently possessed."" He'll wait a moment to see how that explanation is handled before continuing. ""For an indeterminate amount of time he quite literally wasn't himself. Now he is, or what's left. Everything that creature did in his body, he watched. And wasn't able to do a damn thing to prevent."" He makes a light gesture with one gloved hand. ""He still feels responsible."" Did that explain everything?



What's left of him.  That one always gets the inevitable questions, and Luffy doesn't quite understand that part himself, but that's because he's not really sure what's wrong with him; he doesn't understand why he can't express himself the way he usually can, nor why he feels like a single marble rattling around inside an empty bottle sometimes.  But that's a complex thing, and complicated things tend to be ignored in favor of those simpler things much easier to comprehend.

Like how he'd done his most important people a great disservice, how he'd hurt them more than he can apologize for, but he'll do his best.  So all Luffy does for a moment is nod frantically at Knives' explanation, gratefully, hug Usopp as tight as he dares, and then belatedly sit up, nudging the hat over Usopp's eyes a little while he scrubs briefly at his face with a bandaged arm.

""My nakama.""  He says urgently.  ""So don't go.""



Ha! He knew it! Usopp knew it! Well, in a way. He knew Luffy wasn't himself and that something was wrong with the captain, but he didn't know just what it was! As Knives explains it, he nods several times, not quite as energetically as Luffy though. ""Ah... wel--erk! Oi, Luffy, not so tight!"" That's where he got punched!

The marksman pauses then, just looking up at Luffy as he makes his demands. ""Baka."" Reaching up, Usopp swats at the side of his head, then neatly replaces the straw hat. ""I..."" And now the tears come. We all know how Usopp can cry when he gets emotional, and those tears are just streaming down. ""You're really back. Of course I won't go."" Vision a bit blurry, he shifts his gaze back and forth between Luffy and Knives. While someone with more thought about them might ask things like 'where did the evil bit go,' Usopp doesn't care. No, though he still senses something wrong. ""Oi, Luffy..."" Sniffing slightly, he reaches up his own arm to wipe at his eyes. ""What's wrong with you? Are you really back?""



Luffy was .. mostly back. Knives did what he could, and didn't know what else /to/ do past make sure it doesn't happen again. Don't mind the jaw-cracking yawn, it's been a while since he slept. Usopp wasn't panicking yet, that was good. And he seemed more than willing to forgive his captain. He doesn't voice the thought that this Pinnochio fellow was perhaps better nakama for Luffy than that green-haired barbarian on the ship, but he thinks it, with a bitter sort of amusement. And jealousy. ""..."" What's wrong with Luffy? ""He's kind of got a severe concussion of the soul, Pinnochio."" He'd use the pirate's real name if he knew it! ""Ever get hit on the head really /really/ hard? Know how for a while it's hard to think straight or sometimes think at all?"" It's like that, but deeper. And more lasting. ""Just give him some time.""



The captain stares at Knives for a while during his explanation, not quite gawking at him but pretty damn close.  Wow!  You hear that?  A concubine of the soul!  Isn't that amaz--what, not concubine?  What's a concussion? o_o; (Or a concubine, for that matter.)  He scratches his head, looking down with an expression of deep concentration, and then he hears Usopp sniffling.  It makes him whip his head about to look at him, eyes wide.

Aw, /dammit/.  Hey, sometimes Luffy cries during funny moments when he's being outrageous, but this is sincere, and mostly due to the fact that he has an even harder time managing his emotions when he's running on spiritual fragments instead of a full tank.  Who gives a damn who sees a couple of pirates crying like their dog died, they can go jump in the drink for all he cares.  Losers!

""Sumanee, Usopp,"" apologizes Luffy, who puts a hand over his eyes with a grimace.  Dammit! Look what you made him do!  Stop that right now!  You suffered some of the worst of his behavior and yet you're the first to fully acknowledge what he did and the first to forgive.  Luffy drags the injured marksman into a hug that he attempts to make NOT quite as hard as he usually does, if only so he doesn't aggravate his injuries.  Just, uh, ignore the waterworks.  Mention this to no one!



Actually, Usopp has been hit on the head really really hard. With a four-ton bat. To the face. And he got right back up. It wasn't until a bit later that he collapsed from the fractured skull. And hey, there's nothing wrong with two men crying! It takes a manly man to cry, dangit!

The tears soon stop, though, as Usopp returns Luffy's hug. There there, he forgives you! It was the weird possessing thing, not Luffy! Knives' explanation does finally hit home, though, and Usopp waves a hand slightly. ""Oi. Usopp. U-So-Pu."" Not Pinocchio! ""...Did I hit him too hard with the Usopp Hammer yesterday?"" Gah. He -did- land a few blows on Luffy's head with that thing. ""AH! If I hit him again, will it go back to normal?"" He has his hammer with him! All he has to do is reach into his bag...



Aww, waterworks. Knives remains perfectly dry-eyed and vaguely aloof as the Pirates begin crying on eachother, absently pulling off gloves to examine his fingernails and cleaning them a bit. He's paying a lot more attention than it looks, but THEY don't need to know that. Such tearful reunions and such quick forgiveness were not things he was familiar with, so he'll pretend they don't exist. Usopp. Interesting name. Reminded him of Milksop. He wondered if there was a connection. ""No, you didn't cause it, the thing that possessed him did.""

Watch carefully as Knives goes from pleasantly neutral to annoyedly menacing in a few seconds, knuckles cracking a bit when he experimentally flexes his fingers, smile positively evil. ""And no, hitting him won't make him go back to normal, but it -will- make me hit /you/."" Smile. ""He'll recover on his own."" Shrug. ""Or something. I'm not very good with soul things. Mostly I just kill people, fixing them is different.""



Milksop my ass! Don't make Luffy hit you!  He has enough spirit left in him for a swift kick to the nuts, at least! ...Wait, do Plants even HAVE--notgoingthere. c_c;;  Nojiko!  You can verify that one for all of us someday. :D;  What does Luffy do after that hug?  PROMPTLY PRETEND there were no tears.  Absolutely not!  Ahem.  They're PIRATES!  Pirates, uh, they don't cry.  Unless it's for nakama.  WHICH NOTHING OF THE SORT JUST HAPPENED AT ALL. C_C;

*keff*

So what happens next?  When Knives says he'd hit Usopp if he tried smacking Luffy to undo the damage, he seizes the marksman by the shoulders and gives Knives a STARE.  Like, 'you wouldn't dare!' or something.  Maybe he thinks by claiming possession of the marksman he can make him immune to damage.  Don't question his logic, even if it's really, really fuzzy right now.  ""...Arlen likes to pretend he's mean.  Kinda like Zoro used to.""  Except then he'd eat a girl's badly made onigiri after it got mushed on the ground.  Stuff like that. ._.



""Sou, sou."" No hitting him? Aww, where's the fun in that? Usopp pulls his hand back out of his bag, hammerless. Steal all his fun, why don't you! The threat of hitting makes him pause for a moment, until the captain grabs him. ""...Luffy."" You really care! You really are back! Well, mostly anyway! ""Oi, Arlen. You have a lot in common with Zoro, don't you?"" The gruff exterior. Being completely whipped by one of the tangerine sisters... Ahem. ""So Luffy will be getting more Luffy over time?"" Reacting up again, Usopp pokes at the side of the rubberman's head several times. ""Maybe Chopper has a Luffy level meter he can use to see how far along he is.""



Knives stares evenly back. You better believe he'd hit Usopp if Usopp smacked Luffy! At least right now, until Luffy's better. Afterwards it's just fine, they can slap eachother silly. ""Who says I'm pretending?"" He kills people for fun! Well, used to. Now he just tortures them, and plays watchdog for Luffy. ""--And I am nothing like that grass-headed imbicile."" Indignant? You bet. Knives crosses his arms over his chest and scowls, eyes slitted closed. ""The only thing we have in common is he's still breathing, and so am I."" He's going to fix that again one day.

...Luffy level meter. One eye pops back open. ""...Yes, something like that."" Over time, sure. ""...Why the hell would you want a meter to figure that out?""



""I don't like it."" Luffy says, with that same blank expression, still holding onto Usopp's shoulders, ""Why do you pretend you're the way you were and you're different around me?""  And likely Nojiko, as well.  Damn Luffy and his tendency to cut to the heart of observed matters!  It's even WORSE when he's not able to shut himself up!  ""Zoro's not an im--im...""  Momentary frustration flits across his face and he lets Usopp go, standing up jerkily to walk over and aim a (light) punch in Knives' stomach.

Except the followthrough winds up with Luffy slipping into one of those mental gray areas and he kind of starts to topple over, vacant-eyed. x_x;



Grass? Naw, Zoro's head is more like a marimo algae. It's too fuzzy for grass. ""Nnnn.. Maybe I could make one. Definitely."" An idea is already coming to him! Mwahaha. Yes, the world will be tested for Luffy. When Luffy makes his comparison, Usopp shakes his head slightly. Try as he might to be big and tough, even around others, Knives is far from what he used to be. He hasn't called aynone a spider in so long! At least not in Usopp's earshot.

""Oi, Luffy..."" Once he no longer has a captain sitting on him, Usopp gets to his feet and turns toward the other two. It isn't until Luffy begins to fall over that he rushes forward, grabbing the rubberman by a shoulder. ""Is that supposed to happen?""



High overhead there appears to be a bird soaring back and forth over the area. At least given the altitude the person's at makes them appear to be a bird. The Morningstar continues his search of the area for Mazikeen, one of the few people he'd consider a friend. And even then, that's only cursory.



Zoro is too an imbicile, and Knives is going to hold to that opinion until he's proven wrong, and given he simply didn't LIKE the swordsman, it could be a while. Even Luffy's agitation at it won't change much, though he might, /might/ be less vocal about his dislike. At least when Luffy's around. ""I'm not pretending, Luffy."" He -is- mean and nasty, he just tries to be *better* around those very few he cares about. That Luffy's punch hurts but isn't enough to knock the wind out of him, nevermind stagger him, marks the Pirate's state of unwellness just fine, and when Usopp catches one side of the toppling Luffy, Knives grabs the other, to support him between them. The circling not-bird far above is outside of Knives' range of easy detection, and so isn't spared a thought or a glance. ""It's been happening on and off."" That doesn't answer whether or not it's -supposed- to happen though. ""He'll come out of it again eventually.""



Is that supposed to happen?  Well, uh.  No, not really.  But what's even the most energetic of pirates to do when all but a sliver of his soul's gotten itself stuck in the mysterious region known as the Ruined Crescent?  Sometimes, WEIRD THINGS happen to perfectly nice people, like instantaneous Darkenings that result in the alienation or harm of one's most precious people.  On the other hand, at least it happened to someone as resilient as Bluefinger Port's very own rubber pirate.

Who IS an imbecile.  But his first mate isn't!

On another note, though, it's nice to have people around who won't let even a guy who can -bounce- hit the floor.  Once steadied he straightens up, but in the way a sleepwalker does.  Otherwise, for a while he only stares, until eyes gradually move upwards.

""...That bird's not a seagull,"" randomly notes Luffy, pointing skywards.  The moment's blank staring is over, it seems.  On and off, indeed.  ""Usopp, your eyes are better.  What kind is it?  Can we eat it?""



Tugging the captain's arm again, Usopp helps to steady him, even after he's back on his own feet. He still isn't quite sure he likes this, but he'll give it some time... And maybe Robin will figure something out soon too! She does have that book the old man gave them.

Can we eat it? If that doesn't say that Luffy's back, nothing does. ""Bird?"" Reaching up his free hand, the marksman lowers his goggles and peers up into the sky. ""It's not a regular bird. Hang on..."" Just give him a few minutes to adjust the lenses here so he can see what that thing is!



The 'bird' continues to hover in the air. The criss-cross pattern it's flying betrays an intelligence lacking in most avian species... at least from this persons universe. Lucifer would include most of the Angelic Host in that category of 'Lacking Intelligence' as well. Once his search of the docks and some of the ships just out to sea, Lucifer begins to descend toward the docks.



The not-bird is given a cursory glance by the Plant, who only is interested until it does /not/ register as undead to his senses. Anything else really isn't a concern right now, including whether or not whatever-it-is is edible. -He's- not hungry, Luffy's /always/ hungry, and god knows how Usopp feels about food. So while Usopp works on seeing what it is, Knives contents himself with making sure Luffy doesn't fall over again. ""Didn't you eat already?""



Luffy doesn't like all this on-again, off-again stuff either, Usopp; it's a source of neverending frustration -and- confusion, especially when he really needs to be able to focus on fixing everything the Darkened captain had tried to wreck in his stead.  Well--he won't worry about it.  He can work hard and keep moving forward, and things will work themselves out eventually, just like they always have, right?

In the meantime, he stares intently in the direction that Usopp does, squinting in concentration.  Eventually, he thinks to tap on the marksman's shoulder, ""So what is it?""  If it's not a regular bird, they can ask Sanji--maybe he knows how to cook it.  In fact... hopefully he does!  But speaking of, where the hell HAS their chef been?  Oh well.  He'll hunt him down later.

What distracts him from shaking Usopp down for the information is Knives' comment.  ""I can eat lots more,"" comes the by now expected response.  ""I bet I can eat more than you.""  ...Now's not the time for a pissing contest on who can eat more, but hey, no one said he was particularly smart.



""Luffy, you could probably out-eat the entire crew twice over."" Usopp grins a bit, but doesn't take his eyes off that descending bird. ""Wait, I see it."" Tongue sticking to the side in concentration, he makes a final adjustment on his goggle lenses. ""Oi, that's not a bird at all. It's a person."" The marksman pauses to consider that for a moment. ""Like someone from Skypiea with bigger wings."" You know, that could actually be used to -fly-. ""I don't think it's good to eat, though. Too much like a person if it isn't an angel from Skypiea.""



Within a few minutes it's quite discernable that the 'bird' is in fact a man with an expansive set of wings. The fact that he's descending toward the very dock that the group is on and staring up toward him gives them the best view. Lucifer finally notices that the three are staring up toward him and decides that perhaps a good scare would do them good. Instead of the gentle descent he was taking a few moments ago, Lucifer pulls the outer edges of his wings back, bringing them almost parallel to his body, causing him to dive fast toward their position.



""...I'm not going to challenge that."" Knives can eat quite a bit when he really wants to, but it's not absolutely necessary. Eating as much as Luffy, however, would be downright impossible and he's not about to try to risk it ANYWAY. When it's pointed out by Usopp that the bird isn't a bird, or a plane, OR Superman, the Plant redirects his attention upwards.

It's hard to miss the intentions of that particular dive - hadn't Knives himself done similar things often enough back on Gunsmoke just to see people scatter when they're not sure if he's going to pull up or not? ""Eating people is definitely out of the question."" Don't mind him if he takes a moment to make sure that he /is/ out of the way in case the plummeting Lucifer /doesn't/ pull up. Being smushed out of arrogance really would put a cramp in his week. Don't mind the step back any.



True enough; Luffy -could-, but only because ever since he ate that cursed Devil Fruit his body's never been quite the same.  Couple Luffy's endless appetite with the ability to stretch like rubber and you really do have Bluefinger Port's biggest money sink as far as edibles go.  At least he sort of makes up for it when adventures result in unexpected treasure.

The youth puts a hand to the front of his head to shield his eyes, other hand on Usopp's shoulder as he leans forward to stare.  ""What?!  A person!?!""  No kidding!  ""I don't wanna eat a person,"" he says flatly, though he does point and practically vibrate with enthusiasm.  ""Sugei!  Sugei!! A guy who can fly!  OOOOI!"" yells the pirate, ""Man-Who-Was-Flying-Just-Now!  Are you a--""

What's the word again?  ""Tourist?""  ....Brilliant.  His raised hand--intent on waving--freezes in midair.  ""Are~?  He's coming this way?""  So, instead of getting the hell out of dodge, it looks like Luffy's just going to stand there stupidly and gawk.  If Lucifer -does-, for whatever reason, happen to crash?  Well, at least it'll be a soft landing.  Kind of.  A perk to being rubber-like.



Something about the way Arlen reacts just occasionally strikes Usopp as funny, and Luffy's usual bonehead remark causes him to glance aside, reaching up to whack the captain lightly on the back of the head. ""Oi, Luffy. Why would a tourist be flying around up there?"" Tourist. Pfff. The marksman looks back up again, just in time to see Lucifer begin to dive. ""Looks like he's coming down."" Uh. He's getting closer. Fast. ""O...oi. Oi! Slow down up there!"" And just to contrast with Knives' calm sidestep and Luffy's mindless stare, Usopp dives to the side and covers his head with his hands.



The descent is made quickly only being stopped as Lucifer extends his wings and pulls back up just as he nears Luffy. The arc he's on shows the precision of his flying ability, as he soars right in front of then straight up of Luffy. Wings still extended, Lucifer descends gently, merely a few inches from Luffy. There's no words of greeting or even recognition toward anyone else, Lucifer is intrigued by the one who didn't jump to the sides and stood there waiting for him to land.



""...I suppose it saves on air fares,"" is Knives' comment on Tourism By Angel. At least Luffy didn't seem interested in eating the other guy now, which was definitely a bonus, and he just shakes his head slightly at the predictable bout of extreme enthusiasm. It was nice to see something so /familiar/, instead of that painful emptiness. When Lucifer manages to /not/ crash horribly and use Luffy as a landing board, the Plant ... feels marginally stupid for getting out of the way, but decides instead to pretend he had his reactions and the whole situation COMPLETELY under control. This mostly translates to him standing there with a faintly disapproving scowl and wondering vaguely if Lucifer would feel pain if he reached over and yanked out a feather.



It's to Luffy's credit, at least, that he ceases gawking when Lucifer makes his skillful landing--and that, dear friend and nakama, is an example of what eons of experience can do to make a complex thing look easy--simply to stare neutrally.  Without skipping a beat, a hand is lifted to shake.

""Monkey D. Luffy.  The man who'll become King of the Pirates.""  Who doesn't much look like one, dressed in denim cut off at the knees, woven-hemp sandals, a red vest and a -lot- of bandages on arms and legs.  In fact, with a disheveled head of black hair and a straw hat, he might well be some farmer who had a bad run-in with a car.

""You're in Bluefinger Port. Who are you?""  Yes, he DOES have that memorized.



Wait. There was no sound of impact? Very slowly, Usopp peeks up, glancing back toward Luffy. Once he sees that the winged man has landed instead of colliding with anyone, he leaps to his feet, raising a hand over his head. Usopp is similarly bandaged to the strawhat, complete with bandages wrapped around his long nose. ""A...hahaha. Good one, right? I bet I had you going there, didn't I?"" And the grin is wide, as Usopp steps right up next to Luffy. ""You can call me Captain Usopp-sama, great warrior of the sea and captain of the Mugiwara pirates!""



The hand isn't taken, as Lucifer continues to watch Luffy with narrowed eyes. ""I shall excuse the insult of staring, whether from afar or up close, because this land is foreign to me."" Lucifer's wings extend again, snapping out closely toward Usopp and Knives on either side of him; whether they get whacked by the wings or not of no consequence to Lucifer. ""You may call me Morningstar. Perhaps we shall meet again, Luffy, Pretender King."" And with that Lucifer launches himself into the air again and quickly ascends.



Morningstar.

Chances are, Luffy's going to forget it, or, just like he -always- does, assign an easier-to-remember nickname that will undoubtedly be used time and time again until he has his real name right.  The price one pays for being a simpleton.  One thing that -does- stand out is being called a Pretender King.  ""...""

""But I'm not Pirate King yet,"" he protests flatly, pointing off in the direction Morningstar flew, looking at Usopp.  ""How can I be a Pretender King if I'm not a King yet?""



Awww, Luffy! Don't correct his lies in front of people! Usopp would probably argue back a bit, if the guy hadn't already flown off. ""Oi, Winged-ossan!"" What was his name? Morning something or other. ""Aww, he left."" And really, why -is- Knives laughing? It took a moment for him to realize that -was- laughing, and once he does, he turns to face the Plant. ""Yeah, what's so funny, Arlen?""



""Because he thinks he's the devil."" This might not mean much to -them-, but Knives heard enough of christianity over the years to find it terribly, horribly amusing. ""Except the Devil has red skin, bat wings, a pitchfork, horns and a tail. Or is wearing a red dress. -He- had none of the above."" Knives shakes his head, choking down another giggle and returning to all appearances of his usual sobriety. ""...Morningstar."" ....Giggle.



""Devil?  What, like Devil Fruit?""  Luffy asks, looking towards Knives, baffled.  Yeah, there isn't much a guy like Luffy can learn about religion when it simply hasn't a single influence in his life at all.  Sure!  There's churches and funerals and priests and stuff, but he never really cared to learn about any of it.

""Star-ossan.  Okay.""  That's easy to remember.  ""A red dress?  So, is the devil an okama?""  ...He pauses a moment, and then looks towards Usopp, then to Knives.  ""I mean, is he gay?""  Oh wow, he even wore a suit like that Kama-Kama Fruit user!  He was kind of fruity. c_c;  But this guy, Star-ossan, didn't seem much like him at all!

""I don't know, he seemed like one of those important people.""  Just a feeling.  And then he shrugs, lapsing into silence.



As the Plant begins describing the devil, Usopp crosses his arms and nods. ""Sou, sou. I met him once, you know. Not a nice guy. Definitely no feathers."" He nods again, uncrossing his arms so he can run a thumb against the side of his nose. ""I taught him not to mess with Usopp, though!"" 

Luffy gets a long look... ""I don't think he was an okama. But it's not always easy to tell!"" Naw, couldn't be. That would be strange. ""This winged ossan didn't seem like him at -all-.""



Knives shakes his head. ""No, like the Prince of Darkness, creator of evil everywhere. Sometimes it's a blue dress."" Devil Fruit might be from the Devil but he had his doubts. Luffy certainly didn't seem terribly corrupted by the forces of Darkness. Luffy makes it very difficult to try to keep a straight face once he asks if Lucifer was gay, and the Plant can only shrug.

""Who knows. He might be. I doubt he's too important, despite the suit."" He'll put his psionics to good use next time he runs into the winged man and see if he can't actually find out. ""...Hey, Pinnochio."" A pause. ""Usopp."" Whichever it was. ""Why did you claim to be the captain?"" Most people might not question such a thing, but Knives did. Maybe he'll be surprised, and Usopp will say his intention was to protect Luffy from further harm if Lucifer was looking for the captain of the Straw Hats for a fight. ""...And when did you meet the Devil?""



Judging from how quiet Luffy's gotten, he might well have slipped mentally again, except this one seems shorter.  He looks up abruptly, blinking, and wastes no time in saying, ""You met him?  See, Arlen?  No way he could've been the Devil, Usopp met him!""  He doubletakes at Usopp, eyes wide.  ""You met him?  SUGEI.""

Most gullible. Captain.  Ever.

And also happens to be one of the most innocent, to go around asking if the Devil is gay, without the slightest inkling of why it might cause people to look at him funny.  ""Usopp's so lucky.  We met a god before, and then I fought that bird-god, Roc, but I've never met the Devil.""  He drops a fist into one palm.  ""I know!  One of these days I'll find the Devil and challenge him to a fight!  It'll be really cool!""



""Captain Usopp-sama!"" Be correct in addressing him! ""Because I am the captain."" Nevermind what Luffy says. At all. And Luffy's reaction doesn't help at all. In fact, he begins to puff up a bit, grinning widely and standing proudly. ""It really wasn't a big deal. I ran into him on one of my adventures before I met Luffy and Zoro and Nami for the first time.""

Reaching over to the rubberman, Usopp pats him on the shoulder. ""You should be glad I never challenged him to a fight then! Otherwise there wouldn't be anything left for you. He's kinda tricky, but I bet you could take him!""



And once more Knives is forced to wonder how the hell these pirates survived as long as they did with all limbs intact and their hearts still in their chests. ""You're not the captain,"" the Plant points out. ""The rubberman is."" That won't work on him! And he /knows/ damn well Usopp didn't come across the Devil! ...If only because he's pretty sure the Devil doesn't exist. Ahem. ""I'm suddenly finding myself having to second-guess my decision to make you help keep an eye on Luffy."" Would Usopp even be able to?

""....Luffy, fighting the Devil would not be 'really cool'. It'd be /hot/. Like getting a bunch of wood together, setting it on fire, and jumping right in the middle of the bonfire. Can you handle those?"" Doesn't rubber melt? He didn't particularly want a melted pirate onhand. ""--Oi, Pinnochio. If he goes and jumps in any fires, get him out.""



""You met him on that island?""  Great, now you've encouraged him, Usopp.  Let's just hope he forgets all about it, or one day Lucifer might find the pirate marching into his nightclub at Middleton asking him if he knows where the Devil is, and why he's looking for him.  Chances are, he'd get a nasty surprise.  Fortunately, though, it doesn't seem fire effects Luffy in any way different than most humans.  Funny thing, that.  And still electricity doesn't do much more than tingle.

This isn't, however, an invitation to experiment. c_c;  Meanwhile, Luffy's still fanboying at Usopp.  Until he stops, abruptly.  ""You're still not captain,"" flatly answers Mugiwara, and then he turns his attention to the Plant.  ""...It wouldn't?  Fire?  Well, uh...""  A long, long pause in silence, and he shakes his head.  ""I'd burn.  I can try it, though.""  For gods' sakes, don't. ""He's Usopp.""



And how do you know the devil doesn't exist, you're so smart? Usopp just said he met the guy, didn't he? ""Luffy won't go around jumping into fires. And It's Usopp! Usopp!"" He doesn't even know who this Pinocchio character is! The marksman raises his hand again, opens his mouth to say something... then sort of droops a bit as Luffy shuts him down again. ""I'm still replacement captain whenever you're busy though! You can even be in charge of the cannons for a day if you want.""



""...Don't try it."" Don't stress Knives out even more! Sure, it's his fault for mentioning it to begin with, but he won't acknowledge that. The more people repeat Usopp's name, however, the more Knives is tempted to keep deliberately getting it wrong, just to be a pain in the ass. ""No fighting the Devil, okay? Wait til you're better."" Or preferably NEVER, kthx. ""--And playing with the cannons can also wait."" Knives, pirate babysitter. ""As much as I'd like to see you two blow yourselves to Kingdom Come, I'd prefer if you held off until everything's back to whatever passes for normal.""



Don't try it.  ""Okay,"" Luffy says--but the pirate needn't sound like Luffy's disappointed to be missing out on something that sounds fun.  Nah, he'll realize he's being dumb in about... five, six minutes.  However, Usopp's response seems to give him something else to think about, and he puts his hand up to cup his chin thoughtfully, the other hand cradling his elbow.  A foot taps.

""....Okay.  You're captain until I'm better.""  Luffy says, grinning.  ""I can't be a good captain until I've earned my nakama's trust again, and that's gonna take a while if I keep shutting off!""  He claps Usopp on the shoulder and turns around quickly, marching towards the ship.  Well, that was said rather cheerfully.



""And besides--"" Huh? Wait, what? That was definitely unexpected. ""I, uh... of course I'm the captain!"" Didn't Chopper say Usopp won the duel right before he passed out? So of course he won captaincy! ""Oi, Knives is right. You can go look for the devil to fight after you're all better, Luffy."" Knives is given a long look... before Usopp just grins and raises a fist over his head. ""Yoush! You're right, the cannons aren't toys. That's why they need to be test fired! But not until Luffy's better."" Such a delicate operation could only be done by him, and doing so is below a captain! So therefore, it will have to wait until Luffy is able to be captain again. Usopp logic. ""Oi, Luffy, wait up!"" Usopp wants to be sure he's next to the rubberman in case he collapses again!



If Usopp is so determined to make sure Luffy doesn't hit the ground if he falls over again, then Knives is going to take the luxury of trailing along behind them at a leisurely pace. No, he's not going to stay off the ship, not for now. He still had things to worry about. ""...Hey, temporary captain. Keep an eye on him for a while."" Usopp will have no idea just how much trust he's going to give the sniper with this particular assignment. Luffy is -his- pet project. ""If he starts acting normal for longer than five minutes at a stretch, or starts acting like that parasite, come find me immediately."" What's Knives going to do?

Delicately rebuild the mental shields he'd had down for the past day, cutting off the hum and babble of the thoughts of everyone in Bluefinger, and find somewhere to take a damn nap.



Every five min--hey, good point.  That IS a good indicator.  Because if he ISN'T staring off into space or suddenly losing balance or track of what he's doing or saying at least once every ten minutes, something is up.  Fortunately, the Darkened parasite is somewhere off licking his wounded pride in the Ruined Crescent and thinking of revenge.  Unfortunately, none of those present know that.

Luffy slings an arm around Usopp's shoulders and stops after a few steps, turning partway to look at Knives.  ""Sankyu na, Arlen.""  Thanks.  ""Yosh!  Iku ze, Captain Usopp!"" says Luffy vacantly, kind of throwing a fist dizzily into the air.  Yes!  Up the ramp and onto the Going Merry!  Because he wants to sit down for a while. @_@"

"event","Knives returns with their spiritually emancipated (read: UnDarkened) captain.  Luffy is repentant but lacks the ability to fully express himself thanks to being reduced to a fragment of his soul.  Nami is acting even more feline than ever!  Zoro, as usual, is one of the least informed members of the crew (that poor swordsmen must get a taste of this confusion every single story arc!), and Nojiko gets rather incriminating!

Later, Albedo shows up and has a discussion with Knives (and later, Luffy) about the things that tie people together.

<lj-cut text=""Your apology is -cheap-!"">

The summer evening extends cool shadows long across the docks, wood planks ringing with footfalls as even the waning hours of daylight are filled with activity here.  Orders are shouted over the heads of laborers, gossip swapped between mariners wrapping up the day's work.  A few last-minute hagglers trying to get a bargain with the left-over fish that didn't sell at market exchanging words and coin.

There is no conversation shared between Plant and Pirate, though not exactly by choice.  Luffy would have loved to chat pleasantly about all manner of things had this been any other time, but a lot has happened, and right now?  He's a little prone to distraction in things more often than usual.  In short, he'd look stoned if he weren't kind of, uh, bleeding everywhere.

It's not life threatening!  There's just a lot of cuts on arms, legs and sides where a certain Alchemist and his brother bashed him into spikes that sprouted out of the ground.  Hah, he's been through A LOT worse, and it has little to do with his vacant stare.  However, being hungry has -everything- to do with the fact he's leaning heavily on Knives' arm, walking automatically.  Hey, if it weren't for all the bloodstains, he'd look kind of drunk, maybe.



My my what a state our Captain is in! ... as for Corpses. Uh. Well. Not -HUMAN- corpses no. But there are -feathers- scattered across the deck of the ship, like someone had one helluva pillow fight. Feathers both large and small, that is. While Nami would have liked to have been at the ship last night, Yoruichi-sama had other plans. The girl is currently seated - of all places - in the branches of her tree, a white kerchief tied taut over her head, and Rinoa's coat draped across her back. Nothing to see here, doo de doo. 
 
The scent of blood and two familiar people get her to lift her head and shift a little, pushing a branch down as she peers through the leaves. One quick movement, her hand darting towards her mouth briefly, and she climbs down out of the tree, hopping the rest of the way to look towards the ramp. And don't mind the dead bird bodies okay? Uh. She didn't do it. I swear.



At least Knives doesn't have to carry Luffy at this point. It's not as if he'd complain if he did, but since he didn't, that was a lot less energy he had to expend. It's easier to support someone on their own feet than carry someone, after all. One would think he'd spent the whole day in a marathon, not ten minutes rooting out a parasite. It seemed like a lot longer on the inside. /He/ wasn't cut to ribbons, or bleeding everywhere; the bleeding from his nose and ears had finally stopped, and he wasn't staining his clothes with it anymore.

That was good too. He didn't like the coolness of the evening. Hotter was better. ""Hm?"" It takes him a moment to figure out whether Luffy was asking if -they- were dead, or if someone else was. This is processed sluggishly, as is the answer. ""...We're not dead."" Being dead doesn't hurt this much. He's not exactly sure, never having been dead, but how could it? ""... Don't think your nakama are either."" Desimir was supposed to keep an eye on everything,a nd the Gray hadn't said anything about deaths.

Inhale slowly, pull sea air in through mouth and nose. Note the smell of someone else's blood than theirs. ""Unless you have ..well, had. A bird on your ship."" He's not aware of Carue, and so he dismisses the thought. Catty goings-on aren't noticed. That would require thought, and thinking hurts right now.



It's not that bad!  Think of it like being on a somewhat permanent high, or at least, that's kind of how it looks, if you ignore all the cuts.  Considering what the formerly Darkened captain put his nakama and an Alchemist through, he got off really easy.  None of his injuries are even life-threatening.  He probably had it worse fighting -Kuro-, and that one wasn't anywhere near as crazy as the fight with Crocodile or Arlong or God-Eneru!

...Don't cats usually arrive and preen in front of their slain foes in order to get praise for a job well done?  Luffy and Knives walk up the gangplank onto the ship, and the pirate lets go of Knives' arm in favor of a new distraction.  Namely, toeing curiously at a dead bird with a glazed-over, blank stare.  He seems vaguely confused as to why dead birds would be found on his ship, but given that he doesn't flip out, he probably didn't assume his crew turned into birds and died or something. c_c;

Especially since he's lucid enough at present to notice (belatedly) some movement out of the corner of his eye.  Luffy straightens up, overcompensates his weight without realizing it, and kind of topples over.  Oh, hey, look at that sky... wasn't he doing something?  Oh, yeah.  Sitting up. c_c;;  ""...A bird?""

This takes a lot more thought than it should take, or maybe Luffy forgot he asked a question.

""...Not this small.""  He glances aside, ""...""  Taking in a deep breath, he pulls off his hat, falls back onto the deck, and puts his hat over his eyes.  ""....NAKAMA!"" he calls, adding lower, ""You here?""




Give her a minute - she was debating on something. She just couldn't remember exactly what it was. Mouth full, she is quick to respond with a muffled, 'MRrah?' and trotting down the steps quickly. You're hOOOOOOOME! You're home you're home you brought that two legger I can't stand but you're home and you look okay but you're hurt and ... here, have a bird. It's a present fr you! o/~
 
Nami opens her mouth and spits out a small canary, which plunks to the deck, fluttering about in a small panic. @.@ And after a wary glance at Knives --- you can't have it! It's for the Captain! -- She leans towards Luffy curiously for a sniff. Hff hff. Boy you can't stay out of trouble for a SECOND can you!
 
The fluttering bird gets her attention for a second before she blinks once, hops back two steps and licks at the back of her hand, then rubs at her face. Look at her, all sleepy eyed and unpresentable! Aha! ha..ha -err.. another long look at Luffy, and, ""Wassssgoin on?"" She mumbles in half a hiss from behind a hand that's rubbing her face. Why is Luffy all bloody?



""Didn't I tell you to take it easy?"" Knives reaches down to haul Luffy back to his feet when the Pirate goes over - while lying there might not exactly be bad for Luffy, there's little corpses all over, and god knows what diseases they're carrying and he doesn't think he can fight infections as well as he can fight people. If Luffy got sick, it's not his fault. 

Nami's arrival and less than human attitude and manner of speaking is familiar enough to earn her a long, level stare from the Plant when she spits out the bird. So it's contagious, hm? Nojiko hadn't mentioned her sister had the same affliction, and since he KNOWS they're not related by blood, it's not genetic. He should really think about doing something about that statue she mentioned. With Nami present, however, all traces of lingering pain dissapear from Knives, who but for the blood seems abrubtly as alert and annoyed as ever.

What's going on? ""Where's the doctor everyone says is on this ship?"" If these two don't think he's in command of the situation, they're making a mistake. ""If he's here, I suggest you find him. Your captain ran afoul of the Elric brothers, and then got a parasite ripped off his soul, he's in rough shape."" And does not need to be lying about out -here-. Better to be lying about somewhere indoors, with someone to take care of the bleeding and aquire food for the Straw Hat Black Hole.



Someone's... sniffing at him.  Luffy's fingers twitch the hat up out of his eyes, which aside from looking vacant in the way someone high on a lot of euphoric chemicals might, do eventually focus on the navigator, eyes narrowing as if someone just woken out of deep sleep is trying to make sense of someone gibbering frantically about a burglar, or something along those lines.

"".....""  A sluggish blink, and he sits up on an elbow, eyes drawn to the fluttering, panicked canary.  Nami's 'grooming' of herself gets a blank stare.  He slowly picks the canary up off the floor in a cage of fingers, ""....""  Damn it.  The way he is now, sometimes even the ability to speak coherantly drifts a little out of reach.  It's how the remnants of his spirit isn't fitting right inside all the empty space in his body, so he just waits until it returns again.

So he's prone to long pauses, distracted stares, that sort of thing.  Not very thrilling company, but give him time, he just got emancipated little more than an hour ago.  Knives, during this silence, hauls him to his feet, where he kind of teeters a little while he tries to multitask -standing still- with -not crushing the birdy-, but it's a good time as any for the Plant to fill her in.

He seems, meanwhile, absolutely -fascinated- with the fluttering thing in his hands.  Hat perched precariously on his head, he crouches again (he won't lie down, promise), staring intently past the bird caged in his fingers at the grooming navigator.  ""...Thank you.""

""...""  Doctor.  ""...Chopper,"" replies Luffy automatically.  ""....""  As for where he is, he doesn't offer any useful information, only staring at the navigator.  ""Can I eat this?"" he mumbles into the cage of his fingers.  BAD LUFFY.  BAD. C_C;  Don't go asking the cat-like Nami for permission to put things in your mouth!



Speaking of -not very thrilling company-, Zoro had heard the call for nakama and pulled himself out of a hammock to see what the commotion was about. Three katanas are strapped to his right hip and a hand is run through his short green hair before as he takes the stairs into the cabin and then outside onto the deck of the Going Merry. He comes around the platform and down the steps to the main deck area, a frown appearing on his lips at the sight of Arlen being here with Luffy.

         Things have been stranger than usual around here with Nami killing birds and Nojiko killing his shirts. u.u; And now that Plant is back? ""Nami!"" He calls to the navigator, wanting her to come back away from where she is and over towards him. Whether she will or not who knows, cats have their own mind, but Arlen isn't the only one who gets a cold stare, it's Luffy too. Could Zoro be blamed after seeing what Luffy did to Usopp last night? Even if Usopp did challenge him for captainship. 



No touchie Yoruichi-sama! >.< RAR! HISS! Nami licks her lips absently as she watches the bird fluttering about in Luffy's cage-fingers. Poor little bird. It gets harassed by cats and now by human --well, sorta humans. Nami's at least had presence of mind to cover up her ears and tail before she lost herself to the cat again.
 
Luffy's words of thanks get a glance from Nami, who had up till that point been ignoring the both of them so she could finish grooming. Or at least, she made a good /show/ of ignoring them. She did hear every word, but Nami addresses the Captain first. Point. ""Toy."" It's still alive, therefore, it isn't food yet. IT's still energetic enough to play with - and its wings were broken so it wasn't going to get away anytime soon. Then to Knives.
 
""Ssshoppurrrrr? Gone."" Somewhere. Or off shopping. You know, if it wasn't something that concerned her directly, she didn't really care. Zoro's call gets Nami to glance towards him, where she shifts her weight, and pads around the ship in a circuit. Oh look, something shiny! Oh look, a feather! Lemme play with that for a few minutes. Oh look, a bird passing by! Oh look, I smell FISH! Here, lemme sit on the railing for a few minutes more. Oh look, Zoro! 
 
FINALLY she pads over and reaches Zoro's side, where she weaverubs past him briefly, ""..bandages."" She should get those, for Luffy, right? Without paying Zoro any further mind - though the tail beneath her coat does brush against Zoro's leg in passing, she trots downstairs.
 
Gone for a few minutes, something small and white bounces across the deck, followed by Nami - batting the roll of bandages across the floor. Was she doing something important a minute ago? Once the bandages stop rolling, now fully unrolled across the deck, she loses interest and wanders over to the mast, stretching and scritching her fingernails against it. Rrrrrrrrrr.



Knives does not a good nursmaid make. People ate chickens, would a canary be anything different? Then again, it might be dirty, and Nami /drooled/ on it. "".... Wash it first."" Gone. Of course the medic would be gone. Why would anything ever work in his favor? Nami's feline antics are -expected- by the Plant, and thus aren't seen as particularly alarming just yet, raising one hand to scrub at his ear and scowl at the blood that comes away. Stupid backlash. Stupid Luffy being all zoned out. Why does /he/ have to be the only one thinking even remotely normally? He hates responsibility!

At least Nami's off to find bandages (Hello, Zoro, don't mind the vaguely irritated Plant on deck, yes he is back but for god knows how long), so Knives actually believes she'll return with them. Surely she can do that at least. He matches Zoro glare for glare until Nami comes back and .... bats the bandages around. ""...Right."" Looks like he has yet another task to handle himself. Rummaging through his pockets for a moment, Knives comes up with a small paper bag, which is opened, the smallish round object within pulled out and flicked in Nami's direction. Bag goes back into the pocket. ""Looks like I get to play doctor. Come on, you."" He'll /ignore/ Zoro as best he can (which doesn't really work, but he tries!) in favor of seeing if he can get Luffy off the deck and somewhere a little more enclosed. ""Where does your doctor keep his stuff?""

Meanwhile, the catnip ball originally meant for Nojiko rolls sedately across the deck.



Nami, the way you're acting is really, really distracting.  Luffy loses his train of thought - not entirely uncharacteristic on a normal day for him - and ...drops the fluttering bird.  Oops.  Hopefully, the short fall doesn't break its neck or something.  Though maybe that might be for the best, considering the poor thing is currently a cat toy. ._.;

There's nothing quite like a good, cold stare can do to remind one of unpleasant truths, like what's been going on here for the last few weeks.  Luffy's current state, lacking most of his spirit and therefore being a little on the 'flaky' side, finds it really easy to get caught up in the now instead of what's more important, like dealing with the repurcussions of what started in the Ruined Crescent.

As any responsible multiple would tell you, the host will consider themselves just as responsible for any sins committed with their body.  Only the irresponsible would ever blame their poor behavior on another inhabiting their body.  It's the same in Luffy's case; he was possessed, but he still will do everything in his power to make up for the days of hell he put his most precious people through.

Was someone saying something about making sure wounds wouldn't get infected?  Well, Luffy will still use those bandages, he's used dirtier material, like a certain Plant's cloak that first time they fought.  The gauze is currently disregarded in favor of knees hitting the deck, followed by bloody palms.

And the brim of a straw hat bent a little when he presses his forehead down on it, bowing.  ""Gomen nasa--Ah?!""  His straw hat gets left behind when the back of his vest is grabbed and the rubber pirate goes dragging along with, looking very bewildered.



Zoro glances down to eye the strange things Nami does and then shakes his head a bit. Maybe they're all losing their minds or something. He doesn't feel too stable at the moment either. But having Arlen around will do that to a moody swordsman. Slow on the uptake, he just doesn't know what the hell is going on around here. Why did Luffy do what he did to his own nakama? Sure he escaped dream pranks but seeing the fight last night put a lot on his mind.

         Now Luffy's apologizing for it? He wishes Nami had her sense back or Robin were here. Zoro doen't know how to handle such a strange situation. All he can identify is the personal confusion and pain he feels at seeing the Captain he would follow into hell treat his own nakama so badly. ""You're sorry?! What the f*ck is the matter with you! Your apology is -cheap-!"" Zoro doesn't even know half of what Luffy's done! But he saw enough to make him his usual angry self.



Pausing from where she's ineffectively scratching the mast, Nami turns her head. What /is/ that intoxicating scent? Ah - there it is. Coming from that enticing little ball rolling across the deck. Abandonin the mast, she drops to all fours, the tip of her tail twitching excitedly. The thing isn't even /alive/ and she feels the need to -stalk- it. Stalk. Stalk. Stalk. 
 
A little closer.. a little closer.. and.. POUNCE! Nami leaps! Catches the ball in her paw---er, hands, and rubs her cheek against it. Oh I love you catnip. PUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRR! *_* A rather drunken giggle escapes while Nami is in the middle of wriggling on her back against the deck, though at Zoro's sudden shout, she starts, flipping over to her stomach with a wild eyed glare. What? Who's he yelling at?
 
More importantly, when's dinner?



""Apologize later."" It's a sad day when a murderer is more reliable in defense and help than one's own nakama, isn't it? Knives has his own agenda, and that doesn't include bowing and scraping to a bunch of idiots who didn't have the wit to stay out of the Ruined Crescent to begin with. He owed them nothing, and had no reason to even be remotely polite. A catnip ball will have to do for keeping Nami off his back and in a euphoric high, which seems to be working deliriously well. -One- thing going right. At least Knives has the sense to stop, turn, and grab the hat, -then- resume hauling Luffy off. ""Focus for me, Luffy. Chopper. Where's his stuff?""

He'd find Nami's antics cute if he didn't have other things to worry about. Like a bleeding Luffy. Stuffing the hat back on the pirate, Knives points a finger at the green haired swordsman, voice practically dripping venom. ""Shut the hell up. After everything he's been through, you should be on your knees kissing his feet for holding on because of you people instead of just giving up, you ungrateful bastard."" Knives ... is not going to be able to win a fight with -anyone- right now if things explode into violence, but he'll be damned if he lets anyone know. ""You lost the right to whine and bitch when you did NOTHING when he got possessed in the first place!"" Hey a door. Knives shoves it open and drags Luffy through. God knows where it leads, we'll find out in a moment. ""What's in here, anyway?""

Dinner will be served in a little while, kitty.



Hey, Zoro?  He'd really love to go into it with you, but he's limited to short sorta-sentences and whatever simple gestures he can manage through living in a haze that could be best described as 'running on vapors in the gas tank'.  Which means his anger comes not as a surprise, but it does get a dismayed, bewildered look, not so much aimed at his reaction than a visible sense of being at a total loss of what to do in the face of it.  At least this means he's so busy trying to figure out what the hell he's doing that he doesn't give Knives any trouble.

And it's -totally- a shame he completely misses Nami's antics, because he would have undoubtedly been supremely amused on reflecting on it at a later time.  Luffy opens his mouth and closes it a few times without managing to say anything, wearing an expression of extreme concentration, and then shakes his head.

Reliable in defense.  Well, the Plant DID come to warn everyone, but no one believed him because of actions taken.  This time, because of actions taken, his nakama are suspicious, angry, betrayed--it's all for very good reasons.  Sometimes, even the truth will go unheard.  In Luffy's case, it's simply something too complicated for his current state; he simply can't understand why he's thinking disjointedly, why he can't concentrate, why it sometimes seems like people are speaking in foreign languages, only to understand them minutes later.

Focus.  Luffy frowns, thinking.  ""....A bag in...""  Another delay.  He snaps to attention and blurts out, ""Guy's sleeping quarters below.""  THERE!  Got it! He'd be terribly proud of himself if it weren't for the fact that...he really fucked things up. ._.;  ""Nf,"" as his hat is shoved on his head.

And then Knives is yelling.  ""O-OI! THAT'S MY FIRST MATE--"" is Luffy's shouted protest, right before he's dragged into a door.  Storage.  The rest of his rant is muffled and eventually trails off in distraction.  Oh, hey, he found the other box of medical supplies.

The rant goes a little something like:

""--YOU IDIOT!  -MY- NAKAMA GOT HURT AND COULDN'T DO ANYTHING--""

""--I couldn't do anything--""

""--.../I/--""

""...I'm sorry.  Shutting up.  ...Antisep--ngh.""  That'd be Luffy getting vacant-eyed and droopy again.  Whee. @_@



Possessed? What is everyone talking about! Zoro doesn't stop to figure it out when Knives is shouting at him. He just knows he doesn't like that guy and that's enough reason for him to be an ass! c_cv ""Get the fuck off this ship!"" Zoro at least restrains himself enough not to try and remove Knives by force, but don't think he doesn't consider it! Argh! He's so confused! The swordsman turns and kicks his foot into a barrel, breaking it to pieces scattering onto the deck. Like that guy owns the place or something!

         Zoro isn't sure what's going on with Luffy but he doesn't like it. And since he can't figure it out he just fumes and stalks across the deck further, looking for something else to kick. >.<;



ARNUMNUM! Catnipball! *.@ Catn..ca...nn.. ca....
 
Nami blinks.
 
""....."" A hand lifts to her mouth briefly, and she /KAFFS/, spitting out the catnip ball she'd been chewing on. o O ( ... not /again/. ) She raises a hand and rubs at her face - snickers fiercly and slaps a hand over her mouth. o O ( Damnit this isn't funny! What am I giggling for? )
 
No kicking the kitty, Zoro! Nami glances over her shoulder at the sound of something going SMASHIE, and regards the smashed bits of barrel. ..... *POINT* ""PFFFFFWUAHAAHahahahahahah!!"" Again, her hands go over her mouth and she turns away in mild frustration. Damnit. Stop LAUGHING.
 
Damn Catnip.



""Blow it out your ass."" Knives, pointedly, kicks the door shut to the storage room in the middle of Zoro yelling at him. There is no better way to stop a conversation dead in its tracks, as teens everywhere find out when they do it to their parents. Additionally, now he can honestly say he had no idea what Zoro was saying, which was, in Knives' opinion of the swordsman, always a good thing. And now, he'll think of other things, like medicine bags in the quarters below. Knives glances at the decking and frowns, then glances around for some form of a /door/. In the storage room, of course there isn't one except the one that leads back to the deck and to a bathroom. And the hatch in the floor, but that can't be right. He'll investigate anyway, pulling it open and peeking down the stairs. ...that can't be right. Close the hatch again. ""...That can't be it."" Looked too fluffy for guy's quarters.

""I know he's your first mate,"" Knives mutters in response to Luffy's agitated ranting, giving the Pirate a bit of a push as antiseptic is handed over. ""Sit."" He just doesn't /care/ what Zoro is. Zoro does not matter in his worldview. ""You already did a lot to help them, Luffy. If you hadn't, they'd be -dead- instead."" They're just all too STUPID to realize it. Mmm, medical supplies. Knives amuses himself by rummaging through it, and setting aside anything he thinks might be useful.

He'd kill for some good old fashioned duct tape right now, but bandages and antiseptic will have to do. EB Green would be nice too. Beggars, he supposes, can't be choosers. ""This is going to hurt."" Why is it going to hurt? Because Knives is going to make use of one of those barrels of water and a cloth, and scrub the blood off of Luffy before any bandaging happens. And he's not gentle in favor of being thorough.

The worst part of having kicked the door shut, Knives thinks, is not having any idea what Zoro just kicked and why Nami is laughing. Curiosity is a horrible thing, and it's chewing at him.



That's right.  As usual, Zoro's probably the least informed on the ship.  Gee, for First Mate, he certainly gets overlooked when it comes time to share information, doesn't he?  It's tradition, probably a lot like flinging Zoro uncomfortably into hard, unforgiving objects while injured.  (Hey, Zoro!  Switch! *fling*)  Luffy would love to explain, but he's kind of as clueless himself.  Well, he KNOWS he was possessed, but he's not sure why he feels so ... uh, so stupid.  Really stupid.  Like someone scooped out all his insides and left the leavings, like the leftover ice cream found in a mostly empty carton.

Like right now?  He's having another of those gray areas between (somewhat) lucid moments, one of those wherein he looks relatively STONED, or at least like the lights are on and no one's home.  Or a life-sized puppet with no strings.  Actually, that's kind of disturbing. c_c;  But there's nothing fluffy and cute about missing a vast majority of your soul!  Hell, that shouldn't even FUNCTION--except this is the Dream, and funny things happen in the Dream.

Sit.  Luffy does.  And his nakama -aren't- stupid!  They're wonderful people with beautiful dreams and --probably... really... really don't like him right now.  It's the funniest thing; he can hear things just fine during these spaced-out moments, it's just reacting to them is impossible.  It's like being partially catatonic.  And that washing?  REALLY FREAKING HURTS, KNIVES. @_@;;  And like a fingersnap, it's back again.  Lucidity.

He isn't watching Knives do his work, but shoulders twitch when he sniffs sharply.  Awjeez. -_o  Is he crying?  He's certainly pretending he AIN'T.  Uh, see the hat?  It's, um, it's dust.  Really.  Because he's not going to cry in front of the Plant.  THAT'S EMBARRASSING. >_<;;



Zoro stalks across the ship to the front and turns to lean against the rail with his arms crossed moodily over his shoulders. He doesn't have anything else to say with Knives slamming the door. He's not going to go and bang on it and shout through the door at him, even if the urge is there. Why is Knives here bringing Luffy back from somewhere? Why is Luffy hurt? Why is he acting so strangely? Maybe Knives is the one behind all this! c_c; Hah! He's figured it out, you evil, evil man! Zoro bows his chin and thinks about it some more, an eyebrow twitching and his muscles tensing up along his crossed arms. Maybe Knives is just trying to be a friend and help Luffy. Or maybe he's trying to get onto this ship as one of the crew. That seems to happen a lot lately. A strange blond girl he heard about, a cross dresser, and that little shipwright he knows less about than he knows about Robin! Well, he won't accept Arlen either! Only when hell freezes over!



Okay, what the hell is going on? Nojiko was -trying- to take her upteenth nap of the day, but the effort was cut short by all manner of yelling and cursing and banging....someone's about to be shredded. The footsteps are heavy as they stomp up from below deck, the door shoved open as she looks for the first person to vent her rage on.
 
""Oi, Zoro!"" Oh god, not her too! She marches over to the swordsman, wherever he may be, lips already parting to accuse. But it falls suddenly short. Something about his expression. ""What is it?"" Forgive her if she's a little confused at first...sleep cobwebs and all. z.z;



Meanwhile, Nami is sitting on the floor of the ship, staring at the door that Knives kicked shut. The urge to claw the door open is nearly overwhelming. Thankfully the influence of catnip keeps her otherwise occupied. As Nojiko emerges to MARCH over to the swordsman, Nami's lips twitch lightly, ""N..nnnnno.. no.."" Wait. She'll get this right. ""Nojiko -"" not quite right, but getting there. 
 
Gleefully, she gets to her feet, pausing only to stumble. It's like she doesn't even have her sea legs! Oh my would she be ashamed of herself. ""He..hee.ehee!"" She lifts a hand still clutching the catnip ball and POINTS. ""..hee! Kkgh.."" She doubles over again, arms wrapping around her waist as she breaks into a sudden, drunken laughing /FIT/. ""Lu..Lu.. LuHeeeeheeheehee! A..an..an!"" She points impotently at the door. Then at Zoro, ""An' he kICKED it!"" Which is apparently SO funny that she has to gasp for breath. ""BWAM!!"" She collapses onto her side, tucking into the fetal position and giggling harder. Augh, where did that catnip ball go? She's gotta get rid of that thing.



At least Knives doesn't go 'this will only hurt a little'. He knows how things always hurt more when that's said. Especially when needles are involved. Ugh. If he were any more humane he might have offered painkillers, but this is a genocidal maniac here, they're lucky he's not using Luffy for an anatomy lesson on what internal organs look like on the outside. At least he's nice enough to bandage various injuries as he scrubs, so they don't get all messy and bleed everywhere again, forcing him to scrub Luffy down a second time.

The sniffling is picked up on when it begins. But he purposely fails to take any notice, and will continue to not notice until there isn't anything to not notice anymore. It's only polite, after all, and he didn't like people staring at -him- when he (most definitely was NOT) crying, so why would Luffy want someone to?

When aspirin is found in the kit, however, Knives promptly eats a handful, the bitter taste extremely unpleasant. But maybe they'll do something for his splitting migrane. Mm, bandages. The antiseptic is toyed with a bit before being put to use after he reads the directions. Taking people apart was nothing like putting them back together. ""Just relax a bit, alright? I'll explain to everyone what happened. They'll forgive you. Forgive yourself when they do."" Not that he expects anyone to actually listen. They haven't yet.

... What IS going on out there? C_C




None of Luffy's injuries are nearly deep enough for a lesson on internal organs, and Luffy wouldn't let him even TRY to take a look.  He's not a lab rat!  Just finish what you're doing and stop TOUCHING those wounds, it hurts!  It hurts like a bitch!  At least he was kind of zoning mentally for the most of it, which means there's a minimum of interference or resistance.  As Chopper knows, he's a bad patient.  You know, runs around while injured, unless he's asleep.

He'd vocalize appreciation for letting him get that done with, especially without commentary, except they're mutually pretending Luffy wasn't just spending the next few minutes crying.  He just scrubs at his face with a gauze-wrapped arm and clears his throat awkwardly.

""....""

What IS all that noise? C_C;

Luffy catches Knives looking that way and... stands up, whether or not he's finished completely with the bandaging, to pull open the door, crouching to peer out of it, eyes wide.  ""....""

""....""  o_o;  ""................""  He looks up, pointing towards the two girls, giving Knives a bewildered look.  He means to say, 'The hell is going on?' but lacks words again for the moment.



Zoro is more than a little curious about what's going on inside the ship as well. He knows Knives and Luffy are friends but that doesn't mean he trusts Knives around Luffy. He wouldn't trust anything around Knives! And then Nojiko comes up onto deck and calls his name. You owe him a total of 4 shirts so far, Nojiko! And yes that's -shirts-, not -shorts- you crazy people. Thankfully. @.@; When she comes over to him to bother him she gets a cold stare and then a *grunt* before he turns away from the lavender haired sister to rest his arms on the rail with his shoulders hunched up. ""Go inside and ask your maniac."" He doesn't want to let all his irritation get the better of him and start cursing at her too. Then he'd really get it!



It's a rare moment that Nami would be in agreement with Zoro. She doesn't trust Knives either. Especially not around her sister. Fortunately there was a lot more distracting her from being angry over the whole situation. It's nothing she can do anything about, with people as stubborn as them. So she grins and bears it.
 
Only she's grinning about as much as a Cheshire cat right now. o O ( .. god is this what it's like to feel like Luffy? ) ...
 
She shudders. "".... I think I ..need a nap."" And after that.. food. If she can keep it down. Stupid catnip. ... where /is/ that ball anyway? Ah! There it is. Stuffing the ball into her pocket, she skitters towards the other side of the ship. No cat in her right mind would go within twenty feet of Zoro right now and she's sure she stashed a dead bird in that tree somewhere. 
 
Dead bird?
 
Nami shakes her head, pulling herself up onto the branch. o O ( Think I'm gonna be /sick/. I feel like i've been eating birds all morning. ) .... *urp* @.x



""Nami?"" Nojiko blinks, her expression undeniably worried as she watches her sister for a moment. What's up with her! She must've slept through something really big, which isn't like Nojiko under normal circumstances. But when was the last time anything was 'normal' aboard the Going Merry -- if ever. She steps over to Nami, crouching down beside her and attempting to lightly place a hand against her side. ""Are you alright? Want me to get you some water?"" She murmurs, thinking her sister must be drunk. What else could explain her behavior! Only...something does smell pretty nice...
 
Blink. Her attention returns to Zoro, frowning as she tries to figure out his words. ""Ne, you're not making much sense either..."" Her maniac? Who the hell could that -- Noji's eyes widen as she stands up straight again. It can't be him...can it? Only one way to find out! Nojiko hurries over to the first door, opening it and prepared to search the whole ship if need be.

<lj-cut text=""Part II"">


Luffy continues to stare, crouched, out from the lower part of the open door, blinking wide-eyed.  There are a few frustrated changes in expression--confusion, concentration, decisive determination--and then there goes the straw-hatted and now freshly-bandaged pirate, creeping across the deck, right past Nojiko and Nami--who doesn't seem to be feeling so well--and makes a bee-line for Zoro.

Okay, so if he can't -explain- the situation because of complexity or ignorance, he knows action speaks louder than any word (except perhaps 'nakama').

Zoro may or may not be surprised to find a rubber pirate has latched to his legs, namely by wrapping arms around his knees and pushing his head against his pantsleg, frowning intently.  ""Nnnnnh.""  Yep.  That'd be the drawn-out, unhappy noise he occasionally makes when a situation isn't one he likes, but is pushing on ahead anyway because that's all he can think to do.

Hopefully, Zoro doesn't get too mad at him, because all he does is cling there for a moment before sidling away to climb up to the figurehead of the Going Merry and sit there.



Zoro glances over his shoulder as Nojiko runs off in search of Knives. *hrmph* He hopes that girl doesn't make any stupid decisions, but if she does they're her stupid decisions to make. Even if these people are his nakama he won't stand in their way if he can help it. Though he doesn't want to see Nojiko get hurt either and that makes doing nothing a very difficult thing. When luffy heads right for him and grabs his legs he blinks and looks down, then lifts both arms and leans back at the waist. ""OI! Get off me!"" He lifts his leg and shakes it to try and rattle the rubber boy off him. It's a good thing he goes on his own or Zoro might've stomped on him too! Once he's sitting up on Merry there's a slight frown on the face of the swordsman who hunches his shoulders up again and leans back against the rail. It's not as if he enjoys this. He hates being this angry at Luffy. That idiot is supposed to be his best friend... right?


Nojiko just...continues looking for the maniac.



Knives' unwilling patient is escaping, and he does absolutely nothing to prevent it. He certainly doesn't follow in favor of standing in the doorway of the storage room, arms crossed over his chest, bloody rag still held in one hand to watch and make damn sure nobody raises a hand to hurt the spaced-out, scatterbrained Pirate. There is no maniac here. Nojiko might have to check an asylum for one of those.



Zoro continues standing where he is. He can't see Knives in the cabin but if he could he'd be sure to glare at him some more. c_c; If Nojiko is gone too long he'll try to send in a search party. Seeing as Nami won't be much help he'll probably end up doing it himself. *mutter*



Nojiko doesn't have to look very hard at least, pausing to blink at Luffy as he makes his way across the deck and to Zoro, then up to his favorite perching spot. She blinks before turning her head, spotting the Plant standing in the doorway. ""You really are here..."" She murmurs to herself, taking a step closer. She never thought she'd see the day when he was actually on board the Going Merry again, for various reasons. Noji glances back over her shoulder, eyes instinctively narrowing on Luffy before attention returns to Knives once more. ""Is it really Luffy or..."" She trails off, letting him fill in the blank. Because if it isn't Luffy, the /real/ Luffy, Nojiko's gonna be tempted to knock him into the ocean. c.c; Hey, he hurt her sister!



Don't think Knives is particularly happy to be here, surrounding himself with hostiles for no reason better than friendship. It was a chafing enough idea as it was. At least he, unlike Luffy, isn't wearing a ton of bandages nor seems physically injured. ""Yes."" It's really Luffy. ""...What's left of him, anyway."" He was already growing accustomed to Luffy's periods of unresponsiveness. Eventually he'll snap out of it. ""I couldn't kill the parasite, but it's not there anymore, for now. I lost track of it when it fled."" Admitting failure? Maybe.



Nojiko sighs softly in relief, though that 'what's left of him' comment understandably keeps her a little worried. Her gaze travels to the bloody rag Knives is holding, then subtly dances over him for any obvious signs of injury. It must be Luffy's then. Not that that's in any way a good thing. She wishes it didn't have to be either, but it was obvious that something had to be done. And still a better alternative that what she herself had wanted to do when she just thought Luffy had lost his mind and was suddenly taking pleasure in hurting the nakama who trusted him so much.
 
There's some soft laughter as she studies the bandaged captain for another moment. ""You really..."" The laughter grows a little until she's able to catch enough breath to continue. ""You really make a terrible nurse."" If he's the one who did the bandaging at least. But she hardly expects him to be a pro at that. Noji continues laughing, both hands reaching up to cover her face and hide her expression for a moment. Who knows what it really was before her hands lower to her side once more. ""Did he remember to thank you?"" As if Luffy were a child or something. c.c;



The bandages would hold. The LAST time he bound that pirate's wounds, it had been life or death and he'd used his own ripped up cloak to do it. Knives bristles a bit when he's actually laughed at for it, a thin scowl crossiing his features. What, did she expect him to be a master medic when he spent most of his time shredding people instead? He was a killer, not a healer! ""Yes, well, it never hurts to make do with what's available,"" he growls. ""He'll live, whether or not he's got a few knots here and there, and that's the important part, right?"" Of course it was.

At least his hostility isn't even mostly her fault. He's tempermental to begin with, and putting on top of that one hell of a backlash migrane and general exhaustion? That it's only irritation he's showing is a minor miracle. ""...No. I don't expect him to. He's not ... coherent enough to think about anything for that long right now.""



""Hm,"" comes a quiet noise somewhere farther down the deck from Knives and Nojiko. ""From someone who'd just -won-, you'd think you'd be in a better mood, Arlen."" Looks like everyone's (least) favorite priest of Griffin Vulture has shown up again on the Going Merry. ...everyone cheer!



More visitors? Zoro quirks a brow at the new guy who shows up. Where are all these people coming from! And who are they! Argh, he's so uninformed! @.@; Well nothing he's going to say or do about it now, so he'll just quietly observe and make sure Nojiko doesn't get into any trouble.



""...Thank you."" Nojiko will do it on Luffy's behalf, on everyone's behalf, because she knows the rest of the nakama would probably rather die themselves than show the Plant gratitude. And with good reason really, considering the things he's done and said to them. Sometimes Nojiko feels like she's the only one who sees another side to him. She can't hold back a sigh at the thought, the shallow breath escaping her before she hears a new and familiar voice. Least favorite priest? It brings a smile to Nojiko's lips. ""For him, this -is- a good mood!"" Nojiko chuckles softly, checking to make sure Knives doesn't bristle too much at her teasing before turning to greet Albedo. ""Oi, decide to take me up on that beer? There probably isn't any now since Zoro's awake."" ...She really has a way with potentially pissing off dangerous guys. o.o; Everyone needs a hobby!



It doesn't help Nojiko and Luffy any that Knives determinedly only shows everyone else his nastier side. He had that much in common with the Darkened version of the pirate captain; he still thinks friendship is a weakness. The fewer people know it's a weakness he has, the better. His irritation is somewhat mollified by a thanks, at least, and the Plant simply shrugs, no matter how pleased he might REALLY be. ""It was nothing."" Really. And then Albedo shows up, and Knives gets to scowl at someone ELSE. ""It's not much of a victory, is it? He's still missing most of his soul, and I couldn't kill that ... /thing/."" He makes a brief grabbing motion at the air with his hands, eyes narrowed. Couldn't kill it. Wanted to. Sigh. ""Least he's alive."" Hey, he has good moods sometimes! ""You two go out for beers often?"" No, he is definitely NOT bristling again. He can control his reactions enough most of the time. Zoro's standing around not bothering to come over and find out who's who and what's going on doesn't really affect Knives much. The less swordsman there is, the better!



Albedo, much like the cats he shares those secretive smiles of his with, is good at sneaking into places where he shouldn't belong. It's a trick honed over long years of exploring, hiding, and outright sabotage--and one he'll probably never unlearn. He chuckles at Nojiko's offer, strolling across the deck (once invited, always a guest?) to join the other two. Zoro is paid a watchful purple-eyed glance that probably sees more of the swordsman than it lets on, before the pale-haired man turns his attention back to the two before him. ""Celebrate what you can, while you can,"" he chastizes, tone deliberately teasing. ""I swear, you mortal sorts take life much too seriously. Laugh a little when you win; it's good for you. Extra dopamine.""

He glances between Plant and woman once more as Knives asks his question, empathy picking up more than what words might say. Let's see--antagonize Knives again, or-- ""No,"" the priest replies truthfully. ""I missed out on the last chance for, hm, more important business at home. So what about you? Go out with her often for beers?"" Alcohol's not his vice, anyway. Oh sweet nicotine.



Did someone say something about cats? There's a statue below deck that would probably have a fondness for Albedo. But that's a different story, and he's right about laughing a little when you win. Take a break from the next problem that'll inevitably roll your way. Nojiko smiles a little bit when she sees that Albedo doesn't take the chance to antagonize Knives. She'll resist the urge himself, since the Plant's probably had a rough day and actually did a good deed for them. ""I just offered him one last time he was here, that's all. When he was delivering a little message."" She looks directly at Knives with those words, gaze heavy on him in a 'if you know what I mean' sort of way. Albedo's question earns an abrupt laugh from Noji though. ""No, he doesn't. He prefers dates that include a lot of rope and butcher shop tables."" Eheh. She's never going to let him live that down.



""I don't like alchohol."" It makes him act like his brother, namely, in a rather humiliatingly silly fashion. Going out for beers is therefore not an option! And the less he speaks about a certain incident in the tavern in drinking the entire crew of the Stalking Horse under the table, the better. And for that matter, the rare shared bottle of booze with Nojiko. The heavy stare is returned with a blank look; he really has no idea what messages got delivered, he certainly never sent anyone! Which might be the problem. Knives scrubs his face with one hand when Nojiko mentions the butcher shop incident to hide the flustered indignation that flares immediately. That wasn't a date! ""I didn't hear you complaining much,"" he points out. Course it's hard to complain when you're /gagged/, but that's the POINT. ""In fact, if I recall /correctly/, you had so few complaints you decided the distance from table to table was too far and jumped on me."" And scratched up his chest to hell and back. Insinuations are terrible things.



""My,"" Albedo says, in the uncomfortable silence that undoubtedly follows two such declarations. ""You two are getting busier than I thought."" A quiet pause, before he arches one white brow, a twitch of a typical (but much rarer, these days) perverted grin on his lips. ""Can I watch next time? That sounds like my kind of date.""



She certainly hopes it wasn't! A date, that is. Nojiko snorts, crossing her arms over her chest. And yes, she would be very quick to point out that she couldn't exactly complain at the time, and probably wouldn't have anyway -- at least not until she figured out she wasn't about to become that night's dinner for him. Noji really thought he'd lost it! Especially with the darkened Luffy's accusations still fresh in her mind. When Knives brings up her jumping him, it's suddenly Nojiko's turn to look flustered. ""That's only because you admitted you still had feelings for me!"" Did she yell that loud enough? Did all of Bluefinger hear it? Maybe she should try again. ""I'd already given up on...on..."" What Albedo told her actually. ""Besides, I don't know what I was thinking really."" She wouldn't normally do something like that anyway. At that moment she'd just felt strangely....predatory.
 
Wait. They have witnesses. And that's when the silence falls that allows Albedo to speak. Noji's lips part, trying to break the spell of speechlessness to come up with a response for Albedo. ""Maybe."" She finally manages with a soft smirk of her own. ""Because I do intend on repaying that little favor."" And just so she knows she'll make Nami proud. ""But it might cost you.""



Victory! Embarassment for embarassment, and now they're even. Don't think anything of the horribly smug look that crosses Knives' face, it means nothing. And his smugness just gets worse in the silence that follows, though curiosity nags. Had he succeeded, for however long, to convince Nojiko that she'd be better off without him around? He was glad still that he'd been forced to return, but the causes that drove him to leave to begin with were still there. He was still going to cause so many problems. ""..If you come watch,"" Knives says pleasantly, ""You'll have to be tied up and gagged too."" Which could mean anything. ""And the Navigator will be setting the prices for tickets."" Which means they'll be insanely high. A slow breath, and the momentary amusement and smugness dissapears beneath neutrality again, a glance cast towards the front of the ship where Luffy sat. ""Don't suppose either of you know how to hurry a soul's regeneration? The less time I have to spend onboard the better. I'd rather not find someone's sword in my throat while I sleep.""

Apparently Knives hasn't decided that his work here is done yet. This might cause problems.



The appreciative chuckle Knives's threat garners implies that Albedo would very -much- enjoy being tied up and gagged. The laugh fades quickly, though, amusement absorbed into his usual small, knowing smile. One that seems far, far more tired than a man that young has any right to be. ""I might,"" he ventures. ""Be able to try. I have a friend accomplished in the field."" A flutter of clawed hands emphasizes this. ""But for the life of me I don't know where he's gotten off to.""

The priest lapses into complete silence after a moment, worry swamping the amusement in his dark eyes. Damn it--there's something -here-, a snarl in the threads that weave between people, but he can't put a finger on it and he can't put words to it, and it bothers him. So he keeps silent for now.



""Well, if the two of you stay onboard overnight, you'll have to bunk together."" And wouldn't that be fun! A boy's slumber party... Noji might even be tempted to make s'mores for them. She herself is feeling a need for another one of those naps she's been taking more and more, and turns to head towards the women's quarters. Luffy's back...in part. No one died. That's good enough for her right now. Sooner or later she will have to wake up enough to get started on some of the shirts she owes Zoro. She knows the swordsman only slinks around like a guard dog sometimes because he worries about her and/or her sister. ""I'll keep you updated on the date situation Albedo!"" What date situation? Just something else for Knives to roll around in his head and try to figure out. Eh, it's late, it's the best Nojiko can do! ""Night."" She yawns, disappearing through a door and going deeper into the Going Merry.



""Date situation?"" That'll take some figuring out, yes, but he doesn't bother to say goodnight when Nojiko leaves and Zoro likewise vanishes, isntead picking his way carefully to the upper deck to plunk down where Luffy, still and silent, remained seated on the sheep's head. It was too bad the person Albedo knew who could help wasn't around. ""I'll give it one day before someone attacks me,"" he says blandly before flopping over onto his back with a pained grunt. ""Or less. If you ever find that guy, I'd appreciate it if you send him over this way.""



Albedo watches Nojiko depart with unusual sobriety, though the ""date"" comment wins another smile out of him. He smiles easy; it's his way of dealing with the world at large. So far, it's mostly worked. His attention flicks away from the disappearing woman to Knives, his expression smoothing out once again--before he moves to join the Plant on the upper deck, not even footsteps giving away his motions.

""He'd probably tell me in thirty words or more that I'm supposed to figure it out myself, or leave him alone to heal,"" the retrovirus remarks, taking a seat beside Knives. ""He has a problem with taking definite action. Or saying anything clearly."" He stretches, before snorting quietly. ""Still, he's got his uses. And if someone does, I may have to send him,"" ah, yes, he pinpointed -just- the person Knives has got the most problems with; handy, ravelling, ""to have a chat with his god about how you -treat- someone who does you a good turn.""

There's another of those long uncomfortable pauses before Albedo takes a breath and...says nothing whatsoever. Which is unusual for him, but sometimes even he runs out of words, like right now.



Knives is aware when Albedo moves anyway; it's hard to sneak up on a Plant. Still, if there's anyone Knives can enjoy perfectly peaceful space with, it's the Priest of Griffin Vulture. He can stilll detect Nojiko on the periphery of his senses, and keeps an idle tab on her location just in case. ""Ah?"" Pardon him if he doesn't get up. He's still feeling drained on more than one level. ""Which god is that?"" He'll hazard a guess given the description. ""Phoenix?"" 

He isn't aware that Albedo can detect relationships between people. Who knows whether or not he'd have trouble with it if he did.



""Killdeer,"" Albedo replies, absently. ""And he's not the one I meant, anyway."" The priest lapses back into silence, lacing his fingers together in front of him. He doesn't seem to mind that the Plant's conked out on the deck--certainly the retrovirus has been that tired in the past. ""He has the--least knots of anyone I've seen.""



The Plant's awake and coherent enough to hold conversation. And puzzle, somewhat disconnectedly, over who Albedo meant if it wasn't this stranger he didn't know. ""Who did you mean?"" He's not sure, though he comes up with a few different answers. Possibly himself being among them. Knives knows he isn't as thankful as he should be very often. ""...Knots?""



""The green-haired guy. I'd say he was a Realian if I didn't know better; God only knows only they came in such unnatural colors."" Albedo then breaks off, glancing over at Knives's inquiry of ""knots?"" and inwardly flinching. Just a little. Damn him and his thinking out loud. He looks away again and makes a noncommital noise in the back of his throat.

""Knots. People have--these threads--they look like threads, anyway. Something like that. Sometimes they get all snarled up into knots--sometimes the only way to get rid of the knots is to,"" he gestures, uncomfortably, ""cut the threads leading into them. The idea,"" his voice is somber now, ""would be to free them without hurting most of them.""



""Zoro. Their swordsman. I killed him once."" Which might explain the hostility. Nothing like bringing a gun to a swordfight. Knives had no particular remorse for this action, and doesn't bother to pretend any. As far as he cared, Zoro got what he deserved. Perhaps it's unsurprising that the crew hated him, with that sort of an attitude. The explanation of knots leaves the Plant somewhat baffled, so he doesn't respond at first in favor of letting his mind wander while he thinks about it. Sometimes the only time he found answers was when he slipped into the abstract the Sisters preferred. ""..Ah."" And now it's his time to wince. Hadn't he been trying to sever a few 'knots' of his own, in the most violent ways possible? ""How ...do you pick up on those threads?""



""I don't. It's more like they pick me up."" A rueful note in the priest's voice. ""Or--that's not right. I don't have to look for them--they're simply there. The more I know a person, the more I see--ah--"" Albedo turns to regard Knives, before tapping the Plant on the chest with a single clawed finger. ""Right there. Or almost there. One long thread running out to where your brother should be. And--"" He raises his hand, eyes following something unseen, like a cat stalking shadows. ""Another dimmer one to Nojiko. If she weren't so close by, I don't know if I'd see that one."" He points, where the thread should be. Of course, there's nothing there for anyone except Albedo.



Knives had thirteen decades to make the thread to his brother. In comparison, Nojiko hadn't been there for a fraction of the time. It didn't affect how he felt much. Knives watches Albedo move, but doesn't see the threads he does. ""...What affects their brightness or dimness? How many do people normally have? What causes them?"" Poor Albedo. But a Plant's curiosity is nothing to be teased lightly, catlike perhaps in that respect.



It's nothing Albedo would mind--if anything, his frustration is from his own inability to verbalize exactly what he sees, the intuitive understanding of the threads. Which is why he sits back, purple eyes distant, before giving a shrug and an irritation-laced laugh. ""I don't know."" Just that--he doesn't know.



""Well, guess."" Don't think he'll give up that easily. ""I don't need exact, just..what have you seen?"" Knives stares up at the sky with a thoughtful sort of blankness. ""If you can't tell me, show me.""



""Are you -sure- about that?"" Albedo inquires. But for all the amusement behind it, the question is serious--they'd talked mind to mind before, but -showing- Knives what he saw would be a little more intimate than that, and with Albedo's mind being what it is, potentially dangerous.



Knives slings one arm over his eyes and grunts. ""Sure. Can't be worse than speaking with a Sister. I want to know."" Curiosity killd the cat, right? And it isn't like Knives himself can actually do much harm, not while still suffering from the damage the parasite did. Still, he's willing enough to give it a try.



If Knives's mind isn't too fried from the parasite's depredations, he might notice the weary amusement from Albedo, in the absence of another laugh. Always something funny... He holds out his hand in mute command to the Plant; his particular abilities often work better through physical contact. ""Hand,"" he says, after a moment, then corrects himself to: ""Give me your hand.""



He was better off than the parasite, at least. And wouldn't dare try anything psionics related with someone he didn't trust right now. ""Mh?"" Hand? Oh. Knives is ... extremely loathe to get up, and thus doesn't bother in favor of offering the hand closer to Albedo, fuzzily amused.



Albedo mutely takes the Plant's hand, not bothering with formalities and niceties. Knives wanted to see, so here: Exactly how Albedo sees the world through his raveller's senses, those lines that weren't all seen, but felted and tasted and heard as well, detected imperceptible but there between almost every intelligent living thing and those they were related to, by blood or by emotions or by what some might call fate.



All in all it's a very good thing Knives is lying down right now, as he's shown directly what Albedo sees. It's ..extremely disorienting, but the Plant finds it absolutely facinating. Which is really to be expected. He just blinks quietly for a moment, curiosity threatening to overwhelm all else. ""...Neat."" And kind of painful to abraded senses, but very cool nonetheless. It reminded him vaguely of cobwebs, strung out everywhere.



The URTV lets go of the Plant's hand after a moment and snorts. ""'Neat,' he says. 'Neat.' You go through life like that with everyone calling you mad whenever you try to tell them what you see and tell me just how 'neat' it is."" The bitter words escape before Albedo can really bite his tongue and swallow them--but once they're said, typically, he doesn't even consider taking them back. It's true, too; behind all those cobwebs there seems to be some kind of hopeless darkness, and the threads are so tiny. Wherever they knot, like the complicated tangle between Knives and Luffy's nakama, the holes in the web are ripped wider and the Abyss begins leaking in... ""Just tell me how -neat- it is,"" he mumbles to himself, covering his face with a hand.



""I want to slaughter the entirety of the human race,"" says Knives, as his vision goes all skewed again and senses reorganize themselves neatly. ""I've been called mad longer than you've been alive."" Albedo forgets as often as Knives does that he's speaking to someone who well understands what it's like to be rejected by society. ""It's still neat."" Knives' eyes glaze over slowly. ""Very much so. The ... webs, the shadowy spaces. Almost .. but not quite like hyperstrings. I can't see those either but my Sisters can. It's ....facinating, really..""



""So long as someone enjoys it."" Albedo straightens up, tucking his knees up near his chest and folding his arms atop them. More words bubble to mind--scorn, accusations, arrogant proclamations that he's seen and felt more than Knives ever has, that these spiderweb strings and their knots are something he doesn't -want- to see, but that would be both ungrateful and lying. It just sometimes feels so -good- to uncrate all of those worries and pent-up rage on the unsuspecting.

Knives deserves better. ""Fascinating is one way to put it.""



They could get into a pissing contest over who's had it worse and it'd never end. Both had been through horrific things, and that was that. A lifetime of misery doesn't keep Knives' eyes from glazing over the rest of the way, or keep his pupils from dilating to the point where his eyes seem black but for a thin ring of ice blue. ""What's the point in not enjoying it? Disliking it won't make it go away, so enjoy it."" He waves one hand vaguely. ""I'd take it off your hands if I could. It's ... very interesting..""



""...Everyone left?""

This time, that's another voice near where the Plant and URTV have decided to remain, from the pirate seated on the head of the figurepiece of the Going Merry, who has abruptly become vocal after a very long time spent simply sitting motionless, staring at the rest of the docks as night falls.

Luffy lifts his head and glances a little over his shoulder, blinking slowly.

""...Albino-ossan.""  He wants to ask 'Why are you here?' and 'What are you two talking about knots for?' but again, words are something that are getting tangled up in knots of their own; the way his meager spirit is trying to deal with all this empty space inside is making even basic communication difficult.  But at least he's alive.

Instead, he only gives them a quiet, innocently puzzled look.



Thank the little gods that they've got Luffy here to interrupt before they can get into just such a pissing contest. Albedo is quick as ever to leap on the opportunity, discarding the momentary melancholy (and frustrated anger) in favor of the commedia mask. Gently, though, gently. ""They're still around, but yes, it's just us two abovedecks."" Well, he did say he'd try to do something about those gaping holes in Luffy's soul.

He gets up off the deck lithe as a cat uncurling from a nap in the sun, pacing over to the rubber pirate. His inspection of the other priest is more than merely visual--it would stand to reason that a priest of the god of death would know a great deal about souls, their injuries, and how to repair them. ""Mmm. And you've got more holes in you than swiss cheese,"" he finally mumbles, to himself. ""Or an unlucky Gnosis in the sights of--ahh, forget it.""



The Plant remains spaced out. He's still paying attention, but he really ... REALLY doesn't look it. ""Yo."" Welcome back, traveller. Still lost? ""They went to sleep."" Mostly. He could if he focused a bit find each one of them, where they were in relation to him. Most were asleep or getting that way. It simply meant Knives could have some piece for a while. His gaze tracks Albedo but doesn't seem to actually focus on him that much. ""When I cut it away, there was ..so little left."" He sounds genuinely apologetic, and not a little ashamed.



At first, the pirate is blinking at Albedo, uncomprehending, and Knives' greeting draws his eye.  Luffy takes again a little more time than necessary to process this, as if he were listening from some great distance, already his stare is starting to stray inward, but this time he makes a concerted effort to focus.  They went to sleep.  ""Aa.""  If they went to sleep, maybe they aren't so worried after all.

""Ii zo."" he says presently, and only belatedly realizes Albedo's hopped up to where he is, and Luffy gives him a look like he hadn't expected this at all.  ""...Holes.""  He's just parroting while the rest of his thoughts catch up in slow motion.  ""......I forget what I'm sitting here for,"" he points out blankly, pointing down at the head.  ""Why are you looking at me like that?""  See?  The more lucid he is, the more he talks.  But at least he's talking!



Albedo's instant and somewhat annoyed impulse is to just give up, or possibly attempt to solve this problem with violence. His way of dealing with this is to smile just a little wider, a smile with a great deal of weariness behind it. ""Well, that makes two of us--I don't know why you're sitting here, either. Here,"" he offers a hand, a gesture that has far more portent than just giving the captain of the Straw-Hat Pirates an unneeded assist down, ""it's probably best if you get your sleep as well."" An absent thought is sent Knives's way, ++ Such things happen. You have to cut out a lot of tissue to get an ulcer out. ++



""You always sit there,"" is the vague mumble from Knives, who tries mightily to actually get up. He fails, and lies there for a bit more before slowly rolling onto his side, and from there carefully levering himself up onto his feet. ""And he's right. Sleep is good. I'll make you breakfast."" Hunt down breakfast is probably more accurate. Would it be safe enough for Luffy to go to his usual sleeping place? ++ Ah, still. ++ Knives won't be leaving, just in case. In case that parasite came back. In case someone attacked Luffy while the captain was unable to think for long. ""Come on. Storage room will have to do."" He's pretty sure that he can dig up enough stuff for Luffy to sleep on.



Whenever someone holds something out to a person, the first trained reaction is to take it.  Luffy puts his hand on Albedo's offered one without thinking, though only as long as it takes to stand up (he wavers once, with a mumble about food) and lets go as he steps down.  Doubtlessly, an empath as powerful as Albedo will glean what he can even with such a brief contact.  You always sit there.  ""...Mm.""  That's right, he does.  Breakfast?  That's as good a reason to sleep as any.  It'll pass the time before food.  ""Mmkay.""

He follows, and stops at the door to the storage room.  ""...Thanks.""  It won't come back with you here.  That's something he'd also like to say, but the words are being capricious with utterances.


Indeed, that ephemeral contact is all that Albedo needs to trace parts of Luffy's soul back to their source. It's not the empathy so much as those same cobwebs he was showing Knives before--a literal rope back to the Ruined Crescent, something the URTV can see burned on the inside of his eyelids when he closes them. No--this is a little beyond what meager abilities he has to repair spirits, but--as he releases Luffy's hand--there's no reason to say that now, tonight. The Plant and the Gum-Gum Man (or what's left of him, is the morbid little addendum) can go get themselves bedded down. Albedo, by the tired salute he tosses Knives, will stay up here in his own silences and mull on this.


Let Knives stay paranoid. It'll be his fuel and feed in order to keep watch and make sure something doesn't go wrong. The shadow of gray on the docks marks Desimir likewise keeping watch, but more for irate pirates /not/ of the ship than part of it. What do you say to a thanks you're not sure you deserve? Nothing at all past a ghost of a smile. And return the tired salute to Albedo before herding his somewhat torpid friend indoors. He'll find -something- to put Luffy on for a while to see if the man will sleep. ++ Desimir caught dinner for you if you're hungry. He says it's .. venison? ++ Grays are not carnivores, and Knives is not hungry. Perhaps Albedo can make work of it. But for now ... he's going to try to relax.



Sleep. Well, it'll elude both Plant and pirate tonight, but not for any of the usual suspected reasons. Luffy simply can't, but that's fine; he'll be sitting still the whole night through, staring at nothing, saying nothing but the occasional, subvocal utterance. It's more of the same. Knives won't in spite of his fatigue, a self-assigned sentry against a return of the same thing that had caused all this trouble to begin with.

Who knows? Perhaps this puzzle will have sleep playing an evasive mistress for Albedo as well. If it's one thing night is good for, it's quiet hours to think in."

<lj-cut text=""I am your friend."">

The warehouse on the far end of the docks.

That armored guy.  He already left, carrying his broken and bleeding brother away in his arms in search of a doctor.  These wounds aren't so bad the pirate couldn't just get up and finish the job, and yet he's still lying there on the debris strewn ground, surrounded by blood-tipped spikes, lying where Edward had, when he pulled the port of his shoulder open.

""......""

There is nothing stopping him.  Except, perhaps, himself.  That sliver of his host's spirit was strong enough to have had his fill of this and exert some small amount of control with that word the Darkened soul so hated: Nakama.

Instead, he can do little more than try to wrestle himself for control of limbs leaking blood.  The effort leaves fingers twitching restlessly on the ground, eyes narrowing and widening as the only sign of a struggle that has no other outward evidence.

No one would investigate for a while, yet.  There were some who had become afraid of what he had become.  People usually didn't go out of their way to investigate a trail of blood in a pirate town.

""Nakama... ka."" Teeth are bared in restrained rage.  Nakama.  Always.  Nakama.  ""I'll kill them all, eventually.  Give it up.""



Blood and distress call to some predators, and while those of Bluefinger are quick to avoid the trouble that came from the area Luffy had fought at, Knives doesn't bother to resist the tug of faintly hungry curiosity. Something had happened, though he wasn't sure what, and Desimir didn't particularly know either. Which means investigating on his own, on foot, following whispers and agitated glances across the docks to a warehouse and bloodsoaked ground. The spikes aren't much of a concern, really, and he can almost, /almost/ recognize the scent of familiar blood as belonging to that annoying midget alchemist who took his Nina from him. So what if it had been willing.

Finding Luffy lying there was an interesting bonus. What an opportunity.

Most people wouldn't think of capitalizing on someone else's injuries to get what they want, but Knives isn't most people, is he? He doesn't bother to hide when he approaches that bloody, angry form, circling once like a dog around a porcupine before a slow smile crosses his face. Nakama. ((Give it up.)) So the Pirate is still there, and not just the parasite.

""Hello again, parasite. Imagine finding you here."" Nakama. Those people on the ship, hurt and terrified because of this creature's actions, Nojiko asking him if he'd kill for her and be rid of the threat. He had no nakama of his own, but that didn't mean he wouldn't interfere. As the parasite had probably long known. Knives is, if not anything else, an opportunist.




The smell of blood from his own skin infuriates him more than the pain.  The smell of blood that isn't his calls him to murder its owner.  Friend or no, he would see him die by his own hands before the day is through.  Just let him up.  Let him up and he'll destroy everything - maybe even that ship, and take another from any of the pirates docking here.  Who would stop him?  Just you.  LET. HIM. U--

""--/Knives/,"" enunciates the parasite with a tone low-voiced and poisonous, teeth bared in a grimace.  ""I should have known you'd come poking around sooner or later.""  Eyes narrow.  ""Have you forgotten already?  I'll -kill- her if you interfere!  I told you!  I'll make her suffer if--""

His eyes widen.  "".......""  In his own skull, he can hear that Hoatzin again.  And he sounds victorious.  ""You told her.  You SON OF A BITCH.""  Anger of a new kind at last wrests control over his limbs in part, but his motions are jerky and puppetlike as he pushes himself into sitting up.  ""I TOLD you not to interfere!!""



Except Knives doesn't intend to actually -allow- him up, grasping a length of rope with bouys still attached and lashing out with one foot to plant it firmly against Luffy's chest and /shove/ him back down. In the state Luffy's in right now, a physical battle is pretty unequal, isn't it? Especially since Knives fully intends to bind Luffy hand and foot tight enough to be quite painful as soon as he has the chance. ""Yesss,"" he hisses between gritted teeth. ""I told her when she came looking for help. By now she'd have told the rest, and they'll listen to her."" Make her suffer? Kill her? These are the things that will not dissuade Knives from his chosen path.

""I'm not going to suffer your presence any longer, parasite. You threaten too much, and you don't know your place."" He'd said he wouldn't kill the Pirate, but there weren't really any other options. And he fully intended to take the opportunity ka had given him to try to end this threat once and for all. Not only for Nojiko's safety, but to put the true Straw Hat captain out of what must surely be his acute misery. He couldn't imagine what it must be like, trapped and watching this. How aware is he? ""I told you before. There will be no returning from where I send you. And your time is up.""



He hasn't even the time to glance down at the pressure on his chest before Luffy's back finds the ground with a surprised cough.  Both hands come up to grasp at Knives' leg, and he gets about as far as preparing to shove his foot away when the effort only reminds him of the wounds up his arms, legs, and sides.  ""Gh--""  That was a bad idea.  With part of his strength being consumed with an irate soul fragment of his host body and Hoatzin refraining from offering his Gift to the intruder, even these injuries can keep him down.

""....""  For a long moment, the pirate doesn't move, staring.  These words would signal the crumbling of his hopes that had fueled his every action since he slipped into the dead body they pulled from the Ruined Crescent.  ""....H-hehe,"" laughs the captain, nervously.  ""So that's it, huh? Hahaha.  And I thought everything was perfect.""  His gaze skirts sideways, then another way, like he were eyeing possible exits.

And then looks down at the rope, before throwing his head back and laughing.  ""What are you gonna do?  Kill us?  I'll just come back!  I don't even know if he'll survive, there's too little of him left!""



""Yeah. Gonna kill you."" It's said pretty evenly, as if none of this really mattered, and he was just dealing with killing an animal for dinner. Not trussing up the body of one of his only friends (a friendship that may not be returned any longer, not after shooting Nami) with intentions of ripping that person apart. ""You should have gotten allies."" Knot. Even if Luffy's rubber, Knives will try to make sure everything's tight enough to prevent escape. ""People you could trust at your back willing to do anything for you. You know. Nakama."" A ghost of a smile. ""What you wanted to do couldn't be done with force alone.""

Once tied? Knives will simply sit on the rubber pirate. He knows it won't kill the man, dropping a boulder on him wouldn't, why would a mere two hundred pounds? If he kills the parasite, Luffy is quite likely to die as well. ""But you won't be coming back. And if Luffy has to die to make sure of it ... that's okay. I think, to make sure you can't come back, he'd be willing. After what you've done. How's that, sai?"" And for Luffy, who was fighting as hard as he could, and couldn't shake this thing loose. For the nakama who -couldn't- fight back, not on the level needed, not with the power that would be needed. Even then, he'd give anything to leave it in their hands and let -them- spill the blood of the man who would be pirate king, and not Knives himself. He wasn't as calm as he looked, even blue gaze masking a deep, uneasy nervousness.

Knives has never before attempted something like this, killing the mind and soul instead of the body. But if ever there was a time to try it, that would be now. ""Look at me, parasite."" Match that unwavering blue gaze and he'll strike deep, burn a link from mind to mind and lock it open.

And then the real fight will start. One he's not sure he can win.



That answer (( Yeah. Gonna kill you. )) inspires another of the pirate's nervous, unsteady laughs.   But the next: ""Sou ka."" ...That carries a note of confused relief.  That one rings a little true for what's behind the Darkened captain's manic grins and murderous actions.  ""...Sou ka.""  (( Allies. ))  And now he's letting out a growl that grows with efforts to struggle out of a newly knotted rope.  Allies.  He doesn't NEED them!  He's strong enough!  He's--

--going to lose everything he worked so hard for, because he has no one to watch his back.  ""You're one to talk about friends, Knives,"" he says instead, lowly, his head slightly bowed, watching him with wide eyes through a ragged layer of black hair.  ""Hehehe.  Right?  Come on, Knives, we've got so much in common.""  A strain that causes a fresh rivulet of blood to travel down his arm, and he lifts his head with a grimace, ""Come on!  Join me.  You don't have to do this.""

His answer is getting sat on.  The parasitic captain hisses out his breath at aggravated wounds and glares at the Plant.  .......His logic rings true, and after a stubborn moment, he turns his face away with a spat swear.  He's lost.  "".....Heheh.  You never did answer me.""

""So, why did you do it?  Why are you back?""  He looks up, saying, ""Answer me tha--""  Eyes widen.

This is no longer the grounds in front of an old warehouse due for renovation at the docks of Bluefinger Port.

It's like drowning in oil and yet not needing breath.  The world is roiling black and a thousand dirty variant shades, swimming with broken, edged thought-fragments steeped in violence, rage, fear.  There is already a connection, so finding the parasite is easy; there he is, less like a man and more like a statue obsidian, shattered and put together again in a way that doesn't quite fit, all hard, cutting edges.

And eyes that burn like balefire.  ""You're TOO LATE.  You can't remove me, I've been here too long!""  And yet fear peals like a warning siren.  He bluffs.




If the parasite had thought to keep his host's friends loyal, then there was nothing Knives could have ever done past watch and know what was going on without being able to interfere. Maybe it could have eventually won the genocidal Plant over as well, but it never had, and now the price for those errors was nigh, wasn't it? To all of Darkened Luffy's questions only go a slight, bitter smile and silence. He didn't have to answer. He had much in common with the parasite, that was true. And perhaps he could have accepted this version of Luffy easier than the one he knew best. But it was the original, and not this one, that risked his life to hunt down a murderer, and risked it again to give him a new chance and a new name. Knives hasn't forgotten. 

Why is he here? Because he wants to be.

He expects the change from reality to another version of it, but even then his revulsion is clear. It was filthy to him, this place, a vulgar, sickening maelstorm of filth and putrid garbage. Even then, Knives surveys the mind he finds himself within, shaking off metaphorical wings and flexing equally metaphorical claws thoughtfully. Nothing quite like entering the lair of the dragon directly to do battle. ""It doesn't matter. Haven't you realized that yet?"" What is Knives to the senses of the mind? What are angels? Or butterflies? Or simply men?

I want to save them both!
Isn't that a contradiction?

""I'm not here to seperate you and he. I'm here to kill you both."" Knives knew Luffy would do it for him, were their positions reversed, if there were no other way. And this time, there might not be any other way. The crew of the Going Merry would blame him when he returns with a corpse and not a living captain they know. It was acceptable. What's loved, lives. Luffy would see them all again, one day. ""You should have never threatened me or mine, parasite. Or him and his.""

A thought fragment that drifts past, oily and disgusting, is caught - and flung like a throwing knife.




The fragment, when caught, transmits only (( a sense of horror, realizing that seconds ago the loss of something dear became a fact irreversable--call it destiny, call it fate, whatever makes you sleep better at night except for the resolve to NEVER CARE AGAIN which changes nothing at all of the past )) before it's thrown, knocking a chip of black off the Darkened force's upper arm.  Both pieces scatter spinning through the darkness and cut past it like a curtain.

Beyond it, something glimmers pale.

An arm hanging loose like a corpse half out of a bodybag, flickering like a candle flame in monochrome, the host body's remaining fragment lies tangled in the darkness that has polluted the rest of this place, head down and mouth slack.

But the Darkened parasite is already throwing his razored form at the intruder.

(( And then it's the cave in the desert all over again, and an arm bandaged in strips of brown from your own cloak, you staring down the barrel of your own gun with the pirate on the other end, chewing on a bone.  Eating the marrow, because their fight had cost him plenty in blood. ))

The parasite descends, attacking.

(( But this time, he fires. ))




The last time Knives tried to fight a battle on this level, Hoatzin had ripped his mind and soul apart. This time, however, he's not fighting for himself. Perhaps for the first time. The rush of sharp edges in attack is met head-on; Knives isn't terribly concerned with being injured, believes he can't be on this level and locks blades with jagged edges in an attempt to force the lunge to a stop. He's surprised when it hurts, surprised that the mind bleeds as well as the body and drops sanguine threads into the endless black.

Endless but for a form wrapped in blackness like prey caught in a spider's web, noticed peripherally and focused on only for a moment before being processed unconciously instead in favor of shoving back even when obsidian shards slice deep (and this time, he fires), and reaching back with one metaphorical fist to drive it square into the parasite's face. Or what passes for one here. He didn't understand the horror that had been felt in that fragment, and it's easy enough for a moment - just a moment to whip free one tendril and capture another broken piece of thought and emotion.

Knives' tactics are somewhat strange, wrapping thought and self in thin layers of shields like fog, to keep any of his own thoughts from slipping free and warning the parasite of the possibilities. Of the fact that this is more or less its home territory, and could be shaped to that thing's will. ""What are you so afraid of?""

((Why are you here?))



The blow sends the Darkened one reeling back; yes, this is his home territory and can be shaped to his will, but with no experience in this sort of intrusion at all, with no psionic abilities, he's at a severe disadvantage.  The next fragment has a more subtle transmission filled only with a murderous intent--destroy everything, so there's nothing left to take advantage of a moment of weakness.  Or perhaps in revenge.  Or perhaps because it's fun.

This one catches him in the leg and stays there, sparking; the parasite screeches in pain.  It's a thought burning itself out in intensity, once activated it burns bright and hot until there's nothing left of it but the sense of something forgotten.

Only enough time has passed for the body bound beneath the Plant to gasp sharp his surprise to discover something his mind has already addressed with violence.

The obsidian parasite rights himself into a ready crouch again, hissing like a viper backed into a corner by a larger predator.  ""I won't disappear!  You can't make me!""  Everything he wanted was torn from him when he was trapped in the Ruined Crescent.  His one opportunity had been something he thought impossible: a body - his own?! - had passed through--how could he NOT take the chance when he had it?  ""You're threatening EVERYTHING!  GET OUT!"" he roars.

Beyond him, there are pale fingers twitching once in the dark.

This time, blackness tries to crawl up metaphorical legs, as if he might by will alone absorb the Plant into himself, consume another's will with his own.




And the Plant merely shakes himself off, as if this would allow him to be rid of the pain and stench of foreign mind. ""I can make you."" Solemn statement indeed, as in Bluefinger Port the gray stallion that was Knives' bondmate approaches and stands guard, to keep any others from interfering from the outside. ""This place didn't belong to you. You should never have taken it. I'm not leaving until I'm rid of you and they don't have to worry about you coming back ever again."" It seems (though it was awful to touch and experience) the shards of memory were very useful weapons against their owner, and Knives will continue to use them whenever he can grab one, like small flung blades.

I'm sorry, my friend. If I thought there were another way..

The crawling blackness is reacted to immediately with a snarl of anger, twisting to rip into it instead of focusing on the parasite like a trapped animal might, purely on instinct and with the fury of the same. Subjugating Knives and consuming him by will alone won't be any easy task at all, especially when he realizes that's the goal. One hand reaches out in a shifting of cloth to set gloveless palm against Luffy's bloody chest, in between strips of rope as on the mental level the Plant lashes back, violently and without care for what he hits with blades forged of pure outrage and pain.

He intends to kill both, after all. Why does it matter what he damages in the doing?



The palm winds up knocking the pirate onto his back where he'd been sitting somewhat upright when he caught the Plant's gaze and began this war of minds, with no more resistance physically than a puppet lacking strings.  Even though all attention, all energy is focused inward, on the physical realm he is all small twitches and nervous tics, little utterances and half-formed words.  If anyone had questions as to the captain's sanity since Ruined Crescent, a glance alone would tell them volumes of how little rationality remained.

Each fragment seems to be coalesced passions, vices, memories; all of them twisted, warped, broken, everything that defines 'Darkened' in the Game of the gods is represented here.  In the presence of a parasitic Darkened, there is no need for Luffy himself to be a Paragon - he is himself and that's enough, it seems, even for this.

To survive, anyway, in a small part.

Knives has taken steps to protect himself, but his opponent has no such knowledge or experience; destroying the tendrils causes him apparent pain, but still his attacks are clumsy, as dangerous to himself as they are to Knives.  Beyond it, though, the flickering fragment stirs, lifting his head.

(( Arlen, huh?  That's a good name. ))

This time, the voice that speaks is out in the physical, words coughed out while the battle rages on.  ""--Can't die--"" Breathe.  ""--nakama.""  He can't die, not until he's said he's sorry. 



He'd already betrayed Luffy's trust in him. Betrayed Nojiko, proved Nami right in that he was nothing more than a monster and would always be nothing more than a monster. And here he was to make the backstabbing complete and kill both without taking the chance to find some sort of a cure. It was easier. More merciful maybe. It's hard, on this level, to figure out how much damage he's doing, and how much he takes in return, but it doesn't keep him from doing whatever he can to rip this ... /thing/ apart with raw force if need be, with its own memories and feelings when necessary and whenever possible. How must it feel, to have your own memories used against you?

Luffy's murmur refocuses blue eyes only slightly, neither heeding nor noticing the steady drip of crimson from ears and nose. Desimir's low telempathic whisper is almost not quite heard either.

""Luffy?"" But in the mind, things that -aren't- this filth are noticed very quickly especially when they move enough to draw the attention. And very rapidly Knives re-evaluates the situation. That fragment shouldn't be able to focus that much, shouldn't even still -be there-, nevermind be aware of itself and the situation it's in. Nakama. Not sneered at. ""Luffy!"" He doesn't expect a response, how could there be? But if he's still alive (inasmuch as being a small shard of a soul can be), then trying other options is absolutely necessary.

He'd told Nojiko how important the pirate captain was to the crew, and why it was necessary they try to find a way to get him to survive without the parasite. He'd meant every word of it, knowing just how Luffy felt about his crew and how they felt about him. He'd thought upon coming here that there was no hope of recovery.

Maybe there was. The Plant gathers himself up as best he can and lunges like a striking serpent, with the same purpose - to sink fangs deep and coil around that jagged obsidian mockery of Monkey D. Luffy, whether or not touching was painful, like grabbing a handful of glass and squeezing. How much of that blackness can he wind into intangible coils? As much as he can pull in, as much as delicate blades can slice free from that pale familiar form. It's not really a very intelligent idea, pitting raw willpower against raw willpower in the parasite's home grounds.



Contact isn't so much directly painful as venemous, like contact alone was somehow corruptive.  This is a will that survived the Ruined Crescent for gods know how long; although his willpower wasn't enough to spare his sanity, it's enough to give Knives a struggle reminiscent of the fight between he and Hoatzin's Priest in the Desert of Lost Hope.

But a man made of broken obsidian, holding himself together on the power of his own will, can't hold himself together cohesively when it starts to waver; fragments of black start to shower away, cutting even as they loosen.

If cuts and slashes could be, each of them, a barrage of memories obscure and specific, each more bewildering and horrible than the last.  If you'll take him down, then he will visit upon you, Knives, the very hell he's experienced in his madness, all in a few scant seconds.  Screaming.

In the physical realm, Luffy utters something about feathers.

(( feathers in the dark ))  Hoatzin?  It might be what suddenly flutters in a beat of slapping wings that descends into the face of the obsidian parasite, giving Knives momentary reprieve to take advantage of how he will.  Delicate blades are as deft as his own fingers, and the flickering shard's form staggers free and falls.  The beat of wings vanishes, Hoatzin's work done.

The flickering, pale, monochromatic figure lifts his head, as if lethargic.  ""...Arlen...?""  (( Luffy? ))  ""...Why are you here?""  (( The creature is still screaming, cracking )) (( Luffy! )) ""--ARLEN!""  Even shouting, the fragment's voice sounds so far away.  ""ARLEN?!?""  Once freed, why would he simply stand back and do nothing while his friend pits his will against the thing that had imprisoned him?

Which would be why a flickering, somewhat transparent hand grabs at the jaw and throat of the parasite and PULLS back, in spite of pain.  The corruption can't possibly make things worse.




Maybe the difference this time is Knives isn't trying to escape the battle. He couldn't. He owed Luffy far more than a bit of blood, and abandoning that now was not acceptable. The Plant has his own strange brand of loyalty, and this was it. He might attempt to drive them away, but when push comes to shove he knows which side he'll be shoving /from/. Luffy had been there when Knives had nowhere else to go and nobody else to turn to, returning the favor simply made sense.

And holding on to try to help someone else seemed better somehow than doing it just for himself. Hadn't these Pirates, with their stupid, foolish dreams proven that? So Knives will simply buckle down as best he can to try to endure the hurricane of foreign pain, foreign horror and rage that cut like a thousand poisoned blades. And torn into by shards that shatter away as well as the ones tightly wrapped around, he bleeds. One beesting won't do much, but a thousand can kill, and his strength is not endless despite his experience. He pulls up all the strength he -has- to simply hold on and not let go against it.

The thunder of wings is horrifyingly familiar, and Knives flinches away from it without quite releasing his hold on the parasite, taking the moment's distraction to shift his grip and fasten knifelike fangs elsewhere and bite deep again, the flavor countless years of futile rage and hatred. Why is he here? Blue eyes glaze over slowly with that thought. Why is he here? Let the creature scream. ""You are my friend."" Reason enough.

More than reason enough. A brief reach, to catch hold of and gather more of that poisonous darkness to himself, and constrict further, tighten down no matter how hard it is when the parasite is attacked by another that Knives desperately hopes will /survive/ all of this. He doesn't know if he himself will.

It's not a concern. There's only so much Knives can multitask with his energy rapidly waning, but he'll try to inflict those same diaphanous shields on Luffy, to draw the corruption that comes from even -touching- away. The less the Pirate has to deal with, the better his chances of getting away alive.



Luffy had believed in Knives when no one else did.  Which is why the supposed betrayal when Knives was trying to distance himself to spare his nakama pain had stung Luffy so deeply.  But then there are things like Knives being -here- doing what he can because it's come to this.  There are things like (( You are my friend. )) what he's saying that has a revelation springing forward as if to say, See?  And you doubted.  See?  Friendship is the same even if actions taken in the name of it vary greatly from person to person.  See?  He was there all along.

In the physical realm, the pirate continues to stare sightlessly as if in surprise, until he gives him a strained smile.  ""Sou ka.""  Neither of them can observe a shed tear, and that's just as well.  ""Yokatta.""  Even if they don't speak the same language all the time, the gratitude is sincere.

His efforts to extend shielding to the fragment don't go unrewarded; it spares Luffy much when the Darkened parasite finally comes to a decision and throws the fragment off in his efforts to escape.

Yes, escape.  His greatest fear is to disappear, to simply fade away.  He sure as hell won't stubbornly cling to a body that's found a guardian against possession at the risk of his own existance.  So instead of fighting back, he sets his efforts to FLEE.  To leave this body and take every sign of his presence with him.

The fragment isn't strong alone, and only sits where he was knocked back with a bewildered, awe-struck stare.  

The darkness is starting to stir, withdraw.




Knives still thought it was stupid, risking this much for a mere human, one who wasn't even particularly smart or a servant. What was Luffy, past an emotional attachment? But even knowing this, he's still fighting as tenaciously as he /can/ to try to keep that one spider alive longer. It really didn't make any sense, but what DID make logical sense, when dealing with Hoatzin's priest? Not very much.

But as the focus of the battle changes and the parasite attempts to escape, there comes a decision to be made. He was strong enough for the moment, though that strength was flagging, to prevent the invader from escaping, nail it down and kill it once and for all, but that would mean dropping his own shields, dropping the ones protecting Luffy, and hoping it doesn't take advantage of having its opponents entirely defenseless. If he lets go, then he can focus on trying to keep that shard of the true Luffy from dissapearing, and both would live to try again another day. Throughout this consideration, Knives holds on tight even as the parasite struggles in its efforts to escape, thoughtful and silent despite the pain and poison.

What would be better? Possibly die to eliminate a threat, or come back more prepared later, give the flickering presence a chance to make amends for everything that had happened? Would it be more merciful to simply strike now?

((They're my nakama.))

((I'll find a way to fix this. Don't worry.))

As suddenly as he had struck, the Plant lets go, shaking himself free of the cloying oily darkness as well before resuming his assault, this time in a considerably different manner. It's not entirely unlike having a wolf snapping at the heels of your horse as you ride, the promise of what will happen if those teeth close on flesh and bone instead of air enough of an incentive to flee a little faster.




What -was- he?  Only the guy who thought he was kind of strange before he started killing nakama, only the guy he hunted down through the wilds of the Dream until he found him in the Desert of Lost Hope.  Only the guy who almost couldn't win, until he realized it wasn't about winning this fight or avenging his nakama, but about respecting the memory of his nakama enough to give someone another stab at life, by transferring to another the ability to DREAM and have a life of their own, bound by no destiny or fate imposed on them by the past.

If Knives attracts the surreal in the way his brother does, is it no surprise that Hoatzin's Priest would find something in him to believe in?

It's while the Plant is considering what to do next that the flickering image sitting there stares at him, expectant and silent, and then grins at him, lifting a hand in a wordless wave.

(( Ii zo. ))

To say the flight is fast would be inadequate, but true.  It's not quite instantaneous, but with the threat of the Plant's attack on metaphorical heels, damaged and broken, every shred of influence seems to evaporate, leaving a sedate, grayspace, full of silence.

There's a lot of room in here to fill.

""....""  Except, it seems, for a small fragment that remains, light guttering like a candle in a breeze.  He's sitting, hatless, looking at transparent hands like he were surprised to find them there.  He drops his hands into his lap, lifting his head to look at the Plant.  A quick smile, and he starts to fall back.

""You're bleeding.""  That's a voice in the real.  ""You should let Chopper--"" A shallow intake of breath, and Luffy's eyes half-close while he almost seems to lose consciousness, and lies on the ground outside the warehouse, dazed.  ""............H--hara heta,"" he mutters weakly.  Figures, only Hoatzin's own will complain about being hungry at a time like this.




He has always been under the impression Luffy's head was empty, but this was rediculous. With the parasite absent, Knives doesn't withdraw immediately. It takes a moment (much less, on this level, time is relative, minutes passing in a mere flicker of an eye, hours as minutes) to catch his breath (though there's no breath here, is there?) and recenter himself, aching from a thousand intangible wounds. They'd won, for now. He wouldn't have been able to, if Luffy hadn't interfered, if Hoatzin hadn't also done what He could. Teamwork, the Plant decides .... is a strange, useful thing. Maybe he should try it again sometime. Knives doesn't bother to say he'll be gone in a minute, Luffy was already settling back in. What remained of him.

He'd read on blood expanders used on those who couldn't or wouldn't accept transfusions, methods used to stretch out what little blood there was and make it at least have the needed volume. The same principle applies to what the exhausted alien begins next, weaving a delicate webwork of energy and tossing it into the grayness before withdrawing carefully back into himself. Hollow places in the soul tend to call to unwanted things to fill in the holes and take over, so filling those holes with something else was probably a good idea. Energy would have to be enough of a placeholder for now, until that sliver of soul regenerated, or healed on its own and replaced itself.

It's a small bandaid on a very large wound, but it's all he can do.

((You're bleeding.)) Ice blue eyes refocus abrubtly, and Knives (still sitting on the Pirate; really, he should move, and he does so carefully to sit on the side instead) raises one hand he can't quite keep still to wipe at his nose. ""Nn. I'll live."" And so will Luffy, if Knives has anything to say about it, giving a short, tired laugh at the mutter about hunger. It's familiar. And that's probably the most important part.

Fingerblades sharp enough to cut steel make short work of the rope he'd tied the pirate with. No reason to have him tied up now. Getting to his feet, and taking Luffy with him in the same motion, is nauseatingly disorienting and makes the world spin around him, but it's endured for now. ""....Let's go get you some lunch."" Lunch? Dinner? Something like that. The Going Merry would be able to deal with Luffy's appetite. That too would be familiar. It would be enough for now, and Knives was satisfied."

"event","Placed in timeline after Luffy has acquired some healing at Golden Hall from the fight with Usopp, Dark Luffy attempts to sneak onboard the Going Merry... and discovers there are Alchemists looking for him.

Note: There is violence and a lot of swearing.

<lj-cut text=""Darkened Luffy vs. Elric Kyoudai."">

The ground is still soft from a heavy rainstorm that had rolled in off the sea, dumped sheets of water on Bluefinger and its surrounding area over the course of roughly thirty hours, and broke apart as it traveled further inland.

So, the ride was probably a little uncomfortable, with ruts drawn deep into the road that connected Golden Hall to Bluefinger Port, but at least the port itself is at least paved where there's still ground, and planks of wood where there isn't and only water beneath.

Beneath a gray expanse of dreary, slumbering sky, Bluefinger Port manages to bustle with life, even in a post-storm wetness lingering in the air.  It should rain again and be done with it.  Instead, it hangs there, oppressive.

In spite of things looking busy as usual, it seems people have enough time to spare more than one gawking stare at the hulking armor and his shorter companion.  There's more than a few with the time to spare for pointing and speaking amongst themselves behind hands not otherwise occupied with wares or crates, ropes or netting.

No one goes out of their way to give them trouble, however.  And finding the ship of the Straw Hat Pirates isn't difficult in the least.

""What, you got a duel with him, too?"" one grizzled man asks, before shoving a gnarled thumb back over his shoulder, towards the ram's-headpiece of the Going Merry, docked amidst other ships.

Where, it might be noted, someone is already speaking to a straw-hatted youth and pointing in the direction of the two brothers.



""Duel?"" Edward answers the man, looking at the ship --and the boy, -- over his shoulder. ""Take it this has been happening a lot, then?"" 

Edward Elric is the priest of Oilbird. He comes when someone who is a basically good person starts doing bad things. It's usually a sign that something's amiss; outside influence, some mental imbalance, and all sorts of other things can be attributed to the 'change'. Edward's not sure what this one is -- but he's pretty sure this won't end well or prettily or -- well, even successfully. He just knows there's gonna be trouble.

""Al,"" he says, to his hulking brother, ""you -- if things get ugly, if I get /really/ hurt... you're not telling Winry. Got it? She already knows this is dangerous."" So, no telling her /how/ dangerous, dammit. 

And then dock the docks, fingering he heavy weights he brought with him. Just in case, he tells him, though he feels traitorous for the thought. Just in case -- things get really ugly.

He's gonna go right up that dock, to the plank to the ship, like he owns the damn place. No one said Ed wasn't arrogant, after all. It's a /defining trait/.



""Um. Brother?"" Al looks down. ""how do we keep Winry from noticing if you get really hurt?"" The wood groans under his feet--it's good and sturdy and won't betray him. But it complains under the weight of the armor, griping and creaking. Maybe it should drop him in, it says, and see how kind the water feels to him. But oh no, no, the pier is strong and sturdy, it won't let him fall. He looks at the straw-hat menace. He doesn't look THAT imposing. Not compared to some of the things he and Ed have seen. 

 He looks down to Ed again, trying to whisper. ""Are you really going to duel him?""



The dock worker considers his hands a moment before wiping them off on his pants, nodding towards the ship in question.  ""Pirates keep asking for'm, and there's another duel.  Been going on for almost two weeks now.""  He starts to return to his work, adding, ""S'how they find a pecking order, I wot.""  Seems that's all the questions he'll answer; he's already moving away with a heavy coil of rope slung over one shoulder.

As for the boy speaking to the youth with the straw hat?  He heads off, vanishing into the throng that cross the boardwalk.  The one in the straw hat, clad in a pair of black denim shorts cut off at the knees, hemp sandals and a red t-shirt with a white '01' printed on the front, leans against the rail for a moment, watching the two Alchemists on approach.

The reason he's here?  To try to make sure the Going Merry continues to be -his- possession; he needs it, if he's going to achieve his own dark ambitions.  Crew?  They can be discarded, replaced.  Some just work better than others, and so they remain until they've lived out their usefulness.  No attachments.  No fondness.  'Nakama'?  Don't be naive.

It's a simple, cruel fact of the world.  The moment you show weakness is the moment you fall, losing everything.

Once he sees them heading towards his ship, Luffy steps down the ramp to meet them on the dock itself, giving both a crooked grin.  ""Ed!  I was wondering when you'd visit.""  And... the -hell- is this guy in huge armor?  ""...Na?"" says the captain inquisitively, pointing towards Al with a confused expression while he walks...backwards, away from them.  And now he's beckoning them to follow, grinning.

""Come on, come on.  I haven't gotten to show you around.""  What?  Okay.  Apparently he thinks they're here as tourists.



""Duelling makes it sound so -- formal. Luffy isn't /formal/.""

At least, not the Luffy Edward knows. But at least the pirate man explains 'pecking order'. He glances here and there, sees ships that probably have crews mostly of Winterheart, even if this IS a Golden Hall port -- one can never really be the /law/ in a port city. THere are just too many places to /go/.

But since Luffy's so helpful in coming down to see him, Ed offers him a smile, and then says, ""Oi, that's my brother, Alphonse. Al, this is Luffy."" He strarts after the other boy, not relaxing one bit.

Oilbird said there is something /wrong/, and he wants to know what it is. ""Nah, Luffy -- where's your nakama? Don't I get to meet them here?"" he asks, padding after. First, find out relations with htose close to him. Nothing drives a man down the wrong road like something bnad happening to those who he loves -- and possibly, couldn't protect. CASE IN POINT: Edward Elric.



Indeed. Alphonse is confused. The grin is off-setting, but...he doesn't seem dangerous. Nothing about him exudes danger, except maybe that smile, and the duels--all right, that's just not normal, or at least not good. ""Pleased to meet you."" Still, he is polite, and bows to Luffy as he walks right past. Very strange--but he's not quite getting danger sense yet. Maybe it comes of Ed knowing him better. There are some strange people in the dream, after all. Perhaps this Luffy isn't one of them, normally? Still, he follows, the groan of the dock's boards quickly replaced with the clang of cobblestones against his hollow steel feet.



It's a formality, but in the way that wolves choose an Alpha in the pack.  There are pirate crews aplenty in Bluefinger Port.  Luffy, the way he is right now, will sooner start cracking skulls together to prove just -who- is top dog around here, than risk the crew being pushed out by more aggressive pirates.  Duels?  Formal, yes.  But then again, there's little formality in beating the hell out of a rival crew's captain just outside of town.

Luffy turns his head occasionally to make sure--well, not so much if he's going to walk into anyone than if anyone's daring to walk into -him-, but more or less keeps his attention on the Elric brothers.  ""Al?""  Finally, an easy name!  Names like 'Ed' and 'Al' are easy; they don't require their own special (and occasionally outrageously funny) nicknames.  (( Pleased to meet you. ))  He smirks at the display of manners.

""You don't sound as big as you look.""

""...They're around,"" he says evasively, cutting him a sideways glance.  Great.  How much does he know?  ""Hey, did you see a guy named Knives recently?""  He asks, watching them closely.  If they seem to have, he'll suspect that Knives is starting to interfere again.  If not?  That'll give him reason to relax.  ""What about you and--uh, that girl you live with.  Blonde hair.  Wrench.""  Haha.  Winry.




Edward will let Al -- if he wants -- explain why he is bigger then he sounds. The piping, sweet voice of his ten year old baby brother coming out of that armor.... well. He just shakes his head. Al asked for it. Al will have to live with it.

""-- what? You know Knives?"" Wait, yes, hadn't the plant mentioned the pirates at some time? He couldn't recall. It'd been months since Knives had come by, seen to Nina, and left again. ""No. I've not seen Knives in--"" a snort, half laugh, ""Dog's age."" Alexander's, to be precise.

But the sudden jump to Winry takes Edward off guard. He has the decency to blush, thinking of how they'd spent their last evening together, before he'd hit the road. ""She's fine."" A glance is canted to Al. Not word! Not a word about him blushing like an idiot. Eh-heh. ""She-- said you came to let her know about what happened with Winterheart. I'm glad you went to her. She helped bring me home.""

He considers then, and asks, curiously, ""Will I get to see your ship?"" A glance back to the Ram-headed Going Merry; hmph. Yeah, there's something abnormal here, but he doesn't know what it is yet. ""And your crew. Wouldn't have come this far for nothin', I hope...""



""It's..."" Hey, Al asked for it. It doesn't mean he has to be comfortable relating it to everyone he meets. ""It's a long story."" Especially not increasingly creepy little people who just seem to keep smiling. And now Ed's blushing at the mention of Winry, and glaring at him. No, he won't say a word. And you'll never know, Ed, if he'd be smiling, confused, shocked, or any host of emotions at that flush in your cheeks--the impassive glare of the armor helm is all he replies with. The ship sits behind them as they walk away, and he's lost. Literally, yes, he's never really been to bluefinger. But Ed and Luffy hopefully know their way around, and that'll help. But the things they're tlaking about, mostly, seem to catch him off-guard, some things having meanings as clear to him as though they were in another language.



""Knew.""  Luffy's bland smirk and nonchalant demeanor - fundamentally different than the carefree smiles and guileless good humor of before - waver for a moment when a frown appears.  ""He hurt a few of my crew and ran off.  I should've known he never changed.""  There's a note that rings false if you know him; Al would be out of luck here, but Edward?  Given their extensive discussions on defining 'nakama', the fact the word is missing entirely is like a piano key obnoxiously out of tune.

As if he instinctually meant to cover this up, he grins slyly at the blonde Alchemist, noting his blush.  ""Ohhhhh, so it's -more- than a girl you just live with.  --She did?  Good.  Sounds like you lived through that,"" he adds, glancing towards the large armor following.

Fortunately, it seems he does know his way around, as he starts towards a wooden warehouse that, according to a sign, will soon be reconstructed for a shipwright to set up shop there.  Good thing, too, because it looks kind of like it hasn't been renovated since the zombies had been routed.

""The ship?  Later.  The crew's scattered around Bluefinger right now.  Errands, I guess.""  Removing his straw hat long enough to scrub a hand through disheveled black hair, the Captain turns to look at Edward.  ""On the other hand.""

""You never struck me as the kind of guy to go sightseeing."" His straw hat is placed back on his head, casting a shadow across eyes half-lidded when he turns a cool stare at Edward.  ""What are you after?""  Yeeahhh. That wouldn't be a friendly question.



The word 'crew' clangs miserably everytime it's spoken, so in turn, Edward uses 'nakama' when he speaks again. ""Does you nakama like Bluefinger so far?"" He asks, looking at Luffy's back. ""And -- Knives is -- sort of family. It's -- a long story. But I've not seen him in a long time."" He's not /welcome/ family, but, still-- Nina loves him as Knives-papa, and Ed won't break that bond. Even if he /is/ planning on solidifying his family unit. All in good time, with a ring and a promise and some paperwork, yes...

And then Luffy asks the million dollar question.

""You know,"" he says, ""Warehouses aren't very friendly places to have discussions, Luffy. And I'm not here to duel you. I just -- had a heads up you might be in need of some help."" What kind of help? Depends. The 'can we talk about it' help, or maybe the 'can I punch you in the mouth till you stop saying stupid things' kind of help. Who knows? Ed's not sure.



The last time Al was in a place like this, he remembers the Homunculus Sloth--his and Ed's mistake from so long ago--dissolving away into nothing but gas. So yes, now he's certainly on edge now, scanning this place as though expecting to see a pirate zombie miraculously hidden for so long shuffle out; it's ominous, now. But he's letting Ed do the talking, and playing the big bad backup. Still, the innocent child's voice breaks that image a little again, when he speaks up to back up his brother. ""Yeah. We're here to help.""



Showing them around had been his first idea.  Keep them away from the rest and perhaps usher them out of Bluefinger Port without suspecting anything... until he heard that they knew Knives.  That was when there had been a shift in his destination plans to here, a somewhat secluded part of the docks that didn't see much traffic.  Plenty of room.  Multiple ways to cut and run, except by the sea, which would forever be an enemy should he fall in it.

So while Edward addresses the choice in location, Luffy crosses his arms with a knowing, slow smile, nodding twice.

""Dueling you?  Hah, don't make me laugh,"" he answers with a low-voiced condescension that sounds as unwelcome and alien in his throat as finding a scorpion in your bedding.  ""You're not a pirate.""

He brings his hands together, fingers working his joints loose with a crackle.  ""I see.  So, Oilbird's Priest.  You here to 'redeem' me?"" asks the straw-hatted youth with a thin grimace that could be a grin.  ""I don't need your help.  Here's a heads up: Leave, and forget you ever knew me.""



""Damn right I'm not a pirate,"" Edward drawls. ""I'm an alchemist. The /Fullmetal Alchemist/."" He sighs, and then begins to take off his gloves; they'll be ruined shortly anyway, tucking them into a pocket. This is going to be a fight. He can tell. The fact he's worn his 'old gear'; the long red coat, the leather pants, sleeveless undershirt, black over-shirt, and his broad belt, /screams/ that he knew this was going to come down to a fight. He hates being right. 

His braid is flipped over one shoulder, to hang down nearly to the base of his back. It's only this -- this long, long hair, and the fact he ha grown a little, filled out some more, and aged just a touch that makes this scene of Alphone and Edward together slightly jarring to the image of them, ready to tackle a new problem, five or six years ago.

""I can't do that, Luffy. I don't abandon my friends. Nakama-- means sometimes, that people get hurt. But-- I don't want you to be what hurts them, Luffy. Once this is over, you'd never forgive yourself.""



Al would normally be worried about things devolving into a fight. But hey, sometimes you've got to break some bones. In Luffy's case, that's probably not possible, but maybe a little pounding might help. ""He's right, Luffy. If this isn't the regular you, and you end up hurting people, then when you're normal again it'll just hurt inside."" Yep. The brothers know all about guilt and pain. And they know all about heavy psychotherapy by hard knocks, too. Al crosses his arms. ""We're sorry about this.""



A straw hat is pulled off, carried between a few fingers just beneath a malevolent grin shaded by ragged, black hair.  It's flicked towards the ground, ""Nakama, nakama, nakama.  I'm so sick of your naive bullshit.""  Now empty fingers lower, hooking at the air and then curling into a fist while he assumes a battle-ready almost-crouch.

""Kakatte koi~, Edo,"" singsongs the pirate lowly, baring teeth in a slow smirk.  Come on.  Bring it.  Can't you see he's coaxing out your violence?  Bring it, let him drink deep of hate and malice, let him shatter every friend his host body has ever known.  ""It's time to lose -everything-.""

Breaking some bones, as Ed may have discovered when they fought - on the same side - against some of Winterheart's best vampiric soldiers outside Golden Hall, is more or less impossible.

Unless you're Roc.  Then, Luffy's SOL.  Al's apology is met with a sudden, wide grin.  Almost manic.  ""Not as sorry as you'll be in five minutes.""  A sandal stomps on the ground, turns, and he's launched himself into the air, aiming to land - if possible - on Alphonse's shoulders, clamping his grip down on the helmet.

""If you've got any last words for Al--too late!""  A -twist- would've probably snapped an unexpecting person's neck, except all that effort is wasted on how -easy- it is to remove a helmet with nothing beneath it.

Needless to say, that sends Luffy toppling off with an empty helmet in his arms.  Blinking, his first reaction is a startled one.

""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!""



""That's the price of sin, Luffy! I'm sure you're about to become REALLY familiar with it!"" 

Clap, flash! With Luffy overhead, Edward goes right ahead and warps the ground benneath them, aiming a solid stone beam launching out of the ground for the pirate's face. And if that's not enough, Edward's going right up it as it forms.

Never one afraid to get physical, even with things that could, potentially, beat the shit out of him (Greed, anybody?) -- he is more then willing to go right up to the beam to, just in case it missed, take a vicious swinging kick to attempt to see if he can rattle Luffy's teeth.

There is no pulling punches. You just tried to /kill his fucking baby brother/. IT's moments like this that Mockingbird comes to sit by Oilbird and moon, you know. Soon as Oilbird's done with him, Mockingbird's jostling for a piece of Edward Elric, rabidly protective of kith and kin.

'sides. Edward's very aware of how tough Luffy is. So best not to play like he's happy fluffy pirate boy for now. He can, and will, fight to win -- and Edward counts on Luffy doing the same.



""WAUGH!"" The shout is coming from the head in Luffy's hands, not form the empty armor. ""Put me back!"" Of course, Luffy probably won't. But in his shock, hopefully, the panicked grab on the back of the shirt and the sharp yank to slam the psychotic pirate into the ground won't be caught in time...is head's facing the wrong way, though--all he registers is the give of a body beyond what bones should allow. Oh, dear god--he's shattered him. ""I'm sorry!"" He shouts. ""I didn't mean for that to be so hard!""



Grounded doesn't mean disadvantaged; the fall alone wasn't even nearly enough to warrant an 'ouch', despite his velocity being fueled by his expectation to meet resistance when he tried to twist Al's head off.  Luffy throws the helmet aside with a ringing clang, but as predicted, his distraction is enough that he's seized by his shirt and slammed into the ground.  There should have been the sickening crunch of bones or at least a cry of pain.

There's neither, nothing louder than a cough of breath expelled from the lungs, something that almost sounds like a laugh.  A second is spent still, and then Luffy lifts his head, looking no more worse for wear but for some dirt and tousled hair.  ""Not bad--but you're not my type.""

He shakes off the hand on his shirt, throwing his feet over his head in an improvised backflip, managing to retreat -just- out of range of the rising, alchemically manipulated block of stone by a staggering, hopping backpedal.

His style of combat is graceless and to the point, using his body's resilience and flexibility to full advantage.  As Edward might know - and fully realize now, at least - against someone like Luffy, bludgeoning damage is nearly worthless, unless one is especially powerful.

Though, he's used to fighting a crowd of lackeys before cutting to the chase, but hey--sometimes, time is short enough that you just gotta skip the foreplay.

Luffy takes the swinging boot right to the jaw, staggering sharply sideways and using that turn to whip an arm around to grab the boot by the ankle.  He hasn't even straightened his head, only glaring at Edward out of the corner of one eye (grinning).  A tug of his leg forward.  Here, Ed.  Meet his foot, in a ruthless snap kick aimed for his groin.  ""Down.""



Hello, world of hurt. Not ONLY is Edward's metal leg fully extended, and caught, but he is unable to really twist away in an adequet defense. Sure he got to move a little, but enough that Luffy's sandaled foot doesn't take him off his other foot and sends him down in a /really bad stretch, one leg one way the other -- well, folding under him awkwardly.

And Edward? He can't even SEE STRAIGHT, a soft hiss of breath and a high pitched whine the only indication that the kick didn't trigger a /heart attack/, though he swears it came close. Don't you know Ed's heart is bad, Luffy? And kicking a guy there CAN cause a heart attack!

Thankfully? Ed's a little bit tougher then that. But it's not going to stop him from curling around his now abused testicles, with tears in his eyes.

Al? He's all yours!



Oh, don't worry, Edward.  You won't be allowed to fall -right- away.  See, though the grip on his ankle does loosen to let the weight of a metal leg bring it down, his outstretched leg stamps down and he scoops an arm under Edward's, catching him.  Why?

For the perverse pleasure of hearing that single, pained sound.

There's a satisfied noise growled into his ear before before the Fullmetal Alchemist is allowed to crumple to the ground.  /Good/ boy.  Stay.  Don't worry.  He'll be back in -just- a moment.  Luffy steps lightly over the curled up form of the alchemist to meet his brother, eyes alight with dark amusement.

Seal?  He wouldn't know what to do with it, though he does note the reddish mark on the inside of the suit of armor, near where the helmet had been.  Luffy grabs the hair of the top of his head and /pulls/, his neck stretching enough that Al's fist sails in a very near miss of its intended target.

""Empty armor?  Did you eat a Devil Fruit?  Haha, omoshiree,"" he notes aloud.  Omoshiree?  In short, he finds you 'interesting', but that's his catch-all phrase for anything he finds unusual enough for amusement.  A hand clasps the metal arm near his shoulder and he vaults himself up, his other hand clapping over the rim of the armor - just above the seal - before leaping inside.

His voice comes echoing out.  ""Roomy!  But what's -this- thing?""  Fingers drum on the seal.  ""Edo~?  Shiranee ka?  Do you know? o/`""




Ed is going to be whining and clutching himself on the ground for a while now. Ow. Fuck. Ow ow ow. 

After being so gently lowered to the ground, he has to breath hard, battle nausea, and blink tears from his eyes, face now wet. Oh god. That hurt. It hurt a /lot/. He is gonna need ice and an athletic supporter, /stat/. But he can't really /think/ about that when he hears the echoing voice of /Luffy/ in his brother's vulnerable body.

No, no, no! That's not good. Eyes go wide, as his body renews itself through crazed adrenaline rush. Pain is forgotten; the limp is still there, the movement of one leg exagerated, but still, Edward is on his feet, eyes getting that focus that many have learned to fear or exploit in the young alchemist.

Al soon has two people on him; if it were anyone but Luffy, anyone but Luffy at all, he would have bladed that arm of his and just stabbed till the attacker stopped moving. It's /Luffy/ that keeps him from having his blood splatter against Al's.

""DON'T YOU TOUCH MY BROTHER,"" he says, tenor wild and voice akin to a roar. Intent on dragging Luffy bodily out any way he can, breath short, hard, and face flushed. He's not all there right now, Luffy. Thankfully, there's someone here, someone who hung back -- to keep him from going totally ballistic.

Ysabel, hoofbeats chiming like bells, clatters over cobblestones. She wants to be closer to her chosen; certainly, she was asked to wait back at the inn that Ed had checked into -- but he's her Chosen. She won't leave him to fight alone...

And she won't let him slip over the edge, not even for Al. She doesn't enter the combat; merely waits at the fringes, her voice for Edward alone, wrenching him back from frenzy, reminding him to focus.




""Hey! Get out!"" Martel did that. Al kind of liked her...but that was after he got to know her. Al doesn't know Luffy. He doesn't like Luffy. That's just wierd! It occurs to him, vaguely, that there should have been some kind of pain when Luffy tap-tap-tapped on his seal--the sensitivity of something threatening the anchor of his soul. ""I don't know what a devil fruit is--get out already!"" One thing is on his mind--his brother, his brother in pain, and while he feels it--the drum of fingers certianly isn't missed--the comcommitant instinctive terror and pain aren't even figuring into the equation If Mockingbird's watching Ed and waiting, Killdeer is nestling hapily around him, and her gift protects him here, and lets him act instead of react. He swings his chestplate open, grabbing and flinging wildly in the confusion, the tangle of Luffy and his brother and himself and Ysabel? What is she doing here? If he succeeds, and Luffy goes flying in whatever direction he can manage, then hopefully he can take a moment to grab his head--it's kind of unnerving to see yourself moving around as an outsider. Especially without a head.




This is the grip of someone who, to protect a navigator he'd grown fond of, had broken a length of tempered steel half an inch thick with a single squeeze of his fingers.

Ah, but -that- had been the kind of strength that he summons to his limbs when he's good and angry, and this?  This is all -play-, but just the same, all that jostling and struggling (the better to give you a harder time of things, dear brothers) might result in the protesting creak of metal... but none such sound comes.  This would be the first time Luffy's encountered a metal of that width he could not at least bend--unless it were seastone.

But it's not, or this fight would be over already.

Damnable Aspirans!  Oh yes, the Darkened soul wearing Luffy's face had known of them, you learn a lot while you're trapped with other wandering spirits in the Ruined Crescent, but to realize his opponent is one of their chosen is an unwelcome revelation.

Luffy hisses an expletive in frustration, shortly before he hurtles out of the open chestplate, but, with an agility true to his namesake, he throws back a hand to seize the back of Edward's--clothes, shirt, coat, braid, whatever he can reach first-- with aim to yank him into the ground.

If he can manage that much?  Edward may find himself thrust facefirst into the ground with a knee grinding viciously into his lower back, an arm hooked around his throat and another hand fisted in his hair, his grip tight enough to set the nerves of the scalp to -screaming-.  And Luffy, hissing violence into his ear.

""I should fucking kill you -now-.  RIGHT HERE.  Let your precious brother -watch-!""




As if he weren't abused enough already; Edward is now belly to the ground, bent and bleeding from the scalp where his hair is torn from his skin; he gasps and struggles for air as his windpipe is closed, jaw working trying to open, only succeeding in biting his cheek, frothing blood on his lips, like he'd gone feral and rabid.

""Wouldn't be the first time he -- wa-- watched me-- di-- die--"" he grates out, even as he forces his hands together, the CLAP! a sharp echo before he puts them to the earth again and cobblestones become sharp, jagged things, stabbing at Luffy's thighs and legs, sides and arms, though Edward still does not aim to /kill/, merely to /hurt/. It'll be a mistake he may not have the oppourtunity to repeat later.



Tsk. Al's head is going to have to wait--you do NOT threaten his brother. Ohana means family, or some crap like that--those two are doggedly protective of each other, Luffy. He was willing to rip off a scared and confused little boy's limbs because they were Ed's, dammit. 
This makes that little incident seem distant and harmless. And Al never had any opportunity to develop the general fondness for Luffy that stays his elder brother's hands a bit. He reaches with hands that crush stone and steel, grabbing a tight hold of Luffy if he can and slamming any part of the pirate he can into the ground, into the spikes. It's an angry child's tantrum--perhaps driven by some righteousness and love--but that's buried under the rage, punctuated with the slam of Al's fists and anything he can grab into the stonework. ""LEAVE! ED! ALONE! LEAVE HIM ALONE! LEAVE HIM ALONE!"" It's a simple mantra, repeated over and over--Al would have tears streaming down his face if he could, right now, to leave trails of rust he wouldn't forget. Instead, on this rare occasion, the death's-head of the helmet, watching impassively from afar, suits him perfectly.



Luffy's nose is sensitive.  Not as acute as Chopper's sense of smell, but his is particularly attuned to smells familiar to his ship - cooking food, wood dust, gunpowder, sea salt and tangerines - and those found in combat.  The smell of blood he's no stranger to, so there's a chuckle very quiet by the alchemist's ear--a sound that becomes a choked utterance.

That's held breath for a moment, and then a yell of pain.  The grip of his arm tightens but the hand at his hair lifts to slam down on a metal shoulder, fingers clenching through cloth until it finds the border of metal and pulls hard while blood flows warm down his forearm in the effort.  A grunt of effort becomes a hacking cough, eyes wide, when Alphonse's blows cause stone spikes to pierce deeper than he'd accomplished at the beginning.  It's not that his lungs were pierced, only that the feat of strength has caused significant enough -agony- that he had to disguise the urge to scream with a cough.

""Son of a /BITCH/,"" swears the pirate, whose hand dives into the bent-back segment of metal to seize whatever he can find in there (in this case, metal wires) and wrench them, twisting.  Do you see?  Look at the way his arm is hooked around Edward's neck!  ""I'll -break- it!""  I'm -sorry-!  ""I'll break his fucking neck if you don't--"" I'm sorry!! ""--back--"" /EDWARD/, DAMMIT! ""--OFF!""

Luffy's voice cracks--emotion?  And here's a contradiction in the most visible of ways; he screams gutteral, furious, -angry- and hateful, it's wordless but still he's -twisting- the wires connected to Edward's nerves, and yet there's something hot and pricking blurring his vision.  He can blame it on pain, the body's natural and instinctual response to shed tears at the scream of nerves.



Bell-chime hoof-strikes as Ysabel tracks closer, her approach musical depite her deadly intent. ++ Alphonse; he is caught between -- don't push him! ++ In short, he can pop Edward's head off. Please don't let him do that.

After all, Edward is -- a little unhappy right now. He is not screaming; oh, he's white to his lips, and there is blood coming in spurts as wires rooted in the -meat- of his body rip and tear, and there is fresh, hot blood on Luffy's hands, because really, where did he think those wires /went/? Not just to the metal, no! No they burrow into his body, each relaying a thought, a motion, a demand from his flesh and blood body for his arm to form; relaying bioelectric energy to fuel the limb's motion.

The limb is dead weight now, the port bent, the wires ripped; a spasmodic flopping, like a fish, proceeds it's silence, as Edward, eyes wide and unseeing, swallows his pain. 

He doesn't scream. His body jerks, convulsions having their way with his small frame, but he /does not scream/.

He's had worse.



Ysabel doesn't have to tell Al to stop--the moment Luffy makes his threat, Al stops--literally in mid-slam. ""Let him go."" Is his voice pleading? Maybe. There's emotion in there, to be sure. ""Let him go!"" He wants to let go. He wants to squeeze him until he pops. He wants his brother to be safe. He wants to take this psychopath and tie his neck around his ankle and his arms and legs to stones and toss him in the harbor. ""Why are you doing this?"" The question is quiet, even from Al's head across the room. 

""Why are you hurting him? He was talking to you like a friend. Why?"" His hand is still in the shaky emotion of his voice--the tremors of muscles have nothing in him, and so the headless thing leaning over Luffy may as well be a statue. But it feels in a heart that by all reason it lacks, as raw and deep as the wounds that his brother feels now. ""Why?"" 

His hand loosens, just a bit--he can't bring himself to let go of this man--not while he has his arm around his brother's throat, and his hand on bloody wires.



How dare you.

How DARE you deny him at least ONE satisfaction, when he's had to endure your brother's protectiveness and wounds caused by the alchemy you produced with a clap of your hands?

A hot rage is his morphine.  In spite of blood slipping fresh from deepened wounds along every limb and his sides, with a strain of sinew beneath his skin he growls an animal's impatience.  And twists the wires again, creaking between fingers now painted slick crimson with the alchemist's own blood.

""Why?"" Did someone cut his face?  It feels... wet.  He coughs a dry laugh during his grim work.  Come on, come /on/, /scream/.  ""'Nakama', 'loyalty', 'affection', that's why!  All this weakness!  I have no taste for it!""  Luffy lowers his head against Edward's bleeding shoulder, gasping for a moment.

"".....I want to destroy -everything- he ever loved or cherished.  When there's nothing left, there's no way I'll go back 'there'.""

He tosses back his head, yanking on those wires with a bark of mad laughter, but why has he been crying?  ""Don't you GET IT?  This is my last chance!  I won't fade away!""  Oh, right.  He's totally lost it.




Another hard spurt of blood; with all the entrances there in that arm, it should come as no surprise that Ed'll bleed out quickly; his convulsions have gotten weaker, his face white, lips pale. More wires spring loose with each twist, and Edward just looks up at Al, eyes fixing on him; don't, don't, don't. Don't get hurt. He's fine. He'll take it -- the position of older brothers is to make sure the younger have an easier path.

This isn't what he intended, certainly.

Coughing on blood, working it's way past his paling lips, Edward puts his good hand, glove now smeared with blood up toward Al; he hears voice --- Ysabel's, begging him to be strong, that she'll save him -- and another, a softer voice, Oilbird's, promising him that he gets closere very dayfrom being free of this kind of burden -- that he is closer then he thinks...

And he reaches back, hand weak, to touch at Luffy's face, blood mingling with tear tracks.

""N--nakama means -- more people -- get hurt,"" he coughs out, voice raw, grating. ""Remember-- it doesn'-- mean th--th--they go away. Just mea-- means they fi--fight ha--haar--harder... because they l-love you, i-idiot.""

The worse you fight love, the stronger it fights back; Winry in Winterheart, coming after him, Tony in the suit, sinking into death for his sake, Alphonse's sacrifice so they could be like /brothers/ again, rather then strangers... He knows-- the more you fight hte people you love, the harder they fight to /save/ you.

And then there are those who don't care if Edward loves you, Luffy; for Ysabel lets him get through his speech, snaking forward, her fangs bared. She /will/ throat you, Luffy, if she does it with her last spasm of her dying body, once you squeeze the life from her Chosen. ++ Let him go, Luffy, and you may yet escape to fight us again. ++



""You think making all your friends go away will make you stronger?"" Still not moving. ""You think you become stronger by not being able to give? I've seen too many people fall apart when they lost everything to believe you."" Scar. Martel. What would have happened, if Ed and Al hadn't had each other, at least? ""It's not weakness."" Says Al. ""It's what makes us strong. My brother wouldn't be strong if he didn't love Winry and Nina and me and everyone else."" He wishes he could look his brother in the eyes here, instead of watching everything he's doing like a foreign observer. But there is one small benefit to his unique perspective--he sees the tears on Luffy's face; he sees the conflict, and perhaps it is this that makes him release his grip. ""It hurts sometimes. And it hurts a lot. But we make it through because we're strong, and the ties between us are stronger.""



He's wearing that manic grin because where he's cut it's all threads of fire, but he's thinking he just might get away with this, that he might just manage to reach the end of the days necessary to wait and acclimate to a body that doesn't belong to him: He might survive until he'll be impossible to exorcise and this will be -his- body at last.

But that's an expression frozen when he feels fingers on his face, eyes wide.

(( It had been at a crossroads, with a stone mile marker at his side, a mug in hand.  ""But for someone like you, you have people to protect here, na?"" Luffy's tone had been lighter than he felt. ""Stuff that's happened before that you don't want messing them up, right?"" ))

A very quiet sound - more like a breathless wince, only half-formed - is uttered, fingers twitching.

(( ""Yeah,"" Edward had been surprised. ""I do. There are -- people I love here. People -- I owe debts to, as well. I don't want to see any of them... hurt."" ))

He can't move.  He wants to silence him -now- and can't move.  He feels more cold and immobile than he'd been when Aokiji turned him into little more than an ice sculpture, if that had even been possible.

(( ""It's not weakness.""  ""It's what makes us strong. )) Gods, how many times had he said those same things himself?  How many times he'd felt this fact so fiercely he thought his heart might -burst-?

(( ""That cold bastard,"" Luffy had said into his mug, ""Really did a number on you, huh."" ))

He had become the very thing he'd despised most.  And now there's something -speaking- to him inside his head, not Hoatzin, something else (the thing with chimes in its feet), but his arm is already loose around the Alchemist's throat, fingers already dropping from the wires he'd been twisting.

If he could say something, scream something that would define the outrage that vestige he had left for what that Darkened force had caused his hands to do, if he could scream his disgust for it, or the horror of living out a nightmare that was not visited on onesself but on /other people/, he would.

As it is, all the strength that sliver of /himself/ that still exists can spend is being used now, in that Luffy is paralyzed, stunned.




And this is when the Aspiran moves; fangs lash out, bared and sharp to grab at an arm, to JERK and to DRAG while Edward goes slack, eyes closing, blood pooling under his body. She wants you OFF HER CHOSEN RIGHT NOW. And she's going to get it. ++ Healer, Alphonse, healer! Get him out of here! Down the boardwalk, to the center city. ++ She would call for help herself, but Al will probably do better. 

Still, Edward's body is left to go cold and still, his eyes fixing on Luffy, brows furrowing. Why does it keep ending this way? THis isn't how it's supposed to be. God, what happened to the Trade? What has his suffering bought him? The black ring 'round his finger, betrayal, and -- a home, sometimes, to retreat too. 

Winry will be so angry. His arm moves up, slowloy, to lay over his ruined, ripped automail, as blood seeps through his fingers. ""I... broke my promise,"" he murmurs to no one in particular. ""I promised -- I wouldn't break it this time.""



Al doesn't think twice--he barely even thinks once. Ed is in his arms and bleeding, and he runs for the door, reaching down for the tassel on his helm with one hand and slamming it on in a momentary dizziness. ""Be strong, Luffy."" The words are a prayer, more than advice--he has no time to turn and address them to the pirate directly. He has no time to run. He needs to be at the healer's NOW. And so he just sprints, his shoulder barreling through the remainder of a wall that's IN HIS WAY, DAMMIT, and he continues to run. He hopes nobody gets in front of them. He'll feel bad and apologize and all later, but right now that wall probably just the first on the list of things he's going to bust through to get his brother to prompt medical attention.



That fangs are grabbing his arm and jerking him off of the Alchemist--that this feeling at all is registered in the otherwise unresponsive pirate is only in a spasmatic twitch of his fingers when nerves protest.  He only rolls onto his back, staring.  

He had become -no better- than Harth.

He had brought pain, injury, distress to everyone he knew.  He'd done it -laughing- much of the time.

And look at what he'd done to -EDWARD-, who he'd eaten with, gotten -drunk- with, LAUGHED with?  Who he considered one of his coolest friends outside of the crew of the Going Merry, and still he had said:

""...Na...kama?""

The automail.  Gods, Winry's going to be killing mad at him, if Alphonse isn't.  Be... strong?

How strong can a fragment, a mere sliver of one's spirit be?

Apparently, strong enough to be still, be quiet, because to do anything else right now risks an attack that might end the Fullmetal Alchemist's life right here and now.



Pale in Alphonse arms, Edward has finally slipped into unconsciousness, his blood on his brother has it has been in the past; perhaps too close to the way it was, once, when he saved Al's soul with his blood and bone. He tries to hold on -- for her. She'll cry, dammit, if Al comes home alone; she'll cry and he can't /bear/ to think of her crying, not even as he's still in Al's arm. It'll kill him, if she cries for him again. 

He shouldn't make somebody he loves cry so much.

With Luffy subdued -- within and without, perhaps, Ysabel, steps away, toward the door that had been kicked open by angry hooves. Al, of course, MADE his own door and -- it's more then big enough for her to get through, black body streaking after her Chosen, trying to bolster his spirit with her own love -- she does not want him to fall, nor to fall /with/ him."

"event","Usopp finds evidence that the previous night was in fact not a nightmare, and challenges Luffy for Captainship!  Darkened Luffy reveals what it is that Luffy Forgot, and it's not just the existance of the One Piece...

<lj-cut text=""MERRY IS NOT DYING!"">

What's this all about anyway? This morning, the crew would have found several signs posted around the ship, informing them that they should all meet this afternoon.

Well, more specifically, they said 'Everyone should come to the deck of the Going Merry at 3. Luffy especially! I have an announcement to make. --Usopp-sama'

In any case, Usopp is standing on the shore, arms crossed, expression flat, as he waits for the crew to assemble. Or, more specifically, for Luffy to arrive, since this is all about him.


A stormy night had been a productive one--moreso if only there hadn't been an interruption of conscience (not his own) to prevent him from capping it off with murder--if not a complete success.  He had a perfect alibi.  There had been a party, Luffy supposedly had too much to drink and wandered off into Bluefinger Port.  Came back the next morning in a fantastic mood that lingered on until he found the posted sign.

It couldn't be anything to worry about.  After all, it's just Usopp.

Three o'clock rolls around.  That is to say, the clock tower tolls thrice, but Luffy doesn't emerge from below deck until the last echoes have faded.  Hands in his pockets, wearing a grin fueled by his own dark amusement.

""Hey, Usopp,"" the captain says pleasantly, ""What are you doing down there?""


The marksman is patient. And as Luffy steps up onto the deck, a half-grin curls up one side of his face. Well, that confirms one suspicion. ""Waiting for you, Luffy. There's something I have to say and it's best said up close."" Ooookay. Well that's strange. Still, Usopp can be random and weird at times with his whims. Maybe he wants to show off a new invention.

Usopp's arms slowly uncross, and he lifts one to wave at the others who have shown up for this. No, no big smiles. He's just waving at them to stay where they are for now. The show will start soon, no worries.


Just what has he confirmed?  That, this Luffy doesn't know.  But then, he had been -so- certain of himself, so sure that no one could have noticed a few of those small quirks he's been displaying since his revival after their trip into the Ruined Crescent.  So sure that no one but the currently-forgetful Nami knew or suspected the tolling of the clocktower brought back memories that debilitated him with dread.

So what, he wonders, does that smile mean?

""Sou ka.""  He's as gullible as the owner of his host body, but this one is suspicious of everyone and everything.  But that's not the reason he hesitates at the top of the gangplank.  He hesitates because--

(( Tonight at 10!  I'll come back here!  We'll duel for the right to have Going Merry! ))
--it reminds him--
(( You look determined but don't regret your decision later.  This is what you want! ))
--of something he'd Forgotten.

""...?"" Luffy tilts his head.  And then throws it back laughing, while he walks down the gangplank to join him.  ""--You just reminded me of something, Usopp!""

Why are you here?

He stops in front of the marksman, hands at his side.  ""Go ahead.""


As the captain approaches, Usopp lowers his hand again. ""You know, Luffy. At first, I thought I was crazy. I started to doubt myself. Then I thought I was having a dream."" He shrugs vaguely, as if this was no big deal, turning slightly to face to the side. ""Then I wanted to check on something. I felt something was wrong with the ship, so I went to make sure. And there it was...""

Turning again, Usopp fixes Luffy with a flat glare. Cue the closeup. ""Scratches in the bathtub from the weights. It wasn't a dream. You really did those things and said those things. Did you do that to the others, I wonder, or just me? How many of our nakama did you torture then drug to make them think it was a dream? All of them? Some of them?"" Yeah, he'll let everyone chew on that for a bit. Hear that? It wasn't a dream.

Arms lowering once more, Usopp ignores any reactions the crew might have to that revelation. Instead, he levels his gaze at Luffy again. ""Luffy our captain would never do something like that. Luffy our captain hates when captains mistreat their nakama. You are not Luffy, my captain. I can't let you be the captain anymore!""

It's taking all of Usopp's self-control right now to keep his expression stern, because he really, really wants to cry. He cried most of the morning thinking of how he was going to say this, and it still hurts to do so. But he won't now. ""Luffy, I challenge you to a duel for the right to be captain! I won't let you be captain in your state!""

And, as if to make it a more formal duel, Usopp pulls out a glove. Hey, maybe he's being old-fashioned. Lifting his arm, he brings the glove around to smack it against Luffy's face.

Except... gloves don't usually sound like WHAM! when they hit, nor do they have that much force. Luffy, meet the last Impact Dial Usopp has that was filled with a Gomu Gomu no Bazooka. It won't hit with full force because of the method of delivery, and the impact tears the dial-filled glove free of Usopp's hand, but hopefully it did its job, and without straining the marksman's shoulder this time!


(( You know, Luffy. ))  Luffy seems receptive, wearing a characteristically blank-faced attentiveness that could change at any moment to follow the path of a fly or a passing cloud, a smile that may have been at some private joke or the simple pleasure of being in the presence of a friend.  That expression fades at (( I thought I was having a dream. )) when he starts trying to tell himself that it's impossible.  This is -just- Usopp.  There is no way--

The scratches from the weights in the bottom of the tub.  Where he had tied Usopp to Zoro's own training weights and tried to drown him.  As Usopp goes on, that neutral stare slowly, slowly grows into a grin made malevolent by the shadow cast by his own straw hat over his eyes.  ""...Wow, Usopp.  You've really lost it this time.  How far are you going to take your lies?""

And for a moment it is a want to put his hands around his throat and -squeeze- that makes his fingers twitch in anticipation.

A duel.

He doesn't even give the raised glove a sideways glance, only watching Usopp with that hungry, murderous grin.  ""...This is what you want?  Then allow me to--""

One moment he's there, addressing Usopp in low tones, and in the next moment he's gone at the touch of the Impact Dial, flung sideways into gods only know what--except for the thunderous crash of the pirate's landing into a stack of crates.  

His straw hat drops to the ground at Usopp's feet.

By now, the docks have quickly been deemed a bad place to be; sailors and mariners scatter to find somewhere else to be while Luffy slowly picks himself up and steps out of the cloud of dust and debris, dragging his thumb across the corner of his mouth.

""Ohhhh, you're -really- getting it now..."" he chuckles, cleaning the bloodied pad of his thumb with his tongue.  Luffy punches the air, punches again, and this time repeats the act, taking a step forward each time until he's running, the speed of thrown punches quickly approaching the illustion of a hundred fists.

""Gomu Gomu no GATLING!""


The straw hat. The symbol of their pirate crew. Before Luffy can get back up, Usopp crouches down to pluck the hat from the ground, dusting it off neatly with one hand. ""You think this is a lie? You should know when I'm serious, Luffy!"" He doesn't keep the hat, though. No, he flings it toward the ship, hoping one of the observers will catch it. This battle is no place for that hat, and, even though Usopp is going to fight his hardest against Luffy, he doesn't want the rubberman's treasure to be destroyed.

""I should warn you, Luffy. I have eight thousand followers waiting in town!"" He -had- to say it. Perhaps some of the mariners in the area believe him, perhaps they don't Usopp doesn't care. When the rubberman starts his attack, Usopp quickly reaches into his bag, a grin coming to his face. ""That... won't work on me. Bakuyaku Sabotenboshi!"" This might be a little bit familiar to a Luffy that has his memories. For Usopp, he only knows that he cooked this up earlier this morning. The pellet flies, and rather than doing anything directly, it simple explodes outwards upon hitting one of the gatling fists, sending a spray of needles toward the captain. That... should stop the attack. He hopes.

If it does, Usopp takes the opportunity to point at Luffy, eyes narrowed. ""Usopp Spell! Bullet ants biting in between each of your toes for hours on end!""


Why would you do that, Usopp?  This man betrayed you.  He betrayed all of you.  He tormented many in turn for little more than personal -amusement-!  Is it instinct?  Is intuition telling you something, Usopp, or is it that you wouldn't stoop as low as he has?  Which is it?  Are you a man, or taking the moral high ground?

As a pirate, you, too, have a kind of honor that Luffy has neglected.  But that's why you're challenging him now, isn't it?

Eight thousand followers.  Luffy bares his teeth as his fists fly, sandals beating on the ground as he races towards the marksman.  ""I'm pretty sure you're JUST LYING, USOPP!"" he hollars, savoring an irony at the similarity to a duel that had happened once before--one that his host had forgotten.  One that the fragment of the host is reeling to recognize.  You see this, Luffy?  Look /real/ close.

This is the beginning of the end.

Needles?!  He's right; the gatling attack stops as quickly as it started, and with a brisk shake of his hands, he casts off the needles that had been stopped by his knuckles before sinking too deeply into skin, while he skids to a stop.  ""....Bullet ants?""  He blinks a moment.  ( The fragment within helpfully provides a definition. ...Fucker. )  ""AUGH, THAT'S HORRIBLE!!"" he yells, clapping his hands over his ears.

""Stop fucking around!  GOMU GOMU NO!  KAMA!"" Luffy cries, throwing out a foot to sweep at Usopp's own.


...Well, that worked better than expected! Perhaps this may turn out to be less of a desperation than he had originally thought. Moral high ground? No... He just can't think of destroying Luffy's treasure. Even if Luffy is like this, he refuses to let his nakama's treasure come to harm. And of course it's horrible, that's the whole point! Reaching into his bag again, Usopp draws out something else, taking aim while the mugiwara has his ears covered.

""Hissatsu Tamagoboshi!"" The rotten egg flies through the air, giving off quite a horrible sulphery smell when it bursts open. Of course... hecan't dodge everything. That leg sweep catches him off guard, and sends him flying back, closer to shore, to land with a loud thump.

Slowly, the marksman pushes himself up with one hand, using the other to wipe some blood from his mouth. ""You think..."" He coughs into his hand, more blood spurting out. Luffy didn't hit him -that- hard, did he? ""You think... I'm playing?""


By the GODS.  Did you keep that one hanging around since -SKYPIEA-?!  ""UGH--""  That thing reeks so bad, he can do little but try to wipe the rotten yolk off his face and gag, staggering around.  /SON/ of a --oh, did his kick land a blow?  Luffy recovers enough from a sharp sense of disgust at the rotten egg to see Usopp coughing blood, and so he flicks his fingers to one side, wipes it on the edge of his vest, and begins cracking his knuckles, laughing.

But dear gods, it still STINKS.  ""You -never- learn, do you.""  He tosses his head to regard Usopp with a downcast face and his glare veiled partially by yolk smeared hair.  ""Always using the same old pranks.  Never understanding where you stand.""  Luffy grimaces, then spits at the ground as he advances towards him, still working the joints of his fingers loose.  ""...You make me sick.""

Luffy stops, crouching on one bended knee in front of Usopp, reaching out to try to take hold of the marksman by his bandanna and hair, grinning down at him.  ""You can't -ever- win.  You didn't before, and you won't now.""

""I'm going to crush you.""  He raises a fist, his grin widening.  ""Gomu Gomu no...!""


Alabasta, actually. He got it from a nice lady in Alubarna the day before they left... Tamagoboshis get better with age! The laugh... well, Usopp isn't going to give himself away. As fas as he's concerned, everyone thinks that was really blood, not a ketchupboshi! Crouching slightly, he starts to stand up, only to find his hair and bandana grabbed and yanked. Owowowow!

""You think this is a joke? You think I'm playing around?"" His eyes narrow as Luffy pulls his fist back, hand quickly reaching into his bag. Now where is... ah! Here we go. 

""Usopp Special Attack!"" The arm comes up, putting a Dial right near Luffy's face. Not an Impact Dial though, not by the color. Something else... ""Flame Dial: Farenheit Four-Fifty-One!"" FWOOSH! A massive gout of fire sprays from the dial, the results of a kaenboshi gone wrong in the Ruined Crscent library recently. He knew saving that flame dial would come in handy...

Whether Luffy gets toasted or manages to dodge, Usopp reaches his free hand up to pull himself free, rolling away quickly. ""I can't win? I know you, Luffy, more than anyone you've ever fought! I know your strengths, and I know all your weaknesses!"" Didn't before? Usopp doesn't remember ever doing this before, but... no, he can't get distracted. Reaching into his bag, he pulls out a pair of earplugs, jamming them into his ears. ""USOPP NOISE!""

A small chalkboard is produced, and the marksman screeches his fingernails down it. ""Sheeeeeheeheeheeheehee! You know what the difference is between you and me?"" He doesn't need any fake appendages for this one. For an Arlong impersonation, he already has an appropriately-long nose.


THAT long ago?  That...explains a lot, but UGH!  Where do you keep something like that safe on the trip UP to Skypiea and back down again?!  Did you hide it in pillows?!  JEEZ.

Luffy's fingers are relentless, gripping hair and bandanna both to keep Usopp's head up and in easy reach for the punch he hopes to send crashing into his face--except what wipes his smug, superior grin right off his face is a blink at the exclamation (( Usopp Special Attack! )) that suggests to him this is something new.

He hates surprises, so as the Dial is raised to his face, he grabs his OWN hair and /pulls/ his head back just in time for the Dial to go off with a roar of flames.

At the near miss of a column of fire, he can feel the heat cause sweat to spring up on his skin and evaporate almost instantly, stinging him.  ""Sh-shit!""  Where the hell did you get THAT, marksman?!  In his shock, he releases his hold on Usopp, and he gets away.

...Only to assail his ears with that HORRIBLE SCREECHING.  Talk about headache inducing.  A singed, disheveled pirate claps his hands over his ears, and lowers them to try to strike out at him.  ""Gomu Gomu no...--huh?""

What's the difference?  He blinks again, bewildered.  ""...Noses?""


You'd be surprised what Usopp can carry around in that bag of his. While perhaps not quite as much of a dimensional storage area as Nami's cleavage, the bag seems able to hold quite a lot.

The fact that Luffy dodged the gout of flame doesn't bother Usopp much anyway, because it did save him from getting hit. Maybe Luffy will know not to underestimate him now, though!

Usopp continues to scratch his nails against the chalkboard, occasionally letting out a 'Sheeeheeheeheehee!' until Luffy asks his question. ""Don't be so--""

Blink. Usopp reaches a hand up and pushes the tip of his nose, bending it slightly. ""Actually... yeah. Pretty much.""


""....""  Luffy blinks at Usopp a few times, while he imitates the marksman by poking at the tip of his nose.

There is something important people must remember about the captain.  He's Darkened, but he's still Luffy, albeit one that was warped, twisted, and ultimately rather -insane-.  Although just about everything he does and says is colored by a sadist's dark humor, there is still a core of him that will react precisely as the Luffy they know will.

Which is why Luffy suddenly falls over.  LAUGHING.  ""NOSES!  AHAHAHAAHAHA!""

....Oh dear gods. -_-;  After a moment of rolling around in a fit of hysterical laughter, during which Usopp has time to prepare whatever else he has next, Luffy stops abruptly and sits up, holding up a finger.  ""...Hey, don't we have a fight to the death going on here or something?""

""....""  He instantly loses it to fury.  ""STOP DISTRACTING ME, YOU FUCKWIT! I'LL KILL YOU!""


In any other circumstance, Usopp might be joining the captain in laughing. But now.. he really is serious, in his own way. And while Luffy is rolling around laughing, Usopp runs along the beach, hand dipping into his bag. There has to be something else he can use before the mugiwara gets up... That's it!

Turning around, Usopp brings his hand slowly to his face, pressing it there for a moment. By the time Luffy is back on his feet, the marksman faces him and... isn't the marksman anymore!

Now when did Nami get here? And why is she wearing Usopp's clothes? ...And when did she have such a long nose? Well, at least the face (Besides the nose) looks like Nami's. What, you thought he threw that mask away?

""Luffy, you shouldn't be so mean to Usopp! He's a brave warrior!"" Okay, so the marksman's female impressions leave something to be desired. But hey, it worked for Foxy, so it might be worth a try now...


""--Na?""  No, it wasn't an aborted attempt to say 'Nami?', but really an inquisitive, confused noise.  At least the ridiculous disguise saps all the fury right out of the possessed captain, who stands up, staring.  "".....""

It really shouldn't take him that long to figure out it isn't her.  IDIOT.  But it might have actually worked, like all of Foxy's costumes worked, except he does what Luffy NEVER would have done.

He looks down.  Looks up.  Looks down, looks back up.  After verifying that, yes, the masked marksman does not have an impressive--*BRICKED* Ahem.  After verifying that the masked marksman is not otherwise visibly feminine, he, blank-faced, reaches out a hand and...takes hold of Usopp's nose.

""...Yeah right, if I were /desperate/, maybe.""

CRACK.


Dangit. That should have worked! Maybe if he had been wearing a Sanji or a Zoro mask. Or a Chopper one. As is, he flails as his nose is grabbed, swatting ineffectually at one of Luffy's arms. ""Oi, Luffy! Leggo by dose! Legg--AAAAH!"" 

Okay, it isn't the first time Usopp's nose has broken, it probably won't be the last, but that still -hurts-. One arm still flailing, the marksman reaches into his bag and pulls out another Dial. This one, though, isn't brought to Luffy's face. Instead, he presses it against the captain's side, just below the arm holding onto his nose. ""Axe Dial.""

A long time ago, when Zoro and Nami were first killed, Usopp wanted revenge. Not only revenge, but fitting revenge. And so, before setting the swordsman's katanas afloat with him, Usopp had taken an axe dial to all three of them. Now he's finally using one... not a normal Dial, but one full of meaning. And full of katana. ""Sandai Kitetsu."" The cursed sword, Third-Generation Demon-Splitter. ""Begone from our beloved captain!"" And we all know how well Luffy's body reacts to being cut.


All it took was a sharp jerk of his hand to one side, and now Luffy's letting go after he hears (and feels) the crack, wearing a look of such deep distaste that his disdain is heavy enough to be a blow of its own.  But Usopp?  He's probably used to people looking down on him, and he's a pirate.  They're used to the disdain of others.

He starts to look away, ""Tch.  I'm through messing with you.""  His knuckles crackle while he curls his fingers into a fist, bringing it up past his face and across to above the opposite shoulder, ready to end this with a single, crushing backhand--he blinks.  What's that on his side?  Luffy hesitates, and then looks down.

Luffy braces himself for impact.  Another Bazooka?  Pff.  He's sure it'll hurt, but that kind of damage he can get back up from, albeit in some lingering pain.  How many more of those do you have left?  ""Begone?""  He barks a harsh laugh, ""You can't tell me to get lost, you worthless--"" His head jerks forward, eyes wide.  There is a wet spatter beside him when he staggers.  ""GRKH!""

""Gh--""  A cough, and he brings his hands to his bleeding side, choking.  Well, sudden slashes to the side have a tendency to knock the wind out of you.  A few gasps, and he aims a burning glare at Usopp, half bowed over his wound.  ""...You... /dare/...!""

He is on him in seconds, bloodstreaked fingers closing around his neck as he bears down on him.  ""I've had it with you!  You want the truth?!""

""You wouldn't leave the Going Merry when it was BROKEN and DYING!  You said he was only USING IT, USING YOU, LIKE TOOLS.  Guess what?""  He breathes a laugh, almost coughing, and lowers his face towards Usopp's ear, ""You should've been saving that for me.  Instead...""  Blood is painting a warm path down his side, slowly soaking the denim.  ""...He chose to Forget, just because he wanted things the way they were.""

""That kind of sentiment... is utterly nauseating.  But if I kill /you/, with these two hands of his...""


At least it gives Usopp time to get the Nami mask off and put it away again. He'll need it later! ""Worthless?"" What, are you Crocodile now? The marksman reaches back into his bag, but has to bring his hands up again when Luffy tries to strangle him. This is painfully familiar... ""Gnkt...""

The truth? He can't handle the truth! Um. Apparently. Because Usopp's eyes go wide. ""Merry isn't dying! She isn't broken!"" But... he's right, in a way. ""Merry isn't a tool... and neither are we."" 

Kill you... Usopp's vision starts to fade a bit, but he can't give up now. This isn't Luffy. Luffy would hit, sure. Smash. But go for the kill by strangulation? No, never. So he feels no remorse in donig what he does next.

Hand dives into his bag and comes out with another dial. Two words are choked out, around the strangling fingers. ""Tone... Dial...."" And then it goes off. Bells. The sound of dozens of clocks of all shapes and sizes chiming at once, signalling noontime in a clock shop in Golden Hall. DONG! DONG! DONG!... 

Usopp had noticed over the past few days how Luffy would always cringe or hide whenever the clocktower went off. He only hopes he's right, because if he's wrong, it may be his final mistake.


Crocodile?  Hahaha!  Nope!  But pretty close; it's already been perhaps seen in parts here and there that what comprises Darkened Luffy are bits of all the people he hated and why he hated them.  Arlong's superiority, Crocodile's cold disdain, Bellamy's reliance on his strength alone... the list could go on and on.  At Usopp's denial, there's a chuckle cruel uttered when bloodied fingers tighten further around his throat.

""She is.  She's /dying/, Usopp.  Oh,"" he lifts his eyes to the sky, grinning wildly, ""Luffy had such /high hopes/.  'Let's go to Sky Island!'"" he lilts with a laugh that hurts the wound cut into his side, but this he ignores for now.  ""NEVER knowing that the trip ALONE would break her back!  Such innocent -intentions-, and he KILLED HER!  HE KILLED HER, USOPP.  Because he wanted to keep moving towards his -precious- dream!""

Tone... Dial?

Luffy's grin vanishes in favor of confusion.  And this suddenly to wide-eyed shock at the sound of... bells.  Clock bells.

In the Ruined Crescent, he spent gods know how long listening to the never-ending, maddening toll of a bell that would never fade.

He SCREAMS, releasing Usopp in order to scramble backwards away from the marksman and his dial, tripping twice in his panic.  When he runs out of space to back up on --his back against a pole of the docks-- he covers his head with his hands, hiding his face in his knees.

Well, uh.  That's certainly...um.  An extreme reaction.  Who can resist pushing the shiny, candylike red button?  Apparently not Usopp.


Yeah, that did the trick. DONG! Now that his throat is free, Usopp gets to his feet and advances on the cowering mugiwara. DONG! 

She's dying.. ""MERRY IS NOT DYING!"" DONG! Hand goes to bag, and the marksman pulls out his hammer. DONG! ""SHE'S JUST FINE!"" And on the next stroke of the clock, he brings the hammer down, hard as he can, onto Luffy's head. DONG! ""Merry is going to stay with us a long time and she WILL!"" Hammer smash. ""NOT!"" Hammer smash. ""DIE!"" Hammer WHAMWHAMWHAM!

DONG!

Hmmm. Must have hit a nerve on Usopp. He seems even angrier than when he began this fight, and the hammer doesn't seem to be enough. DONG! Back into the bag it goes, and Usopp draws out another dial. ""Axe Dial."" DONG!

""USOPP PAPERCUT!"" The dial is applied like before, only this one doesn't have a katana in it, and isn't released all at once. No, this time, Usopp moves it quickly, giving a series of very shallow papercut-like slashes. DONG! And he doesn't stop until the dial is completely empty of cuts.... DONG!

That's twelve bells ringing for those listening at home. No more on any clock...


He can hear Usopp's rebuttal, a screaming that doesn't quite cut into the way those tolling bells are ringing in his skull, inspiring a headache he's all too familiar with.  Every one of those tolls are becoming slowly the sound of that endless reverberation, that long, stretched-out and eternal toll of the bell in the Ruined Crescent, the one that drove people eventually mad at the sound of it for want of a moment of silence.

Many faded away, unable to endure.

The first strike knocks him forward, but it'll take more than that for someone made of -rubber-.  The second and third drop him to hands and knees, but still he doesn't move, doesn't defend himself.  The sound of bells have paralyzed him.  It seems the Darkened captain isn't even aware the blows are falling at all.

The last ring.

A hand snatches for Usopp's wrist, and the captain raises his head, a line of blood trailing down from his mouth where he'd bit the inside of his mouth, eyes narrowed and burning.  ""....Gomu Gomu no,"" Luffy utters lowly, drawing one arm lined with cuts back.

(( ...Heavy...! ))
(( That's what being a captain is! ))

He squeezes his eyes closed, but not on his own volition.  The Darkened captain would love nothing more than to see Usopp's expression.  Instead of the joy of victory, there's a searing prickle at the corner of his eyes.  His fist comes up hard towards Usopp's side as he pushes himself to his feet.

""BULLET.""


Like a light switch. As soon as the bells are through, Usopp glances at the Tone Dial, and his face falls. That was quicker than he expected... and so was Luffy's recovery! ""...Oi, Luffy!"" Usopp tries to pull his wrist free, even going so far as to pull out the hammer again and wham it down at the arm holding him. But if Arlong couldn't move Luffy's hand, then Usopp has no chance.

Bullet. The fist rams into his side hard, and that wet cracking sound means Chopper may be even busier later. Usopp coughs out blood, real blood this time, and doubles over. He tries to stand up again, several times, but each time only sinks lower. When he finally drops to the ground, the marksman can only look up, first toward Luffy, then toward the ship... and back to Luffy.

Elbaf, the land of the giants! Let's visit there someday!
Yeah, we'll definitely go there!

He tried... and he failed. And there was nothing more Usopp could do before blacking out.



Motionless, the Darkened captain stands there, eyes shut beneath his hair, as Usopp sinks gradually to the ground.  He mutters something low enough to have been missed by even the marksman, blood dripping from the soaked hem of his shirt.

(( You can't possibly win! ))

""I can't win.""

He stoops, scooping up the marksman in one arm and walking towards the ship, steps robotic, puppet-like.  In spite of his wounds, he simply throws the sniper to the deck without saying a word, and stops to pick up his straw hat.

Luffy almost hesitates again, with the straw hat in a hand poised over Usopp, fingers trembling.  But instead of dropping his hat into the sniper's care, he puts it on, striding down the gangplank and away from the Going Merry.

""Chopper.  Take care of him. I never want to see his face again.""


From the crow's nest, where he's been silently watching the proceedings, alternatedly shocked at Luffy and cheering in awe of Usopp, the little reindeer trembles, whether out of shock or fear, and waits for his cap--- no. Not his captain. Not Luffy either. Whatever that thing was, it wasn't Luffy. Or was... was it? Was that last statement ... No! He wouldn't think about it! 

After the Darkened captain leaves, the little reindeer quickly slides his way down the mast, hurrying to tend to Usopp. Not a word is said, as antiseptic, gauze, and bandages are applied, at least not until the main damage is done, and Chopper can sit back and watch the unconscious Usopp. ""... Hey Usopp... you won, didn't you? You won..."""

"event","It had been a storm that spawned the idea.  Luffy had seemed to be of his old, familiar humor all day; even though the rain continued to gray the sky and pelt cold and drenching in the world outside the Going Merry, he complained of things like boredom and hunger, when doodling on scrap paper or attempting to learn coin tricks no longer entertained the straw-hatted pirate.  Given his short attention span, this wasn't entirely uncharacteristic of him.

He'd proposed a big dinner to the crew, right inside the Going Merry.  The rain wouldn't dampen the spirits of real pirates, he'd claimed, laughing, so they'd throw a party to prove it.  Luffy even offered to go fetch the supplies himself.

It was a much more normal meal than any since they returned from the Ruined Crescent, except that there was no end to it.  Only an abrupt sense of disorientation, a loss of time, and nothing.

<s>Dark Luffy arranged Zoro and Rin's 'scandal' as part of his night's pranking.</s> <b>Cancelled by request.</b>

In a moment of clarity, Luffy attempted to stop himself from killing his last target, Nami, by dragging her outside of Bluefinger Port.  The storm stopped further progress, and when he realized that taking her away from her nakama would leave her even more vulnerable to an attack, brought her back to the Going Merry by daybreak.

The next day, everyone wakes up in their own beds with mild headaches and no evidence of the previous night immediately available.  The storm of the previous night has also passed."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Target: Chopper"">

Chopper will wake to the noxious smell of something held under his blue nose which, once the reindeer man begins to rouse, is corked shut, the small bottle of antidote pocketed.  The figure backs off into the shadows.

It's cold.  Outside, the world is a riot of crashing thunder and sheets of rain drumming relentlessly on the roof.  But this isn't the ship.  Everywhere is the smell of the blood of countless creatures, of butchered meat, the shadows cast by hanging tools of the trade tracing talon-like across the floor every time the lightning flashes. The diminutive doctor is currently locked in a cage, a thick loop of chain wound around him.

Welcome, Chopper, to the slaughterhouse.



          The little reindeer's eyes are glazed over as he sits up, bringing his hooves to his eyes. Or attempting to, anyway- the chain restrains him, which causes Chopper to perk up, struggling. ""What's going on?"" he asks, trying to shake his head clear of the cobwebs. 

          Chopper's gaze narrows, focuses, and blinks, before he turns his head to look at ... 

          Lighitng strikes, exposing a cow's head, eyes dulled over, tongue lollying out. 

          Giving a shriek, the little reindeer leaps back--- stopped by the chain, however, he ends up tumbling backwards, flat onto his back, hat settling over his eyes. 

          ... and everything goes dark again. Must be a bad dream, must be... But he had something on his face. And he couldn't move. Shaking his head to free himself from the hat on his face, he looks again with eyes that widen by the second... 

          ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!""




Somewhere in that darkness, there's a pirate who would be king, wearing a coat-like apron he found hanging on the wall.  It smells strongly of leather and the dead and dust.  He walked through pounding rain to get here, and for someone with as sensitive a nose as the small Chopper, such a coat would do perfectly for the job of masking the pirate's own scent.  The room itself would mask anything the coat neglected.

This Darkened captain is not more intelligent.  He only has the cunning of a predator.  A crueller kind of instinct that the captain normally put so much faith in.

The cow's head seems to move as the meager light leaking in through the windows begins to make it visible as eyes adjust to the dark.  Indeed; it's the captain moving it with hands behind its ears, his own voice a low growl beyond the blank-eyed corpse.  

""No one will hear you.""

""No one will save you.""

""No one cares.""




          The young reindeer didn't DARE to sniff the air- the salty-iron smell of blood floating in the air sickened him; not physically, but what it represented. Death, decay, all the things that a doctor fought off with needle and gauze, with scalpel and bandages, with antibiotics and tweezers. But there were things that even doctors couldn't fight off. 

          Murder. Genocide. 

          The Cow Head spoke, the blankheaded corpse moved, and the little reindeer trembled, tears welling up in his eyes, withdrawing as best as he could to the corner of the cage furthest away from the head, struggling with the chain around him. 

          The occasional flashes of lighting displays a tearful lost reindeer, one fighting to find words for this, even before he exclaims, ""You're lying!"" As the cry echoes through the blood-ladened air in the slaughter house, the reindeer presses up against the back of the cage, his little hooves struggling to find purchase against the floor. Tears flowing down his cheeks, he repeats again. ""You're lying! My nakama will find me! They'll find me!""



Every. Single. Time.

Nakama, nakama, nakama!  He is so sick of the word, disgusted that these people could be so WEAK as to rely on others to save them; that they could be so brash as to proclaim their weakness, time and time again!  It's nauseating, have they no shame?!

It's impossible to turn his feelings down, impossible to remain silent when his dark humor has been awakened; so instead the Cow Head seems to laugh.

""Am I?  Look around.""

""You have been abandoned here.""

""Don't you remember?""

""They didn't NEED you anymore.  Not when there are doctors capable of curing anything in Golden Hall.""

Someone had, after all, healed the extensive damage to a nakama's hands overnight before Chopper was found.  Did he even know?  ""Your fate will be the same as everyone else who has come here before you.""




         The little reindeer refused to turn his head to look, so sunken into the terror that he was. Hatless, chained, Chopper could only watch the Cow Head with wide fearful eyes, tears streaming. ""Noooo! Noooo!"" What could he say to that? What could... 

         The little reindeer's eyes falls on his precious beloved hat, and remains fixed there. 

         The hat. 

         There when Chopper rode on Usopp's shoulder. 

         There when Nojiko patted his head. 

         There so that he could push back his hat before running up to hug Nico Robin. 

         There when sitting to watch Zoro practice his swordsmanship. 

         There to push back out of the way while peering over Sanji's cooking pots. 

         There falling down his head while trying to help Nami pick tangerines. 

         There when everyone lifted their fists in the air in silent farewell to Vivi, led by their smiling laughing captain with the straw hat... 

         The little reindeer blinks back tears, and shakes his head. ""NOOOO! They need me! They'll always need me! They'll travel the world, they'll find the One Piece, and ... they'll need a doctor every step of the way! You're LYING!




Yes.  Drinking in the despair in Chopper's denial is making all the evening's efforts worthwhile.  There was always that moment, every time, where there was that look of horrible understanding, when he finally revealed himself.  Sometimes he had done it early, other times, it had been not until the end that he showed his true colors.  Oh, but every time, the response was beautiful.

""No?""

""NO?!""  And there is that laughter again, a sound of ringing, perverse amusement.

""Tell me why, then!"" roars the voice of the Cow Head--

--Before it suddenly is pitched aside into darkness and from behind it emerges probably the last person Chopper expected to see.  In a bloodstained coat, hair wild beneath his straw hat, it wouldn't be a manic smile alone to leave one with the impression he was thoroughly insane.

""WHY AM I HERE, Chopper.""



          Struggling to find a way free from his bonds, the little reindeer inhales. Heavy Point? Small tight chains and cage- it'd be bound to hurt a lot, painfully so. He'd have to get out! To get away from this... this slaughterhouse, this carnage, the... 

          ""Luffy?"" 

          ... captain? 

          ""... what are you doing here? Get me out of the cage, Luffy! Get me out!""



After revealing himself, Luffy strolls around the cage in a wide circle, face turned down, straw hat unable to completely conceal a thin smile illuminated against a flash of lightning.  As he crosses behind the cage, he picks up the cow's head and puts it right on top of the cage with a dull, heavy thud.  When he finally comes around full circle, he's swinging a heavy hammer by its long haft, cutting in while Chopper's pleading for his freedom.

""--Do you know what this is for?"" he asks pleasantly, almost conversationally, hefting it in one hand to look up at the hammer's head.  It's caked with something dark.  A low chuckle, and then: ""Before they bring one of these stupid beasts in for chopping up, they give them a little tap.""  His other hand comes up and touches a finger to his forehead.

""Right --HERE!""  He wheels around, raising the hammer over his head.  He brings it down on the cage with a horrible grin.  It crashes into the head that had been placed on the cage, and with a blow fueled with the captain's strength...

The mess is considerable.



          The little reindeer falls quiet as the hammer is brought out. Watching it with wide eyes, warily, Chopper's gaze widens as he lifts his head upwards towards where the cow's head is placed, and then he lowers his head just in time to see Luffy's hammer descend... ""LUFFY, NOOOOO!"" 

          Blood and brains, rotting muscle and splattered skin coats the little reindeer, even as he squieezes his eyes shut. And then slowly he opens his eyes, the no-longer blue nose twitching, as Chopper's gaze takes in the blood and brains everywhere, one bovine eyeball dangling on a bundled nerve string from an antler. And the reindeer's eyes widen, and he screams, incoherently. And then animal instinct takes over, and the little reindeer is on his feet, headbutting the cage, trying to get out, his little antlers taking the brunt of it. The momentum of the headbutt causes the cage to swing wildly... 

          ""LEMMMEOUTLEMMEOUTLEMMEOUTLEMMEOUTLEMMEOUTLEMMEOUTLEMMMEEEEEEEOUUUUUUUUUUUTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!""



""HOME RUN!"" cackles the pirate, tugging the hammer free and whipping it spinning off into the darkness of the corner, where it crashes into something and clatters to the floor.  He laughs.  He laughs even while the cage is struck to swinging from Chopper's attempts to be free, while Luffy steps away to pull an axe from the wall.

Something like this is archaic, no?  But it's meant to sever heads on larger creatures, much like that cow.

This, he swings down at the cage, to imbed the edge in the top corner, ""SHUT UP!""  Now there's another risk to changing forms: Changing to a larger form might wind up with that sharp edge cutting into flesh, now that it's jutting into the roof of the cage he's trapped in.  The captain brushes a hand on the back of the coat, pulling out a cloth from his other pocket.  It carries a chemical smell.

""You should know better.  I'm not letting you out until you're dead.""



          THUDTHUDTHUD. ""LEMMEOUTLEMMEOUTLEMMEOUTLEMMEOUTLEMMEOUTLEMMMMEEEEEOUUUUUTTTT!"" 

          The little reindeer is too far gone in panic and rage as he continues to thud his head against the cage, the prison rattling and swinging wildly, as the joints and the hinges rattle alarmingly. The antlers are taking a great deal of the brunt of damage, and something's got to give soon!



One hand (holding the drug-laden kerchief) slams against the cage, holding it abruptly still, while his other hand reaches into the cage to seize at one of Chopper's antlers and -drag- him roughly towards the kerchief, intent on holding his face against it until his panicked breathing has the drug working its way through his system.

Enough of this game.  It's time to sleep, and it's time for Luffy to work on cleaning this up so there is no evidence that all this had been anything more than a terrible dream.




          The little reindeer's thrashing slows down, as Chopper's eyes glare wildly, foam erupting about his lips as he struggles against the handkerchief, until slowly, slowly, his breathing becomes slow, steady... 

          And as the little reindeer's body slump down against the floor of the cage, the last thing Chopper sees is ... Luffy..."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Target: Merry"">

Merry would awake to the sharp, poisonous smell of some chemical waved under her nose, from a bottle that is quickly spirited away into a pocket of the dark-coated figure standing over her.  Or perhaps it's just a heavy canvas, rendered in shadow by the low light flung by a solitary lantern and what flashes of light from the thunderstorm outside comes in through the porthole window.

It's one of the storage rooms of the Going Merry.  ""...If you disappear,"" someone whispers, ""Usopp will die.""  Good morning, Merry.



Merry didn't really keep track of events. Sure, she'd heard a whisper or two that Luffy was acting strangely, but when wasn't he? It was surely nothing that would linger, and everything would return to the way it was before. Her abusing her usual 'out of sight out of mind' method of working when nobody else was around generally kept her from being underfoot, which meant she didn't often get embroiled in her nakama's occasional scuffles or luffy's cries of boredom. But who could turn down a feast? Nothing could keep them down for long, especially not some stupid weather.

But time isn't supposed to blur together like that. Hours - minutes? - it shouldn't go by that fast, without recollection of what happened or where she was. She wakes gagging and disoriented, as many others probably have or will this night, thinking curses she never voiced for fear of upsetting niisan and trying to get a grip on what happened. Things that smelled like THAT shouldn't be onboard, it smelled like poison. ""Wha-?"" If you dissapear..

The small pirate doesn't vanish as soon as she realizes someone's there, someone who had to be if they could whisper such terrible words. It's not a good morning. Someone was on their ship, and it was a bad thing. She only realizes she's tied when she moves to try to wipe her face with one hand, and pauses. Tugs a bit. It wouldn't take more than a thought to escape. Except if she did, what would happen to Usopp? Bluff or not, Merry ... wouldn't take the chance, only giving a quiet, unhappy sound that might be fear or anger or both.



There is no purpose to this.  No rhyme, no reason, no method to this madness.  Only one cruel heart's desire to see fear in the eyes of others, to inflict on those most precious to another the pain of betrayal and introduce them to darkest depths of despair.  So far, his favorite has been the inevitable denial.  Oh no!  Luffy would NEVER do this!  It cannot be!

Ha ha ha. But wasn't it a surprise to see the Straw Hat Captain's own smile at their discomfort.  The realization that they'd been wrong and perhaps Knives had been right.  The question of 'This is impossible, is it a dream?' was one he hoped to rely on as his alibi to continue the game another night, perhaps.

The vial?  Smells horrible, didn't it?  It's the drug's only olfactory antidote other than simply sleeping it off, if only because it smelled so particularly VILE it would wake up anyone with a clear nose.

Lighting flashes.  And in the flickering lamplight, a lance - well, more a spear, really - is lowered until the point of the blade is aiming unwaveringly at the girl's nose.  ""That's right.  Usopp.  Your precious niisan.  He's locked up, where you can't find him.  But what do you care?  You just showed up one day, after all.""



At least Merry was a touch more practical. She got very uneasy around their captain whenever he started getting really worked up about something, since inevitably SOMETHING onboard would be destroyed. She trusted him, absolutely, but knew very well that he could be very destructive, without a care for his surroundings. More often than not, the small pirate was -in- those surroundings, watching and waiting. Today would have been no different.

Except that she's tied up in a room she recognizes quite well, held at spearpoint and told that Usopp was in danger. There were many brave people on their ship, Sanji, Zoro, Luffy.. she wasn't quite among their number. And she's most definitely afraid, dark eyes wide, attempting to inch away from that weapon and not really getting all that far. ""I'll find him."" Little more than a whisper with wavering voice, uncertain. What could she do? She had to do something! ""You leave Usopp alone, or I'll.."" Do something horrible!

The whole situation was /wrong/, Luffy shouldn't be here pointing a weapon at her, saying things like that. It wasn't *normal*. Not impossible but definitely strange and very unwelcome.



Luffy is normally wreckless, unaware that his destructive behavior usually left others with more of a mess to clean up -- in the case of the Going Merry, it was his enthusiasm to get to Skypiea that broke the 'back' of the ship, ironically enough.  Forgive him for being ignorant, Merry; his intentions were good, but his foresight was lacking.

The Captain here, however, is well aware that his destructive behavior has negative consequences.  He may not know of Merry's true nature, but he does know she has an investment in this ship, and in the ship's Handyman/Inventor/Professional Liar/Sniper, Usopp.  How could he miss the terms of endearment?  It was /sickening/.  What a glaring weakness for someone who already struck him as terribly weak.  Usop would outlive his usefulness eventually.  But Merry... no, she had power that he didn't have.  THAT was useful.

Still didn't spare her from his cruelty.

All of it was wrong.  All of the days since Luffy woke up after dying in Ruined Crescent have been wrong.  Sure a few times he seemed normal, but under it all was an underlying sense of corruption.  It's too bad that the crew may have started noticing this too late.  Even if she gains an inch of distance, he brings that spear head ever closer, grinning beneath the canvas makeshift cloak he'd worn to ward off the pelting rain.

""No, you won't.  You /can't/.  He isn't here.  And you can't do anything to save him.  What do you think of that?""



Oh, there was no mistaking that the small horned pirate had a lot invested in the ship, hours of work and more. It took time to try, and sometimes succeed, sometimes fail, to repair the damage done to the ship, but she was up to the challenge, she'd try hard for her nakama because they tried hard for her. They gave her a home, that at the least she couldn't turn her back on. ""I-I'll find him."" It doesn't occur to her that if Luffy's -here- and terrifying her mindless that he can't be somewhere else preparing to kill Usopp. These kinds of logic jumps take a bit too much thought right now.

""Why are you doing this? Leave me alone! I never did anything to you!"" She can try for defiance, but it inevitably falls flat in favor of tugging at her bindings, trying to find a way out of them *without* dissapearing. Something was wrong, and she wasn't quite sure what. Maybe she repaired something wrong, or moved something she wasn't supposed to - Luffy wasn't LIKE this, he wasn't /mean/. ""A-and leave niisan alone too! Pick on someone your own size!"" Not like her, for example, she's small.

And frantically trying to figure out how to get out of this situation. She /hated/ spears, and he had one pointed at her and why couldn't she get rid of the feeling that it wasn't all for show? Usopp..where are you?



That's the beauty of innocence, too.  The naive are so easily manipulated--this, Luffy himself would know quite well, even if he never seemed to learn his lesson.  The young can be easily frightened once they're aware that anything in their world is transient and therefore they've learned to be afraid of the threat of loss.  It's that same fear (( It's time to lose -everything- )) he's trying to inspire now.

""Leave me alone,"" whines the cloaked pirate with the spear, water still rolling off the hem and dripping on the floor.  ""Don't make me laugh!"" sharply hisses he, ""This is a WARNING.  Keep yourself useful and know who it is you serve!  It is -always- those stronger than you.""

...How many others had they heard say those same words?  How many of those did they meet, so secure in their own strength, and how many of those were defeated by the Straw Hat Pirates, who proved that strength alone will not bring you happiness and victory?

""I will teach you, and Usopp, and EVERYONE ELSE this lesson until you LEARN.""  His voice is a vicious growl, and now he raises the spear, as if to hurl it down on the girl.



It was rare that she heard such things herself. Those epic battles, they were usually fought on foreign land, in another's territory, and always her nakama would come back bloody and injured but victorious, and she learned that it wasn't strength that made someone important, or better. Merry had long ago learned what true strength was, and it wasn't the power to hold a spear on a child and hiss words of threat to their loved ones. It does nothing at all to ease her fear. ""/No!/ That's not how it works!"" They didn't serve anyone, they were pirates, and the only thing that held their crew together was family, not someone's orders and commands and threats. She knew it, *knew* it as surely as she could feel the rock of the ship and smell the sea, and knew above all else that Luffy was the one who protected that freedom with every breath he took.

And here he was denying it. Becoming everyone they've fought. It's Arlong's teeth in that smile, Crocodile's mocking laughter in those venomous words, a hundred defeated enemies who claimed might made right wearing Luffy's form and speaking through his voice. Merry recoils when the spear is lifted, tears flooding her eyes and terror keeping her from fleeing or phasing right out of physicality.

""We don't serve you! We don't serve anyone! We're PIRATES! You're not s-stronger than anybody if - if all you can do is bully people! T-that just means that someone's gonna kick your ass!"" But who'll do that, when Luffy's usually the one handing out those well-deserved ass-kickings? Who'll do that now?



Isn't that what courage is?

The ability to act in spite of fear?

There are a lot of people in the world who could learn a thing or two from Merry and her 'niisan'.

But from the mouths of babes, right?  Indeed, she observes well; in this twisted personality that came out of the Ruined Crescent, there is a piece of every hated pirate they have ever met.  Crocodile's cold-hearted cruelty, Arlong's arrogance--the list could go on and on.  Everything that has inspired Luffy to say 'I hate it' about another pirate; that's what he became, another where, another when.

He would do anything to protect the ability of his nakama to chase their dreams, to breathe that kind of freedom until it threaded itself through every moment of their lives.  But as he is now?  Is that truly gone?

""That kind of naive bullshit is -exactly- what I hate about you people,"" he growls lowly, teeth gritted.  The spear is lowered in a jab that stops--

--just inches from her.  ""I overheard something the other day.  It's your watch, next Saturday.""

There is a pause, and outside the rain and thunder rail against the port as if appalled it were there.  ""...If you're a good girl, maybe Usopp -won't- get another ship, like he said.  Maybe we'll come back, instead of leaving you with this piece of junk to rot in the docks.""



Somehow, Merry manages to not scream when Luffy strikes, trying to curl as far away from the point as possible with a small strangled noise of fear - only to have it stop a very short distance away. When actually tangible, she's hurt as easy as anyone else, and that weapon could do a lot of damage. Only slowly does she uncurl a bit, to stare at the spear-point with wide, wide eyes, and then raise her gaze to Luffy himself. She doesn't bother to try to not shake like a twig in a hurricane, what was the point?

It might seem strange that her unease grows when Luffy speaks again, his words innocent enough seeming. But they strike hard and strike deep like no weapon ever could, and the small pirate shakes her head quickly, tears welling up again. Watches were bad enough, when it was just her alone, and nobody else there to pass the time or help her forget times where the ship had been tethered to a dock for days without any sign of her nakama, never knowing when they were coming back .. /if/ they were coming back.

The Going Merry was not really all that large or designed for pirates' adventures. Neither was Merry herself, whether or not she could breathe water or repair ships or turn intangible at will. Sooner or later the crew might realize that. And do just what Luffy was insinuating.

And leave it behind. And her with it.

""Usopp wouldn't ever get another ship,"" comes the quiet, mortified whisper, but the conviction behind it is terribly broken, isn't it? ""He'll come back. He's nakama. This place is our home. Everyone will come back here. We don't need a new ship. I-I've been fixing the damage, it's, it's getting better, we don't need another one..""



It's hard to see, but beneath that hood still shedding droplets of rainwater, the pirate captain smiles a grin manic at the quaking girl.  His shoulders start to shake in suppressed laughter at the distress his casually spoken information causes, and he doesn't bother holding it in when she protests in a whisper.  ""HAHAHA--IDIOT!  Do you really think any of us care about you?  Don't forget, brat, you snuck onto OUR ship, and this piece of crap has long since outlived its usefulness.""

""Why do you think we've been at the shore for so long, hm?""

True - they've been by Golden Hall and now in Bluefinger Port for a while now.  ""All those trips out into town.  Sure, we tried to keep this heap of lumber afloat this long, but after we saved it from those zombies, we figured it wasn't worth keeping around.""

""Maybe,"" Luffy says lowly, ""We'll just scrap it.  And it's not like someone so small could -possibly- learn how to care for a bigger ship in time, so...""  Your days here are numbered, he seems to be implying.  He lifts away the spear and slings it onto his shoulder.  ""Don't worry. Maybe if you're good enough, we'll think of taking you with us.""




Merry flinches as if he'd hit her, instead of simply spoken. The time that's passed hasn't gotten rid of that fear any, with the crew in one place, all on the Going Merry and occasionally bringing new friends with them. She knows the ship is mortally wounded and that even she can't repair the damage ... but dammit, she was trying as hard as she could! No matter how hard it was, she'd keep trying. Even if nobody onboard knew or cared, except for Usopp, it didn't matter. He tried as hard as she did to make everything work. ""It's not a piece of crap."" It's not a warship, it it still stayed afloat! It still survived storms!

It could still be useable, could still take its crew on adventures even if it's damaged, could still work as hard as they worked to keep going. She shakes her head mutely to Luffy's words, straining at the ropes binding her again - Merry's no weakling, even for someone many years older than her, but wriggling out of those ropes is going to be hard. She tries anyway. It wasn't true, they wouldn't abandon the ship, wouldn't take it apart and sell it for bits, or leave her behind just because she was small. She might be small (they both were, ship and shipwright), but she could do more than most people twice her size.

She could. She knew it. If she had the chance, she could do almost anything. ""I .. don't want to be left behind.."" They wouldn't. Would they? Usopp wouldn't, surely.




The spear is lifted -off- his shoulder, and instead of being swung at the girl, Luffy only stoically places it against the wall of the storage room.  

""It is!  It's garbage.  Better shipwrights than yourself verified it!  Stop fooling yourself, brat!""  Luffy says, in full confidence.  ""This ship is just waiting to sink.  It'd be better used as firewood!  Give it UP, Merry!""  This ship isn't worth fixing.  (( It's time to say goodbye to the Going Merry. ))

He puts a hand into the makeshift rain cloak he's wearing, coming out with a folded wad of cloth that he's pointedly making and effort not to breathe near.  This he puts up near Merry's face.

The last thing Merry will hear is the captain's strange murmur.

""No.  No one ever wants to be left behind.""  The cloth is kept up against nose and mouth, soaked with the vaporous version of the sedative that had been put in their food.  ""But that's never stopped anyone.""



""You're wrong! Why are you doing this?"" One child's wail of defiance and misery won't change anything, though Merry can't help her reactions. The ship was worth fixing, and she could do it if she had enough time, even if it was impossible. She didn't care who said everything was broken. She just wanted to stay with her nakama. 

What if they did decide to abandon her? Get a bigger ship, something fancier and newer, something without the battle damage and familiar lines, something that could be intimidating on the seas. What if Usopp went too? Where would she be then?

Merry struggles when Luffy pulls out the foul-scented cloth, but it doesn't last long even as she hears what's said and wishes fervently that it wasn't true. All too soon, she's still and quiet again."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Target: Nico Robin"">

It would be the unlit Women's Quarters of the ship that Nico Robin would wake to the reek of some poisonous-smelling contents of a small vial held in the captain's hand.  A bottle that, being the sedative's only vaporous antidote (aside from sleeping the medicine's course through), is quickly corked and placed in a pocket.  There is only one lantern lit.

""You had me worried for a minute there, Robin.""




         It was nice to finally be back aboard the ship after her week-long excursion to the city of Middleton. While the visit to the Sensorum had been enlightening, Robin had come to miss the Going Merry, as well as the rambunctious crew that lived aboard it. There were few things that the woman missed; one had to let go of a lot of things when they were on the run from the World Government. 

         The feeling was unusual. Robin wasn't accustomed to longing for things--especially not other people--but it seemed as though the Straw Hat Pirates had a strange effect on her. She had changed in her time with them, so muchso that even /she/ had noticed the metamorphosis. 

         Whatever did she do before them? 

         Drunk on this emotion, she spent the evening amongst the other pirates. Not reading or studying diligently aboard the deck of the ship (as she often did), but listening to them, speaking with them, and eating a meal with them (instead of alone in the company of a book). 

         The lantern hits lidded eyes, and her brows twitch. Slowly, yet surely, her eyes flutter open to an extended lantern and Luffy's face. She sits up and blinked, eyes adjusting to this new light. ""Mr. Captain, did I fall asleep at dinner?"" 

         Robin didn't often drink, but she did know her limits. And never did she expect a few cups of wine at dinner to render her unconcious. But here she lay, and that was the only plausible solution.




It didn't matter how long Robin was gone.  If anything, this meant another person who wouldn't be swayed by any attempts at interfering that Knives might do despite the threat to Nojiko's life.  If anything, this meant one less person to aim false smiles at and be suspicious of whether or not they could see through them.  It meant one more person who would eventually return home and learn their place is, like she had served Crocodile--or not.  She betrayed him, didn't she?  He was no longer useful to her aims, she no longer useful to his.

She would, therefore, be something to worry about.

Unless he found a way to give her no more aim to serve but the Straw Hat Pirates.

It lies in a heavy canvas bag at his feet.  ""You don't remember?"" he asks incredulously.  In the low light, Luffy glances aside, scratching beneath his scar with one finger, making a worried noise.  ""That was three days ago, Robin.  We left the next day and found out the storm washed a huge stone to shore.""

""Robin, we... found a Rio Poneglyph.""




         The calm and collected mask that Robin so often wears is torn free of her face. Surprise, and maybe even a hint of excitement lights up the historian's face. What? She almost can't believe it when she hears it. How in the world could she have possibly forgotten something so crucial, so essential to her being? She had spent the past two decades searching for it, and here it was, found not on Raftel, but on some far and distant world. 

         How could she find it and forget? 

         Robin regains her lost composition, pushing her eagerness behind a pallid smile. ""Where is it?"" Certainly, if she cannot remember what was scribed on the stone, she needs to see it again and retranslate the history she so adamantly searched for. 

         Finally, her quest was over.



Just wait - it all gets worse, so much more horrible.  And then, when she's heard it all, will she blame herself for 'forgetting', as Luffy claims she has?  How could she find it and forget?  Let him explain -everything-.  Luffy pulls off his straw hat, his expression solemn in spite of the way his fingers seem to be doing all the fretting for him, but... for such a good news as (( we... found a Rion Poneglyph ))?  How strange.

""It was just a mile from Golden Hall.""

Luffy's eyes are downcast.  ""But--""  He looks up abruptly, ""Crocodile showed up!""  Oh, gods, he does not know how close to real truth he is, ""I don't know how he got here, or how he -survived--""  Again, one of those horrible pauses.

""...You really don't remember?""
         



         Robin can't help but notice the youth's expression. Luffy had a tendency to get excited over the smallest of things, like fantastic storms and unusual animals and new games. But why was he not excited about this fantastic discovery? Why was he so solemn? Worry scrambles across the woman's face, across furrowed brow and thoughtful frown. Just a mile from the city? Where had it been hidden? Why hadn't they searched there before? How did they come upon it? A thousand questions sprout from her mind, but none slip from her lips. She has no answers, but she hopes to find them in Luffy's words. 

         /But/. There was always a /but/, wasn't there? Her life was littered with them. Seemingly all good occurences came with that tiny conjunction. And they always, /always/ brought bad news. 

         Crocodile. She clentches her fist at the mention of the name. What did he have to do with it? Was he hoping to find Pluton written on that rock? He could not translate it without her, and even if he was she had no intention of divulging its location. 

         ""I don't.""




He -should- be all but VIBRATING with enthusiasm, all but sparkling at the idea that the wild storm they partied through dug up a Poneglyph--one of the things his very own beloved nakama was searching for!  But instead, he seems he's hesitant, worried, holding back as if he were the messenger for some very dire news indeed.  It's bad business, breaking news that might shatter someone's dream.  In fact, the Darkened captain is doing so good a job with this deception because most of the feigned discomfort is leeched from a very -real- sense of distress at the whole mess this evening has become.  Not that he's aware the fragment of his host has anything to do with it.

""....""

Luffy seems to steel himself.  ""Crocodile showed up.""  But this he already mentioned.  Perhaps, this too is part of his preparing himself to deliver this news.  ""He wanted you back in Baroque Works.  Said he'd make you.  But I don't give up on my nakama.""  A firm nod.  ""...There was a big fight.  Zoro protected you; he's being taken care of by Chopper right now.""

Thunder growls outside, and the rain continues to pelt on the Going Merry.

The captain puts back on his straw hat, stooping to pluck at the open end of the bag on the floor.  There is the sound of something like gravel within.  ""...I'm sorry.  We couldn't save it.""



         And it's Luffy's troubled expression that worries her the most. It's out-of-the-ordinary and her mind quickly spirals into an endless rush of ""what ifs"" that'll only be restrained with Luffy's words. But as the boy continues to speak, the possibilities become darker, bleaker. The tiny shard of hope that still existed within her fades, blanketed by those endless dismal thoughts. 

         He wanted her back? He would not have her. Not for anything. If he planned on holding the Rio Poneglyph captive until she agreed to work at his side again, she would find some other way to acquire that history. She would have it, no matter what the consequences. Not even Crocodile would be able to stop her now. 

         But it seems that reality is worse than anything Nico Robin could have imagined. The sound of gravel against hardwood floor seems to resonate for an eternity. It's only then that Luffy's words finally sink in. 

         Luffy has perhaps seen it twice. Once, when he saved the woman from her living tomb in Arabasta. And then, when she confronted the military commander, Ao Kiji. A complete lapse of facial control. 

         Her eyes widen, painted a shade lighter than usual. Shock is her initial reaction. 

         But once she fully absorbs the youth's words, the shock is pushed aside in lieu of an even stronger emotion: anger. 

         Brows furrow and teeth grind into a frown. Wordlessly, she rips the covers off of her and steps out of bed. Nevermind that she is barefoot and only in pajamas, she is already headed for the door. 

         Twenty years of her life, all dashed in one moment. The dream she had so earnestly pursued for two decades, gone. The history her parents searched for till the end of their lives, vanquished. Her reason for being, eradicated. 

         She will not stand for this. Even if it means her life... 

         Crocodile will die tonight.



Even in this dim light, when it touches something so close, so near and dear to her heart as her own dreams realized and then suddenly dashed into hopelessness, he can see that bleak despair take hold in the oft-composed face of Nico Robin.

He could laugh aloud in victory, but that'd ruin everything.  Instead, he only picks at the bag, frowning.

In the midst of his cruel triumph, he realizes an error that could cost him dearly, if it reveals his lie too soon.  She might leave, verify that not a single day has passed, and then he'd have to deal with an angered, distressed Nico Robin and her Devil Fruit power.

""WAIT!""  Luffy cries, throwing himself in the way with arms outstretched.  ""Where are you going?  Crocodile's gone!  We couldn't save the Poneglyph, but at least we got some of it!""



         But the anger doesn't subside, even as Luffy throws himself between the historian and the door. The few feelings that manage to push through her thick emotional barrier are always difficult for even this halcyon woman to control. But before she can press forward, words slip from the boy's lips. Crocodile is gone? They have some of the Poneglyph? She had heard the sound of gravel against the hardwood of the ship, but those were all pieces, weren't they? But even a portion of the legendary Rio Poneglyph was better than none. 

         But despite that bit of reassurance, she would not forgive the Suna Suna Fruit user. 

         Not now. Not ever. 

         ""Where is he?"" she demands, spitting the words out as if they were chews of a rotten apple.



""Faded.  Gone.  Hoatzin...""  Luffy's words cut out as if his throat had closed on them due to frustration; the way his fists clench would suggest it, but the truth of it lies in that he can't even produce a lie about the god chattering inside his skull.  That endless babbling of the small god reaches only indignantly teeth-rattling levels when he attempts it, and there's something to be said of an angry god.

However, this can only lead one to assume Hoatzin had told his Priest something.

Perhaps he's taken this too far.  He's gotten what he wanted - her despair - and now..?  He pulls a folded cloth from his back pocket, moving to her side.  ""There might be another one, Robin.  ...You haven't given up hope on your dream, have you?""

Depending on her answer, he has a gift ready on hand already.



         Gone. Faded. Even if she has to return to the Grand Line to exert justice on the man, she will do so. For this, she cannot forgive him. Just as she was unable to forgive Yama for destroying the ruins of Skypiea, she cannot absolve Crocodile of his crime. This is an even greater sin. Cities can be rebuilt, book can be replaced, but the True History cannot. On it is the only record of the Century of Emptiness, the famous Lost Years of History. Because she was the only one who could read it, she was able to continue living, even in the most dismal of times. 

         There will be other poneglyphs. Poneglyphs of clues and poneglyphs of knowledge. But none will contain that lost history. Her hopes of finding and recording the True History are all gone. 

         ""No..."" She clentches her fist. Giving up is simply what Crocodile wants, does he not? She will not give him the pleasure...!



(( No... ))

Luffy's head turns away, downcast.  Beneath the shadow of his hair, he bares his teeth in a thin grimace; something like a grin.  ""....That's.... too bad.""  He turns, stepping in right behind the archaeologist, hooking an arm around the front of her neck and tugging her backwards in one smooth, quick gesture.  A cloth held in the other hand is brought up to cover mouth and nose within half a second after.

It is soaked with a breathable sedative of the same strength that was laced in her food.

It's time to make this all a dream again, all a bad dream.




         What...?! 

         Robin has never been the sort of woman to go down without a struggle. So when the youth brings the handkerchief to her face and the bitter odor of the poison fills her breath, reflexively, she moves to escape. Hands lunge for his arms, trying to pull Luffy away, though the effort diminishes with every second that passes. Where most would cry out, she bites back breath to last a little longer, but she's already seemingly failing. Her strength is falling. 

         Two more arms slowly shift from her the joint of her inner arm, struggling to tug herself loose of the boy who would be called pirate king.




Struggling?  Won't go down without a good fight, then?  For a moment, Luffy's smile becomes manic; he could make this so much worse.  A quick punch to the kidneys could leave her breathless from pain, or even a simple throw to the floor could knock the breath from her lungs and force her to inhale the sedative...

...but either method risks marks and bruises that would leave uncomfortable questions to answer the next day, and when he means to have all this appear to be some strange nightmare -- to get in his laughs, so to speak, without risking them all coming down on his head and removing him (somehow) from the body he hopes to keep for a long time yet.

It takes a lot of effort to keep from being pried off, but he's patient.  ""There there,"" he cajoles in a low tone, in mock-affection.  ""Just a little longer.""  Breathe.  Until he can feel those limbs go heavy from sleep.  ""You should've said yes.""



         What... is going on? 

         Aqua eyes frantically search for some escape, only to find none. But even a devil fruit user cannot live without air for very long. As time progresses, Robin finds herself gasping for the air she so desperately struggled not to inhale. The two additional appendages she shifted only moments before sink back into her arms, and then, even her own hands fall to her waist. 

         Luffy... 

         Robin strains to keep her eyes open. But in time, like the rest of her body, her lids grow heavy and sink closed. 

         Nico Robin has fallen."

It had been a storm that spawned the idea.  Luffy had seemed to be of his old, familiar humor all day; even though the rain continued to gray the sky and pelt cold and drenching in the world outside the Going Merry, he complained of things like boredom and hunger, when doodling on scrap paper or attempting to learn coin tricks no longer entertained the straw-hatted pirate.  Given his short attention span, this wasn't entirely uncharacteristic of him.

He'd proposed a big dinner to the crew, right inside the Going Merry.  The rain wouldn't dampen the spirits of real pirates, he'd claimed, laughing, so they'd throw a party to prove it.  Luffy even offered to go fetch the supplies himself.

It was a much more normal meal than any since they returned from the Ruined Crescent, except that there was no end to it.  Only an abrupt sense of disorientation, a loss of time, and nothing.

Thunder is crashing overhead.  The rain pounds furiously on the deck in scattered sheets.  There is a sharp, poisonous smell from a small bottle held up to Usopp's nose, a whiff of the sedative's own olfactory antidote, and this is corked and spirited away.

The first thing he is likely to discover is that he's lying on something cold and hard, like a coffin of ceramic.  The next is that his limbs are immobilized.  Usopp?  Is currently weighed down at wrists and ankles by Zoro's own training weights and ropes in one of the most unlikely places to wake up in.  The bathroom -- or more specifically, the unfilled bathtub.



Ah yes, it was a fun time. Usopp even got to the third chorus of the Praises to Captain Usopp song number 294 before passing out. Strange dreams haunted him in that sleep, horrible nightmares filled with dark, twisted versions of Kuro, Chuu, Daddy the Father, Eyelashes, Mr. 4, and Miss Merry Christmas, with Brogy looming overhead. Horrible. But still, only a dream, and when the strange scent is waved under his nose, the marksman snaps awake. ""What? Where?"" Blink. This isn't his hammock. And it isn't the table he remembers last being at.

""How'd I get here?"" It isn't until Usopp tries to reach up and scratch his head that he realizes he can't lift his arms. Or move his legs. Or... anything, really. ""Oi! What's going on? Chopper, this had better not be one of your jokes!""



The usual light isn't on.  Instead, there's an indirect, flickering light, golden; it comes from a storm lantern left sitting on the floor, and casts a strange, tilted light to everything, including the form of a figure who would be made unfamiliar in such light were it not for the presence of a straw hat.

""I wouldn't bother.""  Unmistakeable: The voice is Luffy's, but again, there's something 'off' about it.  It carries not a hint of the familiar, guileless good humor it -should- possess.  ""None of them can hear you.""

Thunder again.  Overhead.  It's only the safety of Bluefinger's harbor that keeps the ship from rocking on waves that would have surged in such weather.  He leans forward, half his face illuminated as he looks in at Usopp, and calmly reaches for the tap.

""I thought I'd show you something.  You're so -weak-,"" he adds quietly, smiling, ""That I'm sure you've wondered what it's like to have eaten a Devil Fruit.""

""Here, I'll show you.""  With a metallic squeak, the tap is opened, and water - cold - begins to spill from the faucet into the bathtub.  Apparently relaxed, he crosses his arms over the edge of the tub and rests his chin on them, grinning.  ""I mean, 'hammer in the water'?  It really feels like that, you know.  Your limbs don't move right.  You can't breathe.  You have to rely on someone -else- to save you.""



Nobody's answering him.. time to pani--no, wait. ""Luffy! Come get these things off... my..."" Usopp turns his head slightly, mouth dropping into a frown. Why does he get the sinking feeling (ha ha) that the captain isn't going to help? Maybe it's something about the way he's talking.

Weak? Luffy, that hurts. ""...Hey! You're talking to the one who took out a merman by himself! And two officer members of Baroque Works!"" C'mon, Luffy, you remember that! He tugs at the weights again to no avail, eyes widening as the water starts running. ""Oi, Luffy, this isn't funny!""

Tug. Tug. ..Hey, look, that one weight moved like... half a millimeter. ""Stop joking around and let me up! I know how bad water is for you!""




Luffy's head lifts a little, his smile having vanished in favor of a flat line.  Eyes narrowing, he leans forward over the lip of the tub, growling under his breath.

Next is the feel of a fist thrust down against Usopp's stomach, unexpected, unannounced.  ""SHUT. UP.""  His hand withdraws as he does, sitting down again at the edge of the tub, quiet for a moment.  (( I know how bad water is for you! ))

""I don't think you do, Usopp,"" he says again, calm once more, almost completely cast in shadow, but for a golden outline along his left side and a small, flickering reflection in his eyes.  The water creeps like a slow, liquid glacier, filling the bottom of the bathtub by first soaking into cloth or spilling over weights and limbs alike.  He raises his palm to rest the side of his face against it, amusement next in his voice.  ""There's nothing quite like experiencing it.""

""The point where your lungs burn for want of another breath.""

""When your head starts pounding.""  He counts these with a sort of fondness that's chilling.

""And all your thoughts come into one clear, desperate hope: That -someone- will pull you out.""

By now, the water might be making it hard to even hear him, having reached the level of Usopp's ears.



In most cases, getting slammed in the gut by one of Luffy's punches would make nearly anyone double over. Only... Usopp can't, as the weights on his hands and feet are keeping him from moving much. He does curl his head in, letting out a pained breath. ""Lu.. lu... luffy?"" What is going on around here? First Nami tries to eat a giant centipede, now Luffy's acting all... not-Luffy! If only he had his socks handy, this would all be fixed!

It's too bad, really, that the long nose doesn't help him much in breathing. But he tilts his head back anyway as he feels the water coming around his neck. ""Luffy, you made your point! Turn it off! Oi, Luffy!"" The marksman's eyes widen as he casts a panicked look upward, straining his neck as far as it can go. ""You hate it when captains do this, Luffy! Since when do you treat nakama like this!"" 

And then? Well, he can't really talk anymore, as the water has risen up over his mouth. These deep tubs may be great for keeping the bathroom dry on a ship, but they're not so great for not-drowning in, and it's only by stretching as far as he can that Usopp is able to keep breathing through his nose. 

This has to be a dream. Luffy would never do this. He would never hurt nakama like this.

What kind of brave warrior of the sea would he be if he died by drowning in a bathtub?



It's such a shame.

The only one who suspected anything, at first, the only one who suspected the truth would be the last person anyone on the Going Merry would listen to.  Their only remaining key to the truth would lie in a book Nico Robin was trying to translate.

And now, one by one, he was doing everything in his power to damage, destroy, or twist every friendship his host body had.  ""Hehehe.  Nervous?  It's -just- a little water.""  The straw-hatted sillouette lowers a hand to the tub, flicking fingers in the deepening water, sprinkling droplets at Usopp's head.  ""Completely -harmless-.  What do -you- have to be afraid of?  /You're/ not cursed by the sea at all.""

Nakama.

Since when do you treat nakama like this!

Luffy turns his head away and sits, with his back to the wall of the bathtub, listening to the sound of water and a nakama's efforts not to drown.  He's silent.  Counting seconds.  He'll wait, it seems, until he's sure Usopp will begin wondering if this is how he'll die.

And then a hand thrusts into the water, seizes him by the front of the shirt, and pulls him up to let him breathe.  ""The -ONLY- thing that keeps weaklings like you alive is the MERCY of those more powerful than you are!""



Eyes narrow. This isn't Luffy. It can't be. Luffy would never do something this mean-spirited, especially not to nakama. As the water continues to rise, Usopp inhales as much as he can through his nose and holds his breath. It's all he can do. He's no Sanji. He's not as good of a swimmer, and can't hold his breath as long. But he won't die here. He can't.

And it's only when his vision begins to get fuzzy from lack of oxygen that he feels a hand grabbing him and lifting him up. It takes a moment for his brain to register that and open his mouth to start breathing again, gasping big mouthfuls of air. When he finally thinks he can speak again, Usopp... well, he tries to lift an arm, but those weights keep his limbs dangling pretty uselessly. ""Since when do you care about power, Luffy? If all you cared about was strength, you never would have let me into your crew! I'd never have gotten the chance to live my dream! What happened to you, Luffy?""



""That's your mistake!  Ever -trusting- people, Usopp!  When you should know better of people, being a -liar- yourself!""  The hand fisted in the soaked front of Usopp's shirt shakes him once, as if he might bring the point home on strength alone.

It's almost worse, when one can't see his expression and must only -imagine- it, when so much hate and malice is uttered out the captain's own throat.  Or perhaps it's better, because to see it would be a nightmare more horrific, when it's so entirely wrong, wearing his skin and using his voice.

""/I/ never wanted you!  It was never /my/ choice, but now it /is/, and I CHOOSE to keep you because you're USEFUL, and you know this ship better than any of us.""  But of course it had been his choice.  It'd been his invitation, too.  It had been his responsibility, that decision, and yet here he is, claiming it isn't.  That he'd never wanted Usopp in his crew in the first place.

""JUST REMEMBER,"" he growls heatedly, ""You're only ALIVE as long as you keep yourself useful.  Don't FOOL yourself into thinking I give a damn about your otherwise worthless, cowardly hide!""



The shaking doesn't help things, as the force makes the weights scrape along the inside of the bathtub. Strangely enough, one of the thoughts running through Usopp's head is that he'll have to fix those so water won't leak and damage the wood of the ship...

Luffy's words bring him back to the present, though, and the marksman's eyes close briefly. ""...Luffy."" When his eyes open again, tears are streaming down Usopp's face, and it's only those cursed weights that keep him from doing... something. He doesn't know what he wants to do, but something! And Usopp knows you're never too manly to cry at the right time. ""You chose me to be your nakama because I have a dream to become a brave warrior of the sea!"" After all, how long was it before he showed himself to be a handyman around the ship? Good with a cannon? Useful for anything besides running? 

Considering what a coward he usually is, though, Usopp is strangely not making any attempts to escape, not begging for his life... Nope. Sniffing slightly, he opens his eyes and looks straight into Luffy's shadowy face. ""You're not Luffy. The Luffy I know would never call me a coward. The Luffy I know would never do this... The Luffy I know loves his nakama!""



Usopp's words fall on deaf ears, but the courage it takes to speak them, the expression of -faith- is what cuts deep.

Fingers twitch impotently, while the shadowed captain fights a battle with himself.  There is that damnable weakness.  Again, it's there every time he resolves to rid himself of these people and go his own way, it's there to stop him each and every time he entertains the thought of how easy it could be to simply wring his neck and be done with it.

Surely, these people would sooner Fade from the Dream than face the idea that their own beloved Captain had slain them.

But every single time, there's always a strange sort of paralysis that seizes his fingers; like now, he's watching himself close the tap while holding Usopp aloft, watching his hand dip into the water to pull the drain plug, as if they were moving of someone else's accord.

It's this frustration that kills any urges to feel triumph when that bothersome -shard- retreats at last, exhausted, and his limbs are his to move again.  

The water is already draining.

""You're right.  I'm not the Luffy you know.  He's dead.""



Frankly, it's a mix of anger and complete and utter fear that keeps Usopp from blinking as he continues to stare into Luffy's eyes. It's hard for him to tell which of the two emotions has more control at the moment, but Usopp angry is a rare and sometimes disturbing occurrence. He's not -always- the goofball coward... only most of the time.

It isn't until he hears the sound of the water starting to go downt he drain that the marksman's glare falters, glancing briefly down toward the tub. Did that just happen? It had to... he was still all wet. When the rubber man speaks again, Usopp lifts his gaze once more. ""Liar."" Takes one to know one! ""Luffy would never die and leave something like you in his place. Never."" I'm not afraid of dying, Luffy had once said. If you live your life as you dreamed, why should you be? But no, Luffy would never let this... -thing- into his nakama. Never.



What happens next is quick and probably painful.  But a hand still wet from the water takes hold of Usopp's face and roughly shoves his back against the wall of the bathtub to pin him there, to the rough scrape of weights along the ceramic lining the tub.  ""More than treasure can be found in 'that place',"" hisses the parasite that speaks with Luffy's voice.

""'I want to be pirate king.  I'll sail the Grand Line with my most important people, my -dearest nakama-,"" he says mockingly, ""And find the One Piece, the greatest of all treasures.""  

(( One Piece?  ...What's that got to do with being Pirate King? ))
But what about all those times...
(( What are you saying?  Don't talk like that about your dream. ))
...that Luffy didn't seem to remember the One Piece?
(( But I-- ))

""What's the point?  Dreams like that are pathetically naive.  When it comes down to it, all that matters is strength.  All that matters is having the power to make sure NO one ever takes advantage of you, no one ever WINS at your expense.""



""Mmph! Mpphfffy!"" Wham! Ow. Okay, that definitely hurt. Once his mouth is free enough, he lifts both brows. ""That place? Ruined Crescent?"" Yeah, there was that book... but somehow Usopp feels it may not be safe to ask about that right now. This gets stranger and stranger, and Usopp will probably put things together more fully once he's out of these weights and not being battered around as much. 

""Power? That's not what you care about, Luffy! That's what Kuro cared about! And Arlong! And Crocodile! And Bellamy! And Eneru! But you never cared about that!"" Bellamy... Luffy is starting to sound a lot like the hyena. But no, no goofy grin or tongue sticking out. Strike that idea. 

""You don't have to be strong if you have your nakama looking out for you and helping your dreams!""



Unsettling, isn't it?  All those people, they considered themselves great men, men to be feared.  They put all their faith in their own strength, in what they could physically crush if it wouldn't obey their orders or bend their knee to their power.  Luffy succeeded not on his own power, but because of his friends, those people who were always there for him.  And now he was sounding just like all those men he had defeated with the help of his nakama.

Ruined Crescent.  The name makes him bare his teeth in a snarl of suppressed fury, and for the second time he's stopped - somehow - from giving into the urge to crush the marksman's throat.  ""I'm NOT going back there!  EVER!""

Even the sound of the clocktower's bells make him -twitch-.  His fear of that place is overwhelming.

""Nakama, nakama, NAKAMA!  I'm TIRED of that word!  I'm sick of it!  Lose EVERYTHING, Usopp!  Lose EVERYTHING and THEN you'll see how EMPTY that word is!  The only thing you can rely on is yourself and your own power!""



That hit a nerve, did it? ""Ggggkt."" When did he say anything about going back to the Ruined Crescent? Gritting his teeth, Usopp glares at Luffy once more. ""You were never scared of anything before, Luffy."" Now he's scared of.. what? a clock? Somehow, Luffy being afraid of anything, much less a place, doesn't sit right.

""If it wasn't for nakama, I'd be dead a dozen times over by now. And so. would. you."" Yeah, let's try to poke at the guy who's got you in a stranglehold. Smart move. ""Without us, you'd still be lost somewhere in East Blue, probably stuck at the bottom of the sea."" Let's not mention where Usopp would be if Luffy and crew hadn't come to Syrup Village when they did. He knows very well he'd either be dead or living as more of a coward than ever. ""You'll never know what it's like to lose everything, Luffy, because you still have us!""



""LIAR!""  Fingers close down again, but only briefly, and this time, they're around his throat and under his jaw, not quite enough to strangle him, but it keeps him uncomfortably upright just the same.  ""LIAR.""  In the strange lamplight, his shoulders are shaking, as if he'd been the one sitting in cold water, not Usopp.  Given his tone, it is very likely rage.

""You don't know anything!""  But of course not - he's tried so hard to make sure NONE of them knew, about where he came from, what he'd seen.

""Talking to you more is a waste of breath,"" seethes the monster wearing Luffy's skin.  He's reaching behind him for a cloth that he is careful not to breathe near, soaked with a sedative that he'd arranged for this very purpose, starting to try to put this cloth over Usopp's mouth.

""Oyasumi.""  Good night.



Liar? You do realize who you're talking to, right Luffy? Of course he is! But not in this case. Nope, he's speaking the full truth. The truth hurts sometimes, ne? Usopp does his best to struggle with the weights on his arms, half-lidding his eyes. ""Are.. you.. really... sure... about... that.. Luffy?"" Another nerve struck. Perhaps when he wasn't so burdened by these weights, he'll be able to look more into this.

Not another word escapes Usopp's mouth as Luffy brings the cloth in, only a slight struggling. Then, after a breath or two, the struggling dies down, and the marksman sinks once more into unconsciousness."

It's rather typical to say 'It started on a stormy night', isn't it?  Too bad the storm's off further inland.  Out there, distant growls of primal thunder, far-off flickers of purple-white arcing amidst the dark clouds that slid across the horizon.

The port was deceptively quiet in the evening; mariners who heard the distant storm decided to pack up an hour early, rather than risk their evening getting drenched on should a stray wind blow the storm across Bluefinger Port.  The Going Merry's sails were already neatly pulled up and tied away.

Earlier that day, Luffy had been at the outskirts of town, doing what he'd said to Zoro.  It was time they made their mark.  They needed to start challenging the captains of every pirate crew until they knew not to mess with the Straw Hat Pirates.  Or Nojiko and Nami's suggested trouble with another nameless crew might come back to play round two, as a different crew harassing their nakama.  Zoro's help was needed.  He agreed.

For most of the afternoon, the captain was delivering his offer on the captain of a ship called the Vermillion Starfish when Knives had the opportunity to pass by and witness something that put the thorn of suspicion into the Plant's mind.

And it wasn't that the straw-hatted captain was enjoying a brutal beatdown far more than was characteristic of him, either.

At present, hours later, Luffy's clad in shorts and a red t-shirt, straw hat and sandals, securing the last few knots on the main sail of the Going Merry.




After the previous evening, Nami's been .. rather edgy. Not to mention feeling all sorts of discomfited. It must have been something she'd eaten. SHe hasn't been able to keep anything down since that haunch of pork earlier that afternoon. But she was still -hungry- dangit. She felt like she hadn't eaten anything all day -- and she probably hadn't. Even if Luffy hadn't been off on errands of his own, Nami would have been inclined to avoid him.
 
Right now? Right now she's tracking the storm from a distance, standing near the head of the Going Merry with an open notebook and telescope. Though she is distracted from time to time, by waves of nausea that come and go, she never lets on about it. Again distracted, this time by a small yellow canary that alights on the railing of the ship, Nami lowers her telescope to let it rest against her chest, and ..stares. 
 
 ... Bird.
 
Her tongue darts out, runs over her lips slightly, slitted eyes narrowing the tiniest bit. A shift of her stance, tensing -- and her hand snaps out. The bird lets out a startled chirp, taking to the air, only for Nami's fingers to close around it, effectively trapping the wee beastie. Her hand swipes up by her face, and .. Nami turns her attention back to her book, a few feathers drifting past the railing and into the sea. The bird is no longer seen. o/~ 
 
What? I din' do NUFFIN.




Ah, there's just never a dull moment around them. Nojiko can appreciate that though. She lived a life -full- of dull moments for many years, and without the opportunity to enjoy it in the slightest, given the tension that Arlong and his brutes created. Luffy's return had nudged Nojiko's meter back towards the 'good humor' side. But now after the conversation she and Chopper had...
 
That's not to say that she's in a /bad/ mood. Only wondering, and more than a bit worried. Of course logic and technicalities haven't sunk into her head, as filled as it was with everything else. Otherwise she'd realize that most likely, she has nothing to worry about at all. But that wouldn't be as much fun either!
 
There's the sound of a splash on the starboard side of the Going Merry, but Nojiko emerges from the water not long afterwards. Funny, she used to -love- the water. Now it's as if she can barely tolerate it. But it was still time enough to get what she wanted, and she crouches down on the dock where she is to start in on the fish that still flops even as she grips it in her mouth. The storm is met with a low warning rumble in her chest, but a little 'sushi' is apt to cancel out the agitation at that. <3




You can see a lot from up here on the main mast.  It's while Luffy is looking around to check if he missed anything (like, say, a loose wooden object that might coincidentally clock Ranma upside the head and make him think he's an 8-year old girl again or something), his hat resting behind his head on the string around his throat, when he spots the vanishing act of a bird into the navigator's mouth.  If he'd happened to look over his shoulder at Nojiko, he would've noticed something ALSO strange - the fish that is likely to be eaten -raw- (unwashed and uncut, even!  Now that's hungry!

For the moment, he's just gawking.  Did he just see that?

There are no exclamations of 'sugee!' or 'wow!' or anything like that; Luffy only swings down to the deck and makes for where Nami sits in all due haste, all but literally bowling over the navigator in her chair to grab at her head and peer closely.

That, uh, can't look good to the average passerby. <_<;;

""Spit that out!"" he says quietly to her, eyes wide.  ""That's dirty!"" 

Wow, that doesn't sound good either.  Luffy, stop talking.




Spit it out? That's her DINNER!! Nami was about to go back to charting the storm, cheeks slightly bulged with the bird in her mouth. Though with Luffy bearing down on her, Nami gets.. rather defensive, ducking her head and -GROWLING- when Luffy grab it and insists that she spit the bird out. What's dirty about it, I ask you? Abandoning her notebook, she lifts both hands to shove at Luffy's shoulders - unfortunately she can't make much more of a vocal protest than the muted angry Yowling. So Luffy's trying to peer at her face, while Nami is trying to pull free - uh.. backup! She needs backup! Hey Nojiko, help! Someone's trying to steal your sister's dinner!



Nojiko crunches on the fish, ripping shreds of flesh away from the bones...and sometimes not. She does have the advantage of removing a shard when it threatens to stab the inside of her cheek. She's not a -complete- animal! A flicker of movement to one side catches her attention though, causing her to pause and focus in on it. Another cat, lured that close by the scent of her prey. She growls in warning, causing it to retreat back a step or two. Blink. What the hell is she doing? Noji comes to her human senses then, the fish dropping from her mouth as she hastily scampers back from it. All yours, kitty! She turns to quickly board the ship, wringing water from her wet clothing and -trying- to figure out the general oddness that's surrounded the crew as of late. Oddness in the form of Luffy manhandling her sister. Her eyes narrow, and she begins stalking closer slowly as she takes a moment to just watch.




Now, anyone in their right mind, having shot more than one member of a crew, would not actually COME BACK to not make amends, but nail their beloved captain to the wall. But it's been the popular opinion of more than one person over the past decades that Knives doesn't quite play with a full deck anyway, so these kinds of phenominally stupid things are really par the course. Anyone lacking a bit of realistic view on how people interact would be aware of this.

But to make it truly Knivesish in the spectacular lack of forethought areas, he would have to come and drop in to make his accusations while as many people as possible are on board. So of course, this is exactly what he does.

Granted, he'd thought about it a lot. Sure, he still didn't understand how people are SUPPOSED to interact with eachother, but he's learning slowly. And after watching Luffy take far too much pleasure in beating to a bloody pulp someone that Knives was pretty sure didn't actually do any harm, a certain concern was set in mind. One easily investigated by those with telepathic leanings... and it was not an experience the Plant was too keen to repeat. He remembered how Luffy's mind felt when they'd fought, knew the Pirate by presence alone.

And never once had the man who would be Pirate King ever left Knives feeling revolted and filthy, as if he'd reached for a familiar book and found in its place a hole of blackened slime. It had taken a bit of work, very careful, to discern that Hoatzin was still there (a presence he /still/ shied away from with the memory of the -pain- that Bird could inflict) and so was buried under the film of oil, the sense he'd always associated with Luffy. Knives had dealt with spirits, undead and monsters long enough to recognize possession when he found it.

And sets out for the ship after coming to his decision with quick stride and murderous intent. Those on the boardwalk and docks are already familiar with Griffin Vulture's local butcher, and are quick to get out of his way.




The little reindeer doctor makes his way to the deck, holding a book to his chest. Ahh, finally! Just the thing he was looking for! He had to show his nurse! Having already checked the girls' rooms, he figured that Nojiko in her condition might be exhibiting signs of nesting, just like the book said! So where would he be likely to find her? Probably up in the crow's nest, preparing to feather her nest or something. How shocked he'd be to see Nami had already caught the feathers already for her sister, such a nice sister too! 

 The young reindeer doctor finds the sisters and his captain on the deck, greeting them happily. ""Hiiiiiiiiii!"" he exclaims. ""How's everyone?"" he burbles as he trots up with the book held against his chest.




""I said--""  Augh!  Stop being so stubborn!  Just spit out the damn bird!  It's dirty! >_<;  Those things don't even take baths around here!  Maybe!  Okay, so maybe they do, but not with soap!  GET IT OUT OF YOUR MOUTH!  Not so much manhandling her as trying to coax her to spit out the thing, at least until her resistance proves he ain't getting anywhere soon unless he tries -something- more effective.

It is, funny enough, a childhood memory that gives him this idea, of what would happen whenever -he- put something in his mouth he shouldn't.  And it's not grabbing her by the ankles and shaking it out.  He hooks an arm under her waist and gently knocks her over forward, catches her in the other arm.

He's just put Nami over a knee.  Fanboys everywhere rejoice. 9_9;  Or plot Luffy's premature death.  He raises a hand in the air.  ""Spit it out!""

Yeah.  Did we mention everything's just wrong lately?  Luffy looks up, one hand poised in the air, Nami tipped forward over a knee, and blinks at Chopper.  ""Just fine.  Gimme a minute--""  Oh gods!  Is he really going to go through with it?!  It seems he would, except he looks again up, this time past Chopper, squinting at the approaching figure he can't quite place yet.  Someone's headed this way?



He. Did NOT! Nami's warning growl rises in pitch - MY bird. Get your own! And when she's abruptly tipped over his knee? Her eyes wide and she pinwheels for balance for a second. If she had ears, they'd be pinned back right now, her tail lashing in impotent fury. The hand raised, threat clear. Spit it out, or she'll get smacked. Nojiko! Do you see this!? ;.; He's gonna hit your little sister! But the threat seems to be successful - with an expression of EXTREME annoyance, she opens her mouth, and the little bird makes a mad dash for freedom. 
 
Nami glances after it longingly, and then snaps her gaze back towards Luffy with an audible snarl. LOOK what you did! You made me lose my lunch! But before she can bite him for it, she hears other voices, senses the presence of another, and glances back. Blink. Wait. Wait. Hold the freaking phone. 
 
WHY IS SHE OVER LUFFY'S KNEE, and WHY does she have the taste of bird feathers in her mouth? She spits once, a feather left behind by the bird. Bewildered first - MORTIFIED second. NOJIKO. HELP ;.;! ""The hell do you think you're /DOING/?"" What did /he/ think he was doing - what'd /she/ think she was doing, stuffing a dirty bird in her mouth like that?



""Luffy."" Nojiko's voice rings out softly but evenly, a brief pause given before she continues. ""/What/ do you think you're doing to my sister?"" She practically echoes her Nami's question. Normally it probably wouldn't bother her as much, she might even think it's funny! (If it were someone else anyway. c.c) But right now...if she had a tail it would be lashing while the rest of her pretends to be nonchalant. Yes, she heard that warning growl from Nami too, and probably understood as much from it as from actual words right about now. Sometimes toms really press their luck with females. That's what it's starting to look like to her right about now. Nojiko crouches down, placing her palms against the deck as she just waits for some sort of explanation. She'll give him that much, but her muscles are already tensing for the pounce if he doesn't let go of her. Even a myriad of scents on the breeze can't distract her right now.



Knives isn't much given to wearing gray, but the red coat he'd 'borrowed' from his brother was currently draped over a giant watermelon stuck in a small gulley a good ten miles away, leaving him with somber colors and a rather unpleasant job to do. He'd have rather the jacket. Sea breezes were cold. Whether or not he's noticed, whether or not there are other people than his target on deck, the Plant has absolutely no problems with turning onto the dock that moors the Going Merry and ascend its ramp.

They now have something more to worry about than whether or not Nami's going to get a spanking. Gunwielding madmen are not safe things.



 The little reindeer blinks slowly, his head tilted akimbo as he observes this most interesting situation. He'd read a bit about this... but this usually was reserved for disciplining children. Was Luffy getting in some early practice for the baby on the way? Wow, he didn't even realize Luffy's affection for nakama would extend even that far to Nojiko's future children! Wasn't that nice? The reindeer beams. ""Don't mind me, go ahead, I just wanted to show Nojiko this book!"" he exclaims, stepping backwards and allowing Nojiko to question... wait. What was she doing like that? ""Nojiko? Are you all right?"" he asks, a split second before his ears quirk, turning towards the ramp where footsteps were coming. ""Hello?"" he greets the newcomer.



What a sight they must make.  Luffy with his hat off and resting between his shoulderblades, one hand in the air as a silent threat of what would happen if Nami didn't spit out the poor bird - which is, by now, flying away to freedom much to Nami's distress - and tearing his gaze away from trying to figure out who it is approaching the ship where it's docked at Bluefinger Port to look at Nojiko.  Who is currently crouched in a rather feline fashion.  So, both tangerine sisters haven't escaped the strange feline curse from Ruined Crescent, huh?  They're BOTH gradually taking on more and more cat-like traits, and their Captain's been Darkened (though no one really knows it, yet).

Oh, and did we mention Nami was currently over one of his knees?  Yeah, this probably doesn't look good in the least.  He points at Nami, giving Nojiko a blank stare.  ""She had a bird in her mouth.  Gone now, though, see?""  Luffy exclaims, turning Nami's face towards Nojiko with a grimace.  Or maybe that was a grin.  Ahem.  Nami is straightened and nudged away with a delicacy of someone carefully putting back a vase they got caught stealing.  Ahehehe.  What navigator?  He pulls his hat on, adjusting it with a chuckle.

""Thanks, Chopper,"" he adds, with no small amount of amusement, albeit of a darker variety.  ""I--""  Luffy's smile vanishes when he looks again over towards the ramp.

His head bows a little, eyes narrowing in the shade of his straw hat.  The next word is uttered low.  ""...Arlen.""



When her head is turned towards Nojiko, Nami can't help but -snap- at Luffy's hands. >.< RAR! No touchie! Though when she's nudged away, Nami quickly skitters away from Luffy to move to her sister's side, bumping shoulders with the girl. Saved! But she lost her lunch. ;.; She lifts a hand to her mouth -- stops short, eyeing the book in Chopper's hand, ""Ne, what is that-"" Oh .. oh a foul stench she had hoped never to catch wind of. Arlen's presence brings yet another /HISS/ from Nami, who shifts her stance a little in clear, 'Go away!' gesture. ... though she grabs for Nojiko's arm when she realizes she's hissing, and shakes her head a bit. Er. Yeah. That wasn't me. That was .. uh.. to coin a phrase from Usopp, 'Oh Look! An Obvious Distraction!' (RUN)



Conis steps into the room cheerfully, mostly oblivious to the goings on aboard the ship. She had just been exploring mostly, since this was to be her new home. Upon spying Luffy, she beams and calls out, ""Oh! Luffy-san! I was just looking around, I hope I'm not intru~~"" she stops mid-word to fully take in the situation. After a moment, the angel-girl tentatively asks, ""Am I.. interrupting..."" her mind wanders a moment, hunting for an appropriate word, but can only come up with, ""... something?"" Because, most assuredly, SOMETHING was going on...



""Hmm."" Nojiko isn't sure if she doesn't understand Luffy's reasons, or simply doesn't like them. She had a bird in her mouth? So what? Isn't chicken a bird too, and Luffy they eat that all the time! Err...yeah. Her eyes remain narrowed as Nami makes it to her side, her gaze averting just long enough to sniff at her sister. No injuries, right? He didn't hurt you, did he? And then it's back on the captain. But not for long.
 
Arlen? Nojiko's eyes wide as she stands upright again, spinning around to see if the footsteps she heard truly belonged to him. The first time they really met was aboard the Going Merry. She'd tried to attack him then too. A cat's heart beats twice as fast as a human's. And Noji can feel her speeding up. She just has to figure out why.



""Technically, you're out of my jurisdiction, but I'll make an exception for you. I don't know who you are or what you want but I don't really care either. Leave, or be removed."" Knives responds to that low word promptly, disliking the sound of it when spoken by a mind he did /not/ know. Technically whatever was inhabiting Luffy was alive and therefore out of the reach of Griffin Vulture's; possessions were someone else's problem to deal with. Did the darkened captain know why he was here? Surely it's not to apologize, not with a 'greeting' like that. Nami's hissing draws a brief glance, and Knives actually -realizes- she's there, as well as Nojiko, but he only winces slightly and tries to put them out of his mind. He didn't know the small deer (who was most definitely NOT human, and therefore not automatically disliked by the lanky alien), and so disregarded the hello past a quick, acknowledging nod. Hi.

This was not the way he'd intended to speak to Nojiko again. Anything but. In fact, he'd hoped to avoid her entirely, since that was the decision he'd already come to and worked out and explained and reasoned out time after time to himself. Feelings were irrelevant, he had a job to do. Why couldn't she have been out shopping right now? Why did any of them have to be here? They'll try to interfere, unaware of the viper hiding behind their captain's eyes. Conis is as recognized as Chopper (that is, not at all), but is responded to at least. ""Yes."" She's inturrupting. ""I suggest you go below decks. This won't take long.""




Woah!  Watch those fingers!  Luffy's sure Nami doesn't have a strong enough jaw to do his fingers any real damage, but being bitten isn't fun (someti--*BRICKED*), so he's giving his fingers a cautious shake when Nami rejoins Nojiko.  Whew.  All five there?  Good. <3

But that was then.  And this is the captain now, staring across at the Plant on his ship with eyes narrowed, arms crossing, chin lowered with his mouth a flat line of displeasure.  ""Who the hell do you think you are?"" he says, after a silence.  ""-You- can't tell -me- to leave.""

For a moment, the captain says nothing, and stares.  Then, he quirks up the corner of his mouth in a soft, breathed, scoffing laugh.  ""Ohhhhh.  /I/ get it now.""

He takes a step forward, uncrossing his arms, shaking his head with his eyes hidden under his hat.  ""You -really- don't know when to quit.  Are you so determined to have her that you'll stoop to trying to kick her own nakama out of her life?""

""Don't make me laugh."" A quick glance is sent to his nakama; were they buying this? How much did Knives -know-? Damnable gods! Meddling again?! And STOP THAT INCESSANT CHATTERING, Hoatzin! Your Priest isn't HOME. ""Try the Ruined Crescent,"" he mutters.




""No."" Nami counters, shaking her head at Conis and Chopper. They don't have to go down below deck - Knives had no authority here; and though she answersh er two friends, she doesn't once take her eyes off of /him/, lips curling back into a snarl, her entire body tensed. Go on, give her a reason to pounce and shred you to pieces! Or at least attempt it. ""He's leaving."" The 'he' of course, is in regards to Arlen, as Nami bristles further - bur instead of reaching for a /weapon/, she half crouches, the warning grown rising in pitch. 
 
Wait.
 
WHAT In the name of the Twelve Unholy Terrors did Luffy just /say/?
 
Nami shoots the Captain a wide eyed glance. He CAN'T be serious. Knives couldn't be /THAT/ stupid could he? TO come onto the ship and try and steal her sister away? Nami snarls, meaning to pull Nojiko back with her, ""Get Lost - you don't belong here."" She hisses to Arlen. GRR. GRR! My sister! MINE!



Conis looks around a little nervously, the tension in the room causing her mild discomfort, even with her lack of involvement. Something unusual was going on... both Nami and Luffy were behaving oddly, and an unfamilliar man had just told her to leave. She asks cautiously, so she would at least have something to go on, ""What's wrong? Who are you, and what is it you intend to do that requires me to leave? I mean no offense, sir... I'm just trying to understand. You don't seem to be among Luffy-san's nakama, everyone's behaving so angrily. Is something amiss? Can it be worked out peacefully?"" She watched Knives hopefully, looking for something about him that didn't make the hairs on the back of her neck stand.



Nojiko 's lips finally part, curling delicately away from her teeth as an unearthly yowl escapes her. The cat still snacking on the fish down on the dock below scampers off without finishing his meal. He knows that sound...that's the sound of a cat in distress. Albedo, Zoro, Luffy, Nami...everyone else's words mingled together in her head. Why the hell couldn't he say something?
 
Anything.
 
Hoped to avoid her entirely? Let Nojiko help. Her body coils, propelling her forward to leap onto the railing of the ship where she perches for a long moment.
 
'Just so you know...I'm never running from you again.'
 
So she lied. He abandoned her. Now they're even.
 
Nojiko leaps down onto the dock, though it seems a ridiculous thing for her to do. And yet she manages it easily, almost gracefully, crouching on all fours where she lands before racing off into the darkness.




""Shut your filthy mouth, parasite."" He's not here to try to steal Nojiko away. Even if the idea appealed quite suddenly. Take the girl, get the hell out of Dodge. But whether or not he'd burned his bridges here, it was their fault he had the shred of decency required to be willing to try to shake this Darkened creature from the captain the Straw Hats knew and loved. ""I -can- tell you to leave, and I will. Or I'll kill you, and let Hoatzin and Griffin Vulture deal with you. I'm /sure/ they'd love to speak to you in person, don't you think?"" He is very, deadly serious about this. The antics from earlier are a memory now only.

Nami's growl isn't entirely ignored either, though Knives does not take his eyes off the danger he knew of: Luffy. ""You can shut up too,"" he snaps. ""You lost your right to tell me I can't do my job when you were too goddamn stupid to realize you have bigger problems than *me* /right in front of you/. You of ALL people should have noticed something was wrong!"" If the tension was bad before, it gets worse when the Plant's mental shields begin to crack. Anger should not be a -tangible- thing, but somehow it is. Watch how fast that anger turns to something very different when Nojiko flees - bad enough he didn't understand why she was making *cat* noises, worse that she was running. Again. Somehow telling himself it didn't matter didn't help. ""...Who I am isn't important. I have no nakama. This can't be worked out peacefully. I suggest you find somewhere else to be for a while, things are going to get very messy."" Poor Conis. Diplomacy doesn't ... always work, does it?



Well, poor Knives! If he wasn't going to go after Nojiko, then Chopper would! With a quick glance towards Nami, the little reindeer quips, ""I'll go after her!"" even as he tugs at Conis' hand. Both Nojiko and Conis weren't really combatant, and they needed the diminiutive doctor to help ensure their safety. ""You come too, Conis!"" The little reindeer hesistates, glances up at Nami and his captain, and decides they can handle things just fine- Zoro was bound to come along soon, if he'd ever wake up! He lifts the book he's carrying up to Nami to take, letting her take possession of it. ""Can you hold this till I get back with Nojiko?"" he asks, eyeing Knives warily, before he bounds off past the Plant, hopefully with Conis in tow.



Conis semi paralysed with dazed confusion, she allows herself to be dragged off by Chopper. It was clear she probably couldn't do much here, at least she could try to help in other ways. The girl who'd run off is somehow important, judging by what little she'd witnessed, maybe that would be a more appropriate battle for her to wage. Conis nodded to Chopper, ""Nn, I'll help..."" she flashed a confused glare to Knives... if he truly intended to cause trouble here, Luffy would most definately take care of him. She understood that much better than most could.



Parasite?!  ...Well.  That's one way to put it.  No, the darker soul that hitchhiked along in Luffy's body when he was carried out of the Ruined Crescent knows full well how appropriate the epithet is, which might be way his brows arch in surprise, and then he has to bring a hand to his mouth to hide a brief, twitched smirk.  Instead, he manages to carry it off like a gesture of shock.  So.  The Plant knows.

""Kill me?""  Death threats, now?  It's all the captain can do not to throw back his head and laugh right here, right now, and perhaps the distraction in Nojiko, Chopper and Conis' rapid departure was what gave him that extra help in keeping his composure, but he crosses his arms, intent on responding not at all to Knives' threats.  The gods, indeed.  Hah!  What a jok--

An anger he didn't quite understand sparks up like a hot brand struck by a hammer.   Truth be told, it's that last remnant of a Luffy who was protective and affectionate for his nakama, and an instinctual rage, naturally, gets twisted and warped on its way to getting translated through the rest of the Darkened soul inhabiting his body.  He almost snarls soundlessly.

""FUCK YOU!  Don't you talk like that!  I'll kill you!  Get the hell off my ship!""

Like we said.  Twisted in translation.  And he's walking, striding determinedly, towards the Plant.  What can he do?  Shoot him?  Bullets won't hurt him.  ""Come off it!  I knew all about it!  What were you going to do after you had her, /Knives/?  Can't you see she doesn't want anything to do with you?  LEAVE!""




Bigger problem than /him/? That's a laughable idea. As far as Nami's concerned, Knives /was/ the biggest problem she knew of. Granted Luffy had been a little.. odd the other day, but trauma does that to a person. ANd he seemed to be acting normally today, so .. no, Knives was probably just spreading more lies. Nojiko's distressed yowl gets Nami to flinch slightly, but her feet seem rooted to the spot when her sister makes to escape. Go after her, or stay and defend the ship. Luffy can more than handle himself but.. Oh good! Chopper and Conis will follow. Nami relaxes, only slightly as she turns to look back at Knives. Though Nami has no fur, her hair certainly seems to make up for it, fluffing a little at the ends. Her fingers flex open and closed, pupils rounding out in mild distress until there's a rim of pink showing. She practically spits at the ground, glancing at Chopper only for a second, before she nods, distractedly taking the book. She'll look at it later to see what it is. Luffy's retaliation is surprising enough that Nami actually starts, looking over her shoulder to -stare- at Luffy as he advances. Cuz. LikeWOAman. o.o That's the second time she's heard him swear like -THAT-, and .. it's still a shock. ""...."" Wait. After he had her? Nami glances down at the book in her hand. o O ( Preparing a Healthy body for a Healthy Baby? )
 
... She glances at Luffy. Over her shoulder to where Nojiko had fled. 
 
And sssssssslooooowly.. looks towards Knives. And she is just. FAR. Too. QUiet. For comfort. Death. DEATH.
 
DeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeath!
 
Nami grits her teeth slowly, her nails starting to dig into the cover and spine of the book in her hand. Must. Not. TEAR. IT. TO. SHREDS. o O ( I.. WILL...NOT...Jump to Conclusions. Nojiko wouldn't.. COULDN'T... .. .. if That BASTARD has touched my sister I'll RIP HIM TO PIECES, BIT BY BIT, BY HAND. ) 
 
Because SURELY Nojiko didn't run off like that because Knives got her with child and refuses to own up to what he'd done. Nojiko wouldn't DO something like that.
 
Would she..?
 
""I. THINK. You should LEAVE."" Nami grits out in a low hiss, all but shaking with quiet fury. MUST. Not. Rip. Intruder limb from limb. That would leave a mess.




Bullets will work just fine when they're hollowpoint, and he doesn't /need/ guns to tear someone to ribbons. ""You think you can?"" Luffy tried killing him before. It didn't work. ""Come on, then. You don't have the strength /he/ does, and you -never- will."" Chopper is right to be wary, and the exit of the reindeer and Conis is tracked only perepherally. One by one, Luffy's potential defenders are leaving, which means less people he's going to have to get through in order to kill this thing. And less people to get away from once he's gotten rid of it. ""It's not your ship, sorry. It's theirs."" The gun he pulls isn't the black Machin Shin, it's silver, but otherwise identical. ""You don't even act right. I don't know how you're pulling this off. Last chance.""

Luffy would have long ago simply -attacked-, forget about talking and yelling. The Luffy Knives knew would have already tried to knock his teeth out at the very least instead of swearing and making insinuations he didn't want to think about right now. 'Had' her? The worst he'd ever done was give her a hug, and he doubted that's what the parasite was suggesting. ""I'll be leaving soon enough, pussy cat. First I have to deal with this thing, since none of you seem to be able to notice the snake you're clutching to your breast. Go find your sister, she didn't sound too happy."" If he werent' already used to deathglares from Nami, he'd wonder what he'd done this time! o_o



It didn't work, but THAT Luffy was weak enough to think maybe he couldn't get through to Knives, because HE thought he could somehow fix whatever was broken in the Plant with the help of a foolish small god too ugly for Golden Hall and too strange for Winterheart.  This one doesn't have a problem with making someone hurt for the enjoyment of their screams.

The captain's still advancing, but passing by Nami earns her hissing a low, amused growl in the pirate's own throat in response, the hint of a smile.  My my, so -angry-, Nami.  It suits you so -well-, navigator.

He's sobered by the time he's approached Knives, and to him he speaks with lowered voice.  ""Even if you kill me, you can't make me leave this body.  I'll come back, and keep coming back.  You can't beat me, you can't get to me where I am, Knives.  Too bad for you, but you're too late.  This is all mine, now.""



The slightest frown crosses Nami's face at Knives words. It's almost as if he knew something she didn't (Dur, he did!). And to be honest, if she had trusted him even the slightest bit, she might take his words as truth. But since she neither liked nor trusted him, why would she pay his words any mind? ... nevermind the brief, passing moments that Nami's instincts kept screaming that something was WRONG WRONG WRONG about Luffy. She'd normally pay /that/ more mind than anything else, but.. well, this was /Luffy/. Nami casts a brief, unsure glance at the back of Luffy's head - shakes her head quickly. No, don't start doubting now. The others didn't seem to think anything was wrong, so maybe Nami was imagining things. She's been feelingrather.. off anyway lately. Letting out a huff, Nami snorts at Knives, ""No thanks to a wretch like /you/."" Hmph. Turning, she starts to wander back to her chair, ""Luffy, don't fight on the ship ne?"" If he wanted to make Knives a grey smear on the docks, or drown him or put him through a WORLD of hurt, she was all for it. Nami glances at the book again. If it was up to her, Nami wouldn't just stop at a Nutcracker Tempo. She'd castrate him.



Nami might be too far away to hear what Luffy says past a vague murmur, but whatever is said is enough to stop the Plant dead, uncertainty betrayed so very obviously. What that thing said rang True, and he didn't like it at all. The gun doesn't waver, and as Luffy gets close enough, he might find that cold muzzle pressed ever so slightly against the hollow of his throat. He notices, peripherally, that Nami has walked away, and was suggesting this was -his- fault. It wasn't, he had nothing to do with possessions.

Don't fight on the ship. Why? Don't want blood on the precious wood? ""There's no such thing as too late,"" comes the angry growl in reply. Fear can so easily switch to anger and back, can't it? ""Maybe I should kill you anyway before you can hurt any of these people far worse than /I/ ever have. Even Luffy wouldn't begrudge that, would he?"" He pushes lightly, with the gun, blue eyes cold. ""His nakama come first. Threats to it are removed. You're a threat to it. I can do him one last favor, and I know how to kill in ways there's /no/ returning from.""



Nami's instincts are probably better than she realizes.  There IS something very wrong with Luffy, in the way that a funhouse mirror's reflection is more than a little warped.  But the fortunate thing in this situation is everyone hates Knives more than they can be suspicious of Luffy, and here's where the captain abuses the bond of 'nakama' no matter how it might wound them and the true owner of the body the Darkened captain possesses.

""Don't worry about the ship,"" replies Luffy to the departing Nami, locking gazes with Knives until she's already left.

He doesn't so much as flinch, even when cold metal (it's not a chain it's not seastone) settles on the hollow of his throat.  The one in the straw hat smiles coolly, lifting his hands.  ""There.  No one to interrupt us.""  Listen to all that silence.  Just the distant rumble of the storm, the groan of wood planks to the roll of the port's gentle waves.

His hand lifts, and drops onto the gun.  ""You don't want to risk that.  Because if you fuck with me again, if you interfere, your precious girl will suffer for your stupidity.""  His smile widens to a grin.  ""I spent a long time there, you know?  I learned a lot of tricks.  She'll languish for days before she dies, cursing your name and memory for every minute of it!""

""Knowing this, you won't interfere, will you?""  He shoves the gun aside, gripping it, leaning forward to hiss between his gritted teeth, ""What I want to know is why you fucked everything up before you left.""  Even Luffy's not sure why it matters, but he has a burning desire to know why.  




If what he'd told them was true, if he really was simply sick of being around humans and wanted to end things for good, it wouldn't explain the nauseating combination of rage and terror that boils up at Luffy's words when the faux pirate threatens Nojiko. It's a very effective threat indeed, by the way the Plant pales beneath tanned skin. It would be impossible to watch out for her constantly, especially given how things stand now. As Luffy sets one hand on the gun, Knives lashes out with his free hand, snarling fingers in the pirate's shirt and jerking him right off the ground by it, until they're eye to eye. Eyes gone solidly, luminant blue, at that, features twisted into a hateful teeth-baring silent snarl, radiating the sort of inhuman malice that could be -felt- like a physical thing even at a distance, the terrible killing rage that had left millions dead in his wake.

This Darkened Luffy was a predator, but how will he handle coming nose to nose with a monster who may very well be stronger and possibly much more dangerous? ""If you ever,"" comes the low, rasping snarl ground out with effort, ""/ever/ lay so much as a -touch- on her..."" The threat is not finished out. It didn't need to be. He didn't have to be Darkened to be creative with how -he- killed people. The half-question, half-demand eases some of the blind, almost unthinking anger and fear to ease, enough where he can formulate a reply ... that probably wouldn't matter to either Luffy or his Darkened self. ""A long time ago, someone came between me and my sibling, parasite, and tore our relationship apart with fair words of love and trust. I won't repeat past mistakes. If the break wasn't painful, they'd still /like/ me."" The rift never healed between those twins. And he'll be damned if he'll subject Nojiko to being forced to choose between two different forms of love. This way she won't have to.

As abrubtly as he'd reached out, the Plant lets go. ""You have balls. I like that. But if you push, I'll push back, and you won't like what happens when I do."" It's mostly bravado, but a good bluff works wonders in the natural world. He knows he can't protect Nojiko, and knows damn well he'll let things be until he finds a way to permanently fix the situation. Maybe the bluff will keep Luffy from actually hurting her for a while. Maybe it'll be enough to give this wretched little crew enough time to save themselves.

For now, until he finds a way to shake off that possession, it'll have to do. Using surly anger to mask that uncertainty and fear, Knives simply turns away to leave. Luffy may have won, and Knives' lack of attacking proved that well enough.




Hauling Luffy off his feet only makes him jerk his head back with the force of it, but as he straightens his head he's wearing a nigh deranged grin, amused in what could only be an unholy sense of glee at Knives' discomfort.  ""Haha.  Hit a chord?  You really should know better.  Getting attached makes you weak.""  Playfully extending a hand to poke at the center of the Plant's forehead, he grins wider, eyes narrowing.  ""Come on, a red button like that?  I can't -resist- poking it.""  Don't be fooled, telepath.  The hate, the malice, it hits like a ton of bricks.  But he'll feed on that and be made giddy in something he can't admit is something dangerously close to fear.

""Don't give me a reason to hurt her,"" he chides, mischievous.

Perhaps it's to Knives' satisfaction that his next wipes the smile off his face, stirring something that doesn't quite belong under all that oil-thick and vile-black ichor that acts as his soul.  Luffy glares, dropping his hand as he's let go of, dropping to the floor.  This time, it's his turn.  His fingers twitch at his sides, ""I see.  You're a monster like me.  You didn't want anyone to see it any other way, so you broke things off quickly.  In the worst possible way.""

Again, he twitches.  The pirate seems at conflict with what he thinks he should be congratulating.  One side loses the argument, and that's not revealed just who the victor is until he's lashing both hands out to grab Knives by the front.  ""That's not good enough!"" he adds abruptly, hotly.

""YOU!  You ruined everything!  You could've had something and you threw it away!""  And even Luffy doesn't seem sure he understands what he's saying, as if it came from someone else.  It's almost true.  This is again the Luffy HE knew, though it's all coming out translated via the Darkened one's vocabulary.  ""WHY?!  WHY DID YOU DO IT?!  I /BELIEVED/ IN YOU!  WHY DID YOU DO IT!!  IDIOT!  IDIOT!  IDIOT!  IDIOT!  /IDIOT/!!""




""I never claimed to be anything but a monster."" The veritable Beast, killing children and destroying villages. Knives reholsters the silver gun quietly, flicking on the safety - and is quite startled when he's siezed in return, the words spoken ringing entirely different than the poisonous promises and insinuations of before. And it hurts to be reminded of exactly what he'd lost, cuts like the tool he'd been named after and drags rage down into misery once more. ""I never said you'd like my answers."" There was nothing quite like knowingly, deliberately stabbing your first friend -ever- in the back to deliberately drive them away and make them hate you. ""I can't live your way. I'll explain why when you're you again.""

Because they wanted him to be other than he was, because he couldn't change, didn't understand how to act, was tired of being teased and taunted and harassed knowing his hands were tied so he couldn't retaliate. Because in the end he didn't deserve that kind of faith and friendship, nevermind love. How could he, after seeing how this crew really worked, ever knowingly break that up? He'd always have been an unwanted rift, even just as friends with two of the crewmembers. And he couldn't explain himself knowing that -thing- is right there, watching. ""And if you never are, be satisfied with that."" He jerks away from the pirate, with every intention of escaping that grip and simply leaving. He didn't like thinking like that. Didn't like his decisions and the feelings that caused them. He was a superior being, /above/ all of this. Above growing fond of short lived spiders.




""........""

It's amazing how fast someone's increasingly unintelligible shouts can be cut off short into a stretch of stunned silence.  Maybe whatever sliver left of Luffy inside all that alien presence within his body had expended itself on this moment and needed to rest, having said his piece.  Knives shakes his fingers loose, and they hang there empty in the air for a longer moment still, while he starts to leave.

Luffy makes no sound, no move to stop him from going.  He only stares, lowers his hands, stops, focuses on his hands.  He glances to the side, palms the side of his head and starts to laugh.  Very quietly.  Uneasy.  He has no idea what he's been doing, except yelling something, and it makes him nervous.  But it's passed, and Knives is leaving.

He pursues him to the ramp, only he leans over the railing and shouts after him an admittedly childish taunt.  ""RUN!  HAHAHA!  Run, /Knives/!  And don't interfere!  Remember what I said!  You can't watch her all the time, Knives!""

The Darkened captain leans over the rail, grinning fierce enough to be a grimace, shoulders shaking with suppressed laughter.  A shaky glance aside again, and he turns his back to the rail, sliding to sit down, his remaining laugh but a breath above a whisper.  Relief, this time.  He's not going to Ruined Crescent.  He's never going back.  This - all of it - it's his.  Not even Griffin Vulture's chosen can stop him now."

(Sceneset pose missing from log. ;o;)

When looking for a good place to nap during the afternoon, right after lunch, what better place than a garden? A large tree is his shade as he lies in the grass on his back with his arms behind his head. He has his eyes closed and appears quite peaceful, but at least he hears the sound of Luffy's voice when he's calling out to him. ""Ah?"" Zoro opens one eye and then the other when he lifts his head to look about. ""Luffy, over here!"" He sits up, setting his hands on his legs when they're folded together. Hm, wonder what that Captain of his is up to today.


Luffy's search took longer than he expected, and after he'd checked the whole ship for Zoro, decided to take his search into town.  Searching the town takes much longer than looking around on one's own ship and checking all of Zoro's most common napping spots, so it is, indeed, after lunch by the time the captain comes upon the swordsman, brushing crumbs off his fingers from a sandwich he'd consumed on his way through the garden.

He's completely neglected a crumb still clinging to the side of his mouth, but that's kind of normal for him.  Zoro's call is what keeps him from distracting himself from his search mission, and the straw-hatted pirate sprints the rest of the way over.  ""Zoro!  Quick!  I have a question!"" exclaims Luffy, wide-eyed.

""What's PDA?""  ...why the hell would he want to know what the acronym for 'Public Displays of Affection' means is anyone's guess, but he's intensely curious.



Zoro stretches his arms out over his head and opens his mouth wide in a yawn by the time Luffy comes over to see him. He wonders what Luffy is so frantic about this early, especially on such a peaceful looking day. Zoro leans back against the tree trunk behind him, folding his arms behind his head again and looking perfectly relaxed despite Luffy's aggiatation. PDA? Zoro blinks a few times at Luffy and tilts his head to the side. PDA.. PDA... What's PDA... Damnit, acronyms are sooo hard. Zoro tries to think back, sure that he's heard it before.

That's it! ""I remember a guy saying that one time in a town I was in."" Zoro flashbacks to the moment. There he was standing in the street of the town with another man with a large pink mohawk pointing a sword at hime. 'Beware my ultimate technique, Roronoa Zoro! My PDA... the Painful Death Attack! Wah-TAH!' Zoro nods a few times. ""The Painful Death Attack didn't work very well though.. I cut off his mohawk."" If Zoro remember correctly. ""Why do you wanna know about that?"" o.o



He's been looking for you for hours, Zoro!  He's had questions burning in his brain for that long!  If he's frantic on such a peaceful day, it's because he wants answers hours ago, and they're long overdue!  So he sits down abruptly, Indian-style, elbows on his knees and hands cradling his head, attentive.  Well, kind of.  His attention does stray momentarily to watch a small, white-yellow butterfly flutter past.  

""Painful Death Attack?""  Luffy blinks, surprised.  It seems he'd been expecting an answer that had little to do with violence, and he nods, blankly.  ""Okay.""  Eyes look upwards at the sky, thoughtfully, while he taps his chin with a finger.  ""Um, well, there were some people here yesterday...""

""I thought they were wrestling or something over there,"" Luffy points towards a stand of trees, ""But she told him 'no PDA'.  He wasn't going to /kill/ her, was he?!""  He seems profoundly disturbed.  HE ALMOST WITNESSED A MURDER OMG. o_o;



Zoro looks over to the crop of trees that are indicated. Hm, it looks like a pleasant spot. He's seen couples pause there now and again in order to admire the trees or listen to the birds. Which is why Zoro takes his nap waaay over here. ""Is that where you heard it?"" From two people standing by the trees? And they were wrestling? Zoro blinks a few times to himself, staring at the trees blankly. ""Maybe she didn't want their duel to be in public."" Yeah, public duels really suck! The first time he challenged Setsuri to a duel it was in a public square, though it was very late at night. Despite it this young punk thought he'd jump in, assuming Zoro was attacking her, and attempted to help her out. That was so annoying! No wonder that girl didn't want to duel in public. u.u;



Is that where he heard it?  Luffy bobs his head in a nod, lowering his hands to his lap while he cranes his neck to look that way again, as if to verify it to himself.  ""...Oh, RIGHT.  A duel!""  One fist falls into his open palm, indicating a proverbial light bulb went off in his brain, his expression lightening considerably.  ""Of course!""  His smile freezes, and then he looks -confused-.

""Is biting allowed in duels?""  This just gets worse and worse.



Biting? Zoro quirks an eyebrow at the mention of that. ""Any fair duelest wouldn't bite his opponent."" That's just bad form, as far as the swordsman is concerned. And anyone else who believed in fair play wouldn't do it either. ""Maybe if your opponent was fighting dirty you might be tempted to fight dirty in return."" Then maybe it's more justified, but Zoro doesn't think he'd ever bite his opponent. Isn't that kind of gross anyway? >.>; Yes, Luffy must've witnesses a very strange duel.



Luffy understands there are some things you don't do during a duel of swordsmen, like ...no interrupting on any circumstances, and biting is really out of the question, but he's used to fighting however he wants in a fist fight, but one wouldn't really call that a duel.  

Zoro's attempts to explain only seem to make the captain even more and more confused.  ""Okay...""  A long pause, and Luffy glances towards the trees again, frowning.  ""But I'm pretty sure they were biting.""  Sagenod.  ""I thought they might be kissing,"" protests the straw-hatted pirate, who waves his hands while shaking his head, apparently embarassed, ""But--""  People don't really kiss with their mouths open, do they? o_O;;

People are so confusing! T_T



Zoro is getting more confused by Luffy all the time! ""Biting isn't fair at all."" What kind of duelist would bite his opponent! Zoro still thinks that's a really dirty trick. When Luffy says he thinks the duelists might've been kissing he just blinks a few more times. Kissing? That doesn't make any sense! ""Maybe you just didn't see it well."" Because why would two people in the middle of a battle kiss each other? No, that makes no sense to him at all. ""I wouldn't worry so much about it, Luffy."" After all, whoever they are they're long gone. One of them could be dead by now so let's forget it and take another nap. z_z He stretches his arms over his head again and sighs.



Inwardly, the darker Luffy frowns.  Zoro sure isn't making this easy.  Perhaps he'll simply have to find another way to amuse himself with another person's discomfort.  If Zoro's just playing clueless, or really IS that clueless, then he's got his work cut out for him.  He'll play along, meanwhile.

Maybe he didn't see it well.  ""Probably,"" he says, shrugging.  Luffy pulls off his hat and turns it over in his hands, ""....""  -_o  Zoro, are you falling asleep again already?  Exhaling a sigh, he puts back on his hat, stands up, and lifts one sandaled foot... apparently aiming to step purposefully on Zoro's stomach.



Zoro was just getting comfortable again too when the foot comes down on his stomach. OOF! Zoro lurches up again and stares up at Luffy with an annoyed look. ""Watch it!"" Geez, that guy can be so clumsy sometimes. Then again, Luffy never does realize what he's doing half the time, or at least pretends he doesn't. Zoro can't count the number of times he's been thrown through the air with no regard for his well being. @.@; Zoro rubs at his stomach and sits up straight again, putting himself back against the tree once more. ""Oi, Luffy, are we staying in this port now?"" It seems they've made it more of a residence than Golden Hall lately. Not that Zoro minds it much. That other place is crawling with knights.



When Zoro looks up, Luffy's passing on by as if he were merely stepping on Zoro accidentally, on his way to pounce the butterfly he'd noticed earlier, but trying to snatch it in his hands seems to be unsuccessful.  It goes fluttering away again when Zoro speaks.  Luffy turns around and sits on the grass, nodding.  ""I like this place.  It's a good spot to restock.  I want to see what else is out there on that sea.""

Seems he's done a lot of thinking about it, but it's natural; a lot of his meager brainpower goes into thinking about his dream.  ""A lot of pirates come here, so maybe we'll learn more about the Pirate King.""  Someone did say he's still alive somewhere, whoever he is, if it's not Gold Roger.  ""But first, we need to make sure no other crew messes with us.""

He frowns.  ""I'm challenging each crew's captain to a duel until they all know they can't mess with the Straw Hat Pirates.  If any of them use swords, as my First Mate, I want you to fight them.  For us.""



Zoro smiles a bit at the mention of going out to sea again. It's been so long since they were out at sea. Zoro actually misses it more than he lets on. A pirate doesn't belong at port all the time. He thinks they must be getting too comfortable around here. At least hearing that puts the swordsman in a good mood. ""Great idea."" Zoro can only hope the others look forward to a sea voyage as well.

It's when Luffy worries about other crews messing with the Straw Hats that he knits his brow again. He's surprised Luffy would even worry about that kind of thing. This place is overrun with a lot of other pirates though. ""You're challenging them to duels?"" Now he really does sound surprised! That is what a pirate should do, isn't it? Zoro just isn't used to thinking of Luffy as a regular type of pirate. Then again, maybe Luffy had to get more serious about his dream at some point and take some sort of action. Zoro blinks once at the mention of his part in all of it. ""Well.. sure, Luffy."" How can he not if they're doing this for their nakama? For his Captain?



The warped soul that left the Ruined Crescent might know how small the ocean is, here, but who knows?  He's not telling.  But he does miss the sea - entirely for reasons different than the Luffy they traveled the Grand Line with.  He is consumed by an all-encompassing ambition to eventually bend all to the strength he will eventually achieve.  He won't stop at being Pirate King.  He'll consider himself content when every knee that doesn't bend before him is buried six feet underground, along with the rest of them.

Pleasant, isn't it?  It's a miracle he can smile or sleep at all, but the Darkened have a habit of being able to sleep in spite of being monsters.

""Yeah.  Well, there were some pirates bothering Nojiko and Nami before,"" A while ago, ""So this time, it's probably a good idea to stop it before it happens again.""  The captain spins his hat on a hand, lazily.  After a moment's pause, he chuckles.  ""It wasn't my idea.  But I heard that's what you're supposed to do, so if it's for my nakama,""  If it's for my -ambition-; nakama are just... replaceable tools to get him there, or so believes the Darkened one, ""I'll do it.  Simple as that.""



Zoro can't say he knows how large the sea is but at least it'll feel as if they're seeing new things again if they head out there. Zoro will look forward to it, even if it'll be a short trip. He doesn't know the reasons -this- Luffy wants to go out there, but he knows why the Luffy he knows would go out there and that's enough for him. When he looks at this Luffy there's a feeling that something is different about him, but it's still the face of the one person who got him and the crew through so much.

The mention of pirates bothering Nojiko and Nami brings a frown to the swordsman's face. He doesn't like hearing that. Stopping it before it happens again.. he nods at that. Yes, that's a good idea. Zoro doesn't like to sit idle when there's something that can be done to ensure the safety of others. If he has to take out a few pirate captains for that, well that's not such a big deal. ""Right."" Zoro looks over to Luffy and smiles a bit, the stern look in his eyes easing away in front of his friend. ""Don't worry, I'll take care of it."" Zoro won't let his friend and Captain down when he's needed.



Poor Zoro.  The first pirate he'd ever call friend, let alone 'Captain', and the sentiment is returned at only skin-deep.  Encountering a Darkened friend is probably among the worst possible horrors in the Dream, if only because they know -so- much about you, and could pass themselves off as relatively normal for months before the axe falls on everything.

Now, if only that damned, crazy bird living in his head would stop claiming prophesy every time Hoatzin said his reign in this current body wouldn't last nearly so long.

Zoro's reassurance is returned with a crooked grin beneath the brim of Luffy's straw hat, and the captain replies, ""Knew I could count on you, Zoro.""  And laughs.  ""It won't take long.  They don't seem so tough, but we were on the Grand Line.""  They've met tougher pirates.




Of course Luffy can count on him! Zoro is his first mate! There's nothing Zoro wouldn't do to help their nakama or assist in fulfilling their dreams! His own dream is important too of course, but Zoro isn't in the habit of letting one of his nakama down and he isn't about to start right now. Not with Luffy of all people. Zoro never thought he'd call a pirate friend and he really never thought he'd end up a pirate himself, but that all changed the first time he met his idiot Captain.

The mention of an easy victory brings a hearty laugh out of the swordsman, whose shoulders and chest shake with the humor he finds in it all. ""These guys? They're practically not worth fighting."" Not for the two of them at least! Zoro thinks they could take out the whole town and still be back to the Going Merry in time for dinner.



That idiot Captain has been nothing but trouble, but typically trouble that eventually worked itself out, and no matter the circumstances, no matter how dire the situation, they always left it smiling -- even if it took a few days of unconsciousness in bandages to get there.  Or... that's how it should be, except when they left the Ruined Crescent, something went a little wrong.

""I feel kinda bad,"" chuckles Luffy, rubbing a finger under the tip of his nose in an outwardly sheepish fashion, though his thoughts are his own, and quite contrary.  ""But that's the way it's supposed to be done around here, or we'll get pushed around.  If it's not a formal duel, it's illegal.  And I wanna be able to stay in this town in case there's storms and stuff.""

See?  Perfectly logical.  Not planning to use this as a base of operations at all.



Zoro smiles at Luffy sympathetically. He knows it isn't in Luffy's nature to pick fights needlessly. Not unless he were protecting his nakama or maybe even standing up for himself. It was more Zoro's nature to pick a fight though. That just comes with the territory of being a hot headed swordsman. o.o; ""It's alright, Luffy. We'll just make sure it goes smoothly."" Maybe no one will get seriously hurt either. Zoro wouldn't care one way or the other, but since Luffy feels bad he thinks he'll go easy on his opponents. For Luffy's sake. >.>



Truthfully, he's -counting- on Zoro being a hot-headed swordsman.  The more brutal the fight, the happier he'd be, but Luffy has to remind himself to hold back, or he'll give himself away too soon.  There's a certain amount of time, he's heard, back at the Ruined Crescent, that a soul can inhabit a body not entirely his until it starts to -become- his, and if he can hold out that long, then he's escaped the Ruined Crescent forever!

It's just getting it past the crew.  And getting Hoatzin to stop chattering away in his head, as that's REALLY annoying!  That wasn't there before!  ""Well, that's it.""  He starts to stand up, dusting grass off his shorts, adjusting his hat.  ""I'm gonna head back to the Going Merry.  You staying here to sleep, Number 1 Marimo?""




Zoro stretches himself out against the tree once more, finding comfort in the shade. He slumps down against it, smiling a bit to himself. Though it's a necessary thing to have to take out all those pirates, Zoro can't help but look forward to it. He hasn't had the chance to really test his sword skills out against an actual opponent in awhile. Should be interesting. When Luffy turns to look over and ask him the question the swordsman is already snoring. zoz Guess he's staying here after all. Beats going back to the ship where people have been acting weird lately!



Don't worry about getting started on those pirates, Zoro.  Luffy's already started issuing challenges to a few captains he saw in the tavern.  One of them laughed in his face, which wouldn't be the first time that's happened; Luffy hardly looks like anything more than a farm boy.

That's fine.  He knows -exactly- how to reward ignorance.

In fact, it sounds like fun.  Whistling a deceptively jaunty tune, the captain strolls away.  Let the swordsman sleep.  Maybe, by the time he figures out anything is wrong, it'll be too late."

"event","<lj-cut text=""The Pirates Explore The Ruined Crescent - Team: Nami, Nojiko, Zoro, Luffy."">

The problem, really, was that a treasure hunter in Bluefinger got a little too drunk around Nami. He started boasting about his adventures in the Ruined Crescent, and one thing led to another, and before you know it, he was telling her about how deep in the most dangerous heart of the ruins lie untold treasures for the taking.

Which is how the Straw Hat Pirates, or a sizable portion of them, at least, wind up tromping through the ruins. They've passed a few camps of treasure hunters on the way, but now they're far enough in that it's getting lonely. But that's good, right? Thing is, for the most part, the outer edges have been stripped clean of treasure, and these days it's hard to find anything new there. But inside...

Well, the further in you get, the fewer treasure hunters ever *return*. So that means there's more treasure there! Right?

Before the nakama now, the ground slopes down slightly. A crumbling clocktower tilts across their path, the hands on its face frozen in place. At its base is an arch. Through that arch can be seen a strange maze of passages, the light bouncing through them oddly. But if you look *around* the clocktower, there's nothing there but a collapsed dome. Strange, that.

But in the maze, something glitters.



A problem? No. A solution? Yes. Because Nami was the one who had been pouring him the drinks; one after the other, flattering him and teasing, coy flirting here, a compliment there. And all to get the information that she knew he had. Once he started talking about the Ruined Crescent, he had her full attention; and naturally, after he had passed out from drinking, she'd robbed him blind and darted back to the ship to tell the others what she'd found. 
 
Treasure hunting. There's little that Nami loves more, and not even the felony Sanji committed could get her in a bad mood for -that-. Danger? Pfah! Nami isn't concerned about the danger. Luffy and ZOro were with them. Walking side by side with Nojiko, Nami holds the lantern aloft on the end of her staff to light the way when it starts to get dark the further into the cavern they get. ""Maaa..~"" Nami breathes after a while, ""I knew it was old, but I didn't know it was /this/ old."" 
 
The thief comes to a stop before the clocktower, tilting her head up at it, then around. ""Hhhn."" Wait. Was that a glitter? Nami's face breaks out into a grin as she turns her attention to it. ""Ne minna~."" Look, look! Nami points ahead of her at the glittering shiney, as she starts forth - cautiously, of course.



These are ruins that would be undoubtedly -fascinating- to someone like Nico Robin, but for someone like Monkey D. Luffy, it's something even better (in his mind) than history: another adventure!  Unfortunately, he'd been more of a pain in the ass than a helping hand in getting to where they were within the Ruined Crescent, as he had a tendency to meander, lag behind, run ahead, and generally try to poke at everything.

Already he'd had two near-misses with boobytraps, set by treasure hunters hoping to remove a little of their own competition.  Fortunately, they'd only been things involving toppling walls or other bludgeoning traps, and had little, if any, effect on the rubber pirate.

It probably didn't help his nakama any, though. <_<;;

At present, he's gawking at the tilted clocktower and what lies, impossibly, through its arch, frequently stepping to the side to look past it, and then back to look through it.  ""Sugee.   SUGEE!"" +_+  Um, yes, he's sparkling at this latest adventure, need anyone ask?

""Do you see that too?"" asks Luffy eagerly, grinning at his three nakama, ""Let's hurry up and go inside!""



All that glitters isn't gold. Nojiko -tried- to remind Nami of that before they even headed for Ruined Crescent. It was meant as a metaphor more than anything...she thought the guy her sister originally got her info from was probably full of it. A drunk treasure hunter? How reliable is that source anyway. She didn't want her to get her hopes up only to be disappointed.
 
Would that kind of logic stop Nami from looking? Uhm...no. And would Nojiko stay behind while the others went to check it out? No again. But the deeper they're in, the more it seems possible that there might be something to it. A place this creepy just has to be hiding something good! Nojiko's still staring up at the clocktower when Nami points something else out and begins edging towards it. ""What is that?"" The older girl squints, trying to get a better look before following. ""Don't get separated!"" She calls back, wondering if it would be enough to keep their captain from exploring the clocktower first.



A treasure hunting adventure? Well, Zoro would guess it's better than sitting around on the deck of the ship all day, though he doesn't mind doing that either. Actually, he usually stays behind to watch over the Going Merry when everyone goes running off to explore, but this time, perhaps because of Nami's nagging, he came along. And he's not really disappointed either. This place is pretty interesting looking. Yes, Robin will have to come herself sometime and take a look at it.

For now, the first mate keeps up the rear of the group, glancing around and occasionally grabbing Luffy by the arm or the shoulder to bring him with them when he lags behind to stare at something COOL! When they come upon this strange toppled clock tower and the sparkling further inside the cavern he pauses to glance around. Hm, everything seems quiet enough.




The clocktower isn't quite toppled. It's just at a tilt, frozen permanently at a sixty-degree angle, as precarious and impossible as that might seem. It doesn't shake, shudder, or fall as the pirates approach. It just stands there. Waiting.

But then, as Luffy races through the arch--

A single toll of the bell within it shatters the silence, vibrating deeply across the broken landscape, shivering and trembling in its low tones. The hands of the clock still do not move.

Then the world around them changes as they step through. It's a maze of crumbling marble and rusted gears that look as if they should be turning but will never do so again. The last harmonics of the ringing bell remain in the air forever here, a low, unsteady thrum that could drive one mad if one stays too long.

The source of the glitter becomes clear after a moment. The only thing not rusted or tarnished here is a length of quicksilver-bright chain, vanishing around the corners of the maze, marking out a path deep into the ruined labyrinth.




You were saying something about it being Quiet Enough, Zoro? :D The single, sudden bell toll actually gets Nami to jump about three feet off the ground with a startled yelp. Her hands press against her ears as she casts a glare up at the clock tower, as if she could force the thrumming tone to stop from Sheer Fury(tm) alone. Sorry to pop your bubble Nami, but you don't control time or sound. Nojiko's warning is acknowledged with a small wave of her hand, before it goes right back over her ear, and the navigator pads towards her sister again, turning her gaze towards where she'd seen the glittering. Awww - it was only a chain? Mou. that isn't worth anything. Instead, she looks to the others. ""So, ne? Which way?"" Nami rather wishes she'd had a /map/ of the place. But since she didn't, there was no way of finding out what lay /ahead/ of them. Best option was probably to follow the chain; at least they'd be able to follow it out if nothing else.



Now he's done it.  Hey, guys?  Don't mind Luffy while he gets you all into trouble yet AGAIN by running off ahead when he should be using that rusty brain of his.  ""Na?!""  exclaims the captain as the clock begins to toll and their surroundings change.  Instead of being frightened, he is awestruck.  ""Woooow!"" *__*  This place just gets cooler and cooler!  

He wanders with fingers in his ears over to the chain.

That chain. (It reminds him of something.)  A silver chain. (Something he heard before.  About Promethea?) No, that was just about special paths to different places, back when people said the moon could be seen at night.  Luffy rubs a fingertip along the chain a moment, thoughtfully glancing towards his nakama.  

He is abruptly -all smiles- the moment Nami asks her question.  ""Why don't we follow this?""  Wow, Luffy, that was kind of... smart!  Hold the phone!  ""...I mean, with a chain this long, I bet the pendant at the end is really HUGE!""  -_-;  Or not.  He thinks it's one big necklace.  

Hopeless.  He's -already- trying to follow it.



Nojiko winces, her hands flying up to her ears to try and guard them against the loud toll. That's really annoying! And that isn't the dinner bell Luffy...don't go all Pavlovian on them! She lowers her hands in time to catch the last part of Nami's question. ""Back the way we came?"" Her suggestion which is accompanied by a soft chuckle. She knows very well they wouldn't go back so soon, even if they /could/. Just look at the roster here. All the usual suspects have gathered. There's a blink at what the captain says, and an expression of 'Did he really just say that or are my ears permanently damaged?' exchanged with her sister. ""Ne, Luffy!"" Nojiko calls out, but it's already a lost cause it seems. They'll have to follow him in order to stick together. And with Luffy in front of Zoro bringing up the rear...at least she and Nami should be relatively safer.



Zoro puts his hands over his ears at the sudden sound from the bell and winces. Geez! Who did that? That old clock couldn't still be working, could it? He lifts his eyes to the face of the clock but sees nothing is moving at all. ""Weird."" His hands are lowered once the sound fades a bit but Zoro still finds it annoying at best. He takes a few quick steps after the group and into the maze entrance, only to see that chain lying on the ground.

Nami may be disappointed but Zoro is just suspicious as usual. ""Oi.. who'd put that there? Maybe someone's exploring already."" That chain could be like a trail of breadcrumbs or something. It doesn't look as if it's been sitting here as long as everything else has. But despite it, Luffy is already running off following the chain. ""Luffy!"" Oh for cryin' out... *grumble* Zoro hunches his shoulders and follows after.



The path twists and turns, and all the while the chain continues to gleam. The neverending faint thrum of the bell remains in the background, too, wavering from pitch to pitch, shifting up and down slightly in volume, but never, ever going away.

The gears become rustier; the marble becomes dustier. Still, there are no cobwebs, no rats skittering around the corners. There's no life at all, in fact. Just the endless echo of the bell, making the air itself tremble.

They round another corner, and there seems to be an added shine around the next bend of the path. Could it be that they're almost at the end of the chain, and something brighter awaits them?



""If someone put it there, then that just means we'll have to re-acquire whatever they got."" And by 'we' she means you two beat 'em up, and Noji and she will take the loot. :D ( Why don't we follow this? ) Nami casts a surprised look at the Captain, and grins. ""Saaa, that's a good idea Luffy! I was just thinking the same thi---"" ....... Nami's smile drops slightly. ""...a ..pendant.."" ...Ahah..hahaha..haha.. she glances back at her sister, an identical expression on her face. ""...I can't believe I actually thought he had a BIT of sense in that head of his."" She mutters, grabbing hold of her sister's hand and breaking into a run after her Captain, with Zoro behind them. ""LUFFY! My compliment - give it back!"" And what's up with that bell? Why was it ringing still? Shouldn't it have stopped by now?



Luffy is such a pain in the ass, isn't he?  At least he pulls his own weight, but otherwise...damn!  He's such a troublemaking brat!  He's just following the chain studiously, though even his singleminded attitude is starting to fray in concentration.  And it's all thanks to that wavering noise that digs into the skin of his thoughts like a thorn.  It's aggravating.

Give it back?  ""Give what back?""  Luffy calls over his shoulder, his grin fading when he spies something glowing just around the next bend.  He stops to wait for the others, already practically sparkling with anticipation.  ""Na!  Minna!  Do you guys see that?  Did we find treasure?""  *_*;;

Naturally, the moment they've caught up, he'll run around that bend anyway.  My, aren't we eager?



Nojiko likes this plan of Nami's. It sounds smart. She sighs and offers her sister a weak smile. ""Hope really does spring eternal, I guess."" Because one of those days, Luffy's really gonna understand something! There might not be anyone there to see it, but anyway. She takes Nami's hand and hurries after him, a glance given back over her shoulder to the first mate. ""Zoro, this is no time to be napping!"" They're exploring here, step it up! Don't make her call you a rotten egg. Noji comes to a sudden halt when she looks forward again, her grin slowly fading as she starts looking more and more curious herself.



Zoro follows behind the group, now and then looking over his shoulder just out of habit, though he has no doubts in his ability to sense something that might be coming... you can just never tell in this world. Zoro's like a guard dog, this is what he does for his nakama. Somehow has to when they're all running around like a bunch of hyper active kids. And this is a strange place. It's like a void or something. Nothing moves or even seems alive but the crew walking through the maze. Even the sound of the bell has a dead tone when Zoro hears it. ""Found something?"" Good, just get it so they can get away from the damn ringing!



The scene that greets them in the wide courtyard beyond the next turn of the path is the most spectacular yet. For certain values of the word ""spectacular.""

The chain itself ends at a cracked and broken doll, life-sized and dressed in tattered lacy finery; it wraps around her and ends somewhere in the dusty folds of her dress. Around this centerpiece, glittering gems and bright jewelry vie for attention with swaths of strange cloth and gleaming weaponry. It's a veritable treasure trove, with more than enough loot to send Nami into fits of pure glee.

At a closer glance, though, all of the treasure seems to have been dropped by previous adventurers. Scattered about the courtyard are bleached bones, most of them forming complete skeletons--and all of them human.

The lingering echoes of the bell are louder here, and strange new harmonics have joined the mix. It's at a headache-inducing level now--the kind of headache that throbs behind one's eyes like something is tryiing to get out.

In the midst of this, it would probably be easy to ignore the shiny brass pocketwatch lying in the doll's lap. It's clearly not worth anything near as much as the treasure scattered all around, and it's not even working anymore. But...it is *very* shiny.



""Luffy! Don't you touch anything!"" God only knew what kind of traps he'd stumble on if he kept running ahead. And Nami really wasn't keen on running from boulders, thanks. ;.; She hunches her shoulders briefly, gritting her teeth as she casts another glare over her shoulder, ""Is that ringing getting on anyone else's nerves? It really shouldn't be ringing like that."" For that matter -- why did it even /start/ ringing? Was it a trap that someone triggered? Zoro, go back and break that thing so it stop's friggin' ringing! 
 
As she follows Luffy around the bend, she comes to a stop when she notices the chain, "".. what the..."" That's .. a little odd. But before she can comment on it, she spies the treasure trove. *_* CHACHING! B.B ""I'm HOME."" *_* *_* She reaches into her shirt without preamble and bounds for the treasures scattered around the doll, paying it ..surprisingly little mind. 
""o/~ Treasure, Treasure.. ~/o"" She singsongs gleefully, stuffing whatever she can find - discarding other things. It's then that she notices something -else-. A rather intriguing looking statuette of a gold cat, a gem-studded collar around its neck, standing on a pedestal with its mouth open in a yowl. ""Kirreii."" You're coming with /me/. She gets to her feet and reaches over, pulling it towards her. And that's when one of the skeletons falls, bleached white bones and cobwebs landing across her shoulders.
 
""IIIIIIEYYYYYYYYYEE!!!"" Nami hooks the statue under her arm and runs around in a circle, ""GET IT OFF, GET IT OFF! GET IT OFF!"" ;.; Nojiko, help! ;.; And while you're at it, someone go and BREAK THAT FRIGGIN CLOCK! It's giving her a headache!



Luffy is just inside around that corner, mouth agape while he takes in the view with an expression that best bespeaks of utter, dumbfounded amazement than a simple exclamation could.

He turns around to look at his nakama, grinning.  TREASURE!  They really DID find treasure!  Then, to Nami, ""Nami!  I'm going to find you something to make up for your trees!""  A wide grin, a short nod, and he turns around to hunt for the very thing.

It'd be just like Luffy to disregard true monetary value in favor of something shinier, imbued with more glam than the rest of the wealth before his eyes. After all, he's a true dreamer, though a little more childlike with wonder than the rest of his crew, with the exception being, of course, for the young Chopper.

The skeletons are given hardly a second glance.  Had Usopp been here, that may have been a different story, as not even Luffy can resist puppetting a skull at him just for his spectacular reactions.

His search would be more productive if he didn't keep feeling like he was hung over. -_-;  It's after two turns around the doll and stepping over the chain that he bends to pick up the shiny brass pocketwatch and lifts it over his head.  ""This one!"" laughs the straw hat captain triumphantly.  What was that about not touching anything?

""Hahahaha!  Nami!  It's just a skeleton, it's dead, it can't hurt you or anything.""  So silly, navigator.




As soon as she rounds the corner and gets a good look at everything, Nojiko is stopped again. The sight before her is unlike anything she's ever seen, and she can only wonder if the others are as (momentarily) speechless as Noji is. For a long moment she just stares, at first paying more attention to the actual doll than the treasure around it. Okay, that's just creepy. But ultimately her eyes do drop to the loot, and grow even wider still at the sight of human bones. She blinks, realizing for the first time then that Nami has broken free of her hand. Nami-chan, come back! She yells after her sister, unsure if she was even heard above the noise -- because that's exactly what Nojiko would call it.
 
Is she the only one here who's worried about joining the skeleton crew? Yes? Thought so. But she still glances to Zoro, about to appeal to him to be another voice of reason when Nami's startled cry alerts her. Damn skeleton! She just knows it must've been a man when it was alive too. >.< Nojiko hurries over, trying to untangle Nami from it but a little freaked out at the same time.




Zoro looks more interested now that they've come upon something worth looking at. Oooh, weapons! He wonders what condition they're in. The treasure itself is nice as well but something has to catch his attention first and it'll be any katanas. He stays in the back as he looks around, taking a few steps and stopping when his boot crushes the bones of an arm beneath his foot. He looks down at the remains of the adventurer and frowns to himself, then frowns even more and lifts a hand to his temple. How can that sound be getting louder? A bell shouldn't ring that long.

Zoro nudges the bones aside and continues walking over to where he sees some of the weaponry stashed, reaching to pull one of the katanas free from the group. Nami's screams draw his attention and he looks over, watching her run about with the dead man on her back. ""Would you quiet down!"" Like it isn't noisy enough in here already!



And then Luffy takes the pocketwatch. For a moment, the thrumming echoes of the bell stop. Everything is perfectly, utterly, terrifyingly silent.

Then the doll's shiny marble eyes fly open wide, and she jerks up to her feet, still tangled up in chains. ""My watch! You took my *watch*!"" And all around them, the bell starts ringing again--not just echoing like before, but actually *ringing*--sounding like a million different versions of it are chiming somewhere in the distance, all of them at odds with the other ones. It's a terrible, disorienting noise, and not one anyone should have to fight through.

But it looks like the Straw Hat Pirates will have to fight through it anyway. Because all of a sudden, the skeletons--even those that are half-broken--lurch to their feet. The air shimmers around them, then resolves into the ghostly forms of long-dead treasure hunters, features twisted in bitter anger. ""The watch!"" they cry hoarsely, their voices like distant echoes of the bell itself. Their bare white bones are almost hidden beneath the translucent flickering of their ghostly bodies as they pick up swords and axes and daggers and clubs from around them and stumble towards the intruders.

All around, more chains slice through the air. In particular, they block off the way back out of the labyrinth. As for the doll herself? She reaches for Luffy's throat.



Something to make up for her trees? Awww. Nami would feel a lot more appreciative if THAT FRIGGIN RINGING WOULD STOP. Clinging to her sister's shoulders and SHUDDERING, she glares over her shoulder, ""That's not the point!"" It was still touching her, that icky bleached skeleton ;.; When Nojiko helps push the skeleton off of her, Nami relaxes. Until the chiming of the bell gets WORSE - almost enough to make Nami want to drop her treasure and put her hands over her ears. 
 
Wait. Where did those other voices come from? ""Luffy! Put the watch back for god's sakes!"" Clearly the doll wanted it back - if the doll gets it back, the skeletons will stop right? She stuffs the cat statue into her treasure bag, then reaches to her hip and grabs the tacts. They can't have her treasure! >.<! ""Nojiko!"" Oh great, the chains have blocked the way to safety. So much for running away. ;.; Assembling the staff in a quick movement, she holds it defensively, standing back to back with her sister. And to think, she could be sipping a pina colada on the ship right now ;.;



The Straw Hat Captain -had- been laughing at Nojiko's efforts to remove the skeleton from Nami's person, until the sudden and total silence steals the mirth right out of his throat and he blinks at the brass pocketwatch clutched in one hand.  Metal usually warms to the touch, but...

Luffy brings both hands (with the watch clasped in one) to his ears, his confused exclamation almost entirely lost in the cacophony of ringing bells, eyes squeezed shut.  ""Nanda nanda nanda?!?""  The HELL is going on?!  He only picked up a stupid watch!

Wait.  Was that doll TALKING?  He wheels around, eyes widening as skeletons begin to MOVE, assuming ghostly visages only passingly similar to those they had in life.  The watch?  He glances to it, and then to his nakama.  And nods.

""You want this?""  He lashes out a foot at the chained doll viciously, using that turn to try to break into a run, opposite his nakama.  Sorry, fellas.  If you want this watch, you'll have to catch him.  He won't let undead tear his nakama limb from limb over a silly watch.



Nojiko finally gets the skeleton free, holding it at a distance with a look of disgust. She looks away from it and to Zoro when he barks out his order, smirking softly before yelling back to him. ""Oi! Zoro, look! Another girlfriend for you!"" She laughs and looks back to the skeleton...
 
To say she screams would be an understatement. Because the dead haven't stayed dead, and now a bunch of Bad Stuff is happening. She pushes away the ghostly creature, backing away from it in disgust. There's a reason she didn't like dolls when she was growing up, and it's not just because she was a tomboy! ""Give her back the watch!"" She echoes her sister's sentiments while glancing about the treasure for something to take up as a weapon. Hell, give her anything she wants! Stay here and keep her company even! Just let her and Nami get out of here!



There are plenty of weapons lying around for the pirates to defend themselves with. Daggers, swords, clubs, just about anything, really. It's all just another part of the great treasure stash. Unfortunately, the previous victims of the bell-trap--for it appears that's what it is--are advancing fast. One of them, now quite near Nojiko, takes a swing at her with a short scythe, a feral expression on his ghostly face. Like all the rest, he's gone silent now save for a low moaning that distantly parallels that of the bells.

Other skeletons converge on Nami and Zoro. There are two going for Zoro, one wielding dual scimitars, the other a spiked whip. The one heading for Nami has a longsword in his grip and seems quite proficient in its use. None of the weapons look (or feel!) as spectral as their bearers, either.

Luffy, though--none of the skeleton-ghosts are going for him. Instead, the doll takes another step forward, her glassy eyes burning with hatred, and lifts her cracked hand. More chains spring through the air--and now they wrap around Luffy's throat.



The shriek of the doll draws Zoro's attention and he turns to see what's happened just in time to see Luffy get grabbed by the throat. ""Luffy!"" Let go of my Captain! >_< Zoro drops the unfamiliar sword to draw one and then another from his side. His steps are stopped by the loud ringing that appears, gripping his swords tighter in an effort not to drop them and cover his ears. He can't let his swords go now of all times but that damn ringing! As the skeletons start to rise around them and take up their own weapons he realizes they have a lot more problems than they bargained for. Zoro swipes at one of the skeletons to try and get closer to the area where the girls are at, but it's obvious getting to the door will be a lot more difficult. Spotting Luffy as he runs, Zoro gets to worrying even more. ""Luffy, wait!"" Damnit, where is he going!



Don't you TOUCH her sister! ""Nojiko!"" Nami doesn't really have to cry the warning, but she does anyway. Hopefully Nojiko remembered to bring the staff Nami had given her a while back! Or at least has /some/ kind of weapon to defend herself. Nami is all ready to head towards her sister's aid, until she notices the skeleton heading towards her with the sword. ""Nn!"" Dangit. Well it's not like there aren't a lot of weapons and shields lying around if Nojiko /had/ been unarmed. As for Nami? She holds her staff up, rearranging the tacts so that the top two are in a X formation. ""Cyclone Tempo!"" She draws an arm back and Throws her arm into a forward motion; the upper tacts flipping free of the base of the staff -- and whipping /right/ past the skeleton. :O 
 
Agh, she missed? SHE MISSED? Onoes, she's doomed! Wait - no, she didn't miss. The tacts are actually boomeranging back to hit the skeleton warrior from behind; in they do hit, the impact might be enough to knock the proverbial stuffing out of 'em o_o Wait - how do you kill something that's already dead? 
 
Oh she's so going to need some aspirin when this is over. ""The bells are driving me NUTS!"" She growls; mostly to herself. ""Luffy!"" What the hell are you doing! Drop the watch!



Both Nami and Nojiko have told him to give her back the watch, which is why Luffy takes one second (only one second, which would be his second great mistake) to call over his shoulder, ""They won't let us leave!""  Even if he gave back the watch.  He's touched it, it's do or die, now.  How does he know this?

Instinct.

And it's clanging louder than the bells, so he's inclined to again put his trust in it, even in spite of the recent trouble.

Pausing to speak was, as said before, a mistake; the doll's chains have a dexterity that suggests a thing with its own life, not an inanimate object under the control of another.  He attempts to throw himself to the side and is jerked back with a hand flying to his throat, fingers trying to find purchase in the thin chain.

A few moments are spent struggling with the chain before he lashes out with an arm to hurl the shining watch at the doll.  Even if it's going to try to strangle him, he'll not go down without a fight!



Nami's cry alerts Nojiko to the swing being taken at her by one of the undead. She gasps sharply and jumps back, the blade slicing through shirt and possibly skin. She's not taking the time to check. Ya know...Nojiko hasn't been having the best of times lately. Maybe this was just what she needed -- an excuse to knock someone's head off. Literally. She reaches down into the treasure, taking up a club and letting the creature get -just- close enough before swinging it. Cut off the head and the body dies, right? Unless that body is already dead. Looks like she's having the same thought Nami's having. But the Hivemind isn't providing many solutions for a change.



Zoro brings both of his swords to his sides ready, then as the first skeleton comes at him with the dueled scimitars he blocks with one sword, pushing the blades away and then using his second sword to slash at the middle backbone area of the translucent man. If he cuts right through that spine there won't be anything holding that undead man up! Should that one be dispatched quickly, Zoro will lunge for the second carrying the whip, dodging to the side if need be to bring a katana down on that skeleton as well, now aiming from the slender neck bone to decapitate the monster. But no matter how fast he goes it won't be fast enough. The girls are handling themselves alright but he can see Luffy's problem out of the corner of his eyes.



The pocketwatch hits the doll in the face. Another tiny crack appears in her broken visage--and then something weird happens with the space around her face and upper body, and suddenly the pocketwatch is hanging around her neck, gleaming brightly. She seems not in the least bit inclined to let Luffy go. In fact, the chains begin to tighten around his throat, slowly and implacably.

At least the rest of the pirates seem to be having a decent amount of luck with the skeletons. Nami's tact whips back around on its boomerang path and slams right into her attacker. He stands there in shocked silence for a moment, then collapses in a heap of bones. The ghostly form remains standing for an instant afterwards, then promptly dissipates into nothing. But another skeleton is coming for Nami already, that of a scarred woman furiously swinging a length of spiked chain at her.

The ghost-skeleton attacking Nojiko suffers a similar fate. The ghost-form stays there for a moment after its skull is knocked off, blinking at her in puzzlement. Then it vanishes, leaving only a headless skeleton which swiftly collapses in a rattle of bones. For the moment, she manages to escape the notice of the others as well. But that's unlikely to last long.

The first of Zoro's attackers goes down easily in a clatter of bones and a sizzling fade of the ghost-form surrounding them. The swords themselves hit the ground with a clang. The second one--a wire-thin woman with bitter hatred in her translucent eyes--is a little trickier. She gets off a nasty crack of her whip at Zoro, although whether it actually hits him is up for debate. And then her head falls off. Pretty simple, really. She blinks one last time, then vanishes as her bones fall down around her.
What a time to lose your head.



He hadn't expected it to cause the doll to let him go, it was just the only thing Luffy could throw at the doll, aside from a punch.  But the gradual and unslacking constriction of the chain is crushing his windpipe closed, (rubber or no, even he needs to breathe) and breathlessness makes him drop to his knees, his other hand grasping the chain and trying to tug on it, give himself some slack.

It's useless.  The doll's strength isn't even a factor in the strangling; the chain is doing all the work -on its own-.  This was... a really bad idea, huh?  He'd -meant- well.  Luffy only meant to find her something that would perhaps cheer her up after her trees were (twice!) disturbed.

But ignorance is no escape from the undead, it seems.  What -is- this place, that it has such things in it?

Putting all his strength into his legs, Luffy stands back up and hurls himself bodily at the doll, aiming to (while blackness starts to crawl in quick around the edges of his vision) pin it down and put his fist through its cracked, porcelain -head-.

And topple over, successful or no.



Nojiko lowers the club for a moment after her opponant has vanished, enough time bought to take a deep breath. That felt pretty good actually. ""...leave me, will you?"" She mutters under her breath. Err...was she really talking about skeleton warriors there? c.c; Moving on. The yelp of her sister brings her back to the here and now. She glares at the dead woman, and while Nami works on trying to disarm her, Nojiko sends her club spinning end over end in the monster's direction. There's only room enough for two evil women in this room, and those positions are already filled!



A strike from the whip digs into his skin and slices his shirt but Zoro won't let that stop him from dispatching the second creature that attacked him. He's heaves a sigh when the woman falls to the ground, only to look and see how his nakama are fairing. Together they've rid themselves of a few, but Zoro gears up to take out some more in the mean time. He uses his two swords to block and slash when he sees an opening, but finds no reason to use one of his trained moves on these kinds of enemies.



The skeleton wielding the spiked chain lunges at Nami--then stops, her chain snared on the staff. She attempts to shake it free, but to no avail--and when it's yanked from her grasp, her hands come with it. She snarls and keeps grabbing at Nami, but she has no weapon now, and her ghostly hands pass right through the thief with no bones to back them up. It doesn't take long for Nojiko's flung club to hit her square in the back of the head. Her skull caves in, and she stumbles and falls, the translucent imagery around her fading.

Meanwhile, Zoro's dealing with the skeleton-ghosts in quantity. More of them fall to shattered pieces beneath the blows of his swords. But even as the number of opponents dwindle--there's still no way out of this strange courtyard.

As for Luffy? He's not doing so well. The chains continue to tighten mercilessly around his throat, while the doll makes vague motions with her hands, controlling them from a distance. Except suddenly it's not so much a distance, because Luffy is coming at her with that rubber fist of his at the ready.

Luffy's blow drives his fist right through the doll's cracked porcelain head. Pieces of it fly everywhere. Her dusty golden hair unravels from the scalp and falls to the ground. The doll herself teeters for a moment. The chains tighten cruelly around Luffy's throat, tight enough to crush his windpipe if he's not careful.

Then she falls, hitting the dusty cobblestone ground. When she does, the chains blocking passageway out of the labyrinth unwind rapidly until they fall on her in a heap of tarnished silver, no longer bright and shiny.

One skeleton remains, menacingly twirling an assortment of daggers as he advances on the pirates--but then a chunk of the ceiling falls out and knocks him down. He doesn't get up. Funny, that...how convenient.

No, not so convenient. Because suddenly, the whole place is shaking. The endless ringing of the bells grows to near-deafening levels, and around the pirates, the entire maze begins to crumble.

With the strange timeless magic of the doll no longer in effect, the leaning clocktower is finally toppling.



""Eeye..!"" Nami shakes her staff and shudders when ghostly hands pass through her arms in an attempt to grasp her. Unwinding the chain from around her staff, she drops it, looking up and around, ""Nojiko, are yo-""
CLUNK.
The sound of a piece of ceiling hitting one of the undead and killing it ded..er.. gets Nami's attention. So does the rumbling. ""... GODDAMNIT Luffy, I told you t-"" No, now is not the time to lecture. ""We have to get out of here!"" She scoops up her bag full of treasures -- like HELL she's leaving that here after what they went through. ""ZORO!"" Time to go! ""Nojiko, come on."" Nami tucks her staff back in place and tugs for her sister's wrist. Escape! Escaaaaaaaape! Agh, she can barely hear herself THINK let alone yell - she hopes Zoro's paying attention, so he knows to follow them.



Luffy's...

...Well, there's not much to say about someone lying face down on the ground, but his head is slightly turned, but with his hat askew and his hair in his face, it's hard to see what his expression is, at first.

One arm's pinned underneath him, but the other is splayed out on the ground, fingers twitching.  Not to try to loosen the chain around his throat - that, he already knows is a useless attempt.  He knows something's wrong with his throat, tasting copper at the back of his mouth and between his teeth, and thinks it might mean he won't be able to breathe even if the chain had loosened.

Well, that's alright, if they're okay.  Under the shade of his hat, he closes his eyes.  It's the strangest thing, but this feels so much more like slipping away than...

Yes!  It's time to run, except, uh, aren't they missing someone?  Their missing fourth is not getting up.



""I'm fine, is every--"" Nojiko's question is likewise cut short by the ominous rumbling. She knows what that means: time to haul ass kids! Nami doesn't have to tell her twice, though she's tugged along by the wrist anyway. She cringes as they hurry along to get out of there, half-certain that at any moment a piece of that strange place is going to crush them from above. ""Zoro! Luffy!"" It's then that she realizes that she hadn't been able to pay much attention to the plight of the two guys during the fight, and that cold fear starts to grip her and say it might be too late to check on them now. She glances back over her shoulder as they run, seeing only the place falling apart. It's okay, she tells herself, looking forward again to concentrate on their escape. Those two could survive just about anything. Except...they've both already died once. o.o; Not the best time to remember that!




Zoro strikes down yet another skeleton, the bones crumbling at his feet. He then turns to look up at the ceiling as things start to shake. Oh great. This whole place is going to collapse! On top of that there's all that noise again! Hearing Nami's shout he nods, watching to see that the girls are on their way but first running back into the room to go after Luffy. He can't just leave his Captain here! Dead or not! Zoro slices through another skeleton, then leaps and makes a downward slash, sending a wave of air that's like a blade itself out at the skeletons to part the seas of enemies so he can land near Luffy. A final dash and his katana is brought down to cut right through the now rusted chain that attached Luffy to the doll. With that cut Zoro gets to one knee next to Luffy, ""Oi, hang on!"" He puts one katana away to remove the chain from around Luffy's throat and then hoist the rubber boy over his shoulder. ""You dumb ass. You'd better not be dead..."" Zoro will be -extremely- pissed off at you! Not to mention... "".. or I'll make sure you never live it down that you got your ass kicked by a dolly."" Hah! As he turns to run out of the cavern he can hope that now that the doll is dead the skeletons will fall over too!




Now the walls are crumbling around them as well as the ceiling. Flashes of sky can occasionally be seen in glimpses at the corner of one's eye--but never any way to get there. Rusted gears fall over or explode in fragments as the pirates run by--it's all too possible for one to be struck with the flying shrapnel. Choking marble dust fills the air. There are no more skeletons, and no more chains attempt to foil Our Heroes--but it's still a perilous flight, with chunks of marble and ancient metal falling down all around them.

And always, there is the ceaseless tolling of the bell, multiplied a thousandfold, all the echoes chiming off each other in terrible discord. They sound almost hysterical now, and the very sound of them is maddening.

And then suddenly there is silence. For a moment, it might seem as if they've all gone deaf. Then the cloud of dust begins to dissipate, and it becomes clear that they are free. Behind them lies the crumbled ruins of the clocktower, now completely fallen over, its glass face crazed with cracks.

Above them, the sky is that bleached shade of blue that it seems to be throughout the Crescent. Below them, the ground is grey cobblestone and white marble. The broken old city around them stands in silence.




""They'll be fine! They're both stupidly strong -!"" Nami calls -- doing her damndest to shake off the vague sense of unease that settles at the pit of her stomach like a rotten orange. MOre than once she looks over her shoulder at the same time as Nojiko.. worry and anxiety playing across her face. Come on.. COME ON..! Don't tell her they got lost in there? They're goofing off at a time like this? The marble dust rising up almost chokes her as she breathes in the frenzied flight, and more than once she has to either jerk to a stop or dive forward to avoid falling debris. Got to get out. Get out. GET OUT. The bells. THE BELLS. THe ceaseless tolling of the goddamned BELLS. What's up with ( ..and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee ) that? 
 
The sudden thought that interrupts her original thought process causes Nami to stumble, right out the exit, eyes wide in surprise. What the hell would make her think of that all of a sudden? Exhaustion and a loss of adrenaline causes her to collapse to her knees, panting, and it isn't until she hears no more bells (the silence, the blessed blessed SILENCE) that Nami looks over her shoulder, to see Nojiko, Zoro and.....Luffy. Only their Captain isn't walking of his own power; he's being carried. And as much as Nami would like to believe it's because he got conked on the head or something, there's something in Zoro's face that ..says otherwise.
 
So Nami looks away, gritting her teeth, fists clenching as she fixes her gaze on the ground. Not the ruins, not the ... not the... ""......"" Nami gets to her feet again. 
 
Dont' look back.
 
"".. let's go."" This to Nojiko and Zoro, as Nami slings her bag of treasure back over shoulder. Back to the Going Merry. It's true that Luffy will be back. But what kind of a heartless individual would you have to be to /not/ be upset by a friend being killed? Especially...when it was your idea to come in the first place? o O ( Somehow.... these treasures don't..seem worth it anymore. ) Wow. There /must/ be something wrong with her to think something like /THAT/.

Another fish, whole, is eaten. Crunch. ""Priests are the ... um .. ava .. ..chosen of a particular god to go around telling people what that god's will is."" Swallow. ""And before you go all 'oh, there aren't any gods' or 'I don't believe in them', you better start believing, because they're real here, they exist, and they have priests."" Merry is not making this up! But apparently she fully expects Terra to do what so many others do and claim they aren't real.

The fish that goes flying is caught, after a moment of scrambling, and set back on the counter with a wet thwap. ""I didn't think so. He reminded me a lot of that .. um. Guy."" What was his name. Think, think. ""The one with the really big sword."" That probably won't help any. ""Very focused on what he's doing. ..Ne, are you bleeding, Nojiko-san?"" You're staring at your finger. o.o



Terra shrugs. ""Merry, you would be very surprised. I've seen a hundred bunnies spraying out of a top hat, giant men made of cinder blocks and a psycho shadow person. You need a band-aid for that, Nojiko?""

And of course, Terra really has no trouble with it all. She wants to know more about Oilbird, who chatted to her on her entry because Edward was bored that night, and to know as much as she can about the world. One thing she doesn't know about the world is where the bandages are, though. Unfortunately.



Nojiko stares at her thumb for a moment longer. She feels a slight sting where the knife slipped and slid across her flesh, but not a single crimson droplet appears. ""I'm fine."" She finally answers with a smile and even holds her thumb up to show them. ""It's not even bleeding, see?"" Yeah, she won this round. Nojiko reaches for the last fish, holding it up to have a good long look at it. ""I bet this one was pretty cute swimming through the water."" And blue eyes. That's a little strange for a fish, isn't it? Noji's eyes narrow as she slaps it down against the cutting board. The knife is grabbed up again, its shiny silver blade slid along the fish's stomach. Slice, insert, twist. Now it's gutless. How appropriate. u.u;



Outside the common room, in which lies the kitchen, whipstaff steering, and platform labeled 'Usopp's Workshop', out on the deck a wooden hatch opens. Someone emerges, closes it behind him, takes the stairs up to the door and...

WHUMP. Did someone just hit the door?

It creaks open, and one rather disheveled youth in a straw hat sort of tumble-rolls in and sprawls. "".....""

""Hara heta..."" =_= ""...I'm so hungry I could die,"" wails the youth in the straw hat, who cracks open an eye and blinks at the only other unfamiliar face present. ""...Huh? Who are you?"" o_o;



Terra o.o s at Nojiko waving the fish around. And here is the man himself! Terra jumps when Luffy appears on the scene, and runs up to meet him. She puts her fish tools down first, of course. 

""Monkey D. Luffy, I presume? I'm Terra, good to meet you!"" is her crow, followed by a big handshake that could, you know, probably wobble Luffy's arm like a strip of rubber. ""I'm Terra. I'm your new assistant cook! I've really heard a lot about you... Priest of Hoatzin, King of the Pirates...""

Chibi scene, if you care to imagine it. There's Pirate Terra and Chibi Luffy, sailing the seas. Terra shakes the boat and it sinks like a stone. Then it jumps back up again on a pillar of mud! ""I've already met all of your crew.""



Waving fish about only makes Merry hungry too, and she's been snacking since she got here! As Luffy falls in, dying from hunger, the tiny merchild grabs a fish from her 'cleaned' pile and offers it to the starving captain. ""Here. I think it's tuna."" Well, it's fish anyway, and raw. ""..I have a prettier one, Nojiko!"" Whereupon she goes rummaging through the fishie corpses, and comes up with a very brightly colored red, yellow and orange fish, which dangles limply in her hands. ""See?""

And then Terra speaks, and Merry frooowns. ""She's lying, she hasn't met everyone. And she tried to steal my potatos yesterday.""



Nojiko smirks in the captain's direction, both at his appearance and words. Somehow she doubts he could be hungry enough to actually -die-. It can't have been too many hours since the last meal or multiple snack. But she doesn't doubt that it -feels- that way to him. Maybe Luffy's stomach is made of rubber too and stretched completely out of shape. ""I'll fix you something."" Because she doesn't want Merry teaching him to eat whole, raw fish. Though it would probably come closer to making Merry sick than it would Luffy with that cast iron gut of his. She pauses as Terra starts to introduce herself, shooting a glance to Luffy before turning away with a smirk and getting to work on fixing some of that fish. o/` Somebody's gonna get it.... o/`



""................""

Luffy blinks at his arm, blinks at Terra, blinks at his arm again, and slowly picks himself up to sit on the floor, wearing an expression that isn't exactly one to inspire confidence in any assumptions that he has any idea what the FLYING FLOCK IS GOING ON. He brings up his other hand and carefully adjusts the straw hat on his head, staring.

He grins uneasily, ""Ahehe. I see, I see--"" Belatedly, what she says sinks in, and he tears his hand away, standing up. ""--WHAAAT?!"" How? When? He doesn't remember asking for an assistant cook! ....... (Did he get drunk or something? Jeez.)

""I'm not king of the pirates yet! I don't even know you, you're not one of my nakama! What the hell is going on?!"" A sudden stop, and he crosses his arms, nodding. ""Oh... This must be another of that weird bird's funny visions. SA, DETEKOI HOATZIN! Joke's over!""

And then the tossed fish hits him in the side of the head.



Terra blinks blinks blinks blinks. ""Um.""


""Sanji gave me the jjob, if that helps. What's nakama mean?""

She pinches her arm experimentally. She must be losing her touch. Ohhh, this doesn't look good.



Tremble before the flying fish! Which really just adds to the surreality of it all, doesn't it? Merry blinks once or twice, considering all this trouble before coming to the conclusion that she has no idea what's really going on here, and returns to gutting fish. She feels kind of bad for the next one, because it looks like it has a bow on its nose. ""..Ne, Nojiko, is it okay to gut a fish that's watching you?"" The fish wiggles a little, mouth opening and closing.



Why are Nojiko's shoulders trembling? She's not crying again, is she? She swore she wouldn't do that anymore! But no, it's quite the opposite emotion having that effect on her as she listens to everything that's going on. ""What's that Merry-chan?"" She finally composes herself enough to look in the girl's direction, spotting the fish and understanding her question then. ""Ahh...why don't you decide that one?"" She smiles gently and nods, letting Merry have the final word on if that particular fish is gutted or tossed back overboard. ""I think we'd have plenty without it."" She does note, sliding the fish she'd been frying in a wok onto a plate. That should take the edge off Luffy's hunger! ""Ne, I think I'll step outside for some air."" Nojiko nods, placing a hand briefly on Luffy's shoulder on her way by. What's with the laughing as soon as she's outside the door though? Maybe Nojiko's finally snapped from all her heartbreak-induced trauma! Nah...



(( Sanji gave me the job )) Luffy rubs his head where the fish had hit him, looking up from where he'd been eyeing the thrown fish, which now rests in the other hand. He tosses the fish back to the table Merry's working on, wipes his hand on the side of his denim shorts and ...blinks. There's a lot of that going on. ""......""

Then, the proverbial lightbulb goes on. It must've been a ticklish experience from disuse in his brain, because he bursts out LAUGHING, doubling over with arms wrapped around his stomach. ""Ho-hehehehehe--Hoatzin! Pop quiz?"" He straightens up, putting a fist into his open palm, as if realizing something. He's suddenly serious, or pretending to be. ""'The distinction between friends, strangers, enemies, nakama.' This ship is the home of my nakama, my most precious people."" He looks to Nojiko and grins. ""Okay.""

He turns away and retrieves the fish she'd cooked, picking it apart so it'll cool faster. After a moment, he peers over his shoulder. Blinking, surprised, he says, ""What? Hoatzin, the illusion's still here. You can go away now, you don't exist."" Sagenod. o_o Yes, he thinks you're a hallucination. ""Sanji doesn't have an assistant.""



To represent adequately this, imagine Terra shattering into small pieces. Wow. That's gotta be one of the hardest put-downs she's ever had. ""I don't exist?"" she replies weakly. ...ok. Fine by her. ""Fine by me.""

A noise can be heard outside, should anyone bother to look out of a window, as a large platform made of sea mud and sand solidifies outside of the ship. ""If you want me to leave, I'll go,"" Terra replies quietly, and opens the window!



Merry studies the fish for a long moment before getting to her feet and filling up one of the large pots with water, and putting the fish inside of it. Only -then- does she try to take it out of the sink and discovers the pot's a little too heavy even for her unnatural strength, at this angle. A stool is kicked over quickly and climbed up on, whereupon she levers the pot (and fish, now swimming) up onto the counter. Nojiko's leaving draws a cheery wave - now that Luffy's here, she doesn't /have/ to watch Terra, nobody scrutinizes people better than Luffy!

..?

""Luffy-sama, is it okay for a pirate to have a pet fish?"" They had Seadra, kind of, but that wasn't really quite the same thing, was it? Maybe they should just eat the fish instead, or throw it overboard or something. She's really not entirely sure of what to do with it, though she doesn't have problems with eating things still alive. Hrm. The mud thing earns a long, looong stare. ""I think the mud is trying to attack us, captain. How do you fight mud?"" Had Terra spoken louder, she might have heard the Titan, but she's distracted by slooowly scraping the pot towards the edge of the counter. ""Or maybe it's trying to eat my fish, or the thieflady.""



Those portholes are really small, you sure that's wise, Terra? There's always, you know... the door. Which isn't being blocked. And the room is really small, so it's only a few extra steps! Trying to squeeze out of a porthole isn't all that necessary, when so much energy could be spared by just walking out the door. Luffy starts popping a few steaming pieces of fish in his mouth, blinking at the 'illusionary girl'. The noise outside? He'll look when he's done eating. The ship isn't shaking, so it's probably nothing he should worry about.

""What,"" he laughs suddenly, ""You mean Sanji would just make a stranger nakama without talking to me first? Come on, Hoatzin, this is a little cruel. Stop the vision already."" Dealing with the loss of Arlen has been tough enough to deal with. ""....Hidoi darou,"" he says flatly, turning his attention to the plate.

A pause, and he pushes the plate away, leaning on his elbow and propping his chin on a hand. e_e Man, the last few days? Have TOTALLY sucked. He's convinced Hoatzin's trying to tell him something. He's made it clear he thinks it's an illusion, a vision, a hallucination. In light of this, how Terra or Merry take his response is entirely up to them.



Unfortunately for you, Luffy, Terra's had her share of this in the past. By mistake, the error has been made of being just like many, many people who've chased her out of towns, foster homes, other teams- he didn't mean it, of course, but given her up-and-down emotions it's enouigh to push her in that specific direction.

Terra has her methods of getting around. She, being very small, squeezes through... somehow... and lands on a floating platform of mud.

""One day,"" she comments to herself. ""New record.""



Merry deals with Luffy's response by throwing a spoon at Luffy's head. Primarily to get his attention, because her pot with her fish is about to fall off the counter, and that'll be a really big mess! ""If everything else is a vision, I'm not! Help me with this, it'll fall over!"" It's hard to try to balance her pot -and- watch Terra creep out of the porthole (and she had trouble getting out those herself) *AND* watch the mud for impending attack since Luffy seemed to think it didn't exist. Luffy was a bit strange sometimes, she decides. Hoatzin made him twitch too much. ""And that mud outside is real too, captain."" Tug. Tug. She should have gotten a smaller pot. ""And now that thief is out the porthole. Do you think the mud will eat her?""



That's an unfortunate track record.

Fortunately, Luffy is no legitimate factor to add to that list, but if it appeases consciences to do so, then all the better for Terra, hm? The Going Merry has seen a number of intrusions, to nakama and ship both. Thieves, ninjas, gunslingers. Great betrayals and property damage lately. Naturally, Luffy isn't in the most stellar of moods, and thinking Hoatzin is testing his definition of 'nakama' at this, of all times, isn't helping.

WHAP. Luffy blinks, rubbing at his forehead. ""Hey! Why'd you throw that at me?"" Oh. Fish! Fish falling! He stretches out an arm to catch it, puts it firmly on the table, and ...stares at Merry. ""What? It is?"" Luffy goes to the window to check. ""....So the girl is real, too?"" Uh, oops. ""WAIT. SANJI HIRED HER?!"" Without asking. -_-; ""OI OI.""



""Thank you~"" Luffy's so helpful! Merry hops off her perch and trots over to the table and peers into the pot, where the fish is still swimming actively about. Good, it was okay. ""...Yup. Yesterday he told her to, but I don't think it's a good idea, she's a thief and she's after our treasures."" Merry just ... isn't letting go of that impression, is she? Children are remarkably tenacious in bad ways. ""She's lulling everyone into a false sense of peace! She even tricked Nami into not killing her when she messed around with the trees.""



The priest of Griffin Vulture is not a hallucination either, for the record. And at least he's dressed, this time; new clothing can do a lot for...well, Albedo's always had a strong sense of self-importance and dignity, so it's just sort of nice to not be wandering around in a constant state of ""hmm, slightly drafty"".

Albedo isn't familiar with local custom on whether or not you can just walk onto someone's ship, but dimly remembered childhood films point at the idea you need to ask for permission. (Pff, human customs.) That certainly explains why he's standing out near the Going Merry's moorings, looking just slightly silly as he listens to the goings-on inside. And why is he doing this, instead of coming aboard? ...Well, it occured to him there was a /specific/ greeting you had to make, and...he can't remember.



""Whatever, kid,"" replies Terra, who, as Luffy may or may not be surprised to note, is in fact hovering on a large piece of mud. She can swim, and everything. Haha, loser. Just wait until Elastigirl arrives in the dream, then you'll feel inferior. ""Just... whatever,"" she continues, and moves away from the porthole. And then she spots Albedo, down there. ""Oh, hi. Here to do some more fishing?"" she asks.



...Huh. You see something new every day. Albedo doesn't seem all that surprised by Terra's trick with the mud, though; you live with U-DO in your brain for fourteen years, and find out you're still hallucinating even after your link to it is severed, you get around to expecting that weird stuff happens. ""Hm?"" the priest asks, tipping his head back to look up at her. ""No. Here to ask after Nojiko."" Her emotions are an open book right now, and--he smirks, with just a little cruelty behind it. ""Kicked out already, huh? Did you burn breakfast?""



Luffy closes the porthole window and nudges the latch shut, turning to look at Merry with his back against the wall. (( Thank you~ )) ""Ii ...zo,"" he says slowly, folding one arm over his stomach and idly scratching his cheek with the finger of the other hand, thoughtfully. ""I don't know if she's a thief."" Nami. She's a navigator, but also a thief. ""Not enough there for that."" There's no motive, perhaps except survival. He's not quantifying treasure. He's quantifying the force of personality that his instinct is suggesting to him.

They're pirates. Not therapists. They pick nakama for nakama, not out of a sense of pity, not out of wanting to make up for someone's tragic past. They're pirates, they've all had a taste of victory and loss. What would be the point of playing pissing contests? My life was worse? My past was more tragic? I've felt more loss than you could ever understand? My friend could eat your friend for breakfast?

Honestly, what would be the point? With someone holding to a worldview as utterly simple as Luffy, there's no room for things like that. 'Muri desu'.

""If she touched Nami's trees, I know Nami took care of things in the best way for her."" That's the kind of faith he has in his navigator, or any of his nakama. ""I'll talk to Sanji later. I'm going below."" He lifts his head and grins at her. ""As for cooking the fish, I leave it to you, na? Ja na. Merry.""

The door to the common room opens, and as Luffy emerges, he looks only once at Albedo, nods soberly, one Priest to another, and hops over the rail to pull open one of the hatch doors and slip belowdeck.



Of course, things aren't like that at all, and it will probably be a long-standing misunderstanding for quite some time. Just unfortunate circumstances and all that, you know? Terra wasn't looking for pity, more something to do; that Luffy hit a nerve with her in his odd fashion can just be put down to bad luck. Oh, how sad, never mind!

Terra unfortunately does not share this belief, and scowls at Albedo. ""It's none of your business, you bleached bozo,"" she snaps, hurling a clod of mud at him. She ponders either hovering off or heading back into town. But she can't rent a room for the night... sleeping on the beach again it is, then.



""..Aa. Okay."" There's a bit of unexpected sobriety going on, but she's getting used to the change in her nakama. She isn't sure she likes it, but she can get used to it. ""I'll have dinner ready in a few hours!"" It'll take her that long to cook everything. She's passable, but not spectacular. It won't be the best meal the crew's eaten, though it'll be edible at least. Merry offers a salute briefly, grinning back, before falling back into vaguely worried silence, watching her fish. Hm.



Temper, temper. Let it be known it's a bad idea to sulk around the priest of Griffin Vulture; he has very little patience for it, and a past /no one/ wants to know about lurking behind those purple eyes and that feline smile. He knows the mud's coming before Terra even throws it (wise to the immature minds of children, this one), and so has an ether circuit already open. A quiet word, before the air right around Albedo bursts into flames, reducing the mud to little more than sand and fine dust. He steps through the settling cloud, shaking his head to get some of it out of his hair, and quirks a brow at Terra's departing back.

The temptation to go after her and show her why it is a very, very poor idea to do that to him is strong. Albedo lays it aside, though, and shakes his head once. ""Children.""

About to be expected from Oilbird's chosen, anyhow. He turns his attention back to the Going Merry, raising a hand in idle salute to Luffy, before stepping aboard the ship. He wouldn't've remembered the words, anyway. ...now, /where/ would Nojiko be?



""Nojiko's... around here somewhere,"" Terra mentions as she leaves. ""We were cleaning up fish earlier. Now I smell of fish, too, BB's gonna k..."" 

Considering that statement in retrospect, she balls her hands up into fists, grinds her teeth, and hovers off, depositing the mud somewhere and walking down the pier.



All Albedo's going to find aboard is another child! And the captain belowdecks. Which may amount to the same thing. Merry's sensitivity is a strange thing onboard this ship, and at an unfamiliar tread on the decking, she cautiously sidles out the door and peers around, knife gripped tightly in one hand. Terra's leaving (and mud; Merry will assume she ate a Devil Fruit and ponder it later) can't be the source of it, she's not on deck. Ara. Another step. Peer. ..Oh, hey, it's the wierd ossan, and he has clothes this time. Merry takes a wary sniff of the air.



Just cinnamon, this time, and the lingering scent of saltwater and dust. Scrubbing one's own skin off does wonders for getting rid of scent. Merry's sudden appearance on deck doesn't come as much of a surprise; Albedo raises a hand in absent greeting. ""Hello, Merry."" No mention of yesterday; he's probably already forgotten bits of it. ""Is Nojiko around anywhere?""



""..Hello."" Merry hasn't forgotten ANY of yesterday, though most of it she didn't understand. Such was the breaks of the game, wasn't it? At least he wasn't stinky this time. ""Not right now, I think she might have gone shopping. She should be back in a little bit though."" The fishy knife is stuck through her belt for now, whereupon she leans on a bit of railing and peers alertly down at Griffin Vulture's priest. Luffy was the only other priest she knew, and they didn't seem similar at all. ""...ne, have you made an appointment with a doctor? There are lots around. They're even free in the Golden Hall, sometimes.""



""Oh, did she? I'm sorry for intruding, then."" See? Albedo can be a nice person. Or maybe he's just indulging Merry because she looks like a Kirschwasser. Either way, though, he turns as if to leave the ship--maybe to lurk outside and wait for Nojiko to appear, or go see if there's anyone in the port who needs his particular gift... And then Merry makes the doctor comment. ""Hm? What for?"" He glances down at himself. ""Did I not notice a broken bone, or something?"""

In spite of the fact of it not being at all that late, when you're tired, you're tired. So while most of the rest of the crew are already fast asleep downstairs, Nami is wide awake; for two reasons. One; technically its her watch. And two? ...because tonight is the night she leaves. She'd only just returned from Clara's a face minutes ago, to ensure that the woman would cover for her if anyone found Nami missing. And they most assuredly will, sooner or later. Preferably later. Right now she's standing at one of her favorite parts of the boat - the railing just to the left of Mary, gazing out over the sea with a narrowed, speculative gaze. o O ( Just one job, and it'll be done. .. .. or so they said anyway. But they're pirates -- and not the good kind, like Luffy. I can't trust their word. )



Luffy had suggested they take the ship a little further from Golden Hall and dock there.  While it was less convenient, for trips to and from the village, once the captain had enough reason (Merry said the wood might warp on the Going Merry, he'd noticed Nami taking particular care of Bellemere's trees, and not to mention it was getting uncomfortably -hot- at all hours thanks to the ceaseless sunshine) it was worth the extra commute.

So it's in a kind of half-light that's too bright to be called proper twilight that the Going Merry rests at anchor on the water, a ramp laid to a temporary floating dock near the shore.

Otherwise, the ship is quiet, no sign of the usual chaos when certain of the crewmates are up to no good.  And why would there be?  They're all asleep.

All, at least, except for the navigator on watch.  And one more.  ""You can sit there, if you want.""

It's Luffy.  ""I won't mind.""




Further away from Golden Hall was A-OK with Nami. Further away meant further away from where her old crew was docked. She can't even see its flag from here, but she knows it's there. It's the peaceful quiet of the evening that Nami loves best. When she knows. KNOWS her friends are resting, and safe - when sometimes she would - when it was her night to watch - stand in the doorway of the women's quarters to talk with Robin, or to watch the other girls sleeping. Or even to check and see that the guys hadn't killed themselves in their sleep, believe it or not. 
 
Nami doesn't know if Usopp found out about his stolen dials - but the dials weren't the only things she stole from him. She feels..bad about it, but it's necessary. And she certainly couldn't ask him straight out for these things. Resting her chin against a hand, Nami almost jumps out of her skin at the sudden voice. (( You can sit there, if you want. I won't mind. ))
 
Nami half turns towards the Captain of the Going Merry, a hesitant smile that grows in strength on her face, "".. Luffy. What... are you doing awake still?"" She asks, quietly. It hasn't impacted on just what he'd said - Mary was /his/ seat. His special seat no less. ANd the last time Nami was on that was when he dragged her out of her room ad plopped her down on it, for some weird reason. But still, considering how ballistic he gets when other people have the audacity to sit there ... it's surprising. But then, this is probably another nakama thing, so she shouldn't be that surprised.



Did you know, Nami, that your habit of checking on your nakama when they weren't looking had rubbed off on others?  That when you and Zoro were dead, set adrift on rafts for Davey Jones to take back those who belonged to the sea, it'd been Luffy shadowing those steps, those same doorways?  In times that safety is put into danger, everyone deals with it in their own ways.  But you, you'll keep moving through fever or the threat of blackmail to keep your nakama safe.  You can't 'send someone flying' with your fists, so you do what you can in the ways you're familiar with.

And that's...

...probably why Luffy's finding himself so confused these days, when he's trying to work out just why Nami's smiles ring a note 'off'.  Or why she seems so on edge.  Like now, here on the Going Merry, their home on the ocean said to be Thunderbird's domain.

Luffy's favorite seat is something jealously guarded, but just like (( Nami, want a piece of meat?  Only one, though. )) some other things said before it's his own fumbling attempts to cheer her up the only ways he knows how.  ""Can't sleep,"" answers the pirate, who folds his arms up behind his head, under the brim of his straw hat, glancing off, briefly, in the direction Nami had been staring.

""...""  Instinct.  It's saying addressing his concerns directly would just have her shy away from it.  ""Gonna sit or what?""




She didn't know, no! But she'd have been surprised. Luffy always seems to be the goofy, dopey Captain they loved so. . to see those random moments of intuition; it's eerie. Nami knows she can't fight the same way the others do. And .. she also knows she should tell them. Before she finds herself in over her head, or before they find out themselves. Absently, she lifts her head to the kerchief covering her hair, where she keeps the newspaper clipping, almost possessively protective. Desperate to /not/ have her friends know about it.
 
It isn't that she's ashamed. It's..
 
.... Nami doesn't know what it is. Half the time she's confused about what to do, and the other half she can see it so clearly it scares her. (( Gonna sit or what? )) Nami smiles lightly, lifting a hand in a dismissive gesture, ""No no, I'm fine."" If she sits, she might get tired, and she can't afford falling asleep. ""Ne.."" There's a distinct lump in her stomach she's trying to work around - finding it exceedingly difficult to get the /important/ words out. She'd never turn to him and say, 'Help me' again. She's not .. 
 
She can handle this. She can protect them her own way. They don't have to know. ""..you.. could probably ask Sanji-kun for maybe some warm milk? Or ask Chopper if he has a sleeping draught for you. It's quiet out - only one person needs to be awake.""



Oh, he spends a lot of time being an insufferable moron, driving people up the proverbial wall with his childish and idiotic antics, but there's one funny fact about being as simple as Luffy is: He can ignore all the superfluous stuff that would distract most people from the root of a problem, and when something doesn't ring right, that's something that makes him scratch his head and wonder for a while.  Unfortunately, in that same vein of thought, being so simple often makes more complex situations, like this, absolutely baffling to the Straw Hat captain.

And sometimes, it's bothersome enough to have sleep elude him, even for a little while.

(( Ne.. ))  ""Nn?""  He shakes his head.  ""They're asleep.  What, I'm not doing anything!  I promise, I'll be good.""  No troublemaking.  He'll sit on the rail and behave, just let him hang out a little longer?  ""Only until I'm sleepy.""

Her hand on the kerchief draws his attention, and he grins, noting lightheartedly, ""What you're wearing, Nami,"" he chuckles quietly, ""Reminds me of the first time we met.  Remember?""  Sea spray and a summer sun.  They both had places to go, no time to waste with 'hello', and it was some time later that they exchanged names at all.



Nami grins at the promise to be good; enough to giggle a little. ""Haihai, all right."" As if he needed permission. But considering Nami wouldn't hesitate to drag him off and throw him down to his room if he bothered her, maybe he did! She straightens a little, to give Luffy more of her attention. Surely the sea breeze will make him drowsy soon, right? SHe lowers her hand, leaning on the railing instead, a warm grin on her face at the reminder. ""Aa, I remember."" How could she forget? Luffy had a rather.. unique arrival. o O ( Back then, I thought you were just like the other pirates. I thought you were stupid, untrustworthy.. I didn't care about you or anyone else. Just Kokoyashi. But now.. ) Things change. 
 
Furrowing her brow, she turns her head, glancing away from Luffy - it's not that she's guilty, or feels bad about what she's doing. It's for their sakes, so it's all right, right? ""Hrrm. It was such a long time ago."" And yet she would never forget any of those precious memories. Her expression sours slightly. Her crew was strong enough to take care of themselvse; they couldn't possibly have anything to worry about in regards to her old crew. But at the same time, the idea that her nakama would be in danger .. they should be allowed their peace right? They only just came back from Middleton recently, Luffy himself was hurt.. ""How's your throat?"" Nami asks suddenly, remembering as she looks back to the Captain speculatively.



As if remembering only now, Luffy brings a hand up over his throat with a blank expression, and then leans back on his arm, swinging a leg off the rail with a grin, his hand lifting to aim a thumbs-up.  ""Ii zo.""  The garotte welt is fading, but he's always been very quick to bounce back from any injuries, though most of the time, quite literally.

Things change.  ""You're not sick or anything, are you?""  And this one's rather abrupt, but Luffy... he's unsure of just -what- feels wrong, and that's all his instinct, while Hoatzin is agitatedly silent.  He's eliminating options for suspicion.  She -seems- like she's trying to work on something hard, but she doesn't seem like she's struggling with a fever.  No, rather, more like... Like she's trying to be brave for someone.  Everyone.  Carrying something alone.

He really doesn't like it.  This is not to say her efforts are going unappreciated; he doesn't like the effect it has on their navigator.




""Don't fall."" It's like a knee-jerk reaction, the concerned warning coming before she even realizes it. Not that she expects Luffy to fall. His balance is /insane/. At the response to her question though, Nami smiles back, leaning against the railing and glancing down into the water. ""Sick?"" Nami echoes, surprised by the abrupt question, enough to stare at Luffy incredulously. ""Of course not."" Her smile widens further, ""Don't worry so much."" A low chuckle. o O ( Isn't he sleepy /yet/? If he doesn't rest soon, I'm going to have to take drastic steps.. )



If he wasn't so absorbed in the puzzle set before him (namely, what on the Gameboard could be eating Nami), Luffy might have resorted to an act of mischief, like pretending to tip himself off the other side of the rail or something.  Instead, he only shakes his head with a small smile, hand moving to the back of his head and scratching idly.  He won't fall!  Unless he's knocked overboard, but that'd take some doing considering he could stretch to grab the side of the ship and spare himself a lot of wetness.

(( Sick? ))  ""Aa.""  (( Of course not.  Don't worry so much. ))  ""Sou ka.  Yokatta na.""  Okay.  Good.

For the next few moments, he's turned his attention to the sea.  Not speculatively, per se.  Just the way he usually watches it, as if he saw something just beyond the horizon, something that promised ample reason to live every moment -today- like it was his last.  ""Na, Nami.""  Investigating again.  ""Are you sure you're okay?""    



Oh good gravy, if he had done that, Nami would probably have freaked out and grabbed him ;.; Baka Captain ;.;!! At the question, Nami..actually doesn't answer right away. Finding sudden interest in whatever lies beneath the sea - coral, fishies, treasure. o O ( Tell him, Nami. It's not too late; you can still back out of this... they put their lives on the line for you when you were in a similar situation ..back with Arlong. You /know/ they'd help you ... )
 
( But... ) O o Nami half closes her eyes, inwardly sighing. o O ( If it's for them, I'm fine. They don't need to know. I ...can take care of it. This once, I can protect -them-. ) She straightens instead, turning away and starting to wander idly in the opposite direction of the railing. ""Ne, Luffy.. you know.."" 
 
TELL HIM.
 
She absently rubs at her collarbone, stops dead at the center of the boat, and places her hand against the mast. o O ( Okay..worst case scenario.. I'll have to do more than one job. I might have to keep on with them, to keep the guys here safe. ..but .. is that all right? )



Nami, when you say 'I love mikan and money' and then go around throwing yourself in harm's way for your nakama, you're making your reputation very hard to live up to; which is probably why Luffy doesn't get worried about how deep in financial debt he is with her, and typically laughs off the growing interest rate. ._.;  Maybe, to his simple-minded worldview, he's taken it to be a term of endearment or something.

(( Ne, Luffy.. you know.. ))

""Hm?""

She's quiet a little too long, and there's something about that stance that strikes a dissonant chord with the captain.  Who takes off his straw hat and turns it over and over in his hands, between his knees, leaning forward with a small frown.

Finally, hat in hand, he hops off the rail and takes a few steps forward, ""What is it?""



Or maybe just a way to make sure her nakama stay near her; even after they fulfill their dreams. Make it impossible for them to pay off their debts, so she won't be alone. So in a way, yes, it is sort of a term of endearment. (What, the higher the debt, the more she cares?) o O ( Aren't you tired, Luffy? I don't... )
 
No, she didn't want to do this. At all. Her fingers curl into a slow fist against the grain of the wood, but she tilts her head as she hears Luffy approaching. ""I.."" Mental block. Say it, don't say it. Leave, don't leave. It all boils down to their protection; their safety. Nami glances up at the sky absently. 
 
A small nod. She turns, her smile nothing short of strained, as she laughs tightly and pads forward to meet Luffy halfway, hands clasped behind her back; one hand slipping beneath the back of her shirt, ""...nandemo..nai."" She answers finally. A glance goes over his left shoulder, expression twitching away from a frown, and she finally steps up to pull the Captain - rather roughly - into a tight hug with one arm. Get over here!



It's a cruel game they've played with your loyalty, Nami.  Do this for us, (( Your dreams or theirs. )) or we'll tell them everything.  Do that for us, (( If you bring 100,000,000 beli before my eyes... )) or we'll hurt them.  And while you're protecting the safety of your nakama, they desperately want to do the same for you.  So what can he do, when he can't out of ignorance?

Stop -fighting- him.

A mental wince accompanies the sight of -that- particular smile, but instinct is having a slow time of reaching his expression, which is blankly confused, a little taken aback.  ""A--""  Luffy blinks past her shoulder at the one-armed hug, his hat dangling from his fingers.

It's so unlike you to--

""What's wrong?"" carries just a small note of real concern.  What -is- it?  Who does he have to beat up?  Returning it's more a case of putting a hand atop her head with an awkward half-smile, something that hesitates when he feels the crinkle of something under that kerchief.  ""...?""



When it comes to everything that Luffy and the others have done for her, Nami would gladly do whatever she could to protect them. Even when you drive her absolutely bat-shit INSANE wth some of your antics. Drunken singing, dragging her around town like a sack of oranges, or a stray cat. Hauling her into the shower to wash blonde hair dye out of her hair; keeping her up for hours just chatting.
 
Her hand comes out from beneath her shirt silently, the tacts gripped in her hand. This hand moves slowly, coming around so that both arms wrap around Luffy's shoulders tightly. Just for a second - she shouldn't let this drag on. By the sound of something crinkling, she can tell he's heard the clipping hidden there. ""Nothing is wrong I said-"" Nami insists, her voice muffled against red-clad shoulder. Nothing is wrong. Yeah. So why is the thought of knocking her Captain out make her feel so horrid? She curls her fingers around the tacts, ""...ne... aren't you tired yet?"" Please say yes? Just.. fall over asleep okay? ...okay so the likelihood of that happeneing (especially with Nami acting strangely) is minimal. This is why Nami tightens her grip on her tacts, keeping her head turned down so her face can't be seen. o O ( Gomen ne, Luffy. )



What goes around, comes around.  For all the great times they've had, you drive him crazy, leave his head spinning while he tries to wrap his mind around the meanings behind your repertoire of smiles, when you're taking things on your own shoulders and tell everyone 'I'm fine!'; tear-stained maps and goodbye letters, so much scratched-out lines on paper, when you resort to subterfuge and deception because it's something you're good at, something that's carried you through until you met the Straw Hat Pirates.  Back when they numbered only two.

He'd like to understand the whys and whatfors.  But all too often he's caught looking supremely confused, whether she's playing her wiles for a cheaper restaurant bill or putting on a good front when she's come down with a fever they can't cure.  So he's still distracted by the crinkle of paper beneath the cloth tied to the navigator's hair, unaware of the tacts ready in her hand.  

The arm carrying the straw hat is the one that returns her hug; his head is shaking, though his frown is hidden.  ""No.""  How can he be?  He's...

...Worried.  And he doesn't like the feeling something he doesn't understand is in danger of spinning out of control.  ""...Is this like your maps?""  You know the ones he's talking about.




It takes her a while to respond - silence to get her resolve under her belt. A few deep breaths taken. Why is it so /hard/?

...because Luffy's different. He's .. more than just a friend. He's not your average pirate - and that's not because he had eaten a devil fruit. She has no time or attention to try and pull his hand away from where it rests on her head. One wrong move (or right move, depending on your perspective) and it might slip off, and then one of her secrets might be out :O!! Horrors. After all she was doing to keep it protected too.
 
The maps. Yes, she knows which ones he meant. The ones she wanted to throw out because they showed how much she had missed Luffy, in the ink smears and tear stains that told novels of her hours spent crying in the kitchen when no one was around to see it. ""...no."" Nami answers in a small voice. o O ( ....... ) ""Oyasumi, Captain."" She finally manages. And there's one quick movement where in she's taking a step to the side, bringing the tacts down towards the back of her Captain's head. 
 
...why did you have to make this so hard for her?
 
Why couldn't you just have been tired, and gone to bed?
 
 Why..
 
..are you so /nice/? ;.;



Nami's not your average navigator.  There's ... nothing merely average about her.  Someone more shallow might stop at only her ability to draw attention, but she's a remarkable rogue, and her intelligence and resourcefulness has pulled her and others out of countless tight spots.  Her ability to sense the weather?  Uncanny.  But all of that?  Those things are traits he takes pride in, but the fact he treasures more is summed up in one fact:  Nami is nakama.

(( ...no. ))  And Luffy nods slightly, believes her.  That had the note of truth in it, but there's still the question of why for everything else.  Luffy can't find a good way to ask after it.  He doesn't have the chance.

(( Oyasumi, Captain. ))

She moves, and his arm is empty seconds before something hard connects with the back of his head.  ""Na--""

His straw hat hits the deck with a soft paff before he does.  

Nami, when are you going to stop stabbing yourself?



Who can say? Will she ever? She stabbed herself twice thus for. Once to protect Usopp.. once when she was so angry, felt so helpless, .. she couldn't strike at anything but that hateful hateful mark. She visibly winces when Luffy hits the ground - she isn't sure how long he's going to be out, so she'll have to move quickly. She slides the tacts back into her shirt, dropping to her knees, one hand against her head. SHe could leave the clipping here. If anyone could understand, maybe you could.
 
Maybe.
 
She picks up the hat, gently rests it on Luffy's stomach, and rests his hand on top of it. A passing wind causes her hair to blow across her eyes briefly, ""...gomen ne Luffy."" She lifts her hand, reaching towards her kerchief. She can either show him, and find out what happens afterward - or not show him, and then he or someone finds out on their own; or if they're told. ""...what do I do..?"" 
 
Yeah Nami. As if the weather will give you an answer. No. No. She already /knew/ what she was going to do. And that's the problem, wasn't it? She rests her head against a hand, sighing heavily. There was no time for doubts and recriminations now. She sealed her fate when she knocked Luffy out; she can't just change her mind now. She has to see it through. 
 
It'll be worth it right? Everyone will be safe; they'll have a piece of a flying device, and Nami will have whatever money she can steal from her old crew! But the clipping.."

((SHIT.  I'm missing the first round of poses!))


Speaking of blonde friends. Lina's off doing, um, whatever it is Lina does, and she made it Very Clear that she didn't want Gourry with her. So, feeling rather rejected, Gourry has wandered around aimlessly for a little while before deciding to drown his sorrows in food. Heck, just the thought of it is lifting his spirits already. He's whistling cheerfully as he pushes open the door and lets it swing shut behind him. And that's a very familiar straw hat he notices at the bar. He grins in that general direction. ""Hey! Uhh..."" What was that guy's name again? ""...Monkey, right?""



         Ranma grins a little, shrugging. Well, it's something new, and he's heard the phrase 'bar brawl' before and wants to experiment. He raises his glass, clinking it against Luffy's. ""KANPAI!"" With that, he begins chugging the beer down as though he'd been doing it for ages. He pauses partway through and stares at it appraisingly, swishing around a mouthful before swallowing. ""Huh. Kinda bitter, but not too bad, y'know?""



Clink!  The captain will kanpai as often as everyone else on the ship, though, admittedly he can't keep up with Nami and Zoro (the two of them are -scary- when they decide to have a drinking contest, especially if money's on the line!).  But even he has to pause before drinking to widen his eyes at Ranma.  ""Hehe.  Just jump in, huh?"" chortles the captain, before taking a drink.

""Luffy,"" answers the perpetually-disheveled pirate in the straw hat, mumbling into his mug.  He tilts it back for a swallow of its contents and puts it down, wiping his mouth with the back of one hand, thrusting out the other to shake with a partially hidden grin.  ""Monkey D. Luffy. I'm gonna be king of the pirates.  I remember you, you're the funny swordsman guy.""  After all, they had a really good time at the parade together!  That... spontaneous one they threw just for the hellovit.  He waves a hand at the stool next to his, ""Join us--oi ossan!  Okawari!""  Seconds already?  Well, they have another, see.



This probably isn't the last time these two are going to have to introduce themselves to one another, considering the awesome power of their combined total of maybe three and a half braincells. ""Right! Luffy. I knew that."" Gourry grins back and shakes Luffy's hand enthusiastically before claiming the stool next to him. ""I'm Gourry. Gourry Gabriev."" He leans over to peer past Luffy at Ranma, and gives him a grin and a wave too. ""Hi!""


Wow. This 'beer' stuff is pretty cool. Refreshing as all hell, anyway, despite (because of?) the taste. Ranma looks up from the bottom of his first mug and gives Gourry a friendly if appraising look. ""Hey. Nice ta meetcha. Saotome Ranma."" He offers a hand for the shaking, then looks at the beers. ""So, y'wanna join us? Luffy here was showin' me beer. Never had one before today. Well, there /was/ the sake that one time, but it wasn't like I was willin', right?"" ...don't ask. Seriously.


Careful, too many and you'll wake up feeling like your head was scooped empty and everything replaced with fluffy cotton balls.  Have WAY too many, and you'll probably be praying to the porcelain god for the latter part of the night.  For a guy who literally guzzled down the entire contents of a wooden keg full of water and could probably do the same with a keg of beer, he's taking it fairly easy with his own mug; by the time Ranma's finished his another is set before all three of them, and Luffy's only halfway through his first mug.  ""Thanks, ossan!""

He turns his attention to Ranma first, grinning, ""Then to firsts!""  Clinking his half-full mug against Ranma's fresh one, he moves to tap to Gourry's, more in greeting than a proper kanpai, chuckling.  ""Gourry.  What are you doing in Golden Hall, anyway?  You here with family or friends or something?  You're always wandering around alone.""



Gourry wraps his fingers around the handle of his mug and lifts it to meet Luffy's toast. He's more hungry than he is thirsty, but hey--a full belly is a full belly, right? In the end, does it really matter what it's full -of-? (...Yes. Yes it does. But don't tell Gourry that.) ""Um...y'know, I'm not totally sure myself,"" he answers, rubbing at the back of his neck with his free hand. ""But I'm not alone anymore! I found Lina again!"" And there goes that 100-watt grin again. He's clearly very pleased with himself.



Ranma looks up, and the astute would notice that he's already feeling the effects of the brew. Damn, but that boy's got a terrible tolerance. Then again, he's a young asian martial artist with a voracious metabolism. That only makes sense. ""Lina? Wait, you know Lina? Inverse? The shorty with tha cool cape?"" He blinks, then grins. ""Hey, yeah, I know her! She said she was gonna help me with my curse! Need ta find her again, so we can work on that."" He looks back at his mug: still got beer in it. Well, there's a solution to that! ""KANPAI!"" Glug.


From experience, Luffy has an instinctual knowledge that knocking back a few of these in rapid succession would get him reeling, and when that happens, he tends to do stupid things that have his navigator throwing shoes at him.  And as much fun as it is to see Nami get flustered over something, she's seemed -particularly- out of sorts and ... he just isn't eager to aggravate things.  In -fact-, he'd -really- just like to find the source of the problem and kick it's ass into the next century.  

Considering time's stopped? (Kinda.)  That's pretty damn far, he'd say!  ""Kanpai!"" cheers Luffy, who drains at last the rest of his first mug and slaps a palm onto the bar top as he puts down his empty mug in favor of pulling close the next.  ""Ossan, we're hungry, got any meat today?""  While he works out edibles with the bartender, the two of them can discuss Lina, and curses, or the removal of them.  ""You found someone you know, then,"" he finally adds, picking up his mug, ""But it sounds like there's more to it.  C'mon, tell us!""



Oh yeah--there's beer in Gourry's mug too. He sets about remedying that, emptying about a third of the mug in a single enthusiastic swallow. And he's even of legal age! ...Physically, at least. ""Yeah, that's right--Lina Inverse! Heh heh...good to see her reputation's still intact. You know she used to kill bandits for a living, right?"" Of course, who doesn't know that? ""Wait--what curse?"" 

Another gulp of beer, and then he nods happily to Luffy. ""Yep. Lina and I go back a long way."" A long way, that is, for someone with the attention span of a goldfish. ""See, I said I'd protect her, and I have been, only it's kind of hard to protect someone if you don't know where they are, so I was getting pretty worried because I couldn't find her, but then I -did- find her, only..."" His face falls a bit. ""...only she doesn't remember who I am.""



Ranma takes another swig. He's pacing himself a bit now, trying to enjoy the flavor of the beer. Wow, there's a lot to it, really. ""Hey, Luff, Luffy, this is really cool. Thanks f'r takin' me, y'know?"" Gourry brings up the curse, and Ranma looks around a bit. He leans in and breaks into a (loud) stage whisper. ""Well, it's kinda complicated, an' I don't like too many people knowin' about it,"" *coughcoughbullshitheusesitforfreefoodbullshitcoughcough*, ""but when I get wet I turn inta a girl. 'sa real pain in tha ass, an' Lina said that maybe she could take a look at it, y'know? An' sorry ta hear that she didn't know who you were. I had that happened to me, once. Stupid tomboy, after allIdidfor'er, couldn't remember my name. Remembered everythin' else jus' fine, but not me."" Okay, that was the fault of Shampoo (and a brand of shampoo, too), but it's still annoying.




         So, there we have three guys, two of them likely too young to be drinking legally-- where she's from, anyway.

         And so, as it almost always goes in those cliche-ridden entrances, a hand pushes the door open at whatever hour this really is-- accursed fullbright light in the sky-- and holds it briefly with a foot, closing the more often used for rain variety of umbrella. Closed, bound, and tucked under her arm: Guess who, Luffy.

         It smelled in here. And not the good or even a neutral sort, it just ... smelled. Maybe someone can just pin it up on the drunks, but Vance isn't here to contemplate things like that. No, no, she's here to do what any other nineteen year-old would do!

         Drink. Silly. But just a little! Becoming a lush would be so ... unbecoming.

         And as she makes way for the bar, she begins staring at the backs of heads sitting along the length-- why pay for a drink when you can con some schmoe into buying you one? And wait-- isn't that...? ""Accordian Boy?"" Luffy, of course.




Ha ha.  Gourry, join Luffy in the group of people who act more their shoe size than their real age.  Unless it's a serious situation, usually one involving a brand of their own logic proving them more than they seem--wait, what's he talking about?  Gourry's dumb as rocks!  Luffy--well, every time it becomes debateable whether he's just faking it or not, he does something infuriatingly stupid to inconvenience everyone and they take it back.

No wonder he laughs all the time.

The great thing about this place?  They seem to make soft beef jerky relatively often; not quite fully dried yet, but it keeps well, it's salty enough to encourage patrons to drink more (which is ultimately the purpose of bar food) and they have one repeat customer for it who -always- finishes what's on his plate: Luffy.  And when he can't pay the tab, he works in the back with everyone else, and is often amusing enough that the owner doesn't mind if he drops a plate now and then.

A platter of slices of this same jerky is put on the bar, and two slices disappear into Luffy's mouth almost before it's set.  ""Insomnia?""  Amnesia, Luffy.  ""That sucks.  I had that once.  A sea horse ate our memories.""

A -what-?

Ranma is gazed upon in completely undisguised amusement.  He adds, ""Cold water.""  Must specify.  He waves a hunk of meat in one hand to illustrate, his other hand on his stool seat as he idly spins in it, kicking a sandaled foot against the bar base. ""Hot water changes him back.  Clothes change and everyth--Umbrella-lady!"" he exclaims in surprise, squeaking to a stop.  ""HEY!  You gonna join us?  Guys, she's totally cool, she carries an umbrella all day long!""



Gourry blinks curiously at Ranma. ""...Really?"" And then comes a long period of speculative silence on his part, during which he looks back and forth between Ranma and his mug, which still contains about three inches' worth of beer. You can almost hear the hamster-wheel squeaking in his head. He's so absorbed in his train of thought--if any metaphor as powerful as a train could even be used to describe his thought process--that he probably doesn't even hear any of the rest of the conversation. And finally, in a calm, very deliberate motion, he reaches one long arm around Luffy and dumps the contents of his beer mug on Ranma's head.


         Sploosh.
         You know, it's really interesting to see the transformation happen, especially since you /don't/. There's this moment where everybody within eyesight feels a sudden and simultaneous need to look away briefly, distracted by whatever's handy. And then where Ranma was sitting is a much shorter red-headed girl, wearing a billowy and rather low-cut white peasant blouse and a black knee-length skirt. Semi-piratical look. ""Hey! Whatwas that for? Jus' cause I told ya about tha curse din't mean ya hadta go an' experim, experime, try it out're anythin'! Sheesh."" Annoyed, she downs the rest of her mug and starts work on another one. And with less body mass, too.



         And so she leans forward a bit, ankles crossed and free hand throwing a light, casual wave. Such a silly boy and comrades. Though her brows lift and that cheer looks momentarily nullified. ""Ah, your friend isn't around? Such a pity-- she had quite the fetching outfit."" Oh well! No loss, really, the rubber lad was more than amusing himself.

         So Vance advances, also indicating the umbrella that which made her a legend with the Straw Hat pirate, right up until-- *splash*. She steps back accordingly; her gaze taken away from the soaked young man to make sure none of that gets herself wet, and ... then, she looks up. And blinks, confused. Wasn't ... there just ... And, when did? The swordswoman's brow furrows up a little bit, curious enough to stare. Finally, she advances to the stools, sliding off the black coat worn off the shoulders and half-folding, half-piling it onto the bar itself, propping the umbrella beneath. She sits at the first free seat closest to Luffy, of course, legs crossing swiftly and hands at rest on her lap. ""Oh, Accordian Boy, would you mind buying me a drink? Pretty please?""


""Nico Robin?"" answers Luffy with a wide grin, ""She's doing research, she's probably at a bookstore or something.""  Eyes lift ceilingwards while he lightly kicks a foot absent-mindedly, ""Ahh, or maybe reading on the Going Merry.  I'll tell her you said hi!""  Whether you meant such a message to be sent to her or not.  ""What's your name, anyway?""  Because she probably doesn't like being called 'Umbrella-lady'.

...Hey, that's Gourry's arm.  Luffy blinks at it, until the sound of someone getting splashed follows, and he turns his head to look.  Promptly, he bursts into laughter.  ""Yeah, just like that!  Hey, Ranma, you can be Gourry's date, okay?"" he manages between -gigglefits-, fully expecting to get hit when he finally reaches for his mostly-full second mug, and another piece of meat to chew on.  

""Huh?""  A drink?  ""Okay, if it's cheap.""  He doesn't mess around, does he? <_<;  He'll share when he can, but he knows if he doesn't spend too much, he can share with more people that way.  Which is why he's drinking no-frills beer.  Plus, it's COLD.



Being distracted is nothing new to Gourry, so he doesn't think there's anything amiss when his eyes slide away from Ranma for a second. In his case, his eyes happen to fall on Vance, and he gives her a cheery smile and wave as well. And when he looks back...""Hey, you weren't kidding!"" That's pretty cool! And, oh yeah. Um. Uh. -Wow-. Can anyone say total babe? Gourry puts his now-empty beer mug down on the bar again and rests one elbow on it (the bar, not his mug), giving Ranma-chan his best 'cool-guy' grin. ""You know, I think I like you better this way,"" he remarks. ...Probably not the best thing to say when you're trying to make a good impression. And Gourry's not even drunk yet!




         See, right about now Ranma's well into the 'tipsy' stage and working on 'okay, drunk'. And being hit on by morons never puts her in a good mood. Luffy gets an idle backhand with an empty mug, ""Thanks f'r tha support, Senchou. Next time, keep yer trap shut, y'know? Yeesh. Got enough problems, right?""
         Gourry, on the other hand, gets a bleary-eyed and somewhat hostile look. ""Look. Don' try. Better men than you have tried. Crazier, stupider men have tried, an' that sounds like somethin' hard ta do, but they have. Guy named Kunou. Wouldn't take a fuggin' hint, y'know? I mean, I CHANGED in front of the asshole an' he wouldn't get it!"" She waves her half-full glass in the air vaguely, ""I mean, what the hell is wrong with tha world when I guy like me, a man amongsht men'n all that stuff, best damned martial artshtsh you'll ever meet, has ta put up with some stupid sword-wavin'... stupid... person hittin' on him? AM I RIGHT?""




         Such ... interesting company that the Accordian Boy keeps. A ... strange girl that looks like quite the lush at this point, a blonde man that dares waste good beer, and ... ...

         How the hell did she get to know these people?

         And so Vance pouts a little at Luffy, shoulders sagging. ""Oh, fine. I'll drink the cheap stuff."" But hey-- free. And her hand comes to her chin, fingertips at rest on her lip. ""Truly? Excellent. But to be stuck -researching- on such a day like this... it seems like such a bore. Not that the day is ... ever anything different, lately."" Her finger lifts as she nods. ""But the point stands!"" And then her hand is offered toward Luffy, a small smile tugging the corners of her mouth. ""'Vance' will suffice, dear. And you are?""




Watch as this totally obvious pass at the pretty red-head sitting next to him goes literally right over Luffy's head.  Or through one ear and out the other, either way it seems like it's just passing through thin air without so much as a blink or comment.  It'd be polite to offer some of the jerky, but... as anyone on the Going Merry could attest, Luffy really only offers to share food (especially meat) with really close nakama, and typically only if he thinks it'll cheer them up.  And even then, sometimes he'll still say 'but just one piece!'  He's a carnivore, what can he say?

""Vance, okay!""  The bartender and he exchange a few words and soon, passed to Vance is another frosty mug of ... well, it's what they're having, which is just cheap beer, really.  ""Luffy.  Monkey D. Luffy,"" he says, fingers grasping the front part of the brim of his straw hat, smiling.  ""I'm the man who'll become King of the Pirates, but for now, I'm captain of the Mugiwara Kaizoku-dan--uh, the Straw Hat Pirates.""

He doesn't look like a pirate.  Nor does he look like someone who will become king of anything, except maybe king of fools.  His own mug rests on a palm on his lap, ""As for Robin, she loves researching things.  She's gonna find out the True History.  What are you here for?""  Because everyone, it seems, has a reason for hanging around.



Gourry casually reaches over and snags a few pieces of jerky from the plate in front of Luffy before it all gets eaten. That's the thing that's stuck in his mind the most about Luffy: he's just as much competition for food as Lina is, if not more so. ""Hi Vance!"" he says, with one piece of jerky sticking out of the corner of his mouth. ""Gourry Gabriev."" The more the merrier, right? Right!

Then he blinks in bewilderment at Ranma and scratches thoughtfully at his cheek with one finger. ""Umm...I dunno if you've noticed, but I don't think you count as a man anymore,"" he points out helpfully. And yeah, he's not any happier about wasting beer than Vance is, but he just HAD to see it for himself. And besides, there's more on the way. He claims his fresh mug and takes a long drink.



         Hey, food! ""Gimme somathat!"" Ranma grabs at the plate, successfully snagging a few pieces of jerky and popping them into her mouth. Munchmunchmunch, swallow. ""Ahh. Good stuff, Luff. Luffy. Luffers. Cap'n Loofa. Hehehehe."" She sways slightly, peering at her beer curiously before downing the last of it. ""Ahhh, that's the stuff. So who's up for a fight?"" She says it casually, as though she were asking about the weather or questioning Gourry's intelligence.




         ""Aww, how cute. I hope you do really well with that!"" Doubt that he's a pirate? Hell yes. But it's still nice to see young kids with goals, these days. Unlike the blonde man introducing himself now with the food hanging from his gaping maw, so rude to talk with his mouth full. ""Charmed."" she responds, one hand sliding up to her knee while the other scoops up her drink for the initial sip. And no chugging or slamming it down, either, Vance gets a good taste of it in her mouth, and ... yuck. Wow. Is it too late to get her money back?

         She didn't pay for it? A -detail-.

         ""Hn. Fighting is so bothersome-- the cuts, the bruises, the occasional scream of the innocent bystander too stupid to not move. But -research-? Tell me more, darling.""



""Um.""  Innocent bystander too stupid to not move?  Luffy's single track of thought kind of hits a rut in the road but keeps meandering along, that brief hitch soon forgotten.  Ahh, to be (purposefully, sometimes) blissfully unaware.  ""Fighting's fun sometimes.""  Sparring with Zoro!  That's always fun!  Except getting beaned with a wooden sword isn't.  ""As for her research, I don't know anything else.  She's looking for Poneglyphs because she can read them.""  One hand's occupied with a mug of slowly diminishing beer, so the other sweeps out wide.

""They were all over the Grand Line, so maybe we'll find some here.  HUUUUGE blocks with strange writing on them.  She can read it and everything.""  Talking, being thirsty work, is interrupted by a swallow of his drink, and he continues, but this time, to peek over at his two companions.  ""He's right.  You're a girl now, suck it up.""  Innocent turn away.  Did he say anything?  Newp.  ""...Fight?  Can you fight in your condition?"" asks Luffy light-heartedly, shoulders shaking in laughter.  No offense or anything, he's just cracking a joke.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Winterheart's Finest Come To Golden Hall For The Criminal Alchemist?"">
You know, it's a shitty day. He's been feeling pretty good -- really -- for the past month. He worked a lot out last March, about so many things. He took care of his family, instead of running off to save the world. And sure, sometimes trouble came to him, but he got through it. Hell, he begins to wonder now, if the Gods aren't /rewarding/ him -- Winry's arrival shortly after that ordeal with Harth, where things were finally /decided/ between them, and they both walked away to their respective corners without looking back... well. He has to wonder, sometimes. 

But Edward Elric -- the blond, short one, over there, who has just walked out of the sunny light of the hall into the twilight gray between the lands of the hall and the lands of Middleton, a small bag over one shoulder, realizes that, you know, sometimes joy and peace are short lived.

No pun intended, natch.

With a friend by his side, though -- it's a little easier to bear up under, though. He'd rather it be Al, but Al would fight like like-- well, like a /bear/-- in defense of his brother, even if Ed got it in his noggin to surrender peacefully to the forces he knows are heading up from the South. So, it is to his companion that he says, in a small voice, ""You know -- I don't agree with why she wants me, and I can't say I want to go -- but you do realize, if they play it peaceful like, I'm gonna just say 'put me in cuffs and take me'?""

You can hit him now, Luffy, for the sheer amount of STUPID that just came out of Edward's mouth. He knows you will. Hell, he's prepared, for he has subtly braced. He's ready. You can punch him in the face now.




Luffy would fight like a monkey, but only because he's got this tendency to climb up on people, stationary objects, not-so-stationary objects, and hit people with them.  Except Al would have caught on to the purpose of this walk well before now, whereas Luffy is only here because he wandered this way, prodded in a direction by a surreal trail of broken doll parts that looked a little like a certain Alchemist, if the blonde hair and gray-painted arm and leg pieces were any clue.

They were gone when he finally encountered Edward on the road, and only smiled when he said he was out for a walk.

The Straw Hat Captain kept his silence even up until the Fullmetal Alchemist began speaking, and beneath the shade cast by the brim of his hat, dim in the gray light, he casts Edward a sideways glance.  ""Giving yourself up, just like that?"" he replies blandly, eyes lidding.

A palm swipes out to the back of his head for a sharp, if not particularly painful smack.

""Baka ja nee no ka? -- Are you stupid?  ...Why?  What're you gonna gain by doing something reckless like that?""



Good news for Edward: Yurimaru actually came close to alone for this trip. He's not the sort to go on a mad raid for one person. Not unless there's an obvious need for it. So rather than coming to Golden Hall with an army to drag Edward out kicking and screaming (as much fun as that would have been), he's here with just himself and a handful of backup to check things out. Of course, that's the bad news: the backup is presently some of Winterheart's finest. With Harth gone, Yurimaru doesn't feel bad about drawing some of the more skilled vampires out of the Middleton garrison to come along with him. Besides, this was instructions directly from the Justice itself. Harth would understand the need for some of his more powerful warriors. Especially when it involves actually going into Golden Hall (where Yurimaru's got solid evidence that Edward still is).
         For now, he's just walking along the roadway between Middleton and Golden Hall, deciding for himself how best to go about getting in once he reaches the gates. However, he's pulled up short when one of the vampires warns of the approaching pair. Not _any_ approaching pair, either. One of them is Edward. ""How nice of him to make it easy to find him."" Yurimaru murmurs to the vampire. ""Gather the others. Draw back for the moment. Watch for more backup. If he's foolish enough to be out on his own, I'll handle him by myself."" And yes, that's a sinister light in Yurimaru's eye as he says that. He's more than ready to take Edward along, whether it be quietly or loudly. ... preferably loudly, to be honest. Damn them for asking for him alive and sane. Ol' Yuma's got a chip on his shoulder.



HURK! That's Edward's head, shooting forward as he staggers and flails his arms. ""The -- ow! That /hurt/!"" And he reaches up, straightens his hair, and then says, ""Preceisely because it's reckless. Because--""

Because it's equivalent trade. He took their leader--or so they'd like to say, even if he knows it probably has /little/ to do with him, and all to do with Harth's strength of weakness--and they want to make him hurt. ""Someone they needed, wanted, respected, whatever -- is gone. They think it's my fault. Honestly? It's not. I know what happened... and they don't. But that won't matter to them. He was -- someone imporant to them."" He figures that'll explain it in terms Luffy understands. ""Even bad people... have nakama, Luffy. The people with nakama-- they make the worst who turn... because their revenge is the worst.""

He ought to know. That's one of his prime, definiing characteristics. Just how /far/ he's willing to go for his family... nearly becoming a murderer himself. 

He glances over quietly, and then says, ""Are you going to stop me? They'll take me one way or another... Sooner or later. I'd rather not fight here, win, and have them hurt my family... But if you wanna make a show of resistance..."" he glances down the road-- ah, look. ""There they are.""

And he salutes. He /salutes/ the bastard. He's got balls of pure titantium, to /salute the welcoming commitee from Winterheart/. Or brains of rocks. And we'd thought that was /Luffy/.



It was an excellent idea to bring some of Winterheart's finest, because it'll take every last one to keep someone like Luffy down.  And it's not to toot his own horn or anything, but seriously; this is a guy with the highest bounty on his head in West Blue, someone for whom the Buster Call by the government was almost made, a situation in which some of the Marines' finest in several warships show up to blast you into oblivion.

The worst kind of inescapable fate.

Luffy could be anyone; some farm boy with a straw hat and woven hemp sandals, a pair of denim shorts cut off at the knees and a red vest.  It's even debateable if he could be recognized from Middleton, considering he was just one (albeit very oddly dressed, in that tribal costume) among many fighting in the streets.  The pirates seem to have gathered for themselves a nifty ability in the Dream to blend in easily in a crowd, or something.

He grabs at the back of Edward's coat to keep him from falling forward, at least until he straightens up on his own, frowning.  ""Lemme get this straight.  You know the truth, and you're letting them take you anyway?  Without a fight?  They're -not- here for your family, they're only interested in you.  They could care LESS about the people you live with.""  Perhaps even enough to hurt them and not feel bad in the least.  He takes this for granted; pirates do that stuff all the time these days.

Luffy's silent for a while, glancing out of the corner of his eye towards the aforementioned welcoming commitee.  ""..... Idiot,"" he manages at last, facepalming.  ""I won't let them.  Your family will just hurt more knowing you gave yourself up for them.""  Letting the Sea King bite off your arm?  This is one sacrifice he isn't just standing by to watch happen.  ""I'm gonna fight.  Get in my way, and I'll kick your ass.""




Even if Yurimaru's too far away to hear what they're saying just yet, it's obvious from the body language just what's going on. Edward's wave is answered with a slow nod, the demon's impassive face creasing ever so slightly with lines of contempt. He doesn't like the young man. He doesn't like him one bit. As far as he's concerned, Edward's the reason for Harth's disappearance. And he'd like nothing more than to tear the blond brat apart here and now. ""Follow at a distance. Be prepared."" he murmurs to the vampires behind him as he steps forward from them, hands slipping into his sleeves, eyes never leaving Edward. Not even for Luffy. As far as he's concerned, the one he's here for is the only one worth bothering with just now. In other words, poor Yuma's not yet got an inkling of who Luffy is.
         ""Edward."" he says, voice a little louder, but still surprisingly mellow considering the situation. ""You may well realize this already, but you are wanted by Winterheart. Leave your friend and come along with us, and there will be no harm done on either side. If you fight, we will do what we must to bring you back. And we do not have to do it alive; the gods trust that you will return."" A complete and utter lie, yes, but one that might serve him well in keeping Edward reasonably docile. Or so he hopes. ... besides, if worse comes to worse, he can always apologize for the state of the body. They _didn't_ say they wanted him unhurt. Just alive.




A sigh heaved. ""Luffy -- I just got Winry back. It'll hurt to lose me for a few weeks, maybe -- but in the end, I'll come home... but... I lost her once already. I don't-- want them to hurt her, have their hands on her, ever again."" He looks forward. ""I love her, and the others, too much, to let animals like this head for them. And they /will/, eventually. That's the weakness of people like us -- nakama... means more people that can be hurt, just like it means more people that can give you love, Luffy.""

And he won't see any one of these animals touch his girl, his brother, his /family/. His fingers curl. God, he wants to just lay them all low... but at this point, it's better to just play along, in Edward's mind. ""At least -- let them make the first move, eh? We'll see what happens from there.""

It's about the only concession Edward can give. 

But he smirks slightly at Yurimaru's pronouncement. ""Oh, I realize it. And I thought -- I was wanted by Middleton, sir? Or -- are you going to be the new Govoner of the new... principality, I hear, they're setting up there?"" he asks, conversationaly. Oh, hell, he doesn't want to give himself up to /this/. He's a whiny little peacock! ""Maybe I /will/ fight. Something tells me he's... here for a personal reason."" Yeah. He sighs, and then unwrapps what he brought in his small bag -- the heavy head of a spear, with a dragon laying across it's blade. ""Well,"" he says simply. ""I can see you're already looking for payback."" He claps his hands, and extends them over the earth, spear head in hand, He glances to Luffy, as wood -- for greenery and roots are /everywhere/ here-- extends up, becoming the springy haft of his spear, tipping the end with a staked tip. ""Don't fight to save my life. If it looks like I'm going to fall, let them have their way."" And then he's got that spear up, over his shuolder, behind his neck, fingers curled easily around it's haft.

""I can tell,"" he says, just loud enough for Yurimaru, ""Why he came to me for what you cuoldn't give him.""

And that, my friends, is /fightin' words/ to a Peacock chosen.




Yuma might be in for a bit of a surprise, in that case.  He wouldn't be alone in it - nearly everyone Luffy's ever met since the day he ate the Devil Fruit that Shanks' crew had come upon... has underestimated an otherwise extremely simpleminded and odd youth from nowhere in particular.  Hundreds have laughed to hear he was a captain with aspirations to becoming King of the Pirates.  And a lot of them were singing a different tune by the time the Straw Hat Pirates were headed off to another adventure, leaving a trail of lives forever changed, friends and foes alike.

Luffy isn't helping his case much, by remaining silent and studiously cracking his knuckles, shaking the joints loose and flexing his fingers while looking in another direction, as if distracted by something other than a contingent of vampires, their leader, and an Alchemist wanted by the side that's currently 'winning' the Game with a stalemate.

His eyes widen again at the display of Alchemy.  Normally, an exclamation of how nifty that is would've followed, but he's distracted by Edward's next.  ""Don't tell me what I can and can't fight for.  Do it again and I'll hit you.""  It's just his way.

Luffy kind of 'twitches' a glance up at the verbal -burn- Edward delivers to Yuma, and then slowly looks Edward's way, fingers caught in the act of inspecting a hangnail.  ""...You guys aren't gonna...""

Um.  ""...Turn this into a catfight, are you?""  Wide-eyed stare.  That -to'lly- sounded like something two girls say to each other before they start pulling hair and scratching each others' eyes out.  He saw it happen at a bar once, seriously!  Girls are SCARY when they catfight!

Turning his attention to Yuma, he puts a hand to one knee and... starts stretching, leaning to one side with an arm over his head, then switching to the other direction.  Staring blankly the whole time.



The burn causes Yurimaru to narrow his eyes slightly and frown at him, but that's about all that can be said. The demon has powers of self control that many would envy, and he's cultivated them for most of his life. Still, the fact that Edward managed to get a _frown_ out of him is really saying something. Oh. So _that's_ how you want it, is it? Then the Justice will just have to forgive when Edward comes in less-than-perfect. He just completely removed any chance of having Yurimaru act gentlemanly about this whole thing.
         One hand comes up to gesture at the vampires, casually waving them forward enough that they can start surrounding the two. No good having them run off, and it keeps any outside help from sneaking in while they're distracted. The vampires are more than happy to do that, of course. It's a chance for them to get involved with this whole thing, rather than just having to follow the orders of a poncy demon!
         ""Your words are as empty as your head, Edward."" he murmurs silkily. ""What you had with the Chosen Of Roc was nothing but empty mistakes and stupid obsession. I don't know what you have done with him this time, but we will eventually find him, and if Middleton hasn't pulled you apart by then, I will be more than happy to do it for them."" Threats made, Yurimaru gives a half-bow, almost playfully polite, toward Edward. ""If you insist on making this a fight, then a fight it will be."" Yurimaru tells Edward, voice mellow, attention completely on him and not on the stretching Luffy. Sorry, Straw Hat, but Edward just raised his ire. ""I'll bring you back either way. In pieces, if I must. And I'll enjoy every single moment of it."" And as he speaks, the silvery edge of a thread snakes its way from his sleeve, almost invisible in the darkness of the fields, extending slowly as Yurimaru scans for a chance to lash out with it. A stalemate, for the moment, perhaps; other than the vampires and their circling, neither side is doing much attacking. Just mouthing off.



Just for that, Luffy gets the first slap, upside the head. -.-; Goddamn it, Luffy! Shut up! ""I do /not/ catfight. Merely playing on Peacock boy's level. I think he thinks I slept with his vampire... At least, I think that's what he's thinking. And I think Harth wouldn't give pansy-ass here the time of day, cause ... uh, Harth's taste? Better man than I, if you can explain that."" He shrugs, and then considers this, and... ""So, yeah, I guess this makes it catfighting. Goddamn it! I like /girls./ I have a nice one, waiting at home for me to get through with shit like this! A really nice one!"" Don't you get it, Luffy?! REALLY NICE ONE!

And she's scary with wrenches. Catfight? You've never seen Winry Rockbell fight. No hairpulling, no way! She beats you to death with /power tools/.

""He faded,"" he calls out, casually. ""He's not /here/. Every priest -- which, oh, you're /not/, no? Should have gotten a clue-up by now. His temple's probably defiled by now -- waiting for someone else to claim a new seat of power for the cold bird..."" But he shrugs quietly. ""We'll play it your way. If it hadn't been a jealous wannabe boyfriend, I might've gone peacefully. But you? What a /joke/. No wonder he couldn't do anything, with lackies like /you/."" And then that spear has lashed out -- the haft is springy and flexible, so it should come as no surprirse that Edward bounces a little, and that thing goes down with the heavy weight of it's head, and then WHIPS around in his turn as the elasticity of it's haft sends it up hard, adding oomph to the sideways strike toward the circling vampires, looking to clear space. He has to move the hell away from Luffy, though, to really -fight- with his spear. his style takes up a lot of room if he wants it to be truly effective... and, honestly? Ed's got a lack of reach that weapon makes up for.




Yuma's attention on Edward?  That works just fine for him.  Luffy will continue warming up, putting a hand to his opposite shoulder and another at his back and turning one way, switching for turning the other way, just turning his head to keep an eye on the vampires that are circling them.  In the grey twilight, it's no wonder they have no problems being out and about.  There's no direct light this far from Golden Hall, and Luffy's finally seeing the logic in all that unending brightness.  Smart move.  It's too bad they can't extend it to the rest of the Gameboard.

He's finished his work when Edward smacks him upside the head, though all it gets is a blink in response.  ""Why play on his level?  He doesn't look like the type to play fair, what's the point?""  Ed thinks Yuma thinks Ed slept with Yuma's vampire.  This is Edward getting a slow, blank-faced series of blinks from a distressingly clueless-seeming Luffy.  "".........""  He likes girls.  Another blank stare.

""EW, that's like sleeping with a corpse!  How could anyone sleep well with something that cold and gross?!""

...Not that kind of sleeping.  Luffy is hopeless.

Edward gets ready to do his thing and Luffy?  He walks in the opposite direction, strolling up to one of the nearest circling vampires.  ""'Scuse me.  Wanna get out of the circle.""

One of three things may happen at this point.

If they let him through, the conceding vampire will get a fist between the eyes, unless he evades.

If they don't let him through, the nearest vampire may get seized and swung around at his two neighbors.

If they don't know how to handle the request and just stare, he'll attempt to grab two vampires by the head and smash their skulls together.

If they attack, well, we'll see what happens!  Turn to page 11--*bricked*




Well, the vampires don't directly attack. Not right away, anyhow. They just tighten the circle and snarl fangily at Luffy as he tries to 'break through'. No chance. They're not letting him through so-... there's suddenly a vampire being grabbed and swung toward the others, and the sounds from the fanged ones is anything but pleased. If anything, they're absolutely shocked. After all, who'd expect that a beanpole like Luffy would have the ability to do something like that? He's going to have a spot opened for him to get through, if he moves quick; the vampires are too busy picking themselves up and getting their heads about them to immediately make a return-attack on him.
         For Edward's attack, the reaction is similar: one of surprise and noisy squeals on the parts of suddenly slashed vampires. Two of them move out of the way in time, showing their superior-to-human speed. The third one, superior speed or not, is caught too far off-guard to do anything but stare at the deep gut-wound that it's received. Fortunately for it... and unfortunately for Edward... it takes a lot more than a gut-wound to put a vampire down. After staring stupidly at the blood for a moment, it brings its eyes up to Edward and snarls furiously, breaking the circle to try and lunge in to grab him. It's _on_, now. And unless Yurimaru calls him off, this fellow's not going to stop.
         As for Yurimaru, he just raises his eyebrows slightly in some surprise. And he smirks slightly. He _smirks_. That should be the first sign that not everything is going well for the good guys... or at least that Yurimaru believes it isn't. And still, he doesn't dive in to attack. He'll let the vampires handle themselves for the moment. Him? He's still waiting for that opening to snake in and handle this the quick and easy way. He's keeping one eye on Edward and one on Luffy for that reason. After all, even the strongest don't tend to like electricity.



Oh bother. Edward seems positively bored with this -- honestly, you've staked on vampire, THE vampire, you've staked them all. And ignoring Luffy's -- misunderstanding of 'sleeping with the enemy', Edward just shakes his head and goes abou becoming a nice whirlwind of blady death over in his little corner. That spear whips and bends and slashes like /nothing's/ business, and Edward handles it like an expect. Then again-- he'd been using a spear sinec he was ten years old -- so it is very little wonder that at twenty-two, he has gained an extreme proficiency in it.

Enough that the vampires that come too close may part with with heads, and those who seek a back strike will find that Edward more then adept at reversing his strikes and sending that whittled down, wooden tip toward the vampires behind him, too, seeking to slide between the ribs and reduce them to dust.

Ed's gone to a happy place in combat; one where he is utterly confident and without fear of loss. These will fall. He'll make Yuma's price for his hide dear -- or at least, dear in numbers. Let's see the strongest of the strong take him down -- he'll go down fighting; claws only catch cloth so far, his coat fluttering about his legs as he turns to intoduce one to the business end of his blade.

It's like dancing, but better -- at least, as far as Ed's concerned.



Luffy's not finished with the vampire he'd, with seemingly casual efforts, snatched up to swing around like a bludgeoning device of questionably-alive status.  An arm hooks around the throat of the vampire (no displays of unusual elasticity yet, but his strength is likely on par with even these undead), his other arm pulled back as he drags both himself and his burden out of the circle.  Only to drive his fist repeatedly into the lower back of his captive.  With a living creature, hitting the kidneys would hurt something terrible, but he's not aiming for organs, he's literally trying to crack the vertebrae of his back.

The captain of the Straw Hat Pirates isn't one to take lives without excellent reason, but these vampires are already dead as far as he's concerned.  He's just trying to make this one incapable of moving, his grimace of effort visible where the brim of his straw hat covers the rest of his face as he bows his head near the vampire's shoulder.

""I--"" smack ""EVEN"" crack ""SAID"" crunch ""PLEASE, YOU PIECE OF SHIT.""  The vampire is dumped to the side, a fist brought up with gritted teeth.  ""--NEXT!  Kakatte KOI, kisama!""




And with his back broken, the vampire falls to the ground, writhing briefly in pain before laying still. Dusting doesn't happen, though; a broken back might cripple the thing, but it doesn't kill it. Unfortunately for the vampire, that is. Still, it's as effectively out of the fight as one who'd been killed, considering it can't move a muscle until some of the healing kicks in. Who's next, Luffy asks? The two vampires bludgeoned by their own friend are next. While others are still staring stupidly, they're lunging in to try and grab for him. One's going for an arm, to try and drag Luffy in and tangle him up as best he can. The other one's going for a no-nonsense grab around the waist, aiming to throw Luffy off-balance, and going for the throat with vampiric fangs. Surely with two on one, they can handle one little(?!) farm-boy, right? At least, that's what they're thinking.
         Edward's getting about as much respect as Luffy right now. The vampires have backed off to give him space when one of the bunch ends up with a spear lashed through its chest, practically exploding into a cloud of dust and crumbling around his feet. He, too, is getting ganged up on, as one vampire lunges for the front, trying to tackle him before he can get the spear out and ready, while another goes for the back to wrap an arm around his neck and pin him. So Edward's whirling can handle one at a time. Can it handle two at once?
         And Yurimaru? Still waiting patiently. The fact that he's just seen two vampires get killed (or rather, one killed and one rather effectively dead) doesn't seem to disturb him in the least. He's still waiting until he's got some space. Or at least until he has an opening. Hopefully with the extras making their moves, though, he'll have the chance. And don't think that he won't take it! On either Luffy _or_ Edward. ... or both.



Oh, pfft! Good luck finding an opening in the whirling dervish -- certainly, Edward likes to stay moving, and he makes it damn hard for people to /find/ a way to box him in -- including using the spear to polevault. He's not above acrobatic manuvers if he has to clear space -- in fact, he even /relishies/ it, blond hair flapping about behind -- at least until someone gets behind and manages to get ahold and YANK, hard.

OW. SCALP. PROTESTING. OW. 

Edward snaps backward, but before the man behind him can get a snack in, he uses spear to stab deep -- it may not kill him, but it /hurts/ to have a bit of wood stuck in your guts, and then TWISTed and ripped hard to the side as he moves the blade in a fanning arc, keeping vampires at bay from the fore. Once he's loosened, he pops that back one again, this one higher, trying to make sure he ends up dust this time.

At lesat he's reaonably sure that Luffy can in fact take care of himself. Now if only the world was reasonably sure that Ed could do the /same/.



Dinner and a movie first, bastards!  Luffy isn't aware that vampires can effectively heal even crippling wounds over time with their own power; once he's on the ground and not moving, he's no longer considered a part of the continuing threat that is the contingent of undead Yurimaru has brought with him for the purpose of retrieving Edward.  Luffy equates these people from Winterheart with the events that had been touched upon in conversation with Edward before, and he's under the impression that letting him get dragged off is about as smart as giving his family rusty razors to slit their wrists with.  It'd only cause more pain and mess later to clean up, or so he assumes.

He only knows a small part of the story, and feels a little obligated to at least make an effort to not see it happen again.  Not for Edward, but for all the people whose lives are touched by him, as well.  Karma's a bitch, and while he won't often go out of his way to protect acquaintances, he feels justified for this reason in this case.

One grabs his arm and gets a fist whipping around as he twists as his waist is grabbed by another, to crack a hard blow upside one vampire's head, and then jerk his elbow back to meet and hopefully dislocate the jaw of the vampire attempting to bite for his throat on the way back.  A sandalled foot plants on his stomach to shove him off, his arm hooks back around the vampire's neck behind him and /twists/.  Man, what he wouldn't give for Zoro's swordsmanship, or Usopp's excellent aim, Nami's quick thinking--need he go on?  Fights are so much more -effective- and fun with his nakama around.



Vampires are falling left, right, and center. With the combat skill of both Luffy and Edward, they're having a hard time keeping up, completely unsure of how to handle a blond dervish with a dead-spear and an almost invincible punching bag of rubber. Luffy's vampires get smacked around almost like rag-dolls, trying their best to continue the fight, but having more than a little trouble. There's a sharp *snap* as Luffy's twist brings another vampire to an end, the broken neck not as good as decapitation but more than good enough to take it out of the fight. Edward's spear doesn't heart-stab the other vampire, but again, the damage done is enough to remove it from the fight, falling to the side and doing what it can to hold its innards inside where they belong. This could be a humiliating loss for Winterheart at this rate; two kids against a small swarm of vampires, and _winning_.
         But now Yurimaru actually has the chance that he'd been looking for. ""Incompetents. All of you."" he says quietly toward the dead, dying, and just plain being-humiliated vampires. His hands slip out of his sleeves, the threads now propelled in the direction of both Luffy and Edward, one hand for each one. Luffy's thread wraps firmly around his throat, to try and choke some air off. Edward's throat's a bit better-guarded, so the filmy thread tangles around one wrist where it lays on the pole. And there's a very brief pause where, in Yurimaru's mind, time seems to slow down. Then, he smiles coldly. The night is lit briefly by a sharp glow from the demon, his bones seeming to shine through the robe for a moment while the power gathers. And then, Edward and Luffy both get to be touched with a powerful surge of electricity, hurled through Yurimaru's garrotes and into their bodies. Fortunately for them, it's not enough to be a killing blow. Unfortunately, that means that they'll get a chance to feel what it's like to suck down several thousand volts. Nighty-night. ... well... at least that was the plan. And sometimes, plans don't go according to... uh... plan.



And you know, Ed's got few weaknesses -- but you know? Sucking down voltage is one of them. Especially when he spies that little thread around his arm, the one curled around his spear -- the metal one.

And then he looks up at Yurimaru in lack of comprehensino and the goddamn demon goes up like a /Christmas tree/. 

And cue Ed making a 'ghk' sound, merely a split second before /he/ practically lights up like a Christmas tree, and -- then, unceremoniously drops to the ground like a sack of potatoes.

Smoking.

That's gonna seriously leave a mark.



Some of Winterheart's finest are getting the beatdown of their unlives by a couple of kids.  Edward's taller than he was a few years ago, but being twenty-something, he still looks young, being ...um, short.  Luffy's still a teenager and often doesn't even act his age rather than his shoe size.  Both of them are used to combat with multiple opponents, but then again, both of them, on their respective worlds, were dangerous enough to warrant sending multiple opponents after them.

Luffy fails to notice a thread-like wire wrapping around his throat until he feels it tighten, and pauses to try to grab at it in vain as he wheezes, eyes wide.  It's too small and thin to get a hold of, so his efforts are in vain, and that's when he feels an odd, tingling race through his body.  Thanks to fighting a 'Lightning God', Eneru, he's familiar with this sensation by now.

That's--

That's electricity.  Luffy would have surprised his own crew by crying out and dropping to the ground, but there's a method to this madness; falling down and appearing to be rendered unconscious by the electricity that, being rubber, has as much potency as hitting him with a feather, might have that thread loosening its grip around his throat so he can breathe a little more.  Hitting the ground also gives him a chance to catch his breath, so he drops and -stays- there, straw hat seated at an awkward angle on his head.

Him?  He's just waiting for Yurimaru to go let down his guard and start sauntering over to gloat over a fallen Alchemist.



The vampires get waved off by Yurimaru once his prey goes down. ""Watch for reinforcements. Maybe you'll be more useful at _that_. And pick up the trash they left behind."" he says with more than a little disgust. Oh no doubt the vampires are pissed at him, but Yurimaru has the pull at the moment. Enough pull to growl at him and to go about their business of picking up their crippled and mangled friends, while a couple others scout the area to make sure no one's silly enough to make a move on this little drama.
         Meanwhile, while that's going on, Yurimaru casually looses the threads' power. They stay tangled, in case he should need to give another jolt, but they're not throwing a charge any more. As far as he's concerned, he doesn't need it. And just as Luffy had anticipated, he does go over to Edward, to stand over the blond for a moment and shake his head at him. ""That was easier than I expected. Too easy. You're pitiful."" And he then bends to pick him up in a surprisingly gentle manner. Not because he _likes_ Edward or anything. Oh no. It's just easier to carry someone when their weight is distributed, rather than ragdolled. Besides, the Justice asked that he be brought back alive. Grumble grumble grumble. Maybe if he asks nicely, he can have the leavings...



Aww, isn't that nice. Gentle. Edward is a heap in Yurimaru's arms, limp and loose. Just gonna lay there, see, all nappy like. Innit he cute when he's not making vampires explode?



The fallen pirate's hand twitches on the ground as the vampires scatter to go about their assigned business, picking up their beaten comrades and scouting for reinforcements.  Once Yurimaru's headed over to pick up Edward, Luffy takes one soft, deep breath and pushes himself up to his feet quietly, only momentarily dizzied by oxygen once more flowing freely.

""Muda darou.""  (It's pointless.) Behind Yurimaru, there's the soft pat of a sandal touching the ground.

""Gomu dakara.""  (It's rubber.)  And a hand grasps at the back of his robes, as a straw-hatted pirate, his eyes hidden in the shadow of his hat, pulls back his other fist with intent to bring it down hard.  If Yurimaru has a trump card, now's the time to use it.



Yurimaru doesn't have a trump card, per se. He's got a rather briefly shocked expression as the pirate suddenly grabs him by the back of his robes, and he can feel the fist drawing back. About all he can do is focus hard on tightening the thread, knowing damned well that it's not going to put Luffy out in time to avoid a punch...
         But all is not lost for the devil. Perhaps most of the vampires are willing to let him get his, and leave it at that. Fortunately for Yurimaru, there is one with enough loyalty left, even after the chewing out, that he can lunge in and grab for Luffy's arm with a snarl. Perhaps he can't do much, but at least he can slow the rubber man down enough to let Yurimaru's stranglehold take effect.



Luffy can feel that wire tightening around his throat, but he's -assured- it won't save him from at least eating one of his punches.  What he didn't plan on was his arm getting caught by a vampire behind him, and suddenly having to contend with a weight pulling his arm back while he's trying to throw it forward.  The result is a losing battle that eventually has him letting go of Yurimaru's robes to try to grapple with the vampire.

Fighting these guys wasn't so tough when he could breathe, but in another minute of furious grappling, it's clearly over when Luffy drops to a knee, wavers a moment, and then falls flat on his face.  This sucks.  At least he gave it his best shot.

</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""A Put-Upon Navigator!  Winry's Distress and Luffy's Bad News!"">

Waking up was like trying to punch one's way out of several layered wet paper bags, but Luffy managed it after a few tries.  He did a quick mental tally of the situation.  Hat.  Check.  Still dark out, so too much time didn't pass (though in hindsight, remembering that now it was pretty much always dark meant one couldn't rely on the sun for the time of day).  His neck hurt something fierce, and when he swallowed, he could taste copper at the back of his throat.  Otherwise, he was fine.  All ten fingers and toes present and accounted for.

No Edward.  ""Shit,"" was Luffy's succinct verdict of the situation, when he dusted off his hat and, set off, a rather disheveled and dusty pirate with a red garotte-welt that would probably turn into a bruise shortly.  

The day kind of sucked, so far.  And under whatever circumstances that caused his and Nami's paths to cross, whatever her questions were, at first he'd only put an arm around her waist and .....rather literally flung her onto a shoulder and marched off for the farmhouse.  He'd explain, but he needs that time to get his throat to stop hurting when he attempts to talk.

Needless to say, Nami probably doesn't appreciate this method of travel one bit.



So yeah. The quiet of the day? Gone. Just gone. Along with whatever concern and patience Nami had originally had when she ran into Luffy. In fact, she's probably heard before she's seen. 
 
""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! DAMNIT PUT ME DOWN! LUFFY I SWEAR TO GOD I'M GOING TO STRING YOU UP TO THE MAST AND USE YOU FOR A SAIL! PUT ME DOWN!""
 Insert much footkicking, flailing, and squirming. You'd think she'd get /used/ to this sort fo treatment by now. No, and she only makes it worse by drawing attention. You know, because shortly after she's heard yelling again. 
""AND WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ALL LOOKING AT! Why DOn't you take a damn pic- PUT THAT *(#&(@*&(* CAMERA AWAY!!! .. Did you just take a... I WILL FIND YOU AND HURT YOU!"" ....... ""YEAH YOU'D BETTER RUN!"" Squirm squirm. My my she's hollering herself hoarse isn't she? And then her attention goes back to the Captain. ""LUFFFY!!"" This is SO embarassing! HISS! SPIT! FFFFT!!




Ah, there's the farmhouse now.  Luffy seems oblivious to anyone else noting the captain carrying the navigator around like a sack of flour, completely focused on the task of getting back to the alchemist's house to let his family know what happened.  If anything, he spends the rest of his attention on keeping Nami's struggles from getting her hurt - namely, by making sure she doesn't wind up making him drop her accidentally.  Because that'd be -really- asking for it.

Hello, Winry.  Don't mind this disheveled guy in shorts, red vest, straw hat and woven hemp sandals just marching studiously up to the door with a fuming, infuriated (and admittedly somewhat feline in behavior) 'Tangerine Princess' being carried over a shoulder.

Having reached their destination, Luffy puts the struggling Nami down promptly, placing his hands on his hips.  He opens his mouth to say something, grimaces, and puts a hand to his throat for a moment.  Ahem.  ...Okay, better.  ""Chotto matte kure yo, Nami,"" he manages, a little rough-voiced, and cups his mouth with his hands.  ""OOOOOI!  You live with Edward, right?""



FINALLY! She's put down! And yes, she will hold off of the unholy beatdown, particularly when she hears how rough his voice sounded. So while Luffy is trying to get the attention of Winry, Nami leans forward a little, peering at his throat more carefully. Hrm Do rubberboys bruise? Probably not. She rests her hands on her hips, eyes slanted in displeasure.. ears back, tail lash------ oh wait, nono. Scratch the last two. No pun intended.
 
Either way she /is/ the epitome of a very angry kittycat. Only the human version of a one. She draws in a big breath and HUFFS it out in a slight grunt, dark burgundy eyes flicking away from the Captain towards the woman on the porch. And considering she looked like she was five seconds from throwing something, Nami takes about three steps in the opposite direction of Luffy. Hit -him-, not the Navigator, please.




She is RIGHT THERE, Luffy, no yelling necessary. Besides, her hand loosens and drops down to her side - /AWAY/ from the hidden wrench that is...well, /probably/ there. Even if you can't see it, it's wise to assume she has one. ""Yes,"" she answers, walking down the steps and across the yard to come meet them at the gate. She still looks confused, but a lot less like she's going to bean them with something, slipping her hands into her pockets. ""He isn't home right now, though. Did you want to wait for him?"" Lately she's been in the habit of bringing in Ed's friends (and the occasional ninja) and giving them something to eat while they wait. Why not two more? Even if they are a little... weird.



Luffy -does-, it's just that they tend to fade rather quickly.  After all, he can bite his own lip and bleed from a hard enough punch, and even an unbreakable garotte can leave a mark.  It won't stick around for long, though, and that's part of the Devil Fruit's power endowed on his body; rubber's elasticity and resilience.  Though his attention seems to be on Winry, grinning, as Nami peers at his throat he casually covers it with his fingers.

He's, uh, got a sore throat.  Really.  Does he even CATCH colds?!  According to him, he never has.  That's debateable in itself.  ""Ooh, good, good.  I got some good news, and some bad news.""  He's still grinning, and puts his hands behind his head, rocking back on his heels.  ""Um.  Good news is you'll have one less person to feed at dinner!  Bad news is some vampires showed up to drag Edward off to Winterheart for 'justice' and we couldn't kick all their asses.""

More soberly, he adds, ""Sorry.""  He won't mention he was going to give up willingly to save them.  Why?  Well, he knows he'd feel like SHIT if someone sacrificed themself on his behalf, and he's pretty sure Ed's family will have enough trouble with his disappearance as is.



Covering your neck with your fingers will only make Nami wanna see it more! >.< She'll just bide her time - and her patience pays off when Luffy puts his hands behind his head. On the plus side, she's not going to point it out while he's in the middle of telling poor Winry about the disappearance of one of her friends. Oh if it were a much worse injury you bet she would - she'd have even probably dragged -HIM- off to get his injury seen to. And wouldn't /that/ be a sight? The last time Nami ever dragged/carried Luffy anywhere --
 
Let's not go there. >.>
 
Still, did he have to put the 'good news' quite like that? This is probably why Nami scowls, lifting a hand to -smack- Luffy upside the head. *twap!* ""When did this all happen..?"" She asks instead, resting her hand back on her hip. Honestly, they can't leave Luffy alone for a /minute/.



Good news and bad news? Concerning Edward? That slight frown on her face says she doesn't really trust it, since news like that was usually something like, 'Good news: Ed's alive! Bad news: I need you to make replacement automail in the next twenty-four hours!' And then she had to kill people and not sleep at all. And then-- uh. Vampires? Winterheart? Justice? Winry continues down the walkway, brow furrowed - there's confusion, /intense/ confusion, but worry and slight panic, too. ""Wait-- what do you mean? What justice? Where's Winterheart? The hell, /vampires/?!"" See, it might be a dream, but it should, at least, be a dream that makes /sense/! And Winry is very, very confused right now.



Goddammit, Nami, don't take advantage of Luffy's short attention span!  You were SUPPOSED to pay attention to Winry.  It's okay, so long as it's not something that'll interrupt the message being delivered.  Luffy nods curtly and turns a glance to Nami, blinking.  ""Yeah, just--""  Did you peek?! <_<;  ""--Just a few hours ago, I think.  I'm not sure.  How long was I gone from the ship?""  About six hours ago, he left the ship to go for a walk.  There was enough time to run into Edward and fight with vampires, so he must've been unconscious for some time before he ran into Nami.

Luffy addresses Winry again, scratching at his cheek just under the scar beneath his eye, other arm behind his head.  ""Uh, dunno.  Winterheart's this cold city full of obnoxious bastards way south from here.  They seem to think Edward did something to their missing leader, so they're dragging him off.  Lotta vampires work for Winterheart, and it's a dangerous place.""
 


Pay attention to Winry? Why? She wasn't holding jewelry or money; she wasn't even talking directly to Nami! n.n Therefore Nami's interest in the other woman was minimal at that moment. Still, her attention goes from one to the other, gauging reactions. Peek? Her? Can't imagine why you'd think so, because she's not even glancing at Luffy when he casts that suspicious glance at her. o/~ Though she does look back towards Luffy to answer his question, ""About six hours."" Ignore that slightly narrowed gaze. Because once Luffy's looking away, she's peeking at the throat again; real quick, before she turns to Winry, ""It's not far from Promethea, I think."" That is, if she has her directions right. She hasn't got her map to consult, and she isn't one hundred percent certain of the area around Promethea, so she could be off by a few degrees. A slight wrinkle of her nose, and she rubs a hand behind her head. ""There were a number of vampires leading the attack on Middleton too, for that matter.""



VAMPIRES?! PROMETHEA?! JUSTICE?! Excuse Winry as she goes a little poleaxed and twitchy-- though she does look at Nami when Middleton is mentioned. She remembered /that/, someone telling her about a war there. Itsuki? Maybe. ""...They have Ed,"" she says, more of a statement than a question as she looks between Luffy and Nami. And then her jaw hardens, hands placed firmly on her hips as she steps up to the both of them to glare. ""/Well/? What are you still doing /here/? Talking to me isn't getting him back any sooner! Does he need help? He has friends here I can talk to and inform..."" Give her answers and give them soon, because her thumbs hook into the waistband of her coveralls - presumably near the wrench stuck there.


""Un,"" agrees Luffy, glancing at Nami with a small nod.  ""That's because their boss is that Harth guy, that one that was riding on that huge dinosaur during the attack on Middleton.""  He lifts off his hat and rubs a hand through his hair, until a small pebble is freed where it had kind of lodged against his scalp during his few-hour nap on the road.  Aheh.  ""Hm.  I guess vampires only like working with more vampires or someth--uwah!""  O_O;

Are all girls scary when they glare like that?  Luffy backs up a step, eyes wide, and waves his hands in front of himself defensively.  ""Uh, dunno anything else, just that he's probably in Winterheart.  I've never been there, and we'd never catch up with them by now.  I'm just here to tell you.""  He sobers, crossing his arms with a small noise in his throat, probably his attempt to clear it.  ""...Sorry, I won't chase him to Winterheart.  I have my own people to look out for.  My recommendation is to stay here and be safe.  Things may work out, or they won't.  The last thing he or you needs is one of you being used as a hostage to make Ed confess to anything he didn't do.""



That's right! Luffy only came to give Winry the information; They're not heroes gallavanting all over the world to save everyone and their lost kitten. Especially not for -free-. ""Sorry, but you really are better off getting help from those other people."" The other friends of Ed that Winry had mentioned she was going to inform. Does Nami feel bad that she doesn't offer to help out Winry's friend with his problem? No. Not even the tiniest. And even if Winry /had/ offered money, Nami would have to .. -gasp- .. decline on her part in it anyway. She has .. other duties to attend. And not all of them were related to the Going Merry's crew.



...Are you kidding? You /have/ to be kidding. Teeth almost bared now, that wrench is /whipped/ from Winry's overalls, poking Luffy firmly in the chest. ""You won't go in. And you're telling me I shouldn't go. /But/ you're telling me I should get help from other people. And you know what that means? That means that this place is /dangerous/, that Ed is /in trouble/ and that the most you'll do for anybody is come and tell the people who love him so they can sit around and WORRY and feel /pretty damn helpless/ otherwise! What good is staying here and being safe if you know that people you care for are /elsewhere/ and /in danger/?!"" That statement is punctuated with another forceful shove of her wrench before Winry looks incredulously between Luffy and Nami. She simply can't /comprehend/-- that they would tell her that Ed is in trouble, that Ed needs help and oh by the way, don't go help him and oh by the way, we're not going to help him either.



The wrench is permitted to poke a few times as Winry speaks, but finally, it's grasped, twisted out of her hand and whipped off to the side, spinning into the grass.  ""Urusai!"" yells Luffy, voice cracking.  He pauses but a second, and when he speaks again, his voice is again a little rough around the edges.  ""Shit happens!  Take care of what you've got,"" he adds, thrusting an arm out to point into the farmhouse, ""At least you know, and two days, three weeks, five years down the line you're not wondering where that guy disappeared off to!""

Luffy's expression is blank for all that his words seem heated; he turns away, shaking his head.  ""We're pirates.  We can't help you.  Help yourself.  If you get yourself killed, you'll do no one any good.""

It's cruel, but it needed to be said.  They're pirates, not heroes, and that sentiment has seen a lot of use in the last few weeks, especially when it came to Middleton.  



She's shocked-- or as close to it as can be, eyes wide and lips parted as her wrench is knocked out of her hand, falling back a step or two. But as he speaks, she strengthens again, straightening, jaw tightening. Her eyes and throat burn, but she'll no sooner let either of them see her cry than to hand over all her automail. ""Shit /happens/,"" she agrees, her voice near as rough as his. And then a hand lifts, pointing straight at Nami. ""What if /she/ was Ed? What if it was /me/ telling you that /shit happens/ and to take care of what you've got because /at least you know where she is/?"" She glares at him a moment longer before relaxing, slowly and with deep, near heaving breaths. She doesn't look back at the farmhouse, but-- she gets it. Alphonse and Nate and Nina... she couldn't go breaking down and being stupid because it would allow them to do the same.

She turns, crouching to pick up her wrench, using the angle to wipe her eyes dry before standing again. She doesn't look at them both again, though, eyes slightly averted. ""...Thank you. For telling me."" It doesn't matter that her mantra is 'its just a dream' - her fear, Ed's absence, and the gratitude in those two simple sentences for Luffy... those are real.




Hey, if Luffy hadn't said it, Nami would have. Winry will get no help or support from the redhead, who's gazing off into the distance, her face nondescript. It sucks doesn't it Winry? But Luffy is right. They could have just seen to their own, instead of telling you what happened to Ed. You could have spent days without knowing what had happened to him. At least now you know what happened, and you or whoever else, can get together and try and get Ed back - or do whatever it is you want to do about the situation.
 
As she's pointed at, Nami only regards the blonde for a silent moment. ""If it was me, I wouldn't want my friends - my /nakama/ to come after me, into a place that would almost surely mean death for them. Putting my friends in danger is unforgivable."" Especially after all they've already been through. ""But with those guys,"" a small shrug, ""Telling them 'stay away' means nothing. They're the sort of people who would go through and back for their friends."" And Nami would do the same; put her life on the line, to keep them safe. And she has, even now, though they don't know about it. 
 
""Look on the bright side,"" there's a bright side? ""You have a few options left to you, at least,"" Nami remarks breezily. ""One,"" she holds up a finger, ""You can sit and worry, knowing where your friend is and do nothing about it, or wait till he - or some well meaning soul there - manages to free him. Two,"" another finger is raised, ""You can get together with your friends and Ed's and make an attempt to rescue him, even though there's a chance that you could get killed, captured, and/or used as leverage against him, or three,"" the third finger is raised, ""You can stay behind and send off a search party yourself, spending the days worrying about what was happening, if they were successful, or if they weren't successful."" 
 
She lowers her hand, brushing fingers through her hair and shaking her head. ""Either way, do what you want. We won't stop you - Luffy did more than what was expected of him just in coming here to tell you what happened. He didn't have to do that. But if you expected him, or any of us, to put our necks on the lines for your friend, you're looking at the wrong people. We're pirates, not heroes."" She highly doubts Winry is the sort to just do nothing; even if she herself didn't go to Winterheart, she'd at least try and send her friends/rescue party to save Ed. And she knows the woman is upset and either crying, or wants to cry, but Nami ..really couldn't care less. 
 
What, is she going to stand there and cry about it, instead of getting together with her friends to get to save the person she cared about? ""If it were Luffy, or any of the others, I know what I'd do."" Nami adds helpfully. ""Do you?"" She's got all sorts of options after all, but which option will she take? This is not including the ones she may have thought of, but Nami hadn't - or any sort of idea that the future rescue party might plan out too.




That's right.

Shit happens.  Sometimes, it even introduces itself.  Kuro, Arlong, Sir Crocodile, God-Eneru--they're endless.  Shit happens.  People get hurt, even die.  Or spend years of their lives in conditions unbearable for any human being.  Shit happens.  Protect those important to you and move on.  Shit happens.  Make the most of it before you lose it all because you were too busy bemoaning your own misfortune.

Luffy doesn't even follow Winry's gesture to Nami.  He only puts a hand to his hat, nudging the brim down to cover his eyes.

It wouldn't.  Nami would never tell her nakama to 'stay put'.  That's the difference between Edward and Nami.  Nami knows she can't stop her nakama from tearing the world apart looking for her, for all that she does so much to, often at her own expense, protect the safety of those precious to her.  What Winry does about Edward is completely up to her.  Nami's words only verify this; he glances at her out of the corner of his eye and puts a palm on his hip, other hand on the red cloth band around the crown of his straw hat.

""...""  There's nothing left to say.  Nami is more eloquent than he.  ""If you do decide to go, stop by at Middleton first.  I'm sure there's lots of people there willing to take up arms against the vampires.  It's to the south.""

""Iku ze, Nami.""  He starts to walk away, then pauses to wait for the navigator.



Winry hates being told she's wrong, or talked down to as if she's been acting like a child. She especially hates it when it's true. Which is why, though her hands ball at Nami's words, she lifts her head to meet the woman's eyes-- and says nothing. Ed got hurt. That was nothing new. But the other thing that was nothing new was knowing Ed was hurt and feeling completely and totally helpless as to what to do about it. Winry knows very well that she's no good in a fight, would have no idea what to do even if she /was/ in one. She's quite aware that the best thing she can do is tell Tony-- more wisely, Mustang. And then-- well, then she's quite aware the best thing to do is sit back and wait.

But when it comes to the Elric brothers... Winry gets sick of waiting.

Clutching the wrench in her hand hard enough to turn knuckles white and still meeting Nami's gaze head-on, she manages to say softly and with no hint of anger, ""Thank you."" But that's it. She'll turn to go inside after that and let them go their way. Message received, loud and clear.


When you act it, you get treated as such. Sometimes, it takes a little harshness to get the point across. You can't expect everyone to jump to the rescue, and it's not even because they're cold-hearted or anything. It's just life. Sometimes it works to your advantage, and sometimes not. ""Good luck."" Is all Nami offers, before she turns and heads after Luffy. Don't think she has forgotten about that injury there, buddy! And don't think she won't headlock him for a look either!"

"event","After the Straw Hat Pirates go to Middleton, pick up Bova, wind up in the middle of an invasion from Winterheart forces, and subsequently flee with a number of the city's residents, Luffy takes some of what he learned to go check on a fellow Chosen -- Oilbird's Priest.

<b>Note:</b>  This is based on the idea that Luffy threw a party on the Going Merry.  I plan on doing this in the near future!  I just need to touch base with Aoko and find out if I dragged her back with me. :O

<lj-cut text=""Celebrate with me! Okawari? Hoatzin & Oilbird's Priests Talk!"">


Many people lost their nerve and fled Middleton.  Luffy fled because he didn't want to lose his nakama, didn't want to see them die, even if they'd be back again in a few days or a week.  We're pirates, not heroes, and the last time they saved a kingdom was because it was a dream for one of their nakama.  Middleton would not be able to stand against another onslaught like the one Luffy witnessed; you didn't have to be a tactician to understand that.

Looting, naturally, occurred, and the crew returned to Golden Hall with a few extra people and quite a -lot- of loot that would have otherwise gone to waste.  Food and drink were two of the things Luffy was careful to bring back with them.  Nami loved treasure more than anything.  Usopp brought back supplies.  Zoro?  Zoro was pretty happy with the booze and had taken good care of the Going Merry.

...Airships!  He'd talked about them almost all day, until he announced that they really should have a party, celebrating... what?  Who cares!  They're alive and well, let's celebrate!

It's during that party that Luffy wanders, whistling, down the path to the Rockbell farm, with a large barrel carried one-handedly over his shoulder in spite of its weight, two barrel-like small mugs and a bag hanging from his fingers.  Knocking is a matter of kicking at the door until someone answers.



What the shit is this on his doorstep? Hark, verily, it's a pirate bearing grog and -- god knows what in a sack. Edward, on the other hand, is just finishing up cleaning up after his foster-Elrics, dinner now put aside, kids in bed or down elsewhere for the night, and -- Edward? He's just got some work on his desk his room. At least, until banging at the door gets him out of his room. He wanders down the hall, in fluffy slippers and comfortable clothes, and -- opens up to --

""Luffy!"" Well, it's Hoatzin's noisy bastard priest! He grins a little and then peers at the barrel and bag. ""Nice to see you made it out safely, and well. You-- doing alright?"" he asks, and then waves a hand. ""And... what's all this, then?"" The hell is in that barrel, aynway?



For the hour, Luffy's remarkably alert.  They have several helpings of food to thank for that, and the fact that when well-fed, the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates is notoriously, impossibly energetic.  

Oh gods.  Fluffy slippers.  Those strike Luffy as abruptly very amusing, so he's trying to answer in the middle of a lot of laughter.  ""Ahahaha--Edward!  Hee hee hee hee,""  Give him a moment.  A/HEM/!  ""--Come out and celebrate with me!  It's really nice out!  I brought nikuman.""  The bag is lifted.  Nikuman?  Those are puffy white steamed buns with a filling of minced pork and seasoning.  There's a reason he loves these.  They taste really good.



Fluffy slippers. His feet -- well, foot -- gets cold. Common, among amputee -- less blood to run around, less heat to the body. Edward's never really /warm/. It's why he can run around in leather pants at midsummer and not break a sweat. So he blinks at little, and then asks, ""Nikuman?"" He kicks off his slippers, getting boots on over his stockinged feet, and then grabs his coat and slides it on. Shaking out his hair -- currently loose -- from his collar, he comes out with Luffy at his request, hands in his pockets. ""...I 'heard' about how things went."" With Hoatzin. Roc. Those sort of things. ""Did you get my package?"" he asks, then, a moment of thought later. ""I wanted you to be taken care of.""



As Edward comes out to join him (personally, Luffy's dressed in the usual red vest, denim cut off at the knees, sandals, and a large, red-stained and gold-trimmed captain's coat with the Straw Hat Jolly Roger emblazoned on the back), he slings the arm bearing the two mugs and bag of warm nikuman over Edward's shoulder for the express purpose of giving him a nearly crushing hug.  And then drag him along down the path with him, grinning.  ""Uh-huh.  Thanks, it came in really handy.""  Well, it winded up in Nami's hands, since she handles money a lot more responsibly than he does.

Briefly, Luffy wonders just how -that- message came across through Oilbird to his Priest.  What, like getting the utter shit kicked out of you, since he can't literally see it himself?  It's probably not polite to ask, but the pirate does so anyway.  He's not very good at thinking things through in most cases.  ""How did you hear about it, anyway?""



Poor Luffy. NEver one too bright. Edward is crushed against the Pirate's side with -- well,he's still got his bones in all the right places. Grunting once as he's released -- well, as the arm loosens -- Edward stumbles along beisde him. ""That's good,"" he offers, hands still in his pockets, glancing to the mugs that clack against each other over his shoulder. What is this? He doesn't ask, though. He just lets himself be steered down the street.

""Oilbird told me,"" is all he can answer -- Oilbird's about hard penance, about redeeming under your own power, about -- well, contrition, sometimes, rather then redemption. A little blood, a little hurt, is no stranger to an Oilbird chosen -- especially not his priest. It's probably little wonder that Ed's as joyless as he can be sometimes. He's been set on a hard road. ""You seem to have bounced back admirably, though. Tough pirate, eh?"" He grins, then, and says, ""Did you come back to Middleton straight away?""



There was a particularly insightful man who once said he suspected Luffy only enjoyed playing the fool, something to which Luffy had only responded by grinning.  But whenever any of his nakama get the idea that his foolishness is mischief instead of mere stupidity, he does something to reassure everyone that he's as simple-minded as they come without being a vegetable.  

Works every time.

A little blood, a little hurt.  Luffy's no stranger to these, either, but in his case, he's been given a powerful gift to physically bounce back after some of the hardest hits, and his simple nature makes it easy for him to slough off more complicated, negative emotions that might try to stick around.  Water right off a duck's back.  Luffy is lucky, indeed.  ""Hehe, I have strong friends, so I'm strong, see?""  His friends were there for him, and he's there for them.  In his worldview, all is good in that case.

But it's a nice night, so let's take a walk, share something to eat and drink, and celebrate a single moment where there's peace here, for now.

""That looks like a good spot.""  A flat stone marker to lean on, even.  By it, he puts down the barrel and sets about adjusting the tap.    ""There!""  The bag is thrust out to Edward.  ""Have one!  We came back after I picked up a few things.  And people.  What's going on here?  It's bright over by Golden Hall.""



Wandering out of the village, the light does get dimmer the further you go, into a near twilight state. ""Yeah. Seems first Winterheart takes the Moon, then it blocks the sun. It's still going -- you can still feel the days go by."" But... there you are. He's not overly worried. Didn't run down to Middleton to take care of things. Just -- stayed put with his family, for a change. Sliding his hands through his hair, he looks back at the artifical sun and then shrugs a little. Not his problem, really. But then he looks at the barrel and tap, before he sits down, folding his legs underneath him for a while, looking to the big thing again.

Okay, he'll bite. ""Luffy. The hell is that, anyway?"" he tilts his head, and pokes it with one hand, metal fingers not feeling it one bit. ""I mean, it's -- a bit much for two of us, isn't it?"" Which means he can't use any excuses not to drink it if it's what he thinks it is.



""I never knew anyone could do that,"" answers Luffy, who with a sharp twist of the tap, finally has it facing the right way.  He tips the barrel over onto a knee as he crouches, flipping the tap to fill each mug with an amber liquid.  ""I guess if they can steal the Moon, anything could happen.  Omoshiree na~, kono kuni wa,""  Rough translation?  This country's really interesting.  Need he sound so amused in a dire situation?  It's just his way.

One mug is offered, ""Try it!  I had some in a Middleton tavern.""  What is it?  It's some kind of fermented drink, like beer with some kind of fruit infused.  The result is something that tastes vaguely like blueberry beer, without the blue.  The only problem is it's slightly bitter aftertaste.  It goes very well with the nikuman, and that's probably why Luffy likes it.

""I don't know what they call it,"" Luffy says, parking himself by the keg to drape one arm over the top while he sits in a casual sprawl on the ground.  ""I heard those guys from Winterheart might try to use Middleton as a base before attacking Golden Hall.""  Rumors abound, of course, and Luffy doesn't care about a war between Good and Evil so long as his nakama are safe and his dream is still something he can attain.  Well, he IS a pirate.



""So much for two months of sobriety,"" Edward says, looking into his mug quietly, before he takes a taste -- ooh, fruit-------- augh bitter. He swallows hard, making a bit of a face and then shivers a little. Hmm. Well, if he's gotta break sobriety, maybe it'll be something worth while. But -- yes, give him a bit of that nikuman, he'll munch -- munch more then drink. No reason to go to excess.

""Don't know what it is, either,"" he says, having never tasted it before. He was never much a beer drinker. But -- ah. Yes. Eh-heh. ""Yes, that's very likely, Luffy."" He considers that for a moment, and then says, ""We're prepared, if it does. And -- there are people here who want to help the people there. And we will."" He smirks a little, and then sips his blue-fufu-beer, getting used to the taste with the sweet-sharp taste of nikuman in his mouth to ease the bitterness. ""Why do you bring it up? It's not anything you'd be involved with.""



""Huh?"" Here it comes.  Luffy tilts his head to the side, mug up to his mouth.  ""What's sobriety?""  It just figures!  It's not like Luffy makes a habit of drinking; he didn't much at all, and never to get drunk until that one time at the bar with Arlen, the same fateful night he learned the song that would forever haunt their navigator.  'Hey Jude'.  It's just that Luffy is so often silly that some might assume he's on permanent 'tipsy' mode, but that's just his hairtrigger sense of humor.  

At Edward's shudder, Luffy snickers into his mug, shoulders shaking from mirth.  It's good, isn't it?  In a place like this, the range of experiences is vast.  You could find something you only ever dreamed of.  Naturally.

Reaching into the bag for a nikuman, Luffy adds, ""Aa.""  Yes.  ""It's not something I care about, but I think something like this is more dangerous for you than me.""  He nods away from the village, presumably in the direction of the coastline.  ""There's always other islands on the sea, always other places to go when you have a ship and no attachments on the mainland.""

Hold the phone, is he being serious?  He smiles, though, and pauses to swallow a bite of nikuman.  ""But for someone like you, you have people to protect here, na?""  He looks into his mug, studiously, as he adds in a light tone, ""Stuff that's happened before that you don't want messing them up, right?""




""I used to live like that,"" Edward admits, setting his mug aside on the stone to roll out of his coat, wad it up, and use it as a pillow at the base of his back, getting into a sprawl. He doesn't want to explain sobriety -- it'd take too long, and he's not sure ol' Luffy would /get/ it -- so he just sips his beer and munches his nikuman. ""When we were small, we decided to reach our goal, attain our desires, we couldn't have a home to go back to. So we set fire to our house, and we set out... We never went back. At least, I didn't. I think... Al made it home, some day."" He looks to the sky, then, and smiles. At least, he hopes Al made it home.

but -- wait, what's this? Edward blinks wide eyes at Luffy. Serious? Yes, well, that is odd. ""Yeah,"" he answers simply. ""I do. There are -- people I love here. People -- I owe debts to, as well. I don't want to see any of them... hurt."" He tilts his head, almost asking 'where are you going with htat', but deciding he shouldn't. whatever Luffy wants to get out, he'll do out in his own sweet pirate time. ""It's -- nakama. You understand; it's -- just my view of that is... maybe, wider then yours.""



""Hey, you got it!"" chuckles the pirate in the straw hat, who lowers his mug to only grin.  ""Na, Edward.  The important thing about 'nakama' is what it means for you.  If it's someone else's definition, it doesn't work so well.  They're -your- important people.  You'd be surprised how many people have a hard time with that idea!""  He squints a moment, brows furrowing.  Did that come out coherant at all?  Oh well!  Luffy brand Logic(TM) is a little bit strange, but then, he IS Hoatzin's.

((When we were small.  When we... we never... I think Al made it home--))

""Al is your brother?""  Hey!  Powers of deduction sometimes actually function with Luffy's hyperactive braincell.  ""Does he live with you in that house?""  A hand points off in the direction of the farmhouse, while he chews on the rest of the nikuman in hand, washes it down with the contents of his mug.

He'll wait for his response before pressing on.  ""That cold bastard,"" Luffy says against his mug, words slightly muffled, ""Really did a number on you, huh.""



No, that came out perfectky; Edward's glad that his comprehension is on, for he smiles for it -- another one of those rare things, warm and pleased with himself, and the thought. He likes that nakama word -- even if he had to expand his to many people rather then just a crew, or just a family, or just -- well. Whatever he chose to expand it /to/. Nakama. He'll remember that one. He'll have to teach it to Wrath, and to Nina, some day, when they're old enough to get it -- Wrath, maybe now. Maybe he could use what it means to figure out where he belongs. Or maybe... it'd just help him realize he's /where/ he belongs.

When Al is brought up, he nods once. ""Ah, yeah. Al's my little brother. And he does, yeah."" He brings his drink up to his lips for another swallow, and then says, ""He and my dad, and then my little ones, my kids -- they're there too. We used to have another, but she's not with us anymore."" He takes another swallow of his beer in the silence that follows for a few seconds after; but Luffy's question makes him choke on the fluid in his mouth. He swallows hard, and then sets the mug aside, bringing up his hand -- tugging off his glove, he wipes the froth from his lips, blinking his eyes. ""What-- what was that about?"" he asks, his eyes cold. ""Cold-- bastard--"" He doesn't mean -- not Harth. Not -- the thing behind him...?



Nakama has been something of a golden word with Luffy.  Too much of gold depreciates its value, but there are times, tones in which it's said, where it's almost a word with its own strange power.  Sometimes, it cuts through everything, all barriers around a heart and drives home the point that his nakama are HIS nakama, and that nothing, no apparent betrayal, no obstacle, no difficulty would get between him and those important to him.

So he's pleasantly surprised when people understand the word and adapt it to mean something special for themselves.  It's something about leaving a mark on the lives of the people one meets that makes you a living part of history.

Edward has kids?  Luffy blinks at him, and then smiles, a little too innocently, ""You okay?""  Don't choke!  His smile fades a little, and he swishes the contents of his mug around a little before topping it off with the keg, putting it down, and offering to refill Ed's.  ""Daijou~bu.""  It's okay, he attempts reassuringly, ""Roc's got a big mouth. Seconds?""



Yeah, he's gonna need some more beer, he is. He finishes off what's in his glass, and then passes the heavy mug to Luffy. Sure, fill it up. If he's going to break sobriety, he's going to do it in style. Ahh, drunk. He missed you so much. ...god he's gotta work in the morning. Oh well. Tony will live, right? Right? Eh-heh. 

Shuffling off any thoughts of being overly responsible for the rest of the night, Ed relaxes a little, and then says, ""Yeah. So does his priest. I-- I knew the risks. People were being hurt. I didn't want them to suffer, you know? I saw -- what he did to a /party/. People laughing and happy and -- they /bombed/ it. And I died to save them. Was really easy. Dying. The -- rest that came later wasn't."" He shrugs, though, and then, once his beer is refilled, takes a more healthy drink of it, and chomps up a nikuman. Mmm, good food, and good boose, and yes, good company. It makes anything easier to bear. ""...You saw him, then. The God himself -- not his vessal."" Not Harth Fray, but /Roc/.



Barrel-shaped mug refilled, passed back to Edward, Luffy's content at the moment to fetch himself another nikuman and chew on it.  There is little out here to distract him, so all his attention is focused on the Alchemist.  Some of his own crew might be surprised to find him so attentive, but he's got good reason to.  It's only if Edward shows signs of being particularly awkward about said attention that he'd promptly become distracted by the contents of his nikuman or mug.

Or perhaps he intuitively understands that by making as if it wasn't a big deal, Edward would be more comfortable talking about something rather acutely unpleasant.

""Mmhm,"" Luffy says, swallowing some of his drink with a nod.  ""He said a lot of stuff that pissed me off, so I tried to send him flying with a punch.""  One fist, holding the remains of his nikuman, lifts briefly, then drops to his lap.  ""Didn't work, though, he's too strong,"" he says with a brief laugh.  

More seriously, he adds, ""No wonder you don't smile so much.""




Edward has his attention on the beer, and the food, and the quiet of the evening beyeond the sunlight of the hall. He likes it out here. He can hear crickets, chirping, somewhere, thinking it's nighttime and wondering why there's no no sun but that /place/ out there. Edward is just happy for the burn of liquor down his throat and the warmth that spreads through his limbs, real and unreal. 

Hit him. Edward laughs, then, and shakes his head, ""Bet it was like punching a glacier. Hitting his priest was like punching a rock -- like a steel girder. I was more likely to break my fist then give him a bruise. You gotta lot of balls, Luffy, to take a swing like that."" Harth was just the man, the vampire with the gift. Roc? Well, that's sort of going to the source, the direct /thing/, like arm-wrestling with sin itself. Not that Ed hasn't duked it out with a few of his own, but... well, that's different. He's pretty sure Roc make homunculi look like pansies and swings arms like tree trunks. 

...But he has to say that. Smile. Hah. Edward just shakes his head. ""It really wasn't so much that... as that I was all alone there. No one came for me. For over a month... it was just them... and they kept asking me, 'Where are your friends? Are you so bad that no one wants to come get you? That they've forgotten about you? Do you matter so little to the people that care about you, that they'd leave you here? Don't they know what you're going through here?' And after a while, I couldn't answer them. I'd tried to be strong for them -- they wanted to hurt them through me -- but -- I started asking that same question, eventually."" He shrugs, and then sits up. ""I know why, now. I understand. But -- it doesn't make any difference. You can claim... someone as Nakama, I think, have someone be that important to you -- and eventually realize... what you feel about them is nothing like what they feel about you. It hurts, more then what they did to me there, to know... what I came home to.""

He sits up abruptly, taking up his mug. Alright, if he has to take about this shit, he's not doing it sober. He drains half of it, and then settles the mug own again, and then says, ""It doesn't matter, though. If my suffering -- if it spared lives, if it saved others, then I'd do it again. I'd go in and never come out, if other people would be spared hurt. My life isn't worth anything, if it's not lived for a purpose. If that was all I could do -- then I'd do it. If someone needs me for that, then fine! I just -- want to know htat they need me for it. Not that -- I'm a tool to be cast aside after.""



Luffy?  He has this bad habit of trying something even after people say repeatedly that it's impossible. Sometimes, he's just lucky enough, just strong enough, just determined enough to make it through and succeed, though there's always times when he's spent all his luck just to get himself out of an impossible situation alive.  In the case of trying to hit Roc (a number of times, as another bad habit is Not Knowing When To Quit), he had his remarkable luck taking on the form of Hoatzin spiriting him away before he was torn from the Dream entirely.

Ever since he asked Zoro 'Hey, join my crew', he's never been alone.  So he doesn't know what it's like to be asked that question again and again.  He doesn't know that kind of doubt and he's grateful for it.  And perhaps it's in not knowing this doubt that made him so determined to search for Nico Robin, even after she'd told Sanji and Chopper 'good-bye' at Water 7.  He's quiet, therefore, though it could just be the drink mellowing him out for the moment.  Luffy puts the mug down and pulls a knee up, crossing an arm over it and putting his chin on that arm.

Reaching for another nikuman, he takes a bite.  There are a few left, he'd brought a lot, simply because he knows he EATS a lot, and figured Edward might be hungry too.  He has no question of the loyalty his nakama have to him, but saying so, he thinks, would be precisely the wrong thing to say.  ""Sou ka.  Part of that's the same here,"" he adds, grinning, ""If it's to help my nakama live or reach their dreams too, I'll do anything.""  But then, he knows he's not a tool for his nakama to cast aside.



Edward doesn't know that anymore. Already, he has been -- sure, they're not his brother, but it still stings -- left to his own devices, forgotten... no longer useful. Burdensome. He never wanted to be anybody's burden! He became a dog of the military so, even though it meant shuffling off his humanity, to be a weapon of war some day, he would /be useful/, to others and his brother! He would -- go that extra mile, so they could attain their goals.

((Do you hate me? For what happened? I've been afraid you'll say 'yes'... ))

 He stretches, and takes longer, heavier drinks, feeeling warm, now, a little floaty. Ed's got a tolerance, though--it's just a buzz. He won't be drunk yet. Not for another few mugs, anyway. ""I knew you'd understand,"" he says, and he means it. To know -- how it is to feel like that. ""My brother, he has this friend -- Tobias. I like him a lot. He reminds -- me of family. He's -- nakama. I guess."" Something like that. ""He -- says the best way to make my brother happy -- which is basically all I really want to do anymore -- is to be happy myself. And that's a hard thing to ask me. I really -- don't get 'happy' anymore, unless... I'm working at making someone else happy. It -- used to be really easy, to be selfish. To ratinoalize our losses, the death and the hurt that followed us, as nessecary to our goals, our punishment for sinners. I even told myself, here, 'It's like hating a snake for biting you', when I was -- in Winterheart. You don't /hate/ a snake for being what it /is/. It's stupid. A snake's a predator. So's a vampire. The difference is a vampire enjoys your suffering. A snake just swallows you and doesn't think anything of it."" He frowns slightly. ""Why are we talking about this?"" ...You know, he just realized he's babbling about stuff that /sucks/. That /hurts/. Can he go back to his happy denial and swim down that river again?



Instinct.  It's never done Luffy wrong, and while he's mystified by the tragedies some other people can endure while having a seemingly charmed existence himself, he has a feeling it's best if he lets Edward just -talk-. It's not that Luffy's life is easy, it's just that when situations happen that would crush someone else, the complicated emotions that would cause it to become 'tragedy' have a very hard time sticking to a mind as simple and straightforward as his.  It doesn't -stick-, so much of his conflicts are resolved through more direct, physical confrontation.

Let him talk.  That's all.  Luffy has no advice to give, no answers, no preconceived notions.  When was the last time the Fullmetal Alchemist had someone around who came to a matter, cared enough to push and poke and investigate it, and once that can of worms had been opened, didn't fuss over getting his hands dirty and just -listening- instead of trying to fix it, lay down some kind of judgement or opinion?

He has the feeling 'too long' is a good answer.

((Why are we talking about this?))

""Why are you not?""



Instinct is something that serves Luffy well in deed. Really; who could Ed talk to about this? Curtis -- who is dead, now, gone. He couldn't say anything to Winry -- it hurt her too much, made her /hate/ this place. When Al finally got here, it was -- it was something he was trying to put away. When Buffy came into his life, it was something he could tell her about, but -- it served a purpose. It wasn't about him -- it was about Harth. So she knew what she was dealing with, what she could be up against. It wasn't really about him working it /out/, getting the shit off his chest and lancing a wound so it could finally heal over and be a scar he could talk about some day.

""Because,"" he says, after a moment. ""It -- when -- it all happened, afterwards... after I pushed it away, forgot it... a few of them... stopped acting like there was something wrong with me. If I didn't -- I got hurt agian, a few months later. I was all messed up in the head. Couldn't remember things right. People -- stopped acting like I was some sort of /thing/ rather then /Edward/. They relaxed. So once I remembered... I just -- didn't say anything. I let them think I'd forgotten. They didn't -- welcome me back, but -- they didn't push me away anymore. At least..."" He thought so. Then again, sometimes he's proven wrong. 

He goes quiet, now, though; now realizing he's been dumping his problems on another who just went through a harsh beating and battle, and escaped with his Nakama intact... well. Blah. ""Give me another nikuman,"" he says, and then goes to get one. Arr, food. If he eats, he'll be happy, and not talking.



Details would probably disturb Luffy, but at least it was something he could shrug off.  He's of the rare type of person who sees the world in such simple terms that the cold, wicked truth of the world could make itself known and he'd still possess his innocence.  He isn't naive when it comes to the base, important things, though he seems to be terribly naive about a lot of common, yet complicated things.  Some people find it endearing; most find it absolutely infuriatingly frustrating.

Luffy just likes being able to laugh.

""Aa, sou ka.  So that's it.  Huh, that's funny,"" Luffy says abruptly, nodding.  He stands up, looks over his shoulder, walks around the stone marker, investigating their... surroundings, apparently, before he sits back down, leaning against the keg.  ""Don't see any of them around.  Don't see anyone, really.  I'm just a pirate; we're the lowest class of people.  What would I be doing judging anyone?""

Nikuman?  One is pulled from the bag, tossed in Edward's direction.  ""Go ahead.""



Yay! Nikuman. He takes it up and munchs again, quiet. Still, it is strange to have a thought of thinking anyone lower then him. He's had a long time to settle there, with the thought of himself on his belly like the snake he so often compared Harth too. He thinks about /him/ for a long moment, too; the muddled feelings, anger and hurt and yes, strange empathy for the boy that hadn't been strong enough to turn from Roc, to -- take pain and make it strength. Edward, even as unhappy as he could be, was still one-up on the vampire boy, and hat was something.

""And-- really, I don't know. Man who gives me the most shit is a murderer,"" he says with dry frankness. ""He took an order, when he was young -- to kill two innocent people. He was, like I was, a dog of the military. But -- he decided... he'd be something else. He'd climb his way up... and be something more then that. To get to where he didn't have to get his hands bloody like that... follow a bad order."" He wants to respect him, love him as the surrogate, often-absentee father figure that he was in Ed's youth. But he can't anymore. Disillusioned with the false parent, he's found respect and empathy with the real one... who is no less a sinner then Edward, and makes no pretention to being otherwise.

Strange how things turn out, he decides.

""What did he tell you?"" he finally asks. ""Roc. I want -- to know how much you know."" He tilts his head. ""Only-- two people do, really. What -- those Justices, and Harth, did to me.""



Indeed, it's very strange how some things turn out.  Not 'work out', because sometimes things happen, and they're not always functional the way circumstances have evolved.  Shit happens.  Sometimes, really bad shit happens.  There's a funny thing about it, it stinks, and people tend to avoid it like the plague.  So those enduring great suffering typically find themselves alone in it.  

Occasionally, there are people like Luffy, who either don't mind the smell of trouble or aren't afraid to get their hands dirty if it's for a good cause.  Good is always relative; what Luffy considers good here is he's giving someone a chance when they haven't had it for a while.  Listening isn't all that difficult to do.

Answering Edward's question, however, is.

He looks over the rim of his mug at Edward for a long moment, and then lowers the brim of his hat over his eyes, leaning against the keg.  Hm.  ""Roc, na?""

""Roc has a ...really big mouth,"" he repeats with a small nod.  ""I don't think I have to say anything else.  One man's pain isn't another man's entertainment.""

And that there should be enough.



Work out? Ed hasn't had anything work out in quite some time. It's hard, you know -- to have struggled so long, only to find you have to struggle for whole new things afterwards. Attaining one goal just closed that door and opened another one -- a less certain ideal, a less obvious purpose, a need to do /something/ to fill in that time he had built up...

...only to find that he wasn't wanted or needed. That frustrated him the most. He didn't have /purpose/, or the clarity that came with it. Oh, there was being lazy, and there was being lazy... when you weren't needed, taking a break frmo the grind. Edward didn't mind breaks. But he did mind being useless... and forgotten.

So he sits there, contemplating Luffy's answer. ""No,"" he says. ""It is. I've seen it a lot--people who take joy in other's hurt. It's a sad thing, to watch someone's eyes light up because they hurt another..."" he tilts his head, but, ""I've been guilty of it too, I think, when my enemy is on his knees. ...Felt guilty, after it. For being able to hurt them. First time I killed a man -- I wept for him. And he wasn't even human."" He's not weak, though. He doesn't /think/ he is. He wants to be /strong/. He wants to be -- human. He doesn't even want to be a hero. He just wants to be someone that can have the words 'I can depend on him' be applied to. 

It should come as no surprise that he tries too hard, gets discouraged, and then fluctates between trying even harder, and wallowing in his depair.



Things generally work out in Luffy's case; things happen, shit goes down, and every time it's 'Things will work out' and 'It'll be okay' and it's -true-.  Most of the time.  Some, if not all of their immediate issues are resolved in some chaotic blur and there's peace for a little while.

But they've always been on the move, this crew, even while the Going Merry's been anchored by the same docks for a while, now.  There's been a lot to see, a lot to do, and there will always be more problems to face, more obstacles to struggle against and overcome.  Accomplishing one thing lead to another problem.  But to Luffy, a problem was an adventure.  He tries to make everything fun, it's just his nature.

Someone once remarked that Luffy was charismatic.  He just considers himself very, very lucky.  He was, as a captain, a pirate, a friend, wanted and needed, because he wanted and needed others, and he was completely unashamed of proclaiming this.  It wasn't -the- way to live, but -a- way, and it worked rather well for him.

""For someone else, maybe.  For me?  I want to kick his ass for thinking it's a good time.""  Luffy's tone is light and a little flat, his eyes in the generous shadow of his straw hat, mouth hidden by the prompt rise of his mug to it.

He drinks.

""In your case, I won't say 'It'll be okay', because I have a bad feeling about all this, so I'm keeping my important people close.""

""What I -will- ask is, 'Will you be okay?'  But I'm not sure there's an answer to that.""



Draining the last of his mug, Edward sets it aside and then moves his coat-pillow to more comfortably support his head. He lets his eyes lid, heavy now, wiht the lateness of the evening and three potent, fruity beers in his belly. Two months sober. Not a bad way to blow it, he decides. He won't again. Last time, last time. But how many times did he say that before? Ah well. Just another slip up. He'll have a few of them -- one step forward, two steps back, with Edward Elric. One of these days, he'll get the two-step down.

Blinking his eyes, he tilts his head. ""Part of him-- part of his /Priest/--"" he clarifies that, as it's important, ""Is not a monster. There's something inside that's worthwhile. I've seen it. Held it, touched it -- tried to help him-- reach that. Once. He-- wasn't strong enough. It was easier to be cold and hate everything... and I feel stupid, for wasting so much time -- trying to help someone who wasn't strong enough."" The fault was not with his efforts. He knows that, very well. He did everything he could -- more then he should, really, giving Harth compassion and kindness and love, only to come back to an empty warehouse, with only a sorrowful message left behind. He brings his hands together, then -- bare, from coming out of the house so late...two rings, one white, one black, on his left hand. It's the ebony one he touches, considering the memories it holds.

""I'll be fine,"" he says simply. ""I just think -- there are things that some people are not cut out for. Not everyone can be a genius alchemist. At hte same hand -- not everyone has the simple things that make them a good friend, or a devoted brother, or a husband or a lover or a father.. It's simply-- trying to find what ones I am good at, and sticking with them, and not trying to hard... at the things I know are beyond my strength. Maybe someday I'll be stronger."" Strong enough to make Winry happy and ease Al's worries, strong enough to be respectable and wanted by his peers again. Strong enough to be something other then Oilbird's priest. 

""I want to be strong, but this is strength -- I just don't comprehend. /You've/ got it. So many -- if I know you, I'll figure it out, in time... if it's something that can be attained, or something... that has to be there already... You are strong, Luffy. Really strong.""



((Are you guys always like this?  What was that talk about not giving up your life so easily?!  You guys wind up taking such dangerous risks all the time!  Wouldn't it be such a waste if you died that way?))

""You saw something good in someone everyone saw something bad in.  You fought for it.""

((Ha ha, they -are- fatal risks, huh?))

""You believed in that good thing you saw.""

((That's nothing to laugh about!  Aren't you afraid to die?))

""You failed.""

((I am.))

""So WHAT?!""

((Then why?!))

""You gave it your best shot, you did what you could,"" barks the pirate heatedly, dropping a palm down on the keg's wooden top with a dull thunk.  Its contents slosh audibly.  Luffy's frown fades, shoulders relaxing.  He carefully puts down his mug.

Are you asking why, Edward?  You seem to, to Luffy, asking 'why am I fighting?' 'why am I living?' 'why am I lying about how I feel?' 'why can't I make this work?' 'why not -now-?'  At the root of it all, the pirate in the straw hat keeps getting this sense of a thousand 'Why?'s clustered together like so many specks of sea foam on the shore.

"".......""

""When I was a kid, I saw saved by a pirate.  He lost his arm while doing so..."" says Luffy, in a very quiet, almost fond tone.

((Don't go off dying like that.  You almost did.  I'm just glad that you're safe.))

""That's why I won't give up on life so easily,"" he says, pulling off his straw hat and cradling it in the palm of one hand, looking into it with a small smile.  There is the subtle crinkle of paper when he runs his fingers over the cloth band around the crown of the straw hat, and his touch lingers there a moment.  ""I'm only as strong as the people around me.  I don't know if that helps at all,"" he says, glancing over at Edward soberly, ""Maybe it doesn't.  But I think strength is already here.  Na?""



Hey. He's being yelled at. Cue Ed's eyes popping open as he sits up abruptly and just sort of LOOKS at Luffy. Stop being so scary when he's drunk! He gets so easily confused, especially with some liquor in in! But he blinks at Luffy, and the way he simply puts it. But he has no words, not at all.

Not until he says, /he lost his arm while doing so.../ and suddenly his automail is a heaviness against his side, a weight on his shoulder.

((I'm sorry; I could only get your soul... with this arm... ))

It takes a human life to restore a human life, in the mathmatics of alchemy. Luffy's rescue was much simpler, much finer -- Edward... he was going to have the weight of his sin against his side, his inhuman body a constant reminder of /yet another failure/. A reminder to himself -- men and children, they shouldn't play God. Not like that. Not with human lives.

But he sits up, there, his hands in his lap, and blinks a little, down at his lap and then Luffy, and he grins a little, and says, simply: ""Glad you think so.""

It's easier to build faith, when someone gives you a rock as the foundation.

He considers, quietly, and then pushes himself up; his leg's fallen asleep. Or maybe it's the booze. Either way, he wobbles briefly, and then puts his hands to the keg, leaning over it, and then plants one hand on Luffy's head. ""Na, Hoatzin-brother,"" he says, simply, ""You're too good to me. Thanks."" It's almost a brush off -- but it's not. Edward just isn't good at saying things like, 'thank you for believing in me, I'll do better from now on' or 'maybe this is the hope I need to go forward' or even 'thanks for the beer, man'.



Rocks can be broken.  Rocks can be eroded away with time.  

Build your foundation on something -stronger-.

""Here.""

That'd be an arm when Luffy stands, facing out past Edward's metal shoulder, an arm laid at first across his collarbone to steady him, before he turns away, his arm shifting with his movement to support him behind his shoulders.  ""Come on.  It's that way, right?  Leave the keg.""

The drink, it doesn't matter.  It'll be there tomorrow, perhaps a farmer would take it away.  Or maybe it'll stay there until rain warps the wood and its rings rust and it falls apart, becomes food for fungi and moss.  Its fate doesn't matter, but its contents did some good while it was around.

Didn't it?  Two months of sobriety broken, but all in all, it wasn't that bad.

""Too good, huh,"" mutters Luffy, with a chuckle in his throat, his straw hat back on his head of disheveled black hair, ""You won't be saying -that- when you wake up with a headache, chibi-ossan.""  No, no.  That's precisely how it should be done.  No 'thank you for this', no 'good bye, take care'.  It's okay to make familiarities and fumble with words sometimes.  A person who makes mistakes and apologizes for them is easier to trust than a man who seems to be perfect.



Mutter, grumble; good arm slung around Luffy. ""mmm not short."" He knows what Chibi means! HE KNOWS. Sort of. IT MEANS ULTRA TINY ITTY BITTY SMALL And ED IS NOT SMALL. OR ULTRA TINY ITTY BITTY EITHER! So he grumbles with it, sliding his free hand through the hair. ""You're a terrible person."" What happened to wonderful and strong and all that crap? You called him short. That dissipaits all gratitude in the face of rabid overcompensation and sensitivity right off. He's /delicate/ when it comes to his /height/, dammit. Delicate! And sensitive. Did we mention sensitive?

Leaning on the pirate, he does glance back at the barrel, but doesn't make a fuss about it, or whatever nikuman remain or-- anything, really. Luffy's a warm support against his side, and then he says, ""Won't wake up hung over. Will drink... water when I get home. Lots of it."" He's not all that drunk, really -- just a little past buzzed, enough that with weariness, he's less then steady. But that's alright; he's got someone to lean on. Isn't that what everybody needs, sometime?

Somebody to lean on?



Truthfully, Luffy's rather light-headed himself.  His metabolism is capable of keeping up with his eating habits, so he plans on walking it off.  For the moment, he's helping Edward get back home, his home, the farmhouse that seemed well-lived in, the place where his important people lived.  ((You're a terrible person.)) earns Edward a throaty chuckle in genuine amusement, the pirate's head bowed and shoulders shaking.  ""Sou ka naa?  You wouldn't be the first to say that.""

((You made me live when I wished for death... that is your sin.))

((If it's like that, then there's nothing I can do.  Ii zo.))

""Drink a lot of water?  What for?""  Hung over.  Hung over?  That sounds like hanging the wash.  No, actually, the last (and only) time he's been drunk he felt -horrible- the next day, like his brain had been wrung out and left to dry.  ""Ohh, you mean that headache?  Is that all it takes to cure?  Ha ha ha, sugei na.""

And that's all.  Just someone to lean on, to keep pace with you, all the way to the front door, where he'll at least not palm his head to indicate he's short, but he'll wave just the same.  Grinning.  ""Ja na.  I've got a long walk ahead of me.  You too, but first, you sleep!""  A finger points authoritatively at Edward, before he rests it aside his nose, smiling.  ""Captain's orders.""



Captains orders. Commander's, once upon a time. Now, he takes Tony's orders, but -- doesn't think anything more of it. He just walks along, his alcohol fogged brain heavy with contemplation. He has a lot on his mind, but -- it isn't as heavy as it has been in the past, so he can't complain -- just like Luffy can't quite contemplate the hangover that Ed might be flirting with. The Alchemist just chuckles; leave it to the rubber pirate to be hang-over immune.

But now? He's on his doorstep and he's off Luffy's support to get to the door. ""You get some rest, too,"" Edward says with a smile, nodding his head, before he swats that hand away playfully. Go on, captain. The Elric needs to go back to his fuzzy slippers and leave off his work for the night and sleep the sleep of the well rested."

The All Gods Temple is basically as Edward Elric described. A large, squat building that seems, at first glance, only so large, but inside -- the space seems to ... expand. A trick of the mind, perhaps, or something else? At the door, six robed figures stand, cloaked in three colors -- Good wears Gold, Silver for Evil, and Bronze for Neutrality. Six flank the entrance at all times -- two of each color -- when a priest enters, they present cloaks of the appropriate color wordlessly, and wait for a moment. Usually, folks know what they want. And sometimes, they know what folks want before /they/ do. Who knows if this will be the case when Hoatzin's priest walks through those large, double doors to find himself swathed in heavy robes and treated like a visiting dignitary. It'll probably be /lost/ on Hoatzin's priest, but... still.



"".....""  It feels like stepping into a library.  It's quiet.  For a moment, Luffy stares incomprehendingly at the offered bronze robe, before belatedly accepting it.

It's all fine, especially if no one gives him trouble for insisting on keeping his straw hat.  If it's absolutely necessary, he could always let it dangle from a string around his neck, underneath the heavy robes.

Treated like a dignitary?  The captain of the Straw Hat Pirates is used to two things: trouble and fun, and situations are typically observed with a blank expression most assume is stupidity until he's filed it in either category.  For the moment, Luffy's taking all this with a neutral mien.

Why are they -looking- at him like that?  Luffy opens his mouth, inhaling.  Alright, time to ask where he goes to speak to Hoatzin.



Well, one would go: They're waiting for you, Luffy. But poor Luffy, he doesn't know what he's getting into. Still, the Keepers of the Temple just look at him for a moment, and then part -- the Silver and Gold Priests just step away, while the bronze-garbed men lean onward into the temple, before they enter the center. They want to -- what, now? Well, they're offering him two choices. One hand extends toward the Chambers of Twilight, where the half-light of the place exudes a sort of calm, and the other tilts his head toward the Cloister. What's your purpose here, Priest of Hoatzin? They ask, but without words or voices. They know what you're here for--but you have to seek it to find it.



Luffy has two very strong traits on his side.

His luck is legendary.  And his instinct is near-supernatural sometimes.

Although his choices sometimes land him in trouble that seems hopeless, somehow things work out, be it at little or great cost.  The important thing is a simple truth he's come to rely on: Things will always, eventually, work out.  Persistence, determination, skill and a little luck has brought him through everything up to this point.

This is how a straw-hatted youth with disheveled black hair can walk right into a Temple of All Gods in a strange world and have no trepidation about what to do, or where to go next.  He's here, and taking steps towards whatever he should be doing next.

So take steps.

Forward.

There was nothing calm about the vision he had received; calm seems to be a thing -earned-, not taken prematurely.  So, still blank-faced, he turns on a heel and strides on sandalled feet for the Cloister.

Answers, not rest.



No peace for you, then, Luffy. There is a resounding intonement: ""Priest Challenges Himself,"" and -- well, it's not the first time it's been heard in these halls. The cloister flames light, blaze brightly, blue and red, and the cloister doors swing open, leaving nothing but misty gray dreamstuff beyond. Go in, Luffy, and you'll find your answers-- as well as the doors shut /tightly/ behind you, vanishing into the ether of the place.

It is only Ether for a few seconds though, before color and texture explodes into being, simply being nothingness at one moment, nearly sense-deprivatory, and then the planks of the Going Merry is under those sandals and the sun is out and the Grand Line beckons beyond the crash and rise of the salt sea. It's a beautiful day to sail! Adventure and happiness and friends!

Only there are no friends. There's no crew on the Merry. It's silent, besides the natural ambience of the sea, and the creaks and groan that accompany a ship like that at all tims. He might wonder where his beloved Nakama have gone, if it weren't for the fact that someone is bounding down from the wheel, to -- uh -- shake a fist at Luffy.

Only, it's Luffy. But it isn't. It's Luffy if he'd been dye-died and put through a playdough noodler, maybe; limbs aren't the right length, his neck's too long and his eyes too big and dark, there's no scar, and the HAIR. Oh god it's like a rainbow crapped on his head and he rubbed it around! And he's looking at Luffy, big eyes dark and black and full of stars.

""GREAT DAY FOR SAILING, HUH?""

He /sounds/ like Luffy, but -- there's something not right to the voice, to the manner. He's all sorts of -- just plain off. And this, sir, this is how you see Hoatzin.




At first, Luffy only boggles, mouth slightly agape.

Eyes turn sideways one way, then the other, and down to the planks beneath his feet.  Perhaps someone else would have felt a pang of nostalgia, a longing to return to more familiar adventures, a desire to find things Forgotten.

(( What kind of name for a treasure is 'One Piece', anyway? ))
(( Luffy-- ))
(( You shouldn't talk like that about your dream! ))
(( Huh? What's this 'One Piece' got to do with being Pirate King? ))
(( .... ))

""...Uh-huh!"" comes Luffy's grinning agreement, pulling his straw hat up onto his head before reaching out, if only to clasp his warped mirror by the elbows and throw back his head in full-throated laughter.

Hello, Hoatzin.  Have you been lonely?  A ship like this, it really should be filled with friends.  

Come on, then.

Let's talk.

""We've got a lot to talk about!""



Why do you think Hoatzin loves Nakama? His people, his strange, lost people... 

He starts toward the fore deck, staring out over the water. ""We're going into choppy seas,"" he says. ""And the water is red there. Think we can man this ship, just the two of us?"" he asks, pointing across the waves; there's a dock, far off in hte distance, but the water around it is bloody red, thick and raging with the fury of a storm; the winds that blow from it are cold, fluttering the sails and making the ship creak a little louder. ""They need us,"" Hoatzin says, ""Need us, Luffy! We've gotta give those people... a place to get away too!"" And then he's springing up to the wheel, turning it on a coarse for /that/ port, those bloody seas....

...did you say you want to talk? I'm sorry; Hoatzin's a small god -- he doesn't really... get communication very well.



Think we can man this ship, just the two of us?

""Ha ha ha ha!""  Laughter here may have not been so reassuring, but in Luffy's throat it's something that comforts -him- just the same.  ""Not at all!  I can't cook, or navigate, or take care of the ship, or fire a cannon.""

""But that's why I brought my nakama.""  And they're here, always with him, though they aren't in this temple.  Handle the whipstaff and steer the ship towards those ruddy seas, and Luffy will take up his place as always.

Atop the ram's head that is the figurehead of the Going Merry, to watch the choppy waters.  ""It'll be okay!  Everything will work out.""

They need a place to escape to?  They.  They?  ""It will!  We'll take care of all of them!""



Alright, then! THey're off, eating up leagues in what seems like seconds, as the water beneath gets red like shark-feasts and choppy like a hurricane's kissed it. But Hoatzin is a good -- well, everything. He's everywhere at once, it seems, if Luffy glances back, an entire Nakama to himself, to work the boat and make it /sail/. But the water is still red, and as they near the port, is crusted over with ... ice and frost. Soon, the shipm is plowing through the thin ice that hasn't been broken up in the chill storm that threatens to freeze poor Luffy's hat to his head. The winds are so cold, and the masts are frosting over and the sails stiffening... 

""I don't think we're gonna make it!"" cries Hoatzin. ""What are we gonna do?""



Legs stretch and wind at the ankles under the ram figurehead of the Going Merry, securing himself in spite of the cold.  ""Get out of our way!""

Hollaring at a storm won't make it go away.  But if they're having trouble going to the port, then...

The winds tear his hat off his head, but the cord strung around his neck, the one that Nami had sewn into the band of the straw hat Shanks had given him, keeps it from becoming yet another piece of debris claimed by the storm.

""We'll bring it to US!"" yells the pirate, squinting into the icy wind, pulling back one arm.  ""GOMU GOMU NOOOO!""  ....HONESTLY, /must/ he announce when he's about to call on his body's unnatural elasticity?  ""ROCKETTO!""  And--out his arm will stretch, flung out ahead of the ship, through the bitter cold if only, only for a single hold on the undoubtedly icy planks of the dock.

And pull, like a living tow-line, if his grip holds sure.



It's like holding dry eyes; it bites at the skin and renders fingers bloodless as that fluid retreats to less chill regions of the body. IT's so cold! So cold it wouldn't be a sin to let go, it'd be self-preservation. It'd not be a dishonor. He's pulling them in, they've made it this far--but it he lets go, it won't be his fault; who would call against him, with that...? Who would, indeed? Hoatzin wuoldn't, who whoo-hoos at the wheel, as he steadies the ship. ""Keep pulling! Keep pulling, Luffy! We're almost there!""

And who is that, waiting on the dock?



It wouldn't be a sin to let go?  Maybe for anyone else.  It'd be giving up when he's striving for not just his own nakama, but those of the bird who had chosen him as his representative.  

It would be like letting go, when climbing the sheer mountainside of that wintery island had cut open his hands and left more than half of his body frostbitten.  It'd be like giving up just because it was too hard.  Too hard?  What's up with that?

Well, perhaps it's alright if he does rub briskly at his arm near to the shoulder, teeth chattering, even as he pulls.  It's -freezing-.  Is there a place anywhere on the Gameboard this -cold-?  It itches at his memory like a grain of sand in the scalp, probably something that'll come to him accidentally, perhaps even wake him right out of peaceful sleep with the answer.  Or maybe someone will say it for him in casual conversation.

It'll work out.

Luffy's still squinting against the wind, but as they draw closer, he squints less for that and more to see through the red sea spray at who or what it is already waiting for them.  ""Who is that!""  he calls to Hoatzin, over his shoulder.




Hoatzin begins to wait, then, his hands leaving the wheel, leaving the boat suddenly stormtossed. ""It's him! The cold man! The southener! The big R!"" He wails, then, wails. ""He's breakin' the law, breakin' the law!"" Singsong, just as strange and warbling as one would expect, he is chao-crazed now, shaking as he begins to duck down. He's not strong enough to face this god--not even with Nakama, not even with his BEST Nakama /ever/! 

Because this is the lone killer, the raging ice storm, the Lord of Terror himself. He stands, so casual -- heavy, wreathed in black and silver, on the dock, unaffected by th storm -- as if he himself were it's eye, tiny and focused upon his shape and nothing else, leaving everything else in chaos and rage around him. He looks at the hand on the dock, then and lifts up a heavy boot, with cruel teeth upon the soles, and brings it down to just /grind/ on those cold, rubbery fingers. IT's lke they're just been stabbed by /icicles/.




The cold man.
The southerner.
The big R.

At first there's a feeling of hot rage bubbling up from inside, to hear fear in the voice of his strangest of all his nakama.  Who you are.  Where you came from.  I don't care about such unnecessary things!  You DON'T MAKE ( --my navigator cry-- ) ( --light of his dream or I'll kill you-- ) HIS NAKAMA AFRAID. 

Not like this.  And hot fury's just enough, just enough to warm him in all this cold.  And enough to feel every stab in his numb hand.

The storm swallows up his scream, but that's okay (because everything will work out, someday).  By the end, it's become an outraged roar the wind is free to snatch away from his lungs.  That's okay.

He cannot (will not) let go.  He's here for a reason.

He's fought gods with all their thunder.  ""KAKATTE KOI!""

COME
GET
SOME.

Or he can let go of the Going Merry's figurehead and come to you.




Aww, look! He's coming to play. Roc stands there. If Luffy perists in swining at him, the God -- clad in heavy armor, though it seems to fit over-large on a small frame -- and the square glasses don't /fit/ with his lord-of-terror image -- will stand here. And it will hurt Luffy to hit him more then it will hurt Roc. Roc merely /stands/ there, looking down upon him once the pirate's impacted and bounced to the dock, to just look at him, and then at the ship.

""He can't help you here. I hope you understand that. You're nothing. He's one of the smallest of the small gods. He doesn't even /take a side/."" He pauses, then and then lashes out with the suddenness of crackling lightening, to swing his booted foot to try and cave in poor Luffy's torso. He's going to beat you, boy. And make you know: You're a small, small mortal in a game of Gods, and you're /not/ playing for the winning side.



There's two sides, in Luffy's opinion.  There's HIS side, with his dreams, his nakama, the whole of his adventures - both experienced and those yet to come... and then the OTHER side, which either waits to be overcome, defeated, left behind, or in some cases, brought over to his side.

Knives was defeated and found another path, and joined, tentatively, what Luffy calls His Side.

It's like hitting bedrock and just bouncing off.  But it shouldn't -sting- that much; bludgeoning damage does little more than leave him winded, for the most part.  ""I don't need his help!  Leave his--GH!""  

That hurt.  Enough for spots to dance in front of his eyes.  He's rubber, it -shouldn't- hurt that much.  Pardon the pirate while he attempts to breathe.  

A small, small mortal (yes) in a game of the Gods (he doesn't -care- whose game it is) and he's not playing for the winning side.  But is it about winning, or the road well-traveled?  He wheezes.  ""Leave his nakama alone,"" coughs the youth, throwing the whole of his anger, all of his enraged confusion behind a single punch.  

But that's the armor of a god who's been winning for the last ten years or more.




""Nakama,"" Roc says, his voice mockingly like Edward's for a moment, ""Just means you have more people to hurt. More people to lose. More people who /suffer/. It means that when I hurt one, break one, rape one, I break two hearts, three hearts, four -- with just one person's suffering. It's beautiful -- that domino affect. It's why you lose, little boy, LOSE. It's why you're weak. If you watch out for just yourself, you have nothing... to lose.""

He opens his palms to accept that punch, catching it as if it were nothing. He's the Lord of the Gameboard, the Master of Fear, the Stormbird, the Cold Feathers. Don't you know you can't fight him? 

""I am every ounce of suffering. I live in the blood of your Nakama on the decks of your ship. I in Riza Hawkeye's heart, as she murders her comrades. I am Edward Elric's agony and confusion, suffering for months in Winterheart while no one came for him, raped and defiled for a boy's amusement. I am Angelus, cracking open the skull of Betsy Braddock for all to see my might and power, defiling her body before the men and women come to support her! I am Million Knives's apathy, inhumanity, as he kills people like insignficant insects... kills your navigator, your swordsman..."" He reaches out, his arm cracking out, ""And you took that one from me, child. But I'll have him back. I'll have them all in time! I am called /fear/ and /teror/ and /evil/ and /hate/. I am murder, rape, and theft. I am lies in the dark. A dagger in the back. My name is Betrayal, my blood is ice and /you/... you are a simple-minded /child/ who cannot comprehend my power or greatness. /You/ are Hoatzin's because you're /weak/ and /small/ and your /nakama/ will be in this city when it falls to it's KNEES and realizes... you have to take sides. And it's going to be mine."" 

He swings again; he won't break his jaw, no, but he'll leave that rubbery face purpled.

""You're done here, Priest of Hoatzin. Leave Middleton. Run as far and as fast as you can. Stay at the edge of the storm, and you might survive. We'll see how far the Going Merry can sail before my wings overtake hre, my shadow eclipses her, and you find your dreams sunk like stones at the bottom of the wild tide...""




Luffy's punch is caught and this time, this time there's no snap of small bones.  No, Knives' hand had broken that time, but here's an opponent who isn't feigning a lack of injury betrayed by something he can feel and hear.  This is surprise dawning mutedly when the pirate snaps his chin up with eyes wide too late.  

He's heard every word, which is why when that swing connects, it turns his head with it, feels his own teeth bite the inside of his cheek.  One eye winced, but the other widens.

Luffy understands why smiles seemed unused to a face like Edward's.
Why Knives--Arlen, tires of life and needs an Aspiran and a god's rule to guide him.
He understands - just a little.

And for just a moment, he wonders again why the Moon is never in the sky when you want it the most.

""No,"" is almost an inaudible utterance. That second swing sends him staggering.

(( my shadow eclipses her ))

""--won't let you,"" coughs the youth, tasting blood between his teeth when he grits them.

(( you will find your dreams sunk like stones ))

""NEVER,"" roars the captain, ""Everything started here!  I don't care about your stupid game!  Middleton will LIVE--""

(( I am murder, rape, and theft. ))

It's guys like (Kuro) (Arlong) (Crocodile) (God Eneru) you that really piss Luffy off.


""Middleton will fall,"" the God says, advancing; it's a flurry of strikes -- he takes his time, to break bones, to work past the projection of Devil Fruit has blessed the pirate with... But his attack is cut short -- love intervenes. Hoatzin loves his chidlren because no one else will, loves them all in their freakish strangeness... And he wants Luffy to live and find his dreams.

He doesn't want Luffy to have a face like Edward's, where smiles are so unsuited, or a spirit like Knives, where his heart is broken and another must hold it up lest it crumble beneath the weight of his sorrows.

Luffy can feel the fluffry of wings, then, a kaledieoscope of color embraces him, Hoatzin's ragged sobs as he clutches to his priest, sweeps him up in a safe embrace. ""Don't, don't, my nakama, I can't, I can't! Don't die, don't die, if he kills you, if he shatters you, I can't bring you back. Don't let him rip you up!""

And then it's the emptiness of the void, feathers of blood and pain all that comprises Luffy's world-- his brains rattled, the vision fades, and the doors open; men of the cloth come to pick up him. In the Cloister torches, Luffy's torch /snuffs/... and the Challenge is regarded... as a failure, but Hoatzin's love and respect lingers; he is proud, so proud -- you stood up to him, for all, for the world's nakama! But against impossible odds, who could fault him for making him that far, only to be crushed beneath the weight of a tyrant's claws?



He's unused to the sound of his own bones breaking.  There's a point at which all the cold and pain mingle and take the edge off each other.  A point where he hears the impacts more than he feels them.  Physical pain?  It's something he's not afraid of, not when he has something worth fighting for, someone worth dying for.  There's a point when he notices the sky again instead of Cold Feathers himself, fingers twitching, and wonders which will stop first.

Roc?
Or his body?

( feathers in the dark again )

And he can't die, he -can't- die, not here, not now.

He has to return to his nakama.  He has to go.  

Now.

But Hoatzin's already swept him away, and it's only that urgency (now now now) that bleeds seamlessly into a panging in his skull, as if someone where taking potshots at the side of his head with a hammer, again and again.  

He gasps, a torch goes out and for some reason that's -important-, but all he hears is (feathers) the rustling hurry of others in heavy cloaks.  Someone barks a laugh and Luffy wonders why -he's- the one left aching for his trouble.  Why is he laughing?

He's alive.  There's still enough time.  There's still enough time!  There's still--

Darkness, everyone's old friend, eventually, but this will be an oblivion of sleep for now.



<b>OOC:</b> Ok. Apparently he got shuttled off directly to the Healing Hands hall in critical condition.

Um, oops.

Luffy would be <i>insistant</i> that a messenger be sent to --well.  Here's assuming we took up residence for the weekend in an inn at Middleton (after Usopp's Friday birthday celebration) on Saturday.  Message is, basically: He's at that Healing Hall and has important news.  He wasn't awake long enough to give a better message.  Sorry guys. -_o;"

It began with a steady pounding on the front door to the farmhouse.

Luffy had traveled there alone, clad in the usual denim cut off at the knees, woven-hemp sandals, red vest, straw hat, looking a lot more like just some average teenager from the street than any pirate with aspirations to becoming Pirate King.  No pegleg, no eyepatch, no hooks or other such weaponry where a hand should be, not even a talking parrot.

No, he only took one look at the blonde who answered the door, grabbed him by the wrist and started walking away.  If Edward had tried to drag his heels, Luffy's arm would have simply stretched.  Either way, at the end of the path to his door, the Captain of the Straw Hat Pirates looked over his shoulder.

""Hungry?  I'm buying.""  And smiled.

He was true to his word, too, if Edward didn't mind pub food, or seeing Luffy proceed to try to polish through several plates of edibles.  He'd taken a table near a window, and was currently pulling a shred of meat off a bone when he took to actually talking.

""Na, Emfwha--""  Chew.  Swallow.  Washing it down with a swallow of whatever it was that had come in a tankard, he drags the back of his hand across his mouth and continues.  ""Edward, right?  Oilbird's priest.  What's that like for you, anyway?""



Nobody ever hauls him out for just socialization. But the boy needs a breather from his own thoats, and for Edward, the best panacea to his own problems? Think about someone else's. He's begining to feel like Akari; if it's not his troubles, it's somebody else's. But something--or someone-- told him to just nod his head and go with the Nakama loving Hoatzin chosen, and-- well, maybe not pummel him this time. Now that he's got both arms and everything, the Elric seems just a little bit calmer, though-- he does pack away food with a skill to almost rival Luffy... He just does it more politely. 

""Difficult,"" he ssays with a smirk, when he's asked about his priesthood status. ""You know, I'm a really -- I'm not the best person to ask about this kinda thing. You probably want a Priest along your own lines, don't you?"" After all, Oilbird is nominally a god of Good, and Hoatzin doesn't play the alignment game. But -- all the same, eh. ""It's hard. Oilbird doesn't send visions, he gives impressions and stupid noises and sometimes even smells and feelings."" He tilts his head, and then adds, helpfully, ""He's blind, see?"" He considers, and then says, ""what's Hoatzin like to you?""



Eating habits like Luffy's, but done in a calmer, more polite fashion?  Sounds an awful lot like his older brother, Ace.  On the other hand, Ace, like Luffy, has a habit of the notorious 'Eat N'Run' technique.  Fortunately, Luffy manages enough pocket money through sheer luck, resourcefulness, and a complete lack of shame when it comes to doing all manner of odd jobs.  (But even his bottomless stomach is consuming his crew's money at a staggering rate.  They'll have to go raid some other pirates or something.)

Luffy literally DID bring Edward out here for socialization, but his method of finding answers is not by seeking advice or divulging his own problems to others.  It's by asking people about their experiences and doing some (albeit odd) connections with his own, and coming to his own conclusions.  Luffy smiles -far- too much to be a man weighed down by anything -- in fact, he's rather childlike in his guilelessness.

""Hou,"" replies the straw-hatted captain, blinking.  ""Difficult?""  He repeats, leaning forward slightly.  And then he remembers his meal and resumes eating for a few more mouthfuls.  ""Not the best to ask?  Why not?  Hoatzin's funny--no one's quite like that weird bird, huh?"" chortles the pirate, putting down his tankard after another long swallow.  He's... apparently of the opinion that things like alignment are of little importance.  Must be nice to have such a simple outlook, huh?  ""Blind?""  Blinking, he's quiet for a moment.  How do you send -visions- if--  A hand drops down into the other palm.  ""AHA.  He's a mysterious bird.  Got it!""

"".....Weird.  Like if you eat a funny cactus and see things.  Or a spider crawls on you and isn't there when you look again.""  Chewing, he furrows his brows in thought (it seems like an awful lot of work to be doing while eating) and as he swallows, he nods.  ""Hm!  Saw something funny lately.  Lots of blood.  Smelled really bad, like- like--""  He waves his bone around vaguely, then peers at it.  ""Like piles of dead things left out too long.  Nakama, na?  Nakama is like the people closest to your heart other than family.  Hoatzin... Hoatzin thinks they're all going to hurt and die, get scattered.""  An abrupt grin, ""What's going on?""



Swirling whatever it is he's drinking -- for once, something non-alcoholic-- in his glass, listening to Luffy bull through his speech. It's-- really like dealing with a very, very happy homunculus, sometimes. He's not human to Ed, and he's-- got an innocence that reminds him of Nathaniel--Wrath--before he was force-fed red stone. It's actually a point in Luffy's favor, but Ed would never say so. 

But he nods quietly. ""Yeah, Blind,"" he replies. ""So -- if I need to see, say, a certain girl, I smell her perfume and hear her voice. Sometimes he speaks to me in other people's voices, see? Or if someone I know is going to get hurt, I can feel a sharp pain and hear their cry. Instead of seeing it -- I sort of -- uh, experience... it?"" He doesn't quite know how to explain how ol' Oilbird works. ""I dream it, sometime, too. Even the blind dream."" 

But he leans back as he explains this 'nakama' concept, and smirks. ""Outside of Al, all I've got is 'nakama'."" Still refusing to let his father share in 'family' title, the grudge-holding little man just considers it. ""Well-- you have to wonder; is it your nakama? Or is it /Hoatzin's/ nakama; who is nakama to Hoatzin? Gods, and all their children? Or -- just your kin? I-- really don't know."" Still, that's a hell of a vision. ""But-- it sounds like you were -- having visions of carnage. Has your nakama had a lot of trouble lately? Do they have enemies?"" Best to just rule out one thing at at time. Yay for alchemists and the scientific method.



This is how Luffy deals with the things that set him at unease, the things that threaten the people he cares most about.  No hesitation, bull through, figure out what you need to in order to move ahead, find the cause of the problem and /kick its ass/.  There's a point where he stops just trying to have fun doing whatever it is he's doing, a point he drops pretenses and focuses.  He's getting around to it.  He's still all smiles and childlike wonder.

There are even moments when Luffy is wavering between the decision to keep eating or stare in wordless astonishment at Edward's recount of just how Oilbird communicates with his Priest.  It's... probably a little embarassing to be gawked at so shamelessly, but Luffy is not at all private about his amazement.  If he's interested, he's /interested/; no one can mistake his fascination for anything else.

""Really?"" beams the disheveled youth in the straw hat, ""Yokatta na.""  To someone like him, there are few things better than nakama.  One's dreams, for one.  Becoming Pirate King is another, though he seems much more all about the -journey- traveled well.

""...We're pirates, we always have trouble!"" exclaims the youth, altogether too happily, ""Mmmn.  We ran into a few enemies we thought were gone.""  Arlong and his saw-toothed Kiribachi sword.  That was... definitely one death Luffy could have done without remembering, but he was defending Nami, so it's fine.  ""They haven't come back to life yet, and that was almost two weeks ago.  Maybe bigger.  Felt bigger.""  Brows furrow.  ""Longer.  Years.""  (( ...Ten years. )) ""...Did something happen ten years ago?""



Edward laughs at that; he's used to being stared at, but it kinda makes him fidgety. He's not doing anything amazing, so you shouldn't stare. LEt him rearrange the entire bar around them; THEN Luffy can stare. Eh-heh. 

Thankfully, he moves on from gawping at Edward to yapping about things. ""It's not that great,"" he says simply. ""Nakama just means, I think, more people that get hurt."" He smirks, though, and adds, ""But at the same time, you can't let them go, and they won't let you go either."" So -- yes, nakama. Edward understands it. IT just makes him a little rueful sometimes.

Still, he blinks his eyes a once, twice, and-- what? ""Ten years? About-- that, yes.. nearly eleven now. ""The moon was stolen by Winterheart, and time here stopped, if tales are true. I wasn't exactly here at the time. I've only been here a year or so... but I lived in Promethea..."" and oh! How he misses that city, misses it /dearly/. No stupid alignment politics, no nothing. If he wasn't so rooted here, he'd love to go back... (If the place wasn't filled with memories from his time, living alone with Winry, in that city... where it was just them, before it got... bad.) ""Story goes like this; ten years, the game was nearly 'won'; Promethea's lord Moira was going to marry the priestess of Phoenix and create a bond between cities. Then Winterheart crashed the wedding, stole the moon, and brought time to a stand still, and nearly destoryed Promethea in the process. So-- that's something that happened ten years ago.""




It'll be a miracle if Luffy retains all of this accurately at all, unless the simpleminded fool has managed to assign it some precious little brain space usually reserved for fascinating bedtime stories or fairy tales.  And this?  This sounds a little like one.  

(( Nakama just means more people that get hurt. ))  ""....""  Luffy's expression goes mildly blank, mouth opening.  He glances down, and resumes the rapid consumption of what's left on his current plate.  The youth wipes his mouth again on the back of a hand, washes it down once more with what's in his tankard (Gods only know what it is, if it's alcoholic, he has no clue, he just picked something with a cool name).

Typical.

""Naruhodo,"" chuckles Luffy abruptly, slapping a hand onto his knee, shoulders shaking with mirth, ""And here I thought the Moon was just playing hide-and-go-seek all this time with the Sun!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Omoshiree naa!""  A nearby table has a couple that have, for the moment, stared in open-mouthed wonder at the fool who thought the Darkening was just a temporary game of hide-and-go-seek.  Do celestial bodies DO that sort of thing?

""Sou ka,"" says Luffy, sobering.  ""What do you usually do, when you wanna find out more?  This thing that's threatening my nakama - mine or Hoatzin's,"" He puts a hand at the crook of one arm, raising the other fist with a thin grin, ""I want to kick its ass.""



""..hide... and..."" Oh god. Ed hurts. He hurts good, because he's laughing, but oh /woe/, it's so simple. Simple indeed. And here, you know, it could really be true. But he just smiles at Luffy, and shakes is head, quietly grinning. He doesn't speak of Nakama; really, he just tilts his head and considers what to say. ""There's a place, in Middleton to the South of here, called the Temple of All Gods. Every year, the Priests meet there at the Games; i had just been chosen befor the games this year -- you'll probably get your first taste of it next time."" Edward? He's hoping to be /free/ of Priesthood by that time; this has been no fun for him, really.

""You cans seek answers there; plus, it's the city of balance, and Hoatzin is a neutral god, last I checked. You might be able to find our more -- messages from the Gods are clearer in that Temple. It's really the only place I know where you can -- get closer, I guess, to the gods."" Not that he cares much for getting close to them.




'Straw Hat' Luffy has a terribly simple worldview.  Most people smack their foreheads in frustration.  Those with patience or a good sense of humor usually play along, but the people who laugh?  Oh, but those people, those people are usually the ones who needed the laugh the most.  And so when Edward tilts his head to consider what to say, Luffy's settling back and dragging his fingers over the front of his shirt, one arm slung over the back of his chair.  Mmm, good food.

Middleton.  South.  Yes, that's where his adventures started in this amazing new world.  He knew the town well, though there was still an innkeeper who kept a rifle just in case the Straw Hat Pirates returned and failed to pay their bill - or pay for cleaning out their pantry before they left for Golden Hall.  But they're pirates.  They tend to mess around with illegal activities, albeit good-naturedly.

""When are the Games?"" asks the youth, bringing up his tankard and squinting into it.  Heyyyy, this smells like something -Zoro- would like.  No -wonder- it tastes so funny!  He puts it back down, innocently.  ""Doesn't matter, I should go there soon anyway.  I made a promise to meet a friend there!  The Temple of All Gods, it must be really high up to get closer to those funny birds, huh?""  



""You'd think that, bit it's not. IT's a big building, and the inside goes on forever--"" Edward smirks, disliking the taste of the next phrase, ""like magic."" Oh, lord, give him some solid science to work! This 'magic' hoohah is-- just that. A load of horsecrap. He taps his plate with an empty fork, considering. ""It's-- well, you've just got to go there and experience it. You might be put to a Test; Priests do that, to -- to each other. It's not out of malice,"" Not usually, ""but to make sure the Gods know what they're dealing with -- and each other. A way of seeing whose in the ... lead in the game, I guess, and to try and one-up the score."" He shrugs, uncertain how to put the workings of the Game-- both the Games of Middleton and the Game they're in right now, into words. 

""Buit if you're going there, it's a good place for you to stop off at. I'm pretty sure it will help you out. And if not, there's always seeking another Priest to talk to.""



Like magic.

Honestly, Edward may have well said 'smells like ADVENTURE', because enthusiasm lights up Luffy's demeanor in the way that Hughes lights up when someone actually mentions being -- shudder to think of it -- EAGER to see his baby pictures of his adorable Elysia-chan.

""Heeeeeh?  REALLY?!  Are you sure?  It goes on forever?!  FOREVER AND EVER?!?""  He's... well, if he were a Font, he'd probably be exuding sparkles in a literal sense, instead, he'll just be thinking of them, very very hard!  ""I have to go!  I really have to go!""

He'd have a few reasons for going back to Middleton.  One, to pick up a new possible nakama.  Two, to find out some more about what his vision from Hoatzin meant and what he can do about it.  These reasons he does keep in mind, even though to all outward appearances, he just seems to be a kid looking forward to a field trip to someplace particularly exciting.

Is he even paying attention to the idea that he might be tested?  ""I can't wait!""

.......Maybe he was.  We can only hope.




...Oh god, he's created a monster. Or an Armstrong.

Edward just sort of blinks at Luffy's WIDE EYED enthusiasm and -- well, for him, it's more like being the deer in headlights. Oh, lord. What has he done? What's he /going/ to do? He's-- just going to nod slowly and hope Luffy doesn't come out of that with his first Test and Challenge being from a particularlly cruel priest, who'd be sure to take advantage of that innocence and strip it bare. With his luck, Devilbird will want to have a peice of rubberboy. ""Just be sure that's what you want,"" he says, thoughhe's pretty sure the warning falls on deaf, if big, ears.



No, no, he's nothing like Armstrong!

For example, HIS eyesparkles are bright, blinding yellow.  ...Just kidding.

If it's one thing the Straw Hat Pirates have become notorious for, its for their enthusiastic activities, be it a party or riding a (terrified?!) Dire Unicorn through Golden Hall or going all-out on a couple of funerals that turned out to (fortunately!) not be needed after all.

Their Captain is the most enthusiastic of the lot, a boundless source of energy and laughter.  He's climbed sheer mountains with his bare hands in the middle of a freezing storm to get a doctor for his ailing friends, been mauled by a shark-man, drowned, dehydrated, buried alive, impaled, poisoned--and able to laugh about it later.

That's Luffy.  And this would be the pirate calling for the bill, rocking back in his chair with a sandalled foot on the edge of the table, a finger in his ear.  Grinning.  ""Uhhuh.  For my nakama, or for Hoatzin's, I can't stop.""  A small chuckle, ""I can't stop for anything.  It's the same for you and yours, isn't it.""



Why does he have the impending feeling of DOOM looming? It's just something -- sticky and cold like -- like something nasty. He doesn't know what that feeling is, but it's a sense of dread. Maybe it's from Oilbird. Maybe it's just him. Maybe he ought to just laugh again and lighten up. But he just nods his head and grins, instead. ""You're good, to be so loyal."" It's a trait Ed prizes; loyalty, to family and kin. He has a hard time with it, sometime -- being loyal enough to stay, rather then being loyal enough to /run/, so he has to give props to the man that can do what he cannot.

Even if he does have yellow eye sparkles.

""Then do what you need to do, and don't look back,"" Edward offers as his last advice. He cracks a smile, genuine and heartfelt. ""Somehow, though, I don't think you'll have any regrets.""



Don't let all the smiling fool anyone into thinking he can't be serious.  Luffy spent quite some time shaking hard enough to chatter his teeth right out of his skull when Hoatzin's urgent vision came a-knockin', kicked its muddy feet up on the table of his thoughts and stuck around a while to regale him on the gory details.  He did a headcount, figured all his nakama were still around and breathing, and calmed considerably.

Then came to the decision he would do something.  That lead him to the nearest, most easily available priest in this region who wasn't bogged down by paperwork and hidden away in a stone-walled office somewhere -- Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist, Oilbird's Priest.

""That makes me good?"" stupidly replies the pirate, scratching his head.  ""Better than being bad, ha ha ha!""  --That compliment?  He wouldn't blame you if you said 'Give it back!' (Nor would it be the first time someone's said it to him.)  ""Mm!""  The chair teeeeters back, but then on the rock forward, he launches himself upright with a foot on the edge of the rattling, dish-laden table, only to hop -off- the table and right into the Alchemist.

It's a move that'll likely spill both backwards onto the floor, still in his chair with a rubber pirate seated neatly, Indian-style, -on- him, arms folded and hunched forward, grinning down.  ""Smiles and laughs like that,""  A hand reaches down to knock knuckles very lightly to his forehead, ""Shouldn't look so rare on guys like you.""  His other hand, which had been pulling a pouch from inside his vest, tosses it over his shoulder onto the table.  There's a jingle of coins.  ""Like I said.  Dinner's on me.  Did you enjoy it?""



Funny, how being unconnected makes Edward 'accessable'. Easy to get ahold of. But he shakes his head, looking down for a fatal moment in rueful amusement. But then, he looks up too late, before he is TOTALLY knocked to the ground with a heavy rubber pirate. Alas, he doesn't smile /now/, because his eyes are spinning in their sockets and he's laid out with the heavy weight of the pirate upon his chest. Yeah, dinner's gonna be on you if you sit on him like that. Barf! 

Well, not really, but -- if you don't get off him, there may be some projectile puking. But he gets knocked about, blinking his eyes and focusing. Whassat? What? Smiles? Ah. ""They're more valuable, when they're rare,"" Edward replies. ""I'm not a guy who is rich in things like that. So I have to savor it when it comes. Now get off me, you great anchor!"" Stupid pirate. Stupid heavy ass rubber pirate.



He's not that heavy!  No, wait.  Maybe he's heavy after several plates of food.  (On a shorty--*bricked*)  Alright, alright, that can't be comfortable after a big meal.

That answer sounds like honesty without excuses, so he bobs his head in a nod, grin sobering.  For only a moment.  Because that anchor comment makes him roll right off in laughter, ""In the water I'm worse than an anchor!"" cackles the youth, proceeding to roll away from the table in a ...rather random fit of giggles.  When he sits up again, it's as sudden as a springboard.

How anyone can be that active after eating that much is one of the world's great mysteries.  Kind of like Sanji's curly eyebrow.  What is UP with that, anyway?

""Thanks,"" says the pirate, stretching out his legs before climbing up to stand, giving himself a cursory attempt at a dusting-off.  ""I learned a lot.""

A hand is offered, apparently to shake, grinning.



You may as well ask about 'how DOES that antenna stay up'. It bobbles back and forth on Ed's head as he clambers to his feet and brushes himself off, looking at the table, before he rights the chair as well, and looks back at Luffy with a grin. ""I'm glad,"" he says, turning around before he's--got a hand offered. Taking that in his own gloved palm, the finger beneath steel rather then sinew, he gives Luffy's hand a healthy pump, before he says, ""Will you be returning to your ship immediately?"" he asks, curious. ""Or is your nakama nearby?"" he asks, curious. Nice to patch things up-- and Ed has a broad view of family--just as he had to have a broad view of what is human and what wasn't, so you never know who is going to be adopted into the extended Elric clan next.



Goodness.  Does anyone back at your home roll their eyes and wonder who you brought home this time?  Edward should hear Luffy's nakama sometime.  One of them said he collects friends like people collect cats.  It's true - not even former enemies seem to be safe, within reason.  There are some people who Luffy simply cannot trust enough to draw into his growing circle of crew/nakama.

The only sign that Luffy's noticed anything odd about that grip is the fact that his eyes (very briefly) glance down at the hand he's shaking.  ""Yeah.  We've got a lot to plan for.""  Eyes look up, distracted.  ""Aa sou ka.  I should leave a few to take care of things while I'm out--""  Oh, thinking aloud again.

Releasing his hand, Luffy quickly flicks up a finger with the express purpose of... tapping that 'antenna', before spinning around on a sandalled heel and MARCHING in an exaggerated imitation of a soldier, right on out the door.  ""Jaaa naaa,"" singsongs the pirate as he goes, stopping outside the door to toss a hand back to wave.

F*ckin' Hoatzin weirdos.



Hoatzin weirdos, indeed. Holy crap, man.

His little antenna bobbling from the flick, Edward scratches his head, looking back at the pub, and then shrugs. ""One month with a vampire, a week as a kid, and you come back and it seems everything's pretty okay."" 'cept he knows it's not, now. What aren't you telling him, Oilbird? You not telling him because he should keep out? You not telling him because you know no matter what'll happen, you'll go crazy and head down to the warfront anyway, or... is that not anything to do with him? Maybe it's a personal tragedy on the horizon. A loss Luffy can prevent.

Or maybe it's something big, and even the small gods are sending warnings. he just hopes Luffy finds his answers before it's too late. Getting his coat from the hook naer the door, he waves to the pub man, and then heads out the door himself. Maybe he'll ask another priest, of a larger God..."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Come Back Sanji! Luffy Retrieves A Nakama! (Complete Log)"">

The lively lands of Golden Hall. Such a place is full of many interesting things that distract some. Sanji had few things that interested him in this world. One was currently shopping on his dime and using him as a bag rest. The blonde took a huge drag of his cigerette, watching the woman in question who grinned back him, prompting a wave. He couldn't see that this girl just wanted his money...did he ever see it as anything more than him showering a woman with the things she deserved. He finished off his cigerette, wondering what happened to the Straw Hats. Some crazies had told him that death wasn't a permanant thing here...If that were the case there wouldn't be meat. A sad world indeed if that were the case, a thought to lite up another cigarette for.



Hey, at least everyone's not running around as small children anymore!  Spring is finally beginning to show its colors; the pale green of young grass, the kind of saturated blue of a sky that has traded in its downpours for sunshine, the brilliance of spring's first flowers in from gardens and greenhouses.

The Straw Hat Pirates had almost all become children during the 'epidemic' (too strong a word for how much FUN everyone had) of last week and had, with few exceptions, more or less remained with each other.

Luffy had frequently gone out, sometimes to hold vigil over the place where he died in case the mermen came back to life with Arlen, sometimes to go out and hunt for Sanji.

Around now, he was out to look for that Ero-Cook.  This time, he had the intelligence (scant as it is, it does exist) to ask a few women in town if they'd seen the man.

The conversation actually went more along the lines of 'Were you hit on by this funny guy with a mysterious eyebrow?  This tall?  Blonde?  Smokes a lot?', and involved weirding-out a lot of ladies before one of them finally pointed Luffy at the marketplace.

Someone neglected to mention that death's failure to 'stick' applied only to Dreamers.

The woman with Sanji might be more than a LITTLE startled when a disheveled youth wearing a straw hat seems to spring out from nowhere with the single-minded intention of tackling the unfortunate cook.



Sanji looks over to his side,watching the mysterious figure flying at him like some great ape. His eyes brow raises slighty as he sacrefices himself to save the bags from damage, much to the woman's pleasure. He falls back toward the ground, eyeing up at his attacker. It was...Luffy. His eyes widen for a moment until he realizes something. Luffy was dead....Fear strikes him as this fact repeats over and over. He screams as he tries to get away from Zombie!Luffy. ""AH! IT'S THE RAISED FROM THE GRAVE VERSION OF THE MONKEY BOSS! HE'S HERE TO DEVOUR THE MEAT HE DIDN'T GET FROM MY BONES!"" He wouldn't have believed it if he hadn't been seeing here and now. A beast created when a pirate died near the sea. This lost soul blood red body and hair as black as the seasweed from the bottom of the ocean. It devoured the meat from any living person ,tasting by rubbing the victum against its face before ingestion! It traveled through a process not yet understood by science. (For visual purposes, Insert a Luffy with a vampire cape, flying with a aura of math and trying to take a sack of meat.) Sanji had no choice but to struggle,kicking for his life....wait a second. The cook looked to the girl who at this point was staring at the two with a raised brow. Sanji had very little choice struggle before the girl got the wrong idea about him and his undead friend.



What the--

Luffy is NOT a zombie!  Or a vampire!  Or--""Niku?"" mumbles the captain, who had by then managed to weather three of Sanji's frenzied kicks before he was left trying to wheeze for air again. x_x  Oh his poor lungs!  Hey, but YOU SAID IT FIRST.  You said the magic word!

Luffy's stomach growls, audibly, when he blinks up at Sanji, hat askew.  Turns his head, looks up at the girl.  ""...Yo,"" says the captain, raising a hand.

""He's with me.""

What was that about getting the wrong idea?  You're doomed, Luffy is BAD for your style points.  His attention returns to Sanji like the crack of a whip, at which point he starts matching his struggles with grabbing him by the front of the coat and SHAKING VIGOROUSLY.

""YOU IDIOT COOK!  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?!  HOW COULD YOU WALK OFF ON YOUR NAKAMA?!""

....People are giving them a wide berth now.




The chef stares at Luffy with surprise at first but soon this turns to anger as the Captain continues to shake him by the coat. He raises his foot quickly to the Captain's face in attempt to make Luffy drop him. He stares at the captain as he takes a drag of his cigarette. He wasn't at all surprised the idiot was alive...now only pissed. ""OH? WHY DON'T YOU GO OFF AND DIE AGAIN?! JUST SO EVERYONE ELSE CAN WORRY ABOUT YOU,IDIOT! I WAS GOING TO COME BACK TO EVERYONE WHEN I WAS GOOD AND READY."" He finished his screaming by blowing smoke in Luffy's face. ""Tch. You're just a kid. A kid who doesn't understand he just did samething. Only with me, it was a breather. With you, You fell off the world."" 

 Sanji looks to the woman and smiles. ""See I have a new..."" She was with someone else, carrying the bags away from the scene. The cook's head dropped. Damnit, the kid scared off the babe...again. He would never admit the problem lied with himself or the woman in question...only with the third party. ""Tch.""



""Nf!"" is the sound of Luffy's protest to the shoe in his face; Luffy lets go of his coat, in favor of pushing the foot out of his face.  

(( A kid who doesn't understand he just did the same thing. ))

""...You..."" utters the captain lowly, rising to his feet as he grasps at the front of Sanji's coat, eyes hidden by the brim of his straw hat.  Color Monkey D. Luffy -seriously- /pissed off/.  ""I'm gonna hit you once for every day you weren't there for Nami!""  He brings back his hand, ""For Robin!""  Knuckles pop when he curls fingers into a fist.  ""For Vivi!""

(( Only with me, it was a breather. ))

""You do NOT!"" The first strike is aimed for his shoulder.
""TAKE!"" An open-handed smack upside the head.
""A BREATHER!"" A backhand to the other side.
""FROM BEING!"" This time, he shakes him once, where his hand is fisted in the front of his coat.
""A PIRATE!"" he yells, aiming his last punch for his gut.

For how angry Luffy seems, his punches aren't -nearly- as hard as they would be.  Is he pulling his punches?  No matter how infuriated he may be, there are no other people he loves more than his nakama.  So, it's while his fist is still against Sanji's stomach that Luffy adds these next words, voice low and trembling in anger.

""He was going to kill Nami.  Would you stop me from going all out for that?  This isn't the Sanji I know.""



The cook would've found a way out of the punches but knew it was his weakness that caused him to leave. He could not be there for Robin, Nami, or Vivi how he was. He knew this so he took the punches, knowing the idiot was pulling his punches. The kid was sweet but...

Sanji would not back down. He was stubburn in this respect. He pulled away from Luffy after the beat fest was over, glaring at Luffy with one narrowed eye. ""Nami means the world to me and I'm glad you saved her but..."" He took a drag of his cigarette before he drew back his leg and sent it flying toward Luffy's face. He pulled it because he too was a sucker for his friends, even in anger. ""You never die. You never leave us to fight for ourselves without expecting a few of us lose the cause because the person who tied us together is gone. YOU NEVER DIE, YOU IDIOT!"" He took another drag before offering a hand to pull him up should he need it. ""Get up idiot. We're not finished.""



Even if Sanji's pulling his kicks, they're still not something you can take to the face without getting knocked over; Luffy exclaims once in surprise before he goes tumbling into the paving stones.  A fight's broken out in the marketplace!  Neither of them are fighting with evil in their hearts, and as an albeit violent way of expressing themselves, it's like how two old friends will bicker over something and be just fine a few minutes later.

Give them some space, they'll get this out of their system.

Luffy picks himself up, tonguing the corner of his mouth, tasting blood.  ""Dammit, bit my lip,"" mutters the captain, dragging the back of his hand across his mouth while he picks his hat up off the ground, tapping it once against his leg to dust it off before it goes back onto his head with a frown.

""...""  (( You never die. ))

(( Just a little more time, Hoatzin? ))
(( STOP IT, ARLONG! ))

Luffy takes the offered hand, half his face hidden under the brim of his hat.  Until he grins, head bowed.  AND PULLS, hard enough to topple the cook, tip him over with a sandalled foot and sit on the pavement, leaning back against the fallen cook like he were a -couch-, snatching away his cigarette.

""Shut up.  You're so stupid.  We're pirates, we could die at any time.""  The cigarette is considered a moment, and then put in his mouth for a (comically) long drag.

""....""  Luffy collapses into a coughing fit, tears springing to his eyes.  ""AGH.""


(OOC) Sanji says, ""....""
(OOC) Sanji says, ""....""
(OOC) Sanji falls over laughing.
(OOC) Luffy :D



The cook wasn't shocked as he was thrown to the ground. Nor was he surprised when he was sat on since it was common for Luffy. He was surprised when the monkey decided to try his cigarette and managed to give Sanji a nice opening. With this nice little time. ""Oh that's the game you want to play. Now we're getting serious."" He lifted his foot and sent straight at Luffy's rubber rear end with enough force to knock him upward and accross town. He grinned as he lit another cigarette and walked after the flying monkey, blowing a kiss to all the women watching the fight.



Did you just send Luffy flying across town?

Damn it, Sanji.  At least wait until Luffy can breathe!  You fiend!

Luffy doesn't so much fly across town as get kicked through someone's empty marketplace booth and miraculously avoid crashing into any passersby who, by now, have kept as far away from the two pirates as they possibly can.  Fights in the middle of the marketplace are very uncommon.

Picking himself up and out of the pile of wreckage, Luffy stops on his way back to Sanji to pick up his hat, and joins the cook, putting both hands to the suited man's back and PUSHING him along.  What, did you think you could do that and be permitted to look COOL all the way back to the ship!  Wrong, Sanji!

""Ooooi, Sanji!  You have to cook me something when we get back!  I'm starving!  Something with a lot of meat!""

Have to travel to Middleton at some point to recruit Bova.  And try not to get hopelessly lost.  Chopper suggested Nami, since she's our navigator and all.  <lj user=""climatact"">?  Is this something you'd be interested in doing?  We should bring a third along too, if you'd like to come with, but I'd let you choose who comes along, because I'd feel kind of bad for stealing you!

<lj-cut text=""Promethea: Meet Siren"">
Okay, at SOME point I REALLY REALLY REALLY want to travel to Promethea to meet Siren and possibly have the crew help with rebuilding as their Display of Random Teamwork, if the crew is interested.  Doesn't have to happen immediately, but sometime would be nice if people want to do it. :D

Gotta do a talk with Vivi and Nico Robin!  I doubt this will be resolved easily, but Luffy would TRY hard anyway.

"event","Plotness, guys!  After the disappointment of accidentally getting dropped out of the Bluefinger Port plot, there are few things more heartwarming than to know staff's still looking out for you.

I had a chat with Edward, who has a plot idea in mind for us for sometime in the future!

<lj-cut text=""Here's what was discussed!"">

Edward pages: Hey!
Edward pages: question.
You paged Edward with 'Yes? :3'.
Edward pages: I'm considering working up, as ploits go buy, a far-island across the sea-- basiaclly another large landmass, unexploded and ready for hoohah, with a lot of weird plotstuff.
You paged Edward with '!!!'.
You paged Edward with 'Sweeeeet. o_o'.
Edward pages: I'll be working with Moon on it. Would the One Piece cast be interested in making the landing there, sometime int he future? It's probably a couple months off...
You paged Edward with 'ABSOLUTELY.'.
Edward pages: But will have a LOT of neat shit. More raw-dream, since not a lot of 'dreamers' are over there.
Edward pages: It's still got to be sketched out, built and desced, etc.
Edward pages: But I'll definitely swing a plot your way for it when it's done. Just don't quote me for a date. could be 1-3 months.
You paged Edward with 'The crew were on a sea called the Grand Line, where things were in a constant state of flux. Weather changed by the minute, sometimes. Islands in the sky, giant whirlpools, huge sea monsters, etc. So raw dream stuff is right up their alley. :D'.
From afar, Edward ndos. :D I've seen. ;)
Long distance to Edward: Luffy nods! That's awesome! Thanks for thinking of us. :D
From afar, Edward figured you guys would like to the front line for that.

<s>On another note, I <i>really</i> need your input on something.  I've been doing a lot of Luffy's Hoatzin-related stuff (like visions) off-camera because I'm kind of silly and worry about making my cast uncomfortable.  But there are Big Things(TM) happening on the Gameboard so I need to know how much you, my beloved nakama, want to know.</s>

<lj-cut text=""Luffy's latest vision from Hoatzin."">
<s>""Hoatzin's vision is -- well. It's hard to describe; a barrage of violent imagery; colors are red and white, the pale of cold skin and the sprays of fresh and old blood. It smells like rotting meat and smoke. You want to puke, and you want to die, and you want to curl up and cry. Hoatzin cries, too -- big, fat tears, for family is going to suffer and bleed, nakama seperated and torn asunder.

All of this in a bombarding moment of /OW/ that could last ten minutes, or ten hours. Not matter how long it lasted, it felt like /ten years/...""</s>

-Wheel
</lj-cut>

<s>Now, the question is if you guys want me to deal with this on-camera in a scene (and thus understand <i>why</i> Luffy suddenly <i>LATCHES</i> onto you guys for a while) or off-camera, in which you're all kept in the dark, because Luffy doesn't talk about his visions. ._.;

My dilemma is I'm not sure what <i>you</i> all want to know or deal with, or what would be more fun for you guys, because otherwise I'd be cowardly and not RP this out because I'm always awkward about really hardcore scenes like that. x_x;

SO @MAIL ME!  PAGE ME!  AIM ME!  Because I have most fun when YOU guys are having fun.</s>

<b>Edit:</b> Thanks minna! <3  It's totally awesome to have such a supportive cast. :D"

"event","Knives' past catches up with him while he runs into Nojiko during a rainstorm.  In the aftermath, Luffy comes out to investigate gunshots.  Takes place after the Kid TP.

<lj-cut text=""Knives, the Betrayer! Nojiko's Challenge and A Seed of Doubt?"">

It has been a miserable twenty-four hours of the sky thoroughly drenching a recently thawed earth.  It's been raining since late afternoon of the previous day, sometimes in mere drizzles and often in heavier downpours, with periods of an hour or so of foggy, clammy respite.  In fact, it's a lot like it was a few days ago, while everyone was running around as children.

Some planning had of course occurred in the time between now and when Knives had discarded his name for the name of Arlen, when he had left Roc for Griffin Vulture, and met the Grey Aspiran that would accompany him for the rest of his days on the Gameboard.

There are umbrellas in a basket by the door in the common room, should crew members on the Going Merry need to go out on errands or want to risk a walk in the rain rather than put up with the ruckus of a couple of the crew's more rambunctious (and likely BORED) members.

As for Arlen?  When -isn't- he on the move?



Rain is ... damned wierd. Even after being here for a long year, most of it spent in Winterheart setting up a tiny empire, he still found the concept of water falling from the sky in these amounts strangely daunting. It was better than thunderstorms, he supposed. Or the hurricanes he was familiar with, having water get everywhere was less itchy and abrasive than getting windblown sand everywhere. Of course, follows the sour thought, being anywhere near a beach tended to give this unpleasant combination of both.

Thus does the day find Knives attemping very hard to get the sand off of his belongings. It took a good hour to clean his gun, something that normally took about ten minutes, and the thought about the potential damage to delicate mechanisms made him inwardly cringe. As he had been on and off for a while now, he's not too far from the Going Merry, more or less out of sight to keep an eye on things. What those pirates called security was laughable, sooner or later it was going to bite them in the ass and then where would they be?

Lunch would be a good idea. But going to get some would require leaving his tarp tent and going back out into the rain, which he wasn't particularly keen on doing. What an abysmally dull day.



Umbrella...claimed! The ship is still a mild wreck, as if a small gang of kids had recently been in control of it. Ahem. Though Nojiko doesn't leave the Going Merry completely at first. A visit is paid to the orange trees first, one of the fruits plucked from a lower bough. They smell even more fresh in the rain, almost too sweet to eat if such a thing were possible. Noji tosses it up into the air, beyond the protection of her umbrella before catching it again. As she begins the trip down the plank and onto the beach, it gets away from her, rolling the rest of the way down onto the sand. Good thing it's got a peeling. She scoops it back up again, frowning and brushing it clean against her shirt.
 
Boredom. Why else would Nojiko be wandering around in the rain (umbrella or not) and playing with her afternoon snack?



The rain has made visibility out on the open ocean rather -horrible-, really, like a dark stripe of churning water above a wall of gray smoke.  There are things in that water that can't be seen from the shore - perhaps all the better.  Storms always attract darker things, beckoning nightmares.

Some planning had of course occurred.... and Knives' past is catching up with him, like a bloodhound that's had to trace all his meandering steps to find him here.  Do you know how -hard- it is to track a man you've known for killing when he doesn't leave behind convenient trails of corpses?  Honestly, Arlen, you're -slipping-.

For now, there is only the beach, the Going Merry, two people and a tarp.



He'd been too busy to leave a string of dead or dissapeared behind him. Busy doing absolutely nothing besides work on his bond with Desimir, keep an eye on the Straw Hat Idiots, and hunt the occasional undead down and send them to Griffin Vulture for their just dues. A grudge against the whole of humanity that he couldn't even accomplish past occasional lapses and the rare death that sticks isn't much to keep him interested in trying and failing time and again. The past he'd abandoned no longer was of any concern to him. Nor were the band of murderers he'd carefully gathered up and taught, but for the two boys somewhere in the Golden Hall.

There were more important things to think about, like the fact that Nojiko apparently can't get it through her head that going places alone even in the Halls was a phenominally stupid idea. Pulling himself out from under his convenient tarp (and getting soaked a moment later), the Plant shifts to a better location to observe but not yet get any closer than that. ""What part of 'don't go places alone' do you have trouble with?"" Idle, completely casual annoyance.



Two people? Oh, so Nojiko has a guest? Because Arlen certainly -isn't- people. Ah...she just can't resist a chance to hit below the belt, even when she's not consciously aware of it. But she'd expect nothing less of him either. It's a sadistic dance they've been performing, and neither one has been too shy to take the lead.
 
Her footsteps lead her away from the ocean, water seeping into the prints her shoes leave behind. There's nothing to see in that direction but gray. In the direction she's heading, however...
 
A tarp? Who could be living out on the beach like that? And though there could be any number of answers to that question, the sinking feeling in Nojiko's stomach tells her she already knows. Call it women's intuition. She pauses, quirking a brow at his question. ""Don't."" Err...don't what? No, that's her answer. ""That's the part I don't understand...at least from you."" She smirks a bit at her attempt to be a smartass. Take directions from him? She'll do the opposite as much as possible just to spite him. ""Besides, maybe someone like you has a reason to be paranoid, but I don't. It's one of the advantages of -not- being a cold-blooded killer."" What's Nojiko got to fear out there? The rain? The sand? Oooh, she's scared!



Arlen -is- people, to perhaps only one person on the Going Merry, and even if that person has to pound that concept into the Plant's head, so be it.  But that is a different story for a different time.  This one is a story of extremes between the subtle and overt (nothing says your feelings like a bullet fired).  Pretend all you like, Plant, that you don't care about the Straw Hat Pirates, but why are you keeping a vigil?  It's not like you're seeking revenge for being a changed man.

The water churns, the sound of waves masking a splash in deeper water.

Woman and Plant talk, and a dark shape comes a little closer, into the shallows nearer to shore.  Next, a voice, heavily accented, cuts in with deceptive good-humor.  ""He's gotta good point there, little lady.""  Someone - or some/thing/ - is walking out of the water, giving something a shake to empty it of water before securing the cowboy hat back onto his head, adjusting the fedora.  ""....Howdy.""

What have you got to fear?  Only a demihuman tiger shark-turned-cowboy, walking -right- -up- -behind- you, Nojiko.



""You know, one of these days you're going to go wandering around when I'm not here to make sure your skinny ass makes it back to your ship, and you're going to get mutilated. And I'm going to show up and point and laugh at you while you can't do anything but lie there and bleed for being a stupid little human who doesn't know how to listen."" He picks up a rock off the beach and bounces it in his hand idly, watching the rain wash off the sand. ""If you -were- a cold-blooded killer you'd be safer. As it is you're just a squishy target with the sort of victim rays that scream 'I've got friends and family who will AGONIZE over my death! Kill me!', and -real- murderers can pick up on it like blood attracts sharks.""

.... Which was not, he notes absently, a summons for one Corky, who has apparently decided to show up anyway, stepping from the water like a sharp-toothed Poseidon. His expression, one of amused disdain, fades swiftly into a mask of bland neutrality. He recognizes the sharkmera very well, after all he'd -picked- Corky himself for the shark's strength and speed on land or in the water. What he's doing here, Knives didn't know, and didn't particularly care. ""...Corky."" Hello. Shouldn't you be back at Winterheart by now?



The orange in Nojiko's hands is continually tossed and caught, almost mirroring Knives with the rock. Though the more he speaks, the more she starts to grip the fruit, to the point of actually piercing the flesh and causing the juice to trickle along her fingers. It was that 'skinny ass' comment. Since -when- has he noticed her ass, and -where- can she find a stick sharp enough to poke his eyes out for it?
 
Okay, so the sound of an unfamiliar voice approaching from behind brings a look of mild alarm to Nojiko's face in spite of what she just said. The orange is dropped against the sand then, umbrella likewise lowered as she turns to see who it is. ""...Merman."" You can dress 'em up, give them a cute little cowboy hat, nice little accent, but they're still monsters. When Knives actually addresses him by name, Noji's gaze shoots back in the plant's direction. ""Well...I'll just leave you two boys to your little chat."" She attempts to sound cordial. Meanwhile she's taking a step back, a step closer to the Going Merry. Not just for her own safety, but the sharkman attacked them once before. Nojiko wants to warn everyone that he's this close by again.



Winterheart?  He was, for a while.  Until he and the rest of that wonderful menagerie of Knives' discovered that he -wasn't- coming back, and the two brats he so favored hadn't returned either.  Some investigation revealed that the Straw Hat Pirates were still very active, and that there had been sightings of a man that looked like Knives around Golden Hall.

""Knives!"" cheerfully greets the sharkmera, tipping his hat, ""Long time no see, pard.  Ah've been hearin' some disturbin' rumors.""  As for Nojiko?  Over the fact that Corky is now stepping between her and the Going Merry with a shake of his head ('Nah, little lady, y'all're stayin' /right/ here,' he'd muttered, grinning toothily, menacing in spite of his cordial tone)... please, feel free to be alarmed.

""...I heah ye've gone and /betrayed/ us, Knives.  Say it ain't so, pard.  We've been together how long now?""



See, if Nojiko ever actually listened to him this wouldn't be happening. She'd be nicely inside her ship, thinking for all the world that nothing would ever happen to her, and Knives could handle Corky on his own. He certainly won't stop her from retreating towards the ship, though there isn't any outwards reaction at all when the sharkmera steps between Nojiko and the Going Merry. He'd said he'd do what he could, and he'd hold to it. With the pirate woman's escape route blocked, that means he's going to have to play things very carefully to get her away alive and well. By, it seems at the moment, ignoring her completely. ""Well, there's the problem. Knives is dead. Died a while back, sorry you didn't get the memo. I'm sure you'll find yourself someone else willing to pull your strings, but not in this area. Try somewhere else. You might get paid better, too. Goose's are always looking for hired help.""



...Somehow, she'd really known that wouldn't work. But a girl can hope! Her expression turns sour when her 'exit stage right' is blocked. That paired with the muttered words does alarm her, even when Nojiko does her best not to show it.
 
She can't act too rashly. If she tries to scamper off like a scared rabbit the way her instincts and tensed muscles tell her, she'll only make for tantalizing prey just begging to be chased. And inevitably caught. Goddamn that Plant for being right! (There really is a first time for everything, eheh.) For now all she can do is lower her head and concentrate on what she can of their conversation. Maybe they'll say something that's actually useful...if she can only stay alive long enough to relay any such thing to the others.
 
Betrayed? Nojiko fights the urge to glance up at Knives at that. This is all probably just an act orchestrated by him personally to deceive the Straw Hat Pirates. Now who's being paranoid?



Corky?  He only smiles, baring rows of wicked teeth.  ""Much obliged,"" drawls the sharkmera to Nojiko, webbed fingers touching to the brim of his dark fedora.  Thanks for not taking off like a scared rabbit.  That only encourages the predator in him, thankee sai.  ""Not a merman, ma'am.  Boys like me, we be made, not born.""  Chimeras.  Products of forbidden Alchemy performed on living creatures.

Maybe Knives was right.  Victim rays, indeed.  Poor Nojiko.

He shoves at her back, putting a hand on her shoulder so that she always remains in between him and Knives, to act as a living shield.  ""Gotta new friend, Knives?  Ah don't /buy/ that 'dead' shit, an' Ah sure as hell ain't goin' home without your head under mah arm as a lil' present t'take home t'the others.""

""Yer gun.  Toss it here.""



""No friend of mine. That jilly and her ka-tet but one much like you wants me dead."" How cheerfully it's said; that, and Corky's intention, is nothing more than a joke to the lanky alien, and it was doubtful anything was going to change that any time soon. A living shield, if Knives was still the same as ever, would do Corky no good at all - he'd never had any problem shooting through someone before to hit his target. ""You should have known better than to come after me alone. I taught you better than that. Did you go stupid after my death?"" The black magnum is drawn when told to toss it away - but predictably isn't thrown. ""You'll get my gun,"" he says pleasantly, taking aim at sharkmera and Straw Hat Pirate, ""When you pry it from my cold, stiff fingers."" Click. ""And that is not going to happen. I'm sorry, you're going to have to die in my stead.""
Stupid girl. She better run when the opportunity presents itself.



Merman, chimera, potato, potatoh. Nojiko doesn't care. She only knows that looking at Corky reminds her of something evil and -hated-. ""I'm not his friend!"" She hisses venomously, and does begin to put up a struggle against Corky in spite of better judgment. She could call out for help at any time. They could probably hear her back on the ship. But she doesn't want anyone else to die for their first or even second time. ""I don't believe this..."" The only mumbled words she can muster in spite of her fear. She's being used...by a monster...as a human shield against another monster. Bellemerre told her there'd be days like this.
 
""O..oi!"" Noji gasps when the gun is drawn, aimed, and cocked. But the alarm isn't because of the obvious reasons. ""Make sure you don't miss!"" She'll be really pissed if that badass reputation of his only results in a unarmed woman getting shot while the bastard in back survives! That Knives doesn't surrender his gun isn't a surprise to her. You think she'd actually expected him to do that?



""Keh!  I expected no less.""  Corky had hoped that, had that 'dying' nonsense been true, Knives may have gotten soft hanging out with the Straw Hat Idiots, but it seems like Knives' killing instinct is still very much alive.  What a shame.  Well, he's got a hostage, and the fact alone he hasn't fired yet is proof enough that there was a change.  

Struggle as Nojiko might, Corky's pretty strong, and those hands with clamp down on her arms to keep her in front of him when she tries to make it difficult to use her as a living shield.  He lowers his head to the woman's tattooed shoulder, baring his teeth again, threateningly.  ""Ah-ah-ah,"" chides the sharkmera, ""Ah wouldn't do that.  Toss yer GUN, pard, or Ah start snackin' on Lil Miss here.""



He'll miss his intended target. It's something he's already aware is going to happen, whether or not he wants it to - while in his eyes for this insult Corky should die, chances were very good Griffin Vulture would disagree, and landing a killing blow might be prevented by the little god's will instead of his. Knowing, absolutely *knowing* he'll miss when aiming for a vital shot shifts his aim only slightly, the fact that Nojiko's held as some kind of living shield drawing a smirk of disdain from the Plant. ""Hiding behind humans. How pathetic."" The gun is not thrown. The implied threat fails. Maybe there had been a misjudgment somewhere, and Knives really didn't care.

Move, Corky, make a mistake as the Plant finds his target and opens fire just once, intending to put a bullet through those sharkskinned shoulders. The disdain hid sharp apprehension. Nonlethal he could manage, for now. The pain should get Corky to *let go*, and hopefully Nojiko would run. She was a variable in this equation he didn't like, not at all. Especially given she -could- get hurt so easily. And he'd be held responsible. It's still a bluff, even actually opening fire. He'd have to relent if the sharkmera didn't let go, and he'd be at a disadvantage in hand-to-hand combat unless he was very careful.



She has no faith in either of them, and no reason to have any. So she's either gonna be a snack or a target...which of these people does Nojiko want to be? Well, she's been shot before...it hurts, but the knowledge of those teeth so close to her skin make her visibly cringe. Her head dips forward, the drizzling rain weighing her hair down and making a few strands of it stick to her face. It's oddly annoying...so annoying that all she can focus on at that moment is the desire to free a hand and brush it away.
 
For a long moment she appears submissive and resigned to playing a role in this madness. But then her head suddenly jerks up and back, trying to slam it against the monster's face. The human skull is thick, and hers maybe more than most! Though she doesn't expect the action to be enough to allow for escape, maybe it will surprise the chimera enough to give Knives a chance.
 
""What're you just standing there for?!"" And why does she sound so pissed at the Plant for it. ""Shoot him dammit!"" Clean or not...just kill him.



Shoot?  He may have been shot, too, might have had a chance to escape when his hands slipped in favor of clapping a webbed-fingered hand to a wounded shoulder, but it was not to be when Nojiko and Knives simultaneously lash out at their briefly mutual enemy.  Corky yelps in pain when Nojiko headbutts him on the VERY sensitive nose, but at the same time, he jerks her back and a little to the side, which means she's going to wind up feeling the burn of a bullet's near passage grazing her skin.

At least it's not a sharkmera's rows of teeth puncturing her shoulder, eh?  Arlong, he ain't, but his bite would still hurt and do significant damage.  They're built to rip and tear flesh from the bones of their prey.  ""AGH!  Are y'still so stubborn?"" growls Corky, a low and venemous rumble behind Nojiko where he's still trying to keep her protectively in front of him, ""THEN HAVE 'ER!""

She'll be SHOVED at Knives, while he pulls a collapsable metal spear from where it's strapped to his back, snapping it to full length while the blade at the end crackles with sparks.  Hopefully, before Knives can get in another clear shot, he'll come charging in with that electrified spear.



If she /hadn't moved/, the stupid girl --- but what's done is done, and Knives curses when Nojiko's interference costs him the shot he'd intended to cripple the sharkmera, /not/ the pirate. Having Nojiko shoved towards him *does* spoil his chances at getting off an immediate second shot, because now he has to catch her - step forward, stop the headlong stumble (Corky's attacking, getting out of the way of that spear would be a very good idea), and give the poor girl another push /away/ from this situation. ""You're not his target, go!"" She'll catch her balance, she's agile enough. He'll do what he can to make sure Nojiko gets out of Corky's striking range, primarily by putting himself between the sharkmera and the pirate - and much like Corky, he's hardly a small barrier.
Only then will he turn, probably with Corky far too close for comfort, to reaim and attempt to open fire again. But guns are not melee weaponry.




She got her wish! He shot. Unfortunately the bullet was already on its way when Noji cried out and moved so suddenly. And then confusion as Corky was jerking her around. The feeling of hot lead tearing across her skin causes Nojiko to grow suddenly still. (Oh sure, -now- you decide to not move!) Her eyes dilate and a single gasp is torn from her throat as she feels her own blood trickling down her skin.
 
Still feels better than sharkmera teeth. And still better than being a helpless little puppet always at someone else's mercy. Sometimes there's a price to be paid for such stubbornness though.
 
Nojiko winces as she pushed towards Knives, fully expecting to be allowed to fall flat on her face. She would hardly have been angry if she had...at him, anyway.
 
""I'm sorry."" In that brief moment before he pushes her away again, Nojiko whispers her apology to him. Someone call a priest, hell has most certainly frozen over!
 
Nojiko stumbles before looking back over her shoulder at the scene. Now's her chance, why the hell isn't she running?! Well, she's a little in shock...and it has nothing to do with the wound.



There is fortunately a very, very good doctor on the ship not so far away, but repeated gunshots are bound to get someone's attention, if it's not dismissed right off as thunder.  We have the day of rain and storms to thank for -that-.  Corky knows his former boss is brutal in a fight, and so if he plans on leaving here alive with his task completed, he'll have to press whatever slim advantages he has for as long as he can and make this -quick-.

He has -just- enough time to raise his gun when Knives has shoved the wounded Nojiko out of the way of immediate danger before the sharkmera closes in with the electrified spear at the ready.

Ever since fighting the Mugiwara Kaizoku-dan, his bearmera friend, Ursa, has never stopped calling out the names of her attacks.  Fortunately, Corky never got quite that badly 'infected' with what he assumed was the pirate crew's own special brand of insanity-slash-stupidity.

The point of the spear is driven towards Knives' midsection.  Even the slightest grazing will jolt him with electricity, even if he never gets a clean hit in.



Not all humans. Just these ones. The rest could die slow agonizing deaths for all he cared - and most of the Straw Hats too for that matter, so long as it wasn't on his watch. Hatred he still had in endless amounts, but he would hold to his word whether or not other people liked it. Whether or not he himself liked it. And this time, it was as much about protecting himself as making sure Nojiko doesn't wind up shish kabobbed. As he turns to open fire on Corky in a stattaco of gunshots - not one of which will hit anywhere lethal of Knives' ability despite his fervent wish to blow off the sharkmera's head - it puts him in a very bad position. ""Don't just /stand there/! GO!""

Or good, depending on your point of view. Definitely good for the tigershark as electrified spear punches right through heavy half-armor and flesh alike, discharging energy as it goes with agonizing intensity. Knives had never been fond of pain, but bites back a scream into a gurgling rasp, grabbing onto the spear one-handed whether or not it -is- jolting, and wrench it free again and shove it away with strength that matched Corky's easily, reholstering the black gun with unsteady grip. ""Blades, hm.."" It hurt to breathe. If it's all a deception, this is pretty far to go for just a trick, isn't it? But Nojiko was marginally safe and out of the way and he was still between her and his old minion. His body was even without Roc's gifts extremely durable; though wounded more than he cared to let on (how easy to compensate, when you wear red, to hide how much bleeding there is), even that gut-thrust wouldn't kill him.

The skin beneath gloves and sleeves ripples, changing silently, reconfiguring themselves with the tearing of cloth and leather to a set of long serrated blades, fingers hooked razors. The screaming agony from his midsection slowed him down, far more than he liked. But even then he attacks, bringing those strange flesh-borne weapons to bear on whatever part he can strike with brutal efficiency in return. Twitching nerves would cause trouble with a gun, but with blades..




Nojiko should run, and consider herself lucky that she's even able to! (Was it really luck though? Shut up.) Her head jerks back in the direction of the Going Merry. There's safety there. Nakama. She should warn them. She should get help!
 
For him? No one's going to try to help -him-, save for Luffy. And why would she even entertain that thought to begin with? (Again, shut up.) She remains frozen in place and watching, as much to search for answers to her own questions about this...creature she still calls Knives. And she -thinks- she gets her answer to at least one of them. He can feel pain. She knows because she tries to bite her own back the way he does, though not as successfully.
 
When the blades start appearing, that threatens to change everything. Nojiko's not exactly sure what's going on, nor does she want to know. Whatever thought she'd just been giving to the idea that he might not be as different as she'd thought swings right back in the other direction with that. Noji looks away from the scene, her body turning to run away.
 
'...Just so you know. I'm never running from you again.'
 
Wonderful. What a time to remember that promise.




Several rapid-fire shots at close range?  Almost all of them hit their intended target, only a few Corky escapes because there is so little space he needs to dodge at this range.  

...None of these shots hit lethal locations.  Thank you, Griffin Vulture.

Every shot elicits a grunt or cry of pain, every spray of blood carries him further from his easygoing manner and further into a bloodthirsty rage; he lets him rip out the spear and flicks it to the side, preparing for another sideways slash, the blade crackling in the rain--

But the sight of Knives' arm sprouting blades makes him back off almost immediately.  ""D-Damn you!""  You -know- how he is about swords, Knives!  With a swift shake of his head, he takes advantage of the distance his spear gives him by swinging at that bladed arm.  So, does it conduct electricity as well as real metal does?



As well as flesh does, it seems - he doesn't hesitate to swat the spear aside instead of avoiding the nasty jolt of pain that causes and pursue when Corky backs off, a terrible smile crossing his face. He'll follow, attempt to get within that spear's reach, and rip bloody lines across striped sharkskin. ""Poor, poor Corky, taking on someone you -know- you can't beat."" Let the sharkmera think Knives isn't aiming for lethal strikes because he wants to *toy* with him, let him think that the Plant is enjoying this - expression and demeanor both suggest it strongly. Nobody will know by looking at him how much each electric shock hurts, or how much damage had been already done, or how he hoped that if he could force Corky back into the sea, the sharkmera would flee knowing there Knives wouldn't follow. Nojiko finally seemed to have the right idea and was going back to her ship, where her nakama would protect her just fine and dandy and leave the Plant to deal with this on his own. Thus assured she was finally *going*, he can take some of his attention off of her. The bullet-graze shouldn't have been that bad at least. He'll need his energy later when her indignant crewmates came to take out Noji's wound on him.



She isn't going anywhere. Ain't it a bitch? Nojiko's just a spectator at this point. Horrified more than she'll show. Fascinated more than she'll admit. It's similar to watching animals fight to the death, only without the guilt.
 
'He can beat him!' The thought goes through her mind with far more encouragement than she ever wanted to give Knives. But she knows how powerful he must be. That he beat Zoro was just one example of it. If she hadn't been involved, she wonders if this fight wouldn't have been over before it even started.
 
Nojiko glances down to her injury, judging it to not be as serious as she at first feared. She can wait a little longer, can even treat herself. Maybe...she won't even tell them what happened. Maybe she'll think to dangle it over his head like a mouse in front of a cat. But he does have some wicked claws. c.c;
 
She actually takes a step towards them!! That should make him *really* happy. But visibility isn't that great, and being able to hear what Knives is saying is even harder. Noji steps into one of his footprints in the process, for whatever reason glancing down at them. The sea water that fills them certainly looks darker than normal...



Corky can only do so much to parry the multiple blades with the electrified spear, so it's inevitable with as many bullet wounds he has that he'll start slipping up, letting slashes appear on gray sharkskin.  There are few things worse than swords to the sharkmera.  Fire is one of them.  Getting toyed with by a superior combatant is -the- worst, and soon, he starts getting reckless.

Desperate.

Another wild stab for his shoulder and Corky lets go of the spear, the electricity suddenly leaving it as he backpedals right into the surf, bleeding.  Looks like he's going to try to escape.  ""Protect yer precious human friends, pard, yer days're numbered.""  He starts backing up into the churning sea, looking around.  He has to escape--the sea!  He can't follow him there!



He could walk on water if he so chose, swimming however was definitely out of the question. Metal scrapes on pseudometal as the spear strikes flesh again and Knives grasps it with fingers more like his namesake and wrenches it free in a grisly trail of red. The downpour obscures most of the spasmatic twitching from the electrical surge, red clothes hiding most of the damage easily enough. And the smile widens as Corky retreats into the water, following step by step though he never crosses where the waves break. ""Leaving so soon..? It's nearly dinnertime, and you'd make a /wonderful/ entree."" Good, run away, tell everyone he's still alive and perfectly willing as ever to toy with his ex-minions. Fear could keep the sharkmera from considering for too long that despite the mocking viciousness to his words and apparent lack of even being slowed down that he'd been keeping between Menangerie shark and straw hat pirate.

""Tsk. I don't *have* any friends, silly shark, least of all humans. Why don't you come back up here, it's been a long day and I haven't had shark fin soup in /years/."" Nojiko's step forward puts her once more within easy sensing range by the Plant, who seriously considers turning around and hitting her with the no longer electrical spear for not /going away/ like he'd told her at least three times. He was going to have to talk to Luffy about his crew's lack of sense.

...Then again hanging around with Luffy seemed to DO that to people..



Talking smack about the captain?! ...Though his own unique brand of insanity is contagious from time to time. Nojiko's advance comes to a halt once more. There's questions she's still toying with. The answers are worth the risk, even from being clobbered with a spear. Shark fin soup? Something about that causes Nojiko to blink and look in Knives' direction. Does he really eat? She's surprised at that bit of possible information. It seemed such a...normal thing. And he was decidedly abnormal.
 
The fight seems to be coming to an end, but she won't hold her breath until she's sure. She will hold her tongue though...Noji would like nothing more than to cry out that Corky's getting away, that Knives should strike a final blow now. But somehow she gets it that that would only rain more trouble down onto them.
 
Speaking of rain, hasn't it been doing quite a bit of that off and on throughout all of this? They must be soaked. x.x;



Oh, quite soaked, dear Nojiko.  But there hasn't been much time nor room for retrieving and holding onto umbrellas, has there?  Rain and mist make it hard to determine just what is just wet sand gathering dark puddles of oceanwater or what is blood, least of all on a Plant wearing armored clothing of red and white.

There is real fear on the Sharkmera's face now, as none of his swift work seems to have had an effect on the Plant.  The girl - she's noted, remembered, recognized - but only as a member of the pirates they were sent to harm or kill or drive from their dreams.  Those were their orders.  Without their leader, their orders are pointless.

He is only here to wipe out the guy who betrayed them.  She was just a convenient hostage, why was he defending her?  ""....Y'all will see us back heah real soon, mark me,"" growls Corky, before he turns and flees into the ocean.



""I'll bring the stewpot,"" Knives responds, though he never once crosses into the ocean itself. His aim wouldn't be steady enough to shoot the shark, and with Corky well out of melee range even if he -could- do something, it wasn't possible right now. And there he'll stand at the sea's edge, watching until he couldn't -see- the sharkmera anymore then unwinding telepathy to 'listen' until even that was beyond him. The spear is tossed aside only then, to roll in the sand, the blades melting away into nothingness again and leaving perfectly normal arms in their stead, albeit with tattered sleeves and burned skin where electrical shock had hit him. ""Why didn't you go back to your ship?""

Even now he'll do his damnest to hide the raw agony moving was, turn around and face Nojiko with an expression completely devoid of emotion, voice just as flat. In the rain and mist, noting he's far paler than usual wouldn't be easy at all. There would be no weakness shown, even now. ""What would you have done if he decided to use that spear like a javelin and throw it at you? Or if he hadn't decided I was the better target? Go get your arm taken care of."" How long will it be until her angry crewmates come after him?

He doesn't wait for an answer in favor of turning and heading back for his tarp-tent with a painful slowness disguised as an idle stroll, trail stained dark. At least it would be dry under there, if he pulled the rolled up sides down so wind couldn't blow anything in. There had to be a way to get Griffin Vulture to let him shoot those hybrid insects. There had to be.



Her senses aren't nearly as sharp as his, and Nojiko doesn't have the gift of telepathy. So she watches the sea that Corky retreated into long after Knives is satisfied of his retreat. When she does finally look to Knives at his question, she's thankful to see the blades returned to arms. Why she would actually -want- to see him looking so normal again is a difficult question to answer. Remaining as he was would have helped prove the point Nojiko's been trying to make all along.
 
Why didn't you go back to your ship?
 
""I don't know."" Her lips murmur the answer, knowing it'll only be fit for mocking by him. Noji's not satisfied with it herself. She foolishly passed up her chance at escape, and the scenarios he presents had been all too possible. ""I guess...I just wanted....to make sure...you'd be alright."" Man, extracting teeth would've been easier! And less painful for her. Nojiko closes her eyes tightly as he passes by. He didn't save her, she won't think of it that way. At best, he only spared her. Right?
 
""Do you really eat?!"" Where the hell did that question come from? o.o; Maybe he'll spare her again and not answer.



""Of course I'm alright."" Just, you know, bleeding heavily and somewhat dizzy and very very unhappy, not that he'll admit to any of that. A slow pace meant he could move without showing anything at all was wrong, with the rain busily washing evidence away. He'll make it to his tarp soon enough. ""I taught him how to fight. I won't be bested that easily."" It took Luffy one hell of a fight to take him down. Zoro couldn't do it. One sharkmera wouldn't unless he got really lucky, and today wasn't that day.

... does he -eat-? ""Yes. I eat. Two or three times a day if I can help it, though I don't need to. I also take showers, piss, shit, sleep, have dreams and occasionally get hung over."" She didn't know why she didn't run. Knives could guess why. He was the target, after all. If Corky killed him, Corky wouldn't probably bother with hurting her anymore, and she'd be able to fulfill her promise of being the last thing he sees.



""...Ooooi!  Oi!  Who goes there?""

There's a light floating in the mists near the great, shadowy bulk of the Going Merry, and coming closer.  But no estranged will-o-the-wisp this, when the approaching form coalesces into the sillouette of a straw-hatted captain holding a lit lantern.

It's Luffy, investigating after he'd realized that thunder doesn't bang around like that so many times in rapid succession.  He has little to fear from gunshots, so he came out when he realized Nojiko was missing.  Although his manner is nonchalant and curious, the truth is, he's fighting down a tense lump in his throat.  Gunshots, and a missing nakama.

He's relieved when he recognizes Nojiko's figure by the tarp and starts running for it, grinning.  ""Oi!  You okay?  I heard a weird noise and--""  The captain's footsteps stop when he steps in something that...draws his gaze down.  That looks like, with the lamplight, a lot of rain mixing with a footprint filled with something red.  

His head snaps back up, ""Ah?!  Who's hurt?""



Yes! That must've been her reason! Thank you Knives. <3 Nojiko is forced to lower her head if she's to hide her smile at his response. Well...that's a little -too- much information. But he did answer some questions that she didn't have to ask. And in that special way he has with words. He really should write for a greeting card company.
 
""Luffy."" Nojiko blinks and looks in the direction of his voice as soon as she hears it. In spite of Knives' REPEATED warnings, the danger of going out on her own only hits her then. ""I'm alright!"" She waves to the captain, offering him a sheepish grin. ""Sorry if I worried you. Let's go back to the others, ne?"" She half turns, prepared to accompany him back when Luffy asks that question. Blink. ""No one. Really, I'm okay."" She shakes her head to reassure him before her eyes inevitably lower to the footprint. That's not blood from her arm...she's not bleeding that much.
 
""Lying bastard!"" Noji growls before looking towards the tarp, or searching out his form if he hasn't yet made it there. She should've known his words weren't worth anything!




""Yo, Luffy."" Knives settles himself in his (blessedly dry) tent, the cast shadow enough to allow him a wince as he does so, shoulder and abdomen beating a double pulse of agony. ""I shot your nakama again. You might want to get her to a doctor."" There, explanation for the blood, perhaps enough to elicit a vindictive response, and perfectly true to boot. With Luffy here, Nojiko was no longer his responsibility, and Corky wouldn't be back tonight. Not with multiple gunshot wounds, travelling underwater. Blood attracts predators, even when you -are- a predator.

That dancing bit of lanternlight to his eyes lit up the fog and made it difficult to make out much of anything any considerable distance away. Pesky thing. Stupid pirates. He's not a lying bastard, really. He just freely and often omits information on a grand scale.



Luffy puts a hand to his forehead and scrubs dripping bangs out of his eyes, narrowing them against the light of the lantern to peer first at Nojiko, and then at the tarp, under which Knives is sitting.  Woah!  He totally missed him there when he first showed up!  A pause.  ""Oh, if he's okay, then...""  He blinks down at his foot, lifting it from the puddle.  No, that's very obviously ... ""AAAUUUGHH, BLOOD--""  Luffy lifts his head, squinting at the sky.

""...Where'd it come from?  It's not raining it.""  A hand held out to check.  (HONESTLY, Luffy.)

And then Nojiko yells at Knives.  And Knives answers.  ""...../WHAAAT/!?!  YOU SHOT MY NAKAMA?!""  roars a very suddenly -outraged- Captain.

The lantern hits the wet sand, hissing and guttering, and Luffy... launches himself at Knives.  It's only after they've both landed inside the tent and a punch has been delivered that Luffy realizes he's sitting on a man who is bleeding.  A -lot-.  

""....A--Arlen!  Why are you--OI OI!  I DIDN'T EVEN BEAT YOU UP YET!  What's going on?!""



Nojiko can only stare at Knives for a moment. Reason number one...he's obviously injured, though she doesn't have any idea how badly. And the second reason....why does he go out of his way to make it sound worse than it actually was? ""Oi, Luffy! Wait!"" She'll clear it all up! But it's too late for that, as the battle has already begin. Noji sighs, slapping her hand against her forehead. Hopefully the captain won't finish the Plant off. When Luffy asks for the truth, Nojiko frowns and shakes her head firmly. ""He didn't shoot me."" He's just a liar! Sort of. ""Not on purpose at least. It was my own fault. He actually..."" Did a good thing. It was subtle, hidden so well that Nojiko can't appreciate the full extent of it. But there was that moment where he caught her when he could just as easily let her hit the sand. And he could've ripped hell wide open instead of making the fight much closer than it had to be.
 
Freakin' doubts.
 
""I'm going back to the ship."" Finally! He can be rid of her again! ""I'll be back with medical supplies. Think you can hold him down while I patch him up?"" Or not. ""I guess I could also bring him back something to eat while I'm at it."" She of infinite mercy(?) adds before turning away.



Well, that worked like he expected it to, except Luffy *stops* after the first punch leaves his jaw aching, one more hurt among many others. Having the pirate sitting on him wasn't helping much either; thankfully nothing inside that stomach wound besides blood was leaking out. He rubs his jaw with uninjured arm lightly, gingerly. That's going to bruise. ""Nothing's going on. Your crewmate went for a walk in the rain, I shot her, I came back here."" Truth again, with more stuff omitted. ""It's quite simple, really."" Luffy's innocent faith in whatever's said around him was one of the best ways to soothe a bit of the lingering penitence that plagued him.

When she finally decides she IS going to go to the ship, Knives mutters, ""Took long enough,"" but is once more dissapointed as she declares that she's also coming back with medical instruments to torture him with. ""Look, I don't -need- patching up, I'll be /fine/."" In about a week, with lots of rest and enough quiet to redirect his body's energies into healing instead of defensiveness.



He only got one punch in!  The Plant is MUCH tougher than that!  It took LOTS and LOTS of punches to take him down.  ....Lots.  Really. Not an experience Luffy wants to have twice, yeesh.  A hand clamps down on his shoulder, in case Knives gets any bright ideas of sitting up, one fist drawn back in preparation to start smacking the HELL out of him if Nojiko verifies what Knives said.

""....He didn't?""  To Nojiko.  And then, to Knives, ""You did?!""  He gives his head a quick shake, ""WHICH ONE IS IT?!""

""U--Okay,"" Luffy says, blinking at Nojiko.  He'll just, uh, sit here.  That's one way to make sure Knives doesn't move!  He will sit RIGHT HERE and crack his knuckles.  And drip water on him.  Accidentally.

Once she's out of earshot, he lowers eyelids to half-mast and glares.  ""....Arlen.""

""Tell me bullshit to make me hit you again and I'll kick your ass.""  Blink.  

Something about that didn't come out the way he wanted it to.  ""....I mean, or I'll cook you something and make you eat it.""  That, at least, should be a highly unpleasant threat.  :D 



Nojiko doesn't return to the tarp tent immediately. But as injured as Arlen is, he probably won't be going far. Especially not with a rubber pirate captain sitting atop him. <3 When she does return, her arm is treated and wrapped with clean white gauze. It'll heal just fine, but it will leave a scar. She's probably gonna keep that in mind through all this too. Nojiko struggles a little bit as she joins them, returning with what appears to be Chopper's medical bag, a few more supplies in her arms, a bag that has the unmistakable scent of food coming from it, even a blanket and pillow.
 
'I must be losing my mind...'
 
Noji sighs to herself while unfolding a small sterile towel on the ground. Atop it she begins placing all sorts of shiny silver things withdrawn from the bag: scissors, a scalpel, needles, syringes. Oh yes Knives, you're in for good times! ""Ne, this is really quite convenient..."" Nojiko muses with far more lilt to her voice than is necessary. ""I haven't gotten as much practice in as I've wanted to."" She can't use the nakama as guinea pigs, she cares about them!



""There's absolutely nothing wrong with a justified beating,"" Knives points out relentlessly. ""And I -did- shoot her. It'll probably heal wrong too, and leave a mark. If you don't believe me, look at her shoulder if she returns."" Does he doubt that she's actually going to come back? You bet. Why would she, except to taunt him? Which means settling in to endure the pressure of a seventeen year old sitting on him when that -really really hurts-. ""...All threats of feeding me aside, get the hell off of me. I'm not a couch."" Besides, he's bleeding, and Luffy's going to wind up saturated with crimson if he stays there for too long. Eating horrible things is the least of his concerns right now.

But then Nojiko -does- return, much to his vague annoyance and mixed surprise, the things she's carrying along with her eyed warily. This wariness does not visibly rise when she begins setting out sharp, pointy objects, but it *does*. ""You've gotten /no/ practice,"" he growls. ""My physiology is completely different from a human's."" There are similarities, certainly, but nothing in there is quite exact! Like hell he wants some random girl poking around at his injuries, especially when she hates him!




""Mou ii yo.""  Luffy says flatly, though his tone lightens a little when he gets up.  He knows being a pirate means someone will eventually bleed, but he doesn't want to alarm his nakama if he comes back to the ship with blood on his clothes.  ""If it's an accident, say it's an accident!""  Don't tell him things that will make him hit you unnecessarily!  He flexes the fingers of his hand, experimentally.  He'll uh, assume you'll take that first punch as a smack for deceiving him!  By... uh, omitting important details, yes.

""It'll heal right.  We've got the best doctor in the world on our ship.""  And while he might not have any nifty magical abilities that heal instantaneously, his medicines are really the best their world had to offer.  ""Nojiko, I leave him in your hands.""  Luffy grins, turns around, and sits at the entrance to the tent.  Right on Knives' legs.  No kicking when she gets started.




Shhh Knives, let Noji make it all better. ~.~ He's making some good points, but she seems oblivious to them. ""Burn gel..."" She murmurs with a slight frown and searches the medical bag's contents to make sure she brought some with her. He'd better hope she doesn't judge the burns on his arms to be too bad or have gotten sand in them. Otherwise...she'll want to scrub them, eheh.
 
A small, amber colored bottle is removed from the bag as well, while one of the syringes is uncapped and inserted into it. It's filled quickly, the plunger then pushed in until a single tiny droplet appears on the needle and assures that there's no air inside it. Anesthetic is ready and momentarily placed aside.
 
Damn, if she doesn't look like she's having fun!
 
Another glance is taken over everything, and judging it to be ready, Nojiko finishes the preparations with the ominous snap! of putting on rubber gloves.
 
And just when he *thought* it couldn't get any worse... ""Now, let's get you stripped."" Don't worry, she's a professional! <3 And just down to his waist, of course!



Knives grunts when Luffy shifts to sitting on his legs instead, but at least the pressure was off his abdomen, and -that- helped a little. There really isn't much he can do past lie there and wish they'd just go away and leave him the hell alone so he can sulk in peace and heal on his own time without risking the questionable skills of someone who doesn't know what the hell they're doing. ""Look, I don't /need help/. Just ... go swimming or something, and leave me the hell alone."" Especially since he has no idea if he's allergic to any of that stuff Nojiko is pulling out. o_o;

Luffy might have a hard time staying put as Nojiko declares that particularly worrisome sentence, for Knives promptly attempts to escape with remarkable strength, all things considered, sending clean and bloody sand alike skittering. ""Get away from me!"" He doesn't want to be stripped! Of course if he -can- escape, that's certainly going to make things harder on them.



Go swimming or something.

""Can't swim, stupid,"" says a Luffy that -sounds- like he's grinning, though he's currently facing the world outside the tent, hands on his knees while he watches nothing more interesting than the falling rain obscure the bulk of a shadowy Going Merry and a dark, churning stripe that was the sea.  ""I'm a hammer, remember?""  Obviously, he misunderstood.

Once Knives starts struggling, though, Luffy turns around only a little, face obscured.  ""Arlen, I will hurt you more than she could if you don't LAY DOWN."" >_<;



Nojiko looks up in alarm, her eyes widening at Knives' sudden struggle. ""Oi, Luffy!"" She needs help! She moves forward, grabbing at Knives to try and force him back down, all the while being mindful of the burns of electrocution on his arms. The struggle promises to be...energetic no matter what. Even if he were just a human, physically he would be stronger than Nojiko. At least she's got his injured state to her advantage.
 
Oh, and one other little trick up her sleeve. '...Thought it would come to this.' The uncapped needle slides into her hand and is then *thrust* not so gently into his arm. x.x; That's for the scar you've given her! Fortunately she finds a vein on the first try and moves quickly on to emptying the syringe's contents into his blood stream. Enough tranquilizer to make his horse fall to the ground. Noji retreats quickly then, watching him with wide eyes as she puts as much distance as she can between herself and the Plant. He is -not- going to be happy. And it's going to take a few seconds for the stuff to kick in. But when it does, it'll be a lot easier on everyone, promise!



""Fuck you! I have better things to do than get stripped and stabbed by random sea-tarts! Get off me!"" He most certainly does not lay down and behave himself when Luffy yells at him, he's got every intention of -escaping- and /hiding/ until he's mostly healed, which means NOT staying where he is. Threats simply won't work well on someone that intent on getting away, even though it hurts like hell to move. The double weight of Nojiko and Luffy both trying to hold him in place doesn't do much good, though the sharp stab of pain in his arm is unexpected, but its purpose isn't really understood until lethargy begins to set in.

Unfortunately it doesn't knock him out cold in those few seconds it takes to begin working - but it does act as a decent sedative, his frentic efforts at getting away quickly slowed and then outright stilled besides the occasional twitch, eyes glazed. He'd called Desimir more than once for aid in getting away, but the Aspiran declined to aid in favor of letting his bondmate suffer from the dubious ministrations of the Straw Hat Pirates.



The moment Nojiko steps back, Luffy turns around, puts both hands on Knives' shoulders and SHOVES him back down.  Even desperate, the Plant's strength is something he'll have to contest with difficulty until the tranquilizer starts making him sluggish.  Only when he hasn't felt him attempt to sit back up for a few moments does he let go and sit back - this time on the sandy floor, dusting off his hands.  ""..... He's not moving.  What was in that needle?"" o__o;;

Is that one of Chopper's medicines?  Fortunately, he'll keep his questions mostly to himself, while he sits there, completely nonchalant.  Well, this is the guy who just sort of sauntered over while Zoro was getting restitched by Cocoyashi's own doctor and proceeded to carry a conversation with his first mate.  Despite his screaming. 9_9;



""Whew..."" Nojiko only relaxes once the injection starts taking effect, and understandably so! Now she can -finally- get to work on him properly, the stubborn ass. Nojiko kneels down beside Knives' prone form, smearing the burn gel generously over his arms. At the captain's question, Noji glances in his direction and offers a sly smile. ""Happy juice."" Though she really shouldn't describe it that way! But doesn't Knives look happier? Or at least...calmer. ""Don't worry, he's okay.""
 
""Now..."" Nojiko sighs, looking up to Knives' face before moving on to the next task. She really doesn't have any idea of how long the stuff will actually -keep- him like that. At first sign of it losing its effect, she's getting the heck out of dodge! She reaches back for a large pair of sharp scissors, which thankfully aren't for use on his flesh. She begins cutting at his clothing, a much more difficult task than she expected. That must be special material! In the end she cuts and pushes away as much as she can to check him for the injury that's produced so much blood.
 
And she quickly finds it. ""Oh my god...."" Noji murmurs at the first real look at the injury to his midsection. The darkness outside, the color of his clothing, along with his own act did well to keep the full severity of it a secret until now. For the first time she looks uncertain, even intimidated. But she quickly fights that down again, bringing a lantern closer to give her more light. ""Luffy, hand me that bottle!"" She points it out near him, and will use all the antiseptic inside to clean the wound first. Probably more than she needed to use, but Chopper can always pick up more! Hopefully.



Knives for his part lies there, more or less completely out of it. On some level he's aware of what they're doing and isn't very pleased about it, but there isnt' anything he can do, movement simply wasn't possible. It's really unfortunate this particular suit doesn't have a -zipper- else he wouldn't have to worry about having an anyeurism when he wakes up to find half of it flensed open. The stomach wound -is- certainly messy; being stabbed and electrocuted in the same spot tended to cause some rather painful injuries; thankfully the hole in his shoulder is nowhere near vital organs. Thankfully neither wound nor tranquilizer has affected his breathing any, nor has he become any further near dead.



""Happy Juice?  Really?""  Luffy asks, grinning.  That is SO COOL.  He'll have to remember that, just because it has such an interesting name!

Unfortunately, it'll probably result in him saying it at the worst possible time, to the worst possible person, and get completely misunderstood and smacked for it.  But at least it'd be worth a long laugh later, right?

Even LUFFY looks briefly -very- weirded out at the sight of Knives' wound, though he doesn't freak out otherwise, he only looks around for the indicated bottle, fumbles for it, and passes it promptly over, sitting on his hands right after. o__o;  Well, that would be... because he's seen Knives in much worse condition and he survived -that-, and he -definitely- freaked out when Zoro got slashed open by Mihawk, because -that- was one of those Really Scary Moments he doesn't want to see happen again. ._.;

""...""  Luffy adjusts his straw hat and stands up.  ""You can do it, Nojiko.  You've been studying hard.  I'm gonna stand watch outside.""



Ya know, Nojiko didn't even think to look for a zipper on Knives' clothing. c.c; It was cut first, ask questions later! Hopefully she won't do the same if she takes the scalpel in her hands. Placing the empty antiseptic bottle aside, she takes a moment to just...stare down at her glove. Red blood. What did she expect him to have running through his body? Her guess would have been black blood, at least, maybe even acidic.
 
When her gaze shifts back to his wound, she can't help cringing on the inside. Are those his guts? @.@; She isn't really squeamish, but that was one nasty spear the sharkmera had. If it had hit her, she might've been sliced cleanly in half. And no amount of stitches in the world could've fixed that.
 
Nojiko looks up in slight alarm when Luffy announces he's going outside. No matter the situation, it's just reassuring to always have someone from the nakama nearby. But another glance at Knives' face assures her that she'll be okay for the time being, and that she also needs to be concentrating more on her work. ""Ah...Hai."" She nods before taking up a needle and some surgical thread from the tools laid out earlier. It's time for the tedious task of stitching him up, one stitch made before the thread is knotted and broken, repeating the process with the next right beside it. Her eyes are tired before the task is complete, but she moves on to the wound in his shoulder right after. ""Finished."" Nojiko sighs, her eyes glazing over as she wonders how Chopper does it sometimes. She blinks out of her thoughts quickly though, reaching for the blanket to cover him with.




It's not really possible to tell when the sedative wears off and Knives wakes up. Certainly he never moves much past the sorts of twitches one might expect from a half-concious patient, but he's awake nonetheless by the time she finishes. Not a word is said however in favor of attempting to figure out why she'd bothered, and that was requiring quite a bit of thought. The injury wouldn't have killed him unless it went septic, and even if it would have, his dying would have probably been a relief, so why bother trying to help? These thoughts do not mix well with the partial dreams that come with being not quite entirely concious, stirring memories he didn't want to think of. The rhythmic sting of a needle sewing him back up doesn't do anything to stir him out of this reverie, though the cessation of it is a missed pattern that tugs him back into focusing on the here and now instead of maybes and possibilities and whys.

The Plant is aware that Luffy's not there either. He wasn't sure he trusted himself to speak, whether or not his voice would sound cracked and wounded or strangely loud in the quiet under the tarp. Knives wished he could move, test out the stitches she'd put into place and make sure that whatever she'd injected him with wouldn't have lasting unpleasant effects. He'll stay silent for now. And wonder.



Luffy waits almost a full minute before coming back to the tent's entrance after hearing Nojiko's sigh of 'Finished.', soaked to the bone.  He may as well have gone swimming, except rainwater has a tendency to dry off without leaving sea-salt deposits in your hair and on your clothes.  And the fact that he -can't- go swimming, at least not unless he wants to sink to the bottom and stay there until someone fishes him out or he gets -eaten- by something.

Ewww.

""...""  A glance past the dripping brim of a straw hat is sent at Knives, and then to Nojiko.  ""Na, Nojiko.  You should take care of your wound too.  As for him,"" a nod towards Knives, ""Something might come back because of all the blood.""  Some hungry creature, maybe.  ""So I'll stick around and watch until Arlen's able to move.""  A wide grin.  ""Is that okay?""



Nojiko looks over to the door of the tent, summoning a weary smile for the captain. There is a hesitation, but finally she nods. ""Alright."" Hopefully it won't finish Knives off when he hears how easily she takes instruction from Luffy! From him...she never listens. Even after this, who knows if she will. Next time it rains, maybe she should stay on board the Going Merry and just suffer the bordome. Oh, and if the Plant does happen to come up with answers to any of those 'whys?', he should be so kind as to let Nojiko know too.
 
Noji gathers her things together again before getting to her feet. The exhaustion in her own movements is fairly obvious, but nothing a little rest won't cure. ""Make sure he eats something when he wakes up."" She murmurs on her way out of the tent. Maybe she shouldn't have reminded Luffy of the food inside the bag she leaves behind though. o.o;



Yes, listen to Luffy when he makes an idle suggestion, ignore Knives when he's trying to get you to do something that'll potentially save lives. That really boils his water, but there isn't much he can actually -do- about it except lie there, pretend he's still unconcious, and fume. The irritation neatly overrides his blatant confusion over Nojiko stitching him back together, leaving him once more miffed that if she'd just listened to him in the first place he wouldn't be lying here all blood-sticky and hurting. Trading Straw Hat Idiot captain for crewmember is fine by him, he at least understood more or less how Luffy worked. She however was far more frustratingly incomprehensable.

The idea of eating right now is .... not one he's much fond of. So instead he'll work on readjusting the flow of energy through his body and turn it towards healing instead of keeping a watch for pending trouble. Whether or not anything would be attracted by Plant blood, he didn't honestly know, never having actually tried it before. It attracted unicorns, but he assumed that was the whole traditional weakness thing and not the fact that at the time he'd been bleeding heavily.

... Stupid shark. And Nojiko. Maybe she'd think about -listening- next time he tells her to go somewhere.




Nojiko's quick response gets a grateful smile from the captain and a briefly concerned raise of eyebrows.  She really looks -tired-.  ""Oi!"" He calls over his shoulder, pointing at her in a falsely stern tone, ""I am your captain!  I order you to get that taken care of.  And then you better rest, you hear me?""  And no, that was certainly not a muttered, 'Or she'll get upset and that sucks' tacked onto the end there, IT WAS YOUR IMAGINATION.

""...Okay!""  He'll make sure he eats!  ....Wait, you left food?  <_<;  AUGH.  This is going to be SO HARD now that he knows there's food here for him!  .......Luffy sits on his hands. ._.;  No threat of unicorns, they won't come out this close to the sea intentionally, their prey is easiest found in the forests.  Luffy will remain, pretty much just sit here, dripping."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Will It Rain? Will You Become My Nakama?  Zoro, You're So SMALL!"">

A fresh wind, smelling of sea-salt and rain, kicks a battered newspaper across the street.  On it is sign of the current 'epidemic' has been splattered all over it like incriminating evidence; children's drawings in crayons and watercolors.

Somewhere, distantly, a circle of children are singing along to jumprope and down the thoroughfare runs a little train of shouting, laughing kids accompanied by a puppy yapping at their heels.

All in all, it's a spring-like day, a little raw with the threat of rain, but the ground has thawed and there are already little shoots of grass starting to peek up between the cobblestones in particularly sunny parts of Golden Hall, while patches of snow and frost still try to cling to the areas that remain in shadow through most of the day.

Luffy himself couldn't locate his coat, so despite that brown is a very somber color on the pirate, he'd thrown on that long-sleeved shirt because it was warmer than anything else he had handy, but persisted in rolling it up to his elbows nonetheless.  Same old denim shorts, sandals.  Straw hat.  Disheveled, he took to the streets. 

Two hours and a few coins later, he had a steamed bun in his mouth while he finished making a pair of (albeit somewhat crooked) headbands with cat-ears made of paper.  One purple, one orange.  Bought a pair of sunflowers and let them dangle, stems between his fingers, petals facing the ground.  

Walked through Golden Hall, humming.  If it rained?  So what!  He has a little piece of the sun, and had, at some point, run into Nami and gave the little girl the headband with orange ears.  The others were for Nojiko.




          Riding along on Nico Robin's back, the little reindeer doctor peers up at the sky, as the archaeologist hurries on the path. ""... Ooo, we should get an umbrella too, Nico,"" he comments. Clinging tighter to the archaeologist, his chin nestled safely on Nico's shoulder, Chopper sniffs the air briefly. It does smell like rain was about to come on, which leads the young reindeer to remove his hat, place it on Nico's head, and then pull in closer so that they can at least be sheltered from the eventual rain. Hurry, hurry to town! 

          Once in town, though, it is the little doctor who takes a cheerful glee in pointing out to all sorts of nifty things such as food, books, and sight-seeing things. Clothes? Who needs clothes? A trading post is pointed out, and an umbrella bought, and the little reindeer is only too happy now to reclaim his hat. The rim low-set against his brow, the little reindeer holds on to the umbrella, looking around wide-eyed before spying a familiar figure. ""LUFFY! Hey, Nico, it's Luffy!"" he exclaims, wriggling happily and pointing him out to the archaeologist.




Zoro went into town to have a look around, noticing that things have gotten more hectic now that even more people have turned into kids. But he's not here for kiddie stuff. u.u; He was never into that even when he was a kid. Zoro was just too serious about his training to enjoy his own childhood. Instead of buying candy or icecream he bought himself a pair of wooden swords which are carried crossed on his back. Now he feels more like himself again. His real katanas are just too heavy for him to carry around all the time but these practice swords will do just fine until he's back to himself again. When he hears Chopper's voice calling out to Luffy he looks over and starts to head in the direction of his chibi-nakama. ""Yo!""



Orange kitty ears! Nami is tickled pink about that. And she's actually trailing along after Luffy, her pace a light skip. And her route takes her into random circles around Luffy. Little arms swinging, she has a jump rope in her hands. Earlier she'd been playing a little jump rope game, but when she picked up the change in atmospheric pressure, she decided to stop. n.n By this point she's run a few steps ahead of Luffy when she hears Chopper and the others. ""Mya?"" Nekonami pivots around, ""Luffy! Luffy luffy look! HI GUYS!"" Waving her arms mightily! ^>.<^



Luffy is probably the first people would expect to see running around as a little terror--er, /kid/, but truth be told, he's enough of a kid at seventeen, so for ambiguous reasons he had 'grown up' again rather prematurely.  But he's alive, he's walking around unharmed, and currently, he's smiling at the little girl wearing cat-ears, swinging a pair of upside-down sunflowers at his side.  ""...Na?""

And looks ahead.  Chopper already knew he was alive, but as for Zoro and Nico Robin?  He'd kept on missing them each time he was at the ship!  Luffy needs to have better timing on this dying stuff.  Then again, his little introduction to a kiribachi on THIS world was an unscheduled appointment.  Damn walk-ins.  ""...Hahaha!  Minna!""  A few trotting steps forward, and then he slows, eyes widening.

""Robin!  Chopper!  ... ... ... Zoro.""

""You are ....""

Suddenly, Luffy throws himself forward, tumbling to his knees in front of the little swordsman, trying to reach for the green-haired kids shoulders and STARE.  ""....A little Marimo.""  A blink.  ""...K...kawaii...""

Yes, he just called the fierce Demon Swordsman Zoro... 'cute'.  You will never live this down.  In the same moment, though, he turns his head to look up at Robin, grinning.  ""Na, Robin.  Did you eat something funny?""  There's a little something about that expression that didn't seem all that 'right'.  He assumes it's ... um.  Indigestion.  Go, misunderstood intuition!



Zoro hurries over, looking pleased to see Luffy alive again. ""It's good to see you, Captain!"" He pipes in after Robin's greeting. Zoro really was upset at Luffy's death, though he tried his best to hide it and didn't do too well in all occassions. So long as Luffy is back though everything can get back to normal and he's glad for it. When Luffy kneels down in front of him the chibi-swordsman blinks a few times and stares flateyed at Luffy. Did he just call him -cute-?? Oh sure, Zoro's little now but that doesn't make him cute. u.u; Even if he's a runt when compared to other boys his age, he is NOT little! Or cute! Luffy's 'compliment' is responded to with a *whack* over the head with one of Zoro's wooden swords. ""Baka.""



The little reindeer doctor is happy to bring his hoof up to wave at everyone! Which happens to be the hand he holds the umbrella in. ""Oooo! Nami and Zoro too!"" he exclaims, waving even more. Which causes the umbrella to fly open, and lock itself into place. As a result, Chopper and Nico are well-placed for the deluge about to unleash itself within the next minute or so! Clutching the umbrella fiercely, the little reindeer leans over to look at Zoro. ""You too, Zoro?"" he squeaks. ""You're so..."" WHACK. ""... ... ... nothing!""



""Heehee,"" Nami quickly scampers after Luffy to meet up with the others - pauses to point and /giggle/ at Zoro. - and continues to run up and -HUG- Chopper, ""You're so CUTE Chopper!"" <3 He's little and tiny and portable and .. ""Can I ride you?"" *_* Just one quick gallop around town! ""We can pretend I'm a cowgirl, only I ride reindeers, not cows. And look!"" She holds up the jump rope, ""I have a lasso and everything! And we can catch .. um.."" >.> <.< ""ZORO! Be a bad guy and we can catch you!"" :D
 
""Or not.""
 
Her attention quickly shifts back to RObin, however, and she squeals, ""ROBIN-CHAN!"" *Bounce on over to give the other devil fruit woman a HUG, ""Look Look! Look what Luffy made me!"" Pointpoint, ""Aren't they cute! He made some for Nojiko too! Onlythey're not orange."" :D



         Robin arches an eyebrow at Luffy's inquiry, curiousity piqued at his innocent inquiry. Was he able to detect something was wrong by a simple shift in expression? It was to be expected of a man of D. ""No,"" she reassures him, her facesoftening at the word. ""I'm fine."" Nami's suggestion draws a smile on Robin's face and she turns to glance at Chopper. Does he want to be lowered? He might not be able to support even this tiny Nami's weight. But if it's Nami, he might not even have a choice. 

         But before any more words can be exchanged Robin finds herself suddenly pommeled with a sudden hug. What had she done to deserve that? And her eyes quickly turn down to the cat-ears the navigator has accessorized herself with. ""They're quite cute,"" she says, resting a hand on Nami's head.




WHACK.

.....That still won't stop Luffy.  Though he does visibly wince, he instantly tries to grab the LITTLE MARIMO(TM) and SQUEEZE.  And then tuck him under an arm (no, REALLY) as he stands up, whether or not this leads to Zoro flailing.  He can wriggle his way free if he likes.  The sunflowers have been switched to another hand, and these he gestures with, showing them off.  

""I got these!""  They're ...really bright!  Hopefully, he won't get caught in the rain, as it'll likely pull all the petals off.  Whups.  ""We're gonna put them in water at the ship.""  As Nico Robin answers, Luffy's brows quirk a little - perhaps in a quizzical fashion, but not quite crooked enough for skepticism - before he grins.  ""Have you guys seen Sanji or Usopp?""




          Getting pulled down and hugged by chibi-Nami, the little reindeer exclaims happily, ""OKAY!"" It wasn't often he got to play as a reindeer, since he'd usually gotten chased out by his old herd, and bullied by the village children. But with nakama, Chopper was only too willing. He hands off his umbrella and precious hat to Robin, so that they wouldn't get damaged, followed by a big wide grin for the archaeologist and Luffy. ""I'll be back!"" 

          With a quick morph, the diminutive youthened doctor becomes an antlerless fawn, a bit unsteady on his legs. Lowering himself so that Nami can crawl on, he waits patiently, with enough time for the other kids to pet/ruffle/doing whatnot, before staggering back to his feet, and galloping off with Nami! 

          In a short while, he returns, gasping for breath not only because the little girl had dug her heels into his sides without thinking while clinging hard to his neck and reducing his air supply, but he'd discovered that Nami's idea of play involved leaping fences while pretending to rope steer, and just plain flat-out racing wild mustangs. Staggering up to Nico on unsteady legs, he waits for Nami to be pulled off him, and then *poofs* back to his small reindeer/humanoid form, wearily reaches his arms up to be picked up by the archaeologist, and then after a few minutes to catch his breath... he falls asleep, exhausted, slumping over Nico's shoulder. z.z



Zoro eyes Nami when she talks about roping him. That doesn't sound very fun at all to Zoro. That's only fun for Nami! Unless he gets to rope her too or something. Apparantly, despite his effort to make Luffy forget about his small size it didn't quite work. Zoro is grabbed with a yelp and is squeezed by the pirate captain. ""Leggo!"" Luffy can't do this to him like he's a little kid! Luffy's more of a kid than he is, even now! Tucked under an arm, the little swordsman kicks his feet in protest. ""Put me down!"" Kicking a guy made out of rubber isn't much use though and he knows it.



And Nami is grinning from EAR to EAR by the time poor Chopper is too worn out. A little smudged for all the ..reindeer games.. (teehee), Nami had lost her jump rope somewhere along the line (Probably due to the fact that she roped a shopkeep a few minutes ago, and tied him to a tree. If you listen carefully you can hear him swearing.). ""Eheheh! I guess I wore him out! Is he okay?"" Nami rubs behind her head with one hand, footscuffing as she awaits Robin's response. A glance over towards Luffy and Zoro gets a grin from the girl, ""They're silly."" Hehe. But it soon becomes apparent that Chopper isn't the only one exhausted, proven when Nami sinks to her knees, still giggling. ""Heeheehee. That was fun! Ne ne, Robin? You know.. you know.. you know.."" Words starting to get a little slurred as the Namineko starts to grow weary, ""Chopper's.... ~yawn~ really good.. at jumping.."" 
 
~flop~ Yeah. Nami keeled over on her side right there, fast asleep. Kids can sleep anywhere, didn't you know? ^^


         And Robin carefully lowers the reindeer to the ground, taking the umbrella and hat from his hooves. Another crash of thunder provokes a scream from the neighborhood children-gone-adults and Robin turns her eyes skyward, searching . ""I haven't seen them,"" Robin says carefully, punctuating her response with a shake of the head. More specifically, she hasn't seen them since Nami broke the news. But she's not going that up and bring everyone's spirits down. Everyone seems so /happy/ at the moment. 

         And upon the reindeer's return, Robin sets the hat atop his head and pulls him onto her back. Was having a child like this? Most people her age were settled down and had children of their own. She, she still travelled in pursuit of the poneglyph. ""He is fine,"" she reassures Nami with a painfully polite smile. It's only then that the girl falls asleep--right there in the road. ""Miss Navigator..."" Her eyes shift to Luffy; he's the only one who would have the strength and the free limbs to carry the sleeping girl. ""Mr. Captain... do you think you could carry her?"" Another crash of thunder. It won't be long now.



""....Nn?""  Nap time already?  Luffy stoops down - at this point, Zoro can try to escape if he wants, since he's at a lower position where his feet can actually, you know, /touch the ground/.  Alright, yes, he definitely can escape, since he unhooks one arm from around the little swordsman (LITTLE!  SO LITTLE! *>_<* HOW DID HE MANAGE TO GROW SO BIG?!), the better to scoop up the napping girl and drape her against a shoulder.  

For a moment, he looks serious, until he quietly points at the sleeping Nami and sparkles a moment, grinning.  OH GOD SHE IS SO CUTE.  :D :D :D LOOK WHAT I HAVE!

""That's okay,"" he says to Robin, ""I'll find them.""  A grin again, ""And bring them back home!""  Home is, of course, the Going Merry.  Thunder.  ""Is it gonna rain?""  A glance to Zoro.  ""....Hey, I bet you it rains before we get to the Going Merry.""



Zoro puts his feet on the ground and stumbles a bit, then rights himself and looks up at Luffy. He seems a lot taller than Zoro thought he was, but everything seems different now that he's small again. When Luffy mentions the rain he looks up at the clouds, getting a frown over his round face. Hmmm. It does look like it's going to rain. But before they get back to the ship? ""Not before I get there!"" Zoro turns and starts racing down the street to head back to the ship so he doesn't get rained on. :O Hurry up you guys!



         Robin nods at the captain's declaration, but she can't leave yet quite yet; she and Chopper were in town for a reason. ""I have some shopping to do,"" she explains, adjusting the umbrella so it adequately covers her and Chopper. ""I will see you back on the ship."" Chopper needed a new set of clothing, after all. His shorts did not fit properly as is; Robin did not want the Going Merry's doctor getting hurt over an accident involving oversized slacks.



Shopping.  ""A sou ka,"" replies Luffy bluntly, his expression blank.  Then... Zoro's gone!  He'll meet up with him later, it seems, as he's unwilling to go running off after him - not when he's got a sleeping (TINY!  OH MY GOD SO TINY x_x) navigator cradled in one arm.  Wearing... paper cat ears attached to a hairband.  Running off after Zoro will probably jostle Nami awake, so he'll ... invite himself along!

""I'll come too.""  It takes a little shuffling, but soon he'll have the girl cradled in one arm and the stalks of both upside-down sunflowers between the fingers of that hand, leaving the other free to adjust his straw hat.  ""What are you shopping for? ...Something to eat?"" *_*;



         And meanwhile, a Martial Artist is bored. Plots to get some quiet time away from his strange batch of friends have had the deleterious side-effect of leaving him without anything to do, and so he's taken to wandering the streets for a while, to see if maybe he can't scare something up. Boredom is, actually, relatively new to Ranma: the idea that time could pass and that nothing would automatically come along to fill it up is rather new. But here it is.
         And then he turns a corner and spots Luffy and crew. Salvation comes in the oddest forms sometimes. He offers a grin and a wave, dashing over towards them. ""Oi! What're you guys up to?""



         Robin shakes her head. ""Clothes,"" she says, nodding her head in the direction of the sleeping Chopper that rests on her back. For him. ""He needs some that fit properly."" It comes as a surprise to her that Luffy's back already (though they did say the dead came back to life rather quickly), but even moreso that he didn't revert to a child-form, as they had. Very few hadn't fallen prey to the spell that danced its dervish over the city, and it seemed to Robin that Luffy was the only one who were immune to its effects. 

         This was truly the power of those with the name of 'D'. 

         She turns at the sound of Ranma's explanation and heaven let loose a torrent of water, sending the children still in the streets scattering, dismayed cries rising from their lips. She passes the umbrella to Luffy--Chopper's hat will keep him mostly covered from the rain--and her legs carry her swiftly into the nearest shop.



""Shimatta,"" quietly exclaims a suddenly wide-eyed Luffy, who turns his face up towards the sky (getting a raindrop in the eye for his trouble) and then looking down to pull off his hat and place it over the sleeping Nami like a... sorely inadequately sized umbrella.  That is, until Nico Robin offers her umbrella.  It's at the offer that he blinks at her, ""...But--""

His first thought is to refuse, but he has a navigator he'd rather not disturb, so he accepts with a broad smile.  ""Aa, thanks.""  And stands there a moment, listening to the loud percussion of rain drumming on the umbrella, as the archaeologist retreats into the nearby shop.

Luffy looks over at Ranma, who has, assuredly, by now become female in the downpour.  You poor thing.  ""...Oooh, Ranma.  What's up?  Robin's shopping.""



         Ranma, of course, manages to fail to disappoint Luffy's expectations and is, indeed, female now. And sopping wet. ""Oh, I was doin' kinda okay up until about a minute or so ago. I think maybe inside is clever. Wanna come with?"" Without particularly waiting for a response she heads into the store after Robin.



         And how very fortunate of them, because this just happens to be the very shop she and Zoro visited a few days before to get their own change of clothing. And while a great deal of the clothing seems to be sold out (probably due to the suden influx of children running around town), there are plenty of smaller sizes avaliable. Chopper should be happy that he's so tiny; the patterns and styles of the few avaliable larger sizes are hideous at best, blinding at worst. 

         Her eyes wander over the Chopper-sized selections, mentally drawing each and every outfit on the Going Merry's doctor as she examines them. ""Mr. Captain, Mr. Martial-Artist,"" she calls out, finally selecting a pair of red slacks and a white button-up shirt. ""How are these?"" She's not entirely familiar with Chopper's fashion taste, so a little input would certainly be nice. She wouldn't want to get the reindeer something he disliked, after all.



Poor, poor Ranma.  Luffy tears his eyes away from fascinated staring up at the rain drumming on the umbrella to grin again, nodding.  ""Okay.""  He'll let Ranma go on ahead first, and follow after he stands out there a little longer, for nothing better to do than watch the street go gray and shiny with all this falling rain.  ""...Hee.""  This is a ... good town.

He goes to the door of the shop and pulls down the umbrella, leaving it open at the doorway.  He'll pick it up when he leaves, and steps inside just as he's addressed.  Ooh, red.  ""Ii darou!""  That's good to him!  ""I like red!  It's a great color!""  But then, Luffy's fashion sense is like a rating of ... something REALLY LOW.  ""That should work!""



Ranma, meanwhile, actually has fashion sense, though you won't catch her admitting to it. She peers for a moment as she drips on the floor, then shrugs. ""It'll cover him an' keep him warm. Looks good ta me."" She sneezes. Speaking of warm. ""Meh. Stupid rain. So what've you guys been up to, anyway? 'sides shoppin', I mean.""



         Chopper doesn't seem to mind the color, either, seeing as though his shorts are a bright red as well. And with the approval of the others, she decides to make the purchase. The store remains still unattended--as it was earlier in the week--and she slips the appropriate coins on the countertop next to the register. That should cover the cost of the clothing. And it's not long before she joins Luffy and Ranma in the front of the store. She has no response for Ranma; after all, she had come into town with the sole purpose of making this purchase. But somehow, she ended up with a new umbrella and a newly-reincarnated captain, as well. 

         Not that Robin minds. 

         She turns her aqua orbs to the window, eyes follow the rain as it cascades from the heavens. How long had it been since they last had such a downpour? She couldn't recall anything more than minor drizzles during her last month or so here. 

         It's almost as though the sky is crying.



This rain, of course, means that the pirates are going to be more or less confined to the inside of the Going Merry.  

Hopefully, the rain doesn't last long.  As most of the crew know how Luffy gets when he's run out of options to amuse himself with.  Add to that the fact that most of the crew are now exciteable CHILDREN, and you have the makings of a disaster!  ""I died and came back.""

""A--chotto,""  Hold on.  He says, when Nico Robin approaches again, moving past her to look in a basket of umbrellas.  Why?  Well, there's two others here who could probably use them.  He still has a little pocket money.  Don't ask how he makes it when they haven't found treasure or anything - he kind of helps out people with random things, has a great time, and then people give him lunch or a few coins.  It's kind of nifty.

So, he returns with a bright green one with a frog painted on it (this is offered to Ranma, since it 'Matches her hair, Christmas colors, see?') and a lavender one for Nico Robin.  ""Then I was going for a walk looking for the rest of my nakama.  I'd just come back when you and Vivi showed up on the ship, Ranma.""



Ranma blinks. ""You died, Luffy? Sorry ta hear that. Wish I coulda been there ta help're somethin'."" On the other hand, he seems fine now. She accepts the umbrella with a bit of a grin. ""Seems every time I turn my back ta you guys somethin' happens. Not that I'm complainin' particularly. Reminds me of home."" A brief sigh, but not particularly a regretful one. It's waiting for her.



         Working for Crocodile has its advantages; stipends are given to all those individuals working beneath the head of Baroque Works. A few weeks ago she wouldn't have believed it if someone told her that she'd be spending her allowance on an outfit for one of the Straw Hat Pirates. 

         She could barely believe it even now, but here she was, pint-sized polo shirt and slacks in hand. 

         Robin accepts the umbrella with a nod, somehow managing to balance the sleeping Chopper on her back with one arm and an umbrella with the other. 

         ""I have not seen much of her,"" Robin remarks, shifting Chopper's weight on her back. Replace 'much' and 'of' with 'at all', and you've got a sentence that is closer to the truth.



""It's fine, Arlong's not someone people can just easily beat.""  That was curtly said, but don't get him wrong; he's not questioning anyone's abilities, he's just pretty sure the situation was unavoidable - otherwise, Luffy would've grabbed Nami and run like hell.  However, he seems about as nonchalant as Ranma is.  Why would he dwell on it?  He came back, his nakama's safe, and that's all that matters.

Luffy blinks, and walks out to get the umbrella he left by the door, stepping away from the door.  ""Na,"" he abruptly adds, turning his head, ""Miss it?  Your home, I mean.""  You'd think someone would ask such a thing seriously, but he's wearing a bright grin.  He doesn't seem to get bogged down by worries; the few he does have (like about Arlen, the missing Sanji, like about Vivi and Nico Robin's situation, like about a pair of wrinkled maps hidden amongst his things on the ship) come out to play when no one's looking.  c_c;

Speaking of, Nico Robin's answer gets a very quick sideways glance.  ""Mn.""  Awkward silence.  And then a sudden smile!  ""Let's go.""



Ranma nods a little. She bristles somewhat at the 'not easily beat' comment, but understands what Luffy's trying to get across. When Luffy asks about home, she tilts her head somewhat. ""I guess I never told ya about anyathat, did I? I come from a place called Japan. It's not on your world, I think. Anyway... home is weird. I live with my dad an' this one family, an' I'm engaged ta one of the girls there, to join the family schools. An' to this other girl I met when I was a kid, 'cause dad accepted her dowry and then ran off with it. An' there's this other girl who says that we're supposed ta be married 'cause I beat her in combat. An' then there's this girl who I'm not engaged to at all but she doesn't seem to care."" She shudders a bit. ""An' then there's the guys who want ta date me. An' that's just in the romance department.""
         She doesn't sound particularly bitter about it: it's more like she was explaining what she does for a living. ""One idiot who could get lost in a room with one door, one half-blind jerk who wants ta kill me 'cause the girl he likes isn't interested in him an' keeps throwin' herself at me, one dimwitted kendoist... lotsa people. You guys,"" she grins, ""you're a lot like home. Just without a lotta the stupid.""



Luffy means what he said, exactly how he said it.  It took... the help of his nakama and a strength and resolve that came from the memory of his nakama's tears to beat Arlong the first time.  A second time?  It was Hoatzin's gift (( Just a few more minutes. ))  to accomplish the feat at all.  

The straw-hatted captain shakes his head, smiling.  No, Ranma never did mention it, so it's through a rainy street they'll walk, two older, one younger, and two of them with slumbering nakama under their umbrellas.  ""I've never heard of it.  Is it an island on the Grand Line?""  ....  For a moment, he stops, turning to blink at Ranma.  ""...You...""

""...You have more girlfriends than Sanji,"" says Luffy, who is trying VERY hard not to laugh, lest he wake Nami up.  Instead, he just snickers.  ""What a funny life you've got!  Were you all nakama?""



Ranma is about to open her mouth to say something along the lines of 'yeah, right!' but then stops, seeming to think about this for a moment. ""...yeah, I think so. I mean, there's all these times where they were up to somethin' stupid"" koi rod of love, hypnotic dim sum, defective battlesuit, Spring of Twins water, haunted gi, reversal broach, and any number of phony cures, ""an' it's usually me that gets involved. But, yeah. I dunno. There's a lotta times where somethin'd happen'n everybody'd just try an' get it dealt with, y'know?"" She smirks a bit, a trace of her usual impishness but underneath it for a change a sense of genuine serenity. ""Though I'll admit I'm just as happy for a chance ta get away from it all'n focus on what's important, ne?""



A sandaled foot rests about halfway submerged in a puddle, Luffy's broken reflection slowly solidifying when the pool of water falls under the protection of his umbrella.  He'd stopped when he asked his question, and stares at the martial artist for a long moment.  A hand shifts the umbrella to the other shoulder, where it'll still shield Nami from the rain, but frees his hand up for now, at the expense of getting his head wet.

""....I think you,"" says the pirate after that stare, his hair getting plastered to his skull by rain, ""Really do understand 'nakama'.""  Eyes close, shoulders shaking in a quiet chuckle.  ""Yokatta na.""  

That hand comes forward, slowly, until it folds into a fist with only the index finger extended.  To attempt to prod at her forehead.  ""Now the question is... what's this 'important thing' you're focused on, huh?""  What's your dream?  ""What is it you're chasing after?""



Ranma is prodded in the forehead and asked what seems to her to be a very strange question. She looks up at him, the confusion quite apparent on her face. ""Are? My dream?"" She grins suddenly, the usual wolfish grin that seems to accompany her in whatever form she's in. ""To prove that I'm the best. Martial Arts' somethin' I grew up with. It's... it's fun a lotta the time, but there are these times, y'know? When there's somethin' on the line: Akane, another possible cure, whatever. An' it comes down ta me an' whoever I've gotta fight. An'... there's just this rush, y'know, when I win? 'cause it means that I can't lose. If it's got Martial Arts in it, I can do anything.""



""Sou ka,"" says the pirate, turning his face towards the rain with a smile.

To prove that you're the best. 

(( I'll be the best swordsman in the world.  My name will shake the heavens! ))
(( --to find the True History of the world-- ))
(( It really does exist!  I'll find All Blue! ))
(( I'm going to be a brave warrior of the sea! ))
(( Bellemere-san, I'll be a navigator and map the world..! ))
(( --cure even incurable diseases-- ))
(( I want to save my people! ))

He lowers a rain-streaked face to Ranma, his hand spreading open, ""...Ore wa Monkey D. Luffy.  Kaizoku-ou ni naru otoko da!""  I'm Monkey D. Luffy.  The man who will become King of the Pirates!  ""Saotome Ranma... ore no nakama ni naritai ka?""

Do you... want to become my nakama?



Ranma holds out her (presently much smaller) hand and clasps it to Luffy's. ""Hey. It sounds like you're goin' ta have a helluva adventure out there, n' there's no way I'm gonna let you have it without me there, Kaichou. 'sides,"" and here the grin returns, ""with me around you can't lose, right? But yeah. I'd like that. I mean, there's a lot ta this Game, right? An' you guys're definately the good guys.""



Clasped hands shake once and let go.  That seals it, here in this rainy street in a place called Golden Hall.

""...Heehee.""  Kaichou.  And now, that really officially means something.  ""Ou!""  Yeah!  ""I'm warning you, I only have the best nakama!  Give it your all!""  This is more a jibe than anything; he doesn't doubt Ranma will put in her/his best.  ""...We're good pirates.""

As for the 'Game'?  He only grins.  ""C'mon.  Lets get 'Mikan no Ojouchan' somewhere with a lot less water,"" he remarks, pushing wet hair out of his eyes as he adjusts his umbrella, dripping.  Blah rain!


         ""Che. Like you've got anythin' ta worry about from me. Just you lemme figure out how things work on board an' I'll show you what I can do."" At the suggestion of less water, she nods vigorously. ""Wow, that's a great plan. No wonder you're the Kaichou."" She sticks out her tongue teasingly and dashes off. A race it is, then.


A genius, Luffy ain't! ""O-oi!"" And... off she goes! Luffy doesn't chase after - again, he has a passenger he'd rather not wake up. So, he'll just lift the hat off her head to check if she's still asleep, put it back with a chuckle, adjust the umbrella and go strolling off after. It's never a bad time for a walk!"

Ohhhhh my god, ""VIVI-CHAN!"" Nami snaps, almost scolding the princess. The very idea! Nevermind how it looks! er... How -DOES- it look? Still in Luffy's arms? Nami wriggles again, ""MOU!"" Honestly, what was he thinking! ""Why do you keep doing these things, Luffy!"" SIgh -.- 
 
Because it's fun, obviously. And he likes her reactions, apparently. ""Ranma?"" Nami asks then, picking up on the request for hot water, ""What in the world happened to you?"" Hey, if Luffy is going to insist on holding her, there's very little she can do about it -- short of PUMMELING him, and if she did that, he'd probably -drop- her. She'll just wait till he gets tired of carting her around. Which should be soon, now that there's something else to get his attention.



Ranma coughs, still apparently being nuzzled by Vivi. ""Uh, I dunno, actually. I was talkin' ta Vivi an',"" here she blushes, ""returnin' her dress to her, an' then suddenly I was a kid. Dunno why that is at all."" She's still blushing. But then she's got an excuse. ""Anou, Vivi, I don't know if you realized it, but I'm still a guy. I don't wanna wear barrettes're ribbons're anyathat.""



Vivi actually eases off of Ranma a bit, though she keeps a hand on the martial artists hair, petting her lightly, and yeeps to Nami's reaction.. Well, she should have known better, sure, but it still looked sort of... Odd. ^^; Letting the fuss of hot water conveniently go one ear and out the other, she completely boggles to Luffys invitation and very quickly shakes her head now, ""It's all right!"" she quickly replies, and then nods her head in agreement to Ranmas explanation of the situation, ""Is Chopper around? I thought he might have some idea what may have happened,"" she murmurs- Of course Ranma has already suggested they see Robin but... Obviously she wasn't having that. She then awws, nodding to Ranma, ""Don't worry about it then Ranma.."" she replies. She'll just do something a whole lot worse. Sleep with one eye open.



You know, Nami, struggling just reminds him you're there, and keeps Luffy preoccupied with balancing you so he won't drop you onto the deck or something.  Besides, it's kinda fun to see Nami get so flustered.  She's SO FUNNY! :D;  ...Why is she looking at him like that? c_c;;

Why does he keep doing these things?  ""It's fun.""  He needs another reason?  She guessed it in one!  ""....Hey, is that why you're all little?""  So!  You became a kid!  That's.... really COOL.  ""Oi, can I become one too?""  he suddenly asks, quite literally slinging Nami OVER a shoulder so he can point at himself, grinning.

""Does this mean you're sleeping in the girl's room again, Ranma?""



Damn, she should have stayed still. SHe might have been able to slip out of his grip. . . probably not, but still! Nami -sighs- at his response, "".. that's what I figured."" And then she lets out a YOWL as she's slung over Luffy's shoulder, flailing again, ""LUFFY! What do you think I am!"" A bag of tangerines? ... She's not going to say 'a cat'. -.-; Even if that comparison is made to her quite a lot. Particularly by the villagers of Cocoyashi. ""He most certainly is not!"" Ranma's a boy! He'll be sleeping with the other boys, if he stays at all!



Ranma nods ferverently to Nami's declaration. At least he's on the same page with /someone/ here. ""I'm a guy, dangit! I'm sleepin' in the boy's room. An' can someome please get some hot water? This just isn't workin', y'know?"" Somehow, Vivi's reply failed to reassure him at all. Years of dealing with strange people pay off.



Vivi mnnns, twisting her lips a bit, and then takes a moment to ponder what a child Luffy would be like. ... Hmmnn... 
 
 "".. N.. No, I don't think that'd be a very good idea, Luffy,"" she then replies, suddenly seeming a little pale. She finally dismounts Carue, offering to help Ranma down as well and points to herself, ""I'll go make some hot water then and then we can try to resolve things later.. And um.. Luffy-san, you may want to handle Nami a bit more carefully, she is a lady, after all."" ^^; she seems a little unhappy about the bedding arrangements, she surely couldn't convince Nami otherwise, ""Come on Carue, lets go then, shall w-"" 
 And naturally the duck is already on the ground, eyes closed and dozeing peacefully, ""... Who told you to sleep here??"" @@;;



Luffy raises a hand to point towards the double set of stairs leading to the upper half of the deck, where a box-like structure/room is.  That one has the common room/kitchen/steering.  ""There's a sink there.""  And a stove, kettle, source of water...  If there really is no more hot water, he can boil some!  ""Just don't let Sanji catch you using the kitchen.""  Grin. :D  ""Unless you're still a girl.""  Then, you can get away with MURDER and Sanji would still heartbubble at you.

Aww, Nami~ why so frustrated?  Luffy adjusts her on his shoulder a little, snickering.  Comfortable?  No?  He -could- carry you in THAT way, but you'd complain, and he's not sure if it's safe to do so while your shoulder's still hurt.  ""Sure thing, Vivi!""  Handle her like a lady!  Sure!  Thumbs-up! ^_-b

Does he move her?  HAH!  YEAH RIGHT.



By this point, Nami's frustrated fuming has settled into quiet grumbling. -.-; It's not going to last much longer, right? (No, he'll probably just shift her into a -different- position, and tote her along that way ;.;!) ""Don't you have anything better to do?"" Ignore the amusement in that question. She's not amused! Honest! She places both hands against Luffy's back to push herself to the side a little, peering towards Vivi and Ranma, ""Aah, see you later!"" Or sooner, as the case may be. You know, Sanji's gonna kill you if he sees Nami being manhandled like this. :D




""Ja na!"" he shouts at Vivi and Ranma's departure.

Doesn't he have anything better to do? Luffy blinks, then changes her position again, right back across his arms to STARE at her, incredulous. ""BETTER?"" A kind of weirded-out look, like 'Are you for real?!' and he rolls his eyes. Pff. Silly Navigator. 9_9 Yeah. Sanji would probably kick him around the docks. Fish him out of the water if he fell in, and kick some more. But that's because Luffy can handle it. c_c;

""....Hm."" At present? He's going to go plop Nami onto ...Mary's head and turn around and stretch out on the sloping neck of the same figurehead.



Nami squeaks in protest as she's pulled into Luffy's arms again. ""Jeez."" -.-; And at the incredulous look, she -stares- back, ""What?"" WHat's so weird about that question? And she got an eye roll? Well! The nERVE! She actually didn't even know Luffy had started walking again, until she's suddenly plopped onto Mary, ""!"" Er. And looks over her shoulder, legs dangling over the front of Mary's head, to see Luffy stretched out on the figurehead. ""..."" >.< What is your -problem- boy? You're completely insane! :O



No no no. Not insane. Just weird. What makes him crazy is another subject ALTOGETHER.

Yeah, he caught that glance, and by the time she's looked away to ellipse in silence (haha), he shuts his eyes, shoulders shaking in suppressed snickering, flashing the sky a V-sign. >_<v HEE HEE HEE.

""It's a great view there, huh."" o_o He likes that spot for a reason!



Well yeah. Not that she's very -surprised- by his actions. Just a little surprised. After all, she's sitting out here in her -jammies- of all things. Sigh. But he does have a point. "".. Yeah, it is."" Almost as good a view as the crow's nest. She can HEAR YOU LAUGHING! >.< And the only thing that saves you from a -smack- to the head is the fact that this is a fairly precarious spot. u.u



You mean just like he can almost -feel- your aggravation? It's only making him snicker -harder- and well into the audible range of laughter. But he's trying really hard not to! Really! HONEST. Okay, he fails. ""HEE HEE HEE--"" WHAP. Hands go over his mouth, shoulders shaking harder. Ahem. :3 He's fine now, really.

Folding his arms behind his head, he crosses a leg over the other knee, sandal dangling from his toes. o_o ""...Did you draw any maps while I was gone?"" Because he wasn't -really- dead. Nope. Just, um. Hanging out with Hoatzin. Just KINDA dead, which is totally different.



""What's so funny!?"" Nami demands, hearing the laughter. >.< Fume. At the question, she looks over her shoulder. Then away again, ""Aa, but .."" It wasn't as perfect as she generally drew them. Tear stains kind of make the ink run. ""I didn't have a lot of time to devote to it. So I'll have to draw them over tomorrow, I guess."" She muses distantly. Luffy might have been temporarily dead - but it was dead enough for -her-.




""I wanna see 'em.""

Luffy sits up, looking over his shoulder with a grin. ""Come on, I haven't seen what you drew on that paper!"" Show! >_< He and Merry looked at paper for SOOO LOOOONG. ...Okay, well, not as long a time as they spent eating afterwards, but it was a long time to be looking at samples of paper that all looked the same to him! ""Please?""



Nami blinks. ""...what... right now?"" But... ""They're.. not ready."" Besides, there's still evidence of her Being_Upset on those pages! You don't want to see that, do you? ""Can't you wait till I copy them over?"" And destroy the evidence?



The pirate stands up, turning around to face her, with one foot stomping, twice. ""Right now!"" ...Oh yeah, looks like that'd be his Stubborn Look(tm), complete with fists on his hips and set jaw. SIGH. Luffy's like a KID who just won't leave you alone. -_-; ""Mou, Nami!""



He really IS like a kid. Especially one that won't leave her alone. ""................................"" She glances away, down to her bare feet, and then pushes herself up, "".... all right."" Maybe he won't notice. But she -reeeeeeally- didn't want to show him those maps. Why do you have to be so darn stubborn?



Because he's LUFFY. His stubbornness is both one of his most endearing and most infuriating character traits. Or is it a character flaw? Depends on the situation, maybe. But sometimes, it's needed; otherwise, how could he break through the walls people are used to having put up around themselves? Luffy's gesture of victory is to throw his arms over his head. YES! VICTORY! And then steps away from Mary, offering a hand down, since she doesn't exactly have any footwear on.



Yeah, let's see how happy you are when she shows the maps. u_u; She has .. yes, she'll say it.. catlike balance, as she walks down the figurehead and takes LUffy's hand, hopping down to the deck. ""Wait here,"" Right there. Don't budge an inch. .maybe she can try and pass oen of her old maps off as the new one? He would never notice .. right? She starts towards the door - pausse, and turns, ""Get me, Luffy? Stay RIGHT there."" Because she just might change into regular clothing while she's down there, so she isn't -embarassed- again.



""Right here,"" repeats Luffy, who crosses his arms, turns his back on the doorway and mutters under his breath.

Yes, it would be 'Right here, wait right here' repeated over and over, apparently in COMPLETE, STERN concentration.



Ranma, thankfully male, wanders out of the men's sleeping area. He rubs his eyes a bit, yawning. ""Oi. What're you doing, Kaichou?"" Luffy's cool, but good God he's weird sometime. ""You're not plannin' on peeping're anything? 'cause, no offense're anything I'd have ta kick your ass, kid or no.""



""Right."" Nami replies quite firmly. And she SHUTS the door behind her, padding down the steps into the girl's room. SIgh. First things first. Find the maps. Over to her desk she goes, righting the fallen chair as she did so, and rummages in the drawer for a few maps. Taking those out, she straightens them as best she can. Next! Change clothing. So she tugs off her night-shirt; pauses to check the bandage, tightening it. Humming. La la la la. Wait, what's she humming about? o.o Oh well. ""Now where did I put it.."" Oh, there it is. Snagging her shirt.



""Ooh, Ranma.""  Looks like you got changed back -and- had time for a nap.  That's what Luffy would call a great use of one's free time! He greets him with a broad grin, though it's followed by a blank stare and then, an inquisitive cant of his head.  ""Na?""

""Planning on...?""  Blink.  Ting!

He turns around, throws open the door, and rushes downstairs.  Nami!  Nami Nami Nami!  He has a REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION!  LISTEN UP!  ""HEY NAMI!  Am I waiting right up there because I'm planning on - on - uh, what am I planning on doing again?""



Ranma holds his head in his hands. ""...baka. Seriously, what're you doing out here? I don't wanna think that you're harassing those girls're anything like that, okay?"" On second thought... Ranma relaxes. Luffy doesn't seem like the type to do peep or anything like that. That suggests far too much planning and foresight on his part.



Caught in the middle of pulling her shirt on, Nami whips about in surprise when the door BURSTS open. What the HELL!? A shriek rings out from the girl's room, followed by Nami yelling, ""WHAT Is _WRONG_ WIth you!"" So demands the navigator as she pulls her shirt on the rest of the way at a speed that would make Sonic envious. There's a faint -twinge- in her shoulder, but she ignores it, fuming. ""GET OUT!"" She was CHANGING! >.<



It's debateable whether Luffy forgot what he was asking Nami about due to seeing something he shouldn't have.

What's not up to debate is whether or not he'd forgotten it a second later, as he crosses his arms and leans back against the wall, not bothering to look away or even blush or something appropriate like that. o_o  

""But he asked me why I was standing out there and I thought you'd know.""  He points.  Up towards the stairs.  ""...""

""....Nice shirt.""



Ranma groans, running down after BaKaichou. Once there, he covers his eyes with one hand and grabs Luffy's collar with the other one, trying to pull him back up. ""Anou na, did you ever get taught how ta act around women, Luffy?"" Of course. Relationship advice from Saotome Ranma. Naturally.



FFFFFFFUUUUUME. Nami's eyes darken as she looks for something to _THROW_, ""IDIOT! Don't get COMFORTABLE!"" She snaps out. FUME. FUUUUUME. The -NERVE-! ""90,000 beli!"" She adds, just as Ranma is dragging the Captain out. 90,000 beli for barging in on her while she was changing, HMPH. But yes, it /is/ a nice shirt, thank you. n.n She -HUFFS-. HOPEFULLY Ranma will keep LUffy's attention. Hey, maybe he forgot...! Ooh, LUCKY!



""Alee?!  O-oi, 90--gah!""  Leggo of his shirt!  Luffy flails a moment, before he ...stubbornly wraps his arms around part of the rail for the staircase, gritting his teeth.  ""No no no no!"" >_<

""Nami was gonna show me her new maps!""  But rather than accidentally break the rail on the staircase, he lets go and permits Ranma to...drag him out. 6_6  Awwww.


Ranma sighs. ""Ne, Kaichou, have you ever dealt with women before? Like, really dealt with them? 'cause where I come from you probably wouldn't have survived that."" It should be pointed out at this moment that Ranma deems the women he deals with the standard strata of female humanity, and thus is probably not the best source of opinion. ""She's gonna show you the maps, okay? Just, y'know, hang out for a sec, right?"" The tot sits down cross-legged., putting his chin in his hands.



It's a miracle she didn't KILL him. But when Nami finally comes up, it LOOKS like she hasn't a single thing in her hand. Well, she's got her maps rolled up and tucked into the back of her pants, out of sight. Oh wait, no, I'm wrong, she -does- have a map in her hand. But it's not the map she told Luffy she'd bring up. It's an old map - she doesn't know if Luffy would have remembered seeing it or not, but it's worth a shot, right? Once she emerges from her room, she mentally VOWS to lock it (VOOOOOOOWWWWW!!) from that point on. Shaking her head slightly. 90 thousand beli is really not that much!...compared to his total debt to her.



Ever 'dealt' with women before?  Luffy sits on the floor, leaning back on his arms, legs stretched out.  ""Mnnnnn.""  Idea!  ""Oh, yeah, we've got women on board.""  Flat stare.  ""You just met two of them, dummy.""  Pff, duh!  (Uh, Luffy.  Pot, Kettle?)

Just hang out.  ""Okay.""  Fidget.  o_o

And she's back!  He jumps to his feet, as if the last few minutes were completely forgotten.  ""Let me see!""



Ranma stands up, waving to Nami. God, this whole perspective thing is weird. He's used to having to look up at people when he's a girl, but this is different. ""Oi. Sorry about that, Nami-san. I wouldn'tve gone in there if he hadn't. Whatcha got there?""


Nami grins, waving back to Ranma. He's so cute. It's no wonder Vivi was *heart*ing like crazy over him. ""A map."" She answers, handing the old thing over to Luffy, and backing away a few steps. ""It's my dream to make a map of the world.""


MAP!  Luffy makes an excited but wordless exclamation as he unrolls it, holding it a certain way so that the shadow cast by the mast doesn't fall across the map.  He doesn't know how to read maps, truth be told, but he loves looking at them.  Plus, if he looks really closely, he can see all the tiny details she draws in a map.  

SOMETHING's telling him something is fishy and it's not the ocean, but he's not ...paying much attention to his instinct.



Ranma peers, then grins. ""Hey, that's cool. I hope ya get ta do that, Nami-san."" He squints, looking at the map. Ranma is, at best, semi-literate anyway, so mostly what he's seeing is 'wow, that's cool'. But he's obviously impressed, at any rate. ""How long does it take you to make things like that?""



Another step backwards. Casual-like. ""It depends on how big the area I've surveyed is. A couple of hours, usually, if I don't get interrupted."" She puts all of her heart into drawing her maps, after all. She casts a glance over her shoulder briefly, and then looks back to Luffy and Ranma, ""Just be careful with that Luffy."" She still has to copy it onto the -nice- paper.



Luffy looks up from the map with a slightly confused expression, something that appears to be an expression he's gradually working his way through.  Something really feels a little off.  Maybe he ate something a little weird. -_o  He rolls up the map (carefully, he's very careful of the objects of his nakama's dreams) and taps it lightly against his other palm.  ""Nnhhh.""



Ranma shakes his head. ""Please tell me that you don't actually do the navigation when this thing sails off, right?"" Please, God, let this ship be steered by someone sane. Of course, Ranma doesn't really understand how any of it operates, so it's all Chinese to him anyway. ""Oi. When are you guys leaving next, anyway?""



Nami points, ""That small cluster of islands off the starboard. I took the waver out a few days ago --"" Er. Glad for Ranma's question, Nami chuckles, ""I'm the navigator, Ranma, not Luffy."" Luffy's the Captain! As for when they leave next, ""Ah, not for a while. We'll be heading for the Ruined Cresent when we do leave, though.""



At 'Navigation', Luffy just slooowly points towards Nami.  That'd be -her- job.  ""I'm the captain.  I send people flying.""  Fist brandish.  ""And stretch.""  Yep, those are his jobs.  Kicking ass and stretching.  ""Right!  We're here until we're finished preparing!""  Even though he'd love to leave right now!  But, uh, they can't leave yet. c_c;



Ranma nodnods, thinking. ""Uhm. That's cool. Only, well, think maybe I could go with you guys sometime? I mean, it all sounds kinda cool, really, an' I don't even mind the fact that we're surrounded on all sides by the stuff that,"" and here the skies, cloudy with scattered humor, choose to provide a demonstration, ""...do this."" She sighs, shaking her head. ""But seriously, this all seems really cool.""



The wind picks up a little, causing the map behind her to ruffle a bit. She puts a hand behind her. You heard nothing. And .. then Ranma gets rained on. o_o ""Ah... would you like me to get some hot water?"" Or should she not even BOTHER? :D chuckle. ""It's up to the Captain."" Nami answers, regarding whether Ranma can come or not. The final decision is always up to him - otherwise Nami and the others would never have let Robin on board, way back when. But she's rather glad they had, now.

""......."" Luffy looks up for a moment, frowning. Holy shit. Did it really just selectively rain on Ranma? Boy, the sky really HATES you! :D; ""....I've decided!"" What? What?! ""While Ranma's travelling with us, we'll always have a pot of water on the stove."" Solemn nod. At least, until his ear twitches at the rustling paper and he ..../looks/ at Nami. -_o ""What was that?""



Ranma grins, ""So that's a yes, then?"" Her face lights up. ""Cool! I mean, well, as soon as this all wears off. I dunno how much help I'll be like this, but it's bound to go away, or we'll just figure out how ta undo it, right?"" Ranma, ever the optomist. Or at least someone who's been through too much weirdness to believe that it'll last. ""An' yeah, hot water'd be cool."" She shudders, ""I don't wanna risk Vivi seein' me like this. Is she always like that?""



Nami clasps her hands in front of her. ""...w..what was what?"" She didn't hear anything! Glancing at Ranma, Nami ehehs, ""It's the first time I've seen her quite like that, actually."" She chuckles quietly. Though it is tempting to conveniently not have hot water, just to see how Vivi will react. ""Sure, I'll get it right now,"" the hot water, that is.
 
Of course, the cursed fates conspire against her. She stiffens for a second, looking towards the east. ""The wind is-"" She narrows her eyes slighty. And that's when the wind hits, leaving her to move her hand from her back (bad move!) to her face, shielding it against the sudden gust. 
 
YOINK! So laughs the wind, as the paper tears free from where the map had been tucked. Nami's instint is 'SAVE THE MAP!' rather than 'OHCRAP he'll see!' as she jerks around, swiping -- missing!



""Na?"" There goes that serious expression Nami gets every time she's sensing a change in the weather; it makes Luffy glance around too, only for movement caught in the corner of his eye drag his attention back around again.

...Map.

""Switch!"" calls Luffy, throwing the rolled-up map towards Ranma, while he stretches out an arm (literally) to... pluck that map right out of the air and pull it back to him, unrolling it as he hops up onto the rail at the side of the boat. Just in case Nami tries to run over and grab it! ""Oooooh, hiding this?"" laughs Luffy, who spins on a heel (you'd think he wouldn't do such stunts when a loss of balance would send him off into the deep blue)...

And sits down on the rail, back to them. ""....."" Ooh.



Ranma accepts the map, clutching it carefully. She blinks, staring as Luffy stretches out to grab the map. No matter how often she sees that, it's still weird. ""Wait. So there were two maps?"" Ah, Ranma. Easily confused. ""Were you gonna show us this one later, Nami-san?""



Ranma's question gets Nami to glance at her uneasily. ""....Uh -- later..yeah."" Uh.. yeah, but MUCH later. Nami glances from Ranma to Luffy - decides to let Ranma hang onto one of the maps for now, in an attempt to get her other maps back. Unhand those parchments post haste! 
 
""Hey! Give those back! They're not finished!"" There are two, both clipped together, both unfinished maps of some uncharged (until now) island. Nami's stomach drops into her feet for a second when she sees Luffy grab the maps. She remembers all too clearly. (( Staring at the blank sheet, ink dropping onto the paper as she tried to think clearly enough to draw something. Pen touches paper, a hand shakes. the pen snaps, creating a black 'sea' of ink on the paper. It's blotted clean. ))
 
""Luffy!"" Give it! The second page is obviously a second attempt, lines drawn straight, an island started to be detailed. Only the lines start to blur together, damp spots marring the paper here and there. (( Nami placing the pen aside in frustration, CRUMPLING the paper and pressing it against her face. Realizing far too late what she'd done, and smoothing it again. It can still be salvaged! ))



""......""  Luffy's feet are swinging slightly over the sea, wind tugging on the edge of both maps, as if it wanted to take back what he stole from it.  It isn't like there's any undue tension in his shoulders, or a change in his position that would suggest anything unpleasant.  Just a guy sitting on a rail of a ship that's his home on the water, looking at a couple of maps drawn by his navigator.

""......""  (( Give those back! ))  ""No.""  Sanji would give him such a yelling-at if he heard him refuse a lady anything they asked for.  (( They're not finished! ))  He rolls them up and stuffs them under his hat.  ""I think they are.  So I'm gonna keep 'em.""

Why on earth would he want a couple of damaged maps?

He swings his legs over the rail, turning around, keeping a hand on the top of his hat, lest anyone try to snatch them back.  ""They're maps of something I don't get to see much.""



Ranma blinks, tilting her head slightly. Something tells her that she's missing something here, something important, but for the life of her she couldn't guess what it was. ""Ne, Kaichou, if she says that they're unfinished, you should probably give 'em back to her. What're they of anyway, Nami-san?"" Maybe they're for a treasure she buried or something. Seems like the kind of thing she'd do. Isn't that a pirate tradition anyway?



Why do you think she didn't want to show them! They're not even CLOSE to being finished. She should burn them. (( No. )) No? /NO/? ""Luffy! That isn't funny! Give them back!"" She steps closer, reache- Augh, now he's hiding them under his hat? ""How can you say they are?"" Come on Ranma, help her out over here! 
 
Nami glances over to Ranma. Buried treasure? Why would she do something insane like that? Leaving treasure where anyone can just find it? HA! Not this pirate! ""Just some islands,"" she answers softly, looking more than a little troubled. Shooting Luffy a somewhat irritated glance, ""Stop fooling around, Luffy, You-"" (( They're maps of something I don't get to see much. )) "".........."" Is that such a horrible thing? She should have burned them. For a second, she's at a loss for words. The desire to get angry and -DEMAND- her maps back caught in her throat, so she clenches her fists and turns her back on Luffy instead. Count to Ten. ""It's not anything important, Ranma. I should have burned them when I made the mistakes in the first place, but I thought I'd be able to fix them."" Fix it so that the 'mistakes' no longer existed.



If there's one thing Ranma will be learning soon, it's that Luffy makes decisions that don't always make a lot of logical sense.  His logic is something you have to look sideways through a mirror and likely while -drunk- or high on something to understand clearly.  He's very simpleminded, which means he tends to deal with things gracelessly, bluntly, and will often wind up hitting the heart of a very personal point.

It defies definition.

Which is why it'll be completely understandable if Ranma is more than a little put off when Luffy wheels around to pin a perhaps uncharacteristically (for someone who has only seen him in his less-than-serious moments) intense look to Nami.

""Fix...?""  (( It's not anything important-- ))  ""YOU WON'T BE BURNING THESE.""  (( --mistakes-- ))  ""You're NOT A MISTAKE.""  He turns and storms towards Mary, the ram-like figurehead of the ship.



It's -rare- that she sees Luffy -that- angry. Rarer still to have it directed at -her-. Nami jerks back in surprise, almost as if it were a physical blow, that intense look. (( YOU WON'T BE BURNING THESE. )) ""Luffy.."" She... hadn't meant that -she- was a mistake. Just that.. 
 
Nami lets out a silent breath, watching Luffy storm over to the figurehead with the maps she'd tried to hide. Maps to a part of her she kept tightly locked away, protected against the prying eyes of others, behind one of the many masks she wears. And now he had evidence to the contrary. ""......."" 
 
Glancing to Ranma, Nami's smile softens a little at his wording. ""...what would I learn?"" (( You'd just be retracin' your steps anyway. )) What's wrong with retracing her steps? To erase things she would rather not have known? "".. Let's get you that hot water, okay?"" She reaches out with a hand to tap Ranma on the head lightly, casting a glance over her shoulder worriedly, towards Luffy, before she strolls on up to the kitchen.



Nami, you may not have said it, but in that funny line of logic that is characteristically Luffy's...  Perhaps that's his own fault, a mistranslation.  Or maybe he's read into those pen marks deeper than Nami expected.  

He can hear their departure, and for a moment, both hands grip the brim of his hat and pull it down tight.

""Nami,"" is only barely audible by the time she's reached the door.

(( They're maps of something I don't get to see much. ))  ""I'm sorry.  It's selfish.  I wanna keep these maps.  I don't want them to get burned.""  (( I want him to have something to live for. )) ""These maps, are they...?""



It's only after she ushers Ranma through the door that Nami hears the barely audible murmur of her name. She doesn't answer for a moment. Though when she speaks, she may or may not be heard, her voice is so low. She turns around, hands resting on the railing. ""......why?"" She murmurs quietly. ""Why is that so important? I told you they weren't finished."" At the question that trails off, Nami lifts her head, ""..are they what, Luffy?""



Luffy's familiar with the feeling that he can't find exactly the right word for the concept in his head; familiar with it like some people are familiar with their favorite pair of shoes.  He usually pushes through and fumbles with words until he either stumbles upon it or leaves it alone for a while, nudges it with a toe now and then, and then realizes what to call it at some of the most oddly inappropriate times.

What is completely alien is having a concept with a name, but addressing it directly is ...admittedly, rather uncomfortable.

Which might be why he's grasping his hat's brim down over his eyes, why he's pulling on it until he can hear the maps rolled up inside it crinkling.  He shakes his head.  ""These maps are,""  AUGH.  If he could just spit the words out like a bite of bad food he could be done with it.

""Nami's...""

His back still facing Nami, he lifts a hand.  One finger.  Four strokes in the air, and after each one he closes his fist so there's no mistake where each one starts and ends.




(( Nami's... )) A gesture. 
 
Fingers tighten on the railing, a breathe sucked in in shock. That the ..rather astute observation has been made. Really, it was no huge surprise. She'd always poured her heart into making her maps, as much as Zoro put his heart into his training, or Sanji into his cooking.. Etcetera, etcetera. She runs her thumb against the railing, tracing a line with her fingernail. Denial is the first to raise it's head. ""Don't be ridiculous. It's just a map - a map that I made a mistake on. That's all."" 

Apathy is soon to follow, on the heels of embarassment that her feelings could be laid bare by just two ruined maps. ""...so what if ... they are anyway?"" Embarassment sets the catalyst for anger, frustration, ""What'd you have to go and look at them for anyway! I told you they weren't finished didn't I? I TOLD YOU!"" And he had to see her most private of thoughts. But she really isn't surprised, and that's probably why she -sighs-. They are nakama. They've been through a lot together, her, Usopp, Luffy, Zoro, and Chopper. She hadn't touched her maps after Zoro died either - that was why she'd been behind for the longest time. But habits are hard to break, and the urge - desire - to hide behind the safety of her masks was a siren's call she found hard to ignore.
 
In that, she's probably as maddening as Luffy is, with his stubbornness.



Those masks?  They're a part of Nami.  They can be accepted, acknowledged in this way...

But they can also be the source of a lot of frustration.

Which is why Luffy does a few things in succession.  The first is an urge like Nami's denial, when he tries to put his hands up to his ears to block them.  The second is when his arms drop to his sides.  It's almost a perfectly identical cycle, except translated in Luffy's own language.  The third is when he wheels around, grimacing.

""STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!""  A foot stomp for each one.

""......"" A snort of frustration, and then he stands there, all small flinches where he's trying to decide if he's really angry at -Nami-, or if it's just misdirected.  ""Ngghhhhh.""  (( Be frustrating when it's more convenient! ))  ""GAH!""  (( I forgot to ask what I meant to! Oops. ))

""....I'm STILL keeping them!""  he barks stubbornly.



It would almost be funny, to see the near-identical cycle in action. Nami would probably be slightly amused with it, had she not been so ... frustrated. (( STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT! )) Foot stomps punctuate each one. And what do you know; she does stop, though she grips the railing tight enough to make her knuckles go white. Poor Luffy. He's -never- going to remember to ask what he meant to ask ^^
 
(( I'm STILL keeping them! )) Nami throws her arms upwards with a sigh, ""Go ahead! Keep them!"" It's not like she cares. Not like she can -stop- him. They're under his hat! So now he has both her Note and her maps. And the like might seem like just trash to anyone else. Nami only shakes her head and walks over to stand at her usual spot by the railing. Hmph! She's not going to argue about this. She's annoyed that he's seen as much as he has, but there's not a lot she can do about it. 
 
Short of stealing them back. And -THAT- is a line, that Nami will absolutely -NOT- cross.



Sure Nami cares!  ...The navigator wouldn't waste the effort on hiding them otherwise.  Don't you only hide treasures?  And you love mikan and money more than anything, you said.  More than anything, until you wrote letters with half-finished sentiments crossed out to near illegibility, until you left them behind when you died that first time and everyone thought it was the last they'd ever see of you.

""FINE!  I WILL!""  And now Luffy's getting the distinct feeling that he's just -standing here- because he doesn't want to be the first to walk away.  It erodes away his frown, at least.

They might be trash to anyone else, but they're important to him.  She made these with her own pen, things she hoped would be lost or destroyed eventually or made more proper, more consistent with her masks.  Mistakes. Fix.

""......""



Darn it, don't use her logic against her! Nami is all too aware that she cares. And that's what bothers her. After eight years of -not- caring about anyone but herself and her hometown, these people reminded her what it was like to have friends. And what it was like to feel fear for their safety. Fear of losing them. She does -NOT- want to go through that again. (( Fine! I will! )) It's almost childish, the way he stays and shouts after her. And yet she's tempted to yell back, GOOD, Go ahead! for some irrational reason.
 
She turns her gaze towards the water. Luffy didn't have to be the first to walk away! Nami would! ...granted she didn't walk very -FAR-, and granted, she's got the most disturbing urge to say -SOMETHING-. ""Luffy.."" Urr. Okay yeah, she -was- going to say something, but apparently, aliens stole away her train of thought. So she just stares at the water silently. Maybe her silence can be taken as an apology?... or maybe not.



Yes.  It's childish.  Just about all of it is, on Luffy's end.  From the storming off to the inability to say just what he means, from the stomping and raving and stubbornness.  It goes to show that insight can come in the oddest of packages.

He'd ... really like to just be mad.  When you're pissed off enough, everything spikes crystal clear.  But when you're that mad, it's hard to be honest enough with yourself if you're angry at the wrong person or the wrong thing.  Besides, there's that.... nagging feeling that he's the only one in class who isn't Getting It, and everyone's waiting.  He hates that.

Except there's just two people here.  That's it.  The whole class.

""........""  He's shoved his hands in his pockets by now, wrist-deep, fingers curled into unseen, white-knuckled fists.  A sandalled foot kicks at... nothing.  It's like picking at imaginary lint on your jeans, observing the navigator sullenly out of the corner of his eye.  

He's not walking away first!  But he is taking a very, very round-about stroll-slash-shuffle until he's sidled over to where Nami is, only to... kick the side of the boat where the rail is.  Thump.  ""Nhh.""

Let's try this again.  ""...Na.""



In spite of that, Luffy is prone to startling bursts of clarity. Really, she'd kind of expected Luffy to stay where he was, or at least sulk somewhere. So lost in thought is she, that she almost doesn't even notice when Luffy comes up beside her, save for the sound of the thump. She jumps slightly, and looks towards the Captain - then away again, shifting uncomfortably. Just two words! Two little words! 'I'm sorry' 'Gomen ne' '50% sale!' -- oh wait, not that one. ""Ne --"" (( ...Na. )) 
 
... Okay. You first.



He's burning through his clarity quota.  If Luffy seems to be particularly -stupid- for the next few days, he's making up for all the insight and instinct he's been exercising lately.

""You,"" Omae.  ""Drive me up the wall!""  Kicking the wall.  ""You make me wanna laugh,"" Kick.  ""Wanna yell,"" KICK. ""Dance.  It's STUPID.  Be frustrating when it's not so frustrating!""

And then, he drops.

More like, drops to the floor to sit, only to hook an arm around one of the navigator's knees with a small, annoyed snort, head down.  

""........Nnh.""

""Gomen.""



You know, you probably shouldn't kick the wall like that. What if it gets damaged! Usopp'll have your head! :O ""I drive /you/ up a-"" ......wall...
 
The incredulous tone falters slightly as she just -blinks-. Laugh, yell, and dance? Yes, it is stupid. And Nami has the incredible urge to -thwap- him and DEMAND that he make -sense-, when he just.. drops.
 
And hooks an arm around one of her knees. o O ( .. I don't get you. You're not like any pirate I ever knew, that's for certain. ) She leans on the railing, resting her chin on her hand, thoughtful. As much as she'd like to step away, she doesn't. She just stays perfectly still. She supposes that this was another one of Luffy's means of expressing himself. He defied everything she had ever learned about pirates. And she was glad for it. ""Ne. . . .you can keep the maps."" She affirms quietly... and then a pause.
 
""... for fifteen thousand beli.."" Still a longer pause. ""... you can owe me.""



If Nami had lifted off his hat to take back the maps, he wouldn't have stopped her, right then.

But she didn't, and when she affirms this aloud, the motion can be felt, if not seen; he lifts his head, blinking.  "".....""

(( But I'm bad at math. ))
(( You can't put price on nakama. ))

He won't get a better deal anywhere.  ""Sold,"" says the pirate with a grin, unhooking his arm from around her leg to stand up, and after a pause, reach for her hand.

To turn its palm towards him and smack it once, lightly.  Highfive.




She's gotten soft since traveling with them. Any other time, any other pirate, she wouldn't have hesitated. And as much as she enjoys getting her friends to owe her money, there is an invisible line she will never cross. Much like Luffy will never cross that line into her tangerine trees. It's an unspoken agreement.
 
Still, she's rather surprised he agrees so quickly - and easily. He doesn't have to reach for her hand this time though, for once he's on his feet, Nami shifts to prop her chin against her opposite hand - so that the hand closest to Luffy lifts, palm up. Highfive, right back at you, grinning the entire time.




You were waiting.

Not long, he hopes.

But it surprises a chuckle out of Luffy, whose brows lift briefly when he pulls back his hand, takes a step back, a second, a third. Grinning when he spins on a sandalled heel and starts marching away. Stops with a foot in the air. Walks backwards until he can lean against that same rail, suddenly giving the navigator a sideways glance. ""...Say...""

""Weren't YOU sleeping?"" e_e ""........"" GUESS WHAT TIME IT IS. Time to go back there, apparently, when he attempts to (sorry!) seize her and stalk back to the door. If he's successful, you can guess easily what happens next. He'll march all the way down for the express purpose of dumping her back off onto her bed. ""Orders from your captain! You should sleep more!""

Nevermind that it's his fault she was interrupted in said efforts to sleep.



No, not long. But she could have waited as long as she needed to. If she can endure eight years, and be ready to endure eight more, until she had 100 million beli to buy Cocoyashi back, just a few minutes more was a drop in the bucket.She grins in quiet amusement at the startled chuckle, and turns her attention back to the ocean as the Captain starts off.
 
Only.. (( Say... ))
 
(( Weren't YOU sleeping? )) The silence that follows that is enough to alert Nami to his intentions -- but isn't enough for her to get out of the way. She's already backing up, hands up in a 'don't - don't.. AUGH! Don't!!!' manner, when she's seized, thrown over a shoulder, and hauled off .. AGAIN! 
 
""Not this again! LUFFY! Put me down! I can walk on my own!""
 
(The player is freely sued, because the idea of Nami getting dragged off amused her far far too much.)
 
""You're the one that woke me up in the first place!!"" It'll be typical of him to ignore this detail though. Butyou can be sure she's locking that door again, after he leaves! >.<



""Really?"" laughs Luffy, ""My fault?  I don't remember that at all!""  When in doubt, fall back on faulty memory!  But in spite of all protests, it's down the stairs they'll go, until he's deposited the navigator -back- onto the bed where he'd started this whole thing, pulling up and throwing the covers over her (and her head).

""...Oyasumi!""  Stomp!  Jeez, he's even saying that like he's giving an order for Full Sail! or something.  ...And then he's out of there before you know it.  He's pushed his luck well enough for one day!

Speaking of sleep, his hammock in the guys' quarters is sounding like a really welcome idea. c_c;"

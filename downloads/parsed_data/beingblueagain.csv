"event","No luck this time. The odds were stacked against me, so I'm not too surprised. I did get to take it to acquisitions and then participate in the auction, though. I'm really, really bummed I didn't win, of course, and I would've loved to have worked on such a gorgeous novel, but we made a solid offer, and I feel like I did all I could for it, so I'm satisfied. Good luck, Author of gorgeous book!"

"event","As news of nearly every major publishing house axing its top tier and planning mass layoffs (and in one case, halting acquisitions) trickles into my inbox via PW Daily, I'm really, REALLY thankful for the company I work for and the job stability I can count on in these crazy, crazy times.


Addendum: while I don't disagree with Navah's sentiment, I owe SMeyer a big thank you as well."

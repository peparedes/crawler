And it&rsquo;s not just because I met Kathy, infact I think meeting her was as a result of sorting myself out in the latter part of 2009. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>I&rsquo;m so excited about 2010; it&rsquo;s been the best Holiday I can remember in a good while.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So New Years was another disaster, I headed down to Bournemouth with a couple of mates to meet up with Dom and his Sis for what was meant to be a big party down there but it turned out pretty terrible. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>It got to the point where I literally looked at my car and then my watch at thought &ldquo;Fuck, if I leave now I won&rsquo;t make it back for Midnight, but 1am is good enough... I can also pop by the bar, find Kathy and surprise her!&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I grabbed my bag, jumped in the car and left. Now, It&rsquo;s not a first for me disappearing and stuff, I am a free spirit and no-one will hold me down but I bet some people think I left so I could see Kathy, no no no that&rsquo;s wrong. Of course it would have been amazing to see her, but I wouldn&rsquo;t have left just to see her in that way. We&rsquo;d spent the previous night together instead anyway! I was pretty annoyed, and just needed to get outta there... At least Ruislip might have been fun and not full of idiots. I dunno, students are beginning to grate on me a little.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So, I drove and drove as fast as I could finally getting back into my town, parked the car and walked down to the bar to see if I could catch her outside having a cigarette. No. Instead, I talk to the DJ for a while before getting spotted by her friends who thought I was being a massive weirdo. Don&rsquo;t really blame them though...<br /><br />I did continue this entry, for ages, but the my brother accidentally switched off the router and I ended up losing it all AGAIN.

I'm SCARED... What am I getting myself into?&nbsp;I'm really into this girl. She's probably the first person I've spent an entire day with, without geting bored. I think I've met my match... I'll win though. :) I am kinda totally bowled over though... But ssssh. :P

I ran for ages tonight... Thinking of how cool this all is, it's about time there was someone cool and non psycho like in my life. Things are getting more and more interesting everyday. :D

Overall, 2009 has ended pretty amazingly, seeing everyone, lack of arguments and all. 2010 is looking very promising.

OK the other week I&nbsp;finally went out with a girl called Kathy. Now, I was thinking this time - &quot;I like this girl, so far she doesn't seem like an idiot so play it different&quot; and so I did. And like, we went and saw Paranormal Activity and yeah, it rocked. I drove her home and it was amusingly awkward... No goodbye kiss, different right? So, good things come to those who wait yeah? *laughs*. In all honesty, I didn't want things to be the same.

So I&nbsp;drove off feeling good about the evening, but at the back of my mind I kinda thought we may not speak again. Now that just wouldn't do, but again - different &quot;Ok, so just wait and see...&quot; I'm so tired of meeting these crazy girls, now Kathy is crazy - but in a particularly good way. So, last Friday we went for a drink, and I&nbsp;guess that's where things changed, for the better. It seems right, there is soooo a spark, right from her argument about me driving after having only two beers, (I secretly appreciated that. Alot. Well, guess it's not gonna be a secret for much longer!) to the coffee back at her house. Ok, so I'm not gonna let this sound cheesy, I'm gonna be logical for a change; Kathy has a great personality, can hold a conversation but, equally importantly, can have a laugh. Oh, and ofcourse she's raaaaather pretty. Is that the criteria, I&nbsp;think it is! The best thing is, there's no pressure. Whatever happens from here is cool.

All this is a big deal to me after all the crap that's been going on the past few years, I vowed to not have another Christmas / year like that... And I've made it, no more drama, no more wasting my time. I'm surrounded by good people, and I am fully me once again. Nothing is going to change that.

Things are gonna change even more dramatically early next year, I'm finally on the right path. So maybe this is growing up.

This public entry, December 22. It's a... Moment.

So the weekend was mad, but rar rar rar they all are. Fuck yeah... Or not, I'm not happy today really. I'm kinda, annoyed. I feel anxious... And tired, yet I'm still sat here writing bullshit and talking to a girl I don't even like, oh and Sarah... But that's ok, cause Sarah is someone I do like. And that's kinda like my permanent problem lol.

I spent a long while last night at Katies, kinda trashed off my face on an assortment of liquors, wine and beer. Ohhh yes. But we had meaningful and good conversation. I wish I could bottle and sell the feelings I feel when I'm with Sarah... I'd make millions. (don't need your money) That girl...&nbsp; And the conversation flowed, and my witty remarks caused smiles and lots of laughter. But then that one phone call, from him, and she was gone. And then I'm there, with so many people but at the same time alone. And I'm looking at the stars, and I'm wondering... Wondering why that very person, one girl in the whole wide world still means so much to me. And then Hannah shouts over ""Dane, Dane... BOYOOOO!"" or something crazy like that, and I'm back... I'm back in and thinking, thinking that... Well I can't remember, I just forgot.

So today, late to work again. Tired of the bus already and feeling lonely. It's too hot at work and there's no-one nice to hang out with, there's not even that cute chick to chat to. How I wish we could just go for a coffee break or something, man that place sucks.

But tommorow is a new day, and anything could be instore for me. Roll on America, roll on California... But right now, I'm not feeling it. Nothing's packed.

I'm very tired.

My thoughts are out there.x.

But hey. :) 

Crazy weekend, I ended up getting to Phils at like 3am last night once we'd left rocking out downtown... Sooo bad, I had work at 8, he musta turnt the alarm off or something cause I woke up and it was like 7:30 and I was like ""shiiiiiiit!!!"" so I had so like russsh so much, I ended up getting to work 1 hour late, but luckily the boss was cool with it all. 

I was pretty suprised this evening, Amy added me to msn, one of the cute Ohio Students we've been hanging out with. She's one of those people I met and instantly liked, and I know I -always- say this when it happens, but it's been a while. Too bad she's only in England for another 4 weeks. :( Best make the most of it! 

One of the other Ohio Students is kinda on my case, she's like beginning to really grate on me now, I think she likes me though so I don't wanna be mean or anything. Gah. 

But yeah, so court, I've a good feeling about it... Suprisingly. I'm not in the least bit nervous. 

I nearly lamped some Canadian guy in Walkabout last night, jeeeeesus, what an ass. 

Good times though, not long now til tour!!

The guy is a serious loser. <br /><br />Ok what else has happened? Well my whole birthday thing rocked, basically people came over for a BBQ friday but it rained so we did it at Doms instead, then walked down to mine and had some BEEEER :D and music, and fun really... Everyone had a good time, and I don't know why but even if I make minimum effort to organize something everyone still has a real good time... It's crazy, when other people do that it sometimes ends up being a flop. Saturday me and Phil went downtown london and arranged for everyone else to meet us at 7, just before we went to meet everyone Phil spotted this chick walking by us with some sweet tats, so he was like ""Hey nice tats!"" and an American accent returned a ""thanks! :)"" and so then I turned about and started chatting to them with Phil... So like we got chatting, and I found out they're from Ohio, the same state as Sarah :) :) :) plus they're all kinda cute so we asked them along with us, but ended up meeting up with them like an hour or so later... And it was like fate, or something crazy like that cause we really hit off with them, they're here for like another 4 weeks and we've been hanging out with them a fair bit, they're coming along tonight...<br /><br />To KATIES birthday party, woooo!

I had another amazing weekend, this time in a different way. The highlight of my week was obviously Amy, she came up yesterday for Charlies party... Which didn't pan out too well, but hey, Amy was there! We had a laugh and she got to meet some of my friends, espesh Phil and Hannah... She also got to meet Sarah, not that I planned that one. Jesus, what is up with that girl, she was behaving so oddly all night long. We kinda argued about it today, cause obviously... Sarah is always right and I'm always wrong. Haha, she'll never learn! Luckily, I've this great new ability to laugh alot of silly things off. Good people matter. Amy matters. :) 

So things are looking good, I really like her... It's crazy though, so much stuff has happened so quick. I hope it doesn't fuck up, she does really seem to like me though. She got a little upset last night when we went to sleep, and like, we pretty much spent the whole night talking about stuff that was upsetting her and that. She thinks I'm amazing for that... But I mean that's just me? But anyway, she rocks. She kinda invited me, well not kinda... She has, invited me to her leavers prom... I was kinda shocked at first, I mean I've not known her long. It's like right after I get back from the states, which seems kinda far off yet. I mean we could like, not be talking anymore by then nevermind seeing eachother... But we'll see, I've got a good feeling about it all. Imma try and arrange to take her out this week, and like ask her out properly :) We'll see. 

So stuff is good, saw Stu over the weekend too... Hahaha that guy, he rocks so hard. Something tells me it's gonna get me in trouble tommorow tho lol. Band practice tonight kicked ass, got there well late and nearly set the place on fire... Buttttt... We've started putting together&nbsp; a KICK ASSSSSS new song. It really sounds, like, catchy and perfect. I can't wait to get it finished. Stu also wants to play in a band with me lol.

So my holiday is sorted, I'm broke now lol... But there's so much to look forward to, as small as having a laugh at work and some cookies to flying out to California and having Amys prom to look forward to when I get back!

I've had the most immense weekend, it's been crazy! Friday I got off work and drove down to Woking for Amy's party, got a little nervous once I pulled up outside the house. I go up to the top floor (it was huge) and there's all these chicks in bunny outfits, hardly any clothes... I was the only guy there for aaaaages! But it was Amy I was interested in... She's well lovely.

So we danced, and got drunk... And I guess things happened we both regret, but it's ok, the next day we spent hours talking about, well, everything! She's totally awesome, there's no pressure with her for anything... Makes a change to meet a girl like that. Think we've arranged to go out Friday, she's gonna come up here. :)

Last night, Saturday... I went out with Dom and that, only this time Stuart came, I've seen alot of that dude lately... He's a really cool guy, it's fukin weird but he's someone I actually enjoy being around, good laugh, on the right wave length and not a dick head. :) Gonna go see his band play Wednesday, soooo good. 

Today I kinda woke up being like ""woaaah"" ummm... Went down the golf club for a beer with Stu and then got ready for band practice, had a cider, went there... Fuck, it sucks. It's serious bollocks, I can sing but the band can't play, it's as simple as that. The drummer is cool, and our er... New bass player. But Alex and Tom... Fuck sake. Got home from band and ended up goin down another pub for a quickie, Hannahs new boyf came. Not fully sussed him out yet, but he seems normal... Which is a good start for Hannah lol!

So yeah, work tommorow then rest, tuesday will rock, wednesday will rock, thursday... Er... Dunno and Friday I get to see Amy again!!! :) :) :)

So there was easter in England, and I had like a total of 6 days off work, which felt like ages and was kinda fun-filled, on the Friday I drove to woking to meet Maddy (at last) which was cool, but kinda strange... It was her 18th party and aside from some general asses and people a little far up their own asses, I met this rather pretty chick called Amy... It always feels like the same thing lately though I guess, I'm getting bored of it, maybe she's different' but to be honest, she's prolly not. We had fun though and we've stayed in touch, exchanging lengthy emails almost on a daily basis... She seems really sweet, apparently though I'm the first guy shes kissed since breaking up with her guy of like 2-3 years? Eeek! Anyway, cut a long story short I'm going a party at hers next Friday :) so I'm pretty stoked about that!

On the saturday I went out with Phil and we had a good time, as we do... Met some random americans from Oregon, they were a good laugh... Didn't realise they were like 30 something tho lol!

What does today have instore? Hmmmm... Band practice and karaoke I reckon, Imma try and make it a team effort tonight and drag everyone down to watch me, the king of karaoke haha, well in NW London anyway. haha.

There's also robs party wednesday cause he's back from Germany and then off to guildford Friday for another party! So stoked!

I also need to start figuring out what to do for my birthday in May lol, I don't wanna get so engrossed in sorting out my US trip that I kinda mess up my b-day, I'd love another party at mine but I doubt it's gonna be possible. We'll see though, there's still a while to go.

I'm really looking forward to some time off work soon too, deffo a well deserved break.. Things are getting pretty confrontational lately. It's all good though lol. I love dealing with people. 

So now I guess I shud get dressed lol... Woooo! I think I'm gonna get in trouble tonight, cause Dom's sister is such a hottie... Eeeek!

He does this amazing job, it's called being a Soldier... In the worlds best army. Now that started to remind me of what I've been doing since I quit school. Yeah. We won't go into that though.<br/> <br/> But while I was on his profile, I saw he had some new top friends... People I also went to High School with, and looking at their photos reminded me of how hard I've worked and pushed myself to change and I'm fucking <b>PROUD</b> of who I am, fucking proud of me. And no silly brunette bitch is gonna get me down again over a bunch of silly, immature but painfully reminding words.<br/> <br/> Never ever give up. <br/> <br/> <b><u>Be proud of YOU</u></b><br/> <br/> xxxxxxx</font>"

Fuuuuuuuuuuuck... Well ok the blonde one wasn't as bad, but there was this Brunette BITCH, made me feel awful; was such a shock.

I went home, I left.

Mo is cool though, major kudos to that guy - he's a good person, a very good person. It's people like that I wanna spend time with, not shallow bitches. 

Rocked out at band practice at the studios again yday, I dunno if it's all for me ya know? Sure I can play gigs... Yeah, if we ever get that fucking far this time, but is it me? I hardly have the image right now - We had a mini photoshoot yday, gah, I looked skanky... I hate always looking shit in photos. 

So yeah anyway, from today onwards gonna pick more carefully who I spend time with... No more wankers.&nbsp; 

Karaoke tonight, if I can hurl my self esteem level up from the floor it's crashed through. 

stay safe, love.

OMFFFFFG, skanks... At the highlest level. Ruined the WHOOOOLE night lol.

So yeah, this weeks been long man... But kinda&nbsp; a laugh. But like yesterday, I -finally- had a good excuse to go see that chick at work and then someone messes it up totally lol, I was soooo close. Well annoyed lol. 

Tonight is St Patricks day here in England and like it brings back memories of last year so much :( I was soooo smitten, I was dating Alex... Like the hottest chick in town, and... We went to a party in Edgware and she got wasted and passed out and I looked after her all night while she was pretty much throwing up in the bath... Man I thought that sucked a little but it didn't matter, cause she was my girlfriend.

This just highlights how much of an asshole I was for dumping her for Sarah and how much I wish things could be different. :(

I miss her more than before, not good considering I'm actually through with all the Sarah stuff for the most... I saw her at the pub Tuesday and she tried to be cutsie, I'm not feeling any of that anymore. All I see is a shell. I've awoken and realised I don't wanna look back and only see me moping over someone I loved but lost. It's the same with Alex... Allthough that was never as serious. 

So we're moving on, I've yet another new band... This time 'Sweet Syndrome' www.myspace.com/sweetsyndrome and Alex has pissed me off already by putting a shitty practice song on there where I sound totally awful.

I quite like my hair atm, allthough it's kinda a mess. 

Oh... And haha this like 30 year old chick at work has a crush on me apparently, how sweet.&nbsp; :) 

And Angela well wants to go out... Pffft. She's a hottie but I'm not feeling it for some reason.

That Emily girl on the other hand... :P

but no, cause I want someone a little older. Like... 20? 

Haha I'm such a hussey. yeah.

Ok time for the bath and mothersday shoppy shop shops. 

I need a new job too lol."

I'm in one of those moods today where I could just burst into tears, but that wouldn't be right... I wouldn't do it. Not these days anyway. 

I wish there was someone I could really confide in still, but that last person ruined any remaning trust I had left, but hey, best friends... Or in her case, girlfriends too... They come and go. 

I hate the way I sit here in my room and listen to all the abuse I'm getting from downstairs, it's horrible... Why are some people so nasty? The slighest little thing and she blows up, she never ever should of had children... And as for that wanker of a bloke, well. 

All I want is to be able to come home at the end of the working day and like get ready to go out, or chill at home in a nice warm feeling atmosphere... I hate arguments and fighting all the time, and being called everyname under the sun for no reason. It's really not be causing this... I've never had any problems anywhere else. 

Being here like this reduces me to a total low. 

More than ever before, I've got to get out... But I've no means of doing it, no money... Because it's all payed out on rent here to be treated like a cunt. No more.

Got there a little late, but was cool... Erm, went to hand out flyers with James in the queue for a <b>Rock Club called 'New Noise'</b> and then went in. Umm, James was really fukin stressed all night and this climaxed when 'someone' (I think Shannon, lol.) knocked Emma's hand, causing her whole glass of <b>Snakebite</b> to shower over her head...

We ended up walking back to Ruislip from Uxbridge lol, Hannah, Paul and me. <b>Haha, bad bad things happened. *blush*</b> <br /><br />Last Saturday was Amy's birthday party...

"event","Hello readers (if there's any about these days, seeing as alot of this is sneaky beaky)

First of all, I'd like to write about work, I've just finished watching the new Rocky movie and I'm in a well deep thoughtful mood: Perfect for writing here! This guy from work lent me the movie, he deserves a mention here... He's a really cool guy, one of those good people in the world :) makes me feel good. Work for the most is really good, that doesn't mean I'm enyoing it, but I like dealing with people and I could do the job with my eyes closed... However, I need more money, I need my own place. 

I'm getting used to Sarah not being around, we've been talking though and I've been thinking about her like everyday (nothing changes eh?) but on the other hand I feel like I dunno, like I'm growing on the way things are now, I'm seeing alot of Bryony I guess... It's complicated, well for me I think. I like her, and she likes me loads. Now like, 2 years back I wudda jumped at the chance of some pretty girl liking me, now I know better... Nice to know I've gained more self respect. Bryony is shy, but where she's shy I'm afraid of asking her out... Not afraid as in nervous, afraid as in not wanting to drag her into my crap, if we date she'll lose her innocence be it in a good way or a bad. I'm yet to decide if I'm the person who should do that. 

Just lately being at home has been hitting me hard, I'm sick of the bullshit and the way I feel I get treated, I hate the way I have to pay all this money too just to share a tiny room. But just yesterday I realised ya know, it's unlike me to let bullshit knock me down and I cheered up alot. I'm loathing the daily grind but for now I gotta hang in there... It's either this or unemployment. I know though, I gotta give myself more credit. 

I've no clue now, now clue at all where I go from here, where do I go from being a small fish in the world of careers... I don't really have my heart set on anything anymore, not even becoming a cop of some sort. But then I always let something haul me back from big change. It's gotta happen though. I don't wanna work in the private sector for much longer, I miss the pride and perks I had working in my old job, in the public sector. I wanna kick back though ya know? I don't want the seriousness... Infact all I do want right now is to not look a mess (cause I do right now no doubt), a cool hair style (i.e. when it grows back) and someone new to be smitten over... Good things come, and good things go, but god do I miss the feeling of sitting next to Sarah, falling asleep with her, listening to her snoring... Every last little thing, there's millions of them that only I know and have felt... They all leave me feeling so empty, like something has died inside me. I love her, and looking through clear lenses I know there's something there with us, it's special... But that doesn't mean Sarah is gonna choose to take it on, she's worse than me, she's a giver-upper... At the first hurdle, that was our relationship.

I wanna go visit her and Amber in Menorca, but I don't think Sarah's too keen. 

I hope one day she get's to read all of this writing about her, I know she's scared of the risks from the past. Gah, Sarah's always the main theme of my deep thoughts. I'm glad she's experiencing new things in Menorca :) 

Friends... My friends, your friends, our friends... Things are changing.

Love life :)"

We had drinks at the pub by the water with friends, I can barely keep clear eyes... I wanna cry.

I'm gonna miss her loads, and tonight I really felt that thing we have... We have the most amazing chemistry, but it just won't ever happen again. Can I even afford to ever take the risk?

I love Sarah Vernalucia :(

"event","Also sucked.

It really did, I was meant to go out with Phil but that never happend... So like, I end up going katies with Bryony, maaaaaan it was just rubbish. Then to top it all off Sarah turns up with Jesus, man that guy is such a dick head. It hurts so much to see him touching or kissing Sarah, I miss her so much... But after today, I've gotta put it aside. I've decided, tommorow is THE beginning. 

Ofcourse there's gonna be memories, and I'll never forget all the good times and things that made me smile and be happy. But I've gotta cut alot of it off now. Having all the feelings in the world wont change.

I'm really really excited about this year, and I don't even know why. But it's gonna rock, I've learnt from my mistakes. This year is gonna rock and I'm more self confident than ever! :) 

I plan on getting really fit this year, also starting tommorow... No more hours of lounging around online, I'm gonna be out there. Fuck yeah!

And... I'm gonna decide what to do, career wise.

"event","So I've not updated in a while, there's many reasons why but mostly the fact that I've just been fed up and lounging around aimless. 

I finished work for Christmas on December 22nd, which went smoothly, got home about ten after one that day... Was good, but at the same time there's nothing good about early finishes anymore, there's never anything good to do or anywhere fun to go. Man do I hope the days where there'd always be stuff to do and fun to be had come back soon. On the night of the 22nd I went to a couple of pubs with friends, was a laugh but not as fun as it should of been.

The next day, Saturday was spent doing some uuuuuuuuber shopping, managed to sort stuff out quite well so was cool... Shops were way busy though. Afterwards I drove over to Sarah's to give her a Christmas card I brought for her... I dunno what made me do it, I wasn't going to, but I ended up just getting her one and writing in it... I know, I just can't let go. So I called her up and she came out and we chatted for a little while... It was amazing to see her, it was the first time in like a month... She looked amazing, but then she always does. It was all a painful reminder though of everything that's gone from my life, and how it was this time last year. 

Christmas eve was weird, I went out with James and Micheal for lunch at the Junction, was well nice and then we ended up going to Emmas for the evening... Fuck that girl is a loon, seriously, I cannot stand her... She actually looks crazy. Anyway, I was flirting with one of her mates all night which was a laugh and then like nothing came of it, ummm Emma the loon got well drunk and started getting agressive (again) and like when the night was over we all went home... Gay. I saw a new side to James that night though, he's actually kinda immature for a 22 year old. 

So, Christmas Day - DI-FUCKING-SASTER. It was terrible, Mom and The Asshole argued like all day and then she spent the rest of the day in her bedroom. She's just as bad though, she really doesn't help things. I'm sick to death of it, it's the same shit every single day of the year and you'd think for one day they could be adult enough to just keep the peace. But no. I feel painfully sorry for my Brother, I've seen it affecting him... He's getting one major attitude lately.

Boxing day was pretty much the same scene of events, I did a bit of shopping though which was frustrating lol... Everywhere was so so busy. In the evening I went over Amy's house with Becky... I decided that Amy is actually reeaaaally hot, but then there's loadsa girls I like. I'm not gonna do anything about it. It's not like I'd have a chance anyway!

Loadsa other random stuff happened inbetween finishing work and christmas, including partying with Bryony (and making out with her hot friend Penny :S) and er... Stuff. Bryony has admitted she really likes me now too, it's random, last night (new years eve) we kissed, it was awkward though... She's really unconfident. :S I dunno if we can go anywhere even though I do like her.&nbsp; Grrr girls girls girls girls, why can't I find a nice girl who's not crazy, mad, posessive or anything else. Just nice and caring and beautiful etc. :) One day lol.

So that was Christmas Two Thousand Six. 

Nex year I hope I'm with good people.

"event","I'm fed up, I've sat in silence pretty much the whole night... All I keep hearing is shouting, and I constantly think... This holiday is doomed. 

Things are gonna get worse before they get better though I guess.

Still... On the other hand, Bryony... :) Last Friday, wow, it was so messed up... But I know now, I got that feeling. You know? Like when you realise you LIKE someone. She was different too, she was less quiet... Which rocked. We had a laugh, and I teased her a bit much. She's well cute, I'm not so sure if it's me she likes though... She's kinda quite and secretive about it. There's a good chance though... We'll see. She likes someone though, I know that. 

I went Guildford Saturday, OMGGGG got there and realised I didn't have Chez's number which meant I spent 40 minutes trying to find the Studios after I'd parked up at the Hotel. Gayness, allthough it was an excuse to ask the MAJORRRRLY cute girl sitting in the Train station newspaper thingy for directions. I didn't make any effort to mention anything else though, just like I don't with any girls I meet lately... It always ends up going wrong. Anyway, EVENTUALLY found the place and bumped into Dara and Felix and Pat and his new girlll which was pretty rad. Ummm... Then went and brought large amounts of Strongbow and Carlsberg and got trashed, inbetween getting fucked off at Chez for no proper reason (when she actually finally got there), allthough she was a bit self important and erm... The bathroom and that chick... Uhh go figure. Way too much beer. 

So then it was into the back of some bands van and back to the Hotel... Barely knew what was going on, ran to the lift chez etc was getting in and then some dude was getting mouthy and rude and instead of telling him to get fucked like I usually would I randomly got outta the lift real quick and went to my car... Bad things. I wanted to be alone for some reason. I was fucked off though.

MAJORRRRR hangover Sunday, was ok after fooooodddss though!!!!111

Tommorow is Tuesday, it's also the Christmas party for the defence services part of the company... Free bar, good eh? Shame there's no-one worth going to hang out with. Think I'll give it a big miss. 

So it's almost Christmas, and it feels nothing like it... I've got no gifts or cards for anyone yet and I wish the whole thing would just go away.

*sigh* How did I get like this?"

I don't even try with people now, don't take that risk of becoming friendly... I just keep on the iced out face and behaviour to reduce the risk of anyone even considering to think I'd be a good new friend. 

I barely smile at them, they see me everyday... I don't get too personal. I don't let on any of the interesting things about me. I don't want to be hurt anymore.

It's becoming a big problem. Professional to the end? 

Give me a beer, drown my sorrows. I'm wallowing in pain, hurt and utter frustration. 

I work... I work and I work, the weekend comes and I end up doing fuck all or spending it with people I don't really even like. Last Saturday I ended up walking the streets of London alone.

I completely distance myself at work, I show very little emotion. I just do my job, I get by... Looking ahead to the day I'll fly.

But it seems like that day is never gonna come.

I miss Sarah so badly. It's been about 3 weeks now since I've even seen her. I'm still not over her... The closest person to me, the one person I really Love despite everything, and she's gone. Out of my life... Just like that.

Just tonight I pushed another person away... Alex... My ex, my supposed good friend. I keep doing it. I think I love her, in a weird way. But let's face it... I'm ripping whatever we have left of a friendship to shreds.

It's gonna be a lonely holiday. 

Until next update,

That Emma chick turnt out to be a serrrrrrrious -LOON- so like I managed to escape her, allthough something is of mine is at her house :S. She was bad in bed too... It was quite embaressing. 

So I'm here with a beer now, had intended on writing a massive entry but am too tireeeed.

I like Bryony... I think she likes me too, oh, here we go again? 

Phil has been amazing these past few months, he's an awesome friend.

This year has rocked, I want a happy ending so badly, for myself and to prove to that Sarah who's now dating that ASSHOLE Micheal (JESUS) that I don't need her b.s. anymore.

Emma is so lovely :) can't wait to see her! Saturday is aaaaages away though! =[ =[

I wanna speak to Sarah, or even better meet up... She's been on my mind alot, but then that's nothing new. Ugh, I hate that she's upset as much as she deserves it.

"event","My date with Emma Thursday was really nice, I have to admit though I felt pretty nervous for the first time in aaaaaages when I arrived to pick her up! She got in the car and there were alot of awkward silences but I asked her lotsa stuff and she asked me, it was really obvious she was just as nervous. 

So like, we got there early so we went for a drink first and then on to the Movies, Click is such an awesome movie, so much meaning behind it! Suprised me for anything with Adam Sandler in! After the movie we headed back to Emma's and like when we got there it felt really awkward, I think she wanted to kiss goodnight and I was like ""Take Care Emma *smiles*"" lol when she got out I cudda kicked myself, I felt so stupid, I didn't think she liked me at all. 

Anyway, turns out when she got in she spoke to James (who pretty much set us up in the first place!) and she said she really likes me and stuff and that she wasn't sure if I liked her.

So anyway cut a long story short, Friday night I went to Katies/Sarahs halloween party and it ended in disaster... I got kicked out of the house and Sarah apparently cried her eyes out til 5am. Am I proud of myself - NO. But it's not like I was out of order towards anyone. 

Tonight, Saturday, or last night seeing as it's officially Sunday now I picked Emma up and didn't really have a plan, after things fell through we ended up renting a movie with Amy and Becky and going to Beckys house... The movie sucked but me and Emma flirted a bit much, which was a relief, and after the movie things no longer felt awkward... We left for her place and when we got in the car we kissed =] it was a really cool moment... She's a really nice girl, and a -bit- pretty :) 
(dunno why she likes me lol) :P 

So yeah, dropped her home and now I'm here... Feel good really cause the night cudda been sooooo much of a disaster. 

She starts her new job Monday so I'm seeing her Saturday, at hers, shud be cool. :)

Diddoooo :) Emma-Jane rocks.

Out all the time at the moment, sleeping lot's too. Big lie ins, tea, lol. Not run outta money... Yet!

Things with Alex have gone from weird to bad to worse and since Tuesday night things seem okies again. I was giving her a lift to Pub, she didn't get in so we went to some dudes house and had a laugh then dropped peoples off and we talked on the drive back to her house. Was good. Allthough I think we're both very confused. I sat in that guys house looking at her thinking ""Alex is sooooooo amazingly beautiful!"" I don't even know what I saw in Sarah nevermind all that bullshit.

And yes, that's another thing... Found out Sarah went on a date today with that Micheal guy. What a prick. He really is, and even better he's gonna be at Katies party Friday... Hahahaha, bring it orrrrn.

Lol, in the meanwhile I have a number of chicks on the cards, right now is this girl called Emma who I'm picking up tommorow evening and going on a date with =] I'm well looking forward, she seems really cool. My friend James has kinda set us up, she's one of his mates and I've not actually met her yet :S lol. Random! Also, there's Becky... The girl who lives close by, I think she likes me alot. And I feel quite bad, she's cool and stuff but like I kinda like her mate Amy more. Amy is sooooo silly lol but she's well cute, the kinda girl I'd like try so hard to impress by doing something silly (like I already have, we have this thing about Odor Eaters) I don't think she'd like me for one minute though.

Haha, but according to Rosie I flirt with everyone so hmmmm... I dunno. That's me lol.

Got an interview at RMA Sandhurst tommorow, I'm not going tho cause it's too far. I couldn't work there even tho I'd love to do the job I've been offered but it's just too far to commute. Got this other job on the cards tho, also involving the Military. Tis' looking hopeful (22k salary!), should find out tommorow!

Hmmm so like yeah, I've figured out my paths... Mainly for next year, I've figured out the two things I wanna chose between now. I think. Typical of me, lol!

But seriously, FUCK Sarah, I'm actually glad we're not together anymore... I'm having the summer I never had right now because she was always fucking causing me issues or upsetting me and I just took it. Bitch. And tonight Hannah said I'm just bitter but NO-ONE seems to even come close to understanding other than Alex about what she's done to me and the people around me. 

Live life to the max, peace out! =]

"event","Ok, I guess I'm having a bit of a blast lately.

Last night for example, was soooooooooooo fucking random. I just got home!

I went out with the intention of having a couple of Beers in Camden, and what happens? I end up at Thames Valley University halls! Random, totally. Was a good laugh lol, allthough we didn't get to throw a TV out of the 16th floor window :( there were Irish Nurses though. 

There was also this super hot chick in McDonalds in Camden and like we found out shes German and studying Math at Uni, anyway, Phil got her number and I think they're gonna go out for a drink... Awesomeness! 

Tonight should rock too, I'm heading to University College London halls tonight with Alex (ex gf) (wooo she just called me! =]) and other random friends of hers, might see if Phil wants to come!

Tis gonna rock. Believe me in a way, it's cool not to have to have Sarah's weight on my shoulders. That doesn't mean she hasn't been hassling me though. Ugh. I won't get started, but seeeeeriously. At the same time it's just a horrible, terrible shame. 

<i>""Through this you know how I'm feeling...""</i>

Peace Out =] xoxoxoxox"

"event","This has been a very, very, very long time coming. I've sat each day at some point and thought about writing, facing my pain and getting it all down in words on here. It's not happened until now... It hurts just thinking about all the goings on.

But yeah, here I am now, with my laptop ready to tell all, for my sake... So I'll never forget all the little ways I got fucked over. 

Again, where to begin?

I know... 

So Sarah, me and her split up at the beggining of September, I'd very recently just quit the Police and then she started getting really weird over nothing, we went out on a Saturday downtown London with friends, I remember arguing with Katie and she pushed me over and obviously me being a guy and her being a girl I didn't touch her. Sarah however, got really pissed at her. Anyway, the night went on and I remember we were in Burgerking at Piccadilly Circus and like we were all sitting upstairs and like that romantic sounding Aerosmith song came on and Sarah said she didnt like it cause it reminded her of something... I knew exactly what that was, the whole week had been about that fucking asshole Karl. He'd left on Friday, he's moved away but before he went she was spending time with him, this caused issues but I was cool about it ya know? Sensible. But no, I dunno, one thing led to another and at the end of the night she said she wanted to split up for some bullshit reason... We talked for ages and she changed her mind only for Monday to come and be the famous night that ended it all. Basically, we were at a gig and it was eating away at me... The Karl thing. So I asked her about the things that were on my mind, and she got pissed. Way pissed. The next day, we split up. The end, game over.

And it's not stopped hurting since. But I believe everything happens for a reason, ya know? I think there is a God, because I'm beginning to see things I never ever saw before... Sarah is like a puzzle... Everyday, every week, every month another little piece falls into it's correct place and the rough outline of things at the moment, the way the picture is beginning to go and show is that Sarah is -nothing- whatsoever like the person she appears. 

So cue Alex, Friday night... That's the latest development, Alex my perfect ex girlfriend who scared me off by telling me she loved me... I regret spliting up with her almost as much as wasting a fucking year on Sarah!

Alex is really upset lately, I honestly, honestly never realised she cared about me so much... It's kinda hit me really fucking hard. I thought she got over me and her ages ago and that the things she said were just because she's like ya know, younger. How wrong was I!! She's pissed at me, since Friday and then I ended up making out with this cute girl called Joy and she saw, and made out with Alex the boy from Pinner. I was like WTF!!! He's such a fucking dick, he came Saturday to Hendon too grrrr... I was getting close to harming him, he just has that stupid fucking look on his face and a personality of a fucking plastic butter knife! grrr.&nbsp; He well tries it on with her and it makes me jealous as fuck. I guess my mistake was telling her... See now it looks like I'm trying to get her back cause Sarah's gone. It's so not like that, but I understand.

So... My new lease of hope, the thing thats stopped the sadness and crying and constant pain and feeling for Sarah is Alex... It's serously fucked how things have come full circle. I realise now though, if we'd stayed together I think we'd of had the summer of our lives. My summer in reality was all just Sarahs weirdness and making mistakes. I've wasted time, but I've learnt alot. I wish I hadn't quit the Police so badly. I've gone from 22k a year to fuck all lol... Ohhh and that brings my temp job into this entry, yeah, I was temping with Social Services OMGGGG... It's not even worth talking about, that was some seeeeerrrious bollocks. Hillingdon Council has to be the worst in the U fucking K!

So now I'm here, October 18, 2006 and I've been on a 5 day bender thats taken me to new people, phil, his new band, other proper punk bands and shows, and to brighton and back. So now I guess it's ""shit, I need a plan!"" time.

Sorting stuff with Alex is top of my list and right after that is finding a job and figuring out what imma do with my life long term lol.
 
I'm feeling ok. I believe. 

Regular updates will follow :) Maybe even one later :P

Tonight... Has been amazing.

I know now well and truly, I don't need to keep going on like this anymore.

This is a new start... 

I'm in a good mood, allthough I've been feeling bursting into tears all day.

But this an entry that will be a memory jogger, it'll remind me of how hard the last month has been. 

I love you all lol :P xoxox"

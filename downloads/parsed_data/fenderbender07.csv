"event","well today was the day....my last day to see Benny(Elder Anderson)before he leaves on his wonderful journey. I went to church with him one last time this morning and his whole family was there. it was so nice, i love every single member of his family. it was a great way to say goodbye. i have to say though i will miss the long 1 am phone calls, DSO concerts, random things that we do with eachother, spending time with his family and him in general. I do agree though that 2 years will go by faster than you know it especially since it is my senior year that is coming up soon. 

i just know that he is doing what he believes in, and will succeed in anything that he does. every ounce of luck to you Benny, and i will see you in 2 years. dont forget about me.

"event","so today i got up a 6:30 to drive up to Lawrence Tech University for their campus visit day.  Lets just say i didnt want to be there, but it really wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be...yea i would have much rather been doing other things...but it was pretty eye opening.  Realizing now that it really is time to start looking at colleges and figuring out my life...its kind of scary.  It did though, cement into my mind, that i want to go into some kind of design.  They had a great program, but i think it is just lacking the college life that i want, like living on my own and kind of away from home so i can get a taste of real life.  They also dont have a music program or any kind of music for that fact and that is just a neccessity in my life.  For one i want to minor in music performance and without music, life would just not be worth living for me.  It is like my mind, body and soul.  But yea so that was pretty much the highlight of my day, and wow it really got me thinking about life and just everything that is going to happen in my future.

then i came home, and just practiced my clarinet forever...i was having to much fun with Molly on the Shore.

then it was parade time, and eh it was same old, same old.

well thats about it...have a good relaxing sunday everyone.

i mean yea i had a really bad headache all day, and a crazy geometry test...but then i got to band and it was all worth it!!

So first thing, i walk in the band room and there is a new piece on my stand....didnt think much of it at first, but then i saw it, and thought ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME...ITS CARMINA BURANA!!!!!!!""...only one of my favorite pieces of music!!! its one thing to be able to listen to it, but play it, its a whole different ball game...i never thought i was going to be able to play that song in HS, but wow i am!!........and let me just tell ya, its ahhhhmazing to play!

then came the big one of the day.....Mr. Steele pulls me into his office, and says ""congratulations, you made the All-State Honors Band!""...ahhhhhhhhhh...i was so happy i couldnt believe it...out of 180 clarinets who auditioned, i got picked! after all the stress i put myself through to audition, it is one of the biggest accomplishments i have had in music, and i am just so happy!! Best part is, i get to go to grand rapids, stay in a hotel for three days and see 2 amazing symphonies when i am there!! this is just going to be such an eye opening experience, and i am so excited!

well thats about it for now, i hope everyone stays safe on those slippery roads.
have a fun weekend!

my car is so dirty...my stupid self decided to go down scripps this morning with it have been raining the night before...so basically my car looks like it went through a giant pool of mud and then it got all dried and caked on....whoa ok so enough about my car!

i am so glad that my hard work in school is paying off too!! i have had the best two progress reports i have ever had...A,A,A-,A-!! im so happy those are my grades right now...im actually doing good in math...me? good in math? no..i never thought it was possible!

i wore a really random shirt today too...i got it at the salvation army and it says turnstyle on it...i heard it was some kind of band but if anyone has any suggestions to what it means, then i will gladly take them...cuz i know what a turnstyle is, but just not why it would be on a shirt. i guess it is one of those mysterious questions of the world.

i love what we are playing in band...the songs are so good and full of emotion! im so happy...i think i have worked everything out!!

now this is a serious fact...i really need more classical music, but ahhhhh i am so broke...i dont know where it all went...really i dont!!

and i have lessons tomorrow...hopefully i can work out scaramouche a little bit better for shelly!!

well wow..today the lord was definately on my side and blessed me with a happy day..hopefully it will be just as wonderful tomorrow!
have a great day!

but anyway...last night i went to the DSO with Benny! honestly it had to be one of the best DSO concerts i have ever seen...yea call me a band geek, i dont care, but that music was so beautiful and moving and so full of emotion that it actually moved me to tears...i mean adagio for strings(do i even have to say anything) and then lincoln portrait was amazing with the actual words of abe lincoln being spoken while you listen to the music....ahhh it was just sooo good...........oh and we also got all snazzied up and went to macaroni grill...it was sweet, i got to draw on the table...pretty tight eh?

so in a way..my tears were happy tears of just hearing beautiful music, but it also made me think...which with me can sometimes not be a good thing...but at least someone was able to turn my tears into laughter.

i think thats about it for now....i am very bored....blah.

"event","wow what to say.....

so this was pretty much one of the best weekends ever!

friday i went to the away game, got lost and really frustrated on the way home, but thankfully found my way and besides the game was to much fun and even though we lost, our boys are amazing!

then sat i had to work, from 8 in the am till 4 in the pm, which really wasnt that bad.  it was a pretty easy day...i was like the cook all morning at breakfast, and then i was in back booth in DT and then front DT which is my fave place to be. then i asked heather if i could get off work a half hour early and she let me go, so that was a half hour earlier that i got to see benny and give him his birthday present and just hang out with him for 2 hours.

then sunday was just the greatest! everything was just so nice and so much fun...going to church with benny in the morning and listening to him speak was so great and then going to his dads house for the rest of the night and just spending a night with him and his family was so nice. i was just so happy that i got to spend such a wonderful day with my best(to infinity!)friend on his birthday. and we def cannot forget the crazy being blown off the road car ride and amazing russian music on the way home.

so all in all it was a fun, exciting, special, rejuvinating and relaxing weekend that i never wanted to end.

i hope everyone else had just as much fun on their three day weekend!

later!

"event","so i havent updated in awhile, and i dont really need to talk about last weekend, since everybody already has, but i am still going to do it anyway...

last weekend was definately one of the best weekends that i have ever had!  The friday night football game was amazing.  It was so cool being down on the field while the team beat clarkston!! our show went pretty well too!  Then after the game, i went over to Benny's house for a little while, and he showed me all of his ""pimptastic"" suits! then we hit the band party together and listened to some sweet music on the way.  The best part there, was when we took a picture, and there was a third head...dum dum dum! haha..after the pary, i went back to his house and we sat in his car for a little while and listened to some more amazing music.........i wish i could have more days like that...........i wish life could always be that simple and that happy........

Saturday we went to the great lakes invitational...nothing much to say there, except that we kicked some major boootay! 3rd place, great job guys...i got home at around 12:30, and had another great 1 am conversation. 

Now..back to the present..last night i went to benny's to hang out and we just sat in his room and talked and listened to music...so much fun..brought back alot of great memories...ahhh i love music....Mahler 2!!! most amazingly beautiful piece of music i have ever heard.

FRIDAY.......DSO........Symphonic Dances...cant wait!!

Well this is really long and i am in school, but i just needed to right down my thoughts.

take care everyone...

A guy and a girl both best friend chatting online

girl- hey
guy- hey
girl-whats up
guy-nothing, i have some really bad news
girl- what is it?
guy- im moving
girl-you cant move
guy- i am my parents are making me. were moving out of state
girl-you cant go. i'll miss you to much
guy- i know i'll miss you too
girl-i love you
guy-i know, i love you to
guy-i g2g now
guy-later

the girl was sad. not only because he was moving but because he didnt love her the way that she loved him. she had been in love with him since the day they met.

they meet for pizza the day before he leaves. they talk and the girl is worried that she wont ever see him again or that he wont remember her. but the guy promised that he would never forget her and that he would come and visit. they were about to leave when the girl said i love you again. the guy said i know i love you too. we'll be friends forever. although the girl was glad they were friends she was torn up inside that he didnt love her the way she loved him.

he moved the next day. when he got to his new place he got online

girl-hey
girl- i want to tell you something
guy-can it wait i dont feel like talking now

it went on like that for a few weeks. then he stoped talking to her completely. she never got to tell him what she wanted.

the guy came back to visit a year later. the girl ran up and gave him a hug

girl- i missed you so much
guy-do i know you
girl- funny, im your best friend
guy- i dont think i know you. please get away from me now

this destroyed her. she decided to leave. just then a car came around the corner. it was about to hit the guy. the girl ran and jumped in front of the car pushing the guy out of the way. the girl was dead. the guy was invited to her funeral not knowing why he was there since he thought he didnt know her. just then her dad read the last entry out of her diary.

it read: my best friend has moved away. he has stopped talking to me online. i am very sad. i fell in love with him the day we met. but he did not love me the way that i did. i tryed to tell him how i really felt but he didnt want to talk to me. he finally quit talking to me all together. i havent heard from him in months. i miss him dearly. i never got to tell him that i really do love him and that i would do anything for him. even die for him.

just then the guy remembered who she was. he felt horrible. he had forgoten her. he broke his promise

IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE AND YOU WOULD DIE FOR THEM EVEN IF THEY DIDNT KNOW WHO YOU WERE OR FORGOT ABOUT YOU THEN REPOST THIS...IF YOU WOULD NEVER FORGET SOMEONE YOU LOVE THEN REPOST THIS

REPOST THIS AND IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS THE ONE WHO LOVES YOU WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY LOVE YOU AND THAT THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU

this has to be one of the saddest things i have ever heard...the sadder thing is that when i read it i saw me...i saw me and adam almost 3 years ago when he moved...this exact same thing happened to me.

i would die for any one of my friends...they are the greatest people in the world:-)"

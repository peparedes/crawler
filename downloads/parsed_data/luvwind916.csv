"event","this weekend has been amazing, friday night i hung out with Mike, JC, and Amanda, and we went to the battle of the bands for mike's friend Wes's band; synapsis or something like that, i actually really liked them. it was so hilarious though cause the little emo dudes where doing this dance, definitly went home and tried it just for fun. after that we went driving around, gotta love when a song comes on and everyone in the car is singing at the top of their lungs, (haha plus mike who was singing at the top of his lungs at the wrong parts and had the rest of us cracking up). after a little bit we ended up back at my house, double teamed at pool (got my ass kicked lol, sorry mike) then i had excessive amounts of energy so i grabbed a blanket and went outside with mike and we crawled on top of his car and just layed there talking, it was sweet and mike is becoming someone i love talking to. saturday was great because i got to go shopping with my lovely miss kelsey! its so much fun dress shopping and eating icecream on the mall steps watching the merry-go-round. i really did love getting to hang out with just kels, we dont seem to do that very often any more, which needs to change. after that i went to the admirals game with JC, Katie, Mike j, and Mike k (all the uncool people who didnt get invited to a party). mike(k) and katie are so cute together, i really hope it works out between those two. but i got to spend the night between JC and Mike (j) which proved for lots of laughs and a very good time, even if the admirals did lose. and today im going to the art museum with JC and then Hallow scream which im really excited about!! hehe hopefully its a perfect ending to the weekend"

"event","today was pretty good, was still on a slight high from yesterday. definitely woke up late this morning and did about 45 down edwin but still got go school late, it was all good though cause we had a sub for art (that class is great!). english could have been better though, we had a test comprised of 7 questions which you have to respond to with an extremely long paragraph, that was kinda stressful just because im not very good at writing within a time limit but hopefully i didnt do to terrible (fingers crossed)but it was awesome to hear them announce that cross countrys going to regionals. power lifting was really good today, i got in a great workout though i offically hate power cleans! those things hurt! and i looked like a duck lol anyways mr mcgowan let me go run when i was done, and it just felt great to be out there by myself. the weather was so gorgeous, i dont know it was just relaxing ( runnings relaxing, who knew??). tutoring was insanely uneventful, but i love mrs Dultry, shes such a sweet lady, she let me come back during lunch because my field hockey friends had a game so they werent gonna be there. cross country was slack today, it was pretty much just yoga which i got to look very retarded doing (go me lol). then jc took me home and after he went for a run we just hung out and watched tv, other then that is was a very lazy afternoon which i have no problem with... but now i really have to do some homework which ive put off all night"

"event","ahh! omg im on such a high! i cant believe we're going to regionals!! im so insanely proud of every one who ran today! they did a kick ass job! hehe im in like a euphoric state im so excited! even though i couldnt run today just watching everyone and cheering them on, makes those insane intervals worth it. i cant believe we did it, both teams! this team definity feels like family, i love them all so much and i cant wait to watch them run in regionals. hehehe regionals should be great, plus i get to see masons friend chris there,who i met at hunt club and seemed really nice and who knows maybe get to know him a little better. ah i cant stop smiling, im just so happy that this day turned around for me, just being out there and part of the team, then on the bus singing at the top of our lungs to disney and spice girls, kempsville is decidedly the best damn team ever"

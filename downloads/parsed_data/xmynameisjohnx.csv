 I give everything I surrender...

 Clean this old house
 Time to breathe in and let everything out
 That I've wanted to say for so many years
 Time to to release all my held back tears

 You're up to something bigger than me

This trip's been beautiful. I love Rome. I love Pompei. I love smart cars, :D. I love alot of things. 

God's really hit me here on a number of occasions. The biggest one being when I walked into a church where Peter and Paul had been kept as prisoners before they were martyred. It was so awesome. There's so much history here, the Ancient Romans were incredible, the artists during the 1500-1600s are incredible. Everything here is beautiful. And the Gelato is delicious, :D. Ha.

It's amazing how much change can happen in just a week,

I'm finally ready to be just your friend.
I didn't think I was gonna be here for awhile, but I'm ready to do that now.
So, if/when you're ready, wanna go back to being just friends?

I guess I shouldn't say go back, as, well I've never fully thought of you as just a friend,
but, are you ready to start? 
I don't want to lose the only girl I can trust with everything.

"event","I'm so speechless right now.
 But I feel like I'd be able to write pages upon pages.
 I still can't get my head fully around what's happened, whenever I try, I stop myself from going there, because I don't want to.
 This actually scares me alot, because I don't know how anything will turn out.
 If you had asked me a week ago where I'd be in five years, I'd have an answer, but today, I have no idea.
 
 The fact that we've put so much of ourselves, our time, our effort into this, and now...what's all that done?
 Shown us that we can never work because neither of us want to change who we are.
 I've always liked planning for the future, but it's becoming more and more apparent to me that whenever I do, things don't work, and I'm always let down by myself for making these plans.
 
 It scares me to think that God could make a girl so perfect, but still have us be incompatible to be together,
because, what about the next girl? Sure, it's gonna be a very long time, but what if I get to the same place I did this time...only to find the same issues?
&nbsp;I don't even know how easy it'll be to open up to someone else like I did with you.&nbsp; I trust you with everything about me, and I like to think you trust me, and I don't get to that point with most people.
 
 And the last thing I want is to be thought of as the same as the last guy.&nbsp; I think you mean more to me than you have to any other guy, and....I really wish I could change something about us.
We're practically perfect in every way. But I guess that's where the problem is, practically.&nbsp; But I hate thinking that a 99% still can't work. Why can 1% be so big?&nbsp; Maybe one of us will change someday, maybe.&nbsp; 
 
 All I know is I have to have faith that whatever happens is for the best for us both, and will give us both the best opportunity to grow with eachother,and with everyone else.
If things are meant to be they will happen. I can only hope that one day our paths to love will meet again,
and something will be different, and we can go with eachother from then on"

I just got this, sudden filling feeling.
Like, pure happiness.
But, nothing happened.
I guess, I'm happy for this happening, :].

Last night's bible study was honestly one of the best we've had, only topped by the week before.
they just keep getting better and better man.

"event","have&nbsp; you ever seen a picture, and had so many feelings rush in?
Has there ever been a moment where everything seems to click,
and you realize some things in your life are unchangeable, despite your best efforts to change them?
Has there ever been a time when all you want is for things to go back how they were, before everything?
That you could change one little thing you did, and hope you'd be happier now?
But you know, if you did it, your plans for the future would be worse off?
ugh.
I need some sort of change, but I don't know what.
I don't know who I am anymore, often times I'm disgusted by myself,
things I do/have done, people I've hurt, lately I've been getting very self conscious to.
I never used to be like that.
What happened?
Hm.
I need sleep."

"event","Wow, last night, after I got home from Spiderman, [freaking spectacular by the way], I was laying in bed...falling asleep...
and something hit me.
Everything I had been praying about lately, for the last month or so...
just, clicked.
And then, just to see, I put on my iPod and listened to a playlist I have of ""thoughtful"" [aka sad] music, 
and none of it effected me at all anymore.

I realized the American dream love,
has nothing to do with real love.
What most people think of as love...
the butterflies, the funny feelings, and whatnot, really....isn't love.
I don't think words can even express it.
There is not a way to truly describe it.

Seriously though, last night,
everything just felt as though it were lifted off my shoulders,
I feel so light now.
Praise God?
Um, yea.
:]."

Friday was just a night at home,
I got to think things through, just listening to music in my room till about 4.
It was nice.

Then, Saturday, Stephen came over and we played around on guitar/piano and I got the music for the songs we're playing wednesday,
sweet.
then Jamba juice/guitar center, pretty sweet.
I got a sheet with all the piano chords listed on it as a reference, sweet.

I had a nice talk with my big sister [Rachel] today after church,
that was fun,
I miss her :[.

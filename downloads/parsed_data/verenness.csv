"event","And with this post, I have a new Userpic.<br /><br />:]<br /><br />So this weekend has been okay so far. I'm in the middle of a two-day <a href=""http://wizards.com/magic/""><i>Magic: The Gathering</i></a> Sneak Peek event for the upcoming set release called <i>Eventide</i>. Basically, we get a bunch of booster packs from the unreleased set, build decks out of it, and go play with decks that we've built in like 20 minutes :D<br />It's a lot of fun because we play in such a casual atmosphere. Everyone knows everyone else, so every game is friendly. Win or lose, no one cares too much. Eight people play, so the person who comes last always has a ""WOO, TOP EIGHT!"" victory, and we all have a good laugh.<br /><br />In other news, I went to <a href=""http://www.strikebowlingbar.com.au/strike/frontpage.php"">Strike!</a> a couple of Mondays ago. That was fun, it was just a shame I had to leave as early as I did. Stupid full-time employment. :[<br />The pizzas there are to die for, they're awesome and thin and only $4 on Mondays. Cocktails were like... $6, and two games of bowling was only $10. I would definitely go there again if I get a chance.<br /><br />Backwards post is backwards. Anyway, the weekend before I went to Strike!, I went to the city with some friends to take some photos. I posted the best ones up on my <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/vancey/sets/72157606255936599/"">flickr</a>. It was a really enjoyable day out, so great to see old friends too.<br /><br /><br />Uhm, I think that's all I have for this post, so yeah x_x Here's a youtube video. It's <i>My Drive Thru</i>, by Santogold, Julian Casablancas, and N.E.R.D. Apparently it was done under contract for Converse or something, but I just love the way the video clip has been made. Enjoy.<br /><br />-Vance<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""13""/>"

As of last Friday, all of my exams were completed, and I could breath a little easier.<br /><br />I got some of the results back today. They were kind of lol-worthy. <br /><br /><font color=""#ff0000"">English Paper One -- ??<br />English Paper Two -- ??<br />Legal Studies -- <font color=""#0000ff"">56%</font><br />Software Design &amp; Development -- ??<br />Modern History -- <font color=""#0000ff"">51%</font><br />Business Studies -- ?? <font color=""#0000ff""><br /><br /><br /><font color=""#000000"">Anyway, I'll just pass these and go die in the rest of life. Sounds like a plan.<br /><br /><br /><u><b>EVENT NUMBER TWO<br /></b>Smash!<br /><br /></u>Smash! is a new anime convention in Australia, and it was kind of fun to go to. Plenty of artwork, collectibles, merchandise.. All so much fun. I spent around $80 there, got a few items. I'll list them again, because statistics prove that people pay more attention to brightly coloured lists.<br /><br /><font color=""#339966"">Domo-kun T-shirt -- $20 or $25, I forget<br />Death Note replica -- $15<br />A3 Artwork -- $6<br />Bookmark-sized artwork -- $6<br />Little Bleach phone thing -- $4<br />Yaoi manga, for my girlfriend -- $10<br />Food in the Maid Cafe -- $7.50<br />Pokky -- $4<br /><br /><font color=""#000000"">Now, that doesn't add up to what I said, because I'm not taking into account transport fares.<br /><br />Meh. Overall, a really fun day, really well organised. Hope they run it again next year, I might even cosplay.<br /><br /><br /><u><b>EVENT NUMBER THREE<br /></b>Movies<br /><br /></u>Yeah, I went with Kieran to see a movie because I was bored - Saw <u>License To Wed</u>.<br />It's actually a lot funnier than I thought, but still had it's cheesy moments, with a typical romantic ending.<br /><br />It was a waste of an afternoon, so all's well that ends well.<br /><br /><br /><u><b>EVENT NUMBER FOUR<br /></b>Return of school</u> <br /><br />Yeah... Normal lessons started again today. Got marks back, as stated above, luckily it was only a short day.<br /><br />School gets a one-line entry because it's gay.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anyway, aside from people misinterpreting what I've said, and catching me at a really bad time, life hasn't been overly terrible.<br /><br />I still have issues to deal with that aren't going to come out on a public blog,&nbsp; but hey.

"event","...'kay.<br /><br />So, my day was pretty packed. I've finished a week's worth of exams, so I decided to ""chillax"" and go to watch a movie. <br /><br />I called up my friend[K], we headed out. We were going to watch <i>The Simpsons Movie</i> at 3:10 PM, and then just hang out for a bit..<br /><br />Yeah, the local high school decided to have an excursion or something to that session. Joy. So we bought tickets for the 4:20 PM session, and went from there.<br /><br />I'd have to say, I expected more. Overall, it was still a good laugh.<br /><br /><br />Then, on our way out (as I was desperately fiddling with my new phone to try and get their stupid bluetooth thing to work), K noticed that <i>Die Hard 4.0</i> started in half an hour or something. SO, we walked around for a bit, and then watched that.<br /><br /><i>Die Hard 4.0</i> is a surprisingly enjoyable movie. As usual, Bruce Willis is invincible, and of course, still using his catchphrase.<br /><br />After that it was starting to get kind of late, so we walked around a bit more in the dark, trying to look cool. Failing miserably, but hey.. The effort was there.<br /><br /><br />I almost got into a fistfight with some random bogan in the arcade, though. That was fun. Let's just say, I don't take lightly to being called a ""fat cunt"".<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Also, I spent more money. $35, or something. Bought me the whole <i>Robot Chicken</i> season 1 on DVD. As such, I'll leave you with a song by Sick Puppies, 'All The Same'.

"event","So how crazy is this Internet thing?? I actually <i>flew to Portland</i>, to spend the weekend with a bunch of people I'd only known through the HHDA forum, so that we could attend the midnight premier of GoF! I had a freakin' blast, too!  Although, I am a little disapointed that none of them turned out to be a perveted guy intent on taking me to some motel and having his way with me. Ah well... maybe next time.  On the upside, one of them may well be a serial killer in the making. (You know who you are.) Anyway, here is my official GoF review:

<P><u>OVERALL IMPRESSIONS</u>
Not as good as PoA, but still a great HP movie. This is the funniest HP film ever, which is fitting because it was also the funniest book of the series. I found myself laughing out loud through the entire thing.

<P>My main gripe is that, as with PoA, the pace of the film was <i>way</i> too fast, with not enough ""filler,"" explaination, or backstory to make it as coherent as it could have been. I am constantly amazed at how the filmakers are able to strip so much from the books, add in their own stuff, yet still remain pretty faithful to the book (and the series). But I will never understand how Muggles are able to sit through the films and make sense of any of it. The first time I see one of these movies, I always get hung up on the parts that I think will confuse the newbies.

<P>Definately darker, but appropriatly so. However, this movie was nowhere near as beautiful as PoA. Alfonso Cuaron made each location (from Hogwarts, to the Shrieking Shack, to Hogsmeade) into a character in the film. GoF was all about Harry, so all the background stuff was just that; background stuff that was never meant to catch your eye.

<P><u>EFFECTS</u>
I had fully prepared myself to sit through a bunch of lame special effects. What with the Hungarian Horntail and Moody's magical eye, I braced myself for the usual half-assed effects that plague the entire Sci-Fi genre. Instead, the effects were absolutely amazing! The dragon (while not perfect), was by far the best screen-dragon I've ever seen.  The TWT, Moody, the QWC, and the fight with Voldemort all looked fantastic.

<P><u>THE GROWN UPS</u>
Brendon Gleason was great as Moody, and we <i>finally</i> got more screen-time with McGonagall and Snape. Let's hope that continues with OotP.  I know that the books have to be trimmed to make room for the important stuff, but the studio gurus have to be careful about not removing everything that gives HP its ""flavor."" I have two words for the studio honchos: Director's Cut.

<P><u>THE TRIO</u>
This is by far Dan's best performance to date. The dramatic stuff was wrenching, without being over-done; and he really is a gifted comedian. And yes, during the bathtub scene, I kept having to chant the word <i>jailbait</i>.

<P>Emma has been one of my favorite actresses since Sorcerer's Stone. It didn't matter that she was only 10, she was perfectly snotty and adorable. Emma can bring it, and this time out was no exception. And it's really staring to piss me off that she's so damn gorgeous.

<P>Rupert also gave his best performance so far - he really impressed me in this. His scenes with Dan were dead-on. You get the jealousy, the hurt, and the regret. They only thing he <i>can't</i> do, is a dramtic scene with Emma. Rupert is great when paired with any other actor... but whenever he has to act with Emma; he is completely flat. Take the Yule Ball for example: I've never studied acting, but my theory is that Rupert and Emma didn't talk beforehand about how to play the scene, so they played it in completely different ways. I could be way off base, but that's the best explaination I can come up with for how their scenes felt.

<P><u>CONCLUSION</u>
All in all, I really liked this movie. I've scene it twice so far, and hope to see it at the IMAX after the holidays. I'll be first in line for the DVD, but I don't think I'll be buying it in Portland."

"event","So I haven't posted in a while, so I figure I should.

<P>Still job hunting, but that's not stressing me too much.  Rather than take the first thing that came along, I decided I had time to be selective.  I've got an interview soon and if it works out, I'll be <i>starting</i> at the same wage I had afer 14 years with my last company.  I liked it there, but the pay was shit.

<P>Football is coming!  I am beyond psyched.  Bring. It. On.  In the meantime, I've been watching as many pre-season games as I can.  It's a useless indicator of how a team will do during the season, but at least I get to watch some football.  The last two weeks of pre-season aren't bad since the starters usually stay in for most of the game.  It's less like Pop Warner that way. *rolls eyes*

<P>Baseball.  My Angels are going to the playoffs (unless they suddenly do something very Angel-like and lose every game from now until October.  This could totally happen.  Don't count the Angels in until the last out is made.  They're idiots, but they're my idiots and (god help me) I love them.

<P>HP - my other obsession.  I have joined forces with some other people who felt that HBP was a joke (and believe me, there are a lot of us from all over fandom).  Someone started a forum, I've been there from the beginning, and the owner asked me to be a Mod!!!  There's not much Moderating to be done as everyone is really well behaved, but there is a lot of site-building going on, and I get to help with the creative stuff.  It's been a lot of fun.  It turns out that I really <i>need</i> to have a creative outlet (something I did not know about myself), which this site has afforded me.  I got some writing done, and got to hash out some ideas with the owner.  I love that place, and it's gotten me through the last 2 months."

"event","The new book? Sucked ass. In fact, the term ""crushing disappointment"" comes to mind.

<lj-cut>

<P>I wanted to wait a while before attempting any kind of review; let the book settle, so to speak. But time does not heal the wound left by the waste of trees that is HBP.  As I was reading it that first night, I kept checking the cover to make sure someone hadn't slipped me the wrong book by mistake. And when you consider that I had all the spoilers and knew every major plot point a week ahead of time, <i>that</i> is saying something.

<P>Having just marathoned Books 1-5, I was in full ""Potter Mode."" But when I got to HBP, it was like hitting a big, nasty speed bump.  The tone was flat, the plot dragged, the characters had been completely reinvented, and the ""voice"" of the narrative didn't sound at all like JKR.  It was as if she held a contest to see who could pull off the worst JKR imitation. (It's a sad, sad day when an author can't even manage a passable imitation of herself.)

<P>But even after re-reading the book (it was worse the second time around), I was convinced that there had to be a method to her madness. That there was a reason why every character was a shadow of their former selves.  Then came the interview.  The MuggleNet/TLC interview convinced me that JK had to have been high while writing this book.  Or high while writing the others and newly sober for this one.  So here, I will catalog the crimes against the HP fan base:

<P><u>Character Assassinations (or Who Needs Death Eaters When You've Got JKR):</u>
She slaughtered Hermione, stunted Ron, regressed Luna and Neville, glorified Ginny, and Emo'd Draco.

<P>We'll talk about Ron first.  In her interview, JKR said that ""Ron grew up after the Lavender thing, because he realized it wasn't what he wanted.""  Um... no. 'Growing up' would have been Ron being <u>man enough</u> to end it with Lavender when he realized he didn't care for her. Instead he took the coward's way out and treated Lavender with enough indifference to make <i>her</i> break up with <i>him</i>. Then, as usual, he apologized to no one for his behavior. If an H/Hr shipper had done this in fanfic, Herons would have accused them of bashing.  Well, guess what... now it's canon.  

<P>After all these years, after 'coming of age' in the Wizarding World, he's still the same selfish little boy who abandoned Harry in Fourth Year. This isn't me bashing Ron; this is me disappointed with how JKR missed so many opportunities with a great character. I wanted to see Ron mature. I wanted to see him come into his own with his newfound confidence. I wanted to see his abilities as a strategist (with chess) become an important part of the Trio's fight against Voldemort. This seems to be Ron's gift, but it hasn't come into play since the first book and I've always wondered why. Ron had a chance to grow in this book, and JKR couldn't muster it. 

<P>Hermione.  Remember her?  I do. Too bad she didn't make it into this book.  She was stripped of her morals, nerve, unwavering loyalty, pride, and self respect. She was unrecognizable in this book.  Because ""our"" Hermione was never right for Ron, JKR had to manufacture someone we'd never met before. She <i>was</i> a role model. Now she's the worst sort of hormonal-female stereotype.

<P>Remember when she wanted to tell Madame Pomfrey about Montague and the Vanishing Cabinet - just in case it might help his recovery? Montague was an 'enemy' but she still had the compassion to worry about his progress, and the moral fiber to want to 'do the right thing.' She went from that, to a girl who <i>jinxed a housemate</i>. And she did it so that Ron could have a spot on the team - a spot he probably didn't deserve. Remember her reaction to Ron getting Prefect -- another honor that he hadn't earned? Remember refusing to let the boys copy because, ""How will you learn?"" Remember Hermione going ape because Harry was getting potions grades he didn't deserve? Remember when she told McGonagall about the Firebolt because she was willing to risk losing her only friends if it meant saving his life? This is <i>not</i> the same character from the earlier books.

<P>As a woman, I have a problem with another woman jinxing an innocent person so her demi-boyfriend can make the team. I think it makes us all look bad, and I'm ticked off that a character that would never do this in any other circumstance, can do it now and people think it's <i>omgsocutesheloveshim</i>. (The shipping thing was <i>nothing</i> compared to this. In fact, the only thing that would have been worse, would have been if psycho-girlfriend-from-hell!Hermione ended up with Harry.)

<P>Luna was just sad. She was the best, most refreshing character in Book 5; but here she was almost pathetic. I felt more sorry for her than for Dobby and Kreacher combined.

<P>Tonks was fun and young and alive in OotP. In HBP she was reduced to a lovesick little girl with no spark and no will to fight. What's a woman without a man, after all? Please.

<P>Ginny was fun and Weasley-ish in OotP. It was like we were finally meeting her for the first time. I'd always thought that she would be a lot like Molly (feisty and tough), but also very powerful and smart. I'd hoped that HBP would allow us to get to know her better. Instead, she became the 'head cheerleader, popular girl' that everybody loves. There's nothing wrong with being pretty and popular, but where was the depth? Where was 'the journey' that JKR talked about? Where was the powerful witch? I didn't like this version of Ginny. She was arrogant, petty and mean.

<P>One thing that struck me in this interview was how little Jo remembers about what was in the books(?!). That became painfully obvious very early on in HBP. She was completely out of touch with where the characters were at the end of OotP, which is what made HBP so jarring. She goes on about how Ginny was the first female Wesley in several generations. Well, we all knew that, Jo, cuz you put in on your website... of course, <i>you never thought to mention it in the books</i>! Otherwise, the changes in the characters (and the relationships) would have been handled with a lot more grace and substance.

<P>She said in the interview that Ginny is extremely powerful ""as we have seen.""  The hell? First off, right there is an <b>anvil</b> that Jo forgot to drop. Second, according to <b>canon</b>, the only hex Ginny knows is the bat-bogey. Third, we've never even <i>seen</i> it. Not once. Fred and George mention that it's powerful. She used it against the Inquisitorial Squad in OotP - off page, so we never got to witness it's awesome power. *gag* Then Slughorn tells us about it in HBP.  So yeah... Ginny and Harry? Total equals. [/sarcasm]

<P>Why did I learn more about the author's intentions, plot, and character arc from an interview than from the book??  Jo needs to stop talking to herself and start talking to the readers. Had we known that Ginny was this all-powerful ""seventh generation"" whatever... we might not have been so blind-sided by her sudden 'perfection' in HBP.  And if JKR wants us to know important information about Ginny, she should put in the books, not just on her website.

<P>Worse still, what does it say that Ginny had to become pretty-sporty-popular-datable girl before Harry noticed her? Nice message to your young readers, Jo. The only thing worse was Ron's ""realization"" that even though Hermione was never pretty enough, or girly enough for him, it's her that he wants ""anyway.""  What a romantic. The implication is that he <i>settled</i> for Hermione... someone who is so far above Ron intellectually, emotionally, and magically that it's ridiculous; and he has done nothing in six books to deserve her.

<P>All those great female role models were absent from this book. I can almost forgive Tonks and Hermione being out of their minds boy-crazy. Love seemed to be the theme of this book. But to lose all of them? What was Luna's excuse? McGonagall? Molly? Ginny? Granted, the boys didn't fair much better; but as a woman, this just pissed me off.

<P>But mostly, I feel like I was <b>lied</b> to. JKR said that her characters tended to ""wander,"" Hermione in particular. She has also said that (1) she's had it all planned from the beginning, (2) the last chapter of Book 7 is already written, and (3) that HBP ""did what it needed to do.""

<P>You know what this sounds like to me? In this book, the pieces on the chessboard had to be set up 'just so.' Unfortunately, many had 'wandered' a little farther than she'd intended. And as a result, JKR had to cheat. She did something that an author (especially the author of a series) is never, ever supposed to do. She changed the characters to fit the plot.

<P>My theory is that JKR decided to <i>doggedly</i> stick to her original plans, regardless of where the characters had ""wandered"" in previous books.  In short, she wrote HBP exactly the way she envisioned it 10 years ago -- with complete disregard for the previous character developments. This book felt jerky and haphazard because she shoved square pegs (the characters) into round holes (the plot) that were predetermined a decade earlier.  She said this book did what she needed it to do. It was a 'means to an end.' After reading it, I find that very easy to believe; it had all the warmth and flow of stereo instructions.

<P>I had always believed that if H/Hr didn't sail, the rest of the books would still make sense. I believed that nothing could ruin how I felt about the earlier ones. But it turns out that so much of what I saw in them (the complexity and layers) was accidental and/or of my own imagining. Every day brings more proof of a sad, sad fact. JKR had to drop anvils because she isn't capable of leaving clues.

<P>As for the battle-cry from the other side that it's all based on <b>hormones</b>: Sorry, but I don't buy it.  You can't spend five books establishing personalities, quirks, character traits, motivations, and personal ethics, then have everyone act completely differently and blame it all on hormones.  It is what it is, <u>a break in continuity that is solely the author's fault</u>.

<P><u>Shipping (or Iceberg? What Iceberg?)</u>
My love for the characters goes far beyond any shipping preferences I may have.  Unfortunately, the characters had to be turned inside-out in order for the ships to happen.  Basically, the pairings in this book felt like they came down to a coin flip -- but without the suspense, depth, or emotion.

<P>R/Hr. Now, thinking about all the Harmonians arguments against R/Hr: It wasn't lack of clues.  We didn't miss the signs or ignore the obvious.  It is that they are <b>horrible</b> for each other. After six books, and JKR herself confirming the pairing, she still can't get Ron and Hermione in a room together without them hurting each other. The only difference is that now the hurting is physical and intentional. What a great role model for young people.

<P>JKR's sad, pathetic attempt and sexy banter is bad enough. But to have the relationship turn physically violent, and still insist that this is the couple to root for, is absolutely frightening and totally inexcusable. To cut down one of the strongest female characters in literature while doing it is despicable. I grieved for Hermione more than I did for Dumbledore. It was a character assassination and the only purpose it served was to enhance the worst Hollywood stereotype out there... only the pretty, smart, spunky, sporty Mary Sue deserves the hero.

<P>I'd read all the spoilers before I got the book, so I knew about H/G, and I knew that Ron and Hermione weren't together at the end of the book. So when I got to the scene with the bird attack, you know what I thought? I though JKR was sinking R/Hr. I thought she had fianlly ended the shipping war and was saying to her readers; ""See?! This is what it has come to. They are too different and they cannot be together. They will never understand each other or get along. Rather than become closer over the past six years, they've created a chasm that can never be crossed.""  Shows what I know, I guess.

<P>H/G.  Yes, the <i>idea</i> of H/G is very cute. The hero gets the fan girl/little sister-of-best-friend.  It is a cute idea.  But just because it's a cute theory doesn't mean that it can be dropped from the sky, six books in, and I'll <i>feel</i> it.  I've had years to fall in love with Harry, Ron and Hermione.  Being that Ginny at least existed in the Potterverse from the first book, maybe, just maybe, it would have had more emotional impact if Ginny hadn't been ignored in Books 1-4, reinvented from scratch in Book 5, only to suddenly inspired an Aliens-like reaction from Harry a third of the way into Book 6.  It's a sure sign of sloppiness on the author's part.

<P>Also, I'm thinking about JKR's words to describe Harry's feelings for Ginny...""creature in his chest, roaring in triumph.""  Okay, eww.  Did we forget that Voldemort's possession of Harry in OotP was also likened to a ""creature?"" WTF?  What kind of Harlequin reject drivel is <i>this</i>?

<P>H/Hr.  I'd like to say a word on behalf of the delusional.  Sometime after OotP, a literary critic came onto the Love Thread at the CoS board.  He did a breakdown of the ships and said that the most logical and obvious relationship was H/Hr, and that it was the only one (among the big three: H/Hr, R/Hr and H/G ) that made sense.  Yet, somehow, JKR is convinced that <i>we</i> need to go back and read the books.

<P>The irony of it all, it that it was us, the Harmonians, who respected the books the most.  We spent thousands of hours writing hundreds of well thought out essay and theories.  We broke down the books, scene by scene, looking for hidden meanings, clues, imagery, and symbolism. After all, she is the one who told us to ""read between the lines,"" and that ""nothing is as it seems in my books.""  So we took her at her word and set aside the ""obvious"" and the ""anvil-sized clues.""  <i>We</i> were the ones who insisted that she was writing something deeper and more complex than most of fandom was giving her credit for.

<P>She admitted that she had not read the other books since their publications, then had the audacity to tell <i>us</i> to go back and re-read the books.  She had the nerve to imply that we weren't paying attention to the text.  No wonder so many people (myself included) are pissed.

<P>And still many of the Herons and H/Gers insist that we're just upset about our ship. Fine, now we know who's sunk. But JKR still missed an opportunity to bring the rest of us along for R/Hr. There was no progression in R/Hr, only <b>escalation</b>. An escalation of hurting, fights, anger, cold and calculating behavior, and finally, violence. Sorry, but this is a line that should never, <i>ever</i> be crossed. Ever. Attacking your partner can <i>never</i> be excused or justified; let alone considered 'cute' or 'sexy.' Hermione didn't throw a bread roll at him and say ""Oh, Ronald."" She went for pain and blood. He hurt her, and she wanted her pound of flesh.  And while she did it, we were supposed to stand back as say, ""Awww.""

<P>It's perfectly fine if others disagree. I won't whine because everyone doesn't think like me, but at least have the courtesy to acknowledge that our ""issues"" with HBP went beyond one aspect or sub-plot. Even if you liked the romances as they were written (many seemed to - though I've heard from lots of people, from all ships, who were just as confused by the changes), please understand one thing: That will never be my ship, and I don't deserve to be ridiculed for wanting more out of a love story.

<P>Besides, JKR may have always envisioned R/Hr, but H/Hr <i>is</i> canon. Otherwise, she could have pulled off R/Hr and H/G while still being true to the characters. That she had to destroy Hermione and reinvent Ginny to pull off the ships is an anvil-sized clue that the author refuses to see.</lj-cut>"

"event","Well ain't that just the way.  I finally get a lunch buddy, someone at work to hang with and be cool around, and she's leaving me.  Well, leaving the state, but same difference. Don't you hate it when you finally get your department the way you want it (dorks, assholes, and poseurs all quit/get fired; cool peeps come in to replace them), then the precious balance of the cubicle eco-system gets upset, and chaos reigns once again: Will we hire someone new?  Scalp someone from another department (please god don't let it be that asswipe from Marketing!)?  Will I have to move to another desk? I don't like change!

<P>On to baseball:

<P>What the hell?!  A <i>10-day</i> suspention?  For pine tar?  Please.

<P>Now, baseball players have been cheating since... well... since baseballs have been round.  In fact, there is a well known saying that acknowledges this fact: <b>If it ain't cheating, it ain't baseball</b>.  That said, pitchers have been coming up with new, inventive, (and oftentimes disgusting) ways to grease a baseball.

<P>See, a greased baseball is slicker, so it comes off the fingers easier and faster, which gives you more speed (and sometimes a really wicked spin) on the ball. Hence the names <b>Greaseball</b> and <b>Spitball</b>.

What <i>my guy</i> did was use <i>pine tar</i>.  Pine tar is sticky.  It's used to help a pitcher <i>grip</i> the ball.  It doesn't add speed or spin. It adds control. Which is a good thing, especially if you're the batter and a small, round projectile is hurtling toward you at 90+ mph. You <i>want</i> the pitcher to have control over where the ball is going.

<P>When you watch a baseball game and you see the pitcher bend over and fondle the little white bag (usually right before he bends over and fondles himself [god I love baseball!]), he's using a resin bag to dry his hand before he throws the next pitch. Bowlers do it, gymnists do it; hell, people even use resin on pool sticks. This is not illegal.  What is (technically) illegal, is having a substance on your glove.  This rule is in place because all kinds of nifty things have been found on or in pitchers' gloves (i.e., Vaseline, sandpaper, baby oil, corn oil, etc.) - things that <i>grease</i> the ball.

<P>So you're probably saying to yourself, ""Well, rules are rules, and they <i>should</i> be enforced. It's only fair.""  Thing is, my guy is getting a 10-day suspension when other pitchers, <b>who were actually greasing the ball</b>, got either two days, or eight.

<P>God I hate baseball!!"

"event","I'm going to have a very comfortable retirement.  I will live in a posh house, with a big backyard, and a 3-car garage; which I will need because I'll have a new car every two years.

<P>How will I afford this, you ask?  Ummm... hard work, thriftiness, and sound investments?  Aw <i>hell</i> no.  See, my kids are white-collar criminals.  And everyone knows that white-collar crime pays the best.

<P>Yes, my little hooligans, at the tender ages of nine and ten, have committed their first act of Credit Card Fraud.  Mommy is so proud.

<P>Here's the story.  My kids are obsessed with BattleOn.  They've been playing it for over a year now and, several months ago, my son asked me to upgrade his account to Guardian Level (new weapons, armor, perks, yadda).  So I gave in.  I didn't upgrade my daughter because I figured that she could just log in on her brother's account whenever she wanted to feast on the Guardian love.

<P>Apparently this wasn't good enough because they got my mother's debit card and used it to buy a membership upgrade.  It was my daughter's idea (You Go, Girl!) but my son was the one who figured out how to make the purchase.  (And yet he's only pulling down C's in school.  Go figure.)

<P>Anywho.  We found out, went ballistic, threatened to call the police and ban them from the computer for life; the usual.  After everyone had calmed down some, we had a good talk and it turns out that, even though they knew they shouldn't have used the card, they didn't know that they were essentially stealing money.  My son said that he thought it was like a Gift Card... and that Gift Cards were like free money.  He was shocked!  Shocked, I tell you!  So I spent the better part of an hour showing them how bank accounts, debit cards, and credit cards work.  And while they understand the value of a dollar, they are just starting to grasp the fact that dollars are hard to come by, and people don't like to just <i>give them away</i>.

<P>So, they are banned from the computer for a month (which will suck hard for them since school is out in a week), they've had to pay back the $15 for the upgrade, and they had to apologize to grandma for stealing.

<P>I'm thinking a summer place in Florida might be nice..."

"event","<P>So I've been wanting an Angels cap forever.  I'm not one to walk around wearing ballcaps - being a <i>chick</i> and all - but I've got to take the dog for walks on the levy, rain or shine, and many times I've wished for a ballcap.  And I love sports gear!!!  Perfect match, no?

<P>Umm... well no, because I don't make $1,000 a week, which is the minimum needed if you want to buy your team's gear.

<P>WTF?  Why does it cost $21.99 for a hat?  Or $200 for a jersey?  ($150 if your team sucks ass.)

<P>I was in Big 5 the other day, and there it was.  An Angels cap.  Somewhere <i>other</i> than Orange County.

<P>Obviously a mis-ship. [/saracsm])

<P>And the price?  A mere (and vastly more reasonable) $6.
Six dollars.
Yes, $5.99 plus tax.

<P>And the only difference between this cap, and an 'official' one from the team website?  The lack of an MLB logo.

<P>Ha! ROFLMAO!  Ah hahahahahahaha!

<P>Fuck the MLB!

<P>Is this supposed to be a deterent from paying a <i>reasonable</i> price for gear???  Bitch please.  If there was an MLB logo on my beloved Angels cap I'd rip the fucking thing off and burn it during a Satanic mass while sticking pins in my Bud Selig voodoo doll.

<P>Did I mention 'fuck the MLB'?

<P>I'm going to go stroke my hat now..."

"event","<b>The Bickering Couple (and why R/Hr ain't it)</b>

<P>So their bickering is all just fun and games. A mere side effect of a building, and as yet, unresolved sexual tension. The screaming matches and harsh words, the biting comments and stretches of not speaking to each other, the lack of empathy or concern for the other's goals, values and fears is really just a ruse. It is simply how two inexperienced teens deal with the ""real"" feelings they have for each other.

<P>Sorry, but I disagree. I think that with Ron and Hermione, what you see (or read) really is what you get. We are all familiar with (and mostly entertained by) the classic Bickering Couple (B/C). From Kate and Petrucio in Taming of the Shrew (and for that matter, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in the <i>filming</i> of Taming of the Shrew) to Shannon and Boone from Lost, the B/C is so commonplace in literature, film, and T.V., that we've come to expect that it must always be there. (Who will deny that you can tell which characters are going to get together simply by the way they argue with each other?)

<P>So what makes a true B/C and how do R/Hr differ from the pattern?

<P>First and foremost, in a real B/C dynamic, the ""fights"" are meant to be fun and stimulating for <i>both</i> people involved. The pair must also have some understanding of the rules of the game. They know where the boundaries are; how far they can push each other, what is off limits, and what could be considered mean or in poor taste.

<P>As such, the ""fights"" are more like teasing. More often than not, the language is rather tame, because the object is to get a rise out of the other person, not to actually hurt them. The encounters are never vicious attacks, and low blows are not allowed.

<P>A true B/C must fight <u>fair and know when to stop</u>. Often times, a ""fight"" will start, but when one person realizes that the other is genuinely upset, the teasing stops and the characters will often have a moment of true compassion and understanding - which (eventually) leads to ""resolving"" the unresolved sexual tension... closely followed by a boring storyline and cancellation. :P  

<P>So what is it that allows a pair of characters to have this type of relationship? What allows some couples to carry on the B/C dynamic? To seemingly step into a world all their own, separate from everyone around them as they do their linguistic tango while the other characters are merely spectators to the action?

<P>There <b>has</b> to be a similarity in personality and style that allows for a ""partnership"" within the bickering. It takes two to tango and the pair involved <u>are always equals</u>. They are intellectually matched and usually have the same style of humor (i.e., sarcastic, dry, acerbic, etc.) Otherwise, only one of the pair knows that it is teasing while the other may actually believe that it is a fight. Or worse, the other is unable to fight back at all.
<i>""Never engage in a battle of wits with an unarmed person."" -- Mark Twain</i>

<P>Does any of the above sound like R/Hr? For an author who is a master of plot development, and who has carefully researched names, mythology, and literature; are we to believe that JKR doesn't understand, or is incapable of writing, the B/C dynamic? I think the better explanation is that she just isn't trying to go there with Ron and Hermione.

<P>Ron and Hermione don't bicker or tease; they fight. And when they fight, it is a no-holds-barred, last-man-standing battle. After a row, neither are left with a ""buzz"" or sense of excitement from the confrontation, rather they are usually more upset and ill-tempered then before it; and instead of resolving anything, or building toward some type of climax, they end up not speaking to each other for hours or days.

<P>When Ron and Hermione fight, they are rude, hurtful, stubborn, emotional, childish, and unreasonable with each other. Some people wonder why they are friends at all.

<P>I don't.

<P>Their confrontations aren't a smokescreen for hidden feelings, because when they fight, they hide nothing from each other. Ron is insecure about his abilities both academically and as a wizard. Hermione is insecure about her looks and her worthiness as a friend and (muggleborn) witch. Both are deathly afraid for Harry. And often, they take these things out on each other.

<P>Friends yell at each other, say hateful things, and unfairly take out their frustration on each other. But the mark of friendship isn't the absence of fighting; it's being able to forgive each other afterward - something that Ron and Hermione have always managed to do. Many say that Ron and Hermione are obvious. They're right. Not all fighting is flirting, and sometimes friends just disagree."

"event","<P>It's a good time to be an Angels fan. I never thought I'd say that.  I doubt any Angels fan had even <i>dared</i> to dream it, but here we are.  We're at the top of the AL West (barely) and are supposedly the team to beat this year.  Again.
<P>None of this makes up for the fact that they changed the god damn name of the team to the Los Angels Angels of Anaheim.  Holy Christ!  It's the first real slip up that Art Moreno has made.  As if we <i>want</i> to be associated with L.A.?!  It's beyond lame.  If Art wants to expand the market, then win a Championship. (Oh wait... we <i>did</i> that already.)  Or better yet, go back to the original name: The California Angels.
<P>Still, I'm happy that we're doing so well, but... is it just me or is it hard to stay enthused when so many of the players have changed?  I watched the championship season avidly; and the season after, when nearly the entire team remained intacted.  But then, they got rid of Troy Gloss and Scott Spezio and it was the begining of the end for me.  Now Ekcs is gone and Salmon might as well be, and it just makes me sad.  I get that it's the transient nature of professional sports; but we live and die by these guys and their slumps and streaks and stats.  When they leave, it hurts a little.  And you <i>want</i> to like the new guys, but it takes time.
<P>That and the fact that George Steinbrener's evil twin, Bud Selig, is continuing in his never-ending quest to squeeze every last cent from baseball fans everywhere.  Fucker.  And I'm not even talking about rising ticket prices (Art <i>lowered</i> prices to get fans back into the Big A).  I'm talking about $14.95 a year to listen to games.  You can hear football games for free.  Two years ago, it only cost you $9.95 if all you wanted was access to <i>your</i> team's games.  Bud took away that option the very next year so now, it's full price or nothing.  You can't tell me the price of streaming something that is already being broadcast for free has gone up.  God, I hate Selig!
<P>God, I love baseball!  Go Angels!!"

<P>This reminds me of the time I became on ordained minister. All I did was click a link, and next thing I know I'm able to perform marriages.</P>
<P>So I'm over at my friend's lj, and I decide to register cuz I wanted to be able to post comments with my name (a niffy little idea since I never remember to actually <EM>sign</EM> my name), and BLAM! I got me a live journal. What next; my own web page?! *scoffs at the riduculous notion*</P>
<P>And the best part? Someone already had my chosen screen name so none of my friends with journals will know who the hell I am. Fuck me.</P>
<P>And now?? Now I have an lj to babysit. This reminds of the time I got an online pet. I started to hate it after a week, but felt too guilty to let it die so I 'fed' it for months, then spent weeks trying to get someone to adopt the fucking thing.</P>
<P>And so it begins...</P>"

My mother tried calling the house shortly after father had left. She told me that my apointment for the doctor's is for today. I'm leaving soon. I'll edit with the details when I get back later.

Edit::: So the doctor took more X-Rays today. He said he'd call my new house number with rusults.

Edit2::: Unfortunatly, My rib's are still broken for some reason. The doctor and that I can't get into fights or do any lifting or things like that. 

I'm going to Lyndon's club thing tonight. If I can find Amou's number, then I'm gonna call him up, and see if he wants to go."

"event","My father came by the house. Lyndon and Myle weren't home. I don't know why but I opened the door to him. He seemed odd, and smelt like alcohol. I knew he'd been drinking again. 

I moved out of the way, and he came in. He closed the door behind him and locked it. I went to the living room. He told me that my doctor called him. That I have to go back into the hospital and get more X-Rays to see if my ribs are healed. He started mumbling some words, well rather curse words. He told me that I was such a disgrace. That I cost him too much money. 

I guess it is my fault. My fault that he hit me. My fault that he's the one that hurt me. 

Some time passed by, and Myle was supposed to be home. But as usual he wasn't. I wanted someone to come home to get him away from me. No one showed. The my father pulled something out of his coat, and it was another beer bottle. He started drinking more. I didn't say anything about it though. Then He snapped. He threw it at me. It smashed at the wall behind me. He got up and left. I ran to the door, and locked it. 

Thats all for now. I'll update later."

"event","I can't fucking believe them at all.

I told my father that I was gay, and he flipped out at me. 

He grabbed me by the arm, and shook me around. He then threw me backwards, and I hit the wall. Then he picked up things, and threw them at me. Some of the things were a vase full of water and plants, the tv remote, and a candle. 

My brother Lyndon was home when I told them. He shoved my father out of the way, and brought me to the hospital. 

2 broken ribs
fracture in the arm
and stitches in the head. 

I'm now living with Lyndon and Myles."

I think I'll eventually tell them though. I'm scared to though. Maybe I'll talk to my brothers about it. I dont' know."

"event","My private school days are now over. I asked to take all final exams early, and I passed them all. So next year, it is a definate that I will be going to public school.

I went to the mall again. This time, I didn't steal anything. I felt bad from the last time. 

I went to get a bite to eat at the food court there. AND THE BEST THING HAPPENED!

A nice guy about 15/16 came over, and sat down at my table. We talked about a few things. He told me he was gay. It was the first time I met someone that liked the same sex. He was really nice. After we got done talking, it was like 7 at night. I called for my ride, and the guy waited outside with me. That when we sat down at the curb, and he kissed me. I liked it. I admit, he caught me off guard, but I didn't stop him. But I kissed him again. 

Sadly enough my mother called and told me that she was just turning the corner and would be here shortly. 

So the guy walked off, but said he'd be back again tomorrow."

"event","So it's been a few days since I last updated. Lyndon is now a full time bartender. He loves it. I'm happy for him. Mom says that he'll do good as long as he tries. 

I went out and headed to the mall. I 'shopped' around for a few things. It was amazing. It was such a rush. Who knew it would be so fun.

"event","So this is my first online journal. I thought these things would be kinda sketchy and all. But everything's worth a try atleast once, you know. 

Aside from that. 

My older brother Lyndon got the job of his dreams. He now works for a club doing various things, from being a bouncer, to mixing drinks. He wants to just be a full time bartender, but he's new so, they want to watch him for the time being.

School is almost over for the year. Private school sucks. Can't wait til next year. Then I'm going to Public schooling."

"event","There isn't much that I really feel like talking about right now, but I feel the need to post something. I don't really know what is going on these days. I am doing a little better than with my last post, but I still feel stuck in a rut. I want to see the future. I would love to see what would happen if I do this, or that. Seeing the end result of some major choice would help me feel like actually making it, whether it turned out the way I want or not.

I am spending way too much time on things that don't really matter. Guild Wars for example, I have spent over five hours total on it today and I really haven't gotten anything really worth five hours from it. I enjoy it and love playing it, but I still feel like I am obtaining nothing from it. I really want to do something different, but I just can't figure out what."

<br>
I know I said I would be posting my top 10 list for 2005 soon, and I really meant to, but I kind of got distracted by a shiny new toy. The toy is called <a href=""http://www.serioussam2.com/"" title=""Serious Sam 2"">Serious Sam 2</a> and I love it! Any time I sit down to get on the net I end up playing that game instead of actually doing what I had planned to do, such as post on my journal or work on my website layout. I know most of you don't really care about my list, but I said I would do it and I will. I want to really put some thought into it so I wont try to do it tonight since it is already late, but tomorrow I will have time to do it so I will hide my game cd and force myself to write.<br>
<br>
In case any of you didn't know, <a href=""http://www.derekwebb.com"" title=""Derek Webb"">Derek Webb</a> has released a new cd called <i><a href=""http://www.derekwebb.com/news/article/12"" title=""Mockingbird Releases"">Mockingbird</a></i> and you can buy it at <a href=""http://www.grassrootsmusic.com/artist/webb/webb6"">Grassroots Music</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000CC3SEG/ref=ase_pinnixnet-20/104-9998480-9191157?v=glance&s=music"">Amazon.com</a>, and on the <a href=""http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=110026302&s=143441"">iTunes Music Store</a>. I think this album may be Derek's best work yet, and I recommend it to everyone."

"event","<div align=""justify"">Well, this week marks the end of 2005 and it still doesn't feel like a year has gone by. This year has been one marked with changes in my life unlike any other year in my life. I've passed the 25 year old mark and I'm closing in on 30. I can't believe how different things actually are right now compared to exactly a year ago. I am spending time doing things somewhat meaningful with people I care about and I love it. The past twelve months have gone by fast, but the last three months really have flown by faster than anything.<br>
<br>
Slidell is still feeling the hurricane, many parts of town are still in disarray and without power. I can't believe I used to complain about how this town sucks so much and there isn't anything to do, and now that all my regular haunts are now closing earlier than normal I see how much I love this place and how much I miss it when I can't go where I want. Starbucks now closes at 6pm rather than their old 11pm time, sitting outside and smoking from 8pm till the kicked us out was one of my favourite things to do and now going when the sun is still up seems so awkward.<br>
<br>
Well, I guess that is enough rambling for now. I will post a top 10 list of 2005 sometime later today. g'night!</div>"

"event","Wow, for the past few days all the music I've been playing seems to be a few years old. Everything from Belle & Sebastial to Stereolab to Interpol. Why do I connect music with certain times of the year and then in turn connect certain times of the year to old memories? Lately many old things have been flooding back into my memory, things that I regret, things that I love, and things that really make me feel old. People have also been flooding back into my life from the past, people who I really thought I would never hear from again. well that's enough for this vague and stupid ramble."

"event","I've been updating my comic book collection database since the hurricane hit and it's becoming very boring. Having a decently sized collection provides a very tedious job of cataloging each comic book. I had been taking my time since I really didn't have to worry about adding many more books untill now since my store is getting a new shipment of comics that will end up with me bringing home around 90 new comics so I want to have the ones I already own done before that happens and I'm only about halfway through.

Even though I have a <a href=""http://www.collectorz.com/comic/"" title=""Collectorz.com Comic Collector"" target=""_blank"">program specifically made</a> for doing this it still ends up being a pain. I have been having to go back and edit little bits of data for back issues each time I add a new issue in order because I did something stupid like misspell the name or had it listed as a miniseries of 5 instead of 8 or something dumb like that. I really shouldn't complain about doing this since I don't actually have to do this, but I really want a database of all the comics I have so I can then go back and see what comics I've missed during the time my store has been close and also to help me in the long run to fill in missing issues in long runs I have such as <a href=""http://www.marvel.com/publishing/showcomic.htm?id=4"" title=""The X-Men"" target=""_blank"">X-Men</a> and <a href=""http://www.dccomics.com/features/superman/"" title=""Superman"" target=""_blank"">Action Comics</a>.

I have to admit that I am very excited about actually getting in new comics and being able to go back to work finally, even if it is in my bosses garage."

"event","wow, this weekend has been rather dull aside from friday when I got to hang out with Ansley and buy some comics and play his X-Box. X-Men Legends 2 is such a great game, but it took me a bit of playing it to really get into it. The story of the game is pretty boring to me but the game play is REALLY fun. I enjoyed hanging out with Ansley, it's been a while since we've been able to spend this much time hanging out since he's been living in New Orleans while he's been in seminary. I hope to see skot again soon, but he's started back at school so his free time is rather limited again.

<abbr title=""My boss at the comic shop"">David</abbr> finally is getting in a shipment of comics this wednesday, and he got the order confirmation this weekend so I can see what we will be getting. It's been over 6 weeks since I last was able to get an entire weeks worth of comics since Hurricane Katrina came through and busted up the <a href=""http://www.magic-comics.com/"" title=""I work at Magic Comics & Hobbies"" target=""_blank"">shop</a>. We'll be selling comics from the workshop in his house that he converted from his garage a while back. I can't believe I will be going home with close to 90 comics this week when I am used to getting about 30 books a week. We're still not going to be caught up with all that we've missed, but hopefully I'll be able to pick up all that I've missed with some help from <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/"" title=""Money Suckers"" target=""_blank"">eBay</a>."

"event","Well, here I am. Sitting in Houston at a friends computer wondering when I'll be able to go back home. Me and my family live in Slidell, LA and the hurricane went right over our city. We left sunday morning to go to a small town about an hour northwest of Baton Rouge to stay through the storm. We were lucky enough to only lose power for about 5 hours on monday. Tuesday we left that town and made our way back to Slidell taking back road highways to make it back to our house. Our house had weathered the storm nearly without a scratch, other than one back corner of the roof that got glanced by a tree, and many other trees that fell without hitting the house at all. So now we are here in Houston since my mother is in need of a checkup for her cancer and our house was without power. I am hoping that we will hear very soon about when we will be allowed back in Slidell, but until then I am thankful that we were able to make it through without any real loss so that we will be able to help others more. I hope none of you were worried about me and I thank you for any prayers you prayed for us.

ps. If any of you would like to talk or something post your phone number in a private reply and I'll call you very soon. thanks."

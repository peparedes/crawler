"event","I'm going to start from the begining. A few weeks back I wrote something on Lj about my old roommate and his mother. I spoke the truth about them. Her son does nothing but sit on the computer all day and gets away with anything that he wants. She spent about $13,000 on college and graduated in May. She went to school for Medical Billing and Coding. Well that is a very demanding job these days. Well she hasn't looked for a job since and I wrote that in my journal. Well first off it's MY journal and I can use it to vent if I want. It's no one else's business what is said in there. Anyway .... this journal entry of his was brought to my old roommates attention by someone who is known as a backstabber. Austine warned me not to trust this person but I made the choice not to listen to her. So I got kicked out of where I was living. Well another person moved in the next day and both of these kids took all of my stuff [which included things of Austine's and things for the baby] and left it on the back porch of my old residence and told me to come get it before Thursday otherwise it was going to be garbage. Well two of my friends and I went and got my stuff and put it at a secure location. Since this has been going on the kid who recently moved in has been threating me saying that he is going to kick my ass. Well Austine being 35/36 weeks pregnant didn't want nor need this stress in her life so she went to someone who is like an older brother to this person. She talked to him and asked him if he could straighten it out. She would of done it herself but with her temper it would of ended up with her screaming and she really didn't want that. She wanted the drama to end. Well her friend responded to my message on myspace and told her that he would talk to him tonight. Over the past few days my ex-roommate has been threatening my. Now neither one of us really pay attention nor care about it because well it's coming from someone who has no signifigance in our lives. Tonight he took it too far. Well the three of us get down to the Q and we start hearing all this bullshit. I heard that I was supposed to be jumped by quite a few people. Honestly they are stupid to bring that shit down to the Q when everyone knows that the cops patrole that area now. But I wasn't gonna let tha bullshit bother me. Well I had some people come tell me that someone was going to jump me. But Austine heard my ex-roommate was on his way down pissed off and what not. Didn't really care. Well a third party person was involved and my friend who was suppose to talk to someone for me tryed to straighten shit out. None of us want to see the Q get shut down or anything like that. Well I walked away like a man and my ex-roommate walked away pissed. We knew something bad was going to happen. We just felt it. Not to mention Edy pointed out to me how he was walking away. Well they leave and what not or just disappear ... I don't know and don't care I just know that he was no longer there. Well me and my boy were offered to go play a game of pool with some of these guys. So my boy and I were playing pool and Austine was outside and just walking around and talking to people. Well the undercover cops pull up in the maroon taurus telling everyone to get inside or leave. She noticed that the two undercovers walked in behind her. But my sister told me that they were there and so did Austine. And I told them said jokingly ""watch them be here for me"". Tha Sad thing is they were there for me. Well everyone knows that I carry a blade on me so you know but i was about to take my shot and one of the Undercovers tapped me on the shoulder and asked me what my name is and of course I Said ""David Holden"" then they asked me if I had a Knife on me and i admited that I did. So they yanked my left arm behind my back then the other and literally shoved me outside while and this whole time I was being cooperative. and they slapped the cuffs on me, emptied my pockets, and then slammed me onto the curb to sit down. And then when Austine got outta the bathroom she had like ten people say ""Dave just got taken out in handcuffs!"". And I see her outside so She trys to come see me and the UC rudely yells at her to go inside and here I trying to tell the officers that she's my fiancee` and that she's pregnant with my child. Well let me tell you .... these officers were assholes!!. Well they told everyone to go inside or they will be arrested and all she knew was that I was in handcuffs. She started to flip out. Come to find out that when the drama was suppose to be dropped my ex-roommate or someone she was with tonight called the police saying that I threatened to stab my ex-roommates mother. Now first off why would I do that when I have a baby due anyday now and I'm trying to get into The National Guard?! Second off we have so much proof of who did, it's not funny. Lets just say people know who did it and that's all that matters. Tonight was a hell of a night.

"event","<center><b>Friday night Austine broke up with me at her house tha exact night after she told me that she still loved her ex-b/f Nick that fuckin' fag. So I had my father pick me up and bring me to Travis' his mom told me that I still had a bed there so i'm living with Travis again. Then later on I called Greg up (Amanda's new man) to clear tha beef between us and then 10 minutes later they came over and chilled with me and Travis. Since Amanda is afraid of clowns Greg and I kept picking on her about it lol. I drew a clown on a piece of paper and handed it to her then she ripped it up and started tickleing tha shit outta me she knows how tickleish I am. Her and Greg both started wrestling on tha couch and he wasnt letting her win till tha last two times it was great chillin with them again. Then Kat and Devin called me and told me that Austine was at tha Q with Nick so I got my ass down there in less than 5 minutes and tha Q-club is like a mile away and so I bitched at Austine and what made it funny was that Nick didnt do shit since he's tha same guy who threatened to put a bullett in my head a few months back!!! Well I g2g and do shit I'll update later!!!

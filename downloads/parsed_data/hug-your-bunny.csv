"event","i never knew there existed in my body a bright (almost neon) yellow substance that lives in my lungs.
they gave me robitussin with codine.  may cause drowsiness...use care using machines.  may cause dizziness.  do not drink alcoholic beverages.  taking too much may cause breathing problems.  take with plenty of water.
there goes my night of drinking pbr and driving my forklift.
i've concluded that people not only suck at driving, but also walking.
fat cat piggy bank, i love you.

i wonder if i'm supposed to feel like this."

"event","our hoofty neighbor next door asked lou if he would want to jam in his attic sometime.  that was kind of creepy.
if anyone asks you or your friend's band to play for a benefit at lehigh valley college, don't do it, it'll be lame.  even after you get the alcohol.
my kitty is getting his little nuts chopped off today and declawed, all the best little kitty, now you won't fuck up all my shit (including most of my forearms) when you decide to bust out your large talons.  that's what happens when you make me bleed.
hopefully, i'll get my printer/scanner/copier working soon.  then i can get pictures.  many many pictures."

"event","MY day, part 1:
The last week I was very bored, sleepy and depressive (big sorry to Susi and Evi, I know I can get quite complicated), but today it got better (after P.E). We have heard our geramn-teacher speaking for the first time in English and I nearly died laughing (Evi, you've missed something).

MY day, part 2:
Fuck, I've spained my ankle again (the last time is 6 weeks ago)during badminton. It doesn't hurt, but it is swollen and looks badly. Fuck!!!

MY day, part 3:
Why do I have to have such an old DVD-Player on my computer...."

"event","Susi, I did the test...two times...

Vampire - don't fear because you got vampire...vampires are beautiful, intelligent and gifted. They may well be hard to fit in with at first, but once you earn their friendship they are a loyal and honourable bunch. You believe in courage and hardwork and that everyone should work for themselves and lead, rather than follow. You are original, inventive and a true friend, vampires rock! 

 
Elf - elves are beautiful, serene and enchanting. They are not always the one standing up performing but they seem to get the limelight even when they do not wish it. Elves tend to be quiet and daydreaming, off in their own world and paying little attention to things happening around them. It may take a time to earn their full trust or grab their complete attention, but when you have it, you'll never as a good as a friend again, the best way to describe elves is 'best friend'. You can always rely on them in a time of need and they always put others in front of themselves. It can be lonely though, because although they are naturally popular within friends, they never feel like anyone is like them, which they generally accept. Elves are enchanting to all, even if people don't realise it, people are drawn to you because of your sweet nature. Elves are amazing. 

...these two don't fit together... what am I?"

"event","That was the worst day of the week. When I stand up, I was wide-awaken. I wanted to go to the bathroom to brush my teeth, but my brother blocked it for 15 minutes and I got a bad mood.
45 minutes later, when I entered the school-building, I got very tired and nearly fell asleep while physics.
Two hours later, our chemistry teacher handed out an test... that was very bad, I think I screwed up. The best thing is that I have actually known everything.
During the 5th lesson we had a replacement lesson. That sounds good at first, but we had to work. *groan*
In Biology our teacher told us that he wanted to write a test, but then he noticed that this was impossible today, so he decided to write a chemistry test (our biology teacher is also our chemistry teacher). NOw the best thing of all: I knew the right answer to every question on the paper! Bad, bad luck today!
Economics was boring as always and when Evi and I went to our lockers and she said that I couldn't have another incident with destiny before I leave the building, the opposite happened.
Really bad day today.

"event","hello fans. I am back to posting one more time.  I keep forgetting about this site and thus why i havent been writing to you. I apologize from the bottom of my heart. I hope none of you have left me and no longer wish to read about my exhilarating life in Charleston Illinois. 
 So for todays docket I am sitting in my Theatre History class as i usually am on such a morning as this.  We had to have a play read by today so we could aid the person doing the dicussion and I failed to read the play. Not a new thing for me sadly.  
 I had a dream last night that i had already gone to my disney job but Kristen was sick and it was strange and then i wanted to visit all of these places but we couldnt get there for some reason or another. It was strange. I definately was very distraught.  
 SO this week is Satyr week for our fraternity and I am rushing APO. Woo me.  I think this whole week is a joke. It is all very silly and I do not see the point. I dont know how in depth i will go to please these people, probably not very. I am in this to make friends not make a fool out of myself. And if they are going to not let me join for not doing a silly task then I dont want to be involved with this theatre at all.  Again i think it is silly but its required so ill do what i can.  Not looking forward to initiation. at all.  I think that is sillier than satyr week. i dont mind the monologue and stuff but the whole running around and doing stupid stuff. Not my thing. sorry.  I will not run if told to they can kiss my butt.  I am wearing my jacket inside out because it is inside out day but thats it.  I forgot to put my ribbon on this morning. well maybe i didnt necessarily ""forget"" but it was early. I looked at it and said no.  I dont mind giving back rubs, if everyone would be nice and make me give them a back rub then i would love this week because i love giving them and im good at it but no one will be nice and they will all want a silly award winning moment. STUPID!!! is the only word i have to say about it. now maybe this is just my shy self wanting to be rebelious because i do not want to do that in any way shape or form  but i dont want to do it and im pretty sure i have a few reasons which are good in my mind.  im being rebellious late in life, so sue me. DONT PUSH MY RIBBON IF I DO WEAR IT! i may bite your head off ,  dont test me this week people, not a  good week to push a girl if you get my drift.
 oh gosh, i have 4 monologues to memorize, and the third act of a play which has alot of cut off sentences between me and the only other character in it. SUCKS!!!!  i cannot wait until i have no more homework.  it will be so nice. just to come home and be able to read or just sleep.  I do have a paper that was due last month that i have not started yet and i dont know when i will. papers are not my forte. cant do research papers. at all.  le sigh. well i think i have said enough haha i will stop for now and write again when i remember!  thank  you   thank you  until we meet again!"

"event","i'm in my theatre history class again.  woo much fun.  not really haha. i kinda wish i was in the costume shop sewing up Baileys dress for Brighton.  I am almost done with it and im excited.   I put the skirt to the  bodice yesterday as well as putting the zipper in.  woot!
  i really need to get my act together or i am going to be hurting come the next few weeks.  im still stuck with the whole procrastination thing.  cant get past it. le sigh.
  I am officially rushing APO spring of 09. I sent in my leter of intent and they approved it Sunday.  I am very excited because i love everyone in APO and i want to become better friends with them! I think it is going to be alot of fun as long as i keep my mind open.
  Directing is going to kick my big butt if i don't get my butt in motion and work on crap as well as theatre history. I have a 7 page draft due next Thursday and i haven't even started at all. I had my first meeting with him Wednesday.  sigh sigh sigh.
  I am doing props for Brighton Beach Memoirs and the director asked me last night if i could have the props ready for the Sunday performance at 7 pm.  so either i have to set up the props before and come back for after church or miss church.  and i am highly opposed to missing church. ill figure it out.  But i am extremely excited about this play. I like when i get to help with plays. I get to know people better and i like when people depend on me. i love doing things for people. LOVE IT! haha.   I also get to go antique shopping with one of my teachers Nick Shaw Friday. WOOT!
  My friend Kristen went to church with me last night and i am so excited. I really hope she continues to come to church with me. Yes it is different for her because we don't use instrumental music  but that's because the bible doesn't authorize it.
  So i am going to direct a play this summer by myself.  I am the director not just helping. Its my baby!  I am doing Alice in Wonderland. I cannot wait to get on with it and get things in motion.  The first thing i have to do is a budget list for the theatre im working it at and i don't remember how to do it haha. I should have listened bit i didn't. its my fault.  i am going to ask Nick Shaw if he can help me figure it out. So excited! i need ot make sure that i put fliers up at school before i go so people here can come. yay me!
  Well i need to get other stuff done and actually pay attention. peace love and bacon grease!"

"event","so. i am at home. and i want to stay here. dont get me wrong, i like school well the people at school but i would rather be home as im sure most any college kid feels.  
   I have a huge load on me this semester.  I have classes that are putting alot on me and i have to get props together for Brighton Beach, work in the costume shop, and i am directing a play this summer and i have to get everything set up for that too. stupid school. oh sigh.  I need summer now. yes my summer will be just as busy but its not school work.  
   I made a bracelet and a necklace today.  I had new wire so i figured i would try it out and make things.  I also messed around with my wire and making pretty designs.  fun stuff;
  Ok so i have a problem with procrastination.  I wait til the last second to do things. It has gotten so bad that i have been waiting to do my homework til the day it is due.  its really hurting me but i cant seem to get past it and beat this laziness. I am just as bad with my craft projects. I have had this one cross stitch project that i have been trying to get together for my drama teacher for the past two years. i cant seem to make myself sit down and work on it. hopefully i will finish it this year. *fingers crossed*
   I have this scrapbook that i want to put together for Viki Loomis. I want to get ahold of all the people she had as students that i know and if they know any body too, i want them to give me a story about her or just explain viki in your eyes or tell what she has done for you what she means to you and if you have any pics you want to contribute too.  The problem is i emailed a bunch of people and no one got back to me.  its very disheartening because she means so much to me and i know she does to so many others but they cant take half an hour to write down their part and mail it to me  or even email me as a last resort but i want hand written in their hand writting.  If you read this and know anyone who knows viki loomis  kick them and make them write! haha.  i am goign to try once more and if i dont get anything you wont be included.  thanks!
    i feel like writing tonight haha.  i really dont want to do my homework.  so i am joining the theatre fraternity at EIU. I hope it all goes well.   im not excited yet because i have so much to do but i just want to get it out of the way.
   Well i am going to go try and be productive.  peace love and bacon grease!"

"event","so I'm sitting in class and watching a play.  This particular play is written in some odd form of old English and its hard to understand when just reading. Almost impossible.  You have you read it out loud or see it. I was trying to read it and i couldn't get more than a page in before i had to stop.
  Today is going to be a great day.  I had a lot of homework last night but i didn't do much of it. My bad i know but i just have no concentration these days for anything.  I was going to span it out over the day today and get it finished but as the day goes on i find that everything i was fretting about isn't due today or at least not to the degree i thought. so exciting!!!
  i found out last Wednesday that i am the Prop Mistress for the current show of Brighton Beach at school. I am so excited. Its supposed to be Props from Hell but i will be OK with it. I have plenty of time and plenty of resources to use.  I will show them all what i can do and try not to let any of my other commitments behind or slack at them.
  So far school is going well. Its Tuesday of the third week already.  i am thinking seriously about joining our theater fraternity.  Alpha Psi Omega.  I have two weeks roughly to let Lizzy know so we will see  but as of right now i am almost 90 percent sure i am going to join because i want to make more friends and get paddles when i am involved in plays.  Exciting!
 Well I'm in class so i should go and actually watch the play. i like old English but its hard to read is all I'm saying."

"event","wow it has been almost two years since i posted last. I used to use this site for a release of all my couped up feelings.  I have matured so much since high school in some areas and I also just dont have time to write anything in a journal anymore.  
  life is good right now.  I am at Eastern Illinois University and I am a theatre arts major.  I am currently in a play called Medea which actually opens this weekend and goes through tuesday. I am kinda getting tired of it cuz we keep doing it but it is a great play and im so excited to be involved in it.
  Classes are going well. I have alot to do for them because most of them are performance classes where i have to (get this) perform stuff. haha. 
  I miss being home. I want to be there so i can help at the culteral society.  I was there this whole summer and now i cant be there and its wierd.  Yes im still involved in the theatre here but it isnt the same.  Yes im friends with almost everyone here but they arent Viki or Dwight or Wes or Ranjani.  I miss my home friends.  But i am so grateful to have wonderful friends here who i will remain friends with!  
  Well i need to do stuff in my room .  maybe i can keep writing in here and keep this thing up to date even though i dont believe anyone will read it ever."

it feels so lonely out here
it feels so lonely inside

i can see you 
but not feel you
and you dont know i exist
dont worry i know what to do

i feel so invincible
all of the time
your words are so uncomprehensible
im going out of my mind

the lights have gone out
and im sitting all alone
it doesnt matter though
your true colors you've shown

im sitting right here
in the middle of everyone
but im not relaly here
not even to someone

i should be laughing
i should be having fun
smiling from ear to ear
just like the sun

but im not
and i think you know why
im so sad
i think i shall cry

goodbye cruel world
im giving you up
not again, my life,
will you ever tear up



well pep band was fun tonight woohoo great times.  yeah right  wow i hate feeling like this but as i say im putting it behind im starting anew good for me i hope if it works  woohoo here we go.  wish me luck  i wanna write a happy poem for once..... thank you leah i feel welcome...."

maybe it was because  you have so much hair.
you always seemed so geltle and sweet, 
after one glance i wanted to meet,
i have watched you from afar,
i saw you in your little red car,
always so kind so gentle so meek,
your freindship i always wanteed to seek,
your usually crazy set apart from the rest,
but i always thought of you as the best,
lips so soft eyes of mystery,
smile so cute i like you, you see,
i dont really know what to do, 
but these are all the things that remind me of you.

but i guess its what you felt you had to do
ignore me all you want, I'll alwasy be around
you seem so simple but in the end so compound
you help me hand adn made me happy
made me giddy, made me sappy,
made me sad yet still glad
you were all i felt i had
i need you now and forever
but with the way you feel it will be never
with you i feel whole
without you i feel out of control
your touch so soft heart so gentle
when were apart i just go mental
i think a life without your touch
would leave me needing too much 
stay around give me a chance
maybe our love we could enhance
and if we end up apart
we will be friends til death do us part
the way you held me made my heart melt
comfort and closeness is what i felt
please hold me again
please let me in
weve shared so many times of joy
i hope you dont think that im just your toy
please dont just throw it away
we can make it stronger why not today
I love you i want  you i need you right now
i want to be with you  just tell me how?

why all this pain
all these feelings are stealing
 emotions i cant contain

my mind wonders too much
never on one thing it stays
no one can help me not even a touch
my mind is long gone it likes to play

depression is one thought that crosses my mind
could it be or is it just a thought?
myself is one thing its trying to find
that is the one thing, priceless, that cannot be bought

is this feeling normal or is it just me?
am i alright or am i insane?
all thse feelings are pushin to escape,to be free
I cant let them loose they cause too much pain

im so distracted, so lost and alone
i want to be free and among all the others
it will never happen so toss me a bone
its not meant to be, we'll never be together

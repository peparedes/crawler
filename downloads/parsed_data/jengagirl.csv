"event","Okay so I weighed in yesterday and I had gained 2.2 pounds in 3 weeks.  It was diappointing but kind of expected since I had a crazy schedule and had been eating whatever, whenever when I can get the chance to eat.  Then I went to the fair 2 times so that didn't help.  But what I realized is that little slips here and there start a downhill slide and you need to catch yourself before it gets bad.  So I need to get back on track.  Not with just what I'm eating but with everything.  I need to start focusing on myself again and get back into reading, and reading my scriptures, and keeping my house clean (well I'm a clean freak so really clean is what I should say) and spending more time with my puppies and all that stuff.  Now that my schedule is back to normal I will be able to do this :) I will take my aunt to the airport tomorrow morning really early so I'm gonna go to the gym right afterwards and exercise and tan before I would even normally think of waking up!!!  Depending on how many people are there I may make the early early time slot my normal gym slot.  I'll let you know after I go.  Okay.....here's to Jenifer!!!"

"event","Well, seeing as the three people on my list, made no suggestions like I asked, with exception of Crystal, I'm gonna go with her idea.&nbsp; I guess I'll just do an update post...

Well, I was kind of seeing a girl for a while, until she decided she wanted to date a guy she works with.&nbsp; We technically weren't dating, so I suppose I have no reason to complain.&nbsp; We did promise each other that if anything had changed we would let the other know.&nbsp; Apparently, pretty much ignoring someone for a couple weeks, then telling them you're with someone else through your myspace &quot;status,&quot; is telling them.&nbsp; Oh, and its not dishonest in any way.&nbsp; Ah well, such is life, it seems.&nbsp; We're friends of course.&nbsp; She's a cool chick.

I&nbsp;like my job at the moment.&nbsp; I'm a temp through Kelly Services, at Welch Allyn.&nbsp; It's pretty sweet.&nbsp; It's easy anyways.&nbsp; Sometime, so easy its boring.&nbsp; I can deal though, and we get a little bit of overtime here and there, when we want it.

I'm actually pretty sure of my whole college/living situation.&nbsp; I know I told some people (Niki and Josh), atleast at one point, of my plans to go to Nebraska.&nbsp; Well, I'm pretty much dead set on the idea now.&nbsp; It's one of the few schools I found, that offer my exact major.&nbsp; Ironically, one is in Pittsburgh, but I&nbsp;just feel the need for something new.&nbsp; Something far away, and different.&nbsp; So, I&nbsp;need to start putting away money, so I can pay some rent/move.&nbsp; Then I'll get myself back in school.&nbsp; I really want to do this, but I can't shake the idea that something will end up holding me back.&nbsp; I guess I just can't let it happen, because this is really what I want.&nbsp; I know, I&nbsp;know...&nbsp; Nebraska?&nbsp; &quot;There's nothing there!&quot;&nbsp; There's a lot there, there's the major I want, and there's the complete change of scenerey, I&nbsp;really feel I need.&nbsp; I'll miss my family and friends.&nbsp; Definitely my best friends' kids, all of them.&nbsp; I don't want to miss them growing up, but I really need to do something for me.&nbsp; If I stay in Auburn, the life will slowly be sucked out of me.&nbsp; I'm not exaggerating in saying that either.

Granted I like my job, I put in an application for another.&nbsp; Keep&nbsp; your fingers crossed for me, because I'd be making almost twice as much.&nbsp; It's similar work, probably more demanding, which wouldn't be a bad thing.&nbsp; I'm really hoping that I get it, for financial reasons, and because I like my easy job, but I don't like a job so easy, it literally puts me to sleep sometimes.

Well, I&nbsp;feel like this is enough of an update for now.&nbsp; For one, I'm getting distracted.&nbsp; Secondly, I should probably get some sleep so I don't sleep 'til the last minute before work tomorrow.&nbsp; G'night all."

"event","<p>Have you ever felt that you're so full of emotion, its just going to spill out of you at any moment?&nbsp; I'm not even sure how I'm feeling, I guess a little depressed.&nbsp; I just feel like there are about a million things I want to say in this post.&nbsp; Then, I'll finish it, and if I even choose to post it, I won't feel like I said anything I wanted/needed to.<br /><br />I keep thinking a lot lately, about love, I guess.&nbsp; I just feel so ridiculous for wanting something so badly.&nbsp; Especially something I can't just expect to fall in my lap, and who really knows if I've ever even had.&nbsp; Sure, in reality, that's basically how it happens, but there has to be some kind of starting point.&nbsp; A spark of interest, maybe?&nbsp; I know that ""I'm young, and that I haven't met the right person.""&nbsp; Thanks captain obvious, the world makes sense again.&nbsp; Seriously though?&nbsp; C'mon!&nbsp; I absolutely refuse to change anything about myself, unless by some of chance, it's something I feel there's a need to change.&nbsp; I'd say it took me around 20 years to figure out who I am.&nbsp; Sure, it's still in the works, but I'd say the blueprint is pretty much finalized.&nbsp; Sure, ""nice guys finish last,"" but not always, and when's it my turn?<br /><br />Ok, so I definitely started writing this post about 24 hours ago, and somehow it's still open, and unfinished.&nbsp; Enough bitching, haha.&nbsp; Let's just say my mood is currently much better.&nbsp; I was very anxietal last night, and it was WAY too quiet in the house.&nbsp; Which makes me soooo edgy.&nbsp; It probably didn't help that I was reading all these ""7 Gates of Hell"" posts, my friend Jess was sending me, about some place in York, PA.&nbsp; Supposedly, if you go through the seven gates, you end up in hell.&nbsp; A bunch of nonsense, but still cool to read about.&nbsp; It'd be even more cool to visit, but I know I'd just end up being ridiculously freaked out.&nbsp; I don't do well in woods at night as it is. lol<br /><br />I feel much better today, just had a super sweet mood swing last night, and was ridiculously depressed for a while, and super anxietal.&nbsp; All is good now though!&nbsp; I'm gonna wrap this up, without saying the ""million things"" I had to, because, now that my mood is better, I forgot!</p>"

"event","&nbsp;Niki, come home damn it!!&nbsp; I miss you, and really want someone to hang out with!

I decided to write in my journal, and actually post it for once.&nbsp; Rather than writing out an entry, then deciding I don't want people to read anything personal that I write.&nbsp; Besides, who really reads this anyway??&nbsp; Niki, at most.

I'm in a weird mood, and feel like I have 8 million things that I want to say, but I just don't know how to write them down.&nbsp; It's the weirdest feeling, I can't even rant at this point.

I was thinking, you know what really pisses me off, about my apparent inability to have a relationship?&nbsp; The fact that, I always end up being the one that's completely ignored.&nbsp; It's never the fact that my relationships have all sucked really, that makes me feel worthless, it's the fact that I'm basically completely forgotten in the long run.&nbsp; I guess this is hard for people to understand, but if I care about someone enough to want to date them, I sure as hell won't write them off.&nbsp; Anyone who knows me well, or atleast my two BEST friends, would be able to tell you, that I wouldn't let any feelings I have, get in the way of what could atleast be an amazing friendship.&nbsp; Hell, one of my best friends, I like for probably the first four years we knew eachother!&nbsp; Anyways...

I think I figured out what I'm gonna do.&nbsp; I think I'm going to apply at CCC, and Pitt.&nbsp; That way, I have both options, and if I can't make it to Pitt for the fall semester, I'll be there the semester after.&nbsp; I plan to go to get a teaching degree, so I can teach elemtentary/adolescent art, or maybe even highschool if I find a program that covers them all.&nbsp; So, that's the plan, and I'm actually gonna stick with it for once.&nbsp; Push me bitches! :-p"

"event","lately i havent seen much of the usuals :-\ juss the softball gurls, but i love them so its ok. i juss feel like im losing two of the most important people in my life cuz they're too busy for me. makes me feel like im unimportant actually. i guess thats juss what happens when we start growing up... you lose people you love.

and if anyone needs any clarification on who those two ppl are, its matt and cheeta. 

matt has a job now, so i can understand that... but he never calls anymore, never wants 2 juss chill... am i not good enuff?

cheeta's been in europe, and i was happy that she left cuz i think she needed that. but now i barely talk to her... its been a good 3 weeks since we had a real convo. and prom... well i wanted to spend that whole night with her but now she wants to get a house with erin instead of a hotel room with me... whatever guess its juss me and my date in hampton all weekend...

and then theres the boy sitch. the continuous soap opera in my life. well i miss someone. im not at liberty to say who, becuz im still not sure about it. i mean i miss him but i dont. i want his attention but i dont think i'll ever get it again, and i cant blame him for not looking my way. but at the same time i really wish he would. maybe i juss miss having someone to talk to, to hold hands with and to snuggle up with and watch a movie. i miss having someone. someone i can call my own and never think twice as to if he would be playing me. i trust this boy... for some strange reason...


i need to go tanning like whoa... time for a shower so i can shave up and then catch some (fake) rays..."

"event","why did everyne become so fake? i mean, not EVERYONE is, but most ppl are. maybe they always were and im juss realizing it. but then how could i have been so happy before? why cant i be happy now?

i guess its juss ludacris to think that i could leave and then come back and things would be all better again, juss like they were when i left.  but i guess you've died. or at least who you were has. But why, then, do i hang on like theres still something there? maybe cuz i see something there... a light thats been left on in your eyes.  but did you leave this light for me to find my way back to you? or was it juss an accident? or maybe im seeing things... juss imagining what i want to see? i need answers but im scared to ask the questions becuz im scared of the real answers. i've played the scenario over and over in my head and i can juss imagine how wonderful things were and it would be so easy to juss go back to that.

but then i realize im dreaming, becuz you arent there. and the only reason i can think of is that u juss dont care anymore. maybe i killed what we had... if thats true then lock me up and gimme the death penalty, cuz i deserve it. cuz i woulda killed one of the best, most amazing, incredible people i've ever met. i wanna go back to when things were heavenly, a ""utopia"" of ""euphoric"" feelings. the first note you ever wrote me u said i gave that to you. 

now im begging to be able to give that again. 

""Brenna, I love you, and the day that my love for you diminishes, will be the day that the universe stops existing... ""

looks like the universe juss stopped existing... 

why dont i feel like laughing ever again...? oh yea, becuz you said that was the first thing you ever noticed about e, the thing that u love the most.


theres a light in your eyes
thats too bright to see 
and a pain in my heart 
where you used to be 
was i wrong to assume 
you were waiting for me? 
theres a light in your eyes
did you leave that light burning for me?"

"event","ahhhh so its sunday... im actually excited for tomorrow. maybe cuz i get to talk to him everyday now. i wonder what he thinks of me...

I wont talk
I wont breathe
I wont move till you finally see
That you belong with me

You might think I dont look
But deep inside
In the corner of my mind
Im attached to you
Im weak
Its true
Cuz im afraid to know the answers
<b>Do you want me too?</b>
Cuz my heart keeps falling faster

I've waited all my life
To cross this line
To the only thing thats true
So I will not hide
Its time to try
Anything to be with you
All my life I've waited
This is true

<b>You dont know what you do
Everytime you walk into the room
Im afraid to move</b>
Im weak
Its true
Im just scared to know the ending 
<b>Do you see me too?
Do you even know you met me?</b>

I've waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing thats true
So I will not hide
Its time to try anything to be with you
All my life I've waited

This is true

I know when I go I'll be on my way to you
The way thats true

I've waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing thats true
So I will not hide
Its time to try anything to be with you
All my life I've waited

This is true...

sucha good song!

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, but there's just no one, no one like you
You are my only, my only one


for *you*..."

"event","ok definately feeling bitchy... im juss like rawr everyone go away. esp my family. WHOA do i wanna get rid of them today! im so frustrated with life. i hate school, i hate dumb people, i hate fake people, i hate confusing boys, i hate my house, i juss hate not being happy. it isnt like i feel bad for myself i juss get mad about this kinda shyt. i juss cant take it i really wanna like run away or juss kill myself or something. argh. 

yea and all the stupid ppl can read this and comment about how it sounds like a good idea, and i should go do that, and how im sucha stupid whore or whatever u choose to use, and how im juss leading matt on and teasing him and all this stupid shyt. go ahead and comment, becuz i could really use the pick me up ryte now. i juss read ur comments and remember that life isnt so bad cuz at least im not that stupid :-)


it really makes me mad, some of the choices you make. i try to be here, i really do. maybe im juss not good at it, and maybe im not doing it right but i really am trying. but no one can be there for someone who doesnt want them around. no one gets it. whatever.


i feel like im losing touch with all these essential ppl. i never see them anymore or talk to them. i miss you guys. u should know who you are...



Super Cheeta 17: because she knows id stab her in the face with a lamp shade if she did that


have yOu ever felt sO alOne that nOthinq makes sense, well thats hOw i feel rite nOw. i feel as if i'm facing everythinq by myself with nOthinq but tears and a [ f a k e ] smile


Ten years from now I may not remember what we did those nights or what made us laugh so hard but I will remember YOU were the one who was there...

 Sometimes I wonder if I have a sign on my back that says,""break my heart""

Men can only break your heart so many times before it finally shatters and you lose all hope

Why is it that girlz fall in love, that we cry we get hurt and it feels like we got kicked right in the stomach when he says goodbye? But when we say goodbye all of that happens to us again because all he's doing is walking away free and not caring at all.

the truth is u could slit my throat, and with my 1 last gasping breath i'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt

sometimes i wish i had saved the tears u made me cry so i could fucking drown u in them"

If u want my heart, you have to promise not to tear it apart. 'Cause my heart has been hurt a lot. And it always seems love is not sweet, like in dreams.  Something falls through... But I don't want that to happen to me and you

Hey there honeybee, Will you give me...sugar? And if you shake real cute, I might give you some sugar. I was doin' alright on my own, now I might just take you home, sugar...

When u fall into me, it feels so sweet, like dreaming. Press yourself into me. Let me feel your breathing. There's a voice in your heart, softly calling. Come to me you will see, just give in to this sweet temptation.

He was so hypnotic, staring inner beams of light. It was so mysterious, but something that I liked.. What you do to me I can't explain. You're so good, yeah, it's a gamble that I have to take. What am I supposed to do? Boy I can't deny it...



i dunno how much longer i can take this. i need to get the hell outta here, away from everyone (well, almost everyone) for a lil while... just a vacation. is this bad that i want this when school hasnt even started yet? but its weird. i wanna be the gurl you can never forget. and when im not there, i want you to miss me. is that wrong? becuz i really juss wanna be the gurl you never, ever forget... the one that made a difference, that changed something. do other ppl think these things? or am i alone on this one? maybe i just wanna be the gurl that got away that you feel compelled to chase after time and time again.... why cant i just be that elusive dream to you?"

im like pushing ppl away... esp everyone i've been close to lately... and i know im doing it but i cant seem to stop it. i put up this wall around me and i dont let anyone in, even if i wanna, cuz i dont wanna get hurt. and i guess thats how i've been lately. hurt. and pissed at a lot of ppl. and i really havent been showing it becuz im trying 2 get over it. im tired of the bullshyt i go thru. maybe its time i let you know how i feel. im really upset and i cant deal with it anymore. i hate this. i need to get away from everything. maybe i juss need to get ou the hell out of my life... maybe then i could finally be fucking happy. i dont know what you did to make me hate you so god damn much, but whatever it was, juss know i cant stand you ryte now, so watch your step. if you THINK that could apply to you, it prolly does.

moving on... i''ve come to the realization that i've been a real bitch lately. no, i mean more then normal, silly ppl. i juss think ppl feel taken for granted and feel ignored. please know, i dont love you any less then i ever have. i've been distant becuz i have things on my mind that i wasnt ready to admit to, but now i am. so please dont be shy or downsize me. i love you.

tonite im chilling with steven :-) this should be interesting. who knows what we'll do.... any suggestions? 


leave me comments, fools"

I think about your face, and how I fall into your eyes.
<bold>The outline that I trace, around the one that I call mine</bold>...
Time that called for space, unclear where you drew the line.
I don't need to solve this case, and I don't need to look behind...

i'll run away with you <b>B</b>y <b>M</b>y side...


If tomorrow never comes, I would want just one wish...
To kiss *your* quiet mouth, and trace *your* steps with my fingertips. 
And it's *you*... The light changes when *you're* in the room...

Can't you see? There's a feeling that's come over me.
Close my eyes... You're the only one that leave<b>S</b> me completely <b>B</b>reathless...
And *you* stood at my door with *your* hands on my waist
and *you* kissed me like you meant it. And I knew that you meant it... 

sorry, i know you think ur competition is stiff, but it really isnt... cuz i think your so <i>wonderful</i> :-)"

<h2>You Like Them One Way... Hung!</h2>
Oh my... You're a total size queen, where all your subjects are well hung<br>
Seven or eight inches may be enough for you, as long as the girth is there too<br>
And you know that ""Size Doesn't Matter"" was a phrase invented by small men<br>
And while size isn't the only thing that gets you off, you need it to be satisfied

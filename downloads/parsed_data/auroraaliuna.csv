But for those interested, life's been a bit shitty, still working on bankruptcy and struggling with power/rent/both from time to time. Colt's mom died in January while we were in a brief half-separation that we both knew wasn't even going to be temporary anyways. We had a couple ferrets, one died 2 months ago, got a third, then second of the original died a month ago. Finally ditched burger world for good, back at Wal-Mart making the same money working 4 days a week. So that's going good at least."

The artist Ramone designed it himself, he rocks(and he's hawt). He told me to keep breathing when he started, so I focused too much on breathing and nearly passed out lol. Apparently I breath a lot better when just simply chatting. The process didn't hurt nearly as much as I'd psyched myself up for, more of a vaguely annoying burn.. an addictive, vaguely annoying burn. Can't wait to get more."

"event","Well, my mother in law has already been in bad shape for.. well, longer than I've known her, but it's been getting even worse to the point she can hardly even take care of herself. And now just the other day she fell down some cement stairs and broke / seriously injured numerous parts of her body, particularly one ankle, and toes on the other foot. Being that she can't hardly take care of herself as it is, it puts her in a very critical situation. My wife was already planning to try and visit in September if we could afford it, but now we need to get her there as immediately as possible if we can. Unfortunately as most things like this happen, it's when money isn't so forgiving, so if anyone can help at all, even just well wishes would be appreciated. But if by chance anyone can actually help more than that, our paypal is <b>dragonsoft@hotmail.com</b> . Or if by chance anyone out there works for airlines and can provide cost assistance of some manner through that, might be even more helpful in the end.

I love timing too, after six years of waiting and postponing for various reasons, I finally got my first tattoo as a stress relief from work crap and a self-birthday present like A DAY before this happened. Hell, wifeypoo has gotten three since we got together three years ago. Figured I could allow myself to indulge for once finally. And then shit like this happens, makes me feel pretty salty and guilty about letting myself slip and spend money like that. *sigh* I'll post pictures of it when it's healed enough to photo well, for those interested. :/

"event","So, for a while I was working two jobs. I was still at my job overnights at Burger King. And I worked during days as a Cashier / Courtesy Clerk at Wal-Mart (cart bitch, or ""Certified CRT Cart Removal Technician as one manager liked to call it). I was going to switch to Wal-Mart and even officially quit BK for a few weeks during March, but after a while, decided that BK was still a better venue. Despite wanting desperately to be done with food service for years, I've invested too many years into the company specifically and general food service to switch ships now, when I still wouldn't be pursuing a career at Wal-Mart either. So I came back to BK at the end of March, turned in my two weeks notice at Wal-Mart, and eventually just outright quit one day. Aside from BK being more beneficial overall and more familiar, Wal-Mart just seemed too volatile. Not going to get into the politics specifically, but it just didn't seem remotely secure, cross the wrong person and they would literally create safety rules to get rid of you.

So anyways, back at BK, and got numerous raises as a result of coming back because they desperately needed me on nights again. Plus, since the previous main manager at nights screwed up and nearly got himself permanently back on his prison sentence, I've snagged the nighttime management position for myself. Know most of it already, do ""official"" training next week. Originally I did not want to put myself in management in this store because of some politics and the GM in general, I've decided it will work okay, and it will help me get by better until we are situated for me to go back to school, probably after Colt gets in some college time.

In other news, we FINALLY have a real apartment, all to ourselves. It's so fecking nice no longer having to share a bathroom and kitchen with 8 other units. Or having to worry that our neighbors will create up bullshit to try and get us evicted. Or having the landlord's wife make up bullshit lies to slander our name to other tenants. She told one tenant we burned down a trailer, after we'd vaguely mentioned, not even outright complained, that said tenant was smogging the hallway with pot smoke. Neither of us are outright against marijuana use, but I'm rather allergic to it, and some decency to fan it out a window when using it would be nice. But we didn't even actually complained, we merely mentioned it in passing while asking if lighting incense to help mask it would get us evicted(because we nearly were over a fucking candle two days prior). Anyways, again, so much bullshit I'm not going to go into all the details. It's over, thank god.

So, now I just need to get things rolling again on our bankruptcy. We need ink for our printer because the documents are in non-saving PDFs. And doing it from the library with only an hour a day access to their printer would take weeks, literally. Though, at this point I might just do it all by pen except the debtors list. I've been putting it off because of all the job and housing upheavals of late, but now that things are settling again, time to reopen that book. Hopefully we can get into the May hearing, or June at latest.

Colt got a Parakeet too, belated Christmas present. We can't really have any other pets here(that and no porch/yard are like the only downsides to new apt). Her name is Borealis or Bor-e for short. She's adorable, and already learning a few tricks. Colt takes her down the hall with her to check the mail now and then, she attacked the maintenance guy the other day, it was hilarious.  We were going to train her as an attack keet anyways, heh. We're hoping to get the birdy a companion next payday if we can swing it.

So, overall, most things are going fairly well right now. Now if I can just get a bit more social again online *coughlessworldofwarcrackcough* >.>"

"event","Copied from my DA post, some a bit repeated here as I've been less absent here, but a bit update still. Mostly that I have 2 jobs and am more officially seeking Bankruptcy.

Well, I haven't drawn much, if at all, for.. well, probably since the last time I updated DA. Life's been interesting, anything that could go wrong pretty much has. But on the other hand, I have my wife, as of 2 and a half years now, and we're mucking through it all. Still struggling with trans-issues, and with all our financial problems, wondering if I'll every even be able to persue help to make me feel whole. But life goes on, and I have support. I hope to be drawing a bit more again, have one work I plan on starting pretty quick here as a ""Christmas"" gift for my wifey, and I'm hoping if I can get past the blockade of self-criticism, that maybe I'll start drawing again regularly. I'm working two jobs right now, so time is limited for many things, BUT, on the other hand, drawing is something I can do during breaks at my jobs. We'll see, but hopefully even if art doesn't pick up much, I'll be around a bit more again. I miss a lot of people, and am needing to reestablishing connections.

Rough catch up, I've graduated with an Associates in Computer Information Systems: specializing in Programming.

We no longer have our cats, two left when we moved in with a friend in Indiana. We went from there to my mother-in-law's house, because of finances and hopes to help her and ourselves, which didn't really work.. at all. We left Twilight when we had no other choice than to make trail back to my hometown in Montana.

I'm now working two jobs, since Colt is medically unable to work. One is overnights at Burger King, and the other as a Courtesy Clerk(cart pusher) at Wal-Mart.

We're in the process of filing for bankruptcy because of our debts.. it won't kill all of them, but it should knock out the worst, and give us a fighting chance to recover at least. I can't convey the stress these unpaid bills weighs on my mind."

"event","Well, we've been staying in a nearly closet sized sleeper room for almost 3 months now. It'd be okay for just one person, but way too cramped for two. But, because it has a shared kitchen and bathroom with other units, it was only $300 a month with utilities paid, about the best deal one in financial straights can come up with around here on short notice. Got it through my mom's landlord that's known us for many years now, since she was in the process of moving into her new public housing apartment and we needed a place to stay. Well, there was one person here who everyone's been trying to get rid of for a year, rude, dirty, inconsiderate drunken slob. Finally he left, thank god, and we nabbed first dibs on his apartment. It was officially free as of last Wednesday.

Well, Thursday was my 25th birthday, so the day before as my birthday present from mom, she paid for Colt and I to go see Harry Potter 6. Fitting, since the book came out ON my 21st birthday while I was in Germany. We also had a picnic and watched my nephew play baseball(all off little sleep x.x), so we missed the landlord trying to catch us that day to talk about moving apartments and giving us the key. We called on my birthday, which I had thankfully negotiated that night off at nearly the last minute earlier that week, I was going to need it.

Because apparently our ""not yet old"" apartment was already listed, and by the time we talked to her she gave us 24 hours to move or be evicted. Happy Birthday to me. I spent the entire day of my birthday and most of the night, with little sleep, moving, packing, and cleaning. We got a much more roomier apartment now, and it wasn't meant with ill-intent that she told us that, but it was just kind of a sour punch-in-the-gut at the moment.

We are moved, with only the final hiccup of phone/internet moving left to go. So while the actual day kind of sucked, the better apartment is sort of a nice Birthday gift. Harry Potter was awesome, we both loved it to death. I wore my Snape Friend or Foe shirt and Colt wore a self-made slytherin necklace. Colt also got me a lovely unicorn necklace that's gotten many comments at work. That about covers the gifts. :)



Still at same lame job though, upper-management's stiffing of night crew and complete inconsideration is making us all more and more tired of the job. Hopefully I'll find a second or better job soon, but eh, whatever works for now."

"event","Went back last night. Started bleeding badly all of a sudden again at work. Tea bags only stopped the bleeding for 5/10 minutes. Told my boss if I couldn't get it to stop in an hour or two I'd have to go to the ER. Well, I had gotten to the point I decided to tough out the shift since it was stopping and starting, and that was when it started really gushing and rapidly forming clots.

Needless to say I shortly booked my way up to the hospital. They packed it in, getting it to stop, and refilled my prescrip for Percocet. Taking tonight off, and consulting dentist as per my instructions when I go in for the original sutures to be removed on Monday. Everybody at the ER was a bit confused why it wasn't more healed by now. The dissolving stitches from the monday night ER visit must have done just that, dissolved, but 6 days after the tooth was removed, it should not bleed that badly.

Oh, and joy joy side note, no open appointments to finish getting teeth removed until July, so at this rate, I will have 5% chewing ability until like next Fall. D:


Plus side, I'm taking today off(first full day I've missed since starting work). That means a three-day weekend... three-day weekend of liquids and minimal soft foods.. but three-day weekend nonetheless. XD"

"event","So yesterday was the big start of the great extraction. My appointment was at 10:15am so I just stayed up after work for it. Went off just fine, removed the two top rear teeth on either side and asked me if I wanted to do the next two on both sides, or call it good for now. I figured I'd minimize the trips and go for it. Left at 11am with nothing but my front four teeth left on the top, being my adult canines had never grown out either after the babies were pulled 8 years ago. Wasn't that bad, bleeding was a little heavy but I expected to bleed heavier anyways.

We went to Wal-Mart to get something for Mother's Day since we couldn't really get around yesterday and we had no money before that. Got some tea bags to bite on because the tanic acid helps stop bleeding and they absorb more blood than gauze does, plus they gave me a piddly amount of gauze. We then progressed out to the area where I have to make my cash advance payment. It was around then I realized I wasn't supposed to change teabags more than once an hour, and only supposed to leave them in for 20 minutes at a time. So I started to cut back, plus I got tired of not being able to talk. We had began to worry I was bleeding a bit too much, but we dismissed it.

Our next stop was next to the theater, as we had planned to see Wolverine and Star Trek today. I proceeded to hoof it to Mom's to leave her gifty(she wasn't home it turned out). Heading back, I popped into a bathroom because I had felt something weird in my mouth. I removed a blood clot from the left side the size of my thumb.

We went through the movies okay, although another clot had started to form. I was still bleeding fairly bad too, considering it had by the time the movies were done, been 11 hours since the procedure. So we fanaggled a ride from Mom's boyfriend to the ER. I hadn't been feeling bad or anything, except maybe a little nauseous from all the blood I had swallowed, considering I had had nothing but water since 11pm the night before by now. Mostly, we wanted to see if they could do something about the clot and stop/slow the bleeding. Got to the heart rate monitor, and part way through it had to re-tighten. My heartrate was 56 / 40 (if I remember correct). I began to crash all of a sudden.

My whole body went a bit tingly and disconnected. I got so close to not being able to see that more of my vision was black and white than blurry sight. Managed to get myself into the wheelchair and they took me to a bed. Vision returned after about 10 minutes of fighting to not pass out. It didn't help I'd been awake for pretty much 30 hours by this point. Shortly later I puked up about a quarter gallon of blood. After that I was pretty much okay though. The cutey ER dude removed the clot in a few chunks, it had apparently grown partially down my throat, and the whole thing weighed over 3 ounces. He re-stitched the left side where it was bleeding, and after my blood work came back okay, I eventually went home.

So, now I'm back on schedule with eating jello, icecream, and soup. My appointment on Thursday. we were supposed to see if I was healed enough to remove stitches, and proceed to the bottom teeth for now before we finish the top. But after today, I will have them probably just stick to the stitches. Sucky part is, I believe they don't have another appointment spot until July. =/"

"event","So, lot has happened I guess since the last time I updated. Got passed up for getting all over-night shifts because it would be ""a waste of talent"" despite that I'd been TOLD for months I would get it when the other kid quit / got canned. Not only that, but then I got to TRAIN the dude for the shift -I- wanted. Then was going to try for the over-night management as it opened up a few weeks later, but my friend Kenny (whom I'd worked with back in the day 4 years ago) had talked to the boss first. Wasn't so upset about that, didn't really want the binding responsibility, it just seemed a new window for a consistent shift during the time I prefer. Ironically enough, a few weeks still after that, the new kid doing front over-night turned in his two-weeks, after I'd already had to pick up one of his shifts because two jobs were overloading him. So I went straight to the big-boss, who had happened to just take over doing schedules. He agreed that the ""waste of talent"" was bullshit and gladly gave me the shift I wanted. Couple weeks ago I also asked for a raise, should get that soon now that inventory is back to good numbers. So now I'm better set up to get a second job, or aim for a good solid one, plus I've been at this job nearly 6 months now, so my work history is looking a tad less flakey again too.

On the bill front, most of them are still stewing untouched, and at least two student loans have gone to collections. IE, bills have not improved yet overall, but, I might have a plan to tackle all the credit ones at least, if I'm lucky, and that will give me one much lower payment for all of them, and just leave the student loans. Will still prolly need another job, but part-time will be more feasible, just have to make it all happen, if my hopeful saving grace will go for it.

Home front, bit of an improvement there! We are now holed up in a sleeper room since last Thursday, in fact like 6 hours short of a full week. It's $300 a month all utilities paid except phone/internet, sharing a kitchen and bathroom with a few other units. Not too bad, and it's a place to actually call ours, plus the chance to feel more self-sufficient with a solid rent due on a regular basis. Gets us a bit more ready for when we come up for public housing or a section 8 voucher. My mother has also gotten into a new place, and it was where she was hoping to go through public housing. It's just a matter of getting the rest of her stuff out of the old house and into storage. It will kind of suck though, we've lived in that building for 11 years now, and before that one of my best friends' owned it since I met him in like '93. So I've been going in and out of that building for 16 years.

Mental front, I've been seeing the therapist at the clinic while I'm on the homeless program. It's been doing a lot to help, I'm slowly breaking down some of my self-destructive cycles, building some confidence, and being trapped in this body is bothering me a little less for the meantime. It's nice to have another outlet for talking about being transgendered that's in person. I try to talk to my mate as much as I can, which I know I could still do more, but she's not really sure what to do other than console and just be there for me and really there isn't much more, plus someone who's less personally involved can be nice now and then. But I am still trying to work on talking more, and I think the therapy and improved confidence will help me be more open elsewhere also. I've always been better at writing things out than actually talking, part of why I like journals on here, but I stopped doing that even. Hopefully I can improve in person both for me and for my mate, and resume using this outlet a bit more again.

Physical front, I took a couple therapy sessions for my knee, the knee cap was loose and I had a tracking problem from muscles trying to compensate. So they gave me some exercises and stretches to help both with that, and with general leg health and fitness. I haven't been doing that great on doing them, but I'm not giving up, and this last month has been really hectic. I hope now that we're in a place that might lend better to doing them, and as I form a routine now that my work schedule is consistent, that I will get better at doing them regularly. Also on the physical front, I'm getting all my upper teeth removed, and half the lower, and getting dentures. Teeth start getting pulled next week, dunno just how long the whole process is going to take.

Well, I think that's about it for now, about time to crash for the morning. =D"

"event","Well, went to the doctor to re-estalish at my old clinic two weeks ago. Visit turned out better than I had dreamed it ever could. I knew I would apply for their sliding fee scale again since I did before, well, once I have two paystubs anyways. But. Apparently, I count enough as homeless, being in an unstable temporary living situation at my mom's, that I get even better than cheap doctor visits.

For 6 months, I get free doctor visits, free dental visits, and free counselor visits at my clinic. PLUS, on top of that, they pay for all prescriptions I need, and if I call ahead of time before visiting the ER, they will refer me and cover ER visits too. I also intend to hit the dentist, I'm hoping dentures may be covered considering the bad condition of my mouth, and I also plan to utilize the counselor. If I'm really lucky, I may be able to get on hormones to help curve the moods. Colt's visit is on Thursday to get hooked up as well, which is stellar because this means we may FINALLY be able to start getting some of her many medical problems fixed and dealt with, as well as getting her on her medications that otherwise, we've just not been able to afford.

Next news.

Work is going pretty well, I've been doing the overnight shifts on Saturday and Sunday for a month now. Apparently I'm doing really good, and my manager on nights, Jason, has been putting in a lot of good word for me. It looks nearly guaranteed for me to get more / all overnight shifts because the other front room worker doesn't do shit-nothing at night. IF I do get more, the GM told me I'd also get a raise.

But!

I may not even need that, because I have a very nice potential job opportunity. Two weeks ago I applied for a job at a bank as a Computer Operator. It's a cross between data-entry and PC troubleshooting. They prefer, though not require, someone with a Computer Information Systems Associate and bank experience. Well, I'm short on the exp part, but I do have the Associates. This job is like full-time plus hours with a whole list of benefits, and unlike most of the other comp jobs I've shot for, not quite so out of my league / sniped by people with more experience. The position's been open for about 2 months, so I think they're also in a hurry to get it filled.

My interview is tomorrow, so please, any and all good luck would be much appreciated.


Plus it helps that I still have a status improvement if this doesn't pan out.



Downsides, still have not done about anything to touch the mountain of past-due / collection-agency-acquired bills. But that will come in time, hopefully if I get the good job, I'll work a month or two of weekend nights at BK and have an extra few hundred bucks a month to pour straight into repairing debt.

Other downside, been getting a lot of moods and stuff, or they've been surfacing more at least. Really, they're usually there anyways, it's just sometimes I ignore them, or there's enough there to shadow them. Mostly Trans-related. It's gotten to the point that it almost hurts to be referred to as Matt. I don't hate the name, but all it represents to me now is a shell and an internal hell of near-nonexistance that I want to be done with. I'm working on trying to get my closest friends here and my coworkers to call me Aurora, which has met some success and will just simply take time. It's really hard for me because I have two hells to choose from, the one inside that I've been fighting for my whole life, or the one outside from ""inconveniencing"" people and those who, understanding or not, would attack and hurt me for trying to be myself as I see me. I used to think it was easier to tear myself apart and be convenient and acceptable to everyone else. I went so far as learning to insult myself and make myself shut up before some other jackass could attack me, thought it was easier to be mad at just myself, than to be mad at a few or many other people. And that's created such a hell in my head I can't even begin to describe. But I'm working to undo that, and part of that is my name. For a few years, I've given Matt as my name because it's my legal name, it's convenient and easy for others to say. I've made a very conscious note of that fact numerous times, it simply is not MY name anymore, it just isn't. So, I'm using that as my first step against my inner hell. It's not as severe as, say, the self-insult defense I developed back during school, but it's a good start towards a smidget of self-esteem and my real self-identity. Yes, I do plan on changing my legal name.

Colt has been a real big support, and I don't talk to her as much as I should either. Which is another thing I'm trying to correct. Problem is most of my troubles are things that aren't really going to be eased much by talking, they are long term. But it does help a bit, and I'm trying to let her be there for me more. I have a habit of being able to just spew to a screen, or in text, a lot better than actively talk. Especially because my old ""defense"" rears and makes me think I'm just going to be coddled or slapped with a ""buck up"" if I do talk about how I feel. I spent a couple hours talking to my pony love this morning after work, it was very nice, and part of why I wanted to make this entry now that I've talked with her more, and more recently, about how I'm feeling. I hope to be able to talk more, and write more in-depth entries, over time, for two reasons. One, I want to feel closer to my wifey-mare, and I don't like feeling guilty about writing a journal entry on here. So, I figure a good way to improve my expression is to try and more actively talk to her, and then write a post-entry. I may manage to squeeze even more out in the entry, and either way, we get closer and I improve my communication.

My love isn't able to do much right now to help around the house or with finances, and that does stress me a little bit sometimes. But she is such a moral support for me, and particularly my gender identity, that I wouldn't trade her for nothing. I wish it didn't stress me at all, because most of why she can't help much is the FIVE BAJILLION medical problems, and I feel bad even wanting more help from her. So I try not to let it get to me, even though it still does sometimes. But then I get to curl up with her, and even if I can't communicate very well, my life's shell identity disappears, and I'm truly -MYSELF- because not only do I exist and mean something to someone else, I do so in person, in entirety, as me, in gender, name, soul, and any other manner that matters. That's also part of the reason why I miss the internet so much too, because I get a small snippet of that here also, because while I have a few close friends who I love to death in real life, there's just a weird barrier of identity and self that I feel between us. I know that they like me for who I am inside, but there's just too much of the shell of me outside that's mixed in that it makes things awkward for me. But I ramble now, the point is, I have someone I love very much that gives me a set of arms within which I can forget all my confusion, loosen all my barriers, and just feel like I'm me and that I really do actually exist, and that I really should exist.

For now, I should get back home. I was going to pop online at the library, but it's one of those silly Monday holidays, so I'm using the weak webs at the laundromat. I've checked what I needed to check for my love, and I've made a nice sizable journal entry apparently, lol. I was only going to write a paragraph or two. *snicker*"

Job opportunities already look much brighter, and there's some options creeping about for apartments too. Internet will be a while, despite how much we're going through withdrawals already, lol. But there's hopes, and that's always a good place to start. It's also great to be able to get together again with old friends. Anyways, gonna cut this short for now, but there will be more later.

And thanks again to everyone for wishes and help getting us here. *hugs to all*"

"event","Yes, the obligatory Dead-Bird-Day Post. I hope everyone will have a great day, holiday-celebrating or not, and good food on your table regardless. We're lucky to even have a good meal today, thanks to our neighbors, we're very thankful to have had them as our neighbors now and since we got here.

Our trip is about set, we've got our luggage, though the bags we got were a tad smaller than I'd hoped, they'll do. We should be able to take most of what's left with us with the luggage we have. We also have some money for food for the trip, and should be fine now, thanks to a few very kind friends on the web.

We leave just after midnight Tuesday night, and arrive in the evening on Thursday. Dunno when we'll have internet connection again after we leave, hopefully pretty quick, but my mom's is close to the library so we have limited use there if nothing else in the meantime. Just need to finish getting in touch with my boss to see how much she can help on the job front, and I'm going to look into options through my old school there too, shouldn't be too hard even with the economy at the moment.

Biggest downside left at the moment, our cat Twilight. Who also, we noticed a few days ago, appears to be pregnant. I guess Orion actually got her and it stuck just before we gave him up almost a month ago. That's great, but it also sucks, because Colt won't be able to keep one of the kittens. Colt's mom is going to keep Twilight until the kittens are healthy to be seperated and then she'll find homes for them all. I'm going to miss her, but in exchange, I at least get to be with Taz again before anything happens to her. Wish Flash was still around, 8 months too late to see him again. *sigh* Almost more than keeping Twilight, I wish we could at least keep a kitten for Colt, she's had to give up her cats a couple times because of moving.

Anyways, everyone have a good day, even if it's just another day! *hugs and love*"

"event","Well, we've decided on our next move. The situation here is too volatile, with the job market like it is in this place, and how far behind everything is, there's too much risk in staying. Unless one of us could be working and getting a -full- paycheck by the end of next week, we can't recover enough to make things work and keep from being potentially homeless. This has never been working well here from the beginning anyways, we jumped into a situation that was already unstable unbeknownst to us. So, we're cutting losses and heading to my hometown where we know I can get a guaranteed job immediately and we have a definate roof over our heads without heavy financial burden until we're on our own again.

Our last checks will about cover the bus fare, maybe just a little short. But that still leaves food for the 2 day trip, plus we could use an extra luggage bag each so we can at least keep most of our clothes and stuff. If anyone can help out at all, even a couple bucks, please. It would be so greatly appreciated, and we will do our best to return any favors as soon as possible. I hate asking for money, but what's the worst that can happen, nobody has any to spare, so it doesn't hurt to out the plea for a little extra help.

"event","Guess I should update this again. Things were getting better, in a very roller coaster fashion, but managing towards better. Until this week. Well I guess the week before, considering Colt and I have been sleeping on the floor for 2 weeks now, but mostly this week.

Tuesday I fractured a rib falling on some stairs, nothing major, just a contusion. But still, not cool. Anyways, went to the hospital Thursday night after deciding it annoyed me enough to merit making sure it wasn't too serious. Got xrays and industrial strength painkillers, chalked off as a contusion, and went on my way.

Friday just started off funny to begin with. Long story short, Colt and I both got fired from work. She had set a sweatshirt aside on Tuesday to pay for it on Wednesday. Well, on Wednesday she paid for a few things, including that so far as she can remember, but she rang herself up and forgot to keep the receipt. So after I took the shirt home after work on Thursday, it looked like we had stolen it. Because of some other factors going on at work, the fact we can't prove otherwise, and my position as a manager in training, boss was forced to let us both go because of too much liability.

We've got some plans, but it's all up in the air on what'll happen and how we'll pull through this one. This is saying nothing for the 7 bills heading to collections already. *sigh*"

Alright, so Tuesday I went on a walk to find more places to apply to, since Burger King(having been the last place I'd worked for) did not seem interested, and computery-jobs all require work experience I don't have and can't get. Found a little grocery store a little ways away, applied(terribly short app), and had an interview right ther. Well, Wednesday was my birthday, was a bit depressed during it, not so much because of not doing something special or getting presents, but mostly the finances and all my credit lines going to hell in a bank basket, and missing people and past independence more lately. Well, today I got a call at 11am asking if I still wanted a job, and I started working soon as I got there today.

It's not much, honestly I don't even know how much I'll make per hour, and it'll only be part-time with seeming little chance of full. But it's something, and I can start paying things places to stop calling me now, heh.

Also I'm slowly working on revamping my website from the ground up, and I intend to start doing some small programming projects. I might just try and make some simple games and throw them out for the sharks to get into things a bit before I get to Digipen, so by the time I finish there, I already have a strong foothold. But that's all future goals, main thing right now is to repair finances and try and regain some sense of independence and stability."

Just not safely feasible to move over there, let alone make tuition without digging a potentially nasty financial hole. So I've talked to the school, my registration is bumped ahead a year and in the meantime, we make our way to Pittsburgh.

We're going to stay with Colt's mother, help her through her medical problems, while we save up and lower debts for a year. Honestly, part of me is really down about not going on right now, but I was actually the one to suggest it. There's just too many reasons this plan is so much better that it would be pretty foolish to go with the old plan now.

On the other hand, I will be like 20 minutes from AC. In a situation where money isn't much of a problem if we don't have jobs immediately, which we should. Plus no need for a hotel. This means I will at least make it back to AC this year! I will gets to see a lot of people I haven't seen for a long time, and omg, guilders, we need to get together!

      So, you want to make the world a better place? Too bad it's never gonna happen. </p><p>

Of all the types, you have to be one of the hardest to find fault in. You have a selfless and caring nature. You're a good listener and someone who wants to avoid conflict. You genuinely desire to do good. </p><p>

Of course, these all add up to an incredibly overpowered conscience which makes you feel guilty and responsible when anything goes wrong. Of course, it MUST be your fault EVERYTIME. </p><p>

Though you're constantly on a mission to find the truth, you have no use for hard facts and logic, which is a source of great confusion for those of us with brains. Despite this, in a losing argument, you're not above spouting off inaccurate fact after fact in an effort to protect your precious values. </p><p>

You're most probably a perfectionist, which in this case, is a bad thing. Any group work is destined to fail because of your incredibly high standards.</p><p>

Disregard what I said before. You're just easy to find fault in as everyone else! </p><p>

Luckily, you're generally very hard on yourself, meaning I don't need to waste my precious time insulting you. Instead, just find all your own faults and insult yourself.

"event","Well, finished as much as I can at the old apartment today. Problem is, the office apparently isn't open until 7pm anymore, so I couldn't turn in my keys. Which means I have to fucking go back again tomorrow and waste another fucking bus pass. Plus I don't know if they'll charge me some bullshit amount for not paying the bullshit amount I was supposed to pay by the end of the month. Because I don't know if that counts on the 1st like rent, or if it had to be today, anyways, it's rent for the next 15 days even though my moving out date was today, because I only gave 45 days notice blah blah blah. Well at least I should be done with that tomorrow after I fork over my last $220 on credit cards to them, I won't have that stress anymore, unless they tack on more or something.

So one less thing on the stress list of doom, so now in the next three weeks I only have to do the following..
Find a job
File taxes
File FAFSA
Apply to Digipen once I have money to do so
Clean and unpack room here
Read the driver's manual for Indiana enough to get my learners permit
tons of laundry still
And of course, constantly, my five effing classes.

But that's okay, I can take in stress like candy. Now I'm going to go off and fill out my application for Burger King where I'll most likely get the job open at the moment and soon add full time assistant management stress to the list. At least that'll bite off credit card and a bit of re-moving stress in the long run, if I live that long. I would go for something else, but there's no time to be picky, and I should be guaranteed to get it.

Oh rights, lulz abound, our fun almost-romping time the other night nearly caught the house on fire. Apparently despite pointedly clearing everything away from candles to make sure it was safe, a pillow got repositioned and after only touching one for a half second, a quarter of it was on fire like it was made of gasoline or some shit. Well that kind of fucked the night over and woke up the household. We're gonna keep the fire a little more emotional next try. So much for the romantic moment though. :S"

So, FC just got over and Colt got back this afternoon. It's nice to have her back, although my independent side was also enjoying the solitude(spent a lot of time at the old apartment), I did really miss her and heaven's knows she missed me. Got a bit confused for a while she was gone, but just came to realize that enjoying my independent solitary side doesn't mean I don't miss her.

Had my SAT tests on Saturday. Thought I was doing well, didn't finish a couple questions at the end of a few sections though, and by the last sections, my sleep deprivation combined with that gave me a mini-meltdown. *coughs* All's good now, though it didn't help that I lost one of Colt's Skellinton gloves, getting on the bus during said meltdown.

Still finishing at the old apartment, heading back up tomorrow, it's pretty much cleaning left now. I will be so happy when that's done, one less thing driving me bat-brains with stress.

Hrm, I can't remember what else I wanted to post, so I thinks I go to bed.. or something towards that direction. *cough*


Oh right, I tried to get my hair white back in December, but at blonde it raped my hair too bad. So I finally dyed it back to black the other day. Hair's slowly recovering, but I don't wanna risk trying for white even if it got healthy enough to continue. And I missed black so much, although Colt thought the blond was really hot."

"event","So, I haven't updated for ages. I've tried, started a few entries, but each time I got distracted / called away for whatever reason, or decided I didn't have anything worth writing. Or it was emo, lulz.

Spent first half of December on school, and hoping I hadn't completely fudged up one class that would throw me off an entire semester. Thankfully I didn't, which means at the end of next semester, unforeseen aside, I should have my associates. Plan after that is more school actually, trying for Digipen in Redmond, Washington, right next to Seattle. Colt misses the ocean, and between here and the west coast(particularly Oregon or Washington), I almost wanted to move there more, but I had everything set up here, and I wanted to be sure I was not just mimicking my brother(who moved there when he first left the nest). But that's not the moving I'm referring to this post, actually, so let's step back to the beginning of December.

So I got another student loan in December, which allowed me to finally quit PennStation for good on December 2nd. Praise be I am finally free. The loan was quite big, granted I will have to pay it off later, but it has helped so much now. I got out of the hole entirely for a while, every credit card payed off, check advance payed off, some needed (and some wanted things) for my wife and I, and the rent and utilities for 2 months of living with our new roomies.

That brings to the next big change, moving. I am moving about 20 mins south of Indy to Greenwood, where we'll live with some friends of Colt's(and well, my friends now too). The costs will be about the same as here, but with a better neighborhood, fresh start, more opportunity for socializing for Colt(she's been desperately needing that), and other benefits including increased options for me learning to drive. So overall it's a better move, slightly less convenient for my one class in person, but that should manage okay enough.

Downside, while we had enough aside for costs for the new apartment, spending went over elsewhere and I've had to dip back into my credit cards a fair bit for the old apartment, having to pay all of January's rent plus pro-rated rent for the 15 days short notice on moving(supposed to give 60, only gave 45). Which kinda sucks, cause that comes to $650 more. But, I'm still better off on cards than I used to be, half as many payments to make, not right on the edge of my limits, and enough cash to hold over until I get my next financial aid disbursement. Not to mention caught up with all other bills too, as I was 1-3 months behind on phone, power, and internet before. With all luck, I should still hopefully not have to work this semester and just focus on school. Colt's gonna get a job down there once she gets back from Further Confusion in January.

The holidays were mostly spent at the new apartment starting from the 24th(Colt, with mostly the new roomies at first, then Reynard showed up, and then other guests until the official Christmas + New Years part on the 31st. It went well overall and was a good time, though a bit more socializing than I'm used to or particular too. Most of that time though we didn't have our room there yet though, so there was no escape for me for the first half of it. By the end that was changed, and I could slip off for an hour or two and play a game, then rejoin the others no problem. I'm just very limited and moody with socializing, my friends back home can attest to that, but it'll be okay.

So, now I'm back home on my newly rebuilt computer and it's massive screen, taking breaks between bouts of cleaning and packing. I also have my SAT on the 26th, but I won't get to study much for that, if I even do, until this is done. I never took one during High School, and I wouldn't now, but it's part of the reqs for Digipen.

Anyways, should get back to work, and now you all know, yes, I am still alive...or I'm a zombie'corn that's good enough at typing, one of the two."

"event","Well, my mom got out of the hospital from the tumor removal on Wednesday. She's staying at my brother's house a few days so she doesn't have to deal with the stairs at home. Overall, she's doing okay, sore and tired, but not in real pain. She's also getting to be lazy and relax, which is about time, with all she puts up with at work.

She's healing up well from the surgery, which went well. Now it's getting psyched up to tackle chemo. Her first therapy is around Thanksgiving. My brother said ""on"" I'm pretty sure, but he may have meant that general time or within a few days, mom didn't catch when I asked and I didn't push it.

She finally got to meet Shana and see me again through webcam Wed and Thurs night, plus her ""boyfriend"" got to meet me Thursday night, and I him. They're in a relationship, but it's hard to say exactly where it stands, and until some things change my mom is keeping it at pretty much friends, though I'm not sure he's actually grasped that yet. Right, anyways.

Kinda sucky, she had the surger ON Halloween, and if the chemo starts on Thanksgiving.. just, wtf.

I'm doing better about it all than I was a week ago, but I wish I could visit somehow. I can't even afford to send the package we put together. *sighs* I still can't believe it, my mom has cancer.. -_-"

"event","I've gotten tired of having nothing to do but whine here, and haven't had much else to post than that since my last post, so I've just not bothered posting. Financial aid came and went, got to spend a fun day out on the town but also got slapped by more financial screw ups in the process, even while trying to fix some.

Day before, on monday the 22nd, I found out my mother has colon cancer, her surgery was on Halloween. They are confident they caught it early, and the tumor was removed smoothly and without problem.

But..

They also found spots of cancer on her liver, looks to be the same cancer, but it means she has to start chemotherapy once she heals from the surgery. I can't even afford to go see her before February at this rate, especially with this new onslaught of fees and screw ups. Between that, school, and usual work crap, I can't convey how hard it is to keep any focus or sanity right now.

Plus to ice the cake, I have to ace everything the rest of the semester in one class to get a C, though that's mostly my own fault. I need another computer here, one just isn't enough to accomodate Colt and me.


More positive, went to a Halloween part last Saturday with some local furs. Most of them were pretty cool, and the one who hosted the party wants us to come over again this weekend. Nice to have a social venue for once.

And I do have a wonderful mate here to help me right now, I love you hon and thank you. She puts up with a lot at work to try and keep going and she's given up so much to live her, I know this lifestyle is really hard on her.

Cats are demons, it is proven. XD

"event","Wasted time.. gods I put myself through hell to make it to the 1st interview(everything seemed to work against me, printers especially).. then again for the second, including nearly losing my wallet..to use a printer.. The fuck is up with me and printers? So anyways, my second interview was a day-long observation job-shadowing today. I would almost do it, I feel I could probably sell well enough to not be at too much risk because of it being commission-based, but.. it would require leaving home at 5:30am to return about 9pm. And I'm sorry 15+ hours away from home in one day, wash+rinse+repeat 5 times a week, only 9 of which actually selling and if sales aren't good neither is my money... not quite worth it, despite the fast-track manager-training (the real point to the system).

So I dunno, I have Wed-Fri off(in case I had gotten it, could start ""right away"") might refurbish my resume during that, might not. I don't know if I can find anything that will quite fit what I want / need. Some things (like this) might be fun enough, but if they don't open enough potential opportunities for my personal goals, or I kill myself to make them work, then it's not worth more than just staying where I am.

But I'm damn sure I would have been in if I had chosen to(which I couldn't quite choose either way all day, the final straw was start-time, which I corrected my folly of assumption about on the way back to office). So needless to say, the choice was damned hard, being I might have made it work until I have personal transportation, I dunno, and it all got me rather depressed for a while. I also missed class, but that one is a total literal repeat of one I took back home, save maybe not quite as well taught(and that's not easy, feh). I only have to take it because of how credits transferred.

I just feel so stuck sometimes. And it feels like anything I might try to do to change that, requires some other component already in place.. like a car to get a new job, but I need a new job to get a car. Plus without at least my associates, most options seem to be ""get stuck in a new dead end, same thing, less familiarity"""

"event","Well, the entry is a day late, but yesterday was my wife's foalday. It was also our 1-month anniversary(..I'm the ""it's our...anniversary"" whore of the relationship, heh). We had to work all day, but work wasn't too bad, and we hung out afterwards with the asst manager a bit. Drank a bit last night, though it hit her stomach hard at first because we hadn't really had much to eat yet that day. And I had a problem with cramping leg last night that kind of screwed other plans. So the day was ""eh,"" sadly, but we get payed tomorrow, so there shall be a ""make-up"" birthday after money is in hand to do so, hehehe...

Other-news, dropping one of my online classes because trying to catch up in it(got my books for three classes, 2 weeks late) isn't happening and is conflicting with other courses a bit, and detering me from wanting to study in general. I'll just retake it next semester, my fin-aid isn't reduced, but I am too late for a tuition-reimbursement, so I lose some money, but at this time, I wouldn't really -learn- anything in the class so it's better off this way.

Work is the same as usual, Colt and I are both wanting to get our asses out of there, she's seeing a lot more now about my boss and the environment. It's just so randomly negative and egg-shell-walking, she's okay if she's in a good mood, but her critique methods are too abbrasive and demeaning and when she gets pissed off, for good or silly reasons, it's miserable for everyone. It's hard to explain fully, but that sums it up okay. I'm hoping with this check there should be enough extra for Colt to get the license she needs for security work here, which she wants to get back into until she can resume EMT school.

WHO'S GOING TO FC?

We're gonna be there this year, no choice. Colt's the art track lead, so we kinda hafta be there, heh. So it's gonna happen this time!

For those who missed it before, my mate moved in with me early June, our birthdays are on the 16ths of July and September, so August 16th was the perfect day to tie the knot.

We did it at the courthouse, it was short, we got there about 11 and left by 11:30. Good thing too because none of us got more than a couple hours sleep the night before. We also weren't allowed to bring cameras in, poo, but we got a few pictures and the judge took an after-marriage polaroid.

We then went to Benihanas for our wedding meal, it was awesome, even if expensive. Her mom paid, she seems really nice, and we get along pretty well. After that we went to her mom and sister's hotel to swim and nap a bit before we headed home.

I'll not go into the day after, it was.. well, not the typical honeymoon, even for a non-honeymoon. Her mom had car troubles and her sister went to the hospital because she's a dumbass about eating, while pregnant..  but sis is back out and doing better, as she can be with her habits, and we're going to attempt to go to the fair again today."

I'm still alive, yes I am! In fact tomorrow is the anniversary of that fact.

Right, so anyways, just trying to regain some balance inside, between money issues and physical weariness it's all just thrown me into a (more) neurotic limbo. Everything is prodding me more personally than it should, ""i love my uni"" ..heh, my mate, better than the random letters she kept posting earlier, hehe.

Anyways, everything's poking my lack of single skill or ability to excel at, or telling me I've not experienced anything, or don't know anything. I'm rather good or okay at a lot of things, but that's being too easily ignored and single mistakes and goofs are drowning that for me because it seems like there's always people around me who are better at everything and I've gotten lost in comparing again. I really hate this limbo being stuck between identities, it's taxing, all the time. It's more aggravating of late because I'm not recharging enough, my -good- shields seem to be down almost entirely and I can only seem to rest, physically, mentally, or emotionally, up to a basic or sub-par level at best. Quite frankly, even if maybe adding a little to it now and then unintentionally, my mate being here is the only thing keeping me from bleeding to death inside. S'what it feels like anyways.

I do think I'm starting to sift up out of it slowly, but ugh. I have some days off for my b-day though, it should help.


Unrelated, there's some chance I might be able to get my one year vacation pay even though I'd quite(twiceish), depends on what date is listed in the payroll, boss is checking it out and I'll get it on my check Tuesday if I can. *crosses hooves*

Also managed to procure a couch and chair Thursday night, dragged from the other side of Westlake(that was tiring x.x) but YAY.

Even better.. an actual bed last night, good timing too, since the air matress got killzored Wednesday. FINALLY.

Finances are sucking more and more and I really don't know how I'm going to get out of this, it seems real hopeless and I hate dragging my love into it. I feel really rotten right now, she shouldn't have to deal with this too, and her mom (bless her heart) is gonna help a bit, but I just feel awful about my position, all these near misses have brought me from a possible okay point back to suck, by (now estimated) $350+ in retarded fines all within a few weeks. And I really wanted some spare money, even a little, to make our day in August as special as possible, now it's like I can't do anything for it and I feel like a damned leech.. I really hate that feeling, really really..

Anyways, no webs as mentioned, except the few times I can sneak into this network, but I don't want to do that any more than necessary.

I don't want to know how much more I'm going to have to puke up for rent now that the check bounced. *curls up in a ball*

As said before, you all have a Happy 4th of July, I'm trying to not get too down, do me a favor and have an extra great day for the both of us, eh? *hugs and kisses to all, plus some snuggles and bites for a certain nightmare*"

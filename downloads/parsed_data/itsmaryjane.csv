"event","I forgot I had this. basically my father absolutely does NOT appreciate my destructive and poor decision making. he thinks his life is too complicated, so he would rather sit at home and be an ignorant asshole than to grow the fuck up and talk to me. soooooooo i live in new york now

im not totally sure how i feel about that
i miss my life"

"event","life is a blur, days on a balance beam, balancing many things

My mind is a jungle gym and i wish i had a file folder i could organize my thoughts into because right now they are off the fucking wall. all the guilt, i dont get it. i am so satisfied but so dissatisfied. whiskey, cigarettes, espresso coffee and zero sleep. midnight adventures, adventuring always, slacking on homework but making it up atthelastminute and somehow doing okay

trying to keep negativity out of my life, seeing negativity all AROUND ME

shits exciting, sometimes.. but i do wish i could settle down sometimes and relax sometimes, I cant. really I wish i had a fucking file folder or something because seriously My thoughts are off the fucking walls right now

and then the fucking flashback. its weird to see pieces of my past and not be able to

"event","i never wanted an lj because stupid ass drama queens write out all their bullshit for you to read and im not so into that but here i am and i do have some shit to say

i am sick of being this girl that lies
and cheats
and steals
all the fucking time
i feel like i'm the sneakiest most dishonest person i know
and its not even on purpose
and im always stoned
and in the like 4 hours im not blazed or asleep, im drunk
i just feel like im wasting every day on poison and fake friends
so im sick of that because

if you cant respect yourself no one else can respect you right?

and thats what i want, is for people to chill with me ebcause they want to chill with ME, the real me, and i dont really know who that is
but the more i try to findout who i am, i just feel like a phony and i hate that so i dont think about it and subconviously walk around like a big fucking fake because i am tooo much of a pussy to do anything about it, i guess.


bottom line, im chilling out with everything for a little bit
for myself
im training to be a jedi master and i cant give in to the dark side




and if you arent cool with that, fuck you"

"event","summer man
it's been all about sneaking out and stealing the car
going to charles studio
driving through a forest to find a spot
drinking at 2pm in the woods
fucking 100 degrees outside
getting caught
getting hungover
going shopping
swimming in the hotel pool
unlocking the locked closet
kelsey's backporch...
drinking on the neighbor's trampoline
fighting
fighting
fighting
raceing
falling
smoking on the roof
dillo
and boy trouble


but it's been really, really fucking sweet"

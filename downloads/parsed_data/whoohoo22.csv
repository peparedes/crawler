"event","yay!!! i found my long lost mariah carey christmas CD. It's definitely my favorite CD during the month of December. It totally gets me in the Christmas spirit. ok, the mocking may begin right.....now. haha  (PS - sorry laura, you'll probably get sick of it and want to shoot me...lol or just chop my arm off like the man guy almost did.)

Ab and Jo, my apologies for being a pooper and not coming over to see everyone last night. It will be all the more exciting when we see each other at christmas. and Jo i heard your hair is really cute! 

Although this trip home had its boring moments...ok hours. It was all in all a good time. Obviously being with family and old friends was wonderful. Thanksgiving was super filling, got almost all of my christmas shopping done, and relaxed and slept more than i thought i ever would. 

There was a huge garage fire at my neighbors yesterday. We saw smoke coming from their direction, and then within a matter of minutes the entire 2-car garage was up in flames. It was really scary...but as bad as it sounds, kind of cool to watch. I feel bad for the old couple that live there. Growing up we called them ""grandma and grandpa"" because they were like the happy, nice old couple...stereotypical grandparents. 

Still deciding whether or not to go out tonight. either hang out with friends that i hardly get to see anymore, or pack and read the book i was supposed to read.
hhmmm........."

"event","mmmm...halloween at augustana is awesome. i like it a lot.  definitely an excuse to dress slutty. I can't wait to get those pictures developed. i finally dont have a ton of homework this weekend. I mean i'm sure there are things i could be doing, but i'm taking it easy this weekend. man, i'd party again tonight if I had the energy. I think this time i would be a cowgirl. Saw a few cowgirls and hot cowboys last night, along with some angels, devels, a cupid, french maid, some arobic instructors, an elephant, police officers, mario and luigi. ya know what i just realized, guys dont use the uniform often enough. It's a well known fact that we girls are crazy about men in uniform. But still, you dont see all that many on halloween. Thats a shame. oh well!  time to go work out...not for the good of myself, but for the good of all the men across this great nation. lol

"event","There has been a live journal lull. It's my turn to fix that.
Although it has been a while since any of you boys had a baseball talk...i'd like to put my two cents in, sort of:

It's an enjoyable lifetime sport. A competitive, yet extremely friendly game. It's a great workout and an all-around good time. The problem? All those cocks. In choosing a bird, one must seriously consider the pros and cons of the cock. There are two general types of birdies: the nylon and the feather. Nylon, otherwise known as plastic birds, are nice for practice and even used in lower level competitions. Initially, and for a while, the nylon cocks will suffice; however, after continued use, they become more boring, almost too predicatble. Here's where the feathered cock comes in. A more mature player usually chooses feather over plastic. The feather birds, though more costly, are of a much higher quality. They fly further and at a greater speed. These birdies also require more care than nylon birds. They must first be humidified and kept at a specific temperature. The correct handling of the cock can result in intense and very plearsurable play. But remember, using a feather bird also involves taking a chance. In choosing a feather bird, you are risking bent and/or broken feathers, which are near impossible to fix. To conclude, be cautious in selecting a bird. A durable, feather bird is more favorable than a measly plastic cock."

"event","i hate this.  i knew something was wrong. i dont feel right. something is missing. i'm completely fine during the day, but it hits me at night. and tonight it hit my like a ton of bricks. i thought it was loneliness, which doesnt even make sense because i'm constantly surrounded by people. i guess i'm finally homesick. but i dont know why i am right now. i cant sleep when its this hot and that doesnt help at all. my friends mom saw and talked to my dad yesterday. she said he sounded sad, sad because he missed me. thats when i broke down and realized how much i really do miss my parents. and how much i take them for granted when they're around. how horrible my life would be if they weren't there right now or if i didnt have them growing up, haha no matter how annoying my mom is. god, i hate this feeling more than anything right now. there's no one to talk to. please, please make it go away."

"event","i was dressed for the evening. then i fell asleep at 10 and slept for 2 hours. oh well!  it was a good nap. i had wanted to take a nap. 
laura is sleeping now. i'm so relieved to have a cool roommate. 
people are in the lounge (including a cop? weird) so i cant play piano
we just watched final destination...freaky movie.
i've watched: office space, pirates of the carribbean, oceans 11, troy, finding nemo, lilo and stitch, and final destination. man i'm on a role. quite the accomplishment for someone as movie-ly challenged as myself.
i love the fishes cause they're so delicious. gonna go fishing.
everyone went home this weekend so it's kinda sucky.
""they brought me down to see her and they asked me if i would...do a little number, and i sang with all my might. she said tell me are you a christian and i said, ma'am i am tonight. walking in memphis...""
i want to go to church tomorrow. it would help if i could figure out when the service is. i dont think i've ever even seen the church/chapel/whatever.
maybe the lounge cleared out. i dont feel like walking all the way back down.
i want to watch the ring. but i'm not watching it alone. there's going to be a boy with me on that futon. mmmm....love the futon.
more badminton tomorrow! yay yay yay
i'm excited to go back for homecoming. i want to see ppl, family, friends, teachers, kitties. :)  i'm also excited for ppl to come here to visit, and for me to visit them at their schools. good times ahead
classes aren't too hard yet. english is literally mind-blowing. my brain freakin hurts after that class. haha but it's very interesting. lots of homework in chem and spanish too, but easy content so far. but i know that'll change soon, i'm just enjoying it while it lasts.
well i guess i'll go to bed. goodnight

We did some shopping at Galyan's where i purchased my cool new back pack.  It was weird, I ran into all these people i know. Stephanie was working there, I went up to ask her where something was and didnt even realize it was her at first...Arica, Dan, Jim, and Nate - Arica is so awesome, i miss that girl...tall Amanda from badminton works there too...Heidi Golz, she's going to Valpo, but got sick and had to come home already.

Lately my mom has been pretty emotional about me leaving her. my dad doesn't really talk about it much, i mean we talk about school, but he's never said anything about me leaving the house until today. we went out to lunch today. he told me how it's going to be so different and how he's going to miss me. then he told me that i've lived with them for 18 years, 8 months, and (looks at his watch) 5 days. i love my dad."

Sam's quote of the week ""Fine. I'll check my e-mail, but I'm not opening any attachments"" -hilarious! guess you had to be there. Sam is going to Wash U, you guys should meet him. He's one of the funniest kids i've ever met.

Sebastian called me yesterday. We ended up taking a ride on his motorcycle. We went down 83 all the way out to Willowbrook, around some windy roads in the woods. It was awesome!!! I was definitely scared at first, but once we got going it was so much fun. I was never one for motorcycles before, but damn that was hot."

That place is such a huge part of my life...or my childhood at least. I have so many memories there:  learning to waterski, flipping over in the sailboat, dominating in basketball, TP-ing Phil's house, Mr.Summer's pretending to jump off the boat and then actually falling in, catching HUGE fish (or so I thought), watching the stars on the pier after the campfire, snowball fights, sharing a first kiss, locking that annoying kid in the freezer, being locked in the freezer, running through the woods near Dead Man's Pond, sneeking around the old, abandon cabins next door at night, seeing the mystery light...and so on.  I can't wait to get there.

My mommy is sick today. It might have been that pie I brought her last night. So i'll have to go home and take care of her tonight.

I've heard that The Village wasn't so great - predicatble and not scary. That's disappointing.  

Haha Evan just came in turned my lights on, and walked out.

Kirby's going away party. success. thanks to the marriot residence inn, nick pulikowski, and a bunch of cool people...we had an awesome time.

Excuse the interuption: Teddy from Sunrise just IMed me. Haven't talked to him in months. He was up in wisconsin last week. I haven't seen that kid in four freaking years. He was visiting his grandparents and they all went to dinner at Sunrise one night. Phil ( the owner ) told him I was coming in yesterday, so Teddy came to surprise me, but obviously couldnt find me because I wasn't there. Oh well. I'll probably never see him again, but it would have been cool to see how he's turned out.

Back to the hotel party...probably the funniest thing that happened was when Nick and Dan - or should I say Harold and Kumar? haha - walked all the way to White Castle. It took them a good four hours, those crazy kids. I was definitely passed out by the time they came back. Where did my nerd rope go?

Big thanks to John and C for babysitting. I owe ya one.

Big A. I left a voicemail on your phone. But i just remembered that that's your mom's phone. Really hope you listen to and delete that message before anyone else does. 

Jo - where did you get that little blue hair drier?? I've been looking all over for it, but can't find it. :(  maybe they dont make them anymore. It's Conair right?

When I get home I'm going to call this girl I haven't talked to in 8 years. Then I'm going to call my roommate. i gotta call my buddy Sam who I've known since diapers. I think tonight is going to be a movie night. Whether we go out and see one or squish into my little TV room, i'm feeling like a movie. 

Tomorrow is Jimmy!!!!  Hopefully he'll see us. As long as we have our secret weapon- the ""Backstage?"" sign- works like a charm. hehe.  We'll have to tell him about our paper angels. He'll be so happy.  :-D

Well I'll never forget the first time that I heard
That pretty mouth say that dirty word
And I can't even remember now what she backed my truck into
But she covered her mouth and her face got red 
And she just looked so darn cute
That I couldn't even act like I was mad
Yeah I live for little moments like that

Well that's just like last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector in the house was goin' off
And she was just about to cry until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see me laugh
Yeah I live for little moments like that

I know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me
And I thank god that she isn't 'cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections it's the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions and we're lost but holdin' hands
Yeah I live for little moments like that

When she's layin' on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep so does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it 'cause it's tinglin' and it's numb
But she looks so much like and angel that I don't wanna wake her up
Yeah I live for little moments 
When she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it
Yeah I live for little moments like that


""That's Love""

There ain't a woman in the world
That wants to hear the word ""yes""
When she asks if you think
That she looks chubby in that dress
And if she cooks all day
You better eat it with a smile
It doesn't matter if it tastes just like
Bad gravy on a Goodyear tire.

Yeah, yeah, yeah all right
So you bend the truth
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's somethin'
That you'll have to get use to.

That's love you'll see
We all commit a little bit of perjury
Ah, but that's no crime if you ask me, that's love
You're starin' at a burnt steak
You bite the bullet and you clean your plate
And then you go on and on about how great it was
That's not a lie, that's love.

Well, it's the very same thing
That she does for you
When she doesn't bring up
The fifteen pounds you need to lose
And every time she runs
Her fingers through your hair
And she says she kinda likes
The way there's not as much of it there.

Yeah, yeah, yeah well all right
So she bends the truth
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's somethin'
That you have to get use to,

That's love you'll see
We all commit a little bit of perjury
Ah, but that's no crime if you ask me, that's love
You're bummin out, she says 
There's somethin kinda sexy about a bald head, 
And honey it'll make ya look twice as tough, 
That's not a lie, thats love.

Yeah, yeah, yeah well all right
So you bend the truth
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's somethin'
That you're both gonna do

'Cause that's love you'll see
We all commit a little bit of perjury
You say I like it when your momma comes to visit us
That's not a lie, that's not a lie, that's love..."

Besides who wouldnt be cheered up by boys dancing to ""Tearin Up My Heart."" ;) The nights festivites were greatly enjoyed. I'd say chapter 2 definitely beats chapter one, would you guys agree?
On Saturday I was prepared for tears, blood, and gnashing of teeth. Instead I got a ""So what'd you do last night?"" from Ebie (<--- haha, look guys! i'm learning). I was quite surprise and releaved! Today my dad was jsut making fun of me for it, but told me not to worry about it and that he did a lot of stuff he never told his parents about. Love those talks.
Ab and Jo's grad party was a good time too. Volleyball and dodgeball were awesome! 
Today I finally finished Caroline's scrapbook. That bad boy has 60 pages of pure memories. It's kind of amazing if I dont say so myself. 
Tonight will be muy relaxing."

"event","Its interesting what a long vacation with only the elderly around will do to you. Besides making you crazy and realizing that life is short and must be lived to the fullest, this vacation isn't even over and i've thought about things more than i ever wanted to. First of all-I realized who my true friends are. There are those that I miss, those that merely crossed my mind, and those that annoy me from halfway across the country. lol. no names will ever be mentioned. enough of that. i'm sitting at the kitchen table with my uncle's laptop. This house is amazingly decorated with an assortment of yellows and bright white cabinets. My parents and aunt and uncle are out on the patio, listening to frank sinatra, sipping elegant drinks while overlooking the pool and gazebo. Must be a hard life for my aunt and uncle. On the extreme other end. My other uncle lives in a little shack up on the side of a mountain. He's the caretaker for his neighbors horses, llamas, and dogs and quite possibly the happiest man alive. He's been pretty sick lately. The doctors dont know whats wrong with him. He went to the emergency room yesterday to find out that now he has some sort of virus that i cant even pronounce. So he's been stuck in his bed on the mountain for another week. Then there's Gram. That lady loves me more than anyone in the world and I love her even more for it. So while my friends were having drunken fun at a porn star party...i was sitting discontented on the second floor of a retirement home watching Meet the Parents with my parents and grandma, thinking how much this sucked...until i realized what a little brat i was being. Obviously, I should be continually thanking god that my grandma and both my parents are still here. *i've made it this far without crying a single tear. I sure'd hate to break down here*- julie roberts hmm, weird entry. i dont know if i like it."

So we went over to the Coffee Shop, but improv didnt start until 9 and we didn't want to wait around. So we drove back to Elhumrst and went to Scoops N More. Then Vince drove us around in his hot firebird. It was Brad's 18th birthday so we stopped by his b-day bash at Fishers. Good old Bizzle. Chris Libbey was there. He's leaving for the Marines on Sunday so we said our goodbye's which was sad. But later I received a drunk phone call from him at 2:30 in the morning. I wonder what that was about...i didn't answer.

I love getting ready for dances because it makes me feel like a princess. When else can a girl get her nails and hair done, and put too much make-up on, and then top it off with an oscar dress. The dance itself was awesome. You know you have the perfect date when every dance is happy - whether happy means romantic, scandalous, or just plain fun. And what an honor to be crowned Prom queen. There's something I'll remember for the rest of my life. Not only that, but Art being the King was so cool. i can't think of a better kid to represent our class than Art. 

The post-prom activities put the icing on the cake. mmmmm...and i love icing. haha  everything about the trip to the dells was excellent. the weather was glorious...including that thunderstorm.  shout out to the big guy upstairs for that one. 

I'm beyond glad we had such a great time guys. You're all awesome and we need to do it again sometime...or something of the sort. And an extra special thanks to my hot date for making it an all around amazing time."

So after a fun afternoon, i picked up my car from kirby's and drove caroline home. driving down harvard, she said something along the lines of ""ughh, you have to be kidding me"" (talking about the kid walking down the sidewalk). me and my wonderful vision didn't realize it was him until we were close. he waved, i waved. and we went on our ways. but after only a block i broke down. i dont know why. i can handle these situations. why was this different? i suppose it was because it was unexpected. but, stupid right? you waved at each other and that made you tear up...what a pussy. lol i know. so C and i stopped at the red park and had a nice chat at the sunny picnic table, me in my cotton sun-dress, she in her hot little black number. after a lot of deserved laughter, and we came to this duel-conclusion: one asshole is going off to the marines and the other one is not invited to my graduation party. so there."

That lasted all day until around 5 if i remember correctly. props to the lady warriors who took first. Oh yeah baby. Surprisingly, after about 17 games of badminton i really wasnt tired. dont get me wrong right now my legs are killing me and i'm dead, but for some reason i dont feel like sleeping. i think i'm bored with myself. i feel like i should change somehow. not for someone else, and hardly even for myself, but maybe just because i've always been me, maybe i'm just boring. this doesnt make any sense. Anyways, so i had a few possible options for entertainment tonight. my plans fall through, always always, no matter what. So i ended up going to bakers square and driving around for a long time with sara and katie. we actually had a lot of fun though. those two are absolutely hilarious, and i thinkt thats the closest i've come to peeing my pants from laughing so hard. what were we laughing about...ya know, i dont think i could even tell you, but whatver it was it must have been really funny. 
        So i went to go listen to this CD today. its a burned CD and has no writing on it. then i realized it definitely wasnt mine. the first couple songs were dave mathews. i figured out the last time i had listened to my CD was in january when we went to augie. so aaron and i figured it out. i have his ""special"" cd that he's been looking for for quite some time now, and hopefully my ""special"" cd is floating around  his dorm room somewhere. Speaking of augie...poor johnny boy. If being sick doesnt suck enough, being away from school and friends probably isnt all that great either. So we all hope for a quick recovery for you buddy. 
      PS. i hate people without vaginas. aka boys. they all suck, besides the ones who dont, obviously. But aside from them, i seriously dont understand how so many of them can be so stupid. oh well, its beyond me i suppose. perhaps i'm biased because i'm stuck at willowbrook where the male selection is so limited that you'd think that there was some sort of repulsive quality test that they all had to take in order to enter our school. hmm, good theory anna."

Since thursday at around 3 o'clock i've been pretty smiley. i'm liking this whole four-day weekend ordeal. plus, the weather is absolutely gorgeous. i can actually go running outside again. yesterday i layed out in the sun for an hour...thats right, in my swim suit. haha sure it was a little bit chilly, but felt so good. Last night after the basketball game, i saw Havana Nights, the new Dirty Dancing movie. It was amazing! we all walked out of the theater dancig. :) I'm definitely up for some cool dance lessons now. salsa anyone? i'm serious. 
   So next week is turnabout. i bought some cute shoes to match my dress today, and i made the reservations for 18 people at Buca di Beppo. Hopefully that'll work out. We still haven't figured out what to do after the dance yet, nor have we decided if we even want to hang out with the guys or not. lol  it's all good though, i'm not worried about it. 
   Badminton starts on monday! that's in two days!!! I'm pretty excited about the season. i think it'll be lot of fun. i'm just hoping there wont be a lot of stupid girly fights among teamates, because that would definitely take some of the fun out of the sport.

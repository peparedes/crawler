"event","Charles is finally here! We did a lot after he arrived with his mom. Here is a recap:

Friday, Dec 2 - Met him and his mom at their hotel for the first time! We went to eat dinner at a Thai restaurant. Then drove his mom back to the hotel so we can go and drop off my car somewhere out of downtown. The parking at the hotel cost about $30 USD! I was like...HELL NO! So we parked it somewhere near a subway station, which is free, so that we could go on the subway back to the hotel. It was only a 10 minute commute back to the hotel anyway and it saved us $30. I spent the night at the hotel with them.

Saturday, Dec 3 - Showed Charles and Auntie our new apartment. They seem to like the place. We then went to the bank to get Charles his new bank account. Then I drove them to the nearby Costco to do some shopping. Boy can these two shop! They filled up 3 carts and the bill was $$$$!!!! Everybody was looking at us at the cashier! The challenge was how to transport all these merchandises back home in my little Accord. We filled the whole trunk, loaded the vacant seat in the back and then have Auntie sit in the car before we load more stuff on top of her. We should've taken some pictures of the situation. It was kinda funny. 

Sunday, Dec 4 - Another shopping day. After eating lunch, we went and got Charles a cellphone plan. After walking around the area, Auntie didn't feel that well so we drove her home. We then went to Walmart to buy more stuff. Yes, we filled the car again! Luckily Auntie didn't go with us or else we couldn't have fit all the stuff in the car, even if we put some on her again. Well, it's mostly because we got some plastic drawers, which are bulky.

Monday, Dec 5 - Went to work. After work, I went to Walmart again with Charles to pick up more merchandise. We bumped into the same cashier lady who rang us up the night before. She was surprised that we went back for more. We again packed the whole car. This is like the most shopping I've ever done.

Tuesday, Dec 6 - Went to work again. Went home and waited for one of my friend to drive her car over so we can pick up some big stuff from Walmart AGAIN. This time, I purposely avoided the same cashier lady cuz I felt embarrassed about our shopping sprees. After picking up the big stuff, we went to eat dinner and went back home.

Wednesday, Dec 7 - Went to work. Chilled at home for the night. We needed some rest from all that shopping. I helped out on putting the new furniture that we bought from Walmart together. These are the furniture that come in boxes and are broken down into thousands of pieces. It took a long time to put them all together. I was very proud of Charles and Auntie cuz they actually put together most of the furniture during the time that I was at work!

Thursday, Dec 8 - Work again. Then picked up Charles and Auntie to eat dinner with Joan.

Friday, Dec 9 - Work again. After work, picked up Charles and Auntie to eat in the city with one of my friends.

Saturday, Dec 10 - Went to an eat-all-you-can sushi place an hour away from home with Charles, Auntie and two other friends. It's located at where I used to go to college. There was a long line and we had to wait for 2 hours. My friend and I were standing at the list so we can hear them call our name for a table. During the wait, this guy (let's call him the stupid guy) went up to the list and inserted his name on top. There were two ladies standing with us and they were upset but didn't do anything. I grabbed the pen and scratched his name off and told one of the waiters. Here's the dialog between me and the stupid guy:
     Stupid guy: Why the fuck did you tell on me?
     Me: We all have to wait for our table. It's no fair that you try to cut all of us. You should wait too.
     Stupid guy: Well, I don't fuckin care about you guys.
     Me: Well, too bad. You will have to wait.
     Stupid guy: Well, you better watch your back. You are gonna get your fuckin ass kicked.
At this point, I turned around and ignored him. When my other friend came in, I told her about it and she dogged at him the whole time. She purposely walk past him to give him the evil look. After we got the table, I told Charles and he told me to point the stupid guy out to him. We couldn't find the stupid guy. Maybe he left because he was afraid that we know that he was bluffing and that we will in turn kick his ass. HAHA. After sushi, we went to a Casino so Auntie can look at how the casinos here are like. We went home afterward. My two friends slept over.

Sunday, Dec 11 - The five of us went to have dim sum. This was the last full day that we had with Auntie until her next visit. She said she needed to pick up some last minute stuff from downtown so we went back to the city. I dropped them off so I could look for parking. I felt guilty that Auntie paid for most of our meals when we ate out so I felt that I should get her something that she likes. After I found parking, I decided to go and get a couple one pound boxes of Sees Chocolate for her so she can enjoy on the plane. When I met up with them at a Cafe, Auntie surprised me with an early Christmas gift at the same time I surprised her with my Sees Chocolate. It made me felt extra guilty. Here, I was trying to compensate for some of the meals she treated with my Sees Chocolate and now she over-compensated my Chocolate with the gift. The gift made my Sees Chocolate looked cheap. But thanks Auntie! I really appreciate the gift and all the stuff you've done to make Charles' stay possible.

Monday, Dec 12 - At work now. Will go to dinner with Charles and Auntie before dropping her at the airport. I hope to see her soon. I will miss her."

"event","Do you have spirits in your home? Someone told me that he has spirits in his home and they have been bugging him lately by misplacing his things. He also told me that he sometimes sees them in his room. I was totally freaked out after hearing about this. However, he said that it is pretty normal to have spirits in your house. Later, I asked someone else about this and she also told me that she has spirits in her house too. Now I'm extra freaked out! Could there be spirits in my house? I get so paranoid now! Whenever I'm alone in my house, I always look around to see if I am really alone, if you know what I mean. ARGH! Yes, I'm a scaredy cat. =("

"event","It is finally the beginning of the school year and Joan just arrived here for college. I was really happy to see her because she reminds me of my trip in the Philippines. Finally, a familiar face from Manila. I really miss Manila. Actually, I miss the people in Manila more than the place itself. Especially Charles and his few close friends (Kevin, Rocky, Poma, and Joma). They really made my trip much more enjoyable. I would like to thank them for their time spent with me. 

For the past couple of days, I went shopping after work with Joan and Uncle Albert for school supplies. It's fun shopping for school supplies when you are not the one who is going to school. My college years were hell, with lots to do so I totally hated my college years. Hopefully, Joan will enjoy herself in college. I will do my best to help her in anyway, since she is far away from her home, from her family, from her friends.

I hope I will see more familiar faces from Manila soon. I miss you all so much!"

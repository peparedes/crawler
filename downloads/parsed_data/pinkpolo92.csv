I was pissing myself laughing so hard XD Tom was all, ""well thats not very nice, do it again."" So he did - but worse :P So tom just gave up and started the intro. Hehe. &lt;3<br /><br />&nbsp;McFLY. Okay, my mum was talking to their stage dudes. I dunno what they're called D: And they were talking about ""Dannys fetish for checkered shirts"" haha. And what was it? Oh yeah. ""Low flying bread rolls and food fights."" And something else...Oh yeah. Alchybooze :P Wheee. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Soooo.

""Go round the back!"" came a familiar voice and so she did. It was a hot day, cloudless day on the out skirts of London. As she walked around the house, she could her stiffled giggles but saw nothing due to the high fence surrounding Dougies garden. Slowly she turned the door nob on the gate and stuck her head round the corner...Nothing. Thinking nothing of it she opened the gate wider and confidently walked through into the garden. Big mistake. <br /><br />""Surprise!"" Shouted an excited Dougie as he aimed his water gun at her and sprayed - getting her soaked.<br />She screamed with anger, which turned into giggles as Dougie continued to spray, showing no signs of stopping,or running out of water, anytime soon. ""Perfect day for a water fight, what do you say?"" he asked through giggles. ""Well, you think you can get me soaked to the skin, and me to <b>not</b> get you back? Silly boy."" she replied laughing. Dougie just giggled and chucked another water gun at her, which had been sitting at his feet the whole time. ""Try your worse then, you'll have to catch me first!"" He shouted, and like an excited little boy, he sped off around the garden, whilst Lauren chased him giggiling madly. <br /><br />After about half an hour Dougie stuck his head up from behind a wall, and was faced with a rather angry looking Lauren, who still had half her water left. ""I surrender! Im all outta water Loz!"" Lauren just laughed at his misfortune, ""That's such a shame Doogle, I still have quite a bit left you see, and Im planning to put it to good use!"" She hear dougie gasp as she spoke, ""B-but, that's not fair!"" <br />""Neither was you spraying me when I walked in just now, I didn't know what you were planning did I?"" Dougie looked at his feet before he spoke, ""I guess so...but it's still not fair! Im already pretty wet, and my shirt will go see through! You wouldn't want that now would you?"" Lauren just shrugged, ""incase you hadn't noticed, im wetter than you, and I've already gone see through! Now, I'll do a deal with you."" Dougie nodded as he listened intently to what she had to say. ""You get me some clean, dry clothes, and I won't get you wet...well...that wet anyway."" Dougie laughed, fine, fine, just don't get me wet again once im changed. Come in then, put the gun down!"" He said as she followed him. ""Bleh, you're no fun. I had an unfair advantage Dougie Lee."" she stuck my tounge out at him as he glared at me from using his middle name. Putting the gun next to Dougies, she followed him into his flat where she spent the rest of the dancing, singing, playing and just generally being stupid.</font></div>"

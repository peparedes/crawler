The fair with Jenny. We made friends with a man named Rudy that only communicated through a peice of paper and a pen. (photobucket has terrible picture quality.)

Pisces (Feb 19 - Mar 20) 
Home and family responsibilities are distracting you from things you wish you could do. Parental duties may call, whether or not you have children of your own, for you are attracted now to the kind of security that a child should have in early life. You may want to create this for yourself or someone else. Either way, it's a good idea to honor the ideal mother and father, even if they are not your real parents."

When something fades away it sort of starts eating me up inside and tugs at my insides. At this point I'm not really sure as of what else to do, how to stop myself, or how else to feel other than nostalgic. Thanks for your time."

"event","I actually didn't get to see this ""terrible band"" that we were planning on seeing. Though I had such a great time last friday. It was such a great escapade, and it just makes me so excited for the summer. At first we decided to go to Buffalo Exchange to spend the little money that we had just for the heck of it, and it was amazingly hilarious and fun. I bought myself a nice, cute grandma wallet. We then went to Native Foods, which was actually pretty good! I had tacos that really weren't tacos! Thinking we were early we took the 405 freeway and after about 20 minutes...""Stephanie, was it the 5 freeway or the 405?"". Take the exit and come all the way back to where we started, drive around in Sanda Ana asking people at stop lights, it takes me about 10 minutes to park my car at the tiniest gas station in the world where there are 20 pumps cramped together. Finally find the freeway, go see a very good band, see George(though not for long), drive back to Stephanie's. Soak our feet by the pool, sleep sleep sleep. go home!

I've pretty much given up in school.

"event","I'm going to see a horrible band tonight, which I guess is A-Okay because I get to see George(he is driving from Vegas). Wahoo. I'm very excited for the summer, and I don't know what to expect. I just love that summer feeling, and smell, and warmness, and the rattling of the airconditioner. I hope I start my exciting escapade of intending to have an amazing, life changing experience. I've got everything, I just have to make something of it. 

My dad called me this morning, and now I don't really know what to expect of the next few months. I don't know where I'm going to live, or if I'm going be living with my mother or not. He doesn't even know about it yet, and something inside of me just crumples and crimples and squizzes itself when he mentions coming back or just having to do things to my room or around the house, because in the back of my head I know that I won't be living with him anymore. I mean, I don't know it's just so hard. Sometimes I feel like I am too considerate of him but then again I should be because he is my dad. Right? mph!  

I'm finally saving up for my cameeeraaaaa!"

"event","It's surprising how much of an effect a nine-year-olds opinion could have. I ran barefoot out of the house yesterday to get my books out of my car, and as I am doing so a little boy is scootering and he looks at me and tells me that I look pretty. It's not important, and getting compliments is never important to me yet he said it in such a way, so unexpectedly. I thought it was nice and cute. 

After I performed at an instrumental concert, I took a nightwalk with Ruby. It was quite dark and misty. You know, the perfect night weather where everyone is inside enjoying a nice television set. I ran through the field with him a little bit before coming home and looking through some of my AOFU packets and deals. 

I think I might be getting an idea of what I'd like to do with my life. I'm not going to worry myself to death about it yet. I'm going to be spontaneous, and adventurous. I'm going to take a few risks and see where they take me. Worrying about where I'm going to be in 4 years is too overwhelming therefore I'm going to just take it 4 months at a time.

And as for other things;It's amazing how slowly things begin to fall into place and how I can almost tell what is real and what isn't."

"event","You know when you watch your mother, your sister or even your best friend cry over somebody as you sit there, feeling helpless all the while never thinking of yourself being in any given situation like that. Or let's say you watch one of those really secretly-enjoyable movies like ""The Sisterhood of The Traveling Pants"" thinking, this is crap. Nothing like that ever happens in real life. Correct? Well, that has been kind of how I've been feeling lately. You know? Most of the time I don't really feel that I am in my own skin or if I am really here. So many changes have  been happening, and I feel myself becoming older and becoming more experienced, and somewhat wiser. I'm having more responsibilities and real things are happening now, I'm not just imagining anymore. I am slowly growing into the person that I will someday become and it's just so overwhelming that it's finally come, so far and so fast and I'm having to finally make decisions for myself and others and that is somewhat of a scary thing. My Dad is now a married man, and he hasn't told me yet."

You like spells, herbs,<br>maybe even voodoo-dolls. You like it very much,<br>and probably even have books or found<br>Internet-sites where magic is the topic. You<br>probably mean no harm with this, well perhaps<br>to some. Most people who are aware of your<br>interest mistakes you for a Satan-worshipper.<br>You're missunderstood, but have your friends.<br>You probably are a wiccan or something related<br>and are interested in mother nature, souls and<br>spirits. You prefer the forrest(or park) before<br>the city. Remember, all can't always<br>understand.

This is very true because I embrace Wiccan. I lets me feel connected to something graeater then myself and this plane of reality (this world)."

But your depression has caused you to<br>become an outcast. You love to be by yourself,<br>as it helps you think. You have always, and<br>always will wonder what has gone wrong. Your<br>soul has been shattered, and your wings are in<br>peices. But that's just you. You spend your<br>days searching for something. Not someone.<br>Though you don't know what you are looking for.<br>You don't even remember who you are. And are<br>always trying to find that person, yourself,<br>your soul. Which seems to have been misplaced.

But. When you find what you are looking for, it<br>will become clear. All tragedy will be ripped<br>from your wings, and your true colours will<br>show. And then, you are the most powerful of<br>them all.

Hang on, keep looking for it is there. Just try not<br>to loose all you hope and become nothing. For<br>you are truly beautiful.

Two Questions, Lita:

1) Are you going to play sports? If yes, which ones?



2) What classes are you going to take next year?


Well, I have got to go. Class is almost over.  

Adios, mi amiga, (Bye my friend)"

Angry Souls arent always<br>angry, but they cannot easily forgive and hold<br>grudges. You probably often get in fights with<br>your friends and family, and its difficult for<br>you to understand. When someone makes a<br>mistake, you dont let go easily and hold on to<br>those memories. Your very stubborn and your<br>rage is known to everyone. Though you never<br>actually mean it, you can say mean things in a<br>fight and go over board. Many people are<br>sometimes intimidated by your anger. But you<br>have many redeeming qualities and those are<br>that you are quite intelligent and smart. You<br>would make a good businesswoman or lawyer<br>because you know how to prove your point. You<br>cherish the ones around you, and appreciate<br>life, even though you can complain or throw a<br>tantrum now and then. The good things is, you<br>keep your emotions very outspoken, and are<br>normally a very happy person because all your<br>rage is let on the outside. Anger is simply a<br>state, but you, yourself as a person, are<br>great.

By being a dragon you are a little cruel<br>and evil on the outside but if someone gets to<br>know you you are actually kinda nice (with a<br>few quirks) You will stand up for your friends<br>even though sometimes you prefer to be alone.<br>You like to be a little different form those<br>around you and don't usually let what ppl say<br>get on your nerves to much.
Some things that describe you include:
Element(s)- fire and ice (a little bit of dark here<br>and there too)
Animal- any of the big cats though most preferably<br>a tiger
Color- Bold colors
Stone- bloodstone
Qoute- 'I would rather be hated for who I am then<br>loved for who I am not.'

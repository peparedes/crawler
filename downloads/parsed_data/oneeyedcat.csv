in other news, today I bought a big ass pot so that I can make pot roast the proper way with an obscene amount of potatoes for Sas. without leaving out the carrots that only I like. mmmm roasty!

it looks like this: http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=119064&CategoryID=14349
 only it's an 8qt pot...IT'S GIANT! Also it was on super sale.. more the half the sale price on the site linked, which means I got a giant pot for a giant deal. It's beauteous and no, i do not know what has happened to me. I've turned into a big softy, cooking, cooing idiot.  Weez thinks it's adorable, but that only make the self loathing worse. It's getting to the point that I'm going to have to punch something ridiculously cute in the face in order to feel like myself again. Where are you pissy ishka?  

anyway enjoy the shamwow song, it's the best."

"event","&nbsp;So....I've been tagged and will do my best. I don't think I'm very wild and crazy......sure,&nbsp; I'm a complete loon but not ""wild"" or ""crazy"". am I? I even tried seeing what other people said to get an idea of what kind of wild and crazy facts we're going for but i still don't know. just gonna wing it.

1. Few things terrify me more than Flesh Eating Bacteria and also Barry Manilow. 

2. I'm obsessed with cleanliness and hygiene.&nbsp; I like to keep my living space neat and sometimes I vacuum for fun. I like doing the dishes it's very zen.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a little OCD when it comes to washing my hands. (if i see something gross, even if I didn't touch it I have to wash my hands. HAVE TO!)

3. I like to test myself by either doing things that scare the crap out of me (I face my fear of heights almost every year. I don't know why, it never goes away.)  or that are completely new. I always try to be up for an adventure and open to new experiences. Life's too short not to tell your comfort zone to suck it.&nbsp; I also like it when I do something so unexpected of me that my family/friends think I'm lying until I prove it. good times!&nbsp; 

4. I don't want to have children. Pregnancy seems absolutely unnatural and creepy to me. To have a person, growing in your body...eeew. That's like some alien shizz and I don't deal with that. It's like being taken over or something, things moving around all alive within you. GROSS! I would constantly be afraid that it's tiny little fist would burst through my abdomen all bloody and covered with womb juice. Barf city yo. 

5. I think I would probably be ok with losing a limb. It wouldn't shatter me. But I don't think I'd want a prosthetic that looked like a real arm or leg. I'm fine with a stick or metal rod or a wicked awesome hook. I'm all about keepin it real and cyborgin it. (and i think that last sentence is hilarious!!!.&nbsp; if anyone could ""keep it real"" while ""cyborgin it"" you must admit, it would be me!)
&nbsp;5.5: If I was paralyzed like from the chest down, could not deal with that. Please pull the plug. Unless there isn't a plug, and then just smother me or something. use your imagination. As long as you aren't going to stab me, I'll be ok. (do these count as facts? in case it doesn't I'll do a sixth.)

6. I really love learning about infectious diseases and then claiming to get them/worry about having them. I've had bird flu like 4 times this year. the best part is that most strange west nile-bird flu-denbolas all start out like a cold. so anytime I come down with something I claim which ever one has had an outbreak recently. good times.&nbsp; 

no tags. anyone who hasn't done this and feels like it -give us 5 wild &amp; crazy facts, GO!


(i wondered what mom's would be so I went to ask her and we decided I'll help her post her list tomorrow. )"

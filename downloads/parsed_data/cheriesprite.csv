"event","the one the best things life has to offer is the EnJoY that pops up on my microwave after i hit the popcorn bag is done. the trick to get it to say that though is you really have to hit the popcorn one-touch button. my buttery fingers are sticking to my keyboard on top of it; but i still am enjoying it. i always used to eat butter popcorn, but then  i stoped for two years with all popcorn in general. Then in the 9th grade i had an older friend who only ate (pause as the other half of the bag is in my mouth) non-buttered, plain popcorn. she enjoyed this, so i ate popcorn again, her way, nonbuttered and plain. to this day i think of her when i see unbuttered,super plain popcorn. then for some reason i picked up the superbuttered popcorn habit again. im not friends i suppose you could say with her anymore either. but now i can appresate(spelling on that???) the enjoy thing also, which i never did before or after the plain popcorn episode. does anyone follow me on my popcorn theory???"

"event","so its really snowing out here. my girl jessie and i were  snowed in the entire day.

and reading has made me done some thinking; i really dont even know what but i believe im trying to dig up something in the past.i was going thorough a not a former friend, but i suppose a friend from a while ago entries. and i remember when she wrote her first one and that was her junior year and my freshmen. I think back to then and its so long ago but then again that was my only other highschool ish experience in a way since iwas locked up my 10th grade year. its almost as if im still picking up from that year, the end of my freshmen but now im only a junior and 16. like i dont know exacatly how to word what i want to say. i dont even know what mad me go back. my  friend jessie wiped out one particular cd that my friend and  i used to listen to NON-stop and it kinda freaked me out. i remember dancing around her room to these songs freshly just high. i remember it like yesterday and i was retartedly high but i still rememeber. andn ow it brings me back to now; i can only visit this past in my memories and no where else. im no longer anything like i was back then but i dont know who i am. i feel since i got out of that place im still trying to pick (insert pause of time here cos i just realized that i put hairdye in my hair and its been like a hour.)(back)something out. i think thought maybe i need to try out still living the status quo high school life as much as i dont want to. maybe im trying to move to fast to get away from it but maybe i need it to get from one place to another. i sure many would agree with me on this. i have to go through the toutrue of it all cos thats just how it is. though im not usually theone to go for things of just how they are. 

my friend had the same bond with trees that i have at this age and i read through her justafcations at 16 and i couldnt agree anymore; today her views are different and maybe ill be there in my future. i admire her, as i always have (maybe almost like an oldersiste)to this day; i want to almost go the same direction with my life the whole college thing as her; but then again i dont want to. i dont think ill be done  partying when i turn 18 but only merly start as another friend of mine who turned 18. these two friends are the same age but took totally different paths in life. i sit here comparing and trying to figure out which one i will fall in. i think though the best bet for me is just to let go of it all and let maybe my soul find its own way. maybe my heart needs to lead me instead of my head. i mean for all i know i could be a mom at 18 and not chose either of those( NOT implying anything). 

and one last thing; what dents my  uprise is that i love my downfall."

like you would think things about everyone being at college and have the time of their life and dit dita da would make me want to do something; it i think actually does the opposite for me. i dont want to go to like some huge college with like a billion people and frats and UGH. yuk. 
in a sense it makes me what to puke. 
and it doesnt bother me that i wont amount to much more then like the top shot girl at some strip bar.it really doesnt. i think i would be a lot happier doing that then the whole college shit.

so as this songs says, we all have to die sometime. Nice realty check eh?

my tiny head hurts. Stress. Devon. Death. Love. Lust. Hate. Passion. life..

dreams i believe hold some type of wisdom. I believe. I had a bad trip. I cheated with someones boyfriend. I smoked. I rode the waves. I rode the rides. I picked gum out of my hair. Everything was smooth. I had a best friend. I had breath.
What possesses me to have such wondering thoughts? is the force of the thunder i hear now? Is it the water i so relate to? is it the fire that had died in me? or is it a sprite which yet still is being formed?                  im not sure. i wish i knew. I would be able to  uncomplate things so much easier.




bark at me all you want. I care of nothing for you. 

All i need is one mic, one beat.


i need a cigarette . 


i believe im off now.

aw!





hm, if she was so ""over"" this, why would she devote a whole page to me? i wonder; but thats all i can do. 

I'm not proud of what i did but, like i said before, im not sorry at that either. 

As for being in common, we became friends before we smoked 2gether so in all fact we must have had SOMETHING in common.And if when i asked her was our friendship stronger then weed, she agreed that it was. In fact a lie on her part. i wish she would go ahead and call my mum. Ive told her everything, i have nothing to hide. Also, im not pushing anyone away. The only ones i am are my parents which is undoubtfully understandable. Im not going to justif myself in this cos i dont have to. Like i said to Sharif. 

As for her little advice in this unpresident war : Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder. I am beautiful in my own way and so are you.i am at peace with myself at last. I dont hold the key to the locks in life, but i will somehow break though them. And as for trying so hard, What for? i will not know any of you in three years. I will be fully free for the lies and the greed of others in this town. But now, the closest thing to that is going to europe for the summer :D


As for me thinking you have a problem lady, thats left up for me to ponder. I have my own reasons as to why so. As in company in rehab, im leaving in 5weeks. Whats the point?

As now to this sentence, i'm saying my final goodbye. We had our times and all in done. I hope you ripp though life as a jagged knife you've become. So long.

Every so often just sit down and think. Think about where your going. I wish someone had given me that advice a long time ago. But, thats the past. You are the future.

ramble ramble ramble on; I dont know who i am. I've lost myself in the mase of lines and dots. POP! goodnight.

Hope and dream all  you want, you will never get it. NEVER. Be careful in what you do; dont write a suidice note. Be open.

Inhale the beauty that will kill one day.Pass a rock. Flick a ciggerate.Sniff that line. It will do you good; for the least time.

"event","god, what a good week. i need this. i need to smoke. And i did. Actully way to much in one week. But yet again, like i said, it was a really good week. I wont get into details cos that would take up half the fucking day, but it also was somewhat of a funny week. Just plain funny, and good, of course.

So, now im sitting here with a green mask stuck on my face. It feels tingy :o)  <-- i like that face, heehz. But back to what Im thinking, yesterday man, yessterday was amazing. I smoked so much. I dont think i can begin to count. I went to yasi's, and suppiled munchies which cost me $60. Fucking food prices. So then we smoked my weed and rolled a joint. I brought about $60 worth of shit too.mwahhaha go me. So we smoked. Then we smoked some more and then, WE SMOKED JUST INCASE we didnt smoke enough before. But then a bit later on we smoked. So it was good. So then linday and christina lee come to yasi's. Linday was a kind hearted soul and walked me down to the highschool where i was supposed to be picked up. I havnt gotten around to telling my mother i quit the play so she thinks im still going to practices. It all works out. So my mum gets there but before she did, we came up to a plan: we would go back to my home, then eat, then go to lindays then back to yasi's then smoke again. It somewhat worked out. It worked out to the part where we got back to yasi's. We stayed for a few mintues. She was sleeping, burnt and being kinda bichty towards us. (no offence or anything man, i still luv ya) So then chris stayed and then linday i went down and walked to metro plants. We were hoping WEED see jeff and pete. Pete wasnt there, but jeffy was. So we begged him to get us stuff to smoke. Lindays didnt smoke all day and i was just starting to come down so i need something to pick me up again. So we just waited around and planted flowers in pots for jeff. haha i actully enjoyed that but its funny when you are high. ohh boy.. haha newayz so then my mum calls me on my cellie and was like WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?>! im like eh, metro and then i make up this laborious excuse to why i was there and not watching dvds at lindays.. so shes like im picking you up. Im like uh ok. so i tell lindays to come over like later on to sleep over. But i have spoken to her since. But newayz, i get home put my bag down in my room and leave to go online and make plans for the later part of the night. This is where it gets interesting...

My mother had gone though my bag.I should have none this.Shes maybe almost does it everyday day with my bag and room.She thinks i dont know. God, damnit then she wonders why i lie to her and why we have no trust. Shes always screaming at me she has no trust in me but like what the fuck?? how amm i supposed to trust you! Trust happens to be a toway think you know. but yet again in my mother's eyes, that doesnt belong....on with it.. She found my bowl, my cigg fliter which may i say could be used for j's or blunts, and two condoms. Why i was carring condoms, i have no fucking clue. I just had them from a very long time ago.They just happened to creep into my bag. Or maybe, maybe my subconsence was hoping to get some ass. But, like yea right. Thats another entry. But back to the story, she was somewhat pissed and was like jasmina what the hell what the hell. That was the end of it. Nothing more of it. Im not punished or anything. <---that is the interesting part of the story. For me, at least.

So later on the night was good too. My friend came and picked me up at like 12.It was really funny*even to me* that i was so burnt i had a problem trying to walk out the door without making any noise. My parents didnt no i was going of course. but it was quit amuzing seen. lol  We smoked straight untill 3. God it was great. Then i came home and slept. :D

So i also have come to desided that bowls are bad luck for me. At least ones that i buy. I think its just cursed upon me. I think im going to stick to the soda can. Works greatly and you get a drink outta it. What better could that be? besides its cheaper so you have more money for weed. Think about it. NO hassle with screens, or cleaning out you bowl, you dont have to pay like $30 for a really good one, can get they almost anywhere in the world, and its not werid to go buy one just incase your parents find it! haha!

hmm so i think im pretty much done. im going to go like try to get this mask off my face now. its been on to long cos i was writing in here. meh!

jazzy

plur

"event","good morning.. im up really early.. i took a run, then a shower, and now im here. fun fun.. newayz nothing new i gueses but i dunno as i was taking a shower this morning i had a million racing thoughts on my mind as if i was coked-up and it was werid cos as thouse thoughts ran by me i could hear my heart beat and my breath catching up to the maddness.. i felt like it was sereal (idkhow t o spell it;imhorrible speller) then i got out and it  calmed down but started up again.. again i could feel the thoughts running past me not making any logical sense when put 2gether but this time i felt my skin dry up and lose its moistness so i hurried to put cream on it to restore its waters but as i rubbed my skin i realized that this wasnt me; it was someone else skin.. whos a stanger to my mind. or maybe my minds a stanger to my skin. either way. or just maybe its all made up.. maybe im imagining everything. i think im comforable. but yet again maybe thats just my mind taking over my all my humamly sences. And maybe the wispers that speak to me are my sences telling me to come back. 

maybe,

but how should i know?

"event","oh boy.. so i after i dropped sasha home we went to go to pathmark to get like flowers and stuff for my aunt.. but we went to the pathmark in bellieve (another old town of mine) and stuff and my mum yelled atthe guy to ope nthe door cos they were closed and she was already in a pissy mood to begin with.. i felt bad for the guy but i laughed.. if he only knew thats what i had to deal with on an everyday basis.. so we get to my aunts.. we make it thou drinks and dinner then actully this time we set a record time!! we made it into 2minutes of dersert! that hasnt happned in a very long time.. well, my mum and grandmum started fighting about my grandfather or something; then my aunt and uncle started fighting about the fucking dog...it was really retarded man

newayz so now im tring to get ppl to comme over or something cos i dont have a ride anywehre.. it fucking blows; i wanna drive damn it! but argh.. newayz at least i made plans 2morow with yasi.. we are gonna go out for breakfast!1 I LOVE GOING OUT TO BREAKFAST! its the best meal to et something to eat for! mwahahhaha yay!!

ah, so as we were driving thou my old towns, i felt a sense of weridness... it was like i used to live there.. i mean i grew up playing joperope in a parking lot *when i was lucky enought to do that* i mean it was just werid.. i mean not to sound jappy or something but uh i used live where a shit load of white trash lives now. the thing is i remember it different. maybe cos it was different, i guess. whatever. but it was just weird i guess.. ugh. now i remembered why i moved around so much. it was cos my parents were ALWAYS getting separted.. it fucking blowed. i was little and to young to understand the fullest details like now but i still had feelings about it. now, i think ive just become numb from the world and myself. ha, its so wonderful to feel nothing; but yet again that just contradicted what i said. hm. but back to it, my parents i think might get separted again. i know this. i know the cycle all to well now. to be point blank, im tired of it all. all they do is fight; and then when they start talking about selling the house or putting it on the market it means that they wanna move somewhere else ""to start over again fresh and new"". but this time buddy, this time im not going to go along with it. i want to finish s chool in one fucking place already. im tired of everything. i hate it so much. ugh; maybe im overreacting. hopefully i am. i want to overreact. i love to ovverreact, it makes me feel somewhat listened to, i guess. im just lonly, unnoticed person. i feel like im pushed into the coner and my thoughts dont count when it comes to them moving around. i hate it. i hope that doesnt happpen...

or maybe, 

maybe i just want to die?

i think i want to die. i wouldnt have to deal with them or you.

stop it now.

"event","oh what a glorious day its going to be.. ha

lets see last night sasha slept over.. we watched memento- that is some twisted ingenius shit right there.. its my second time watching it and im still in awe. mwah. we also rented CUBE- but we fell asleep before we got around to watching it.. next time i suppose..

so in other news.. yasi called me last night.. the poor eskimo got held up at her job.. damn black people.. not that i have anything against them.. i love black people.. its just a couple that i like.. otherwise i cant stand them (they way they act).. oi... JUST  please dont get me wrong.. i really do like some of them.. i mean aziz, my prom date is black!

so i had another great dream last night.. it was this tiny dog chasing me down my old block in newark.. go figure... it was trying to bite me and iw as running a way from it.. now like i said yesterday i think dreams represent something happening in your life or whats going to happen.. you jsut have to puzzle them 2gether even thou they dont make any sence at the time being.. back back to my draem of last night.. it think the dog chasing me meant that im trying to get away from something in my life thats old and has been here awhile... i say soemthing old because this took place where i used to live.. maybe it was telling me i want to get away from something in my life and start a new life.. i think this really goes together because yesterdays dream and 2day's dream connect with each other in the fact that i should start a new chapter in my life and get away from the old.. ha god i cant believe you if you actuly read down this far with the crap im writing cos you prob dont really give two shits.. if even one...

umm so now sasha is putting a ball that flashes in front of my face.. and now shes yelling she cnat get it to flash and now shes  pounding it.. hm shes having to much fun ... 

ahh i fought with my mummy this morning when i woke up.. she yelled at me cos she doesnt want yasi callint this ""home"" i told her to fuck off cos we have been thou this about six million times already and i knwo she doesnt like yasi but i do.. so whatever yasi can call all she wants; its not like my mum can stop her or something.. i wish my parents wouldnt be so fucking annoying and rude.. god what harm is it if she calls me?

ah so 2day is easter.. meaning im going over to my aunts and uncles who last years before will get drunk and a fight will break out and my grandmum will start screaming and my mother will start in with the yelling and fighting then we leave before desert... eh.

so i shall write in a bit later.. sasha is getting inpatient; she wants to write in her journaly too...

hm.

ahh so lets see.. what else is there to thikn about.. i think thats about it for 2day.... yasi just IMed me and she thinks my mum reads her diary.. and my mum prob does cos i know my mum read my old one and whatnot and she will prob start reading this one.. but whatever i really dont give a fuck! its gonnen to the point were not much matters to me and i dont really give a shit too much..

Okay so anyways I'm home now, as in FTL. It always feels as if I never left, it's always home here. Grandpa says too many bad words, grandma died her hair so now she looks 50, Diamonde is getting sooooooooo tall, and mom is so active lately. The only thing I can eat here is Pop Tarts and Eggos. Everything else is healthy. Ick. Okay, I think I'm gonna go to bed because it's the only thing to do. I guess I could watch TV. Okay, goodnight."

"event","I've become one of those annoying laptop kids in class! yay! THis is a one time thing. lol. I had to do a paper today. Five hours, nine pages. Yup! 3104 words! It was exhausting and boring as hell. I stayed in one place for the whole time. The second floor of the bookstore where all the seating is. It's so relaxing. Someitmes I cant stand the library, i dont like the lighting and it's too quiet and too cold and it isnt open enough. It was for my film class. We had to analyze a scene from a movie shot by shot! Sooooooooooo boring. I did Back to the Future. I chose the scene where they try out the time machine for the first time. I am so glad I got that paper done. Thank you God! I prayed that I would get it done in ample time and I did, although I waited to do it till the day it was due, I still did it in time. And afterwards I had time to eat and see friends so it's all good. Now I am in my film class and I'm watching this ridiculously weird movie. I dont even know if this is the same movie i started out watching. What the hell is going on? I guess this is the future or something. Maybe I should do this more often. I like writing what is presently happening. It's fun! Brittish accents are awesome. man that bitch is rude. Last week we were watching a filmm clip and my prof. burped into the microphone! He didnt know it was on. Worse yet, he wore a pink hat with a brown houndstooth blazer and dark brown slacks. wtf mate, wtf. Okay, now this old lady is getting her face stretched out. Further than I can stretch mine! What the hell is this movie about? Brittish movies are bloody weird mate. I could go on forever because there's weird shit happening all the time.Whoa, like now. Wow, look at their hair. Mmmmmm, that looks good. Bon jour!!!!!!!!! Okay that's enough goodbye."

Walked out with no shopping bags, yay! everytime I walk away from something I really really really really want to buy, I feel empowered and I also feel like I saved money, lol. I have enough sweaters and that shirt probably wouldnt look good on me anyways. I'm not muscular. There was an overload of nice clothes at the biggest Macy's men's store I've ever seen. They had a seperate store for men that took up the entire floor! Finaly, It seems like woman's clothes are like 75 percent of most dept. stores. Last night was pretty good too, had a long talk with G & S, cleared up a few things. Now I have to pack. Leaving at 9am in the morn. Packing sucks, I just want to go and everything follow behind me. Clothes should have feet. Whatever. Can't wait to get back to tampa, relax and have high speed internet connection again. And my comfortable bed! It'll be awesome."

"event","DID YOU KNOW THIS ABOUT VODKA?



1. To remove a bandage painlessly, saturate the bandage with vodka. The solvent dissolves adhesive.

2. To clean the caulking around bathtubs and showers, fill a trigger-spray bottle with vodka, spray the caulking, let set five minutes and wash clean. The alcohol in the vodka kills mold and mildew.

3. To clean your eyeglasses, simply wipe the lenses with a soft, clean cloth dampened with vodka. The alcohol in the vodka cleans the glass and kills germs.

4. Prolong the life of razors by filling a cup with vodka and letting your safety razor blade soak in the alcohol after shaving. The vodka disinfects the blade and prevents rusting.

5. Spray vodka on vomit stains, scrub with a brush, then blot dry. 

6. Using a cotton ball, apply vodka to your face as an astringent to cleanse the skin and tighten pores.

7. Add a jigger of vodka to a 12-ounce bottle of shampoo. The alcohol cleanses the scalp, removes toxins from hair, and stimulates the growth of healthy hair.

8. Fill a sixteen-ounce trigger-spray bottle and spray bees or wasps to kill them.

9. Pour one-half cup vodka and one-half cup water in a Ziplock freezer bag and freeze for a slushy, refreshable ice pack for aches, pain or black eyes.

10. Fill a clean, used mayonnaise jar with freshly packed lavender flowers, fill the jar with vodka, seal the lid tightly and set in the sun for three days. Strain liquid through a coffee filter, then apply the tincture to aches and pains.

11. To relieve a fever, use a washcloth to rub vodka on your chest and back as a liniment.

12. To cure foot odor, wash your feet with vodka.

13. Vodka will disinfect and alleviate a jellyfish sting.

14. Pour vodka over an area affected with poison ivy to remove the oil from your skin.

15. Swish a shot of vodka over an aching tooth. Allow your gums to absorb some of the alcohol to numb the pain.

16. NEVER DRINK THE STUFF - IT'LL KILL YOU!!"

"event","Going back Jan. 4! It's not like I want to go away early, I just don't want to be here anymore. Does that make sense? My mom is starting to bug me about leaving my shoes downstairs, getting a haircut, wearing sneakers and all that junk. And mostly, I annoy her so I'm sure she wants me to go to, lol. And my bed is too small and my room is uncomfortable and I'm bored all the time and uhhhhhhhhhh, I just want to go. I'm glad I called Dan because I'm sure he wouldn't tell me the date to leave till the night before. But I'm glad I'm going up earlier then I could have cool weather, my special pillow, a comfortable bed and I could be on my own again. It doesnt seem as homey here as it used to be. It just feels like the past and I have moved on so thats why it kind of feels weird here. I love my mom, my grandparents and my cousin, but we dont have to see each other every freakin day. lol. Well I'm glad I'm going back earlier than I thought and it was nice hanging out with my old friends. If I had a car I'd go to Orlando or Gainesville to visit them. Oh well. Maybe they can visit me. HA!!! Yeah right."

"event","Fue al Miami a veo Brokeback Mountain en Miami miercoles noche. Or whatever. It taught me that I dont want to be white, I dont want to have a sucky life, Jack is a slut, dont have a double life and camping in the woods or the mountain looks like fun. After the movie, we walked down Lincol road and sat on the beach. Yeah, it was cold as heck. We started  walking back and stopped at one of the only restaurants open 2 something in the morning and had pizza. It was really good, they were all specialty pizzas with cool toppings. Yesterday, I went to the mall with my mom and went to my grandparents house for a bit. When we got home I took the car and went to the mall to get a little something for Steve and Gio because I saw something that Gio would really like so I figured I'd have to get Steve something. I wanted it to be thoughtful. I like thoughtful gifts, not, ""Oh it's Christmas so I have to buy you a gift because that's what you do around this time of year"" gift. So I got their junk and I went to Gio's to give him his gift. Then I went home and waited till Steve and everyone else to arrive to go do whatever, we never plan anything. Okay, skipping over to the part where we actually did something, we went to Ihop and I got hot chocolate because IHOP makes fantastic hot chocolate. Then I had a milkshake. Then we went to the beach and played frisbee and junk and it was fun. UNtil we started talking. I knew it was going to be trouble, but they wanted to play, so I played. Anyways, Gio and Steven are being themselves and I cant deal with it anymore. Gio is mad at me for some reason and Steven, I dont know. He left his gift here so I guess he really doesnt care so I'm gonna go return it. Enough about that. I just wanted to end this with saying I really really dont like my brother. I am trying to avoid saying hate, but it's really hard right now. I hope he gets everything taken away from him for christmas and given to me, because that was grimy and I hate him. Opps, oh well. It came out."

"event","Okay, I'm really fucking upset. I waited too damn long to get the gosh darn superman ring. I kind of didnt want to order it online because I wanted to see it and try it on in person. I called every Hot Topic in Tampa, Ft. Lauderdale and Miami and it was only at ONE store at Aventura Mall. I called them to ask what sizes they have so I did waste time and gas going all the way over there. THey only had size ten left and of course that's way too big for me. So I'm like, whatever, I'll order it online. I go to the website and they only have size ten and eleven left. WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Damnit! I could have ordered it the day I saw it with my size and everything/ . I'm so damn upset. And it's only twelve dollars!!!!!!!!! Fuck. I hate cursing. I've wanted that ring since the seventh grade when I first saw it. Many of you dont know this, but that used to be my symbol. I had a superman charm from like sixth grade to ninth grade when I lost it. THis is why I hate waiting and I get things as soon as I see something, especially if it's a good deal and in limited supply. Hold on to your love and never let it go. Be aggressive and dont be afraid to show your feelings for them. Let them know how you feel because they may feel the same way about you. Dont distance yourself from them, dont be afraid to be close. Man, that ring was so close! I could feel it in may hands. Damn damn damn. At least I saved twelve bucks??????????/ uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

"event","Does anyone have any weed? Or any other kind of narcotic substance that I could be under the influence of? I need to get some things off my mind and escape. It's not all that bad, at least right now. I do enjoy being high on life though and not having to need any other outside forces to solve my problems, but sometimes I feel like I need an outside influence to get some stuff of my mind, clear my head and escape for a while. I dont think I'd ever allow myself to do it, I just like talking about it because I wonder what if I stoop to that level. Hmmmmm.................."

"event","My feet are numb. I walked over five miles. Walked through this weird neighborhood between 50th and 56th St. Walked across the street to McDonalds and bought a double cheeseburger and strawberry milkshake. Then I walked back home. It took two hours, I was kind of disappointed, I want to be away for more than that. I dont want to be here alone. It feels so weird and lonely here being by myself and there is so much going on. I'm gonna lie down and listen to the silent hum of my computer and the fridge gargling. Goodnight."

"event","Journals are good for organizing your thoughts and helping you think about certain ideas. Writing them down on a peice of paper may help to get all the confusion out of your head and get them on solid paper. Livejournal is healing in that way too, but also in another way. It's more public then writing in a private journal so it helps you talk to people without talking to them directly which can help if you cant say something in words or get yourself to talk to someone in person. So why did I just post a private entry? Maybe it's because I don't want people to worry and it's more of a personal problem that cannot really be helped and I dont want people to feel sorry that they can't help, not that they would anyways. Does anyone else post private entries? And for what reason?"

"event",".............Aeon Flux- Good movie. Go see it, just don't get lost. It could seem complicated but it will clear up. This week went by fast and I hope the next two weeks go by fast too, so much stuff to do and I'm not ready to do it. Can I just skip a couple years until I'm out of college? That would be awesome. School sux, life is hard, I have too much personal issues that distract me more than anything. What's on the bright side? There is no brightside. Only darkness. Like the darkside of the moon. Someone shine a light on me. (Ooooo, that was good)"

"event","Paper due Monday, Portfolio due Monday, test on Tues., 2 tests on Wednesday, Paper due next Fri. And what am I doing? Writing this entry and thinking about going to see Aeon Flux tonight and Sam's party. And I'm sooooooo excited about going to see Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I go to the website like everyday. So many good movies are coming out next week, including that and Memoirs of a Geisha and Brokeback Mountain. Memoirs of a Geisha is a book, I've never read it but the previews look really good. I like cultural historical movies like that; like Tha Last Samauri and The Last Emperor and Mulan. lol. A couple weeks ago I found out that Brokeback Mountain was a short story that was published in the New Yorker a couple years ago so I read that and now I'm even more excited to see that movie too. The previews look pretty accurate to the story. There's some good actors in it and it's directed by Ang Lee so it should be a good movie. Here is a list of movies that are coming out that I want to see:

Already saw ReNt so............
Movies to see:
Aeon Flux
Walk the Line
Yours, Mine and Ours
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the      
      Witch and the Wardrobe
Brokeback Mountain
Memoirs of a Geisha
King Kong
Syriana
Munich
The Producers
Superman (summer 2006)

"event","I think I need egg nog. I can't live without it. One of the main things I look foward to to the holiday season is egg nog and pumpkin pie. They should sell them year round. Egg nog. Damnit, Egg nog! It's always on my mind. I can't stop thinking about it. I wonder if I'll dream about it tonight. Wow, what if all the raindrops werent candy drops and gum drops, what if it was egg nog? OOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh my gosh. Oh my gosh, egg nog rain. Oh my gosh. Rivers of egg nog. oh my god, it's so hard to write right now. Mountains would be covered in Egg nog ice cream. I can't wait to go home and buy Egg nog Ice Cream. Could one live on just Egg nog? Am I the only one who likes egg nog that much? Because a lot of people don't like it. They're just bloomin crazy, I dont understand them. They have no idea, I feel sorry for them and I hate them a little bit. I do, I hate them. I think egg nog needs a little more appreciation. If it were running for president, I would so vote for it. Who is reading this crazy shit anyways. It's so embarassing for people to read about how much I'm crazy in love with egg nog but I dont care. I'm not ashamed I'll shout it to the whole world on the highest mountain top that I am in love with egg nog. What if egg nog was a person! I'm afraid of how I'd react so I'm not even gonna think about that.uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i love egg nog. Right now I am ignoring all my i.m.'s to express my love for egg nog. Oh my gosh I'm sinning. This is glutny! You can't love food this much. Omg, lord forgive me. Egg nog, I thik we're gonna have to take a break. It can't go on like this. You're breaking my heart because I can't love you this much but I do and it's wrong. I'm sorry, it's not you, it's me. I hope you still see me as the same old Shawn. Eileen, come get this egg nog out of my fridge, it hurts my body to know that it's in there, waiting to be consumed. I'm so sorry. Will you forgive me? I need a therapist. Now I'm thinking of being in a museum with works of art with egg nog in them. Okay, I have to focus on something else right now. Hello light. How are you? You're so bright tonight. I appreciate how you're always there whenver I need to see something in the dark. Thanks. I love light. Okay, I'm gonna try and go to bed and keep my focus on the wonderful light of life. egg nog"

"event","<P>CODY'S BACK, THAT'S WHO! I missed you all so much. No joke. I really did. My new computer really.. sucks. It's so fucking slow. I waited 15 minutes for this page to load. I am sorry, but I won't be able to comment as much as I used to anymore. I have been so busy! I have to go to work now, but I will update / comment on everyone's LJs when I get back.. around five. Love you all, hope you guys had a great Christmas! &lt;3</P>

"event","<P>Well, sence I was away from LJ all summer long, let me fill you in on a few&nbsp;things.</P>
<UL>
<LI>I did something stupid to Rob which I will never forgive myself for.</LI>
<LI>Woke up in a hospital bed&nbsp;three times.</LI>
<LI>Got sent to the MI for two weeks.</LI>
<LI>Tried to be friends with my dad again, but he shunned me off because of my sexuality.</LI>
<LI>Melissa almost burned the house down because she left a candle lit.</LI>
<LI>Broke my arm because I jumped off my roof into the pool (not such a smart idea).</LI>
<LI>Got burned at Ozzfest.</LI>
<LI>Most of the bands at Ozzfest sucked, anyway.</LI>
<LI>Found out that somehow I am related to Matt Damon. (second cousin once removed or some shit like that? I don't know.)</LI></UL>
<P>And that's about it. Not much of an entry, but I post a lot because I have no life.</P>"

"event","<P>Cody's back, that's who's back! My old account was <lj user=""codyisking"" /> . I took a nice big mental vacation. Life's been going normally. Melissa still tries to poison me, dad's a jerk who doesn't pay child support, mom's never home, me and Ryan are still in love, me and Roberta are still best friends, I got my first CAR.. A ELANTRA! See, look how sexy it is!</P>

<P>Now at least I can drive where I want instead of walking all the frickin time. Look at that hot negro. Damn. Doing okay in school, I guess. 96.374 average... kind of dissapointed, because I know I can do&nbsp;better than that. Oh well, A+ and above is good, I guess. I start my new job at CVS soon. I am excited! I hope that some of you guys still remeber me in the communities ::crosses fingers:: Well, hope all is well with everyone, g'night.</P>"

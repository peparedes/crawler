<b>Celestial Music</b>
by Louise Gluck

<i>I have a friend who still believes in heaven.
Not a stupid person, yet with all she knows, she literally talks to God.
She thinks someone listens in heaven.
On earth she's unusually competent.
Brave too, able to face unpleasantness.

We found a caterpillar dying in the dirt, greedy ants crawling over it.
I'm always moved by disaster, always eager to oppose vitality
But timid also, quick to shut my eyes.
Whereas my friend was able to watch, to let events play out
According to nature. For my sake she intervened
Brushing a few ants off the torn thing, and set it down
Across the road.

My friend says I shut my eyes to God, that nothing else explains
My aversion to reality. She says I'm like the child who
Buries her head in the pillow
So as not to see, the child who tells herself
That light causes sadness-
My friend is like the mother. Patient, urging me
To wake up an adult like herself, a courageous person-

In my dreams, my friend reproaches me. We're walking
On the same road, except it's winter now;
She's telling me that when you love the world you hear celestial music:
Look up, she says. When I look up, nothing.
Only clouds, snow, a white business in the trees
Like brides leaping to a great height-
Then I'm afraid for her; I see her
Caught in a net deliberately cast over the earth-

In reality, we sit by the side of the road, watching the sun set;
From time to time, the silence pierced by a birdcall.
It's this moment we're trying to explain, the fact
That we're at ease with death, with solitude.
My friend draws a circle in the dirt; inside, the caterpillar doesn't move.
She's always trying to make something whole, something beautiful, an image
Capable of life apart from her.
We're very quiet. It's peaceful sitting here, not speaking, The composition
Fixed, the road turning suddenly dark, the air
Going cool, here and there the rocks shining and glittering-
It's this stillness we both love.
The love of form is a love of endings.</i>


The suggestion in the first three stanzas really struck me. I'm not sure I've grokked the last two stanzas yet, but I want to come back and look at it again."

"event","A few weeks ago my parents sent me a postcard from the Grand Canyon, which I stuck in my bulletin board. Today, I was studying, which involves a lot of staring at the wall, so I looked more closely at it and noticed the handwriting for the first time. My conclusion is that Dad wrote the following:<br /><br /><em>Dear Amanda: We watched the sunset from this spot. Today we hike 6 miles round trip and over 2000' down into the Canyon. A little out of shape, but we did it. love, Dad</em><br /><br />Mom addressed the card and wrote in the date. She also edited the message:<br /><em><br />sun<strike>set</strike>(rise)(6:00AM)</em><br /><br />(The parts in parentheses were squeezed between lines with a proofreading insert mark.)<br /><br />I'm giggling imagining their postcard-writing session: Dad writes messages with slightly-inaccurate stories, Mom does the addresses, dates, fact-checking, and commentary. Also note that while she fixed <em>sunset</em> she didn't fix Dad's tense error. (Judging from context, <em>hike</em> ought to have been <em>hiked</em>.)<br /><br />I love my parents.<br /><br />UPDATE: OK, this is even funnier than I thought. I just IM'd Ellen to tell her to read this post, and she got out her postcard to compare. Hers is also written by Dad and dated/addressed by Mom, but Dad wrote <em>sunrise (6:00AM)</em>. He must have done hers after mine.<br /><br />And the best part: Ellen also remarked that it was cute of Dad to write <em>dear</em> and <em>love</em>, which is not his usual style. So I looked back at mine, and Mom totally added in the <em>love</em>. Dad just signed it. He did write the <em>dear</em>, however."

"event","People at work have started greeting me with ""Hey there short-timer!"" I'm not amused, but it is true. This is my last week at work. I was hoping to get a fair amount done, but there's so much administrative stuff that goes along with resignation that I might not make my goals. My parents are coming on Friday to pick up the bedroom furniture they've been kindly lending me for the past two years. (Meaning I have to get all my clothes out of it before then.) Tim and I are having a going-away party on Saturday, my sisters are coming on Sunday, and we're taking off on a sisters beach vacation next Monday-Friday. (Sisters, I've already packed my beach shovels and buckets that Mom got us for Easter!) Then back to DC to finish packing up the last few things, load up the truck on Saturday, and drive to St. Louis on Sunday.

It's getting close! I'm really excited.

I'm supposed to fill out a form for Wash U's student directory. I have to write about my ""special interests, talents, hobbies and unusual characteristics,"" what I see myself doing 20 years from now, and what specialty I'd pick if I had to choose now. Also, describe myself in one word. I thought once I got into med school those questions would be done with! What should I write? 

(I'm looking at the LJ mood options, hoping for one-word descriptors. Chipper? Giggly? Nerdy? Indescribable? (ha!) Recumbent? Actually, I think ""lucky"" might be it.)"

One of my internet acquaintances is currently applying to med schools and experiencing some paperwork difficulties with Wash U. (She has to get her degrees certified, and she has 3 degrees from 3 schools, one of which is being nonresponsive.) This was part of my response to her:


They've been pretty laid-back about paperwork and stuff. I've had a lot of phone conversations with them:

(spring 05)
Me: I've been thinking about deferring. What's the deadline?
Secretary: June 15, but let me transfer you to the dean.
Dean: [fatherly lecture on how they allow deferrals but if I'm sure about medicine I should start right away] Anything else I can help with?

(late June)
Me: Um, hi. I lost my parking paperwork. Can you tell me how much a parking pass costs?
Parking person: Oh, you don't have to pay NOW! Don't worry about it! It's $15 though.

(two days ago)
Me: Um, hi. I know my medical paperwork was supposed to be in last week, but my physician left his practice and I haven't had a physical in over a year. Can I get a physical once I move to St. Louis?
Health services person: Sure, no problem! Just send in what you have, and call this number to make an appointment.

So I'd say if you have trouble, call them up and they'll be helpful.

Also, if I ever call you up and start with ""Um, hi"" you know I'm about to admit to having done something flakey."

I've had the following conversation several times recently:

Q: So - engineering to med school. Big leap! What made you decide to do it? 
A: Well, I liked being a computer engineering student, but once I did
a couple of co-ops, I realized that I hated it and had to do something
else.
Q: So have you gotten a bunch of medical experience?
A: Well, not as much as I would've liked. I volunteer at the hospital but it's just candy-striping. 
Q: So how do you know that you're going to like medicine once you really do it?
A: Um, I don't know. [Oh crap! I really don't! What if I hate it? What
if I suck?]

I'm not extremely scared of school; I'm pretty good at academics so I should be able to do that. But I keep second-guessing my choice. Do I really know that medicine is the career for me? Looking for information about residencies today, I ran across <a href=""http://forums.studentdoctor.net/showthread.php?t=195799"">this thread</a> in which a bunch of students and residents say they wouldn't do it over again if they could. That's pretty scary. A lot of them say that in order to get through, you have to really really want it. Do I ""really really want it""? I don't know. I mean, I've gotten this far, but stubbornness is pretty powerful. I'm not one of those people who have always wanted to be a doctor, and in general I don't think I'm the super-dedicated type.

On the other hand, I read several blogs by people like <a href=""http://theunderweardrawer.blogspot.com/"">Michelle</a> who's a resident and seems happy and has a life. And she seems cool, like someone I'd want to be friends with. I don't know the random people from the link above; maybe they're whiners all the time.

I'm pretty sure I will like it, and there are so many career paths in medicine - I could do research or even (gag) be an administrator if I wanted a more 8-5 type lifestyle. It's not as though I'm going to be locked into general surgery or something that I wouldn't like. And, too, this is really the only career path that I have been excited about pursuing. I can't think of anything else I'd want to do. I could keep doing what I do now, but I don't think that the cushy government job is really something to aspire to. Honestly, I feel like I'm wasting my talents here; I should be trying to reach my potential.

So in general I try to think positive and surround myself with stuff that excites me rather than complaints that scare me, but I worry that really what I'm doing is sticking my head in the sand."

"event","I think I want to start using my LJ as an actual journal. Two reasons: I have a lot of things that I'm thinking about, and I think writing them down might clarify my thinking. Also, I think this might be a more fun way to read back and see what I was doing than paging through old emails. Now that I announced this plan, I have to actually do it!"

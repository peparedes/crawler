I hate Tony Lovato with a mear passion. Don't like it I dont GIVE A FUCK. Learn some real music search in your little winamp player for someone who can accually write a good song. Someone that probably doesn't have an STD by now. Yes Tony, amazing at writing songs lets swoon over how many times he can rhyme Night with tonight. JESUS that took some talent. Yes, tony, girls are only good for pussy tits and making food, how about saying that alittle louder? Yes that took courage shows you are a real tough man that can't be beat.

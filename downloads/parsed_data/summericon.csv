Meaning I missed FOB, and Madison.

Take some classes at TC for Administrative Assistant I think.  Be someone's personal secretary or something.  

Going to Madison for 5 days.  Leave next Wednesday for Milwaukee to see Fall Out Boy at the Rave, then off to Madison until Sunday.  Can't wait to get away.

Things are kind of off right now.  Brandon's gone for 9 days, Cammie's got a new man, Josh and I aren't speaking.  Maybe I'll give Justin a call this weekend.  

Someone called me at 3am last night.  Someone I haven't talked to in months.  I really nervous as to why, but they left no message.  I don't know why these people have been calling me lately.  Had another strange phone call a few weeks ago as well that I didn't answer and no message was left. 

I really just want to focus on Madison and how much fun I have with my friends there.  

Nicole and Mary Beth are coming home this weekend too.

No forget isn't the right word.  I just push it all to the back of mind as to not have to think about how lost I feel without them.  

I'm actually at work right now.  Have rooms to clean but no patience to do it.

Hung out with Mary Beth the other day when she came home.  I miss CCQ.  Which stands for Chili Con Queso and I just found that out.  Sad.

I find out about the apprenticeship soon.  I'm nervous.  I want it, but I know it'll change everything.  I don't think I'm not ready for more change.

I can't stop thinking about this summer.  It's so far away, but I feel as though it's coming.  Who's coming home, and who's staying?  Will everything be the same?  Will we all still be friends?  Or at least fake friends?

I pierced my nose again.  There's a hoop right next to my stud.  Cute I think.  Maybe a little too ghetto for me.

"event","Friday night.
       Cammie and I stopped at Becker's to cheer him up.  Went to Brandon Dean's and hung out there for awhile.  Headed over to some Norbert party that was over, so Cammie and I snuck away and went to her friend Tim's.  Chilled there for awhile and drank.  Watched the boys build a ginormous beer can pyramid.  And then watched it fall.

Saturday night.
      Cammie met some boys while she was getting gas and got us invited to a kegger out by Denmark.  Hung out there for a few hours, met some really nice guys.  Went to a three barrell in Suamico with a live band after that.  Saw some people from work.  Got really drunk and almost thrown in a pond twice.  Fell in a bathtub.  Had too much fun.

Sunday.
     Went swimming somewhere in Kewaunee with Cammie, Jake, Adam, and some other creepy kid.  Went and saw the Exorcism of Emily Rose with Cammie, Holiday, Aaron and Brandon.  Went over to Nick's apartment and watched him get VERY drunk.  Take off his clothes, tie a rope to ""himself"" and the refrigerator.  And proceed to close it.  Ouch.  Have Nick smash a piece of plastic over his head to see if it would break.  It didn't.  Let people shoot him multiple times with a dart gun.  Fucking crazy ass kid.  

Monday.
     Interview for the apprenticeship today.  And I missed it.  Some asshole on 441 decided to run me off the road.  I spun out and ended up in the ditch.  Thankfully a really cute boy pulled over and helped me while the asshole took off.  Needed 4 new tires and an alignment.  The fucking wire was coming out of them.  So I have to call back and reschedule that."

That one lame comment.  The previous one from your friend.  Boiled over.

I don't really understand why this hurts me.  It was you that was supposed to be hurt.  And I really think you could care less.

I need lessons on how to mess with boys brains.

Because this completely backfired on me.  Somehow, you came out ahead.  You won.  And I can not for the life of me figure out how this happened, where it all went wrong.

I let you get to me.  I put too much effort into it, and you spotted that.  The numerous work visits, and texts.  All too much.  

I'll be more subtle next time.





Went dancing with Cammie last night.  Had a soooo much fun.  Almost watched her slap Keenan (for the second time).  It wasn't the best fun, but somehow, it was great.  

Tonight is possibly an Oshkosh visit to Cammie's cousin.  Not sure I'm looking forward to it after all that went down with the asshole last night.  Not sure I'm really looking forward to anything besides getting trashed.  And trying to forget.

Where to start.  Extended Stay Settle Inn.

A woman and her husband and three kids have a room.  The husband's sister has her own.  Last night the woman went out while the siseter watched her kids.  The husband stayed in as well.  She gets back and is drunk, and can't get into her room because he has the deadbold on.  So she just sleeps in his sister's room.  

She still can't get into the room this morning so Dan (maintenance) and Ann go get the door open somehow.  They find him on the floor.  Blue.  With a needle lying next to him.  He o.d'd.  Dan ran and yelled for Angie to call an ambulance, and I was coming down the stairs then.  

I thought I was going to be sick.  I stood there and watched the police tell the wife and sister that he was dead.  Watched them tell the kids.  I can't imagine anything more horrible.

Then, I found out that I was the last person to clean that room (Thursday) so the police had to question me as to whether I saw any drugs or needles in the room.  I hadn't.

Wow.

Good news though.  Last night was fun. 

Party at Koa's, then went to Alan's, then two of Cammie's friends, and back to Alan's.  Got pretty drunk.

::I was drunk and having a great time while that man was dying::

Tonight is a party at Dan's and another at Alan's.
I'm sleeping at Cammie's."

I don't know if it's possible but the color of my hair makes me feel different.  When it's blonde I feel like it's okay for me to be ditzy.  And when it's dark, it's okay for me to be a bitch.
And right now, I just feel like I'm done being fucked with.

I know it's not really true.  But it's one of the most difficult feeling I've had.

I know I can visit, but it's not the same as being able to call up the girls for a random movie night.  

I feel like my friends are really all I have.

I'm going to have to get used to going to work and not seeing Ashley.  Or calling up Mary Beth to go to Kavarna.  Or head over to Nicole's at 7:00 to start drinking.

The part that's even harder for me is knowing that most of them won't be back next summer.  Ashley and Caitlyn will probably stay at their apartment in Madison.  Mary Beth and Nicole aren't sure yet, but they might stay too.  The only people coming back are Lisa, April, and Katie.  

I feel like I have nothing to look forward to.

Ate at Applebee's, and went back to Mary Beth's and stole her sweats and layed around and talked and watched Sex Talk with Sue or whatever it's called.

It ended up being a pretty good weekend.  And I only have my friends to thank for that.

Party at Koa's.  It was supposed to be only a few people until Brandon called Nicole.  We ended up with a keg.  And the 10 people he was bringing turned into 30.  The basement was filled, and Billy got pissed.  So I told everyone that no one else was allowed to come and if they had invited more people to call them and tell them to turn around because they could not come into the house.

Fun thing was that I got to kick someone out after they called me a bitch.  It was great.  Billy was right behind me.  
 
People from my high school were there.  My friend Cammie, and this guy Jason who hated me, but was all nice when he found out it was my best friend's house.  Ass.

Saturday was kind of lame.  Had a another keg party to go to, but it ended up being Cammie's ex-boyfriend's house, and he wouldn't let her in so we picked up some boys on Maine Street and hung out with them instead.

Last night a few of us watched EuroTrip at Catilyn's.  It was nice.  No drama.  Oddly enough."

I don't know what it is about that show.  It's so innocent.  It's not like the O.C, or Sex and the City.  It's like the characters remain untouched by the media.  They're not pushed into drinking, drugs, or sex.

"event","The voices inside my head are arguing again.
They are so softly spoken but I know their there. They're telling me not to care. I never have before. They're telling me that ive become a softy for people. That ive let all those walls I built up at a young age tumble.

But they are wrong.

Im stronger then I was then and im not going to get hurt. Ive been stabbed in the back so much that I expect it.
Im not going to let it control me now. Im going to let it make me stronger. Because now they think that ill let them back into my life like it all never happened.

But they are wrong."

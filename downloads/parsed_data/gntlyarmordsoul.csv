I'm sorry to keep you here in Rukongai, but I really appreciate the company.  Would it be okay if I come over and meet the rest of your party?

"event","It's been slow at the inn lately.  I guess I shouldn't complain, when things get interesting for us, they get a little too interesting!  I did get to meet Sora and Riku.  It was nice to find more of the people stuck here with us.

I hope you both are doing okay!  You can come back and visit us anytime!

We've been in Zanarkand for a while now.  Well, I have at least.  It seems strange to stay in one place for so long, after all the traveling Brother and I used to do.  But it's a nice strange.  I don't know if we can, and I do feel like we should be going somewhere some days and it makes me anxious to leave.  But if we had to stay somewhere, this would be a nice play to stay.

<lj-cut text=""Private"">
<b>[Private]</b>
Sora and Riku seem to know a lot more about this place than anyone else that's here so far.  I wonder what that means, in the long road.  I hope their 'door' isn't the same 'gate' Brother thinks it is.  I still can't get him to tell me about him dying, but since he's not now, I don't want him to die again!  I know he thinks he needs to portect me, but obviously it's the other way around!

"event","Not much has been happening here.  Brother and I were supposed to go outside to meet someone, but I guess we're not going to since he came here.  I'm kind of dissapointed; I wanted to see what it was like outside Zanarkand.  But I guess there will be time for that later.  I hope we can still meet his friend now that he's here.

Mostly these days I've been going through this book we won for our hunt.  There doesn't seem to ba anything new, so I don't get how it's supposed to help us.  Brother and I are more advanced that this stuff!"

"event","Wha...what happened!?  Brother is a mouse!  I almost stepped on him this morning!  I'll have to be more careful, I don't know who else is is around here.

Does anyone know how to fix this?  I don't think he much likes being a mouse.  But I don't know what to do besides keep people from stepping on him!"

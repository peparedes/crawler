"event","Breathing deeply,walking backwards
finding strength to call and ask her
rollercoaster,favorite ride
let me kiss u one last time

leave me standing here
act like im not around
the coast'll probably never clear
can i please go home now
i had a dream about u again
where i wait outside until u let me in
and there i stay

lay beside me and listen out the wall
we'll keep on lying until the summer comes
i had that dream about u again
where u drive my car right off the fucking cliff

and now i'm breathing deeply,walking backwards
finding strength to call and ask her
rollercoaster,favorite ride
let me kiss u one last time

make me a promise that i will never tell
all i remember's the way your bedroom smells
i had that dream about u again
where i wait outside until you let me in

and now im breathing deeply, walking backwards
finding strength to call and ask her
rollercoaster, favorite ride
let me kiss u one last time good night

Good Night"

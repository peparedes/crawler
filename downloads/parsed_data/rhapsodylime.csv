(No I'm not suicidal, I'm just talking about a friendship.) Love you, please forgive me.</strong>"

Illuminatus05: Frank is dead Ashleigh. And if not now, he will be. The Airforce is killing the man you loved. He doesn't exist anymore. Soon he will be an order-taking drone. 
CntryPrincess16: no he won't
Illuminatus05: Yes, he will. Nobody survives what they put you through. Not even somebody as strong-willed as Frank. 
Illuminatus05: The atmosphere makes it impossible 
CntryPrincess16: he won't turn into that!
Illuminatus05: It's torture. 
Illuminatus05: He'll be beaten into a shell. 
Illuminatus05: Hammered. 
CntryPrincess16: i won't let him!
Illuminatus05: He will no longer be the one you loved Ashleigh. You have to let him go. 
CntryPrincess16: NO!
CntryPrincess16: SCREW YOU!
Illuminatus05: Ashleigh. I'm trying to help. 
CntryPrincess16: NO!
CntryPrincess16: YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ME TO NOW LOVE HIM!
CntryPrincess16: SCREW YOU TO HELL!
Illuminatus05: Uh. He's a drone. Who would love that? 
Illuminatus05: He's not the one you cared for. 
CntryPrincess16: He's not!
CntryPrincess16: He never will be!
CntryPrincess16: I won't let him!
Illuminatus05: Yes Ashleigh. He's gone. 
CntryPrincess16: NO!
Illuminatus05: Let him go. 
Illuminatus05: You deserve better than this 
CntryPrincess16: you stay the hell away from him
Illuminatus05: Clearly 
CntryPrincess16: me*
Illuminatus05: Interesting. 
CntryPrincess16: i don't want to talk to you anymore
CntryPrincess16: he won't turn into that
CntryPrincess16: he won't
Illuminatus05: This is not a rose-colored world. The Military kills good men. Sometimes it turns them into better men. But in reality, many of them become statistics. 
Illuminatus05: Harsh reality Ashleigh. 
Illuminatus05: You need to let him go. 
Illuminatus05: You deserve better than all those damn tears you've shed for him. 
CntryPrincess16: you need to shut the hell up
Illuminatus05: I need to keep talking and slap you as hard as my words will let me. 
CntryPrincess16: just because you're aloen doesn't mean everyone else has to be!
Illuminatus05: I'm trying to get you un-hung up on this guy so you don't have to be alone. 
Illuminatus05: You're misinterpreting my intent. 
CntryPrincess16: I'm not going to be alone
CntryPrincess16: he's going to come back to me
Illuminatus05: No you most certainly will not, provided you can let him go. 
Illuminatus05: He's never coming back to you, Ashleigh. 
CntryPrincess16: yes he is!
Illuminatus05: No Ashleigh. He's never coming back. 
CntryPrincess16: yes@
CntryPrincess16: he is@!
Illuminatus05: You're in denial. 
CntryPrincess16: he's coming back for thanksgiving 
Illuminatus05: If he comes back it's for his family, not you. 
CntryPrincess16: and christmas
Illuminatus05: You can hate me as much as you want. I'm right. 
CntryPrincess16: no you're not!
Illuminatus05: You deserve better. 
CntryPrincess16: and you deserve to die
Illuminatus05: Point taken. Yes. But you deserve more than persisting pain. 
Illuminatus05: Which, last I checked, is all he seems to be causing you. 
CntryPrincess16: he loves me!
CntryPrincess16: he does!
Illuminatus05: Love is supposed to make people happy. Not this. 
CntryPrincess16: Love is about sticking through it all!
Illuminatus05: Use your logic to analyze this. He doesn't love you Ashleigh. 
CntryPrincess16: The happy and the hurt!
Illuminatus05: If he did, he wouldn't let you suffer like this. 
CntryPrincess16: But you wouldn't know that because you've never been in love!
Illuminatus05: Perhaps not, but I can figure out what love ISN'T. 
CntryPrincess16: Not you can't!
CntryPrincess16: He will come back to me
CntryPrincess16: he loves me
Illuminatus05: If I was a girl I'd slap you now, grab you by the sides of your face, look right into your eyes, and scream at you. He's not coming back for you. 
Illuminatus05: He does not love you. 
CntryPrincess16: YES HE DOES!
Illuminatus05: And if he did, he'd want you to be happy and get over him. 
CntryPrincess16: YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT LOVE BECAUSE WHO WOULD LOVE YOU?!
Illuminatus05: Certainly not myself. 
CntryPrincess16: THEN SHUT UP!
CntryPrincess16: He loves me!
CntryPrincess16: He will come back!
Illuminatus05: You're behaving like a child. 
CntryPrincess16: And you're an asshole!
Illuminatus05: I'm an asshole who is trying to slap you back to reality. 
CntryPrincess16: I am in reality!
Illuminatus05: To realize there are more fish than Frank. 
CntryPrincess16: I love Frank!
CntryPrincess16: and he loves me!
Illuminatus05: But it's not mutual love Ashleigh and you know that. 
Illuminatus05: On some level you do. 
CntryPrincess16: SCREW YOU!
CntryPrincess16: NO I DON'T!
CntryPrincess16: HE LOVES ME!
Illuminatus05: He does not. 
CntryPrincess16: YOU DON'T KNOW HIM WELL ENOUGH THEN!
CntryPrincess16: You didn't see his eyes when he looked into mine!
Illuminatus05: I've known him for 4 years. 
Illuminatus05: Perhaps I don't know him as well as I'd like to. 
CntryPrincess16: You don't know!
Illuminatus05: But I know people. People who love people don't let people suffer needlessly. 
CntryPrincess16: I'm not suffereing!
Illuminatus05: Yes. You are. The tears you've cried, the countless nights you've screamed how you hate yourself and you want to die 
Illuminatus05: You deserve to die 
Illuminatus05: Those 
Illuminatus05: That's suffering. 
Illuminatus05: Needless suffering. 
CntryPrincess16: No it's not!
CntryPrincess16: HE WILL COME BACK!
Illuminatus05: He will come back. But not for you. 
CntryPrincess16: HE WILL COME BACK FOR ME!
Illuminatus05: He'll make time for you, I don't doubt it. But you're not his priority. 
Illuminatus05: Frank is in the military now. People are devices to him. 
Illuminatus05: He ranks them according to importance 
CntryPrincess16: I don't need to be his priority!
Illuminatus05: Care to guess where you lie? 
CntryPrincess16: I want him to live his dream!
CntryPrincess16: He cried billy!
CntryPrincess16: FRANK CRIED WHEN WE BROKE UP!
CntryPrincess16: FRANK!
CntryPrincess16: The guy with no tear ducts!
CntryPrincess16: CRIED!
Illuminatus05: You're going to make me say something which is defeating my point. 
CntryPrincess16: SAY IT!
Illuminatus05: Of course he loves you on some level. I said those things about him not loving you in an effort to harden your heart. In reality he loves you enough that he wants you to move on. 
CntryPrincess16: No he doesn't
Illuminatus05: Because no, he doesn't want you to suffer anymore. 
CntryPrincess16: he wants me to wait for him
Illuminatus05: No, he doesn't. 
Illuminatus05: And that is reality. 
CntryPrincess16: deep down he does but he won't admit it
Illuminatus05: Deep down he knows you're too good for him 
Illuminatus05: And that he'll never 
Illuminatus05: EVER 
Illuminatus05: be able to give you what you deserve 
Illuminatus05: because yes 
CntryPrincess16: YES HE WILL!
Illuminatus05: his career is his life 
CntryPrincess16: Just loving him is what I deserve!
Illuminatus05: You deserve someone who can love you back. 
Illuminatus05: He CAN'T. 
CntryPrincess16: HE DOES LOVE ME BACK!
Illuminatus05: Not the way you need 
Illuminatus05: He can only love you enough to push you away so he can't hurt you 
Illuminatus05: But he is anyway. 
Illuminatus05: His whole point is defeated. 
CntryPrincess16 wants to directly connect. 
Illuminatus05 is now directly connected. 
CntryPrincess16: 
CntryPrincess16: CAN YOU HONESTLY LOOK AT THAT PICTURE AND SAY WE'RE NOT IN LOVE?!
Illuminatus05: Am I supposed to look at this image and see chemistry? I couldn't possibly. After all, I've never ""been in love"" 
CntryPrincess16: Screw you
Illuminatus05: Yes. I can. 
CntryPrincess16: stay the hell away from me
Illuminatus05: I'm only repeating your words. 
Illuminatus05: I see a pose, done specifically for a picture.\ 
CntryPrincess16: i don't want to talk to you...ever again
Illuminatus05: When you see the reason in my words, you will understand I tried to help. 
CntryPrincess16: i will never see the reason of your words
CntryPrincess16: except that you are a lonely asshole who wants to hurt everyone else!
CntryPrincess16: I HATE YOU!
Illuminatus05: Very well. That's horribly unfortunate. 
Illuminatus05: Please take care. 
Illuminatus05: Be safe. 
CntryPrincess16: you've hurt me more than he ever has
Illuminatus05: And always do the right thing. 
Illuminatus05: Good Night. 


He was supposted to be one of my best friends....."

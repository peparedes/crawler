Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinkin'
That there was a little more to life somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die tryin'
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

O yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well it was kinda cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach
And for one desperate moment
There he crept back in her memory
God it's so painful when something that's so close
Is still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl"

No illusions as we take
Refuge in young man's pleasure
Breaking down the dreams we make
Real

One down one to go
Another town and one more show
Downtown they're giving away
But she never came back

No phone can take your place
You know what I mean
We have the same intrigue
As a court of kings

Ah leave it
Ah leave it
Two down there you go
McArthur Park in the driving snow
Uptown they're digging it out
Better lay your claim

Get home you're not alone
You just broke out of the danger zone
Be there to show your face
On another dreamy day

Ah leave it
Ah leave it

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven

Get the idea cross around the track
Underneath the flank of a thoroughbred racing chaser
Getting the feel as a river flows
Would you like to go n' shoot the mountain masses
And here you stand no taller than the grass sees
And should you really chase so hard
The truth of sport plays rings around you 

Going for the one
Going for the one 

Get in the way as the tons of water
Racing with you crashing thru the rudder
Once at the start can you gamble
That you really surely really mean to finish
After seeing all your sense of fear diminish
As you treat danger a pure collection
As you throw away misconceptions
Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for a listen in time
   taken so high
   to touch to move
   listen to life
   touching touch time
   travel twilight
   taken so high
Roundabout, sounding out, love you so
   love you so
   love you so 

Now the verses I've sang
Don't add much weight to the story in my head
So I'm thinking I should go and write a punch line
But they're so hard to find
In my cosmic mind
So I think I'll take a look out of the window
When I think about you
I don't feel low
N'should I really chase so hard
The truth of sport plays rings around you
Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for to listen in time
   taken so high
   to touch to move
   listen to life
   Touching touch time
   travel twilight
   taken so high
   taking your time
   turn on to love
   turnstile to one
   tender timing
   rocking rolling
   listen in time
   taken so high
   to touch to move
   listen to life
   touching touchtime

   taken so high

   turn on to love
   turnstile to one
   tender timing
   rocking rolling
   turn on to love
   turnstile to one
   tender timing
   rocking rolling

Moments decide
Moments delight
Moments in flight
Talk about sending love"

Where I'm no fun anymore
I am sorry
Sometimes it hurts so badly
I must cry out loud
I am lonely
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
And you make it hard

Remember what we've said and done and felt
about each other
Oh babe, have mercy
Don't let the past remind us of what we are not now
I am not dreaming.
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
And you make it hard-

Tearing yourself away from me now
You are free and I am crying
This does not mean I don't love you
I do, that's forever, yes and for always
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
And you make it hard

Something inside is telling me that
I've got your secret. Are you still listening?
Fear is the lock, and laughter the key to your heart
And I love you.

I am yours, you are mine, you are what you are
And you make it hard
And you make it hard

Friday evening, Sunday in the afternoon
What have you got to lose?
Tuesday mornin', please be gone I'm tired of you.
What have you got to lose?
Can I tell it like it is? Help me I'm sufferin'
Listen to me baby-Help me I'm dyin'
It's my heart that's a sufferin', it's a dyin'
That's what I have to lose
I've got an answer
I'm going to fly away
What have I got to lose?
Will you come see me
Thursdays and Saturdays?
What have you got to lose?

Chestnut brown canary
Ruby throated sparrow
Sing a song don't be long
Thrill me to the marrow
Voices of the angels ring around the moonlight
Asking me, said she so free
How can you catch the sparrow?
Lacy, lilting, lady, losing love, lamenting

Change my life, make it right
Be my lady.
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo

Cielo sol no tiene sangreahi,

No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life and you just got to play the game

So I take out my guitar and pass some time

And the jungle fire was burning
Down the track came a hobo hiking
And said ""boys, I'm not turning""
I'm headed for a land that's far away
Beside the crystal fountains
So come with me we'll go and see
The big rock candy mountains

In the big rock candy mountains
There's a land that's fair and bright
Where the handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night
Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
On the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees
The lemonade springs where the bluebird sings
In the big rock candy mountains

In the big rock candy mountains
All the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft boiled eggs
The farmers trees are full of fruit
And the barns are full of hay
Well I'm bound to go where there ain't no snow
Where the rain don't fall and the wind don't blow
In the big rock candy mountains....

In the big rock candy mountains
you never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol
Come a'tricklin' down the rocks
And the brakemen have to tip their hats
And the railroad bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew and of whiskey too
You can paddle all around 'em in a big canoe
In the big rock candy mountains

In the big rock candy mountains
The jails are made of tin
And you can walk right out again
As soon as you are in
There ain't no short handled shovels
No axes, saws, or picks
I'm gonna stay where you sleep all day
Where they hung the jerk that invented work
In the big rock candy mountains

I'll see you all this comin fall
In the big rock candy mountains...

When my belly starts a'rumblin
And I'm jonesin' for a treat
I close my eyes for a big surprise
The Tendercrisp Bacon Cheddar Ranch

I love the Tendercrisp Bacon Cheddar Ranch
The breasts that grow on trees
And streams of bacon ranch dressing
Flow right up to your knees
There's tumble weeds of bacon
And cheddar paves the streets
Folks don't front you 'cause you got the juice
Theres the trailer ladies comin' with a nice kaboose
Never get in any trouble never need an excuse
That's the Tendercrisp Bacon Cheddar Ranch

I love the Tendercrisp Bacon Cheddar Ranch
No one tells you to behave (behave!)
Your wildest fantasies come true
Dallas cheerleaders gives you shaves
Red onions make you laught instead
And French fries grow like weeds
You get the veg all day
All the lotto tickets paid
There's a king who wants you to have it your way
That's the Tendercrisp Bacon Cheddar Ranch

Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
But mama, you been on my mind.

I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down, don't get upset,
I am not pleading or saying that I can't forget
I do not walk the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Mama, you been on my mind.

Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts they might be narrow,
Where you been don't bother me nor bring me down in sorrow.
I don't even mind who you are wakin' with tomorrow,
But mama, you've been on my mind.

I am not askin' you to say words like ""yes"" or ""no""
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go
I'm just whispering to myself so I can pretend that I don't know
Mama, you just on my mind.

When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror.
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near.
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind

"event","Went to go see the Manson show at the Tabernacle last night and my god it was packed. I made my way up to the front row in the great sea of weirdos by the middle of the show.  I should have died last night. It was a really good show too.  Afterwards, Ryan and I went back to his place to get closer to god. We then departed for Wafflehouse and consumed to our digestive system's content. ""Shortly"" afterwards I left to see the dear and ceaselessly hospitable Caitlin to deliver her my Christmas ""ornament"" of which she is, I'm sure, SO delighted to own now and display on her tree.  But she'll never look at reindeer the same way again... :)
Once again, she let me play the bum and crash at her place until around 8 am like the merciful and benevolent benefactor she is :P  And I deeply apologize for leaving my nasty gum on the table like that...I totally forgot about it.
 
STORYTIME!
 
So I left Atlanta a little after 8 and stopped to get gas in Newnan.  I didn't bother looking at the price of the midgrade while I pulled in--I merely glanced at the sign on the road. I stared at the gallon counter while I pumped.  When I was finished it stopped at 8 and something gallons. I had paid by credit with no receipt at the pump itself. Before I got into my car I finally roused the curiosity to know how much exactly the gas cost.  
 
The pump said I just paid $1.50
 
I looked at the gallons and back at the price and back at the gallons and so on...
Then I looked at the price per gallon display and saw that what should've been $1.87 was $0.187
 
So I got away with 8 gallons of gas for a buck and a half. 
Good times.
 
So after a night of raunchy and rowdy filth, people, and musicians--I drove back to town this morning because I could not miss church as I am a member of the choir :)

Gwen Stefani's new album is SO good.
 
That cd is hot.  I mean REALLY hot.
 
I bought the album that came with a little L.A.M.B. cd case to go with it--its all cute and suede or something.   
 
It makes you wanna shake your ass and hump like hell beasts.
 
But yeah this album is HOT.    Like Hotness.    So go buy it."

 X-cite, X-press, X-amine                    
 What has truly, truly come                  
All in all, it never came;                  
 Only water to the flame                     
 X-tinguish what was never done              
Laughter in a bottled shrine               
 Revisits memories, yours and mine         
 Dull in grace, but sharp as wine           
Lets loose the fears and thoughts malign     
 Only led to bitter speech                   
 Words of rage that never reach             
Moments of my own despair                   
 Only love was never there                   
 Silent as a dead man's prayer               
Echoed weeping soaked the air               
 Turning to the shrine again                 
 Bottled ire my only friend                  
Letters by a inkless pen                    
 Tell you all you need to know               
 What I'd give I cannot show                 
Only that I've loved you so                  
 What in life I cannot do                    
 Fall so out of love with you                
Venting in a quiet room                     
 Tranquil as a silent tomb                   
 The storm has ended in my mind              
Enchanted by her still, and still left behind"

Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cos I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you

More than words

Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me

"event","So we did kareoke last night at some bar'n'steakhouse place.
 
I opened up with ""Twelfth Of Never"" by Johnny Mathis and I feel I did pretty good considering the girl who runs it came out of her booth to see if I was actually singing or not as she said looking me up and down ""I'm juss tryin to figure out where that voice is comin from!""
 
I followed it up with Chris Isaak ""Let Me Down Easy"".
 
David did his usual Weezer ""Hashpipe"" and STP ""Interstate Love Song"" and did a good job on it.
 
We convinced Clara to sing provided I go up there and help her out so we did ""Underneath It All"" by No Doubt. Everybody of course LOVED Clara for that. hehe...drunk people...
 
I went up again and sang ""When The Levee Breaks"" by Led Zeppelin.  I followed that one with ""Luck Be A Lady"" by Frank Siantra and nailed it. 
 
They then annouced they were doing a one-song contest for a prize and we all jumped on it.  David sang ""Are You Gonna Go My Way"", Clara sang ""Fallin'"", Sissy the drunk lady sang ""Diamonds Are A Girls's Best Friend"", some other guy sang a Creed song, Matt sang ""Sexual Healing"", and I sang ""Sunspot Baby"".  The Creed guy and Matt tied for 1st and I came in 2nd by 1 point.  They both got a gift certificate and some Cottonmouth tickets.  I walked out with shame........... nah just kidding.
 
That just means I need to pick a better song next time. Oh well.
 
That's for that. I'm going to Atlanta in a few minutes.
 
Have a nice Thanxgiving yo."

Michael:  I have tried and tried to be the friend that a friend would like to have with you.  Unfortunately, at every turn of the corner I find sharp objects impaled in my back.  I hope that life improves for you and that you find a happier place for yourself and your romantic future, but until you come to terms with the fact that you are who you are and decide that you are happy with that, you will never be able to be happy with anyone else.  I saw Eric last night and he told me something that once again only confirmed my concerns about you and he talking again.  I wish the best for you, but I just feel like I can not be friends with you any longer.


Ryno:  I love you so much.  You are a great person. I hope you can find true happiness with BOB.  You are so dear to me and I have failed on so many occasions to show that better.  You are one of the few people I will truly miss.  I will call you with my new contact info in the near future so you can come visit.

Eric:  What needed to be said, was said last night.  I am sorry, I truly am.  I wish you the best and hope you are able to achieve everything you desire.

As for the rest of Los Angeles, I hope that in the next big quake, that this shit hole of a sespool of vanity and shallowness, falls where it belongs into the bottom of the ocean. I will not miss any of it, those I care about and love know who they are and the rest of this shit hole can rot in the soddom and Ghamora fashion that it so richly deserves.

"event","Life has been kind of depressing lately, so I have chosen to hold off on posting for a while.

I love my job, I hate my employer pretty much sums up how things are going for me.

I was not able to make my trip to NorCal as I had hoped for the last X-mas in my childhood home.  I instead worked a 72hour shift that started on Thursday night at 6 and ended on Sunday night at 6.  The only truly sad moment was on christmas night when I had someone's grandmother expire right in front of me on their living room floor.  I worked her up and shortly after arriving at Cedar's the MD called it.  The Nurse told the family who was outside the room and the woman just crumpled.  The whole family was standing there crying, what a way to end your christmas.

I called out sick yesterday so that I could have 2 days off in a row.  The house has been severely neglected and I need to clean and do some other things.  

Luckily payday is tommorow, otherwise I would be in trouble.  I hosted a friend from Canada a few weeks back.  Did all the touristy stuff. Had a great time but was broke and expected to get a check from AMR for the retroactive pay they owe all of us, but of course as usual my company reniged on it and so now we are all waiting till january for our retro pay.

I wish I could report something exciting in my romantic life, but alas I can not.  Hell I am not even having sex with anyone other than me.  Oh well such is the life of the work-a-holic.  The two days off just make these facts even more obvious, but I have been keeping busy with chores to distract myself.

I have been reading all of your journals and am gald most of you are doing well.

HUGS

"event","THIS IS A CALL TO ARMS FOR ALL GLBT PEOPLE OF THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:

Now is the time to fight the power.  Do not lie down and take this.  This is our country too, not just those hillbilly, right wing, christian fuckheads.  Stand Up, To ARMS it is time to defend this great country of ours and let them know that we will not stand for religion in our government and that we will not just go away and that this discrimination that many states of the union passed will not be alolowed to stand unchallenged.  Blacks, Jews and many other races have fought for their rights, it is now our time to stand up and tell this country, ""Give me liberty or give me death.""  The declaration of independence, the constitution all of these documents proclaim that ""All men are created equal"".  Not just heterosexual men and women ""ALL MEN"".  ""Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"", the government is systematically walking on our right to life, liberty and our pursuit of happiness, we must let them know that this blatant discrimination will not be tolerated.

joining Gay and Lesbian groups is a great start as I and many of my friends plan on becoming more active in the community out of protest of this situation.  Another group to join is the gay marriage advancement groups.  Even if you do not want to get married it is the point that a particular group of people are being discriminated against in this country, if they had done this to blacks or mexicans this country would be outraged.  How is what they are doing to Gays and Lesbians any different.  

The other thing we need to all do, is contact our senators and congress people and let them know how offended and pissed off we are by all of this.  We also need to let John Kerry and John Edwards, both still U.S. Senators know that we still support them and that we expect them to be a thorn in the side of this ""False King"" every motherfucking step of the way.

I am extremely blessed to be a citizen of the State of California where we are represented by Senator Barbara Boxer, who has been a huge FAG HAG since she took office almost 20 years ago.  I know and will continue to affirm with her and her office that they will be the biggest pain in the ass that this motherfucker has ever had in congress.  Urge your representatives to fight this evil prick on everything he wants to achieve in this country.

This fight is far from over.

""Don't tread on me"".  It worked for our forefathers and it will work for us.  The population of the U.S. Colonies is nowhere near the population of Gays and Lesbian in this country and they took on a whole country and won their freedom, now it is our turn."

Not wanting to look like an idiot again I am now reading this weeks and last weeks assignments.  All this shit is giving me a headache.  Right now we are reading Descates, Locke and Kant.  These three philosophers wrote about the acquisition of knowledge.  Descarte is talking about the method of doubt or knowledge not being based on experience but independent of experience, Locke is an empericist and of course Kant is trying to reconcile the 2 schools of thought.  UGH, it is making my head hurt.  

Then when I am done with this, I have to move on to the section about the nature of casual relationships, where I will read works by hume another empericist.

Phone calls are returned and e-mails are answered. I know I am attached.  All signs point to it being reciprocal.  I know there are alot of things to work out, but I am tired of finishing last.  Mutual interests as well as seperate interests point to high compatability factors.  The tenderness, loving and general care shown is just simply amazing.  The concern for me and my feelings is reminicent of better times in my life.  I refuse to use the L word until everything is cleared up.  Friendships are meant to be a 2 way street and I feel like this one is a freaking 8 lane freeway.  Family is in town from PA so I will not have time till next week and that is a good test for me.

Now that I have said my peace on that subject, on to more important things.  This week is the first set of 2 midterms in the semester.  Monday night was Algebra, tonight was Philosophy.  Tonight I did a 900 word paper on the manifesto of Ted Kazinsky better know as the Unabomber which was required reading in the class.  My subject was his philosophy on the Logistics of Convienences.  Basically it is the theory that technology is presented as an option to make you life easier and that over time it becomes a neccesity and that those who do not adapt to it are left behind by society.  I think I did an awesome job all though at the end I was sweating it since my laptop battery was about to die.  Just as I hit the save button and it save my paper to floppy the laptop went to standby mode.  Luckily my work was saved and was able to turn it in.  Saved by the bell.

Work has been insanely busy, for some reason EMS is busier during the summer, I think it is the proponderance of people who are home vs. the normal year.

We covered basic arithmatic, intergers and single variable linear equations.  I think I did really well.  it was a 300 question test and took me the better part of 3 hours to complete.  By the time the test was over my brain was fried.  

I crawled to the bus stop and took the bus home and stoppped at the store on my way home for some comfort food.  

Tommorow night I have my 1st philosophy midterm, it is a 700 minimum word essay one a reading of our choice out of the 12 we have read so far.  i think I am going to do it on Plato's The Apology, Phaedo and Crito, which is the trial, imoortality and death of socrates.

Other than that work is being a bit of a bitch and the 24hr shift I want has been put on hold for a month.  It would put me closer to home and school.

Had to take a cab to work this a.m. since none of the buses would get me to work on time...freaking metro weekends, that was $15 I really did not have to spend.  Other than that things are good, could not sleep yesterday, went to bed at 10 got up at 5.  Going to work on the project today and watch some college ball.  That is about it for now. Hope you are all well.

So here I sit on my 24hr shift and I am able to get online to ease some of the boredome.  It is slow as hell, but at least I feel connected to the outside world.

I smell you on my skin
Your touch, your skin, your smile, your embrace
You held me to you
You told me you liked my touch
You let me hold you
It was all so wonderful
I did not want you to leave
But I understand why you had to

To see you, when I wake up 
is a gift I didn't think could be real.
To know that you feel the same as I do 
is a three-fold utopian dream.
You do something to me 
that I can't explain.
So would I be out of line 
if I said, I miss you.(?)
I see your picture, 
I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine.
You have only been gone ten days, 
but already I'm wastin away.
I know I'll see you again 
whether far or soon.
But I need you to know 
that I care and I miss you."

The cat who used to be know as Archer will now go by the name of ""The Evil One""

Well ""The Evil One"" went into rob's <lj user=""robco""> room an did something, although I do not know what.  I just hurt boxes falling over or something...sorry Rob, you will have to check it out when you get back.

Other than that I had a very nice conversation with a girl from work whom I am friends with.  Single mom of two and all arund awesome gal.  She helped me understand the situtation with me and the man I posted about the other day is very dangerous for me.  She is more worried about me getting hurt than anything else.  I will think about it.  For those of you who know what I am talking about, if you want clarification you can call me.

Other than that, just cleaning and then more studying.

I will try and keep the house clean for your return Rob.

On this occasion of the 3rd yr anniversary of the tragedy where I lost many of my fellow EMS workers in the FDNY, I would ask that you take a moment out of your day at some point to quietly reflect on the ultimate sacrafice these men and women where called upon to take on that horrific when the towers came down.  

Many of the FDNY EMS workers that perished that day where men and women I spent a year and a half living among and sharing a communal experience with.  

Everyday those of us in EMS and other Emergency Services go out onto the streets and go into harms way without question or hesitation.  I would ask you to stop for just a moment and reflect on that and any other thoughts or prayers you may have.  

Furthermore, if you see any emergency worker on this day, tell them thank you, thank you for being the one their for me in my time of most desperate need without question and without hesitation.  

Thank you for your time."

I arrive at 6 go to my classroom and sit down and wait for class to start at 6:45.  By 7:15 I go seek out another professor who instructs me to go to the Academic Affairs office and report that our professor is not there.  They give us a sign in sheet and tell us to go home.  How pissed off am I??  Fucking go to school on my day off and the professor can not even be bothered to show up.  If we miss class on the first day we get dropped, but she can show up anytime she feels like it.  Yay for fucking college."

"event","Hello All,

Well the first week of college is almost over.  My algebra course is going to be challenging just as I thought it would.  My Philosophy instructor is amazing, I think he is going to make the course alot of fun.  My Sociology class I can tell is going to challenge alot of my views and perspectives on life.  I will thoroughly enjoy it though.  Tommorow night is Psychology, I am really looking forward to this class as I recall all my old psych classes where so much fun.  

Other than that my supervisors have been thoroughly understanding that I could not get off work late this week since I will be dropped if I am not on there on the first night of class.  All of my professors are very understanding about me not going to be on time to class every night.  Most said that they were not worried about me.

I am being a social hermit since my limited free time needs to be spent doing homework or reading.  My Math class has a ton of homework 6 hours weekly, my Philosophy class is reading intensive and my Sociology class is going to be writing intesive.  I can not wait to see what my Psych prof piles on me.  I am really enjoying being back in school and I had forgotten how much college challenges me and I love it.

Hope you are all well.

Hugs,

Paul"

"event","So tonight I sacraficed all the months of hard work and time I have put into building up my self confidence in regards to my looks.  I did the friend thing and accompanied my new roommate to a west hollywood type bar in Venice called the rooster fish.  Nothing like being surrounded by a bar full of people whom you find attractive, knowing that none of them want to give you the time of day or even acknowledge your exsistence.  I stood in a quiet corner nursing a beer and watching the interactions of the crowd and the men who cruised Rob who could have cared less.  I watched as Rob talked to all his twinky friends and flitted about the bar.  So here I sit listening to my vertical horizons collections that puts my feelings in music perfectly.  Everything you want seems to fit here as well as your a god.  The kharma points I have earned for my deed will be rewarded I am sure, but it does not make it hurt any less.

This is dedicated to the beautiful people:

I've got to be honest
I think you know
We're covered in lies and that's OK
There's somewhere beyond this I know
But I hope I can find the words to say 

Never again no
No never again 

Chorus
'Cause you're a god
And I am not
And I just thought
That you would know
You're a god
And I am not
And I just thought
I'd let you go 

But I've been unable
To put you down
I'm still learning things I ought to know by now
It's under the table so
I need something more to show somehow 

Never again no
No never again

"event","This being the last day of the month, I figured I would comment on the unusual rain fall for the month. I am not sure of the official totals, but, I can not remember the brook in my yard ever running so high. Over a nine day period this month, it seems like the rain was consistently moderate to heavy. After the rain stopped falling, I took many pictures of my yard and the state park 1/4 mile upstream. Check this link to see a few of the selected shots.

"event","The destruction in the south east United States is the simply awful. It breaks my heart that this is happening in my country. I just finished listening to 
the New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin. He is pissed off and desperate. At the very end of the audio clip it sounds like the interviewers are brought to tears. In this interview he discusses the problems with drug addicts roving the streets causing mayhem. 

Unbelievable.

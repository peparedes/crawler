There you go, theres some eye candy for you.

Now about last night, all of a sudden i was depressed and fucking it sucked and I don't know why i was depressed. People that know me know I got this emotional disease, I used to take meds but they sucked an made me feel sickly so i smoked massive amounts of pot, but i dont smoke no more i quit to better myself. Well anyways i dont know what to do I dont want to take meds cus they make me feel like shit not mentally but physically, should i go back to smoking? Plus I am in love with this girl from Rhode Island and i known her for years, so what should I do about that? Should i tell her how i feel? I am sure she already knows but yeah i dont think she would feel the same. Thats all i got to say about that. So there, here is a nice update for you LJers :X.

These Lyrics are deep.


Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you, for you
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you

As years go by
I race the clock with you
But if you died right now
You know that I'd die to
I'd die too

You remind me of the times
When I knew who I was (I was)
But still the second hand will catch us
Like it always does

We'll make the same mistakes
I'll take the fall for you
I hope you need this now
Cause I know I still do

Until the day I die (Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you
Until the day I die (Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you

Should I bite my tongue?
Until blood soaks my shirt
We'll never fall apart
Tell me why this hurts so much

My hands are at your throat
And I think I hate you
But still we'll say, ""remember when""
Just like we always do
Just like we always do

Until the day I die (Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you
Until the day I die (Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you

Yeah I'd spill my heart!!!
Yeah I'd spill my heart for you!!!

My hands are at your throat
And I think I hate you
We made the same mistakes
Mistakes like friends do

My hands are at your throat
And I think I hate you
We made the same mistakes
Made the same mistakes

Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you, for you

Until the day I die (Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you, for you
Until the day I die (Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you
Until the day I die (Until the day I die)
Until the day I die!!!

Well i was going pretty fast cus i wanted to go home a.s.a.p cus i been having a sinus headache for like a week now an it wont go away. Well anyways back to the story, I was driving along and i turned off my highbeams and i see this 9-10 foot dark thing walking, now I'm spooked cus im like WTF WAS THAT and it like ran across the road like a bat out of hell, I know this wasnt a bear cus delaware doesnt have bears and it was walking on two feet, so as a quick reaction i did a 360 to check out what it was. Now people here heard stories from the local Injuns that a woods monsters lives in the woods an you should leave it food an it wont bother you, they used to tell the early settlers of Delaware. Now I'm sure you all are like uh a woods monster?, well I'm talking about Bigfoot, now i looked up shit on him after i came home cus I am sure I saw what i saw I'm not crazy. There has been sightings of him/her in the area i was at before. Now since today i go off I am going there to check shit out cus this has got my attention i want to get footage of this thing, its my goal in life, i know it's out there and i know what i saw. Wish me luck, this is a big deal to me.

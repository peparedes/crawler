"event","The day began with pancakes, which is always a good sign.  So I downed my shotgun, set the other survivors their search tasks, and with lemon and sugar in hand sought sustenance.

The day's quality hovered close to danger for a time; having to abandon the barricades during a zombie assault and answer the doorbell - where I was confronted by an equally cadaverous pair of gap-toothed old biddies spreading Jehovah's Message (tm) was pretty worrisome.  They couldn't bring themselves to face me long, though, clearly the sight of me in my dressing gown left them the distinct impression of ""Oh dearie me, it's a den of sin, time to drop a leaflet and run.""

Thusly they shambled off, and I dashed back to my vantage point and resumed unloading the Barrett into the horde, saving the day in the nick of time.

Some foo' on the radio couldn't name this artist, Heroes S1 is done airing, Lost has been confirmed for more seasons, clearly there *is* an impending apocalypse, but the zombies are gone and there's still coffee in the pot.  Righteous."

"event","<a href=""http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm"">This game</a> is far too cute and addictive.  Although the music drives me up the wall over time.

Ked has a lot to answer for, linking me to it.  I haven't even beaten his million score yet, either, although the morning is young and there is coffee left in my mug, so...

I am now sticking headphones on and listening to OMR turned up fairly loud, as the most potent cure for catchy repetitive flash game music I can think of at this time.  Bit early in the day for it, I suppose, but needs must.

Only a day to go 'til graphics card arrives, supposedly :o so woo yay excited.  Yes, I went shopping online with very little practical forethought and spent money I probably shouldn't.  But it will be pretty and I've hardly spent /anything/ in an age so it's hardly gonna become a habit.

And yes, I am feeling strangely self-conscious of having done it, for no reason I can readily define.  I don't know why I'm always so driven to have thorough reasonings and explanations for my every notable action available on demand, probably the school years spent as a serial liar and accompanying backlash I suppose.

Think I'm expected to go Vanquish stuff in GW with Ked + Nicki + probably Gar later, but somehow I don't expect that to happen.  For one, Nicki's probably not reinstalled or patched GW up to date yet after yesterday's reformat/reinstall of Windows.  For another, I'm lazy and lacking GW motivation these days, no real goals to work toward that I actually really feel I want to.  With Ginseng's FoW armour sorted and Cel's skill capping done, well, I don't even have much use for any monetary gains, so might as well just stay a pauper.

Oh well.  I spend too much time at the PC anyway, having less to do on it can't be bad really :D"

Been considering restarting here for a while, so gonna give it a go.  Will aim for public security level rather than private I guess, so read at your own risk, gonna be trying not to concern myself with making things palatable for others.  As someone noted to me not so long ago, LJs are mostly about self-absorbtion, and I got plenty o' that to work through.

So, presently, I'm all contemplative, right, to the point where Nicki is kinda concerned and I'm neglecting conversation on Xfire, making this an ideal moment to ramble on for an age here.  But for this moment, I will be sensible and instead go to bed.

So yes, this is an entry to tell y'all that I am in fact going to post things that you may or may not concern you, if indeed I post at all, but that contains no such things.

"event","Huh.

Many many many years ago, my French teacher Corinne, who recently departed my old primary school for some reason, taught our class of the French tradition of sticking paper fish on folks' backs.  Many years later, I 'realised' that this had been an elaborate hoax itself, because surely even the French weren't that odd as a nation.

Of course, it never occurred to me to actually check the veracity of the matter, but it would now appear that it's genuine, and that I actually wound up fooling <i>myself</i> again this year when it came around to April 1st and I mused on having been fooled by Corinne back then.  And indeed, if I hadn't been reminded of this yet again by reading past posts in Neil Gaiman's LJ feed, I might never have seen fit to check.

Moral[s] of this story:  Never doubt your French teacher!  Google is your friend!  Check your livejournal often!  Keep your laser handy!

Inothernews, yes, I'm still alive.  No, I know it's been ages.  Yes, I really have been wasting my time playing <a href=""http://www.guildwars.com"">silly computer games</a>.  More recently I have been <lj-cut text=""doing more useful things."">crawling through loft spaces, under pipes behind boilers, and in long low office cupboards dragging cables around; making tea and eating cornish pasties; assembling and washing and transporting garden furniture; applying sealant, sanding, and painting things; rising early and napping during lunch breaks, and despairing at the lack of Wensleydale cheese attached to the ropes I have to pull through places.

Mostly next week I'll be on Gypsycon preparation duty rather than cabling though, I expect, since we've but a couple of cables left to run across the house and I'm not even sure whether we'll get those done 'cos the bathroom floor needs sanding and whitewashing and that ain't gonna be easy if I'm plonking a ladder up to the loft hatch in the middle of it or dragging shelving units out of their cupboards onto it to get behind them.

Upside, I finish this coming Woden's Day, and get a whole day's sleep before I wind up back there again for the actual conning of gypsies.</lj-cut>

<i>You are a WEDL--Wacky Emotional Destructive Leader. This makes you a Anarchist.

You don't give a damn. When push comes to shove, you just forget about it--it's just not worth the heartache. What this means for others is that dealing with you can be aggravating, because they find they can't get you motivated about things they care about. What this means for you is that you are happier, calmer, and saner then they are on their best days.

You are near-immune to criticism, and those who know you well acknowledge and respect that. You may come across as lazy, but the truth is that you find little to get worked up about. Regardless, you have slews of friends, because they are fascinated by your world view, jealous of your lifestyle, and drawn to the fact that you are hilarious to be around. 

You are a pillar in a sea of hot-bloodedness. You have a sweet tooth.

This morning I spoke to a mental health nurse called Jim.  I did so last Wednesday too.  Next I'll get an appointment to see some psychologist fellow and I'll talk to him too.  In the meantime I'll sit here and feel tired and restless and want to tear out my eyes with my fingernails for no good reason other than they itch in a manner I can't abide.  Same goes for most of the rest of me really.

New shower is being plumbed in this week, amongst other things.  Slow going 'cos nothing in this house goes right, and 'cos the parts supplier is being a fucktard.

Played Exalted this weekend, had much good fun.  Incinerated the unrighteous with near-psychotic zeal, just as I always wanted to.  Scared the GM with the amount of damage I could dish out.  Considered revising character's abilities for game balance's sake, 'cos the rules as written are scary.

Bought strange books on Hindu stuff and the wild west, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/origamifox"">wrote more odd things</a>, and read <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~cadhla/503858.html"">a phenomenally cool poem</a> I stumbled across.  Don't want to go to yoga tonight.  Might anyway.

Running Exalted this coming weekend.  Looking forward to it most of the time.  Need to write more stuff, though, and feel like shit, so may well wind up underprepared.

Watched Equilibrium last week.  Crap film, but groovy action scenes.  Mental note: Watch some kung fu movies this week.  Also, experiment with KotOR and attempt to replicate strange lightsaber trick Rob described last Tuesday.  Could be pretty.

I should listen to less Thea Gilmore music.  I really should."

"event","Well, this is nice.

New antidepressants.  Always fun to start 'em.

The first onslaught of headache, nausea, muscle-cramping, tremors and sweating started no more than a few hours after the first dose, after my evening meal.  It's really <i>quite</i> entertaining, I must say; it's just like having downed fifty asprin and a couple of vodka shots, except without the hissing in my ears.

Doesn't matter, really.  Still got an echo of the hissing from last time; some things stay with you, and silence isn't one of them for me.

What's funny is that I know I don't respond well to medication.  They've - <i>we've</i> tried a few things in the past, from your standard Prozac to antipsychotics (though I suppose I should wonder quite why they had me on those - the latest doctor certainly did) and of course there have been my own, extra-fun self-medication attempts to solve the case once and for all.

So I know how it feels for my body to start fighting back against having shit it doesn't like pumped into it, and I know what activated charcoal tastes like.  If there's anything that can possibly put even the most crazed suicide nut off overdoses - or perhaps just harden their resolve so they make sure it <i>works</i>, it's activated charcoal.  I still have a t-shirt or two with faint marks from vomiting that black tar across them, over and over and over, until I had nothing left to give.  And then carrying on regardless - I've never been good at throwing up; never knew when to stop.

Still, it's all experience.  Must be good for you, right?  Makes you a better, more rounded, more developed individual.  Yeah, I can already tell a lot of folk won't agree with that philosophy right now, from the simple fact that I don't right now either.  Then again, right now something given me to help me sort myself out is reminding me just what it's like to stop trying, and it's not a great argument to choose when your debating partner doesn't give a flying fuck <i>how</i> the discomfort stops, so long as it stops.

Anyway, this entry is kinda pointless I suppose, especially since I've just lost interest in it and will thus not bother to bring it to a meaningful conclusion, but am still [insert random mood here] enough to post the fucker.

Every FTF game I'm in apart from mine and probably Neil's games are cancelled as of last Thursday.  I've got a bloody sore throat from coughing for the past four days.  I'm still lacking most of my sense of balance.  I've got a headache like a branding iron shoved into the right side of my brain.  I'm on the mend, but still far from well, basically, and until ten minutes ago was still feeling bloody miserable.

Ten minutes ago, the phone rang, and I croaked ""Hello?"" and Claire said ""Hello"" back.

<a href=""http://totl.net/VirusScanner/?"">Human Virus Scanner</a>

<lj-cut text=""my diagnosis is not good...""><b>Human Virus Scanner</b>
The virus that have infected you will be show here along with thier cures, if known.

<b>Viruses you suffer from:</b>

<b>USA</b>
Rule, Britannia! Britannia rule the waves! [repeat]

<b>Junkfood</b>
Eat some real food. Something which you can identify the source of every ingredient, not the point of manufacture.

<b>Sci-fi</b>
Stop wearing the stick-on ears.

<b>Gaming</b>
Life is not a game. Roll 3D6. On a 4 or more go out and do something with your life.

<b>BBCB</b>
CTRL-Break, and get a real computer. Repeat: ""Mode 7 was not a good thing.""

<b>Religion</b>
Read ""God's Debris"" by Scott Adams (yes, the Dilbert guy)

<b>8-Bit</b>
Polygons, all the polygons you can get are not enough. 

<b>British</b>
No need for cure. Benign virus.

<b>Discordia</b>
Buy a suit. Invest your money. Eat hotdog buns on a friday. 

<b>Politics</b>
Stop caring!

<b>Brand Names</b>
Having a well-known name doesn't make it good.

<b>Computer Games</b>
Stop staring at the screen and get some fresh air. You should see a doctor about the RSI in your thumbs.

<b>Conspiracy Theory</b>
Face it, the elected government is in control. Actually that's quite scary.

<b>Environmentalism</b>
Consume more stuff! It's easier to buy new stuff than to recycle.

<b>Viruses you might suffer from:</b>

<b>Linux (93%)</b>
Install the latest version of Microsoft Windows. Learn to love it.

<b>Industrial (70%)</b>
Everyone likes folk. No, really. Maybe you should listen to the Incredible String Band.

<b>Amiga (80%)</b>
Gnome is better than workbench. BEOS is better than Amiga OS. The TV Modulator was a pain in the arse and an EXTERNAL power pack? I ask you. And it didn't have a built in MIDI port like some of its rivals. 

<b>UNIX (75%)</b>
Anything this old must be obselete. Go and install a nice modern operating system. I hear MSDOS has come a long way lately.

<b>X11 (90%)</b>
I hear Mac OS 10 Aqua is nice at this time of year.

<b>Hippyism (65%)</b>
Free love is passe and potentially dangerous, and patchouli smells like cat piss.

<b>Prog Rock (60%)</b>
Long hair looks dumb with a bald spot. Listen to CD's they don't crackle.

<b>Football (75%)</b>
Do something unhealthy and indoors, away from the Bears.

First job: Landscaping.
First screen name: Jahangir, later shortened to Jah.
First funeral: ...will probably be some time from now.
First pet: I don't think I've ever been directly responsible for a pet.
First piercing/tattoo: ...will be considered only after my first funeral.
First credit card: Aiee, horrid things.  Get them away from me.
First Kiss: Elaine...  no, wait.  It was some girl I never knew the name of, a year or so above me at secondary school.
First one that mattered: <lj user=""jasmine"">, though I suppose Elaine mattered at the time.
First love: Velcro, one of Gypsy's cats.
First enemy: Um.  Well, there were a lot of people who bullied me a bit at school.  I don't really count those as enemies, though, just fuckwits I knew.  And of the people I got into fights with, I don't think I really disliked any of them all that much, except Chris wossisname and he didn't seem to bear me much ill will, even after spending the day in hospital.  So, um, no real enemies I suppose.
First big trip: Singapore.
First concert: Hm!  I think it was a Queen-soundalike one.  They were crap, whoever they were.
First musician you remember hearing in your house: Queen, I think.  I don't really remember it for sure, but they're the first band in my mental 'artists recognised' list.

LASTS

Last car ride: Yesterday, getting some stuff from the butcher for mum.
Last kiss: A year ago, I guess, if you don't count friendly pecks upon the cheek.
Last library book checked out: The Bhagavad Gita, Eknath Easwaran's translation thereof.
Last movie watched: Photographing Fairies, tail end thereof.  Bloody depressing for some reason, and not particularly good for that matter.
Last beverage drank: Coffee!
Last food consumed: Toasted sand-witch.
Last phone call: <lj user=""jasmine""> probably, or possibly Jo, my sense of time isn't good.
Last time showered: This morning.
Last CD played: Alanis Morissette - MTV Unplugged.
Last annoyance: Having to wash dad's car in the freeeezing cold.
Last soda drank: Vanilla coke, at <lj user=""jasmine"">'s house.
Last ice cream eaten: Vanilla Swedish Glace (dairy-free stuff), last week.
Last time scolded: Last year, via email, by Gypsy.  Not exactly scolding as such, but close enough.
Last shirt worn: One of several black ones.
Last website visited: rebecca.hitherby.com

NOW

Single or Taken: Um, yeah.
Sex: No thank you, I'm British.
Birthday: 21st of June.  I was greedy and picked the summer solstice, y'see.
Sign: Cancer/Gemini cusp.
Siblings: One brother, ten years older than I.
Hair color: Brown.  Was blond when I was a kiddie, though, much to my shame.
Eye color: Usually brown.
Shoe size: Tennish.
Height: 5'6"", give or take a bit.

RIGHT NOW, WHAT ARE YOU

Wearing: Black.
Drinking: Not enough coffee.
Thinking about: Coffee, black, this survey, vampires and the shitness of the world's present state.
Listening to: Many of my favourite songs of all time, all on one playlist.</lj-cut>"

In breaking news, the man himself was reported to have been muttering to himself and sounding mightily morose in his usual angsty twice-baked gloom cookie fashion.  In fact, really, there's no news at all; he's just thinking the same old shit.

You know the stuff - thoughts like ""When was the last time I was glad to wake up?"" and that old favourite ""Why the fuck do I post here?  Does anyone even want to read me bitching about my pathetic excuse for a life?  Do I?  No, I suppose not.""

So here, for no good reason at all it seems, is this post.  I've chopped wood in a wood, I've got a very very very part time job gardening with a friend, I've signed up for pretentious angsty goth twittery at its best, I'm utterly fucking depressed, and I'm going to bed.

That was the news at 2am.  Good night."

He's drinking green tea.  There's a hint of lemon in it too.  It's refreshing!

He's musing on the nature of importance, and wondering in whose eyes he's important.  Does he find an answer?

It's not important.

He's musing on the nature of refreshment, and wondering if it's worth being refreshed when he's not actually going to do anything.  Or is he?  It's a mystery!

Perhaps later he'll go to the kitchen, and take the cook's role.  Perhaps he'll cook a cow.

Cows are often stolen by small blue men, but sometimes intense young girls can make them put them back.  It's not important to this story, though.

He won't cook a whole cow, anyway.  Small blue men might come and steal it if he had a whole one.

Hm!

Maybe some things are more important than you first realise!"

T-Texas

a p p e a r a n c e
HEIGHT: 5'6ish?
HAIR : Brown
SKIN COLOR: Pale but otherwise appropriate to someone disguised as a human
EYE COLOR: Brown, usually
PIERCINGS: None
TATTOOS: None

d o y o u
GET MOTION SICKNESS?: Not so far.  Clearly, I should try more dangerous hobbies.
HAVE A BAD HABIT?: No, no.  I haven't joined a monastery yet.
GET ALONG WITH YOUR PARENTS?: I suppose so, though this probably due mainly to lack of communication.
LIKE TO DRIVE?: Sometimes.  Particularly when it's very late, the roads are quiet, and I've got the radio on full blast, singing merrily along as I blaze down the motorway with the windows wide open.


h a v e y o u
BROKEN THE LAW: Yes, but I glued it back together afterward.
RAN AWAY FROM HOME: Nope, don't reckon so.  Couldn't leave all my roleplaying books behind...
SNUCK OUT OF THE HOUSE: But of course.  I must emulate Ninja Tathagata, and thus must practice the way of stealth at every opportunity in my search for enlightenment.
EVER GONE SKINNY DIPPING: Nope.
MADE A PRANK PHONE CALL: Several.
EVER TIPPED OVER A PORTA POTTY: Um...  no.
USED YOUR PARENTS' CREDIT CARD BEFORE: Yes, but they still have one, so I clearly didn't use it enough...
SKIPPED SCHOOL BEFORE: Once or twice, but I was more the 'fake illness' type than the 'just disappear' type.
FELL ASLEEP IN THE SHOWER/BATH: Nope.
BEEN IN A SCHOOL PLAY: Possibly back in primary school, I don't remember.
LET A FRIEND CRY ON YOUR SHOULDER: Every now and again.

w h e n / w h a t w a s t h e l a s t
TIME YOU CRIED?: Don't know, offhand.  A while back, sometime last year I think.
YOU GOT A REAL LETTER?: Um...  a while back?
YOU GOT E-MAIL: Yesterday
THING YOU PURCHASED: The latest Exalted rulebook.
TV PROGRAM YOU WATCHED: I think I caught the last half of Revolver earlier in the week.  I don't generally watch TV except for random channel-swapping while waiting for my parents to get out of the bathroom and let me go to bed.
MOVIE YOU SAW AT THE THEATER: Kill Bill, I think.  Last time I watched a film at all, I saw The Last Samurai and Cold Mountain at a friend's house, and that was in the week before The Last Samurai was released in this country.  Whenever that was.

y o u r t h o u g h t s o n
ABORTION: I'd say leave it to the mother to do what's right for her, and the only other person entitled to an opinion on the matter is her partner.  All life is sacred, but the parents got there first, and there's no sense bringing another life into the world if it'll destroy theirs.
TEENAGE SMOKING: The world's already overpopulated.  If people want to risk lung cancer, let 'em.

r a n d o m
DO YOU HAVE A JOB: Nope.
YOUR CD PLAYER HAS IN IT RIGHT NOW: Some Katie Melua, some Eva Cassidy, some Enigma, some Delerium, and a little of The Gathering.
IF YOU WERE A CRAYON, WHAT COLOR WOULD YOU BE?: I wouldn't have a colour of my own, I'd be a magic chameleon crayon.  With lazer eyes and the special mutant power of flight, along with a quest to rid the world of woglies.
WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?: Friends, silliness, music, sunshine and rain, full moons, good books, mindboggling things and some flavours of deep thought, talking quasi-philosophical crap in the early hours of the morning, and so on.
WHO MAKES YOU THE HAPPIEST?: I'm not someone who can measure things like that.
WHO DO YOU CONSIDER GOOD FRIENDS?: I don't really have any friends I <i>don't</i> consider good.  Some are closer than others, but different dynamics are good for different things, you know?</lj-cut>"

ANGER
1. Who did you last get angry with? Myself, I think.
2. What is your weapon of choice? Words, fists or knives.  Depends.
3. Would you hit a member of the opposite sex? When I am at the point of hitting people, gender no longer matters.  Only range.
4. How about of the same sex? See above.
5. Who was the last person who got really angry at you? Probably <lj user=""jasmine"">, otherwise Jill.
6. What is your pet peeve? Being ignored when I don't want to be, and not being ignored when I do.
7. Do you keep grudges, or can you let them go easily?  I have trouble holding onto them.  Slippery buggers, grudges.  Kinda like eels I suppose.  Although you shouldn't call eels buggers, as it brings on rather disturbing imagery and might give them ideas.  Though still not as disturbing as those tropical fish that try and jump into your penis while you're pissing...  now <i>there's</i> a nature program I wish I hadn't watched.  Never use foreign rivers as toilets.

Okay, back on topic.

SLOTH
1. What is one thing you're supposed to do daily that you haven't done in a long time?  Meditate.
2. What is the latest you've ever woken up?  About two in the afternoon, I think.  'twas a very rushed day after that.
3. Name a person you've been meaning to contact, but haven't?  Lilly.
4. What is the last lame excuse you made?  I try not to make lame excuses anymore.  If I don't have a reasonably good one, I don't <i>usually</i> bother with one at all.
5. Have you ever watched an infomercial all the way through?  Eh?
6. When was the last time you got a good workout?  Today, I suppose.  If felling, dragging around and sawing up trees counts, which I guess it should.
7. How many times did you hit the snooze button on your alarm clock today?  0.  It was switched off anyway.

GLUTTONY
1. What is your overpriced yuppie beverage of choice?  Don't know, don't drink overpriced yuppie drinks very often, if ever.  I'm too much the caffeine slut to care what sort of coffee I drink.
2. Meat eaters: white meat or red meat?  Probably red.  I likes a good steak now an' then.
3. What is the greatest amount of alcohol you've had in one sitting/outing/event?  Hm.  Around half a bottle of tequila, a quarter of a bottle of vodka, and numerous shots of other things.  I think.  I wasn't really keeping track very well beyond the tequila.  Or was it before?  Eh.
4. Have you ever used a professional diet company?  Uh, no.
5. Do you have an issue with your weight?  Not really.  Some people say I should put some on.
6. Do you prefer sweets, salty foods, or spicy foods? Spicy.
7. Have you ever looked at a small housepet or child and thought ""Food!""?  Nah.  Children aren't for eating, though I've heard that the fat of an unbaptised male child is useful for flying potions.  Actually, thinking about it, I think the person who said that is among those who think I should put on weight.  Coincidence?

LUST
1. How many people have you seen naked (not counting movies/family)?  I honestly don't know ;)
2. How many people have seen YOU naked (not counting physicians/family)?  Likewise.
3. Have you ever caught yourself staring at the chest/crotch of a member of your gender of choice during a normal conversation?  This is a problem most men have, though I don't think I'm hugely guilty of it.
4. Have you ""done it""?  Wandering hippie hairpieces with sunglasses aren't my type, even if they <i>are</i> respected members of the Addams family.
5. What is your favorite body part on a person of your gender of choice?  Eyes.  Usually.
6. Have you ever been propositioned by a prostitute?  Nope.
7. Have you ever had to get tested for an STD or pregnancy?  Uh, no... and God help me if I ever have to be tested for the latter.

GREED
1. How many credit cards do you own?  None.  Credit cards are evil.
2. What's your guilty pleasure store?  Leisure Games, or possibly Play.  But I don't really feel guilty about buying from either, so...
3. If you had $1 million, what would you do with it?  Probably very little.
4. Would you rather be rich, or famous?  Rich.
5. Would you accept a boring job if it meant you would make megabucks?  I believe so.
6. Have you ever stolen anything?  Once, though if you count mp3s and pdf rulebooks, I am exceedingly guilty indeed.
7. How many MP3s are on your hard drive?  Five thousand, three hundred and eighty one...  and counting.

PRIDE
1. What one thing have you done that you're most proud of?  Probably some of my writings.
2. What one thing have you done that your parents are most proud of?  Wouldn't know, can't imagine.
3. What thing would you like to accomplish in your life?  Achieving some measure of inner peace.
4. Do you get annoyed by coming in second place?  Sometimes.
5. Have you ever entered a contest of skill, knowing you were of much higher skill than all the other competitors?  Hai, to my shame.
6. Have you ever cheated on something to get a higher score?  Not that I can remember.
7. What did you do today that you're proud of?  Helped out with woodland maintenance.

ENVY
1. What item (or person) of your friends would you most want to have for your own?  You know, I have no idea right now.  Hm.  Oh well.
2. Who would you want to go on ""Trading Spaces""?  Eh?
3. If you could be anyone else in the world, who would you be?  Whoever Amber Benson's seeing?
4. Have you ever been cheated on?  Um...  actually, now that I think about it, yes.  A long time ago.
5. Have you ever wished you had a physical feature different from your own?  Well, yeah.  I'm not exactly Narcissus.
6. What inborn trait do you see in others that you wish you had for yourself?  Activism.  Maybe stability, too.
7. Do you wish you'd come up with this survey?  Not really.

*. Finally, what is your favorite deadly sin?  Sloth.  Sloths are funny, and strangely cute.

THE SEVEN HEAVENLY VIRTUES

FAITH
1. What religion do you follow?  I don't, really.  I suppose 'eclectic pagan' covers what I believe in though.
2. What religion were you raised as?  I wasn't raised as part of any of them.  Parents wanted me to walk my own path, as it were, without them sending me in any particular direction.
3. Do you believe that forgiveness is a religious property, or a human property?  I believe this is a silly question, but ne'er mind.  Human, anyway.
4. Do you believe in magic?  I do indeed.
5. What was the last promise you broke?  Don't know offhand.
6. Have you ever said the words to a prayer and not meant it?  Nope.
7. Do you believe that anyone could be perfect?  I don't think perfection exists on this earth as an absolute; it may be possible to be perfect for something, but not just 'perfect' - and in any case, I can't <i>define</i> what 'perfect' would be, so I don't see how I need to believe in it or not.  Either it's true or it isn't, and I'll consider it further if it ever becomes relevant.

HOPE
1. Did you get everything you wanted over the last holiday season?  Nah.
2. Regarding your future, what is the best thing you could hope for?  Contentment.  May not get there, but it's worth hoping anyway.
3. Do you let yourself get your hopes up for something even if you know that there is a large chance of failure?  Generally, yes.  But I don't necessarily feel all that let down if I fail under such circumstances.
5. Have you ever bought a lottery ticket?  On behalf of my parents, yes.  For myself, no.
6. Do you gamble?  Not for money.
7. Have you ever had something called off on account of bad weather, but then gone ahead and done it anyway?  Not that I can think of.  Maybe, but nowt major.

CHARITY
1. What causes do you support?  I don't really <i>support</i> any, lazy bum that I am.  I believe in quite a few, though, mostly the conservation/helpfolkinneed/allowfreespeech/etc/etc/treehugginghippy set.
2. What causes have you given money or time to?  Conservation, various other charities, but very little overall.
3. Have you ever worked in a soup kitchen or done another kind of outreach for the homeless?  Nope.
4. Would you ever consider joining the Peace Corps, Amnesty International, or another travel?  Aye, I'd consider it.
5. Do you give money to the homeless on the street?  Sometimes.  Don't see many of 'em round here though.
6. Have you ever helped out a friend with basic needs, like rent or food?  I've never been in a position to do so.
7. What's the greatest extent you've gone to help a friend in need?  No idea.  I don't really think I could easily rank such things in communicable terms.

FORTITUDE
1. What are you most afraid of?  Life, and perhaps losing control.
2. What did you do today that was really brave?  Today hasn't really demanded much bravery at all.  Unless daring to go outside in the pouring rain counts, which I don't really think does.
3. Who is your favorite superhero, and why?  I don't really favour superheroes all that much, and if I did, you wouldn't have heard of them anyway.  Have you heard of Ninja Tathagata?  He's not really a superhero in the conventional sense, but he's my favourite one.
4. Would you put your life in danger to rescue someone?  Don't know, but probably.  I don't really value my own enough not to.
5. If you were to face the Wizard, would you want more courage, more brains, or more heart?  Courage, but I'd also like to know which wizard this means.  There are a lot of 'em, after all.
6. Have you ever gotten stage fright?  Hasn't everyone?
7. Do you consider yourself to be a leader or a follower?  No.

JUSTICE
1. Have you ever been summoned for jury duty?  Nope.
2. If they reinstituted the draft (for both genders), would you go, or would find some way out of it?  Don't know; I'd like to think I'd go, but alas, I also think I'd probably get out of it if I saw a way.
3. Do you support capital punishment (the death penalty)?  Yes, I suppose I do.
4. Which should be guaranteed legal?  Eh?
5. Do you believe that Dubya is rightfully President of the USA?  I don't see how it makes any difference if he has a right to it or not.  He got there regardless, doesn't matter now.
6. What was your favorite media circus trial?  Can't recall the last time I was remotely interested in one, really.
7. Have you ever written a letter to a politician?  Where would be the point of that?

TEMPERANCE
1. What do you have the hardest time moderating yourself on?  Wasting time.  Yup.
2. Do you collect anything?  Exalted rulebooks, and odd ideas.
3. Are you addicted to anything?  Caffeine, chocolate, computers, gaming.  But mostly caffeine.
4. Have you ever put anything on layaway or used an installment plan?  Nope.
5. What's your preferred method of paying for things?  Notes.
6. Tell us one thing you wish you hadn't let yourself do?  Answer this survey.  It's taken far too much of my time already.
7. Do you feel that you obsess over things?  Um, maybe, sometimes.  Just a little.

PRUDENCE
1. Who is the wisest person you know?  Hm!  Lately, Kath, though she'd disagree.
2. Have you ever participated in a vigil?  Nope.
3. Do you take advice when it's given?  Yes, and then I put it away somewhere safe and never look at it again, or give it to someone else without using it myself first.
4. What area are you wisest in?  Giving other people advice I think I ought to have followed as well?
5. Do you drive defensively?  No, but I don't really drive offensively either.
6. Have you ever had unprotected sex outside of marriage?  Nope.
7. What did you learn today?  I learnt about copicing trees, Mongol history, and that Norah Jones' latest album really is damned cool.</lj-cut>"

"event","Last night, it took some time to get to sleep.  Indeed, I found myself wishing I could record my thoughts somehow, so loud and discordant and chaotic they were, so that I could prove to another that I'd had them and what they were like.

Today, the weather has been foul, but not cold.  I spent much of the day outdoors, felling and processing birch trees into 4ft lengths, and enjoyed the change of pace and setting.  Enough trees remained, those guiding the others to stand tall, that the rain bothered us little.

Now, I am comfortably perched in my chair, listening to newly downloaded mp3s and wondering about Mongol culture; it has been a time of considerable length since last I learnt of such, and will soon be time to put use to the little knowledge I possess.

Soon, I will journey downstairs in search of an evening meal; already the smells of spices drift into my room, and awaken a thousand rumblings from my empty stomach.  And after the meal I shall be contented, though filled with anticipation, for the coming of the Outcaste is foretold upon the email system, and my Exalted collection will once more be completed for a time."

"event","Some people are muppets.

Some people, when you try to tell them something without laying it out so clearly you sound like you think they're a muppet, fail to notice your point because they're a muppet.

Some people, when you lay things out clearly, think you think they're a muppet, get all offended by your apparent attitude, and fail to notice your point because they're too busy being offended.

Some people are stealth muppets.

Stealth muppets are people who are really intelligent except on rare occasions when they don't quite grasp something, and only then their muppetry can be seen as no matter which approach you take, they still don't get it.

"event","I don't think I've ever mastered the art of winding down or stopping thinking, really.  And as an aside, it'd be nice to one day discuss something with Jill online that <i>didn't</i> manage to cause aggravation to one or both of us.  But it's probably a vain hope, especially considering our tendencies to be overly blunt and misread each other, and my own tendency to wind up <i>real</i> quick.

And now back to trying to sleep.  Will I dream of dancing the dead bunny tango?  Or won't I?

It's a mystery!

<lj-cut text=""Totally random LJ-cut"">You know, I think I've been less and less coherent in these LJ entries of late.  Maybe I'm losing it.  I wonder if I should keep another journal of all my crazy thoughts?  Would I even want to read it again?  I'd probably just tear it up and burn it like every other written record of my past I've gotten hold of.  See, urge to destroy self always been present.  Mark of crazy.  Funfunfun.  Odd, really.  Some ways, I quite like being me.  Sorta happy.  But other ways, not.  And other ways more dangerous.  One side happy hippy-wanabe without a care in the world, other side reckless self-destructive fuck without a care in the world because he tries not to give a shit about anything and one day won't have to anymore.  One side swears more than the other, I've realised.  But sometimes they're both together and it's hard to tell.  But I suppose it's hard to tell anything when you're me, really.  Objective assessment impossible with empirical evidence.  Oh, sod this.  I could idle the night away talking shit into an LJ entry, and it won't solve anything, only worry or amuse or both any readers.

Well I suppose there's no reason for me to be surprised.

By those results, I mean.  Although it stands well enough when applied to other aspects of my life, much to everyone's consternation including my own.

And now I'm wondering why I even started this update, and thinking that I'll just log off and curl up and go to sleep until Ratatosk falls out of his tree.

But still, I've at least given the appearance of life for a time, what with a vague appearance on here and coffee with an old college friend yesterday, for no reason other than to say hi after two years.  So the world still knows I'm here.  And before that, the weekend, which went really rather well, in fact splendidly especially considering that most of it was improvised as I went along.  Nothing especially real to it, of course, so it won't necessarily all collapse when that's noticed, so um, I was uncertain I had a point to make even when I started this and now I'm really losing faith.  Ironic, really.  If you know where to find the irony, which I'm not sure I do but I'm sure there must be some.

Okay, losing coherence.

As for the canoe, I'm sure I could write something very amusing regarding it.  And I'm sure I will, for there is much to be said of canoes and their ilk, especially in reference to certain aspects of my life and of course desert islands and William Shatner.  Ah, more irony.

Never mind.  Another time, perhaps."

"event","A number of people I know suffer from SAD.  I don't.  I had a pretty damned good Christmas and New Year; great party at Jill's for New Years', and by the end of my friend Karen's 40th party on the 3rd, the world seemed a bright and interesting one with a lot of potential - and one where I had a future and some definite goals.  For a few precious moments, I knew where I was going and what to do; I even knew who to thank for that realisation, and was determined to get whereever it was I was going.

Hell, I think I still have that determination now.  I <i>know</i> I can sort myself out, get a job, get a life, learn to stop hating myself and my existence for whatever stupid reasons I do so, get a hold on my thoughts and generally become the person I wish I was.  I think I was already on that track anyway, sometimes, but I'd gone a little off the rails in recent months.

All that said though, today was a fucking piece of shit.

So was yesterday, and the day before that.  Something to do with coming home to parents who don't speak to me except to tell me to do things and ask if I've done them every fifteen minutes when they know I haven't in their most irritating mock-sincerity.  Never mind trusting me to actually do things I've said I will, oh no.  Never mind actually trying to have a conversation that doesn't involve having a go at me - hell, never mind having conversations at all; they don't happen in this house.  I don't even feel welcome in my own home - then again, I'm fairly certain my father at least is leaning toward the idea that I'm not.

So yeah, I know I can sort myself out.  I know how to.  But it's fucking hard to keep my head straight when everything around me is seemingly designed to keep me in my usual utterly-fucked-off-with-the-universe state.  Hell, there were moments-aplenty when overly-dramatic and improper uses of kitchen knives seemed highly tempting, or possibly a sudden shopping trip to throw myself off a multistory carpark's roof.  But hey, they're just thoughts.  And in a moment, when I post all this, it'll just be words on a web page, and that suits me just fine."

Maybe I'll update with something worthwhile soon.  Maybe I won't.  It's a dilemma!  How will the universe cope?  Will it have to split into multiple parallel systems to accomodate the decision matrices?  Will wacky fun ensue?  Tune in next week.

In the meantime.  Or any other time at all, really.  Doesn't have to be mean, in fact I suppose it might be quite nice.  Um, colon should have been here somewhere to indicate what was being put in to fill the possiblymean-time:

Then spent a short while this afternoon at Gareth's after delivering presents there; discovered much to my amusement that I can do the trip back in only fourty minutes if I break every speed limit on the way.  I do so love driving when the roads are quiet (so there's nobody screaming ""This is <i>my</i> lane, stay in your own!"")

And now I have a shitload of ironing to do, and a lot of tidying-up to be done, but it's Christmas, and I have coffee and sausage rolls too.

Had a rotten cold last week, still got it, but it's shifted more to my chest now; no longer am I runny-nosed and sneezy, but I'm somewhat sore-throated, still washed-out, and not often stopping coughing before 3-4 in the morning long enough to fall asleep.  It's, what, a week before Christmas...  and I haven't started present-shopping yet.  Nor do I really have the money to buy anything anyway, but there we go.

Some good news, though: Mum's driving again, albeit not far and still with considerable difficultly changing gear, but she can get to the shops and back via car.  It's a start."

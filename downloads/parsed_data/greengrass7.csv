"event","So freshman year is almost over now. How sad. I have two finals on thursday and then I go home. My parents just decided to inform me that they plan on leaving friday morning at like 8:30. That may be enough to keep me in thursday night. I have drank enough for the year already. 
   This year has been very interesting. I met new people, some of whom I regret meeting. Had some boys, some of whom I regret as well. Smoked some weed which I regret the most. 
   So moving into Chenango hall with who I thought were lots of bitchy sorority girls was quite an experience. The first few days they tried to intimidate us, but after a while, that intimidation was demolished. 
   I got wasted for the first time here. I will not forget that night at skyline. Now clearly I was way too drunk to keep drinking, but my good friend Brett kept having the drinks coming. It was almost as if he wanted to get me drunk ;) well that night was the first and only time I ever got sick from drinking. After that I decided that I was going to tone down the intake, but did I, of course not! 
   Last semester I was pretty much a mess. Thursday, Friday and Saturday had to consist of going out. What I find funny is, I would always go to the same place, do the same thing and always see the same faces. My grades were not even close to how I wanted them to be. I assumed that it was ok, since it was my first semester. 
   When I went home for winter break, I was simply fatter and had no good ethics. I decided that the second semester would be different. I definitely did not go out as much and drink as much as before, and I actually did my work, which resulted in amazing grades this semester. I think I was able to find my balance. 
   Now that I am going home in 3 days, I am getting sad. I am going to miss everyone that is here and just Binghamton. The freedom that I have here is great. Once I go home, it will go back to always having to check in with my parents and ensuring them that I am ok. Plus waking up for 8am bio for a month is not something I am looking foward to, there better be some hot guys in that class to keep me awake for 4 hours!!!
   So recently my friends have discovered mug night. That was a big mistake. Now I was all excited about taking home my mug as a souvenier, however that is not happening. It is due to Brian. One night he took me and my friend back to his fraternity house while we were obliterated. Now I ended up being left there alone and when I wanted to leave I forgot my mug, and I want it back!!! But otherwise mug night just consists of flip cup and hanging around with the second floor of Chenango.  
   Well the summer is only a few months and then I will be back here in Chenango. I am looking forward to going home and seeing everyone that I miss. What I love is everyone here lives so close to me, so I won't have to miss anyone too much. Plus being in my own bed and not having to share my bathroom with all these girls is a good thought. Well that is basically my freshman year........"

"event","I am procrastinating writing my bullshit multi paper so I am posting an entry.

So my life has been boring lately.

My break was awesome though, well needed. I got to go shopping a lot, in real stores, and see my PIA. We even bought matching white hats, yes we are gay like that. After we played baseball with mentally retarded kids, but for me it was more a game of tag because Jimmy thought it would be so funny to chase me around the field for an hour. I also got to see ELI which always makes me happy. And then finally I took my little sister for her first manicure ever, she was excited. The best had to be when I went to the beach and saw Mr. Moyal- my ex teacher.  He looked too good to be a teacher. Yea I have wanted him for too long now. And now I am back at Binghamton for the next three weeks. Tomorrow will be a good day since I can eat bread and other real food....

Saturday I am going to Seth's school for his 21st birthday. I am excited to see his frat house and hang out. And Sunday we are coming back here for  50 cent, haha. He will love that....

No Eli quote today:( sorry.....

That is all...."

"event","Mina insists on me writing in this tonight. 

Today was a long day. I had class all day, at least I got to see a hottie in class ;)

I can not wait to get home for the break. I get to be in my bed and my room and see my family, yes I love and miss them. And at home I get to have my passover dinners and see Stacie :)And I get to go shopping with my girl!

So Dan refuses to be called Danny for some reason, and is upset because I lost the key chain that  he spent good time making for me :( However, it is not my fault... 

Eli: yo I am a tough guy, I am almost a frat boy.... 
*sorry thats a contradiction
I love quoting Eli... 

FEEL BETTER P!!!!"

"event","So Mina made this little ""journal"" for me, even though I don't keep a journal. ""Well now you will Amy, now you will.""-Mina

What does quixotic mean??? 

Right now my hair looks so sexy in its side ponytail. 

My sexy Eliran just walked right outside my window! ;)

My life is boring right now, all I have been doing is my work haha, and that's about it. As Andrea says, ""Boys are swine."" Who says that!

Eli: let's do this the old fashioned Great Neck way and key the fuck out of his car.... real tough guys where I come from

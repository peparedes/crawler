"event","A fool is what I've been told.
Untolerable pain seeping with cold.
Words swimming through emptyness.
A tear and a meaningless kiss.
Love..Hatred..pain to numb.
Reality is washing over and finally has come.
Throwing all memories and knowledge away.
Not one..not any will be able to stay.
No more pleasure
Filling with pain. 
What has become
Has driven me insane.
Not believing my ignorance
With each touch and phony kiss.
Corrupted anger
Just at myself.
A toy that has been put back on the shelf.
Never again shall it be given away.
Unwanted, I know.
So I shall not stay."

"event","Ok well let's recap on what has happened in the past few days shall we? *gets all prepped and ready for a long tale to be told.....well maybe not THAT long* Anyways the other day I was completely screwed over and lied to by the guy that I told myself that I have loved for a long time. We were once together for almost a year and a half, but things got rocky. He came over one day, kissed me and told me that he loved me and that he would think about us getting back together and tell me on my birthday if it would happen or not. Because he didn't want a relationship right now. Three days later I found out that he ended up with the one girl I hate the most and would love to destroy or have my evil fun with, but I refuse to let it get to me that bad. Oh and she's fucking 13 by the way!!!!! Scream in disgust! She was the girl that told him that she had sexual fantasies about him while we were still going out!!!! I just hate him and will never speak to him again. Atleast for an extremely long time. I have completely erased him from everything I have. I don't want to remember the guy that said when he told me he loved me that he didn't mean it. He lied to me and I felt the most powerful pain that could ever consume a human soul that night when my friend told me the truth about everything. Thank you Noelle. Without you I would still be sitting here waiting like a fool for love that isn't even there. I rather be alone than be lied to. That bastard. HAHA Well anyways let's move on. That night that I found out about the lying asshole......while I was completely numb of all feelings my best friend Kay called me to give me some news. She called and I heard a laugh in the background and FUCK!!!! I realized that my ex Adam was out of jail!!!! I haven't seen him or heard from him in a lonnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggg time. I was so surprised......the look on my face was undescribable. Now every time that he calls me it's still a major shock to me to hear his voice on the other line. Last night though he called me and reminded me of this one time, a long time ago while we were going out, that we had this amazing moment. One of those moments that is rare and it's when your with one person that you care about and the rest of the world just seems to fade away. I've never ever had another moment like that and I just find it a little strange that it was Adam that I had that moment with. The thing is that right when everything faded away into black around us and we were just about to kiss. Everything just rushed back to an administrator splitting us up and telling us to keep it for afterschool. That wasn't fair!!!! We were both so pissed lol. Well anyways I don't have those feelings for him anymore, but I will always remember that time. Last night we actually had a great conversation. Usually....like right before he went back to jail he always seemed to know how to get under my skin, but lately he seems really cool. He's trying something new out and that's to act a little more mature, but it's Adam and I don't think that it will go far, but atleast he is trying. He also said that from now on he want's to be faithful to whoever he is with, now and in the future. I found out that the girl he is with now cheated on him while he was in jail. He doesn't know though atleast I think he doesn't know. Personally I thought that they broke up while he was in jail. I knew that she wouldn't just be all faithful to a guy that's in jail. No.....that's not her style. It kinda makes me feel bad for him though. He deserves to know. I mean whenever I was in the hospital and he cheated on me he atleast let me know afterwards. I was pissed, but I'm glad he told me. Kayla (his g/f) is just letting it go and trying to hide what she did. He said that they were probably just going to break up anyways, and that he was going to give it a little while first so that he is sure that is what he wants to do. That's so not like him and I think it's a razy ass change, but it's pretty fucking cool to me. Well I'm done with the whole Adam story and I still have more good news! HAHA I finally got my permit yesterday! I'm so proud.....I mean I failed the test 3 freaking times, but I don't care. Atleast I have it now! WOO HOO! Party time! *does a little dance* Well I am finally done with my book lol. More new will come fast I know. It's neverending in my life. Sadness, anger, happyness, pride and fear. It's all there just waiting to be revealed."

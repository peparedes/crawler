Saying I love you 
Is not the words I want to hear from you 
It's not that I want you 
Not to say, but if you only knew 
How easy it would be to show me how you feel 

More than words is all you have to do to make it real 
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me, yeah 
Cos I'd already know 

What would you do if my heart was torn in two 
More than words to show you feel 
That your love for me is real 
What would you say if I took those words away 
Then you couldn't make things new 
Just by saying I love you 

Now that I've tried to talk to you and make you understand 
All you have to do is close your eyes 
And just reach out your hand and touch me 
Hold me close don't ever let me go 

More than words is all i ever needed you to show 
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me, yeah 
Cos I'd already know 

More than words....

"event","i would have done this first entry yesterday, when it was acutally my birthday...but the site thing wasn't working, and it was late, and i needed sleep. and im not completely sure what to write, but my friends told me that livejournal is awesome...so here i am. but guess what? im 18 now! ha! yeah, so i decided that i wanted to hang out with joe (boyfriend) instead of going out with my parents.  they want to take me out later on in the week...maybe this weekend.  i went to the one acts at school...and they were awesome.  made my birthday super cool.  and i got totally cool presents too!! julie b made me brownies, mike gave me a guns 'n roses cd, joe gave me a bunny, brian made me cookies & drew me a picture of a dragon which was totally awesome as well....then the rents bought me a keyboard.  i was super excited.  although im not supposed to tell anyone about it...oh well. haha
today after school, i had to rush to DMV becuase my appointment was at 2:50...and we got out of school at 2:15 today...later than most fridays.  and it only took 15 minutes to get a temporary license and a new picture! i was so excited.  i still haven't gotten my wallet back though.  it pisses me off.  i don't know what someone will do with a drivers license with MY picture on it....my atm card...which requires a pin and that i cacelled last week....and tons of my senior portraits and winter formal pics.  if i find out who did it...oh boy, they better watch out!
tonight though, im going to ""the thing"" at school.  pat is comming to pick me up later on, maybe 5 ish...and i don't think we have to be there till later, but im always confused about the time ""the thing is"". oh well...  :)"

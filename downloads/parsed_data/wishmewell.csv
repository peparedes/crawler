Hi Everyone,
 
My name is Katherine Grace Neeley and I came to live in Dallas, Texas on March 10, 2007.
I weigh 7 lbs. 12 oz. and am 18 inches long.  I am sending you some pictures of me, my Nana and me, my Auntie and me, my Mommy and Daddy and me, and more of just me.  Suffice it to say, it's all about me. 
 
But enough about me.  Hope this finds you all well and I can't wait 'til you can meet me for real!  Oops that was about me again wasn't it?  
 
Love,
 
Miss Kitty"

Quit being a fucking creeper and stop trying to get ahold of me.
As if deleting and blocking you from everything including my phone book wasnt a hint that I dont want to talk to you... now you are going to leave me anonymous messages on live journal, call my phone, and hang out at coney's 2 blocks from my house and send me messages telling me your gonna be there when there are like 5 other places you could go to do your homework at 3am at night ALOT closer to your apartment...  

Now onto the phone company... this is stupid.

Hopefully it will fade in time.

"event","Lyrics Lyrics Lyrics...
It's just... nicer than anything I could write right now...

I'm no Barbie doll
I'm not your baby girl
I've done ugly things and I have made mistakes
And I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines
And I am rotten to my core if they're to be believed
So what if I'm no baby bird hanging upon your every word?
Nothing ever smells of roses if it rises out of mud

Why do you love me
Why do you love me
Why do you love me it's driving me crazy
Why do you love me
Why do you love me
Why do you love me
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me
why do you love me

You're not some little boy
Why you acting so surprised?
You're sick of all the rules
Well I'm sick of all your lies
Now I've held back a wealth of s**t I think I'm gonna choke
I'm standing in the shadows with the words stuck in my throat
Does it really come as a surprise when I tell you I don't feel good?
That nothing ever came from nothing, man
Oh man ain't that the truth

Why do you love me
Why do you love me
Why do you love me it's driving me crazy
Why do you love me
Why do you love me
Why do you love me it's driving me crazy
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up ........ and I do it again

And you've still got the most beautiful face
It just makes me sad most of the time...

"event","I know i'm gettin older and should already understand all this by now but there are always a number of things that leave me questioning...
For instance-
Do guys just not give a fuck?
Do they all just have black crystal where their beating hearts should be?
After age 10 do they loose control completely of anything that might bring out some emotion to the world. Insted do you grab onto whatever else comes along that you can control to make yourself feel like your back in control? Well... WE ARE NOT YOUR EMOTION, PLEASE FIND YOUR OWN AND USE IT TO MAKE HOLE SOME DECISIONS.
Do they just turn into giant cement walls?
Whats the point of living if your only gonna show an inch of who u really are?
For those guys who complain about not getting a girls or who do but cant keep them,
Then go messing with girls minds like they are the funnest toys you could ever find to play with need to just go away, you should all be shipped to a deserted island (better yet, why not iraq) where you could all fuck each other mentally day and night till the day you die, and I sweare you would all die perfectly happy. Your all to shrot sighted and vane to see that their is so much more to life than... feeding your sad pathetic ego's."

Three words that just might have come too soon
Three hours from somewhere
I might have ended up with you

Hold me like a river
Hold me like a string tied to a balloon
You get what you're given
At any moment a moment of truth

All my life I'm traveling light
Been living in a sky
I'll float I'll fade I'll carry away
Til you pull me down and think of me sometimes

I'm sorry for leaving
I'm sorry for all I could not do
You knew it was coming
Maybe in some ways I did too

The keys by the bedside
And bags in the hall

Focus on the galaxy
Sweep away your expectations
and recognise your enemies

I hear you talking to yourself
You're stripping off for someone else
You've got to learn to love yourself
It's all that counts, there's little else

You're always looking for affections
and all its possibilities
Your senses searching for attention
in urgent need of gravity

I think you think you're someone else
You've got to learn to save yourself
Before you find there's nothing left
But bitterness
And hollowness
And afterglow

The little baby of whom we all grew to love after my last post, was found dead today. 
Investigators (Jerry Funk & Myself) say the death was slow and very unfortunate.
Most would have guessed it's death to be a horrid gorey death brought on by the 40lb, Russian Blue/Korat, Misty.
Though this was definitly not the case today in the Funk household. 
Witness (me) was taking on her nightly routine in the bathroom when walking over to the toilet caught a glimps of what was Cute Little Squirrely Squirrels. ""I found him drowned floating in the toilet, eyes half shut. If only I could have been there to come to it's rescue."" 

Tonight there is silence within the walls where the family of Cute Little Squirrelly Squrirrels lies.
""Surely his family must have heard his screams as the tragity was taking place."" Says Mr. Funk.

Tonight before I go rest I would like to say thank you to Cute Little Squirrelly Squirrels for the great times we shared and I hope you rest in peace in the afterlife and or are reborn into another fantastic squirrelly squirrel life where acorns grow a plenty on trees. Make sure if your able to, watch over your family and help guide them to great squirrelly bliss in their lifetime.
You will be miss much by all Cute Little Squirrelly Squirrels. 

In Loving Memory Of Cute Little Squirrelly Squirrels...

"event","Yup there is a family of squirrels living in my wall... and somehow one of them has been getting through the walls into the house. heres a picture of this distructive creature.
2 victums (Mr.Funk as well as Wanda) of the squirrel's wild nature have both experianced the baby Jumping out at them out of nowhere from somewhere high up. 
My interview with Mr. Funk went something like this... 
""I had just woke up and got my morning cup of coffee. I took a few sips relising like I do everymorning that the coffee is too hot to drink right away so I headed to my bedroom setting the cup of coffee on the dresser. I had a dance that evening, so I opend up my closet to get my dresspants out when that little shit jumped outta somewhere in my closet landing stright onto my head! Just when I think its gone... it pops out of somewhere else.""

Here are some pictures I captured from my incounter with the seemingly harmless but extreemly distructive baby squirrel.

"event","I thought that I could swim through the air yesterday so I jumped off a parking structure on 5th ave. 
When I descended grimly glancing at the concrete, my final resting place I realized wide eyed and feeling quite wise why my mind always spat out lies... Somberly I finalized that lies are a figment or fragment of the time, only you can specialize in the pieces depicted in the making of matter.
Why do I bother... I wonder.
Sleeping blindly under the future poster child who'll take his last breath. 
Hammering in bits of my future.
I see no brotherhood in this light.
Fight to Live. LIve tO Dide. 
Underneath this scar from above.
In a fairytale where sleeping beauty never wakes up.
Im a bit frightful of things that can be delightful.
""Its only in (death/life) I find the will to live through the night.""
Take your pick...



uh huh... I dont know. Hi im still alive, been working on finding my place. Got a new job at Petco at 15mile and coolege. Its fun when im not on register I get to play with ferrets. They make me happy. I'd buy one but im afraid my cat would take it upon herself to maliciously rip them apart. So I feel they are safer in their wonderful petco environment. mmmhmm. Other than that i've been sitting at home a lot as of lately due to the sudden lack of communication... If you have been trying to get a hold of me you would be curious as to what the fuck is up... well. my phone broke in half. So its temporally out of service if you would like the number to get ahold of me at... IM me or leave me a comment. Yea done talking like that. I feel so disconnected without my phone... I realize now how much I neglected having the opportunity to have access to everyone at the push of a button. Wow anyways its light out... Fuckin up my sleep schedule... im gonna hate myself in a couple days...

Your birth on the 27th day of the month (9 energy) adds a tone of selflessness and humanitarianism to your life path. 

Certainly, you are one who can work very well with people, but at the same time you need a good bit of time to be by yourself to rest and meditate. 

There is a very humanistic and philanthropic approach in most of things that you do. 



This birthday helps you be broadminded, tolerant, generous and very cooperative. 

You are the type of person who uses persuasion rather than force to achieve your ends.

You tend to be very sensitive to others' needs and feelings, and you able to give much in the way of friendship without expecting a lot in return.</td>

they come out at night
to dance and sing in the cool blue moonlight
casting shadows on the wall
hearing their voices and strange calls
creeping around there soon to see me
sitting there calmly like a curious baby
they can only eat me from the inside out
so i choose to sit and watch insted of shout
No harm can be done as well as im aware
of there concious thoughs of my intense stare
they continue dancing, untill they reach their high

Nothing to kill or die for,
No religion too,
Imagine all the people

I hope some day you'll join us,

You dislike conflict, and you've been able to rise above the angst of the world.
And when things don't go your way, you know they'll blow over quickly.

Easygoing, you tend to find joy from the simple things in life.
You roll with the punches, and as a result, your life is light and cheerful.

You find it easy to adapt to most situations, and you're an open person.
With you, what you see is what you get... and people love that!

Your vivid emotions and imagination takes you awy from this world
So much so that you tend to live in your head most of the time
You have great dreams and ambitions that could be the envy of all...
But for you, following through with your dreams is a bit difficult

You are charming, endearing, and people tend to love you.
Forgiving and tolerant, you see the world through rose colored glasses.
Underneath it all, you have a ton of passion that you hide from others.
Always hopeful, you tend to expect positive outcomes in your life.

in Contradiction. Controversial, unpredictable, and<br>never what anyone expects.
You appearance and your personality are two<br>opposite things. Even your
appearance sends different signals to different<br>people. To some you may look
innocent and sweet, to others you look mysterious<br>and intimidating at the same
time. No one ever knows what to expect with you.<br>You are a little bit of
everything all mixed together. You can be watching<br>the football game with the
guys one minute and the next out shopping at the<br>mall. You seem to be almost a
different person every time you meet someone, but<br>at the same time you know
exactly who you are and there is always that one<br>thing that makes you you. You
enjoy keeping people guessing and people love how<br>completely unpredictable you
are.</p>

You still don't know what to think of me
You still don't know what you think of me

Now that you know what you know
I bet you wish you could let it go
You'll never come sucking your thumb
Better off dumb

Now that you know what you know
You're going to reap what you sow
Nothing will come sucking your thumb
Better off dumb

You still don't know what you think of me
You still don't know what you mean to me
You still don't know what to think of me

You still don't know what you think of me X5

You still don't know what I think of you
You still don't know what you think of me</small>"

I feel broken...

twisting turning
fall*ing burning
rebirth is calling
~
fuck this revolving
trying to step outside 
this dimension of time
untie this doubt left inside



I need this venture..."

I just need time to collect and quiet all these thoughts...
I need time to focus...
Or else i will end up walking in circles...
walking down these same pathes learning the same lessons over and over again...
i cant and wont let that happen...
thats not me.
i will not be.
just another pea.
in the pod.

Don't forget your roots
Don't forget your roots
Don't forget your roots

I was thinking about the good old times
And all the people who helped me survive
Now who the hell knows where I'd be
Without the branches of my family tree

I was thinking about the friends who cared
And all the times that we shared
And if I had the strength to be what I could be
Love and respect to the branches of my tree

Family Tree!!

Roots
Don't forget your roots
Don't forget your roots
Don't forget your roots

dont forget the struggle, 
dont foget the streets, 
dont forget your roots, 
and dont sell out!</i>

""Beautiful""
Beautiful, you're beautiful, as beautiful as the sun
Wonderful, you're wonderful, as wonderful as they come
And I can't help but feel attached
To the feelings I can't even match
With my face pressed up to the glass, wanting you
Beautiful, you're beautiful, as beautiful as the sky
Wonderful, it's wonderful, to know that you're just like I
And I'm sure you know me well, as I'm sure you don't
But you just can't tell
Who'll you love and who you won't
And I love you, as you love me
So let the clouds roll by your face
We'll let the world spin on to another place
We'll climb the tallest tree above it all
To look down on you and me and them
And I'm sure you know me well, as I'm sure you don't
But you just can't tell, who you'll love and who you won't
Don't let your life wrap up around you
Don't forget to call, whenever
I'll be here just waiting for you
I'll be under your stars forever
Neither here nor there just right beside you
I'll be under the stairs forever
Neither here nor there just right beside you 

""M&M""
Growing up full of apologies
Spent all my
time trying to be me
We all know it's never really easy
At least I know I can admit it

You need to remember, you need time to forget
We need the time to change our minds
And separate the present from tomorrow
Disguised as yesterday

Time moves so slow, but change comes too fast
On top of the world, how could it last?
So many hands to shake, never give you a break
They think you have it all
But where are those hands when you're falling

I remember how it used to be
Things were great, why did they change
You need time to remember, you need time to forgive
We needed time to make our mind
And try to change the present for tomorrow
Because of yesterday"

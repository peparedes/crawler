The weather was so nice yesterday...sunny and 82....and today it is 60 and cloudy...YUK! I just wish summer would come and STAY! I have done a lot of work on the landscaping around the house this spring.....we put out reddish colored brick border around the front and both sides of the house and I planted a ton of perrinials (so I don't have to do it again next year). Angie gave me a few of her starts ,too. Tom and I painted the porch, and I touched up painted the whole house (the part I could reach anyway!). We had new gutters put on....it is about time too, as I think the old ones were over 50 years old! We got mulch last weekend and it looks great! I bought that pretty red floral swing at Wal Mart and it is in the backyard, but I hardly ever have time to sit down in it! 

Nate has been in track, and although he didn't do well running the mile, he DID excel at Longjump. He even got picked to go to an Invitational in Shawnee last weekend. He is not bad for just starting it a few weeks ago. I am sure he will be really good at it next spring. Nate is also a straight A student and I am very proud!

Erika has her dance recital coming up. Tom and I went to observation night at her dance place Monday night and they showed us their routine for the recital, which is the beginning of June. They were really good! She is doing great in school,too....getting all A's and B's!

Brittni is joining student council next fall. I told her she better start joining more clubs to get better scholorships for college. She also won $150 for a drawing she did for the VFW, and we all got to go to a special banquet to watch her receive her money and an award! She had many pieces of art in the art show at the high school and they were all excellent! She,too, is a straight A student...how did I get all of these smart kids??!!

Sam is about to ""graduate"" from Preschool. He has gone on many field trips lately...to East Of Chicago Pizza, to the kindergarten, to the Garden Emporium, etc. He passed his kindergarten screening in the EXCELLENT range....another smart kid! He loves to play in the yard with the neighbor kids, especially Dillon Robbins who I have been babysitting for. He will be turning 6 in a few weeks and he and his friends are going to celebrate with a bowling party!

Tom got a new position at Crown. He is a team leader now and doesn't have to bust his butt out on the line anymore. He just runs himself ragged fixing everybody elses problems now!

We got a HUGE Super Wal Mart in Celina this week and it is the BOMB! I spent 3 hours there yesterday and I am getting ready to take Dillon, Sam and Ashley again today to check out the toy department. 

Well, I guess that about wraps it all up. I suppose I will type a bit more in another month or two....I want to ask all of you to please keep in touch, and tell you that I am sorry for not being a better friend and picking up the phone once in awhile to call you. I miss you all and hope to hear from you soon!!!!!"

"event","My how the weather changes so quickly for good to BAD....very very bad! There is 2 inches of snow on the ground and it is still falling! I had to go out to the porch and shake the snow off of the soaking wet sheet that was covering my poor impatients (that I planted WAY too early!) I just went and put a big sheet of plastic over them, then a dry sheet. I wonder if they will make  it....I sure hope they do. They were quite costly!

We are going to go to wapak to church this morning, a baptist church, to see our niece, Kaitlin, get dedicated (Jeremy and Julie's baby). Then we are going to go to their house for lunch.

The kids are at their ""other parents"" and will be coming home later. Nate has a track meet tomorrow....oh that will be a fun one to sit thru! Maybe the snow will at least be gone by then. 

Hey, if anybody is actually reading this, reply once in awhile so I know someone is out there!LOL"

"event","Wow! the weather is sooooo nice today and yesterday! Spring is here.....finally! It was so nice to go out into the yard and visit with all the neighbors that I hadn't seen all winter, like Andrea and Lisa.  Dillon fell off of the swing yesterday and hit the concrete and gashed open his chin....another Robbins kid permantely scarred at my house! I didn't think it needed stitches and I got it to stop bleeding quickly, so I just slapped a band-aid on it and told Traci about it when she got here. It is fine today. The boys have preschool today so I am going to run a large box of clothes to the consignment shop in Coldwater to make some money. Brittni needs ALL new summer shorts this year, and I know how expensive her taste is! Nate had his first track meet yesterday and we all went to watch him run the mile event. He beat his own time, but came in last. My heart went out to him and I came home and cried because I know how bad he must have felt. But he has awesome coaches, and they must have encouraged him, and he still wants to do that event and he still wants to run. He doesn't have to be the best for me think he is anyway. I am so proud of him just the way he is! 

Have a great day, friends!"

"event","Today is a rainy yucky day so I am going to cheer it up a bit by going to the mall! I worked hard in the yard yesterday so I deserve a little break! I laid out 7 stepping stones iin the front yard, from the driveway to the sidewalk leading to the house. I was tired of slipping and sinking in the mud there because the yard is so low there. I did a fine job if I must say so myself. I followed directions that I found on the Lowe's web site. My next project is to paint the porch and the front stairs, then build a brick platform to set my new swing on in the backyard. I also plan to touch up paint the house and work on my crummy landscaping. But no today...too rainy. 
My kids went to their dads, Sam is at his mom's, and Erika is over at Amber's. So Tom and I had a day to sleep in and I slept till 6:59. I had to sleep in brittni's bed because of Tom's snoring. The night before that I slept in Sam's bad. Tonight HE has to go somewhere else because I miss my bed! 
My car is getting re-fixed right now because the brakes squeaked really bad after they put new ones on and they better not charge me for re-fixing it. It was expensive enough the first time. I have a really bad broken thing in the engine that is going to cost over 400 to have fixed. Figures, that as soon as I get it paid off the dumb thing breaks down.....

Anyhow, I am off to eat some breakfast!"

Had a great weekend in Columbus with my friends Jon, Cindy, Heather and Chris. We went out to eat at two cool restaurants (PF Chang and Mongolian BBQ) and also went to the Funny Bone Comedy Club and saw a great show. Heather < Chris, Tom and I shared a real nice hotel room, and we all did some shopping as well. Mother Nature did NOT cooperate with us, but we had fun anyway. 

Tom and I bought a brown leather recliner from Lazarus that will be delivered on Saturday. It is so soft and feels so good that I am sure there will be a line to sit in it."

The weather has made a turn for the better this week and I was able to work outside most of the day, picking up trash and sticks out of the yard and scooping up dog poop, etc. Sam and Iassc and Ashley played outside most of the day too. I took Sam to the dr this morning to have the wax irrigated out of both of his ears because he flunked his hearing test at preschool. It took forever, but he did gerat and I took him to Burger King because he was so good. he had huge chunks of wax in there.....it was amazing that he was able to hear anything at all! I went to Coldwater tonight ans saw Susan amd Matt. Matt was diagnosed with cancer on his windpipe in Jan and is undergoing chemo, and then radiation. God bless them, they just got married in July and then this! He is doing very well with the treatments and the cancer is shrinking. Please keep Matt Korneger in your prayers..... Survivor wasn't on tonight, which is a good thing because I had to help Erika study for a test anyway. All of the kids are going off in different directions this weekend so Tom and I can spend some time with our friends. Jon , Cindy, heather, Chris and Tom and I are all going to Columbus to Easton to the comedy club and out to eat. i am so looking foward to the weekend!!

I start babysitting Dillon on Monday full time....I pray that he is good for me. he is a hard kid to watch....."

Sam went to his mom's for the weekend. Nate and I spent some quality time together and went out to Wendy's for a Frosty then played one game of bowling....which we both stunk at! I tried to watch a scary movie called Grudge with Tom but he fell asleep at 8:00 and was snoring so badly that I had to go finish it in another room! We all need to get up fairly early tomorrow because we are going to go to Lima with the confirmation calss to have a thingy on Mission work. I think we will be visiting a homeless shelter. Brittni will stay home alone and go against her grounding and be on the computer all day! Oh, yes! I remember those days of sneaking around your punishment!LOL

Did quite a bit of sewing today and had some good tippers too! Went to Wal Mart today and got a really snazzy pair of white dress pants and some really nice dressy slides that look like Cinderella slippers. My kids are all running amuck in here and making a ton of noise and I am ready for them to go to bed so I can enjoy my 2 hours of quiet! I watched Dillon today and boy, is he a live wire! He about wears me out! I get my Grandbabies for a few hours on thursday. I haven't seen them in a couple of weeks and I am looking foward to it. We finally closed on our house and paid off the van. Only 16 more years and this little old shack is all mine!LOL Rick saved us a lot of money, so if anybody is interested in refinancing or consolidating any debt, let me know and I will hook you up with him. Jon and Cindy are still in Tahiti.....must be nice! It is 85 and sunny every day there!!! NO FAIR! It was semi nice out today, but the high temp for tomorrow is 23 and snow is likely....bummer. I am all ready for this winter to end. I scoped out a new swing for my backyard reading pleasure already at Wal Mart and I think I will be the first to buy it and bundle up and read a book. Call me crazy, but that is like on of my favorite things to do! Just finished a good book called Night Swimming. It was really entertaining and a real feel good book. I am now off to do laundry and see whats good on tv tonight!"

The reception willl be a blast, with all of our old gang together one more time. Tom is getting ready for hsi share group and hogging the bathroom. Kraig and Becky Macwhinney are picking me up in a couple hours. That's about how long it will take me to shave these hairy legs....ha ha!
I sure hope Heather makes ity today. I miss her, and this would be a perfect opportunity for us to catch up on things. My kids are at their dads and Sam is at his moms and Erika stayed at Amber's last night. She will work on a bunch of schoolwrok today while we are at the wedding, then go to Holly's to stay the night. Tom and Scott McCune will ride to the wedding together. My dog will be left her for too many hours alone and will probably pee all over the place.  Hey! Guess who came over with a huge summer sausage and to see Tom? Andy Jaeger! He wanted to apologize to him. It had to be a very hard thing for him to do, and Tom said he had tears in his eyes, but it was nice for him to come over and do it, whether his mom and and da made him do it or not. Angie and I also had a long talk, and things are good between all of us once again.

Of course, she would end up with the English teacher who assigns the most work....two big projects at once. And guess who ends up doing most of the work for her. I would loive to just let her try to do it on her own, but she would flunk and I can't have that. I hate her ADD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish there was something better than that pill she is on, because sometimes I think it is useless. Brittni and I typed about 8 pages for her tonight, and that was only a small part of her project. It is insane all that she has to do and i feel sorry for her. Nate doesn't have half the work she has! And then we went over and over and over her vocab with her and she just couldn't remember any of them. What are we to do??? Any suggestions???? I will take all advise!!

Had to get my car fixed....it was so costly that I could only pay for a small part of it. They will have to fix the rest in a few weeks when I find more money....all in all it will cost about $700!

I took Erika and Amber to a scrapbooking birthday party yesterday afternoon and I spent 2 hours at Kmart until the party was over! I went up and down every aisle and hit some pretty good blue light specials. I have never been in Kmart for so long! The girls had a good time. They had gone to church camp with this girl and it was nice of her to invite them. The youth counselor at our church told me yesterday that the kids have to go to a meeting Wednesday at 8:30pm(when she KNOWS my kids are at youth group in St Marys) about Lakeside, the church camp that I wanted to send them to this summer. Well, I have never heard of having to attend meetings to go to church camp! If this is the case, I will have to find another place to send them. That is just wrong, and if that is the case, that is just one more reason why I DON'T bring my kids to youth group at my church.....

I am SO looking foward to that wedding.....free food, drinks, fun, etc! My bridesmaids dress is beautiful and I actually had to alter it and make it smaller since I have lost 12 pounds on this ""wedding diet""! Heather says she is not going to go and I think she should. It will be one last time for us to all party together as a group like old times. I sure hope Braden drives up for the event. It will be a blast! Only a week and a half now!  Tom and Mike talked tonight and things went well. He understands that his son did a bad thing and should be punished.   Please keep my dad in your prayers.

We got Sam's hair cut at a new place today and they buzzed the kid....SHORT! His mom will totally hate it, but I like it. he is a doll! It was cheap for a haircut too....only$6! Unfortunately adult cuts are $18!!! What a rip-off....

Took Sam to school then ran some errands and laid in the tanning bed (again....what a charmed life!). Tom made pork chops for dinner but I didn't eat a whole lot because my share partner, Jan and I went to the Empire for a yummy dessert! I really enjoyed talking to her....she is a great friend and I am so glad we have our own little share group. It is nice to get out of the house with a friend even if it is only for an hour. I think we will do it again next week.

Anybody know any way we can raise $50,000 for the new tennis courts in Celina???

Christian music has come a LONG way, and you can't even tell that it is Christian music....it's not all like hymnal churchy music.....Its really cool and I like the fact that my kids can listen to todays hip-hop rap stuff that they like, but I know that it is Christian so I don't have to worry about the words being bad.

The house was covered in silly string when I pulled up tonight. I figured the neighbor we busted was pissed and silly stringed us! Found out it was only Sam, but he is still going to have to scrub it off the sdide of the house tomorrow. What a mess!!!

Good night, my friends!"

"event","Saturday was a good day. I got my hair cut early in the day, then went shopping by myself in Lima, one of my favorite pasttimes! I bought Tom a really nice suit at Value City for $39! What a deal! The pants were as tall as me! Thank goodness I know how to sew! I also got some good deals at Kohl's for Sam. Of course I had to buy myself something! I got a neat pair of jeans at Old Navy.

Tom made chili for the kids and himself (I passed!) and I went over to Sherry Lovitt's and watched Ella for her, who hates me and cried the entire time! Than Amber, Erika, Tom and I went to see The King and I in Van Wert. It was a fun evening.

Brittni got back from the 36 hour famine at the purple door church and I later dropped her off at a friends, that child is never home! Nate had Adam over so he didn't have to be alone in the house since we now live in a ""bad neighborhood"". Its a shame that I had to tell him to keep the doors locked and not answer the phone.

We are all off to church now since we will miss it on Wednesday. Brittni is going skiing in Bellefontaine today and I have volunteered to drive the youth group there. Erika is grounded for not doing her chopres yesterday, and Tom and Nate will be glued to the TV all day more than likely."

"event","Just went to the bone cruncher....man, do I feel like a new woman!! Because of my 4 hip surgeries in my youth, my left leg is 1 inch shorter than my right....thus, the lower back problems. I was going to have Tom take me out to eat in Lima at the Olive Garden tonight for Valentine's Day, but I had to pay the chiropractor $40 so now no meal. Darnit. Oh well, it is a relief to be able to walk and move without pain.

No word from the police about what went on down there after they nabbed the bad boys yesterday. Angie just spoke to me kindly and offered to pick Ashley and Sam up from school, so she must not hate me, thank God. 

I watched my two grandchildren Jacob (8 months) and Sydney (5 years) today. Jacob is spolied rotten and cries every time you put him down! Syd is a perfect angel. I can't wait for Jacob to get out of this whiny baby stage. I prefer watching older children! It was fun anyway. I would attach some pics, but I obviously don't know how yet. Britt will help me later since she practically lives on the computer.

Sam is the only one leaving this weekend. My kids traded weekends with their dad this weekend so Brittni can go skiing Sunday with her youth group from St Mary's. I have volunteered to drive them there Sunday. I will enjoy sitting by the fire in the lodge reading my book for 8 hours!"

"event","They caught the bad guys at the music store today, just like we figured they would. Tom was there and busted the kid himself. It's a long story, but it ended good. They took the kid away in handcuffs, then came to get my neighbor who was his accomplice. It is a shame what drugs will do to kids. I just hope this doesn't ruin my friendship with his mom.....

Anyhow, thanks for your prayers! God is good.....the bad guys didn't get away with it this time!

check out my pics!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","Hi friends! Today the kids finally went to school on time....no fog delays.....no snow delays.....YIPPIE! It is just Sam and I and things are quiet! Mom is coming over later so I can run to the grocery and to the police department. While we worshipped as a family in church last night, some punk decided to break into our home and steal 54 of Tom's CD's. I am to bring a list of some of the stolen CD's to the police and also to the Music Store in case the punk is going to try to sell them for money for drugs. I know who did it, but I am a Christian and his mom is one of my best friends and I can't point fingers unless we have proof. It is frustrating. The kid used to be so nice.  I thank God every day for giving me 4 kids that I can be proud of. I am very blessed..... I have to go pay the lawyer as well. We had Sam's last name officially changed to Smith last week. YEA! Pray for a big lump sum of money to fall into our laps this week. We are going to owe the IRS a HUGE amount of money on a CHILD SUPPORT payment we received from Sam's mom last year. Now is that FAIR? I am very upset about this, but crying and worrying is not going to make it go away....Well, I must go shower. Hope you enjoyed my first entry! I told you I had an exciting life, didn't I??LOL"

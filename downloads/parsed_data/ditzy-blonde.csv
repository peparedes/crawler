it's like nothing you have ever lived for even exists anymore.
you had something so close to you and you left it, you forgot to hold it close to you, so close that nothing else mattered... but it all matters now.
you let go... why? torn apart from what? is it fear?

i let it go... and it feels like forever since it was last in my thoughts, and it has now returned...

got to see moneen last night awesome show. and kenny hung out with me for like 20 minutes before he left

a lot of people don't like moneen anymore, but they still have to be one of my favourites. no matter what anybody says

so buying the ticket for $32 i figured moneen will probably see $2 of that money

so i spent WAY to much on merchandise.... really hot stuff though (oh yeah...)

got my new tattoo goes from my left to right kidney and from my neck to just below my ass crack... it's effin HUGE ""ba da ba ba ba i'm lovin it...""    okay, never again...

warped tour was amazing, atreyu's pit was the best i've ever been in, and they were awesome, though some people need to realize that they are not gods, just merely humans with talent that have gotten somewhere, i mean, idolizing them is ok.  but once again, only human. and moneen's coming to guelph in september, to the denim, with rufio... and.... i forget who else...

offspring was quite cocky, but still good, and they kind of have a right to be cocky, in some form i suppose.  and avenge 7 fold was effin amaing, i didn't realize how incredibly good they were, transplants were good too!

no more bartending for me....
                                       (go jes go)
but the fact that i was quitting made me so happy
and yes, this may sound conceded and ocky...
but i haven't been happy for weeks, and today i was so happy that i quit, that when i went to the bathroom, i looked in the mirror, and i thought i looked pretty....
like i didn't care what anyone else thought....
i thought i looked pretty darn good...
lol
ya, realy cocky
but i feel relaxed and at ease....
if i could feel like this for the rest of my life...
then rock on 
anywho
night all

"event","i feel very lugubrious...
feeling unworthy and unwanted again...
why?
i have friends, i have family and yet i still feel not good enough
i feel reprehensible, unbecoming... (says the selfish child)
what is to become of me
i'm really annoying myself by being depressed, is that possible?

i'm smiling on the outside
but something is just not right
something i cannot put my finger on...

meh, it's probably just a phase that i'm passing through
it'll probably be gone in a couple of days
so, work was... ya
well work sucked as always... heh
ya, ok, i feel like ass....

ummm, nothing to talk about so bored

i think i might buy a life soon
i mean, i hear they're pretty cheap at Sally Anne's (Salvation Army)
any one else need one while i'm there?

the lifeless girl is off again...

"event","so i fell asleep pretty early last night.... quite happy, but then 5:30 rolls around and i'm having an odd dream i can only remember pieces of it, and there was this huge noise in my dream, like cats fighting.
surely enough i woke up and my cats are fighting, tsk tsk...
it's cool, how noises and objects can just roll themselves into the dream.... heh roll?, nice use of the vocabulary!
ya...i really don't want to work....
it's going to blow, but i guess i have to do what i have to do!
i'm going to have a nice hot shower.....
and then work... then ya...
oh man
the people upstairs are playing music so loud the bass is shaking the dishes... 99 red ballons... lol
i believe the blink version (is that who covered it?)
aw... geeze it woke my mom up and now she's in a bad mood.... growl....
hmm, now other stuff, not sure whom it is
sp yesterday i was on a swing, and and something made me look behind me on myself, and it was a spider, so i did my little eek jump thing and tried to flick it off, though with my master in hand eye coordination i missed and flicked the seat
well, good news, i found a bruise on my nail/fingertip and 2 spider bites... could it have been maybe i was bitten an only subconsciously noticed?, ok this is just rambling, so.......


ok, shower time....
alrighty then

peace

"event","long time no... type?
i'm in one of those moods
you know
where you don't want to be here or there, happy or sad, alive or dead
it's just bleh
you feel like you're trying so hard but nothing is appreciated or accomplished
and the agony of it just destroys you
you contemplate your emotions to try and figure which one is the right one...
but you know, you'll never find it
and maybe you don't want to
but either way you've got to go on

you work 60 hours a week, and have no money
you find no one and you never feel as though you deserve it when you do

i think i'm becoming pickier and pickier, b/c whenever i think i find someone, i'm always wrong

i haven't been the best of friends to my 3 * gang
i should be hanging out with you all more,
but all i ever do is work sleep and eat
i've become so attached to these customs that if i did get the chance to go out, i don't know if i would....
but i want to
so i think i shall call my 3* star girls to go out
trappers maybe... underground?

ya
though i miss you all dearly

"event","hey all my boys... and uh... girl (mo?)
so, i went in for surgery,and ow
does it ever hurt, so if any one is going out for surgery, i definately do not recommend it!
they were supposed to fixed my endometriosis, (which they did) and my complex cyst, but for some reason the cut is on the other side of my stomach hmmmm
and i think they messed but, they were only supposed to cut me in 2 spots, maybe 3, but i think they accidentally started cutting beneath my belly button (he he?)
ya, so i was drugged and cut, heh
i miss eveyone, especially my 3 * group
i'm sorry i haven't been around, i've turned into a hermit crab : (
i now work at tequila joes (the old cactus jacks) and ample annies, tj's bartending full days, and annies only wed and thurs waitressing
and yay, fancy the old valentines day coming around, i think i've only been in a relationship once on V-day
but meh what can you do, any who
i got out of the house a few sundays ago with the tj staff.....
and there was this cool girl named jessica, i ended up partying mainly with her all night long, and did we ever have a friggin blast.
so i'm happy i get to work with her, but she's leaving for a month ( stupid jerk... lol)
but oddly enough it happens to be nick weavers sister, haha
any who, she's one wild girl, lol......
she almost reminds me of michy
anywho, i'm off to check on my friends pro's... or at least who still has me on
haven't posted much
i think maybe after a week or so when i'm all healed, i might try to get out of the house,
so timmer... Mo you guys better give me a call or else i'm gonna be using the phonebook, lol
hope everyobne has a great day

"event","my computer decided to gain many viruses, it won't let me check my email, but it'll hopefully allow me to log in and enter this entry, 
it's taking a long time, well i miss everyone who comments on me, not many, but definately appreciate those who do, 
a lot has happened, saw my dad once, have to go in for surgery soon, might not be able to  have kids, but i don't know, i've kind of gotten over the main concern.
for the most part now i think my concern is my past, which is retarded
hmmm....
yeah, i'm not exactly in the most talkative mood today, , my dream with the cars is slowly diminishing, though i won't allow it to vanish
for now i'm a bartender, not exactly my dream, and not exactly my favourite occupation.
but i have a few hefty debts to pay off, 
hehe, this is real corny, i but this new deoderant, it's tropical breeze and my armpits smell so damn good
well i'm  off to clean
adios all"

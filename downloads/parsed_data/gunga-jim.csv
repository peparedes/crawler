I'm here to plug my show, Gunga's Drive-In, as seen on America's Most Wan....er...local cable access channel 7 here in Bloomington, Indiana. The web site is www.seriousweirdness.com and I'd love to have any and all visitors to the site.

I recently received promotional DVDs for the re-mix of Flash Gordon (1980 version) and hope to receive come of ""Serenity"" soon. The web site will have contests where you can win a sneak preview DVD, info on the show, drivel about drive-ins, horror movies, horror hosting, and web radio like cultradio-a-gogo.

"event","I thought I'd start off a new entry (first in a long time) with a few observations/beefs:

1. The Grand Canyon is awesome. The view of earth from the moon is awesome. The amount of money we've spent on Iraq is awesome. Your wife stopping off to by some bread on the way home is *NOT* awesome. The Post Office holding your mail until Tuesday is *NOT* awesome. I swear, if I hear ""awesome"" to describe the mundane just once more...it's lampshade time! Awesome!

2. If only slipping thorazine into my co-workers' drinks wasn't considered ""assault"" by the local fuzz.

3. My name is Gunga Jim and I'm a ""rage-a-holic""....YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?!?!?!

Moron these and other beefs later....GJ"

If gingerbread men live in gingerbread houses, isn't that like living in a house made of the same stuff as you? Wouldn't that be like living inside Oprah? Or maybe the family from Texas Chainsaw Massacre - armchairs made of arms, wallpaper and lampshades of human skin.....kinda like living with Iron Chef Gein.

"event","Been out of action for way too long with summer programs, vacation, oh..and..getting married. Yep. I decided 11 years between electroshock series was long enough and got hitched again. To the detriment of my drive-in TV show, web site, friendships, etc, I've been spending all my time on these.

But now....on to pillage--

I can't remember the last time I had this much fun. No, really. I can't remember a thing since I've been on my new meds. After having been around the world (Hong Kong Hilda knows what I mean by that *wink* *wink*), I've decided to spend more time on leisurely pursuits. Or was that ""leisure suits""? (see previous notation re: meds). Be sure and drop by the web site: www.seriousweirdness.com for more updates as they happen. I'll try to keep up regular entries (as opposed to the usual ""rear entries"" - ibid)."

"event","Hi there, fellow travelers! This is Gunga Jim coming to y'all live from somewhere high in the mountains of Sikkim (which looks oddly like Indiana, despite the assurances of my travel agent).

I thought I'd take a few minutes before I dive into the slavegirl pool here at Gunga's Ashram for the Mentally Unbalanced and introduce myself. My hobbies are drive-in movies (I host a local drive-in theater on TV), reading, cataloging crustaceans for Red Lobster, writing my name in the snow and working with video. My dislikes are rude people, Indiana drivers, and people who try to see how long it takes for someone's lips to quit moving after being decapitated.

My fondest memories are of going to the drive-in every weekend in summers and learning to be ""freewheelin'"" as opposed to freebasing. I am now the kind of guy that likes to ""let it all hang out."" Which is probably why I'm not allowed on city buses any more.

Anyway....I'll be hanging around here some and hope to run into many interesting characters (at about 70 mph).

Love, Kisses, and some viral DNA segments
Gunga Jim"

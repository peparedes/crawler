(In my area traffic jams are common so it happens a lot that i have to wait wich is no problem if they tell me)<br /><br />Well..........................two out of ten manage to call me and everything is fine.<br />From the remaining eight only 50% manage it to call and it goes like this:<br /><br />*ring*<br /><br />Me: Hello?<br /><br />Driver: HEY, i'm in front of your house, where the hell are you?!<br /><br />Me: Oh really?

"event","Hi everyone!<br /><br />Now is your chance to get off the waiting list. Today we have finally been able to complete our negotiations with the Golden Tulip Hotel in Suhl, and I think we've been able to come up with a very acceptable solution. We now have an extra 120 rooms available. The hotel is located in the city center of Suhl, which is less than a 10 minute drive. To make the extra distance bearable we will be offering a FREE 24h shuttle service between the two hotels. So even if you decide to check in at the overflow hotel, you will be able to get up and down the hill without an own car, rental or taxi. <br /><br />For details about the hotel, booking and tariff, please check out the new overflow hotel section of the EF webpage:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.eurofurence.org/EF14/cont-overflow.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.eurofurence.org/EF14/cont-overflow.html</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.eurofurence.org/EF14/gfx/gt-in1-big.jpg""><img width=""800"" height=""578"" alt="""" src=""http://www.eurofurence.org/EF14/gfx/gt-in1-big.jpg"" /></a>"

But we will take a break this year.

I will celebrate christmas just with my parents and a few friends of mine and on the second holiday we have a furry chistmas with all the local furs anyway.

French lesson one: Don't mix up ""merde"" and ""merci""

French lesson two: ""Un baguette por favor"" brings you no baguette but a confused salesmen.

French lesson three: Who knows how to tell the roommate if she please can stay out because i'm still in my bed?"

"event","I arrived in paris yesterday night at 2:00 pm together with BigBlueFox, TaniDaReal, Cheeath, o'wolf and Tioh.
We are representing Eurofurence at the arte tracks festival (arte is a frensh tv station.

You can find more details and fotos in BigblueFox lifeyournal  :)

I just want to mention our hotelroom wich is so small that you have to leave the room to change your mind as someone mentioned  ;)

But its still very nice, its clean and in a very nice part of the city, its all very artistic and free i really like it  :)

The first day was a great success but i'm totally exhausted now, luckily we can sleep till 12:00 tomorrow."

"event","Last weekend Thalian and Susanne came to my place for a private Fursuit Photoshoot.
Thalian is the official Eurofurence photographer and some of you might know him already.

It was so great, they did a wonderful job and took photos of Bentley, BigBlueFox, Savoy, Tani and Taibu.
They also brought some really nice props *wags*

I'll try to post some results as soon as possible.

And thanks again you two for the great weekend  :)"

She was like a second mother to me cause i spend a huge part of my childhood at her place when my parents were traveling.
I will remember her as the most lovely and caring person i ever know, she never got mad at me she never lost her patience.

Thank you for everything, i will never forget you."

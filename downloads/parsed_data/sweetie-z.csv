ive gotten about 5 or 6 comments as to why i switched and saying i should switch back to public...
see
the thing with friends only is that i know i wont get certain people who comment with crap, when if they only have crap to say then they shouldnt be reading my journal.
its nice to know that there are people out there who actually like reading my journal though :)

maybe ill switch on and off?

happy summer everyone!

i took my lj link off my profile. sometimes i feel like i am trying to promote myself to others. im really nto though. its to make people see who i am. hahaha wait a second- not gonna lie my lj doesnt reflect on who i am all the time...at all.

who am i anyway? its so weird thinking about all the different elements that make up one person. like ""oh thats such a zainub thing to do"" or ""oh thats such a zainub car"" (the convo ana and i were having yesterday and she picked out the UGLIEST OLD WOMAN cars possible and i was having a fit.) or ""oh thats such a zainub thing to wear""

The smile i fake - the permanent wave of
Cue cards and fix it kits

Lost in coffee rings - and fingerprints
I don't - wanna feel - anything

its amazing and i love it. probably better then norah jones, sarah mclachlan, coldplay, and at switchfoots level. i love it

you know how everyone has like ONE artist that they love and they relate to, and they just drown in? for sure they are it.

get breathe in by them. its vewwy good

i drive at 2:40 today- hopefully none of you will be on the road bc your too precious to die. haha ok that really wasnt funny, i really meant it but yeah im really...nervous.

driving is so weird and intimidating at first. i always step up to 50 and then realize so i look at the speed thingi and then yeah its not good. i tend to steer to the right right now bc i think its cuz of human nature, im afraid of on-coming traffic. what else...otherthen that my driving instructor said im pretty good. wahooooo...well there is the whole paralell parking issue...shhhh...haha

i hope you feel better ansa!

btw i saw garden state last night. possibly the best movie ive ever seen...its so moving and powerful. one of those movies you cant see more then 3 times bc it looses its beauty. natalie portmans character said something so moving- in the scene where they are in the bar and shes talking about her disease. 

mmm but only smart normal people can see it- no shallow stupid ditzes can. haha that was sort of mean but its true...

i need to dye my hair again...i dont even know if i can haha.

its by this guy named josh groban- celine dion discovered his talent...so obviously he has this amazing opera powerful beautiful voice. i know i may be made fun of for liking this, or called a wuss or a ""pussy"" but shut up because if you laugh at this then you have no sensitive side...
or maybe yeah.
Who can say for certain
Maybe you're still here
I feel you all around me
Your memory's so clear 

Deep in the stillness
I can hear you speak
You'r still an inspiration
Can it be 
That you are mine
Forever love 
And you are watching over me from up above 

Fly me up to where you are
Beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight 
To see you smile
If only for awhile
to know you're there
A breath away's not far
To where you are
Are you gently sleeping
Here inside my dreams
And isn't faith believing
All powers can't be seen
As my heart holds you
Just one beat away
I cherish all you gave me
Everyday
Cause you are mine
Forever love
Watching me from up above
And I believe 
That angels breathe
And that love will live on and never leave 

Fly me up to where you are
Beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight
To see you smile
If only for awhile
To know you're there
A breath away's not far
To where you are
I know you're there
A breath away's not far
To where you are.

she doesnt understand me at all. all she thinks about is everyone elses perspective. i work my fucking ass off sometimes and she doesnt even recognize it. yeah sure she says she does but i know she doesnt.
this may be self pity but this is an appropriate time to have it.
honestly fuck this. why am i even here. 
all of this makes no sense- nothing is right, nothing is good.
school sucks, i suck at school, i cant have the one thing that i want, the one thing that i want more then anything.
i dont even deserve anything i want.
so why am i even here i ask sometimes
what is this? its such a blur. what are my goals in life...to get good grades to get to a good college so i can make some good fucking money...
its all so fuckign superficial.
whats the fucking point?
am i even going to be here long enough to enjoy it?
life sometimes seems so pointless. when i want to do things and take responsibility theres one person or another making me feel guilty and fucked up.
ill never act like this- ever. and if i do ill atleast explain myself without my daughter feeling the worst ever.

we had so much fun. even being so stupid...
i heard this song i love in anas car...

it honestly makes me feel so amazing. id ont know how to explain it:
Drink up baby down
Are you in or are you out?
Leave your things behind
'Cause it's all going off without you
Excuse me too busy you're writing a tragedy
These mess-ups
You bubble-wrap
When you've no idea what you're like

So, let go
Jump in
Oh well, what you waiting for?
It's all right
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
So, let go
Just get in
Oh, it's so amazing here
It's all right
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown

It gains the more it gives
And then advances with the form
So, honey, back for more
Can't you see that all the stuff's essential?
Such boundless pleasure
We've no time for later
Now you can wait
You roll your eyes
We've twenty seconds to comply

So, let go
Jump in
Oh well, what you waiting for?
It's al right
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
So, let go
Just get in 
Oh, it's so amazing here
It's all right
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown 


the song itself, the way her voice flows...the way it sounds is just so 
awesome.

i painted something. a sunset. it looks...really good hahaha i know thats really cocky but im so proud of myself...i dont know how i did it.
we turned off all the lights and stuff and lit candles and listened to really artistic-ish/ insprirational music. it was fun :)

i was just at twelve oaks and i swear to god the christmas madness is completely on. 
my mom thinks we saw the indian doctor from CNN there- i dont know his name but i asked my mom im like why the hell would someone that important be here in michigan? i know he was with his fobby parents but....yeah i dont know. 

maybe it was him...we saw tim allen at the airport once. then again he is a ""michigander"" haha what a funny word.

anyway- i got some stuff for some people. my daddys birthday is tmrw- so we got him a blazer/coat jacket from lord and taylor because he really needs it for work etc.
its really pretty. :) ok not pretty but ""beautiful"" i dont know whatever haha

i feel sort of nauseous.

i felt really...yeah. all the kurtees and indian embroidary is in. my mom kept going up to things and saying WATCH I BET YOU IT WAS MADE IN INDIA- (my mom is SO not fob shes actually really cool.) and im like ok check and it was so yeah desi priiiide
technically i am half indian bc my dad was born in luknow but w/e 
and technically im iranian bc my grandmother on my moms side was from iran and farsi speaking, obviously urdu speaking as well but you know.

people say i look iranian more then pakistani. who knows?

i hate how i run my fingers thru my hair and two or three hairs come out. cmon im ONLY A TEENAGER- dont want to loose my hair now. i think its just hormones or some shit like that

mmm i think jude law is the new best looking guy in the actor department. same with matthew mccoghanahee- (i know that spelling is WAY off) hes actually in this commerical for a cologne. itd be ashame if the cologne didnt smell good...haha

i have rich girl stuck in my head-

And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
'Cause sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
And you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

"event","YOU GUYS ALL ROCK! thanks so much for all the love and comments.

if i knew that one song, the name of it, donkey in shrek sings it, itslike ""but you gotta have FRIIIIIENNNNDS!"" thats so true..

if anything rite now im just pissed about the situation.

so today was early release. i stayed after for yearbook. whats new! haha it was ok? ashley simmons drove me home, she has this really nice land rover that i want. haha
what else...yeah so i came home, ill be home alone for a while bc my mom went shopping with my aunt whos come from home (pakistan) :).
and yeah so im here bc i have alot of hwk and i feel sick and sort of shitty but thats okay! i dont have time to do the type of shopping they are.

i feel really sulkish. and you know what? im tired of it. im tired of this bullshit. ""this lifes like living in the gutter...all this pain just makes you feel dead""
that is so true ashlee. haha (simpson..)
but then the next verse she says ""slow down, just look a little closer, you might find its not the end, wonder how your life will get better,when your alone you just tear yourself down""

wow i can really relate to her. haha its scary!

anyway! yeah...what else.
nothing i guess...i need to get out of this fucking town is all i know.
that sounded really hickish haha
i just want to go to some really hot warm place and...ah *picture*: stand under a waterfall and feel the rush of the water on my face and then start twirling.
that would be amazing just about now.

but i guess its not happening. instead i have to sit right here in my room in godforsaken michigan...
oh well i love the people here, well i mean you know.

duuuude so i was watching bend it like beckham and stuff. im so proud of my culture. I LOVE BEING A PAKISTANI INDIAN GIRL. WHAT. 
hehe
so i was like coming upstaires to get something and i could hear all the bhangra music playing so i started...you know. being a dork and sort of like doing the kicking move. then again there are like 137827382 bhangra moves that kick. the pivoting one? yeah anyway so i was and then i fucking killed my ankle...WAY TO GO Z!!! WOOOH!

"event","""Give It All Away""

Hey you, living for tomorrow
You sell your dreams for a pocket of change
Hey you, smokin' up your sorrow,
Just pointing fingers at someone to blame
Hey you, you turn your back on your children
It's left you in that big burning bed
This life's like livin in the gutter
All this pain just makes you feel dead

You're just givin it all, givin it all away
You're just givin it all, giving it all away, hey, hey yayayay

Slow down
Just look a little closer
You might find thats its not the end
You wonder how, your life can get better
When you're alone you just tear yourself down

You're just givin it all, giving it all away,
You're just givin it all, givin it all away
You're just givin it all, giving it all away,
You're just givin it all, giving it all away, hey, hey yayayay

Try and find your better half now
Open your eyes, and find yourself

Hey girl, screamin for attention
Once you get it, you throw it away
I'm broken, I'm pickin up the pieces
I won't live in all your mistakes

I'm just givin it all, givin it all away
I'm just givin it all, giving it all away,
I'm just givin it all, giving it all away,
I'm just givin it all, giving it all away, hey, hey yayayay"

When your lost, when your alone and you can't get back again

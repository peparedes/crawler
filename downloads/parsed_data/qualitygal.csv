"event","Well, I worked and easy job over the weekend and made some good money.  This will help me for next month when things get tight again.  Who am I kidding?  Things are tight now.  Just because I got a settlement check does NOT mean that that world is fine.  The money only goes so far.  I just have to look at it that I am one house payment ahead so if nothing else works out, at least I have until November before something bad happens with the house.  But, in my gut - somewhere - I know it will work out with the house.  I have to look at the moment and what I am doing to keep it going and not look at what could be.  So far God has provided for me when I least expected it in some way.  Just when I think I am hitting rock bottom I bounce up.  

Last night I had a dream about an old boyfriend and working with him.  It was weird because I have not seen this guy since I was about 19 but he has been on my mind lately for some reason.  Strange.  Maybe if I see him he can give me a job...lol.  

But, the strange thing with this is....I was doing a job on Friday and ran into an old old friend who was my Maid of Honor at my wedding!  Marge and I were best friends when we both mostly had male friends.  We went through a lot with her kids and a pedophile roommate that she had.  It was a bad bad scene but we made it through and became closer.  We had worked together at CT Limo and man oh man did we have some fun.  So, now I have another friend back in my life.  

This morning I have been reading a life makeover book that gives really good information.  It has given me a good place to start and a way to keep track of how I am changing my life.  I have already started to walk more along with doing more yard work so that I can use some muscles that I seem to rarely use.  I have also been looking for an exercise bike to help get a good start.  I did yard work the other day in kind of an unorthodox manner and man oh man, did my legs hurt!!!  But, they hurt in a good way even though it felt awful...lol.   

Also, today is bill day.  I am going to look at what bills I can pay today in order to get those out of the way.  I also vow to actually answer some of the phone calls coming through on my home phone...lol.  

I have to stop kicking myself. I am very very good at kicking myself.  And, it really does not help when others throw in a kick or two either - MOM!  I have to be more positive and change my priorities right now.  I want to straighten out the house and get everything better organized.  Now that I have the third bedroom pretty much cleared out and set - I can move my desk into there to get it back out of the living room.  This will help to make the living area look better and get some clutter OUT.  I need to vacuum my bed - the cat is shedding...lol.  I am tired of being covered in cat hair no matter what I do or where I go.  I have to keep a lint brush in the car.  I don't remember having this issue even when I have 9 cats.  

Ok, time to get off of here and get started making a difference!

"event","Yes, I see a counselor.  I have been seeing her since I was in a very bad accident on I-91 in East Lyme last year.  I was going for an interview, just driving along minding my own business, when it all happened right in front of me.  Truck parts flying everywhere hitting my NEW car and then watching the tanker jump the guardrail and the driver plus two others die in front of me.  One of them I had talked to on the phone as she had worked for the credit union I have my car loan through.  I never ever ever want to go through that again - I don't think I would survive seeing all of that again.  The police officers kept insisting I go to the hospital due to shock and I refused.  I actually had to sign a AMA form at the accident scene for the paramedics.  Some days I think I should have gone.  

Thank God Janice was living with me at that time.  She was able to pick Jonathan up from school and keep him from watching tv.  Of course, it didnt help that one of his friends called and told him they saw me on tv...lol.  Kids - gotta love em.  

Anyway, lately I have been going through a tough time.  I can't sleep, I am eating all wrong, trying to lose weight, get the house finally settled, and doing it all in pain.  My back and neck hurt worse than you can imagine and there is little I can do now without alot of pain.  But, I was only given so much money from workers comp this past month and I think that is it until I get my settlement from the lady that caused the injury in a car accident.  So, I try to do the yardwork a little at a time along with housework - which sucks...lol.  

I have been given the assignment of writing this to help figure out what I want.  I have told her that I dont know what I want to do for work - I am pretty happy doing the mystery shopping and yet that will not pay the mortgage.  I want to feel better - both mentally and physically.  Some days I forget so many things it is scary.  Physically (like today) I am in so much pain it is hard to walk - although some of that is because I took ANOTHER dive in the front yard the other day.  No, I dont think anyone saw me go down...lol.  But, as for work, I have no ambition, no drive, no goals except that it has to pay me over 50K a year.  

Hmmm, I am getting so tired maybe I can sleep.  Long day tomorrow as I have patron counts to do on Saturday and Sunday.  Woohooo....I get to see the movie Wanted all by myself - 8 times!!!  HAHAHAHAHA  Gotta love it.

More later!

"event","Yeah, it has been months since I last posted.  And, a lot has happened.  Too much in some ways.  Not enough in others.  Kind of a contradiction huh?  lol

I have also come to a conclusion.  Those that cry hardest at a tender moment in a movie or a touching moment where most are not crying are the ones that are hurting the most.  Those that are the loneliest.  My observation is all I guess.

Now, for the catch up.  I bought my house.  Three bedrooms, 1 1/2 baths, a full basement and hard wood floors...ahhhhh.  Oh yeah, and no nosy neighbors yet!!  All of my neighbors seem really really nice and I feel very lucky.  Instead of the train I hear the tree frogs, birds, and crickets. 

My step dad and Uncle Ronny are going to be doing some of the remodeling.  I think they feel bad.  I got my new roof and have my contractor Eric.  I love Eric - he is a complete Italian...lol.  He is so hot and has a loud mouth.  But, you can see he loves his kids and he has helped me out above and beyond.  He is even going to be my date for my sisters wedding!  Yay!  That was just finalized today and I only asked once.  Since we spent some time together over the weekend, I guess it was ok.  

Anyway, I guess this is just a very small piece and I am tired.  Another long day in the Bronx tomorrow.  Wish me luck...lol.

"event","Hello world...lol.  Well, it has been an interesting week so far.  Not a good week - but an interesting one.  And, it could have been worse.  As some of you know, I was in the hospital Monday and Tuesday.  Here is the story.

Monday I was driving to Stamford for work - it wasn't a difficult drive though there was traffic on the Merritt as usual.  Once I got off the parkway, I took some back roads through Stamford.  When I was in the center of town and stopped at a light, all of a sudden I felt very dizzy and light headed.  I closed my eyes and thought, oh no, pleeeeease, I am only 3 blocks from the store.  I thought I was going to throw up.  This lasted only a minute or two and felt better by the time the light changed.  For some reason, this didn't disturb me...strange.  Once I got into the parking garage - it became a totally different scene.  

I parked and sat for a minute because the dizziness was back.  As I sat there, I put my hand to my face, leaned my head back a little and felt really crappy.  I think I was pulling the keys out of the ignition when I passed out.  It was only a minute or so that I was out.  I came to and I called Musco because my movements were really slow and I couldn't think clearly.  When I tried to talk to him, it was like remedial speech - very slow and I couldn't articulate what I was thinking.  I thought I had a stroke so I was starting to get upset.  He told me to sit there, drink some water, and see if it would pass.  I hung up from him and called the owner of the store I was going to.  I told her where I was in the parking garage (of course in an empty part) and she sent someone out with some water.  

At this point, I still couldn't speak clearly and my coordination was still off on my right side mainly.  I tried to stand up and walk and I was staggering like I was drunk and couldn't walk a straight line.  They made me sit back down and called security and the paramedics because it was now about 20 minutes since it had happened and I still was out of it.  

Here come the firefighters and the paramedics.  Great.  Wonderful.  How friggin embarassing.  They all agreed that I needed to get to the ER.  Great, make my day.  So, I handed my keys to the GM of the store stumbled over to the gurney and away we go.  Thru the mall.  Thru another garage and then down part of the sidewalk.  Did I mention this was slightly embarassing?  All the while I was dizzy and thought I was going to throw up so I kept my eyes closed.  

So, into the ER I go.  Everyone was super nice and very helpful.  My speech was finally coming back but I was still a little dizzy and lightheaded.  My BP was very high for me.  Then they try to get the IV in and all of my veins were collapsed - wonderful.  She finally got a vein in my arm after I direct her to the easiest place they usually stick me told her to tie on the tournaquet REAL tight and it should hold.  It did finally but it wasn't easy so there was blood everywhere.  

Then the tests start - X-Rays, CAT scan, blood work, constant monitoring of vitals, EEG (this ruined a perfectly good hair day...lol), and an echo cardiogram.  We tried the MRI machine but there was something wrong with it and you couldn't touch the inside of the machine when you were inside because it would get hot. And, well, I had no way NOT to touch the inside.  So, now I have to go for that next week some time.

Final diagnosis, who knows? I have to go back to the doctor today for a follow up before I feel comfortable driving too far.  Then, get the other testing done that they wanted.  But, my heart is fine so they think it could be neurological.  The MRI will rule out an aneurysm or a clot on the brain...yes, the EEG showed I have one...lol.  So, I am still scared a little though I keep saying to myself that it could just be vertigo gone wild.  It just has to be something correctable because I have Jonathan - failure is not an option.  

I will have more later on - some funny things that happened and also some very touching things.  

See ya later!

"event","As everyone knows, the work for my job runs by the calendar month for the most part.  So, the end of the month is usually stressful.  I like to have two free days at the end of the month. This month my schedule with evals leaves me one day - but, I think I have to go to Peekskill again...sigh.  I could just kick that owner.  

We are taking over the store which mean ALL of us will be taking turns going out there now.  I hope we can find another buyer soon.  It is just too far to be able to manage properly.  

Anyway, tonight I have to go to a meeting in Ft. Lee, NJ which is just over the George Washington Bridge.  I have never driven that way by myself.  So, this should be interesting.  Jonathan is staying overnight at moms because I probably won't be home until midnight.  Then, tomorrow I am slated to go to Peekskill I think - which means leaving here by 6:30am to get there early to do the inventory and close out the old owners business.  I am hoping now that I sent Musco my schedule he will cancel me going out there.  

This weekend was work work work in Manhattan - and even when sleeping i can't escape.  Most of my dreams the last few nights have been about some aspect of work.  And, so far here, all I have done is talk work!  It sucks...lol.

Well, the condo is looking great with the new paint and the new blinds.  The hosue hunting has not been going all that good.  Not like I have time to look for a house anyway.  And, well, if I buy it house, it will need to be near some single guy who will cut my lawn - yes, I have one in mind - lol.  But, the house near him is a little on the expensive side.  Cute neighborhood for sure - and the house is 3bd 2ba which is what I have been looking for.  Oh well, it will work out when it is supposed to.

Overall, I have been in a great frame of mind - I am out from under a whole bunch of shit.  Between getting the condo more organized, painted, the new blinds up, and getting rid of 270 lbs of idiot, I can breathe easier.  A lot easier.  Plus I banked a lot of money this month thanks to bonuses and it all went into savings.  So, if I can keep this up for several months, I will also be able to rest easier on being able to afford a larger mortgage.  Also, we will be able to go on a kick butt vacation...lol...not that I have time...hmmm.

So, even though it has been crazy, it has been good.  Getting a lot of stuff done and am feeling much healthier over all.

May you have an excellent day!

"event","Wow, been a crazy week!  The excitement never stops...lol.  It seems like I haven't had any time to relax - except for this past Saturday when I was not feeling well and pretty much slept for most of the day.  

Work has been crazy - I talked to Musco yesterday and we swear that there has been a full moon out every night because of the crazy stuff going on.  We finally ""sold""  Peekskill only to have the owner back out at the last minute AFTER we got the store open because he thinks it is too much work.  Well, of course it is, it is your business.  Once you get things settled with staff THEN you get time off.  Until then, you need to actually train the people.  Incredible. So, now we have been scrambling the last two days to find someone to buy it or run it.  

Then yesterday I am in another store doing the eval and a customer comes in to tell the owner what had happened the previous night in the store.  One of the employees had threatened him with a knife (in front of witnesses) and told him to get the f*** out of the store.  Alrighty then.  The employee quit immediately after this happened - which was a good thing because the customer had come back with a baseball bat to kick his ass.   Classy, very classy.  The customer said he thought the kid was on drugs.  Well, this guy doesn't do drugs, drink, or smoke.  He has diabetes which has been acting up and can cause wild mood swings when not controlled.  So, that was the drama for yesterday.  I just wanted to go home and here I have to deal with this...lol.

Speaking of drama - the drama has ended - YAY!  I have said my piece and it has ended all the drama of the 2 1/2 yrs.   Funny how the truth can clear the air and give you back your sanity (or what is left of it...lol).  I think all of my friends are jumping for joy at what has transpired.  All have said, it's about time, I deserve better.  Which boy oh boy, do I.  And, I may just have found it!  When you let go of crap - it makes room for the good. I don't need someone with crappy morals who lies constantly to everyone in my life. I have redone my buddy list and opened back up for everyone to see because I don't have to hide myself from anyone anymore - because I don't care!!

Bill #1 from last year keeps calling.  We have not gotten together because I don't want to get together.  As friends, we are good.  I am not interested in anything else with him at all.  But, well, the person who is going to hang my blinds, he is an excellent choice I think.  And, he is coming over tomorrow to finally hang them!!  Yay!!

The house hunt - continues sloooowwwwwly.  We have determined that my condo will not go down in price like a regular home would.  With Waylands help, I am doing up a budget and doing some more saving.  I have already paid off several bills and once the income tax check gets here, two more are going.  So, all in all, it will open up another 200 a month to save.  And save I am going to do!  We set up a plan yesterday that will not only make SURE I can and want to afford a much larger mortgage but will also help me save more towards a downpayment.  So, here I sit waiting for the right thing to come along.  In the meantime, I have finished most of the painting and have been looking at a few other things to deal with living here.  

Well, it is 7:05am and I need to go get ready.  Oh, for those who don't know already - I am back to a brunette color - though there is a little blonde showing thru.  And, it looks awesome!  I have gotten so many compiments on it.  I would have done it years ago if I had not been living to ""please"" someone.  Yuck.  If I ever do taht again, just kick me in the ass will you my friends??  lol  And, well, right a response will ya???  LOL

I love you guys!!

"event","I found a house that no one seems to want me to buy - except maybe Wayland and Rich.  My poor real estate agent is caught between me and my mom.  I love the house. I could even peek my head into the attic and be ok with it - of course Wayland and Rich were up there already.  

I know the house is too close to the road, but, well, who cares?  It has survived this long right?  And we would just be using the back door anyway.  I love the backyard.  And, I love the deck...and no neighbors close by!!  Of course, there is lawn to cut...lol.  

And, Wayland...ahhh Wayland.  What to think there?  I want him...in a way...not sure how...lol.  And Peter, now, I want him in a way too.  I think there is something wrong with me..I dont really want any man right now.  They will interrupt my schedule...lol."

"event","Well, I did it.  I ""outed"" Dennis and I on my myspace.  I can only hope he will understand.  We discussed it about 2 weeks ago and well, I know those six days are going to last forever, or at least until all the tracks are covered.  So, I did it tonight.  Does it possibly have something to do with me PMSing a bit?  I am sure it might in some ways.  But, I think it is more about self respect and truth.  And, the truth will set you free - that is what they say.  

Will he ever talk to me again?  Maybe, maybe not.  If he is a man, it will all be good.  If not, then, well, what can I say?  There are plenty of men out there and I will just have to be more available to let one find me.  Because, lets face it - I haven't been available to anyone else in two years.  Not all the way.   Not ever.  And, I probably will not be for a long time.  

I have so much other stuff on my plate.  Telling the truth was just one more thing off the list.  And, I AM sorry for the grief it may cause. I honestly, truly am. But, that will pass.  And, there will be no more lies to have to tell - no more bullshit.   I am taking myspace off within the next few days.  I am WAY too old to be on there and don't use it for any info besides the show info. And, that I can get from my sister.  

So, my apologies for the grief you are about to encounter.  You are a strong man and will get through it.

"event","Yeah, did my taxes yesterday and I am getting back $3300 total.  That will pay off my furniture and will allow me to stay ahead.  We may even have a vacation again this year.  Or, it may go towards the house.  All I know is, at least one more bill will be gone.  I may pay off some of my credit cards and give them to mom to hang onto so I can't use them..lol.

After doing the taxes we went to look at a house.  The price was way too high, especially with that kitchen!  OMG  Fixures from the 50's and a kitchen straight from the 70'2.  All dark with the scalloped trim over the soffit.  Now, yes, this could all be redone - but, with what they are asking, there would be no money to be made off of doing these improvements.  There is paneling through most of the house that the contractor is painting white.  The living room was nice though an odd shape, the three bedrooms all were in good shape and of decent size.  The master bedroom had its own bath!!!  The sunroom was nice too with the exception of the face brick on the walls.  Anyway, that is a wash but it was nice to see it because now I won't fantasize about it anymore - oh, and it still had the old people smell to it - odd.  

So, today I am going to look at two more.  One is almost identical to one that I put a bid on last year and lost.  The other has been totally redone and I think is about 70 feet from the entrance to Yalesville School on one side and about 100 feet from the front entrance to a Subway store...lol.  Man, if I get that, Dave Balch will be pissed cuz I would just be too close.  But, of all, that house is priced the lowest and is really the cutest.  The pics online look really good and the house is 1400 sq ft.  So, there are a lot of plusses.

My computer has been acting up, I think I have just left it on too long...I don't think it has been off in two weeks.  Of course, it is acting up because I just paid it off and the one year warranty is going to be up later this month...lol.

I never did get to painting yesterday.  Too busy running around going crazy all day.  I also got ALL the papers off of the dining rom table FINALLY.  What an awesome feeling.  Everything where it belongs...yesa.  So, today is painting day.  I hope I can move the tv table I have...it is more of a side table/buffet table thing and is fairly heavy.  Also, this is going to go onto the wall with the windows again.  I like where the tv is now but there is really no way to maneuver the furniture the way I want it where the tv is now.  So, back it goes!  Now, to figure out what pictures/art I am going to hang on the wall...hmmmmm.  

So, that is the day...looking at houses, painting, and deciding if I should put my condo on the market.  Yes, I am afraid - I have to do this all on my own.  If I make a mistake, it is my financial future at stake.  It would be so much easier in many ways to stay here.  I can save money (when I am not on workers comp) and not have to worry.  If I had been in a house when I was on workers comp, I most likely would have either lost it, or would have gotten behind in some bills and ruined the credit I have worked to build.  But, I want this and I have to overcome my fear.  I was strong enough to leave Florida to make it better and I am strong enough to do this.  

When I was having my taxes done yesterday, Gene (the tax man) was saying how far I have come since he first met me.  I had almost no furniture, was living in a little rented condo that I absolutely hated, driving my poor little Toyota Tercel the looked ok but was not quite running all that great (though it never broke down), and I was working as a receptionist for the school system that was boooorrrrrring!   Now, I own my own place, my credit is MUCH better, I have furniture, and I don't have to worry about clothing or feeding my son.  Oh yeah, and I put away a good amount in my IRA last year.  I need to be proud of what I have accomplished.  Wayland always tells me that too.  

Oh, and the ""fixer upper"" house?  OMG  Mold on the outside of the house, the wood is rotting on the outside, it needs new windows and all new siding on the outside.  But, it is across the street from the park, in a good neighborhood, and has a lot of potential.  I think I would still buy it - along with a LOT of bleach...lol.

So, now to start the day.  Going to take a shower early (now) and get moving.  Lots to do! 

Hope you all have a great day!

"event","There are days when I question who I am.  Not what I stand for but what I do, say, and am.  Some days I feel like the dumbest bunny on the planet.  Like today.  How many times can I be insulted?  

First the boss.  Nothing like talking about the results of the ""popularity"" poll taken with the owners and saying he thought I scored the lowest...sigh.  Which really, the score is not low.  The highest it goes is five and I got a 4.3.  He said out average was either a 4.3 or 4.5...if the average is 4.3 how can I be the lowest???  Anyway, nothing like being made to feel like crap in front of the other staff who all looked mortified.  I talked to Mel about it and she said the only reason I scored lower - if I did - is because I actually do the job right and hold the owners to a higher standard. For some reason, that did not make me feel much better - a little but not much.

Now, funny enough...during the meeting we were tossing around ideas and issues that were coming up and I was coming up with my ideas for solutions (weird, most of the other staff rarely have anything to contribute) and JP was like, man, Philly, you are right on target today woohoo, look at you go.  Yeah, ok JOhn, calm down...like I don't have ideas on other days?  Who was the one who coordinated operation computers the other day for the Bronx? It wouldnt have gotten done at all if not for me.  I am feeling very under valued.

Then comes lunch...talking about Pauls stats being too high after his physical like BP, cholesterol and everything and everyone is kind of chatting about it.  I said, wow, my doc said I was the healthiest person (if not the clumsiest) in his practice because my bp is always 110/70 and my cholesterol was 174 and all of my numbers are all within range.  He says, wow, I never would have thought that in a person your size, that is excellent.  Now, ok, thank you for thinking that is excellent but well, just because I am a person ""of size"" (and exactly how big am I, hmmm?????) doens't mean we have to be unhealthy.  I climb on the counters, move normally, and do almost everything else anyone else can do.  I move faster than David does.  

Then Dan says, oh, what Mall did you see that doctor in?  You have to be kidding me.  Bill says, no, what vet was that huh?  What vet did you see??  I was like OMG...I think I just had a stunned look on my face and didn't say anything.  I didn't know quite what to say.  But, if I hadn't been blocked into my seat by Musco, I would have gotten up and left.  It was embarassing and uncalled for.

So, went back to the office and try to talk to Musco on the way back about gicing the staff regular evaluations for performance and regular feedback.  And, either he was not listening or was playing stupid ( I think more not listening) and started talking about the audit on the evals and how he wished we didn't have to do them.  I was like, hello, I was talking about evaluating US and giving feedback.  Most normal companies have some sort of system set up for a review - not this one.  You fly by the seat of your pants until you really fuck up.  

At the office I set up the computer for Peekskill.  I can't wait to go back there and yet, I don't want to go back there.  I looked up the convent to see what was going on there and they are making the actual convent into 12 multi-level condos.  I signed up for the waiting list for information when they have more like floor plans and such.  They are also going to do 125 other homes/condos on the upper property around the convent in the same stone and architectural style.  I want to live there.  In another time and another place.  Only because in this life, it just wouldn't make sense - I don't know if that makes sense.  I think what I love about there is all going to change and that saddens me.  The one place in this world where I feel I truly belong and I have loved with all my heart since I have seen it - and a developer is going to change it.  What are they going to do with the cemetary?  And the nasty dirty fish pond that used to be beautiful?  We shall see.

I found a house.  I want it.  It is a ""diamond in the rough"" as Dennis says.  It was built in the 70's and has electric heat!!  Of course, all the old stuff is still there and stuff needs replacing.  And, there has been some neglect.  I may try to talk to the real estate agent again tomorrow.  We are supposed to look at another house that I KNOW I am not going to buy, it just is too much money for me on my own.  

Anyway, I was talking to Dennis about the house thing and he says - you are only going to look til you get tired of it and you will end up staying right where you are.  Well, no I won't, not if I don't have to.  I refuse to stay stuck here.  I want a house - am I scared?  YES!  It is a lot of responsibility and I can only hope that I make the right decision.  Not to mention financial wise.  He called it a welfare hotel once - why would I want to stay here if that is the way people perceive it?  I feel like I have to apologize for living here all the time.

So, yes, I know I am PMSing to a point...and, even after all the crap, I haven't cried or anything.  I think I am kind of numb.  Numb can be good - you don't feel much of anything.  It is better than feeling too much.  

Well, now I don't feel like writing anymore...lol.

Tomorrow will be better - I get to do my taxes...lol.

Night!

"event","You know when a Monday really starts off...bad?  And then proceeds to get worse and just never gets back on track.  Not that the day is a total loss but it just seems, off?  And you wish that you could just go back and redo.  Some days I really wish if I yelled REDO it would work.  

The PPT went fairly well.  Jonathan is moving ahead and I am rethinking the whole Sylvan thing.  I may just try working with him more at home...sigh, I hate this.  Does anyone else ever wonder if they are screwing up their kid?  lol  We changed the main teacher for his TLC reading and Jonathan got excited when I told him.  So, I think that will motivate him some more also.

Dennis...ahhh, men.  Do men understand us?  Do we understand them??  The simple answer - NO.   But, at least we worked out some issues.

Work...the first store I went to was full of issues. Way too full...tuna 7 days old.  Yuck.  The second store was a joy to be at.  The people there are sooooo nice.  Very friendly and great to talk to.  I really love them.  They are good people.

After work...seemed like nonstop.  Pick up J, came home and ate, did homework, reading, four (yeah four)loads of laundry, emails, the bathroom (yeah, stomach still not quite right), and general stuff.  So, absolutely NOTHING exciting in a good way today.  How crappy is that???  LOL

Ok, so I am not in the best of moods today. Like I told Mel, I took a Xanax before I went to the PPT and I don't think it worked....either that or I was REALLY bad off and the Xanax just brought it down to mildly bad.  It is the first Xanax in months...I am not even sure it worked...I need to check the expiration date...lol.

Anyway, now I am hanging out in chat with the man and doing a Sudoku puzzle...I am hooked.  So, have a good night and may tomorrow be a great day for all.

"event","Well, last week I got a lot done around the house.  I made it presentable for the masses...and one particular person...lol.  I also was able to organize some books and papers to see what I could throw out.  Today I am going even further and going thru clothes and finishing up with the books in my room.  I seem to have an abundance of both.  This will clear out some space so that I can store stuff in my closet and yet be able to find stuff..lol.   

I am looking at houses again.  Well, looking online.  I found one house that I love and the neighborhood is decent and close to the park.  It also has a beautiful sunroom on the back of the house and a nice back yard.  But, it also costs WAY too much money.  From the pricing, it seems that housing has gone up another 20-30k in the last few months.  Houses I looked at previously were MUCH less expensive.  A condo like mine only a little larger is going for 133k...that is just ridiculous...but, if someone wants to pay ME that much more power to them!  Then I will have 60k to put down on a place.  

This week I am signing Jonathan up for Sylvan Learning for reading.  I jsut have to take out a loan to do it...sigh.  So, I figure I paid off the furniture, paid off the computer, and my credit cards are getting MUCH better...I will be able to handle it.  Plus the child support should be increasing which will all be put towards the tuition loan.  I was thinking though of taking out a little larger loan and getting all new flooring in the condo.  This will make me feel MUCH better.  Just not sure what I want - I think I am going to hire a designer to take a trip out here once the living room is painted (which should be by tonight!).  

Anyway, moving right along...well, slowly...right now I just want to go back to sleep. I think the lack of food is doing me in along with my bum shoulder which hurts when I turn onto it.  Tired all the time.  

Ok, time to get the butt in gear!!!  Have a great day!

"event","Well, home today sick.  But, got some smaller stuff done and also finished TWO courses online.  Audited one and passed and finished another.  So, I am up to FOUR classes done before any coworkers have even started to the best of my knowledge.  

This weekend was interesting.  Saturday was great with J and I going to see Curious George with my sister.  And then later on we went to Chuck E Cheese and J and Charlie played games.  He misses Lisa and Charlie so bad.  Mainly Charlie though because he used to spend so much time with him after school.  We went to Wendy's for supper and I did so well!! All I had was a baked potato and a small chili.  Woohoo!!  

Yesterday we stayed home all day because I wasn't feeling well.  But, I still did a LOT of cleaning and organizing and it was great to see it all come together.  I also got together a lot of the PTO stuff and am finishing that today.  

Now, if i could just get to the painting - that is so frustrating!  I need to get that done so that I can do the molding and replace the damn flooring.  I HATE this carpet!!!!!!!  The next step in getting this house in order though is getting rid of the stuff that I have put aside to GO!  J has a lot of good toys and clothes that I need to take to the consignment shop and I just don't have the time nor the energy to do it.  And I am NOT going to wait until spring to have a garage sale...lol.  So, there is a small pile of stuff, and a bag that will go into the trunk full of clothes.  Knowing me, the first donation site will get it.  And, I suppose that will be fine too.  

Checked on getting the cabinets refaced, flooring, and a new light fo the hallway and for the dining room.  I would love to do over the bathroom but my God, it is way too small to do much with.  Maybe a new cabinet and some new lighting.  And, flooring of course!

Well, time to go and figure out what to do next.  Have to get the PTO stuff out of the car along with the other papers I want to go through.  My main concern is the checkbook...but I think that is in the car...lol.  And, J has karate tonight - so we will be off to that and then to Hanks to drop off the PTO stuff.  

Then, thankfully, home again...to finish up the laundry!  Woohoo!  The fun never ends.  Hmmm, speaking of which, I should go put some in now.  And, finish up some little things to get the sparkle back.  God, can I not even take a break when not feeling well?? The answer: no.  

Well, now if anyone wants to come over.....lol.

"event","What a day yesterday!  Worked a store opening in Waterbury that went well.  Got the store open in about 3 1/2 hours from when the food started to arrive. I think that is a record!  But, I was soooo tired by the end of the day even though I felt good - I had stocked all the boxes in the refrigerator and freezer by myself and then organized it even more later.  So,my muscles got a goooooood work out.  And, today they are sore but in a good way!

I picked up Jonathan from school and he got another 8!!  That is the highest number he can get on a daily report.  So, as a reward, we went and rented two movies at Hollywood Video.  We haven't been there in 10 months so it was pretty neat.  I saw WAY toomany movies I would like to see that he shouldn't.  But, I didn't rent those - when would I watch them?  After he goes to bed it is more work/classes time.  I need to slow down on the whole work thing and I feel I can't.  

Anyway, we brought out blankets and laid on the floor and watched a cute but really budget kids movie.  That was really cool kind of bonding time.  Then it was time for J to get to bed!  I think, woohooo, I can go finish my marketing course!! That would be three classes COMPLETE!  

Well, I start the class which takes FOREVER (15minutes) to load. Then, it kicks me off part way through and I couldn't get back on.  I was soooo frustrated!  So, I play around with it and think I will get it loaded.  I fall asleep while I am waiting.  When I wake up, I realize that my whole AOL is jammed and I can't do anything with it.  So, I figure screw it and turn the whole damn thing off and fall back asleep. I think I was traumatized waking up and the computer wasn't on...lol.

Then, this morning, we went to go see Curious George at the movies with my sister.  She had gotten free passes from work and everyone she works with was there.  It was SUCH a good movie!!  Wayyyy too cute.  I was very surprised. In this day and age where everything is so fast paced and the movies have allthis high tech stuff in them, this one was different.  It had an old style feel to it.  And, the story itself was very cute and very touching.   And, I didn't have any chocolate or popcorn - just some pretzel bites!!  Whoo hooo!! Maybe the diet thing is kicking in.  

Anyway, now we are home and we watched another movie that J had rented.  And, I have been looking at news online.  Seems I can never read enough about anything.  I read more news that has no impact on my life whatsoever...lol.  And then, I started doing this.  Just rambling on.  

I guess I should go and do something that will make a difference.  But, I am just not feeling well - my throat hurts a little and my sinuses are acting up.  I also need to see if Lisa and Charlie are coming to Chuck E Cheese with us later.  If they aren't then I am not going today.  Not up to chasing him around...lol.  

Tomorrow I am giving back all of the PTO Treasurer stuff and get rid of that responsibility.  One of my friends told me that everyone understands totally - the reason they didn't go for the position is because there is a lot to do and they just don't want to do it.  They pick and choose what will be good for them. So, I don't feel quite as bad as I did. 

As much as I love you all...you may notice an entry that is not available to everyone.  No offense to anyone but everyone has thoughts that they need to keep to themselves because feelings are not always right - they just are.  And, well, with my period coming on - they my feelings are all over the board including some that are not so attractive.  I guess that is part of being a human being.  

Sorry for this being so long.  I am in a chatty mood today and can't seem to control myself...lol.

"event","Well, I really put my foot into eh?  One of my friends that reads this was telling me I sounded very anti-man in one of my last blogs on here.  And said, well, don't you go out with SOMEONE once in awhile?  Someone you care about?  And I said, well, ya!  Well, sure hope he doesn't read that because it sounds very negative...so, this is in response to that.  

I care very very deeply about the man I see once in awhile (ya, it is you from RI...LOL).  And, he knows it - I think.  I wouldn't trade him for anything or anyone in the world.  What we have is kind of special in a way, I think.  I think.  Well, I know it is for me...I can't speak for anyone else....lol.  But, I sure hope I am.  And, well, would I love to spend the rest of my life with him in one way or another?  Yep.  Is he gonna keep me around forever?  Well, now comes the part where I realllly would like a crystal ball thank you very much!  lol   So, I will admit, I get nervous sometimes and try to put up a wall so I don't get hurt and I am sure it sends out some sort of mixed-up girl signal. So, yeah, I slip and get insecure once in awhile.  As most of you know, I am NOT the most patient person in the world and I like to know what is going to happen before it really does.

And, I always have flashbacks to when I was 7 yrs old and I lived on Weybosset Street in New Haven.  There were a whole bunch of us riding our bikes in the basement of the apartments we lived in and just playing innocently.  I found out that the goofy kid I liked, Michael Testa, liked me.  I was like, you like me??  DO you still like me?  You really like me?  And I think I asked him so much that he yelled, leave me alone!  LOL  I think that pretty much ended it.  So, I try to NEVER ask that question - too much...lol.  So, I feel like I am in the dark some times and not ""in the know"" and well, that is uncomfortable...and, what if you ask and the answer is NO! Devastation!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!   lol

Anyway, a cute tidbit.  My mom sent me this email called Life.  In it was a cute statement that ""Depression is just anger without enthusiasm"" and I thought AHAAAA!!  That is the key!  For weeks I have been saying that instead of getting depressed, I allow myself to get mad!  So, there is definitely some truth there.  Because before if someone made a derogatory comment, or tried to get under my skin, I would get depressed and really just file it away to replay over and over and over again until I really felt like crap.  Now, I get mad like I should.  

I think it started in December. The day that I quit (again).  JP was ragging on me non stop for 40 minutes and I was crying and so upset because of the lies that were coming out of his mouth.  Then, I got to my store, sat in the parking lot and calmed down.  All of a sudden, I got mad - really mad.  I was NOT going to put up with the abuse anymore.  Screw him.  Once I went in and told Paul and he discovered that JP was lying to HIM and saying things to ME - he bust a gut - especially when he realized my mom was in the conference room waiting for me.  I was serious.  

The last 6-7 weeks have been VERY good at work.  JP leaves me alone because he KNOWS that now, I will get mad and call Paul.  I will NOT bow down to him and his petty games ANYMORE.  It can be actually very funny to watch the interaction in the office now too.  I get many compliments.  Now, HE wants to be on MY good side.  I just want to be able to do my job in PEACE.  And, that is what I got - not to mention that they are realizing (because of Wayland) just how good I am at what I do.  

Yesterday we were on a conference call in our monthly meeting.  It was about the new online ordering.  I was one of two people to use the system in any way and there were issues with it.  So, I got in line to ask questions.  And, I asked the good ones.  So, now, they want me to be a part of designing the website WITH the outside vendor to be sure that we get all the options we need to develop the best system.  They took my name and number and one of the IT guys from HQ that knows me told the guy he has my info also.  So, that would be cool if that pans out.  I will know that my input made it better not just for MY stores but for the system as a whole.  

Also, the marketing has been going great.  We were up WAY over HQ average partly due to the marketing efforts we are all putting in.  And, a lot of the coupons, bagstuffers, and fliers are ones that I produced in Excel so that it would be easy for ANY Field Rep to use in the field.  Oh yeah, thanks to Dennis for changing over the format in the logo for me one night!  That is at the top of every item!  lol  

Also, Musco has found that several of the other Field Reps either do not care or are just too damn dumb to do the job totally correct.  He sent Mel and I to help get a store opened and to another to do some computer work.  He sends us because we work very well as a team and get the job done and done right!!  He tells me all the time - that is why I send YOU - cuz you know what the hell you are doing.  Well, hello, then PAY ME BETTER!!  LOL  

This week Jonathan has had an awesome week both in school and at home.  He has gotten to see Grandma and the rest of the family and got to play with the dog.  He seems to be doing better on his reading but still is behind the eight ball. So, we are up for another PPT on 2/27.  My mom is coming.  She will keep me grounded in the meeting so that I won't fly off at the Principal - again.  I will also take TWO Xanax before we go...lol.  

Got to see Dennis twice this week!!  Woohoo!  Good food, great conversation, awesome man (yeah, that is some buttering up ya think??  lol)  It was so good to get OUT.  Even if I feel very very large while in the car...lol.  And, here is where the lapse in judgement comes in....I went out for pizza with the guys for lunch - a late lunch.  And, being hungry, and with shrimp pizza, ate a slice too many.  So, my stomach was just NOT loving me.  I felt like I was going to explode.  And of course my nerves were acting up because I didnt want to be late to meet him.  I get in the car, we go get a dessert at Libby's (which was AWESOME!) and I proceed to eat MORE!  My stomach was like NO WAY you stupid idiot...lol.  And proceeds to just growl and put up a fuss trying to process everything in there.  So, it sounds like I have gas...realllll attractive.  Then, I really feel like I am going to explode and think, hey, I will just undo my pants a little...LOL.  Yep, another real female move...lol. And, I wonder why he didnt want to make out.  Well, hey, its not like this all the time but I was in PAIN.  Not like I was burping and fartign right???  lol

Well, I got off the phone with Dennis a little bit ago and I was tired because I layed on my back.  When I came on to finish this off, I got another go at it...lol.  Now, I really need to sleep because we are opening a Subway in a truck stop in Waterbury tomorrow.  I get to work with Musco - which will either be fun or torture.  So, I need to go lay on my back now...lol

Nighters all!

"event","Wow, where to begin?  So much to tell and so little urge to type.  Right now I have the beginning of a crying headache and I feel slightly wiped out.  With the exception of what happened immediately after I picked up Jonathan, it was a great day.  But, that will come later in this entry.

This weekend J and I went to a get together for families that have kids with upper limb anomalies.  Some kids were just missing some fingers, some hands.  There was one little boy who looked like he had sticks for arms - there was basically no muscle, just skin attached to bone.  But, he was amazing to watch - he could pick up a piece of paper off of a table with no problems.  It was interesting to see.  

There were some problems with the hotel as they were remodeling and the hallway smelled of new carpet - not a pretty odor...lol.  When we got to our first room it smelled like someone had smoked 3 packs of cigarettes in there with the door closed - it just permeated everything.  So, after they tried to deodorize the room while we were out, we finally moved.  

The second room was MUCH better but had no heat.  As I called downstairs to say it was a little chilly I noticed that there was a switch underneath the wall unit and I thought, hmmmm....so as they answered, I said hold on, I think I found it.  I flipped the switch under the unit and viola, heat.  But, they still had the thermostats on timers so unless you did a complete over ride, the room went back down to 62 at night.  With Jonathan hogging all the covers, it was cold, too cold to get up so I fought for some of the covers back...lol.  

The weekend went really really good though in terms of meeting people and Jonathan having a lot of fun.  We made crafts together and really interacted a lot.  I think his best time though was when he got to eat lunch by himself with all of the other Helping Hands kids.  Every person in the room was similar to him in what they went or are going thru.  They played Bingo, ate lunch, had cookies, and got prizes.  He had an excellent time.  

They also had a parents meeting where you could discuss what you go thru as parents - your fears, how you handle certain things, what to expect, etc.  I only had a babysitter for J for about and hour and a half so I only stayed for part of it. It was good to hear that I am pretty much on the ball handling the difference and that I am just like the other parents in dealing with things.  

The odd thing was - it was mainly families - not really any single parents.  And, it was funny when I would mention that I was a single parent, some of the people would kind of look at me like I grew another head - interesing - lol.  Maybe because they wouldn't think a single parent would have the money to do this??  Or that we wouldn't take the time??  Strange.  

And, that kind of brings me to after school today.  My day went well after I got started due to a late school opening.  Got two stores done and a lot accomplished at my second store - I felt the meeting went well especially from the marketing stand point.  Then, I go to pick up Jonathan.  Turns out he had a not so good morning and then proceeded to cut the button off of a new shirt - why he did that, I don't know.  They saved the button so now I have to hunt down my sewing stuff and sew it back on.  

On the way out of the building the Principal was there.  We talked some PTO stuff for a minute and then she talked to Jonathan.  Apparently she was in his classroom today and he was not doing his work even though he knew the answers.  There are times she really talks down to people and she was doing this to him and you could tell he felt bad.  But, I let the conversation continue for a minute or so.  Then she tells him to go wait in the car for me.  I was like, what?? hmmm, ok.

So, she proceeds to tell me that it definitely looks like he is not going to progress into second grade, that Mrs. Downey is telling her that I am not helping him do his homework, that I leave him on his own to do this and that I don't read with him.  WHAT????  I do WHAT???  Ohhhh lady, wrong move.  I think my head popped off.  But, I try to stay calm though I am miffed.  First, they say that I am ""too"" involved in his education - now, if he is not progressing, I am not involved enough??  Give me a fucking break.  So,I am getting mad because not only is she telling me that a) J is not going to go to second grade b) I am not helping with his homework but now also c) she is talking to me like I am 2 yrs old.  So, what do I do?  Yup, the tears are coming - slowly but they are there.  

So, she starts in about that I obviously am having a hard time with this - that I obviously still don't understand the whole Transitional program - that I am pressuring Jonathan and it is affecting him - maybe I need to go talk to someone - blah blah blah.  I tell her, I understand the program - I have come to terms that he may be staying back - and she was like, oh well, he is definitely staying back.  Well, not for nothing but I was previously told that they would determine that in March - not January.  There was more conversation about things and she just kept cutting me off.  But, between the condescending tone and what she was saying - I blew the gasket.  I yelled at her, until someone is sitting in the dining room and can see what I am doing do not assume anything.  You want psycho white trash - I will give you psycho white trash.  I am fucking tired of this crap.  Do NOT tell me what I think - you are not inside my head.  Do NOT tell me what you THINK I am doing or not doing until you know the facts.  I was so ready to hit her that I actually turned and walked a few feet away to keep the distance...lol.  

Then of course, after I calm down from yelling she is all quiet and says, now, Phyllis, do you think that was appropriate? Do you really think that is how you should conduct yourself??   OMG  I went off again.  I said, conduct myself??  Yes, I think it is appropriate when I am being talked down to, lied to, and apparently talked about.  Fuck appropriate.  You want to try and say I am not doing MY job?  Until you know that for a fact, keep your fucking mouth shut - ohhh yes, I was into the ""F"" word tonight....sigh.  I think she made me just a little upset.  

So, am I proud of blowing up? No, but I have just had it.  Am I proud of standing up for myself and speaking my piece, yes. But, if that was what it took to shut her up then so be it.  I am so tired of people thinking I am not feeding J right, and now not doing his homework, or not reading.  Hellloooo...what the hell else am I doing between 6 - 8:30???  He is not eating chocolate or hot dogs every night for supper and we haven't had mac and cheese (thank God) in a few weeks.  He drinks juice, not soda.  We are actually one of the top reading families in the SCHOOL because we are always reading to each other.  This is documented by the damn reading logs we send back to school every Monday morning.  Why must people think the worst?  I know I can be down on myself a LOT but I KNOW I am a good mom - not that I dont make mistakes, but I have done a good job overall.  

Then on the way home I had to call Wayland back.  And that was another whole conversation about work...ugh.  He is very supportive and gave me some good tips actually.  It is weird but even though he and I have had times when we wouldnt tak to each other, he is always there when I am really down.  The day I had my accident last year, he was there for me both times I was really in need.  So, I am taking some of his advice to move ahead and bring myself to the next level.  And, the best advice was - JP doesn't want me to move ahead because then HE will have to do all the hard work.  People notice what I do - and what he doesn't.  So, if I prove myself with the Waterbury group - and their sales increase - then there is a chance that I will be able to focus on that and only have 15 stores to do - maybe. 

So, tonight I write down my goals for the coming year - how much money I want to make (gonna take a long time writing those zeros after the first number...lol),  and any other goals I want to accomplish.  Then every day, I am going to write down what I did to achieve those goals.  This will help to keep me focused.  I think I need a notebook...lol."

"event","Hi there folks...well, as most of you know, I tried out for The Biggest Loser today.  It was an open casting call in Manhattan at Planet Hollywood.  This entailed standing outside in the freezing cold for about 6 hours and then inside for about 30 miutes.  We then filled out a short application and went as a group of twelve to a table where we met with a casting assistant.  We were there for about maybe 10 minutes total (everyone was saying it was less but I am sure it was about that long).  We introduced ourselves, said our age, said what we do, etc.  He then asked us what our logo would be...huh?  lol  Some people didn't really answer the question...they expounded on why they wanted to be there...including the guy that they picked immediately out of the group.  

My answer was - The Skinny Person Has Escaped.  Because everyone has the ""thin person trapped inside the fat body"".  Well, my thin person is taking over.  I have done it before, I will do it again.  But, I have to admit - part of me is glad that I didn't get on.  I think that the pressure would be on to be 150 or less and I simply a)can not maintain that and actually eat ever again...lol  b) I don't think I want to be that thin.  Though I have some lumps now, I like my body curvy.  When it is not, I have sharp hips and my chin looks way way too sharp - I always thought I looked like witchy poo from that kids show.  

Anyway, if it totally comes down to the fact that I do not get on (there is still some chance) then I will move on.  Although, I must admit, I am disappointed.  I will miss out on the chance in a lifetime to provide my son with a house and a dog.  Now, we are stuck here.  For now.  For longer than I hoped earlier this week.  But, the fight is not up.

While I was there today, I was interviewed by The Post.  Tomorrow I need to check the paper to see if my name is in there.  It will be possibly embarassing because I mention how much I THINK I weigh.  But, it also goes into why I think I am overweight - what is the reasoning behind it.  Also, when I mentioned that I was a single mom, she asked if I thought the weight may have something to do with being single.  I told her no, I felt more like being a mom kept me single.  Then I said, well, I have had boyfriends, there are plenty of men who like larger women.  

Anyway, I was thinking about it on the way home.  Could it have an impact?  Sure, there are a lot of guys that dont like heavy women so it does cut back on the chances for a date.  Many people - not just men - (and no I am not gay) can't see past the cover to the book.  In any way.  I am ambitious, funny, have a great sense of humor, intelligent, and on a good day - cute, or maybe even a little pretty.  Not to mention loyal - woof...lol.  Too bad most can't appreciate that.  Oh well, their loss.

So, tomorrow I start on my new life.  And it is going to be a hell of a lot better than it was no matter what.

Ok, I am tired, sore and I need to check out a new work website...apparently I am now going to be the expert on this new marketing tool.  I really am going to ask for a pay raise...lol.  

Have a great night and do NOT send cookies...lol

"event","You knooowwwww....I am a single mom who would love to have the finer things in life.  But, well, as much as I would love to have money, fame and all that other stuff....I am just not so desperate for it to go on this show on VH1.  These women are fighting to ""be with"" Flava Flav.  Now, I have a problem with this.  I know that there is someone for everyone - no matter who they are, what they look like, what they believe in - even several someones.  But, I just can not honestly see what would honestly attract ANYONE to this man.  Has he got fame - for now.  Has he got money?  Debatable.  He has kids my different ""baby mama"" and has not done anything significant in music in years.  His only claim to fame at this point is whatever he does on VH1.  I can NOT imagine being that desperate.


Now, Celebrity Fit Club...Jeff Conaway...what a loser and I don't mean it in a good way...lol.  This guy is so junked up it is incredible.  Like no one noticed this beforehand?  Oh, I am sure they did and thought this guys MAJOR issues would make great television - oh wait, it does.  But, overall, it is very sad to see someone who had so much, fall so far.  

Great, well, just got out of IM with Bill...sigh...he has been wanting to sit down adn talk for weeks to see where the ""disconnect"" happened.  Says that in IM, it is no place to have a conversation like that - well, I agree but there is no other way we are going to talk.  So, anyway...I was venting about something tonight and we launch into this conversation...sigh.  I really don't want to come out and say, look, you are a total and complete slob and I am completely turned off by you at this time.  I can't say that.  So, we go around and around with the other issues that had been there and finally I say, look, nothing will change the outcome,and nothing is going to change the way we are and the needs we have.  Period.  With that, the conversation comes to an end and he has to go to sleep all of a sudden.  Not easy...sigh.  

So, now it is late...and I am watching a show about gaming...hello, I need to go to sleep.  I actually have to work tomorrow...lol.

"event","Well, it is late of course.  That is always when I really feel like writing.  And, I am really tired of playing solitaire - badge or no badge...lol. So much has happened over the last week or so - some I will write about and some I won't.  

First, the days after Christmas....kind of boring, got work done, picked out the paint for the condo, and Bill came over.  Bill...where to begin?  We know where it ends.  When I first met him, well, I was not really attracted but he was very nice and I figured well, give it a chance.  Then he was real good with Jonathan - big bonus points there.  And, well, add in the house and a chance to have a ""real"" family for J and most of the bases were covered.  The shitty part was, I would have to live with him to get all of that.  And, it makes me really not proud of myself to say that because he is a nice guy.  Just not the guy for me.  Anyway, he came over with some really nice presents for Jonathan and a DVD/VCR for myself.  I spent all of about $50 on him which is what I spent on basically everyone but J, my mom, and my stepdad...oh yeah, and Dennis...lol.  So, again, I felt bad but I never ever expected him to give us all of that. And, his daughter hinted that he wanted to give me a ring to marry him.  Greeeeat.  Let me just beat my head against the wall - it will be a lot less painful.

Work, work has been ok...they have oficially divided up most of the territory for marketing efforts to be made.  I have been told I have ben doing a good job in this area so that is a positive.  I wish I could just do it full time but the owners are VERY hard to convince.  They are pennywise and pound foolish.  Ridiculous.  

Jonathan has been sick the last few days so that sucks.  Not only because my baby isnt feeling well, but because I am behind on work!  I am going to work tomorrow (or is it really today?) to get a few stores done and get started!  Poor Jonathan, he has been not feeling well and I keep yelling at him to LAY DOWN AND RELAX!  During his time laying down, I have been trying to clean and organize - and play the damn pogo games!  

Death - This week an acquaintances daughter passed away and I have to go to the wake on Sunday.  I dont want to go because I know I will cry.  Brenna was only 7 yrs old and one grade ahead of Jonathan.  She died of liver failure due to Wilsons Disease.  With this, I dont want to go into any more detail.

The Biggest Loser - I am going to an open casting call.  Wayland and I have ben discussing my weight.  He says that I would be ultra hot if I would lose weight.  Gee thanks.  Anyway, I get to thinking about it and I want it.  Bad.  It would not only give me the head start I need to lose the weight but will give me the money I need for a house without a huge mortgage.  Also, it may open some other doors to other opportunities.  The only things that bother me about going are leaving Jonathan for that long and missing Dennis.  So, of course now dowbts are creeping in but I know I can go on and I know I can win - plus Dennis is on a major diet change and I just dont want to be huge.  I want to be pretty.

Ok, on a lighter note because I am PMSing and I am really really tired cuz it is almost 1:00am....

Leona Helmsley - there were pictures of her in the news and in one picture she looks like an old Mick Jagger - ok Mick in drag - and in the other she looks like an old Steven Tyler.  It was tooooo funny.  I thought she was dead!

There are good weeks and bad weeks - the ups and downs of life.  And I am always very aware that life can be worse.  I just want it to be better and right now I can't see that very clearly some days.  I miss romance and sex.  I miss knowing for sure someone cares.  I know I know...I miss, I want...blah blah blah...but, well, this is my journal and right now I am in the throes of my period and I just want to be held ok??  lol

Well, now that it is after one o'clock, I guess I should stop yammering on and get to sleep.  Jonathan has woken up twice and I need to go in and shut off my bedroom light.  And, it just occurred to me that I should have donw laundry tonight...sigh. 

I miss all of you since I haven't seen anyone lately.

"event","Well, I am glad its over - can I hear and Amen??  This was a good year only because J really got into it and we did some cool stuff for him.  But, overall, it just wore me out more than anything - I took naps yesterday and today to try and catch up on the sleep. The stress has been getting to me big time and I can't wait for the new year.  Melinda invited me to her party on New Years Eve so that will be a new way to ring it in I guess.  And, today her parting comment was - there will be lots of single guys there.  Great, more rejection...lol.  

The best thing that we did - and I really didnt want to do it - was spreading out reindeer dust. It was a small bag of oatmeal mixed with really fine small glitter.  He said that the glitter was shiny so it would attract the reindeer and show them the way to his house and the oatmeal was a treat for the reindeer because they would be hungry.  It was just too damn cute watching him shake the stuff out in the parking lot.  There was a neighbor out there smoking and she was just smiling at him doing it...too damn cute.  

I got my iPod for Christmas - my sister got engaged...lol.  Which is cool for her. SHe is right on schedule...college, job, guy, marriage...will probably have the required 2.3 kids and a nice house in a few years. Yep, I guess all the things she did different with my sister paid off...sigh.  But, I am determined to be less heavy for the wedding so I have another incentive to lose weight.

Bill came over tonight.  He bought J a lot of gifts - too many.  Gave me a new DVD/VCR combo which was very unexpected.  His daughter kept asking what he got me for Christmas in a very weird way.  And, was surprised with my answer - why would she be surprised?  I get the feeling he was going to ask me to marry him although why that would even be an option I don't know.  I haven't seen him in weeks and we don't talk on the phone at all recently though he has called.  

Today I was playing J's Gamecube to help him through a game and I got WAY too into it so I have to be careful...my thumbs hurt!!  lol  But, man, it was fun.

Lots of stuff going on this week with work.  Will be interesting to see how it pans out.  And, I really can't wait til the new year. 

Going to bed or download more songs...lol.  A sample list of what I have downlaoded so far -

Rock the Casbah
American Idiot
You Talk Too Much - Run DMC
Photograph - Nickleback
I Feel For You - Chaka Khan
Let Me Clear My Throat
Unbelievable -EMF
Naked Eyes - Luscious Jackson
Loves Divine - Seal

Yeah, I think that is a good cross of music.  I am downloading a lot of 80's stuff cuz I love the 80's music for some reason.

Well time for me to go to bed!

"event","Well, what a week...between having to finish cleaning up the JP mess and getting Christmas shopping done, it has been hectic.  But, I guess a good hectic. 

On Monday I was having a weird day.  I was driving back from NY on the Merritt and there is this really cool looking tree in Greenwich by one of the exits.  It looks like one you would see that would attack you...lol.  But, cool nonetheless.  Anyway, all of a sudden I get this idea...what must it be like to be a tree??  You can't move...and your arms stick out...don't your arms get tired?  I mean, they are a living thing...lol.  So, anyway, that thought kept me occupied thru the Stamford/Norwalk line.  

Pogo.com - I am addicted nothing more to say there except that my mini has a larger wardrobe than I do and I have named her Pixie...lol.  

Cub Scouts - Well, Jonathan is enjoying himself and I can get into it.  I am talking to more of the moms as I get to know them and that is cool.  And, I talk to some of the guys also.  There is one dad who is really quiet and his son Chris is in our ""den"".  We had to miss going last week due to the PTO meeting from hell and I had been feeling bad.  Well, this dad, Dan, made an ornament for Jonathan so he wouldn't be left out - how sweet was that??  I thanked him a lot...lol.  Then, as he was leaving - he came over and just looked at me (like he can see thru me which makes me jittery...lol) and wished me a happy new year and merry christmas...I stuck out my hand and said the same to him blah blah blah...and he just stood there holding my hand like we were shaking hands...hmmm...innnnnteresting.  Of course, I think he is living with his girlfriend - arent they all ???  lol

Well, here I am, just got out of IM with my coworker David who is also having JP issues.  And, now I am tired tired tired...so, may your days be merry!

"event","Last night Jonathan and I went to go see Bellmore at The Space.  They played an excellent show as usual.  The best part though was when Charlie called for Jonathan to go up on stage.  He said that Jonathan was the coolest 6 yr old he knew and that it had been his birthday yesterday.  So, everyone at the show sang Happy Birthday to him and it was great.  Jonathan was so funny being up there and doing the rock and roll thing with his hand...lol.  Just too cute.

So, on the way home I was HUNGRY.  We stopped at Wendys and got a drink and some fries.  The fries sucked.  They needed some serious salt.  Then I started thinking - and I my have written about this before - most food is ust a conveyance for condiments.  We have to cover most food with SOMETHING.  Sauces on chicken, pasta, hamburgers, hot dogs.  Oh yes, the condiments are what we want!!!  

Toast with butter - I mean, only bland people eat toast with nothing on it.  Pasta, same thing, who would eat pasta with nothing on it??  It was made specifically for a sauce.  Ravioli, same thing.  The only thing that has a marginal out on this rule of thumb is steak.  But even then we use seasoned butters, bacon or steak sauce on it.  Why not just make it politically correct to eat just a condiment.  Yes, I would like an order of ketchup, relish, a little salt, and an order of ranch sauce.  I know, it just doesn't have the same ring to it but hey, just think of how THIN we would all be?!?!?!  I think I will create the condiment diet and become rich and famous.  So, order your stocks in the Heinz company because the base of the diet will be ketchup!!  LOL

Off to play with Jonathan and eat some condiments!!

I like this part of the job...now if I could do this every dayyyy....well, that would be beyond my hopes and dreams for a job.  So much accomplished and so many people helped.  Now, lets hope that this promotion kicks ass on the 30th.  

I am so tired right now - and I should be doing the webpages but, alas, I am not.  Instead I am just reading news, and more news, and more news, and looking at the Subway site.  I am also trying NOT to spend any more money...lol

The PTO meeting was crazy tonight.  I kept waiting to see the fists flailing about. And, of course, my vote was the swing vote...sigh.  They needed 2/3rds of the room to vote to rescind something and I was part of the 1/3rd.  They needed one more person to vote for it to be rescinded.  The parents need to realize that this is for the kids...not to be spiteful and not to take things personally althought I can see one person having some hurt feelings.  And, I went and explained my position to her and her only.  Thankfully, I think she understood which is good because her son and Jonathan are friends. Some days I am SO thankful I am not married.

Well, I guess it is time for bed for me.  Tomorrow is Jonathans PPT and then another full day of running around to the stores which will be nice afer the PPT.  My mom is going with me which is good - since we argued last night online...lol.  I just can't stand to be lectured or have people assuming something that they really have not a whole heck of a lot of knowledge about.  

Now that I am falling asleep...I guess I should go.

"event","Yeah, ok, so the song is Sunday morning - not Wednesday...lol.  Last night was a wee bit stressful.  After a slightly stressful day.  J went to bed early so I started working at about 7:30.  I had to balance the PTO books, and try to make a website for one of my stores.  The books were wild because there was a check that came thru from 2004, and several deposits that no one told me what they were for.  I also think that there is money missing from when someone bounced a check from the fundraiser.  So, I will hav eto check with that person.  

Then came the website.  I had to call HQ to get everyones log in and password (yep, I have top secret info...lol).  So, I thought I would try to do one.  It was really easy and I have decided I will just do them from the stores if I can.  Which means I will have to be online at every store to enter in the prices, hours, etc.  It was pretty cool though - came out good. 

Now today I have to deliver the packets to the stores, and hopefully get 3 stores done.  I don't have time for all of this because I still have to finish the packets in the office.  But, at least Laurie will help with the copies and I can get out of there by 9:15 maybe - maybe - if Wayland doesnt side track me.

So, last night I got to talk to my aunt and to Dennis for a little but mainly it was alllll work.  Plus, I got off a little early and straightened up the house a little.  That made me feel better.  

Ok, well, off to shower land...have a great day!

"event","It is Monday.  I don't want to work, I have too much stuff to do and I am NOT feeling well.  My voice is shot and I am coughing up crap.  It pisses me off.  I do NOT have time for this right now.  

And, of course, I am reading a book AGAIN.  I love this book but it makes me melancholy for something I haven't had yet.  It is called ""Nights In Rodanthe"" and this book is excellent.  But, it just makes me....sad?  Not depressed, just melancholy is more like it.  Kind of shows how life can throw stuff at us when we least expect it - both love and death.  Yah, way too deep for a Monday morning where all I want is to be laying here snuggling.  

Damn, 7:00am comes fast when you can't sleep.  I have been up since 6:00am thinking about where I should go for work today....I am thinking NY since the weather seems ok.  Ahhh, NY, on a Monday.  If my work wasn't by calendar month I would wish for 2 weeks of heavy kick ass snow so I could just stay home...lol.  

On a brighter note - I have two projects going at work that need to be pretty much in a positive state by the end of the week so that should be interesting.  One project is getting the stores set up for a customer appreciation day at the end of the month to take advantage of a royalty free day.  The other is checking on advertising materials and the state of the gift card at stores in my area.  Of course, I have to check my stores too - not just Melinda's.  And, I get all the free Subway I want for me and my family...lol.  

Ok, so my mantra today?  I have come so far - be proud.  Last night I was reminded of the time when Randy and I didn't have enough money for a Christmas tree so we faked one up on the wall with garland and lights.  And, all I kept thinking was MY GOD I have come so far.  I am not the same person I was back then - not at all.  Although experiences like him have made me who I am today.  Stronger, more independent (but wasn't I always??), more able to see thru the bullshit and to walk away when I don't like the bullshit.  You can love a person but hate the bullshit.  And, with him, by the time I walked away, I didn't even love him.  And with J's father - no feeling whatsoever except disgust...lol.  Yep, child support is late and I expected nothing more or less than it to be that way.  I am sure his wife is demanding some sort of big present that will suck up all of his money instead of sending a small amount here for his son.  I mean, hello, Jonathans birthday is this week.  Not that the asshole cares.

On a very bright note - I forgot that this is a five week paycheck and makes me realize that HEY!  I didn't really screw with the budget, there was just an extra week in there.  So, I get paid for 5 weeks, my Christmas bonus, and hopefully my expense check which is about 500...and then if child support ever shows up, another 246.  So, I should be on excellent footing for the 1st.  That lightens my soul.  Gives me room to breath because I don't like to be tight on money.

Ok, my son just came in and we have been snuggling and goofing around which makes me smile.  

Time to get up!!

Have a great day!

But, it is mostly just touch up, like turning on the dishwasher, opening some mail, cleaning off the table, picking up after Jonathan (which is a full time job itself I swear).  I got the garbage together now just have to take it out.

I even made a decadent breakfast of mashed potatoes and shrimp - now now, I know it SOUNDS gross but it is actually very good.  Last time I did it over rice and it was excellent.  I put together the instant mashed potatoes (sour cream and onion ones) and before I microwaved it I sliced some mozzarella cheese over it and then placed Margaritavilles Jammin Cajun Shrimp over it (just a few).  Then I nuked it for about 9 minutes or so to make sure the shrimp were done...and, OMG, awesome stuff.  The shrimp are covered in a spicy mixture and it helps to further flavor the mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes help in that the shrimp are spicy HOT.  Yummy.

So, now I have a full belly and am typing here before we go to make the gingerbread house again.  I got a different one this time and I like the other one better.  This one is already put together but is a little smaller.  Jonathan decided he wanted just me and him to decorate it and no one else.  It is the first tradition we created as our own little family - God, how sad does that sound??  lol  Just me and Jonathan against the world.  Some days I wonder how on earth can I get this job done?  Am I doing a good job?  Is he really ok without a dad?  Am I going to raise a good man?  And, who is going to show ME how to be a good parent?  All of this is just too deep for me today.  

My moms birthday is on Tuesday and I have no idea what to get her.  None whatsoever.  We are going out to dinner today at 4pm at the Rustic Oak.  I don't care for it there for some reason.  I think it is just too - hmmm, rustic??  LOL  I think it is a little romantic and I hate going there with no significant other.  

Isnt it strange?  I really want to clean the bathroom today - like, who ever thinks ""Hey, I really want to clean my bathroom""  ???   LOL   Wow, I just looked at the weather and there are flurries/snow forecast for 3 or 4 days this week.  I need to get my ass to NY and get those stores done! 

Well, it has hit the witching hour of 11:00am so I have to go decorate the gingerbread house.  Maybe I will make the lasagna today also.  I want to paint the house too but that will have to wait til after Christmas - I know I am getting gift cards so it will help to allow me to buy what I want.  

Also, to all of my friends that read this.  Thank you for being there for me.  And, I hope that you all get what you want for Christmas and out of life.  I love you guys!!!

So, today, why so blue?  I don't know.  I was jonesing for a day off - with snow so it won't count against me.  And here it is and I have the blues.  And, I hate feeling like this.  Some times when I am on here my heart pounds so hard and I am not sure why.  I play the damn pogo games like my life depends on it sometimes...and sometimes I think it does.  It keeps me from doing something stupid I guess...or thinking too much.  So, I just keep playing and playing and playing...and playing.  Winning lots of tokens to buy my pogo mini stuff...  I have named her Pixie.  

Well, I have also been buying Christmas gifts online - it makes life easier.  And I use my credit cards to buy so I can keep track easier and not go over budget - or my credit limit...lol.  

I really need a hug today...and I will not be getting one...and that sucks!!  Raaahhhh, yeah, pissy mood...sigh.  Months ago when I met Bill, it was weird...I saw a very nice man, with a house and a nice yard in a great community and was like YES!!  This is it!! The dream!!  Woohoo....uh, ya ok.  NOT!!!!!!  I am still stuck here on the fourth floor with no back yard no dog no room.  Unfortunately I liked the dream more than the man - and for that, I feel bad.  But, my GOD, the house is filthy!  I know I am not the best housekeeper - but man, I have my limits.  He apparently has none.  GROSS!!!  I want someone who will bring me to a higher standard...not wallow in substandard conditions.

Tomorrow is the craft fair and I don't want to go.  I have to run the kitchen with a whole bunch of people I don't like...lol.  And, I hope to God that this chick got change to run the kitchen with.  

Ok, well, I have bitched enough....now I will tell you the best part of the week hands down.  Having a wonderful dinner with Dennis at Tony and Lucilles on Wooster Street.  The food was excellent...mmmm, the tomato and mozzarella....yes, even though they left me with onion breath (sorry about that)....it was really to die for...and then the manicotti...HUGE...and delicious.  I got to take a bite of the lasagna and the sausage was to die for.  Excellent conversation, excellent food...and we took our time eating...just a second to none dinner.  

Ok, well, now that I have NOT done laundry that I should have done..now I have to do it in the morning...sigh.  Oh well...that will work I guess.  I am determined to be in a better mood now.  And, I am determined to win this other badge in Turbo 21, I already got the one in Mahjongg Garden...sad, oh so sad...lol.  

Ok, I am off....

"event","Wow, cold it was today - but it was awesome.  The snow, perfect.  The cold felt refreshing for awhile.  I think that is because I didn't HAVE to go out in it.  

Lots of stuff going on this month - a lot of fun stuff.  But, this is my week as it breaks down.

Monday - J Karate
Tuesday - Home Owners Assoc Meeting
Wednesday - PTO meeting and J karate
Thursday - Meeting in AM at school and an afternoon marketing meeting in Waterbury
Friday - Dinner with Dennis????
Saturday - Running the kitchen at the craft fair and J moving up to Orange belt in karate!!  Bellmore concert at night.
Sunday - I am sure there is something going on...probably housework!!  lol

Then start all over again...lol

Already started on Christmas so that is cool.  I think some of the family is NOT going to be trading presents this year due to money issues.  Which is fine but I think even just a small token of something would be nice to do... it is not what you give but the thought behind it (I personally want the BIG present...lol).  

The things I would like for Christmas?  Hmmm....not quite sure.  Jewelry would be nice...yes, I am getting into jewelry, not sure why.  Nothing fancy really...I really want something with green tourmaline.  I found this awesome ring a few years ago that I loved that had diamonds and green tourmaline and I kept saying that I would put away the money to get it...it was to treat myself.  And, I never did.  Too many other things taking precedence.  This year though, I may treat myself to a different present.  

Well, Bill is still trying and trying.  And it is still not working working.  Let's face it - when there is NO attraction, there is NO attraction.  But, man, when it burns hot, there is no stopping it usually.  And, well, this train has never left the station for burning lust...lol.  It is stuck on the platform of friends.  

Well, getting a wee bit tired now and I have a long day ahead of me...

May your days be merry and bright...lol

"event","Ho ho a fucking ho...lol.  Well, that time of year is here.  I am usually pretty good about holidays and try not to stress too much but this year, well, I am plain old avoiding thinking about it.  Too many people to buy for.  And, I LOVE to shop lately though I have refrained from doing so due to budget concerns.  

This yar for Christmas I just want a few small things - and Home Depot gift certificates...lol.  Oh wow, I just closed my eyes and fell asleep for a minute - til the snore woke me up I think....lol

Ok, I am off to sleep.  Sorry to anyone who was looking for me tonight - I wanted to watch tv and got caught up in it.  

Great day overall though - got some NY stores done woohoo.  Tomorrow is going to be a pain as I cal it - lets hope I am wrong...lol

Toodles!!

"event","Do you ever wonder why you feel the way you do?

Do you ever wonder how in the hell you got where you are?

What forms us?  Who we are.

First, let me explain that my mother says I ""think too much"" and at times I agree.  It is NOT something that I am very proud of.  And, I try to ""think"" less.  One thing that I have always been adamant about is a ""title"".  I always need to know where I stand - at work, at home, in a relationship.  And, I don't know why because it is really not that important and it is much easier without one.  There are titles that we can not escape once we are in them such as daughter, mother, sister, relative among others.  

There are others in which others place us or we place ourselves.  In school, for the most part for me it was ""fat girl"".  Which was traumatizing for a long time, and some days it still is (like when you can't fit into your ""fat jeans""  lol).  Then it was ""star"" at work because I give 200% to work usually.  (hmmm, had to stop and watch Grey's Anatomy and laugh...lol). Yeah, I am short attention span gal now...lol.  

Anyway, I look at how some titles have affected my life.  And, how, as an adult, it is high time I change the outcome of some of them.  The main title I had when I was little was ""Daddy's Girl"".  That has not been in play for a very long time. And, well, I am so mad at him for treating me like shit.  I have surpassed feeling bad and am now ANGRY.  He has not only left me in the dirt, but his other three kids also.  And, they were younger when it happened.  Of course, they had a step father who loved them very much to the best of my knowledge - I have one that I constantly bump heads with...lol. When I think of all the times he called me fat, ugly, stupid and told me I would amount to nothing - well, fuck him.  Just because you are a parent - it does not give you the right to torture your child.  

As I look back on how he has influenced the way I think about myself, I could really cry.  The low self esteem during my teens and early twenties was the worst.  I married a man because I thought for sure that no one else would ever ever love me.  Then to find out he was gay and an alcoholic to boot - well, HELLO!  But, I grew from that experience.  For a long time I was the main support and I got through a lot of tough situations that no one should ever have to go through.  And, when you are trying to be the best you can be and someone is just holding you down - that is the worst part.  I work hard to get ahead - no one will ever drag me down again.

I was meant for more - more what I am not sure.  I guess I have looked back with regret the last few days.  Too many wrong paths taken - too many consequences.  I guess we learn from our mistakes but, well, that just sucks.  Don't get me wrong - all is not horrible and I am not in a depressive state.  I know it could be MUCH worse.  I could be on assistance or be living with someone in a horrible relationship.  My son could have worse issues than he does.  I KNOW it could be worse.  But, I just want it to be better.

But, what will that take?  I am not really happy with where I live but it is ok for now...and I have furniture, credit cards, and extras that many families do without.  (Of course I have the bills to go with them..lol).  The relationsip front is kinda strange right now.  But, not having a ""label"" is good.  And, well, Bill...I feel bad for him but it is just not right.  I have a good time with Den and that is how I like it.  

Ahhh, the elusive sleep again.  Of course, I knew that drinking soda would NOT help the sleep situation...lol.  At least I have cable...lol.  

Well, enough of this...and off to sleepyland.  Thanks for listening to me vent - if anyone is still reading this - it seems like forever since I really wrote anything here.

You tend to find yourself lucky - both in business and in life.
And while being wealthy is nice, you enjoy sharing your abundance with others.
You put your luck to good use: you are very ambitious and goal oriented.
Often times, you get over excited and take on more than you can manage.

Your strength: Your ability to make your own luck

Been going crazy with the school and Jonathan.  I have a meeting this morning and I am not thrilled about it.  But, it better get some things taken care of.  They are not doing right by me or my child and that is going to stop.  But, of course, I know that in the meeting I will be getting emotional and I am just not in the mood for that.  I am happy today - though a bit frazzled about work - and I want to maintain that.  

Love life - hmmmm, well have had glimpses of one lately which is very nice...lol.  Dinner, drinks, great conversation, and those awesome kisses and hugs.  I could kiss him all day - of course we have had almost two years of practice so we should know each other by now.  

Work - busy and I have been given a new marketing project for next month.  Woohoo, they are finally realizing that they gave the job first to the wrong person...lol.  He dropped the ball and now I am thrown into it and it will work out great.  Hopefully this will lead to less stores and more marketing and meetings - just what I like.  

Ack!!  Running late now so gotta go...maybe more later if I get the time.  I know Michael - I should write about what I feeeeeeel...and I will later...lol.

Ciao and kisses

"event","Lately there is something going on.  Either I am tired and don't come online, or else I stay awake til all hours of the night playing on pogo.com.  I think my happy balance was going on before...lol.  I need sleep.  WOrk is hard and I am getting so much done but I need to be awake before I crash someone's computer.  That would be bad, very bad.  It seems to have happened to most of my coworkers already and I have come close.  Even our IT guy has had computers crash on him or had cases where they just would not update and then they have to buy a new computer.  Incredible.  All to be able to sell gift cards...lol.

One thing that is cool is teaching the owners and staff how to process the gift cards.  I have a test card that I use but we always run one through ""live"" to make sure it works.  I tried to cheat and see if I could get loyalty points on the card but I couldnt...lol.  Oh well.  

Oh Lord, I am tired.  And falling asleep.  So, I will forego talking about the huge bruise on my elbow from a car door.  Oh well...having to feel you against my ass wil have to wait...lol.  Just call me GRACE!

"event","Wow, how busy can I be???  Lots going on and I havent written one word!!  Where to begin.

Lots and lots of work - did I say A LOT of work?

Still working on getting this condo in order

PTO - I volunteered for what again??  LOL - Actually this is going good so far.  I just got the statement this week so now i have to figure out how to balance the check book.  But, I get a weird feeling that the last Treasurer did something with the books.  He is acting very suspicious and makes lots of apologies and excuses.  Too many.  So, now I feel like I have to watch my back.

Injuries - Need I say more?  Call me Grace...lol.  Hurt my foot/ankle, fractured my hand/pinkie finger, and broke a rib.  All of this happened in a two day span of time.  What was the universe trying to tell me?  

Worked for Bill this past weekend - interesting study in the carnival life.  The people who run the booths are every day people because they only do the fairs and events they want to do.  The people who run the rides travel with the carnival because they travel with the equipment.  So, there are two totally different classes of people there.

Love life - what love life?   huh?  I am ready to put out an APB for one!  LOL  Ok, and for some hot intercourse...woohooo

Oh man, well, it is late and this is short but it is just a synopsis for the books ready to come...lol

So, to my readers, Laura (love ya girlfriend!!) and Michael ( my brother!), and maybe even Dennis (hmmm, my what???  LOL) hugs and kisses to all!!

"event","Wow, September already...where is the time going to?  Jonathan started first grade.  I started a new month at work that is filled with opportunity (see, taking a positive tac on it..lol).  And, I am off and running...I have the most stores done as far as computer updates and have a decent amount of stores done over all.  But, I have to keep up a heavy pace to get half done by the 15th to make my bonus.

Next week is the child support hearing.  And, so far, I am keeping busy enough to keep my mind off of it.  But, I need to start packing because I will not have enough time this weekend.  I will be helping out Bill with the concession stand - he needed another QFO (Qualified Food Operator) so I am it.  He is going to pay me damn good too.  And, maybe I will lose even more weight being in that damn hot trailer...lol. Oh well, the money is good....now I just have to find my license and make a copy of it...lol.

So, the week is full with work work work...and karate...and cleaning.  I finally put my damn desk together yesterday and after throwing only 2 parts on the floor in frustration!!  lol  Only did 3 loads of laundry...I wanted to do some more bedding but, well, that is put off til tomorrow now. 

Long day at work and I miss karate...I HAVE to make it on Thursday.  Today was just rotten for schedules.

Well, now that it has taken me almost forever to write this, I should go to sleep.  Thinking of some ones kisses on my lips - and other places - like MY ASS for sending me a pic of the middle finger today...lol.  But, I sent one back...lol.

Nighters....

"event","Wow, the destruction and stories are heart wrenching.  Stupid people being killed in a storm that they were told to flee from.  For some reason, I have NO sympathy for them - they were told to leave and thought they could ride it out and they were proved wrong.  But, there are cases where people COULDN'T move and they died, and that is horrible because if only people would help each other, and the government could do its Storm Preparedness correctly, then these folks could still be alive.  

And, looting, come on now.  GET A FUCKING JOB AND PAY FOR THE SHIT!  I am not prejudice BUT, I thought it was slightly funny that all the pictures of looting and not one white person.  I don't think I even saw a Hispanic person. And, a lot of them are kids.  I am sorry but if Jonathan came home with a bunch of wet stuff I knew wasn't his, I would whip his behind so hard and so fast he wouldn't know what hit him.  

I am so tired of this type of bullshit.  People need to get their acts together.  And, there are better ways for the government to do this than welfare and social security.  I am tired of hearing about people getting money that they are not really qualified for.  And, tired of hearing about little kids giving birth.  You reap what you sow.  Parents better wake up and smell the coffee real soon or else we have a whole new generation of losers on the way.  

Well, enough ranting and raving.  

This week I have had two family members pass away.  First, my Great-Aunt Pearl passed.  Then, the day of her funeral (Monday) my Great-Uncle Jimmy passed away.  I was not necessarily close to Pearl, but, I was close to my Uncle Jimmy.  I remember after I gave birth to Jonathan - they came up within a few weeks.  We were talking about how I was going to support Jonathan and the plans I had.  I told them that it was rough but that Jonathan would have what he needed and said that I was going to buy him his first pair of shoes soon.  My uncle Jimmy took me aside and gave me $25 to buy J a pair of good shoes.  I cried.  And, I thanked him.  I know if I had asked him for money, he would have freely given it.  He had a very big heart.

We used to live next door to my Uncle Jimmy and his family.  There would be some cook outs and I remember going over to play cards and making jokes about my Aunt Jackies cooking skills.  He had enormous talent doing wood working.  He had a tremendous sense of humor and showed us all lots of love.  Even though I hadn't seen him in a long time, I will miss him and I will always remember him - he was a favorite.  He died after a long bout with cancer so I know he is now in a better place hanging with Grandma and Grandpa.  

Now, I wonder who the third is going to be.  There is only one member of that generation of the family left and that is Great-Uncle Joe.  I am not close to him at all and I don't know why.  

Last night I had karate and I threw up during class.  Well, not IN class but tried to nonchalantly stroll out of the room and then ran to the bathroom.  Yuck, that bathroom is so nasty there was no way I was going to kneel on the floor - NO WAY.  And, everyone knows, throwing up while standing up is well, gross.  How many times did I start to clean off the seat only to start throwing up again?  lol  Thank goodness for the gum  bought the other day!

Today has been long but I accomplished quite a bit.  Tomorrow starts school and I do not feel ready.  Crap, I forgot I have to cut J's hair....well, I better go do that!  No rest for the weary!

Love to all who cared enough to read this far...lol

"event","Wow, what a friggin week. SO much going on inside my head right now.  Too much stuff.  Work is crazy and will be that way for another few months.  

Starting karate for six months - and am feeling good about that.  Although tonight was just such a bad night that I didn't go and of course I feel guilty.  But, at least while Jonathan had class I went into the other room and practiced my one pinion and then uhhh, ohe of the positions...lol.  I like doing kicks, not sure why.  So, at least I was able to practice a little.

Work, ah work.  I guess it is like chocolate.  When you have some - it is great.  But, have TOO much and it is like blech.  Well, I am at the puke point.  Actually this morning my nerves were so worked up that I DID throw up.  Well, dry heaved - for about 5 minutes straight.  Besides the numbness in my arms, I felt better.  

Grabbed a portable CD-ROM and off to the stores I went.  And, of course, couldnt update any of them.  Pissed me off.  They all need more RAM (well, doesnt everyone?? LOL).  Sigh.  I love computer work - some days I wish I could just do data entry or something boring like that.  Of course, then my ass would get even bigger!

It is funny though, I am the only consultant who has done any of the 2005 installs on the POS system.  So, of course, when the guys realized this, now I am the one they call for help!  Not that I mind - makes me feel needed and smart...lol.  I know my stuff and am damn proud of it.  Not afraid of any computer either.  

I LIKE that I am smart.  Though some times I just don't feel it.  And, no, I am not putting myself down.  I guess just because some times I can leap before I look.  I speak before I really think at times.  And, well, there are times I just don't do the things I am supposed to do - with no apparent reason why.  I have totally pissed off JP AGAIN.  And, when he asked why I didn't make my calls, my answer was ""I don't know"" and well, I really DIDN'T know why I didn't do it.  I think as I leave my last store for the day my mind just goes into a different mode.  Oh well.

Now, I have a great opportunity to move to Guilford, into a house, on a 3/4 acre lot on a dead end street.  This would most likely happen in January if it were to happen at all.  Which I just don't see it happening.  Though I know Jonathan would love it.  At what point do you say, hey, I know this is what my child wants and what would most likely be great FOR him - another great school system, a house, he could get a dog, etc.  BUT, I would be a user if I did it.  And, I am definitely NOT that.  I am proud of what I have accomplished on my own.  And, intend to keep working even though I wouldn't have to if I moved.  Well, I wouldn't have to keep working here.  

Well, time to go to sleep I think, I am exhausted - again.

I miss my friends and family.  I miss my karate.  I miss spending time with my son.  And, well, I miss a lot of things.  When did this all happen?  

Hi yahhhh!!

"event","Some thing has happened.  Most likely it was nothing but it has me freaked out enough that I can't sleep.  I didn't sleep well and I was wide awake at 5:30 this morning.  I know I am tired but my mind just won't shut off.  

I know this doesn't make sense - and I hope it never does.  

Do you think I can get a half an hour of sleep?  Highly doubtful."

"event","My hearts is torn and confused
With feelings that just won't diffuse
I know my love for you will never end
But there are other parts I have to tend

To have the stability that one craves
To have the love at the end of the day
To have a shoulder to cry on
And an arm to lean on
To be the special person in some ones life
And, no, I am not talking about being a wife

Just some one who will care
And some one who will share
When you have had a crappy day
And all you want to say 
Is ""Fuck it all""
And put your fist through the wall

The person you put your arms around
When you want to be found
To know when you need a kiss
I am first on the list
Just to know that you care
And that you will be there
Would be enough for me
And no other would I see

He offers me the stability of caring
Of a home, a shoulder, and sharing
He offers us the third to make a ""real"" family
But with my blinders on, it is only you I see
You are in my soul
And I need you in my life to be whole

Is it fair to any of us?
It's not fair to him
For you are the one I fantasize about
You are the one whose kisses draw me in


Ahhh crap, it is late and I can't finish this.  Do I even want to finish it?  Who wins?  No one.  Time for bed.

Me"

"event","Wow, an awesome busy busy week.  Meeting upon meeting, driving to NY constantly...it was crazy.  But, started karate and that was awesome!  I am still sore from the push ups but that is about it.  The rest is a good sore.  

Took J to a fair yesterday and it was fun.  My sister and I ate TOO much!  We just made our way down the line of food booths sharing whatever we got...lol.  It was too funny.  We had: onion rings, fried dough, fried oreos, Thai chicken and rice, a hot fudge sundae and I had some fried seafood ravioli...YUM!  Oink oink.  Jonathan just had some of our fried dough and two chocolate ice cream cones...lol.  He went on some rides and was hysterical on them.  

We played the mandatory 10 games and won too many small prizes...lol.  But, got two great t-shirts for Jonathan very cheap and they are cute.  Just over all had a great time.  

Well, was talking to Dennis this morning and he has got me all worked up.  Ok, so it was ME doing all the working up.  Mmmm, miss him and the sex so bad.  I miss sex period.  LOL  Although I can do many things to get myself off it is just not the same, obviously.  Miss him pulling my hair, biting my neck, and just being together.  Mmmm, and well, you just can't give a vibrator head...lol.  Not that I have tried...I have heard enough jokes...LOL.  Hands on my body, tongue on my neck and shoulders, bosy to body.  Slap that ass man!  

Anyway, well, now it is time to get back to reality and get dressed, go grocery shopping, and do ooodles of laundry.  Not to mention clean...yuck.  LOL  Actually we havent been here too much so the house is reasonably ok.  Just a lot of straightening and dusting.  

This week is going to be another crazy week with meetings.  Monday it is a meeting with the PTO president to switch the treasurer files to my computer.  Tuesday it is work late and then karate.  Wednesday it is work late with a meeting from 3-6 in the Bronx.  Thursday it is work a little late and then karate.  Then Friday?  Hmmm, gee, work late to finish up my stores so that I can take Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday off of next week to spend with Jonathan before he goes back to school.  I think I will need the time off too.  

Ok, now to go get started and to stop talking about it...lol.  

May your day be filled with sunshine and awesome sex (if you are Dennis, sex with me only...LOL).

"event","Ok, so, I may not be on here too much this week - or, I may need to vent and be on A LOT!  

Monday - Had a meeting at the Milford Mall with the GM so I figured, hey, while I am here I will do the evaluation and do the update on their computer. WRONG MOVE.  The eval went fine - they passed.  But, the computer work that was supposed to take 30 minutes too over 140 minutes!!  I was on the phone with the Tech Dept at HQ trying to get it fixed.  I knew I was knee deep in shit when HE started to swear. Apparently there was something either wrong with my CD or with their computer.  I am hoping to hell that it was their compuer because I will be in NY tomorrow updating another one.  

But, after the morning from hell, the afternoon was a piece of cake.

Today/Tuesday -  Another crazy running around day.  To Westchester and back and computer issues from my owners to troubleshoot in the afternoon.  Toaster Ovens to update....crazy, just crazy.  But, nothing too tough to handle.

J had karate tonight and that went awesome with the exception that him and a few others in class were restless.  When he is in class with this one little boy, and the other boy acts up, so does Jonathan.  At least today he tried to move away from him so that he would be left alone.  

We got home, and it was time for J to get to bed and I came on here...well, online.  And, had the joy of paying bills...whoohooo.  Getting paid has its advantages sometimes..and other times, well, it sucks.

Tomorrow is another long day - leaving early to NY, then coming home, making supper and going back out for the PTO meeting.  I may quit before I begin on that.  I know it sounds horrible but there is so much cat fighting that I do NOT want to be in the middle of it.  I wrote kind of a nasty letter to the old PTO president because she has been hounding me about what I should do, what I should say, blah blah blah....just too much.  

Anyway...gee, I feel bad that this entry is mostly bitch bitch bitch...lol.  Just in a bitchy tired mood!!  And, I miss Dennis...oh man, do I miss him.  Yeah, I know if you are reading this Den, your head just swelled up!!  lol  

Ok, night to all!!  Love ya!

"event","Well, J graduated to yellow belt today!  I am so proud of him.  It was funny at the graduation ceremony though because he could NOT stand still.  He was SO tired!!  When we got home he took a loooong nap thank goodness - I only wish I did.

Talked to Bill and he is coming over tonight after work which is around 9:30.  I just want to sleep - not entertain.  But, he said he has something for Jonathan because he graduated.  See?  How nice is that?  Makes me feel like a shithead.  So, needless to say I will not be online playing Pogo games or talking to my aunt Debbie tonight.  Would MUCH rather be fucking Dennis madly...lol.

Right now, I should be getting ready - and I just can't - just can't.  I look like shit because it was so humid out today and my hair is looking, ugh!  I think my make up has smudged around my eyes and I am tired.  Not a good picture eh?  RAHHHHHHHH...lol

Decided to take up karate like Jonathan.  They are starting a new Adult class soon and I will be in that.  I am sure I will move thru the ranks fairly quickly because I have been watching Jonathan and know a lot of the kicks and moves.  But, watching some of the people putting together these moves is crazy!  Kind of like a nice choreograph..and Lord knows, it is hard for me to line dance...lol.  

Well, after Bill leaves, I have determined I am going straight to bed!  No computer, no nothing!  I am tired and need my sleep.  Unless you want to pull my hair and kiss my neck!  LOL  Oh yeah....

"event","Well, long time no write.  I have been so busy and have just not had the time.  Lots of stuff to talk about.  Working hard, making good money, cleaning up the condo, karate, meetings, and some sort of a personal life I guess.  Odd though, the ""better"" it gets the more confusing it gets.  I am beginning to think I just need to have that one special ""friend"" and forget the rest....sigh.

Went to lunch with Dennis on Thursday and had an awesome time as usual.  And, I got to make out with him!!  Wooohooo....I love the way he kisses me.  Great conversation, great food, great man.

Went out with Bill (new Bill, not old Bill) and well, it was ok.  He is so very sweet, very nice, gets a long great with J, has a place in Guilford(nice town), and has his own business part time so would be a great provider.  So, what is wrong?  Hmmm, can you say, he is not someone else????  lol  I know that is mean but I dont mean it to be.  

The one main factor that is holding me back is that I thought he was 46 (which is about what he looks like).  Well, he says, gee, I took my ad off the website and, well, I realized that it had my age wrong (Uh huh, yeah, ok).  I am really FIFTY FOUR.  Now, that is almost as old as my mom and older than my step father.  Reduced shelf life...lol...plus he smokes (EWWWWWWWW).  

Well, today is J's graduation to yellow belt and he is going to sparring so I have to get going!  Have an awesome day!

"event","Well, last week I started to watch more of what I ate and ate differently - eating less and better for me.  This week, now that my period is here, it should be even easier.  Hopefully.  Yes, it seems like everyone is off to lose weight this week also.  Lots of my friends have picked this month as THE month to start.  So, I am on the band wagon too.  The stomach has GOT to go!!  lol

So, here I am waiting for the car to be done and I am fighting the temptation.  I think that Cheerios are going to be my saving grace like they were a few months ago.  Pop a few and they expand in the stomach to fill you up.  Lots of veggies and fruits too.  I bought a smoothie machine that I am going to put to use.

Also, I am in a good place emotionally and mentally to start.  Frustrated enough but not too much...lol.  And determined to get back on track.  In not feeling well physically, and going through so much with relationships and all that, there have been things that have gotten lost on the way.  Organization of the house, taking care of myself like getting pedicures and getting my hair cut and colored.  I need to get back on track. 

I have to make a schedule...lol.  Before I never had anything to do after I got home except for the usual stuff.  Now, I have Homeowners Assoc meetings, PTO meetings, Karate 3 times a week, and then soccer will be coming up.  Incredible.  I think I am trying to be Wonder Woman and I dont think it is going to work...lol.  

Ok, time for a shower in case they are gonna call for the car!

Have a most awesome day!

"event","What a day.  Car is in the shop - needs 800 dollars in repairs for tires and stuff.  Then since my computer died yesterday, now I need a new computer cost $1200.  Need a new rolling cart - 200 dollars.  I think Musco is ready to kill me.  BUT, the best part is, Wayland crashed his car again in the recent past and the front end is ALL screwed up.  So, at least I am still far behind him.

Meetings today were interesting.  But, they would come up with a great concept, we would get some details started.  And then nothing else is going to be followed up on because we have NO TIME.  Everyone got their store assignments and I have 47 stores.  Actually, most of us do across the board.  So, lots and lots of money to be made this month - even with store openings!  YAY!!

It was sad, we could not even coordinate lunch.  We were laughing that if we cant coordinate lunch and all get out of the building at once, how on earth is the company running?  My answer was, well, look how inefficient this all went - that is THIS company!

I went back on my meds yesterday.  I could feel my TMJ tighteing up and the area in front of my ear was swollen again showing I am VERY VERY stressed.  And, it was worse today.  Mainly because of work - actually I am sure it is all because of work.  Once I saw the schedule and we started going over everything - then finding out I wont have my own computer for a while - sucks!  Oh well, just another day gone by.

Jonathan and I had a great night.  I had a very bad headache so I laid on the couch and tried not to fall asleep and was rubbing his back.  Then I read him his book on New York City he picked out.  I love reading him that book.  We have talked about visiting all the sites in the book and keep all of the fliers and pictures along with the book in a special place as a memento.  I think that would be neat to keep.  Just all the terrorists must stay away!

Ok, time for bed....snore snore...I am tiiiired

Nighters all

"event","This has been a great week.  GOt a decent amount of work done, got personl stuff done, and got to be with friends and family quite a bit.  

Went to the casino on Wednesday night for supper and some fun.  Even better was getting to see Dennis and hang out for a while.  It was great sitting around the table, the family sharing food and conversation.  The caresses, kisses and touching weren't so bad either.  With Dennis pulling my hair once in a while - it made me horny - lol.  If he had bit my neck....well, it would have been then end...lol.

Today was an awesome day.  It was crazy in the morning - laundry to do, cookies to bake, house to clean, and had to get ready to go!  Crazy crazy crazy.  I was so stressed by the time I got to moms I literally cried.  I felt bad because I wanted to help set up and I got there right at 2:00pm.  After being there for a few minutes,the stress disappeared and we had a great time.  Everyone got along, there were lots of people there, and it was FUN and funny!  Jonathan had an awesome time and when we got home at around 10, he fell right asleep.  

After most of the people left, my mom, step dad, sister, and some of moms friends were sitting around the table and we decided to play dominoes.  I am getting my own set - it was so much fun.  Of course, it was fun cuz I won!!  LOL  Anyway, overall a great day!

Now, it is late - and I should get going to bed.  No Auntie Debbie on here tonight and no Dennis, so therefore, nothing to do!  

May you all have a most awesome day!

Painted the samples onto the living room and dining room walls today and it is a split decision.  The paint I got for the majority of the room matches my couch perfectly - it is the SAME exact color.  And the light pink I got is more of a pink/purple...and it is staying...lol.  It looks different and I kinda like it...of course I will prob change it later.  But, for now it suits me.  The main color though...ugh...wont it cleash with it being the same color???  I just dont know...lol

Checking flights for my aunt Debbie to come up for August 20.  It is her brothers birthday and they are surprising him with a party - months before his actual birthday...lol.  So, here we are online - my Aunt Debbie, my sister Lisa, and I - looking for flights.  It will be so cool to be able to hang out with her. 

August is such a busy month!  Lots and lots of different stuff to do.  First, there is lots of work because Mel will still be out of work.  Then the first weekend is a fund raiser at J's karate school and Meliha's wedding shower.  Then the next weekend is the wedding and the J doing karate kicks on tv (lol) and graduating to the next belt level.  He may even go up TWO belts because he is doing so well.  Then Debbie comes down the following weekend and there is Tim's party - I hope I can go see him.  I haven't seen him in about 18 yrs.  Then on Sept 3rd there is my cousins wedding in Maine...YIKES.  

Hmmm, feeelings whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa feeelings.  Ack, who needs em?  LOL  Just kidding...hmmm, am I supposed to write about what I am feeling lately?  Hmmm, well, I think I have been too busy to feel anything except tired.  Oh, BUT, I HAVE been very horny the last week.  Like I can't get enough.  Which is odd.  Wish there was someone to sleep with...lol.  

Hmmm, been feeling:  alone, tired, comfortable, happy, satisfied, patient...and that doesnt even begin to scratch the surface.  I am a Gemini, I can change on a dime...lol.  

Ok, time for a nap...lol.  Hmmmm, more like time to get my ass back in gear.  

Ciao!

"event","Wow, haven't blogged in a few days, or did I??  Been working late and HARD!  Have gotten so much work done in the last few days even I can't believe it!  And, it feels good!!  So far I have about 1K in bonus money coming this month which will help replenish the savings account a little bit.  

I also finally received the last workers comp check for 873.00 yesterday so that is also helping to replenish.  Whew, just when I was starting to think, uh oh.  I like to have a wiiiiide buffer so that if something serious should happen, the money is there.  Like with the water heater.  Although I didn't like spending the money, at least I had it.

Tomorrow I have to go pick up the desk I bought...it was cheap but it matches the decor perfectly and is not too big.  Which, I don't need a huge desk for a laptop anyway.  Finally, an official place for the papers that can accumulate on the dining room table.  

This week has been full of funny stories - from the little kid in karate asking if Jonathans hand was still in my tummy to taking the long way home TWICE this week. Telling an owner in the Bronx he shouldn't burn incense in the store anymore (YUCK!!).  Hanging up on JP only to have him call me today and be all happy and friendly and calling me Philly.  Yeah, Melinda told him yesterday that she will be out til September (like we didn't know that already) so he has realized that MAYBE he better be nice to me...lol.  Lots of weird people in the Bronx which always make me realize just how good I have it and how I need to be proud of myself for accomplishing what most can't.  

Today Jonathan went to karate with Lisa because I was working.  He did AWESOME!  He was sparring with an older kid who has been in at least one tournament and he scored the first point!  He scored 4 points to the other kids 7 points - not bad for his first time out with NO experience.  Mr. Montgomery (sheesh, does he even have a first name?) says he is a natural.  Great, now we will have karate 3 times a week and soccer one time a week....oh boy!  Maybe I just need to rethink the soccer thing.  

Tomorrow will be a great day off with Jonathan.  We need to get a lot of stuff done around the house since I haven't been here.  Laundry first, cleaning, grocery shopping - you never think about paper towels and napkins til you don't have any - lol.  Also, going to do a Bronx Zoo membership I think - the deal sounds good and we can visit multiple times with other friends in tow.  So, the zoo waits another week or so.

Ok, 9:19 and I am exhausted.  The bed is calling me!!!  

Love you all....lol

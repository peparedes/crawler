I prayed for everyone last night, so I hope that everyone's day was alright today.  Don't worry, we'll get through this year.

"event","""I lay as this sacrifice to this unholy altar
The evil inside Satan; Satan sit and watch me die
Demented screams, tortured beings, where's your hope,
where's your smile, there was none
Life of lies gone, gone no more
So upset, so distraught, I'm sorry, I'm Sorry... I live for the Lord
Watch me die no longer I am alive
My purpose no more... I live for Christ
Dead to sin, only begin, imagine what's for Soldier of Christ
Changed with a new beginning, blood of the lamb, white washed sins
Forgive me God for all of these years of my transgressions
I cry renewed, I cry renewed This world means nothing to me
My life changed I now see Crucified with Christ,
the old self left with the rest of this world, rest of this world
Kneel before his throne, home now from this journey
I see my father in his arms finally found
This path I have chosen is hard but I'll make it with my saviors help
I survive this hell till the end I'll stand true
Eternal life, ready for the fight that the evil brings
No giving in... I'm free
The fire burns engulfing all the victims in it's path, no where to run
Over taken they give in to surrender to the Lord once, and for all
No longer keeping quiet, no longer standing still,
no longer giving in, no longer going back
I stand strong praying for love always to be in my heart""

I'm sorry for the confusion between me and girls at the church. Please know that I'm not trying to start a dating relationship with any of them, nor am I doing this so-called ""flirting"". If you have a problem with me going on a walk with one of them, know that we talk about heaven and the like. I'm also sorry to the girl if I'm stirred up any emotions, but those of you who people have talked about us, we've talked about this subject and we should be all cool with it. If anybody wants to talk about it, please talk to me. Don't talk to anybody else about it, please talk to me. Thank you. 
Sincerely, Evan

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Speaking&nbsp;about comparing....</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>""I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.&nbsp; The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God."" </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>Romans 8:18-21 NIV</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>""That's why I don't think there's any comparison between the present hard times and the coming good times. The created world itself can hardly wait for what's coming next.&nbsp; Everything in creation is being more or less held back.&nbsp; God reins it in until both creation and all the creatures are ready and can be released at the same moment into the glorious times ahead.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the joyful anticipation deepens.""</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>Romans 8:18-21 (The Message: Remix)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>""In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons:"" </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>Hebrews 12:4-5a NIV</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>""In this all-out match against sin, others have suffered far worse than you, to say nothing of what Jesus went through-all that bloodshed! So don't feel sorry for yourselves. Or have you forgotten how good parents treat children, and that God regards you as <EM>his</EM> children?""</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>Hebrews 12:4-5a (The Message: Remix)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are all really hott 'cause it's something to look forward to when we're struggling, thinking that when we're struggling, we haven't yet begun to suffer so badly as to bleed like our Jesus did for us.&nbsp; So next time you think you're struggling with sin, or with temptation, or with persecution, just think of the glory that will soon be revealed to us.&nbsp; Look ahead to the rewards you'll have in heaven if you just pass up this one temptation and stuff.&nbsp; Just think.</DIV></DIV>"

School was easy as anything, two open-notes exams.

Then cut the grass for an hour and met Julia and Laura at the pool to hang out for almost 3 hours, then afterwards Kate and Julia showed up in my front yard and I came out and talked to them.  Then Kate and I walked Julia home to meet Laura and Anna, which I was very excited to see Anna.

Then I walked Kate home and we stopped in her front yard and sat down and her mom greeted us and left the front door open so we talked for a really long time about our relationships with God and our relationships with people and how hard it is to live up to the standards that we set for ourselves and that Jesus set for us, but it'd be so awesome if we could live up to it.  Then we prayed. :-D.

Dear Julia,
Thanks for hanging out with me
at the pool today.  And for coming
to see me in my front yard.  And 
once again, I'm ecstatic that you 
have those feelings about things 
at the pool; like little things like 
wearing your shorts in.  It's awesome.
I respect that.  And please tell 
me if you want to change anything.
I love you.  We should hang out 
this summer a whole lot.  And since
we've already established you're my
pool buddy, we'll just have a 
kickin' time at GCC.  Wonderful.
Love, Evan.

Dear Kate,
Thank you for being you.  You're 
such a beautiful girl and you 
have such a beautiful heart.  Thank 
you for being gentle, even with people
like Jackson Midget and Jack Black.
I thank my God everytime I remember
you in my prayers.  Thank you for
talking to me today, and thank you for
praying with me.  I prayed on the way
home by myself and I thanked Him 
several times for you.  You're amazing.
I love you. 
Love, Evan"

And my heart along with that
To live not for myself
But yet for God, somebody said
Do you know what you are getting yourself into

When I finally ironed out
All of my priorities
And asked God to remove the doubt
That makes me so unsure of these
Things I ask myself, I ask myself
Do you know what you are getting yourself into

I'm getting into you 
Because you got to me, in a way words can't describe
I'm getting into you 
Because I've got to be
You're essential to survive
I'm going to love you with my life

When he looked at me and said
I kind of view you as a son
And for a second our eyes met
And I met that with a question
Do you know what you are getting yourself into

I've been a liar and I'll never amount to
The kind of person you deserve to worship you
You say you will not dwell on what I did but rather what I do you say
I love you and that's what you are getting yourself into

He said, I love you and that's what you are getting yourself into.

Sometimes we fool around too much, 
Cuz' we are a frisky bunch.

You're the money and the bomb, 
But I talk about your mom 
Even though it isn't right. 
Go to Mikey's (Story's in our case) play some games, 
Stay up till the break of day, 
Maybe get into a fight. 
Even though we're hittin' 20 (different ages in our case)
And we haven't yet matured, (and yes, we actually have.)

so there is this girl that i am interested in. shes beautiful, nice, sincere, and just a good person in general.  we arent supposed to be together; yet we try anyways. holding on to the small possibility that maybe one day we can be something. for some reason i believe its attainable. im hopeless in that way. maybe waiting that long will make everything all the more meaningful. i am just willing to take a gamble... after all love is a gamble in the end i think. anyways... im too tired to post a full thing but i figured id put something down to start off."

"event","Alright so here it is... I&nbsp;am in a giant ditch.
I have been trying to get a job, but remain with this shitty Chili's one.
I don't have any money to spend for fun at all.
I barely have gas to get to work these days.
I have stopped my bad habits, and substituted them with good ones.
Today is the first day to my new life.
I intend to reach for the goals of my past.
I am tired of just settling with what I have right now.
I will admit that I have been afraid.
&quot;Afraid of what,&quot; some may ask.
I've been afraid of disappointment.
Failing at my dreams, and not accomplishing what I've wanted.
At the rate I've been going... I will never see a part of what I want.
This is day is when it all changes.
I don't break my promises.
I promised myself not to look back, and to do what I must.
I will strive to obtain my goals.
If I cannot accomplish them, I will be happy to have at least tried.
Failure isn't a bad thing I've realized.
If you try your hardest to get back up, then you are at least better than those who don't try.
People say that I am crazy for how I've been acting lately.
I am not crazy... I am determined.
I have given up friendships and romances because I've started to ask things.
I want a clear life.
I don't want to be who others like.
I want to be a person I will accept when I&nbsp;am old.
With this frame of mind, I am happy to say fuck you to those who don't understand.
I've said similar things before, but the difference this time is clear.
It's my turn to be selfish."

It seems that it keeps me blind
I can no longer see where to go
Nor can I feel my heart flow
The bonds have begun to fade
People begin to believe I have it made
They cannot see this building sorrow
It drowns me and makes me wonder bout the morrow
I wonder if it will be a better day
As of late I have nothing more to say
The friends I have become memories of old
Now they are nothing more than stories told
It seems apathy is what I use to continue on
My heart feels like its in a nonstop marathon
I am bound to crash from this ache
The pain is too tough to take
I hope to find new life
One far from this strife
I'll forget the consequences once I run
When I am gone, I wonder who I will stun"

When I look back at all my friends, I realize that it is no surprise. I feel as though my faith in people has died. It's reached the point to where I don't really enjoy being in social situations.

Work:
Chili's and Douglas Aquatics

Life Situation:
Struggling, happy, inspired, and confused

Love Life:
Difficult to explain and part of my confusion.
The Artist: she makes me happy, inspires, amuses, understands, comforts, but in the end currently unattainable.
The New: she is still trying to figure herself out, and doesn't know what she wants. She always eats, is passive, and she's funny.

Hopes:
To get back in college this fall, and find a decent job. The restaurant industry can suck a nut. 
To find a relationship that will last, and that I feel comfortable in. No one likes to feel like they need to change.

Today:
I work all day life guarding near Northlake Mall.
Going home to hangout after.

Food:
Subway for lunch.
Don't know what to do for dinner."

Now I&nbsp;look at the posts that continuously come, to see that we are all different. Whether it is for better or for worse, we have all changed. I understand that change is inevitable, but I didn't think that I would stray from everyone so quickly. I don't regret turning my back to just about everyone. I regret not showing everyone who I am. Those who see me now will get that chance. I don't have time or energy to wear a mask. Before I put up a wall, but now it's gone. This is probably my last entry in here, but I&nbsp;just wanted to say one thing.

Even when things break down, get tougher, or seem impossible to overcome, just remember with determination anything is possible. Running won't get you anywhere. Live as you want to with no looking back. It's okay to reminisce, but don't get lost in a memory.

I used to look up at the stars all the time. I&nbsp;would blank out looking at them. I realize I was just dreaming about what I&nbsp;could do with my life. Dream about falling in love, scoring a great job, and living the dream life.

Now I look straight ahead. I no longer want to aim up. I want to aim forward. Dreams are useless. I will turn them into a reality. I know what I want. From now on I am living for me. I hope that we all reach our goals.

I will be moving again soon sadly... economy has screwed a lot of things up. My family and I will be moving into an apartment... yay. &lt;-unenthusiastic yay haha. I was planning on moving out with a friend, but decided that I'd rather get back in school first. I would much rather be educated than independent. I&nbsp;have the rest of my life to be on my own.

I realized I don't really have many friends. I mean... a lot of people consider me a friend, but in all honesty we aren't. I can think of 3 people that are really actually my friends. I am just tired of the way people are honestly... which is why I&nbsp;haven't really ever opened up to anyone. I am waiting till I find the girl that accepts who she sees, which is a guy full of flaws. I&nbsp;act one way, but its so easy for me to act better. I would just rather find someone who can accept the unpolished version of myself. I am actually an intellectual and humble; yet I act as if I am self-absorbed with no common sense.

I hate rainy days... for some reason I&nbsp;always have random tears fall down throughout the day. I don't even cry... it's just one tear that will fall. Sometimes I wonder if it is because of a forgotten memory, but I can never figure it out.

Thought basket - location for my mind to release. I have so many ideals, beliefs, feelings, and concepts that I consistently forget, but I am hoping to start recording them.

Mind as of now:
Who am I?...
I&nbsp;was walking to the promenade, and I decided to retrace my life up to now. Starting from birth to present day, I will be writing down anything that comes to mind, which includes my dirtiest of secrets. I&nbsp;feel doing this will allow me to understand myself on a whole new level. I know a good amount about myself. I know a good amount of my flaws, and I also know a decent amount of my strengths. Even though I know myself to a decent extent, I cannot truly say who I&nbsp;am. I have a name that I go by everyday, but it most definitely does not describe the person I am or will become. It is a label that separates me from the billions of others in the world. I am Cuban, but that only says where my family comes from. It is only the culture I was born into. We are all individuals in control of our own destinies. Each choice we make leads us down a dark road with constant splits. We take the streets we want. I&nbsp;want to find out why I chose each of the streets I walked. By doing this, I&nbsp;am hoping to figure out where I want to go.&nbsp; I'll leave it at this today... but there is most definitely going to be more."

Whether it takes a short time&nbsp;or my entire life, I will&nbsp;be the person I've yearned to become. I never&nbsp;imagined that I would&nbsp;be fit physically. I mean I know I wasn't fat, but at one point I was chunky.&nbsp;Now I&nbsp;can actually run without coughing up a lung.&nbsp;I am fully aware that I have a few bad habits, but&nbsp;I won't lose those habits until I want to rid myself of them.&nbsp;

Goals:
Become a better&nbsp;artist
Learn to play the guitar
Continue the book I was writing or start a new one
Get back in college&nbsp;in a&nbsp;year or two
Work as hard as possible at my new job (Cheesecake Factory (I&nbsp;am a cook))
Surround myself with goal oriented people
Stop allowing others to&nbsp;use me
Workout and become healthier
Stay true to the reality that is me

Who am I:
An artist (writer, sketcher, and hopefully a musician in time.)&nbsp;
A hopeless romantic
A nerd (I enjoy the occastional anime and sometimes cry when I see drama or romance movies)
A realist with optimistic thoughts (I understand the reality of the situations put in front of me, but I hope for the best.)
An intellectual being
A musical person (I enjoy all music and the beauty it holds)

I am one of a kind, but similar to others.
I once wished to become perfect, but I realized something randomly.&nbsp; Perfection in itself is a paradox because a flaw is needed. It is just like the idea of normality. People have different ways in seeing things, and that is the truth behind the human mind. We all have different thoughts about certain things; yet we still judge others who live according to different views.

I will do my best not to judge. I hope I will be able to help others find themselves, and that I can move forward along with people who have come to similar realizations."

"event","Tomorrow I leave to Florida for two weeks. I have been looking forward to this for a while. Finally I have a chance to escape for a little while. I hope that when I return that things will change. Maybe things will become better when I get back. I just have to work hard, and really just live my life.

My grandmother asked me what I feared today when we were eating dinner. My sister and my little cousin were at the table too. I couldn't tell her. I fear leaving a familiar place. The reason I can't move on is because I have gotten so comfortable with my life at home. When she asked that question, I knew that I had to move on. I just keep making excuses for myself, but I am tired of lying to myself. Surprisingly it turns out that maybe I am growing up. Life continues to amaze me. =] it turns out I get to live my biggest dream.

Biggest Dream: Live my life as an adventure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -It's pretty much there haha

Oh and I have not been attracted to anyone for a bit of time now. Yay haha I just want to find some good friends. I don't want anyone that I can't count on. It sucks investing time in people that will just get in your way. I like people that can actually hold a conversation, go on adventures, aspire to make something of themselves, and aren't just bums. Basically I want to meet more musicians and artists... because lets face it, they are the coolest people around."

"event","I have disappeared from livejournal for quite sometime. I just didn't feel like typing or reflecting on my passing days, but it is time to talk about the time that's passed. Life as of now is rather chaotic. Just recently I lost many of my supposed friends because of a lie. Well let me rephrase that statement. Most of the people, which I had considered to be my friends, turned their backs to me because of a rumor.

The rumor: 

That I had molested a girl at a party.

The truth behind the rumor: 

Not too long ago I went to a girl's birthday party. Before I got there I had taken one hit of acid. It was actually pretty good. When I got there i took another hit, and packed a bowl. It seemed to be a glorious idea. Since I wasn't going to be drinking, I felt smoking would be a great alternative. I wasn't wrong either. I was having the best trip ever. I also had a task that night. Photography was on me. Oh! I also had to make sure to record some of the music that was being played. Finally toward the end of the night, I finally felt tired. I went up to this girl, and asked her if I could sleep next to her. The couch was taken and the only other place was next to her. I've known her for a good amount of time. There was no harm to be had in cuddling with her. When we woke up, my hand had slid a little down her pants. I admit that it is unusual that my hand had been down there, but nothing had happened. We were just sleeping, and I move in my sleep, which is a known fact. When I realized this, I apologized to her. She knew that I meant no harm. We continued talking, and things seemed to be fine. My mistake was believing things were fine. She told two people exactly what happened, which is fine. The reality is that in a small way I disrespected her, and I was fine with having to make amends in some way. I even told her that I would try to make amends how ever possible. Well she started telling a different story to people. Saying that more happened than what actually occurred. It is because of the exaggeration that a supposed friend tried to fight me. While sitting and talking to a friend, he walked up and began to punch at me. I blocked the hits and ended up with no bruises. I don't wish to fight anyone. I especially don't want to fight people that I once called friends. Now I walk around having to keep an eye behind me because there are more that wish to follow in his actions. Since people wish to follow a lie, I now walk in paranoia.

The result: 

I now know who I can truly call friend. In a small way, I am thankful for the false accusations. I no longer waste my time with people that hangout with me just to kill time. I have gotten more into self realization. I am no longer the one that people count on. I used to be the guy to go to at a time of need. Those who I sacrificed myself for, turn their backs now that I need help. I will become a better person now. Since more time is open, I will start working out more. I will also get back into writing. I won't waste my life away any longer for people that will just leave me when they are needed.

Current life updates:

I still stand by the idea that my mom and step dad will divorce.
I was working at Good Ol' Days as a cook. They screwed me over so I quit.
I got a job at Cheesecake Factory. I will be a cook there starting in July.
I am going down to Florida soon and staying there for a few weeks.
I cut my hair and it doesn't look bad.
I started driving an expedition, but I don't anymore. A drunk driver forced me to drive into a street sign. I messed up the truck and have to pay for damages. I won't get it back even after paying for the damages.
Life is turning around. I believe it will become better. Everything has a balance. For every bad time, will be followed by a good one."

It was weird though.. because there was so much I wanted to say.
I kind of pushed everything I wanted to say to the side and acted perky.
I mean sure I am always perky but I sort of just wanted to relax and talk.
Sigh... haha I have changed... looking at me now and in the past.
I didn't care about boundaries or what people thought.
I wish I was still like that.
Maybe then I would have been able to smile at the end.
Gah... she is still gorgeous and makes me smile though.
Hahaha the girl I was hopelessly in love with.
I am a crazy kid what can I say.
But the craziest part of me is that I still kind of feel like I did back then.
I haven't had that feeling until I was with her.
Sort of like I can go back to being myself."

But then it took a turn for the worst.
In the morning I got into an argument with the parentals...
Then I get lectured at work and the put me to the places I hate most
Finally after long hours of torture I get off
Change and get into comfortable clothes then head to coffee works
Cuz thats where I used to go when things went bad
Then I go to roll a blunt for someone and it breaks all the way down
I return to the works and just find out something I didnt want to know
Leave and end up chillin with my step bro
Fortunately my day turned around once the drinks hit...
But then I get to the place I am staying
The room smelled like shit...
Gah so I ended up passed out on a bed in a room that smelled like nastiness
Fortunately the drinks made the whole predicament bearable

Sigh I need to just look forwards and stop going after things that are no longer there.
I think I will just go eat sushi by myself... at least that way I have it!

"event","I finally realize that I am changing. Even though I know we all change, I just realized how I have been changing. It is a good thing really. I have ambitions and goals. I am realizing my boundaries, and also what needs to be done. Unfortunately I know that it means cutting tires with certain people. If I am to better myself, I need to stop doing what I have been, which is avoiding reality. I will try not to intoxicate myself or put myself in a position where it'll be around me. I understand that someone may read this, but my main purpose to put this here is as a reminder to myself rather than to inform. I am me, but sometimes it's better to become a more mature me. Haha I am getting old. I know that I am still young... but how much longer can I say that. Making excuses on why I can't do certain things has always been my way, but it seems those excuses aren't working anymore. I guess it's time for me to start moving forwards again. Time doesn't stop, only mentality does. Even writing this shows me how much of an idiot I have been. No wonder I can't get a girlfriend lol. There was only a little sadness in that comment.

You know something weird though. The thought of being older and having a kid or two keeps coming to mind. Wouldn't that be great... to have a kid. Not because its normal, but because you know that you'll love them. I know I will... I lost my fear because of realizing that. I know I will be a good dad because of my mistakes. With each mistake comes a lesson that you can one day tell your kid. I want a family... in time at least I want one. I am still not mature enough though, I mean no one is ever mature enough to have a kid. I know that with time though I can be more prepared. The future is what I am living for now... no longer for leisures.

Oh and I cut my hair... it's pretty short."

"event","Lets see... okay okay this will be quite an interesting update.

Well new things in my life lets just list them:
I quit smoking the cigs
My mom found some herb in my room
I went to my first club on Wednesday
I finally met a girl I've talked to on myspace for 3 years
I have one crush
I love dancing so much more
NoDa is awesome
I want to learn percussion
I am reading a book called: The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time

Alright so just a few days ago I gave my last cigarettes away with its case. I no longer have urges for them YAY! It was an expensive habit.&nbsp; I got sick trying to quit before... and then started back up. Now I just have no urges to smoke them though.

So the other day I went out with a few friends because they wanted to go to a club. So we went to the Arboretum to meet up with someone, and then headed back to my place to smoke a bowl. I look at my window and my light is on. I saw my mom going through my things. She found some weed I left in my pocket of my shorts. I hid those shorts under my bed so that meant she was digging around pretty well.

We went to The Forum because I didn't feel like dealing with it. My mom called me but I didn't answer. I text her instead and said I know she found it and basically I expected that she would one day search my room. Anyways she flushed it away... *tear tear*

So yeah we get to The Forum and it's my friends Matt, Ashley, and Amy. We get the end of the line that would take at least one in a half to two hours to get through. It pretty much blew at first sight. Not too long after standing there a guy walks up and says, ""Don't ask questions but if I point at you follow."" He points at 3 people and then at me and Matt. I was like hold up... these are our dates (referring to Amy and Ashley) so he said they could come too. So we follow and skip the whole line. It was fantastic! I danced all night. I was in my own little world called The Arty Dancing Zone. Definitely a good experience.

My mom and I had coffee a day later and talked it all out. She doesn't agree with me smoking but wont tell me to stop. So yeah now my momma knows about me and my shmokin haha.

So yeah I have a new crush and sigh... idk what to do... I get really nervous around this girl... she's my age and just awesome.

I went to Coffee Works two nights ago and I saw someone that looked familiar. It was this girl from myspace. Before I moved to North Carolina I decided to see the type of people around the area. So I added this one girl I thought was cool. We've talked a lot on and off to this day. We have made plans to meet up but it never happened; yet there she was in Coffee Works. She was so cute... not even gonna lie about it. Such a funny girl indeed. It was fun we talked for a good while.

Last night I ent to NoDa for the first time. The music was pretty chill. It is a good area but it could of been better. I can't wait to go on Friday. I want to dance in the Drum Circle lol. 

I leave for Florida Saturday night for a week...

If I were the sun, she would be my moon. Forever opposite of me but catches the light I shine better than most. One day we will eclipse and be together for an eternity on end.

Love all my friends and what not."

I was definitely wrong...
I havent been able to eat because I feel so sick
Oh well it is for the best anyways...
I get off of work soon yay...


EDIT:

I couldn't get through two days of not smoking... I smoked two cigarettes today
I went to the Arboretum after work and just chilled
I used the time that I didn't see people to think
I realized that the girl I like doesn't need me putting any problems in her life
So I have decided to do my usual thing
Force myself not to like her more than a friend
It will be a good thing in the end probably
Maybe not for me but it's what ever
Anywho I met some random people today
Some were cool and others were sketch
But It wasn't too bad of a day... just not constructive
I want some sushi really bad... but only good sushi
When I am desperate like I am now... Harris Teeter isn't satisfying enough"

"event","Yeah yesterday after work I just went to Coffee Works
I just wanted to take my mind off things
Then I went to Ka Von's and chilled for a while
Came home and fell asleep
Then today I went to Coffee Works again
Ran into Jake and Nathan
Becca came soon after
It was a whatever day
The rain made it feel a little better
I realized that I shouldn't try anything anymore
I am quitting cigarettes and I already feel sick but I am going to go through with it
Sigh... I think I am going to take a hiatus from the arboretum
Just certain things I want to avoid really
Jake was a little disappointed because I was trying to hangout with Becca and Christy
Only because I wasn't trying to hangout with him
I am not going to try and hangout with really anyone for a good bit
It helps avoid depression which I don't need
I tend to smoke more when that happens
Not cigarettes either...
Which is what I did all of yesterday to clear my mind
Kind of backfired but it's what ever

Sometimes in our lives
We face some awful lies
Yet we cannot deny
That sometimes we have to cry
I shed a tear
A thousand times a year
It is not something I fear
It helps my mind become clear

There were no words really exchanged on the ride
Because I really just don't know what to say
Really though what can I say... when my thoughts don't make any sense
I am just so very confused
If only I knew what to do...

They say I am sweet like sugar
 Sadly enough not many people like it now a days
 They say I am the good type
 But so many are looking for the bad
 They say I am an awesome person
 Yet people like to go for boring
 They say that I am unique
 Still the common ones get it all
 What is the point in being me
 When all I am is never good enough
 I am the optimistic one
 Yet these pessimistic thoughts are drowning me
 I am the nice guy
 Still so many bad things are said
 I am human like the rest of the people
 Yet I am not allowed to make mistakes
 I am just a hopeless boy
 Nothing seems to go my way
 I am a lover
 Yet so many people want to fight
 I am so much more than a book cover
 Yet people just read the title
 In the end all I can say is that this is me
 And I am trying every day to be better"

I just don't get why I was sad today... I shouldn't of been.
I got to see her... that should be enough.
=/ sigh...

Work went well for the most part.
I got off early and went straight to Coffee Works.
It was mostly just to see one person.
Not going to lie... she looked absolutely stunning.
Now I am home and probably going to listen to some music.
I shall try and remain optimistic and happy... because I don't have a good reason to be sad."

Yeah she is pretty much awesomeness in a bag. We have chosen our own dog in Pet Land. I just met her not too long ago , but she is an awesome friend. We have our own secret society... with many projects in hand. I have been talking to this girl lately, and yeah wow just thinking about her just got me lightheaded. I am friends with her ex, but I met them both at the time. I mean I am not going to stop liking this girl because of someone else. Plus I mean you can't help how you feel, and I don't want to lose this feeling either. It is nice to feel like this. 

Anyways yeah today is July 4th. I have cleaned my room, and hangout with Christy. We say Wicker Park, Elizabethtown, Part of Dazed and Confused, and part of the Notebook.&nbsp; My dvd messed up while watching them. We had Pizza Hut and just chilled. It was a fun day. Although it was planned more for seeing another person but yea. It still worked out to be awesome, and Christy I will win this Tickle War of ours. (just to let you know)
Yeah life is as good as you make it.

Don't drink and drive... drink and then drive.

Live like there is no heaven, and that way you will have created your own.

Tears can fall for joy instead of sadness."

"event","There's only one way to describe my life as of now... Free
I am free from my problems of the past.
Drama died along with my high school years.
I won't say I don't have drama or stress, but it's different from before.
This time it is for actual problems.
It isn't because of a girl or what someone said.
It is about worrying how I will pay things, or about how I will get to where I need to be.
I also don't need to worry about girls.
I mean I have always talked about wanting to find the right one.
It never happened of course because I don't think there is such a thing, but I have met a lot of interesting people along the way.
I have a whole new set of friends that I adore.
Examples:
Christy is this awesome girl who just all around lovable and an amazing person when you get to know her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She reminds me of this girl I used to be with. Funny enough is that they are both Filipino...
Becca is this girl that has me turning in circles because I am constantly in awe when I talk to her. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's got me hooked but in the best way imaginable.
Alex is this little Spanish dude who is funny as hell... beat me at chess today... very sad.
Tim is this kid that works at Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream... he is one of the nicest people I've met.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He honestly deserves an amazing girl.
There are so many people I could list... but I think I mentioned the most important ones.

Movies that have changed my life recently:
Wicker Park
Garden State
Bridge to Terabithia
Pan's Labyrinth 

Must Sees Though are:
Transformers and Knocked Up (both were freaking awesome)

Life is about living... so stop worrying and just make looking back worth it.

Just smile because it helps the sunshine..."

It has worked very well to be honest, but it just isn't me. Now I don't even know how to go back. I don't really have any friends either. I mean sure I talk to a lot of people. In all honesty though, I ask myself this one thing. Will I even talk to most of these people in a year or will they want to talk to me? The simple and realistic answer is no. Sigh... I just want something real. I want a girl to walk into my life and take control of it in an instant. I am admitting it, I want to be in a relationship that will change me. For the better of course.

LOST IS AMAZING!
That is my end note.
Life Rules!"

Yup I was used yet again.
*sigh* girls suck... no offense but yup.


EDIT:
I feel better now that I had a chocolate shake... they make the world go round.
I dont think girls suck anymore either.
Just a select few."

"event","Have you ever felt like your life is rising
But at the same time it is falling
It sucks but at the same time it doesnt
I am very much confused not going to lie
Why I am even putting this here I dont know
I just wish that things for once would just be great
Haha but I know that lifes too much a bitch to do that
With the good comes the bad
How true it is...."

"event","Haha funny how things change.
People change
Feelings change
The world changes
I am pretty much happy
And I realize I have changed a good bit
I talk to a lot more people
I have a gotten taller haha
(Which I am constantly told)
I listen to all music
I dance randomly
Sometimes I dance weird
(Which is fun... why be serious)
I have no hate despite what is said
I have dropped all grudges
I dont want to have drama
I am 18
I have a decent life
Some good friends
Maybe 1 person I actually trust
I am satisfied with my life
It could be better
But it could be worse
So why is it that people judge
Why is it that everyone is constantly saying things about each other
I realized that yeah I too had gossiped a little
But I didnt bend the truth
That is still no excuse
I want everyone to just stop with this nonsense
This gossip and hate... its pointless
Things end so randomly... even lives
So why will you possible end your life with a grudge... or a hate
Or even a what if
My two friends who were once best friends... stop your nagging and get over it
You dont need to be amazingly best friends... but stop not liking each other
Well thats all I have to say"

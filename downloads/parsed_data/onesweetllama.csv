Thinking of quitting andrews and working at the ymca as fitness staff.  Pro's/Cons...

Pros: get away from boss-from-hell, who gives me at least one irrational and wrongly-assumed exploding scolding each shift.  get away from butloads of bullshit.  increased pay.  no driving whatsoever.  ymca = 2 blocks from my house.  no disgusting greasy food feeling.  no disgusting food.  no excuse not to work out.  better schedule.  no ""on call"" obligations (honestly... what is Andrew thinking... the only other prfession who requires on call is that of a doctor.  it's making me sacrifice 2 nights of my week- mustr be totally free for their convienence with no compensation to me whatsoever)

cons: leaving one or two really cool people.  free salad bar.  (um, my home-made salads are way better)  Not getting to dress up to work at 228.  and, er, applying and hoping i'm accepted...

I know the grass is always greener, blablabla.  but i don't care.

This weekend was the suckiest thing that has happened since er... well, I'll leave THAT part to myself... But seriously, I wasn't me.  At all.  It might have been because I couldn't find my medication, thus didn't take it, which my doctor said would be hell to stop cold turkey for even a day- and I witnessed two; or for other reasons which, er, I'll also keep to myself, (jeez, this is a crappy post); and I'm sure part of it was spiritual warfare, but this morning I am feeling much more at peace.  

I just read a blurb by Michelle about how she has changed in the past year.  Hmm, in the past two years I see so many shades of me that I don't know which one is true.  Nor which one I like the best.  Ack, this ramble is starting to sound like that fruity simpson song.  Oh I gotta get outta here before I REALLY shame myself.

Your birth on the 16th day of the month gives a sense of loneliness and generally the desire to work alone. 

You are relatively inflexible, and insist on your being independent. 

You need a good deal of time to rest and to meditate. 



You are introspective and a little stubborn. 

Because of this, it may not be easy for you to maintain permanent relationships, but you probably will as you are very much into home and family. 

This birth day inclines to interests in the technical, the scientific, and to the religious or the unknown realm of spiritual explorations. 



The date gives you a tendency to seek unusual approaches and makes your style seem a little different and unique to those around you. 

Your intuition is aided by the day of your birth, but most of your actions are bedded in logic, responsibility, and the rational approach. 

You may be emotional, but have a hard time expressing these emotions. 

Because of this, there may be some difficulty in giving or receiving affection.</td>

I spent the weekend with my grandparents in St. Petersburg.  :)  They're the cute kind that you would want to wrap up in blankets and feed them cookies.  Grandma and I spent an afternoon exploring an Impressionist exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts.  It featured ""Monet's London,"" a collection inspired by Monet's <I> Houses of Parliament, Effect of Fog <I> consisting of over 140 reflections of the Tames by various Impressionists.  My favorite were actually two little etchings on paper by Felix Buhot.  Check him out, he's pretty clever.

We visited the Extreme Home Makeover house in St. Petersburg (the guy was shot and blinded in a gas station stick up and now goes to grandma's church); saw Terri Schaivo's clinic, outside of which, stood many protesters; and drove by the memorial service for Jessica, the girl they had found murdered a few days ago.  So I have had a well-rounded hands on lesson in historical/current events this weekend. 

And gooo... If anyone ever needs to stay in Perry, FL for some strange reason, go to the Best Western.  It's ranked #1 in the world, and I believe it.  We stopped by to take refuge from the storm on the way home and upon entering, were warmly greeted by two hosts and offered wine (Merlot, Chardonnay or a cocktail?) and were then ushered into a dining room furnished with white and dark chocolate covered strawberries, cookies, fruit, coffees and teas.  We weren't even staying there... just running from the storm.  Anyway, go there.  It's only $70 a night.

I get my wisdom teeth out wednesday!  If anyone wants to see Leah's face all fat (a once in a lifetime event!) or see her on some serious drugs, don't come by my house because you will be rejected.  I am going into hiding.  Unless you bring coffee from afar."

Late-night social outing that was much overdue for me, as i've been a homebody for a few months.  Saw a few people that i haven't seen in a while- Eric, Ryan, Austin, and Cody.  I hadn't seen Cody for over a year.  FC put on an amazing show.  One of their best, most certainly.  

Ben, Ryan, Jeff, Ward and I went to see The Ring II last night.  Now that I look back on it, it is hilariously funny, but it wasn't last night.  I screamed, jumped, and slapped myself in the face in attempts to cover my eyes more than Ben did, and sure, I was more scared than he was, but I also watched about twice as much as he did.  He hid behind my coat half the time.  Later I pulled all of my hair down in front of my face to mimic the girl and scared Jeff and Ben.  

Easter is approaching.  I am ashamed of my recent lack of devotion and admiration.  I desperately need to spend some time with my Creator.  I'm craving Him, but that devil sure is good at preventing me from fulfilling that craving.  Oooooo he makes me so angry.

Emma is home with me now, but I don't own her- legally she still belongs to the shelter, as do her kids.  Sigh.  I know I will want to adopt one of the kids, but the rest of the kittens and Emma will need homes... and they are not mine to give away.  The animal shelter  owns them and will have to take them back.  

To me that's sick.  I wish I could find homes for them myself.  Sooo anyone who wants a kitten, consider adopting one from the shelter.  The price is $50, and they will fund 75% of the vet bill for getting him/her neutered/spayed.  

They have three ferrets up for adoption too!  :)

"event","More like back from captivity.  But yes, it could have escalated to the title.  For those of you who do not know, I was sent to Remuda,an in-patient treatment center in Arizona for anorexics and bulimics.  Two months living with 30 girls from across the nation who suffer from the same disease- just imagine.  At home i felt alone.  Friends and family could sympathize, but never fully understand.  However, I was amazed to find that anorexics across the map all have the same, bizarre, thwarted mindset.  We had a culture of our own.  

Anorexia is one of the most misunderstood diseases.  That's what it is: a mental disease.  So many factors can contribute to its development; family dynamics, trauma, verbal abuse...  Mine were acceptance and control.  But I won't get into that.  By the time I would have fully explained it you would be snoring.  But I will say that it's a horrid disease- one that imperialises and distorts the mind.  A few have accused me of corrupted vanity, quite possibly thinking that the illness was a cry for attention or even a simple, egotistical, shallow phase.  I suppose that yes, most eating disorders are cries for attention, but I would certainly not attribute them to the desire for popularity, vanity, or really nothing of the sort.  It simply signifies emotional needs left unfulfilled.  Maybe the victim has an emotionally absent father, or is surrounded by external pressures to perform perfectly in every way possible.  Often times a very low self esteem plays a role.  I used Ed (I characterize the Eating Disorder as a person.  you can see I've been in therapy too long!) to fill the lonely void, to gain a sense of control, and to claim an identity.  It seemed as though everyone else had something they were known for- the actress, the musician, the genius, the anorexic.  After a while I knew I had to live up to the title.  Ah I could go on but I think you get the general picture.  All I am trying to say is that it is a very real disease, and it's addicting.  It progressively requires more and more starvation to produce the same effects, the same satisfaction.  Biologically, the brain can not perceive an image by its true proportions... but only when that image is the one looking back at you in the mirror.  The thing looking back at me was rather large.  It was not until weeks into my recovery that I saw a photo and realized the toll it had taken.  In the photo I looked dead. 

On the brighter side Remuda was the best thing that has ever happened to me.  I now feel more alive and joyful than I have in years.  I am more myself than I have been in months!  With that said, I need to apologize to the friends that I was a sucky friend to.  You know who you are.  But hey, I am back, spitfire and all.  I give all glory to God."

One week and I fly to Virginia!  UVA land, here I come.

Ow my heart hurts!"

"event","Re-entering common life brings its rewards and its grievances.  Those would be freedom and makeup work, respectively.  I think all would agree that when something is forced on someone by a group of other someones, that particular someone wants nothing other than to resist.  It's imperialism, baby!  (To quote Horaldo Fontaine)

I've been reading old aim conversations that I had saved as word documents.  You may call me loser. But they brought on the nostalgic feelings.  

Speaking of cute photographers, Capitol Speedway's last show is friday night at 9 at Big Daddy's.  Not that any of the band members are photographers, no no.  But I'll be there."

"event","The wall is high, the black barn,
The babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes
And I know soon that the sky will split
And the planets will shift,
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop.
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.
Little sister, the fates are calling on you. 
Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind,
The sea rushes up my knees like flame
And I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc
And the cause is you lookin' up at me.
Oh baby, I remember when you were born,
It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly
And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas
And I lit a match and the void went flash
And the sky split and the planets hit,
Balls of jade dropped and existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop.
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.
Little sister, the fates are calling on you. 

I was goin' crazy, so crazy I knew I could break through with you,
So with one hand I rocked you and with one heart I reached for you.
Ah, I knew your youth was for the takin', fire on a mental plane,
So I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces
Burst from the barn and flames in a violent violet sky,
And I fell on my knees and pressed you against me.
Your soul was like a network of spittle,
Like glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic,
And I prayed as the lightning attacked
That something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack,
Something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack. 

The palm trees fall into the sea,
It doesn't matter much to me
As long as you're safe, Kimberly.
And I can gaze deep
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Into your starry eyes, oh. 

Oh, in your starry eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, oh. 

Oh, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby"

"event","This morning while eating a mango in the kitchen i overheard two electricians saying that the fire alarms were not working and would not be fixed until the fire department came at 5:00.  *Insert devilish smile here*  I ran back to the room and pulled out my secret stash of incense.  Dragon's blood reminds me of the end of school and this summer...  My moment of bliss ended with a knock from the janitor who said that she saw smoke billowing out from underneath my door and smelled incense, to which i claimed innocence.  i put it out after that. 

i'm beginning to love salsa dancing!  class today was so much fun.  having sarah over in the dorm last weekend cheated me out of the whole atlantis deal, but this weekend i am definitely going to fulfill that void. 

Ha!  So i finally met the cute boy from the second floor!  it was beautiful: i ran into him while descending the stairs.  he was playing his Taylor.  Yes, a Taylor.  His name is Cory.  Cory and i talked a while and he suggested that we play guitars together this week- boo-yah!  But then again I ain't countin no unborn chickens.  

Funny how in reading books, one sometimes falls in love with the antagonist, though he is representative of the very thing the reader is trying to escape."

"event","I'm taking salsa dancing lessons.  Met Stephanie and Ruben at the welcoming party that er, didn't exist- to be held at a later date.  Stephanie, an fsu grad taught me all the basic steps instead.  so now I am going to Atlantis with her saturday night for lessons then for hours of application of newly formed skills to real life situations.  Thus I need to get a few flowy skirts (mind you- NOT flippy skirts) and comfortable heels.  She said that it's not sketchy- unlike chubby's.  Or better yet, reflections. 

Haven't decided what to do with my finally finalized freedom yet (alliteration like woah).  Geez, it took them forever to cancel school.

Katherine and I made the newspaper!  We were quoted in regards to the storm while sitting at lake ella crocheting.  And now I feel like a grandma."

"event","I made the last-minute decision to go to the beach with all the BCM kids.  Good call, Leah!  Though the main idea was to meet great people, I lost my voice.  Slowly but surely they all figured out that it had flown away, and that no, I am not shy.  Anywho, it was great fun, and I met several wonderful people despite my inability to converse effectively.  

Then last night was the FC/Cool Hand Luke show.  I saw so many old friends, which was reassuring, in a sense.  Plus there was an abundance of attractive boys, heehee.  Dan and I talked for a while, and he assured me that Cody was doing well and says hello... shoot, if he could come to Wildwoodstock, my semester would be made.  :) 

To conclude the high-quality weekend, Miss Haley Payne called me at 12:30 am.  It was good to hear from her.  Her descriptions make me want to visit Texas, but I am not sure how that will happen, exactly.  She did, however, give me the brilliant idea to play my guitar on Landis Green.  Instant boy-magnet.  One guy fell off his skateboard while watching her... if I could get that sort of result, I will be very pleased indeed!"

"event","so i finished my epistemology essay- for the second time after having it torn to shreds by tom.  it should score b-ish, which believe me, is an accomplishment.  all those ""olda boys"" in there are kind of intellectually intimidating.  they've all had a few years of experience in PHI, so they, unlike me, know the ropes.  anyway, now my brain is fried from reading and writing about all types of evidentialist and non-evidentialist theories of knowledge and justification, which yay for me, include all of the foundationalist , coherentist, and evidentialist arguements.  so yeah, i've been antisocial, inactive, and progressively more and more depressed for the past week.  now i get to read 6 essays for a quiz tomorrow... sorry i'm done- had to rant.  and now my brain is fried and i don't care that this is not ""clear, concise, and precise"" let alone grammatically correct.

i went to bcm lunch thing today, talked to emily about missions and boys, then re-met a boy named jayme (sp?) pronounced ""hi-me.""  i first met him way back at celebration when he wore full camo to church and carried a big guitar.  so anyway, he is friendly and energetic.  and slowly but surely i make the right sort of friends.  oh, also found out that lauren across the hall from me is a bcm-er.  and she is really cool, so i'll see if i can hang out with her more often.  

i found another who shares my intense love of cs lewis!  the two of us always refer to him in bible study and automatically know what the other is talking about, which is exciting.

salsa dancing information meeting is next wednesday... if any of you cool cats are interested, give me a holla.  it should be fun.  

the wednesday after that is wildwoodstock. be sure to go and support capitol speedway.  no more to say here, for my heart is breaking.  dang, i was so sure they would make it.  why do all my favorite music artists have to be either dead or broken up?!?"

"event","i have nothing of great significance to declare, thus who knows why i am writing.  perhaps it is to delay the completion of the reading assignment and essay, which i have been struggling to complete for two days now.  soooo much reading.  i feel like someone else i know... ""no, can't go out tonight,i have to WORK.""  i'm sure all the girls in my hall think i am a scrooge.  i did, however, watch fight club for the first time with 20 dorman kids squished into amelia's room.  josh went...manwhore i'm sure, so no cigar.  and i gave a huge bag of cookies to the girls down the hall who i don't know well.  they probably don't know what hit them.  well that's what mom gets when she knows i won't eat them but uses them as an excuse to bring the entire family to visit my place.  that's why iwanted to go to uva... or uf.  

my computer has been restored and returned to me, which means listening to all my old music once again.  this being the music a friend let me copy onto computer... the same one that will probably die soon.  god, it breaks my heart.  it started as a simple interest in lou reed and iggy pop.  but this is bringing back too many memories.  

i have fish school tonight.  hopefully that will elevate the mood.  must-finish-essay-by-4:00pm."

"event","i am not sure why i feel so depressed.  i suppose this hapens to several freshman in the first few weeks.  i am finding that i miss several people who i gave little thought to over the summer.  er, scratch that.  putting pictures on my wall doesn't help much.  just a reminder.  funny how the friends of the summer and the first week in the dorm before school seem to have dissapeared.  
i am trying to become more involved in the christian clubs here.  i think that is where i will find the most fulfillment.  
the girls on my floor in dorman are so much nicer than the ones in smith.  we all painted the hallway walls yesterday.  i did a jamacian scene.  
well, off to do the homework i didn't do this weekend.  yay for cultural imperialism.  i like locke so much more than giovanni pico della mirandola anyway.  he really IS an arrogant, well, imperialist anyway.
Kat and i split a tallcake two ways, and of course we couldn't finish it.  we didn't laugh as much thins time :(
i think i need a hug. 

oh, and mom and dad, i know you are reading this.  it's okay, i guess.  i don't mind.  just stop pretending that you find it on accident."

epistemology my favorite by far, john and i should have made the top crisp shirts, but together we would only fulfill the ""to.""
i will be the master at that class.  we already took the cousin of the class written by the same professor.  so exciting!

i'm moved into my dorm!!  it's gross- that is all i have to say about that.  i am currently in orientation, which has proved to be only mildly informative.  academic advisement was the only worthwhile portion.  however they wouldn't let me take more philosophy classes during the 1st semester.  the only ones for now are epistemology and reasoning and critical thinking.  then middle eastern history (history of asia was capped) and either physical anthropology and prehistory or planetary geology.  i'll have to wait until next semester for italian.  
and i do miss my friends a great deal."

"event","I was wondering if anyone was still reading Michael Phillips's (Zombiezen) live Journal? I hope so. Mike was very honest in what he wrote about. Through his words he lives on. It has been nearly 3 months since he passed on. The pain of missing him is still strong in my being and in the souls of those who truly loved him. He will be alive in my soul until we meet again. Please comment if you are still reading his words. Or you can e-mail me at tarotjim@gmail.com

I expect to see him on line every time I log on to my computer. I still have him on my buddy lists. Just can't bring myself to take him off. I still miss him so much. I guess I always will.
     His mom told me that his head stone is now on the grave with a Book, Music note and a Movie Camera engraved on it. Leesa, his sister said that there should be a computer on it also.

"event","Last saturday, 7/2/05, Tony (Bluedragon) and I, Jim (TarotJim) went to Turlock to visit Mike's grave. He is under a huge Redwood tree. If I could figure out how to do it I would post pictures of the site.

I left a Starbucks Carmel Frappacino and a dozen pink roses. Tony left Sunflowers (Mike's favorite flower). He also left a CD of Mike's favorite music.

We were there with Mike's Mom Penny, his sister Leesa, his little neice and nephew Amber and Anthony.

Tony and I stayed until 10PM talking with penny. we also watched Video of him that ranged from when he was 2 or 3 to his mid Teen years.

Tony and I have agreed to post to his journal to make sure it stays up

Mike and I have been best of friends for over 15 years, and there is still a Mike size hole in my being that I don't think will ever be filled

I really miss you buddy."

Im getting a case of boost which is a diet suppliment for the body in case you cant eat like me and im hoping that will help. 
I also have been told to take a new hiv combo which im nervous about but i gotta do something my tells are 168 and viral through the roof and then there is the fact i weigh only 99 pounds right now. Being this thin is tough and actually painfull so im tying to gain weight . This not being able to eat solid foods thing is not helping hehe. im thinking it will go awaay soon though maybe after my body adjusts who knows. I am feeling better oddly enough and things are moving mostly smoothly for me and my roomie amy and that feels good. Im also allowing myself to nap when i need to instead of forcing myself to stay awake so i can sleep longer at night which no matter how much i exhaust myself i cant seem to do anyways. so sleep when ya need to and try to eat when ya can. Hope everyone is well big hugs

Memories

last night i just started crying hystericaly which over the last couple months ive been prone to do but this time it was just huge and i finally had some breakthroughs about my past and mom and old angers and fears and it was really cleansing but i am always amazed at how we can keep ourselves in denial for so long and not even know. Me and my mom talked all night and all this stuff came out and it was really good. Sometimes it takes something huge for you to see the truth and for me i need something really big sometimes hehehe. Im like ok god im willing to learn under less scary circumstances but i guess we all the need dif size pushes to get there hehe. MY whole world needs to be turned upside down sometimes and it has oddly enough. I dont even like horror movies much anymore cuz i started to think hey ive got enough of this crap in my real life why am i inviting it as entertainment LOL. dont get me wrong i still have my favs and i still like a really good horror film (they almost dont make them anymore)but im not who i was before this all began. I was a much more fear based person when this all began and now im not and im able to move through things and im learning to let go of old angers and hurts i didnt even know i was hiding and running from so when they say everything happens for a reason maybe they are right."

HOpefully its just grown a tiny bit or even gone away YAYA but who knows and i wont know until we do some tests and find out more. That wont even begin to happen till april 4th. My spirits are up though and im hopefull there is some new treatments they have not tried yet cuz the last one was really bad for me.

I was so excited by the trailer for the last year and it looked so good but the film itself is tedious and kinda dull although gory. I traded that dvd and the osterman weekend dvd in today and got caveman and the man with two brains on dvd instead which i love.

Doctors make mistakes and i think they did. I have been making myself sick thinking i have this incurable terminal disease cuz they all told it was and thats just not true. I dont think i have what they say and i think i can beat whatever i do have. It really pisses me off they just give up under the guise of being realistic the way they do when they dont know shit.

"event","i seem to have disapearing cancer tumours or maybe they are not tumours as i first thought cuz they disapear then pop up then disapear again so go figure. Vicodin oh my lovely vicodin eases the pain yay! I have given in and finally started taking the pain killers cuz it just makes no sense to suffer like everyone keeps telling me. I have this aversion though to being doped up for some reason, like its giving up the fight or something but its not at all. It just makes fighting this thing easier. My momma left today and she was in tears which i hate cuz it makes me sad cuz shes sad and i dont want to feel sad. LOL. She is wonderfull though and i could not ask for a better mom for sure. She will be back this thursday so its not like im never seeing her again but i know its hard on her to leave and i like her here so i will miss her too.
Being sick really sucks i tell ya. It makes all of what was happy into a sad afair and dampens even the the happiest thoughts it seems. Im pretty good at being optimistic but you can see the fear and sadness on everyones face and its depressing. They don't like to see me in pain but i can't hide it cuz its just to much pain and it just sucks to have them soo sad. I need to get well soon cuz i don't think i can handle all these sad worried faces for very much longer. I've done sad and worried long enough in my life, I'm ready for some happy and excited instead for awhile :)"

"event","i hate waking up to a headache grrr but spose it could be worse hehe

Read a new article today of a study done on high risk groups for aids that was interesting. They tested t cell counts in hiv poz and hiv neg people in high risk and non high risk groups and found that even if the person was hiv negative they still had low tcell counts in the high risk group and even if the person was hiv poz they had high tcell counts if they were not in the high risk groups. There was a slight correlation between PHS levels in tcell aptosis in hiv poz people but it was very very small so i don't think it counts for much. 
High risk = gay men, iv drug users ect just to be clear.
low risk = hetersexual non drug users ect. 

anyways i got a link if anyone is interested"

"event","i have thought some more on the subject and i am not sure sex can even be controlled at all. maybe we are doomed to just fuck and suck our way into a bachnalian orgy of disease and destruction until our rotting orifice's ooze and rot into one another in a giant ceaspool of fleshy sickness and decay. 
Maybe the gods are pissed who knows.
I think there are two choices though logicaly and rationaly
One you can throw caution to the wind and tell yourself you will always be safe (which we know is pretty impossible given the flighty nature of all of us humans and our desires) and just fuck and suck all over the place hoping to fall into a love relationship one day or maybe never hoping to be in love but just have fun forever. That from a logical perspective will get you many stds and many health problems as well at the very least not to mention the emotional strain of it. 
two, you can abstain and wait and just jack off until the right person comes along for whatever amount of time and greatly reduce the chance of getting many diseases and emotional hang ups ect. 
Those seem to be the choices to me. The only problem i have is can we actually control the sex drive? Especialy in the younger generation. It seems to be biologicaly set to flower and scream from every pore at first. There must be a reason for this other than the desire to have babies. I mean there must be other biological imparitives at work here i think. 
I struggled and fought for years to maintain and believe in a free love and everything is alright attitude and lifestyle but the older i get the more i realize it was just naivet'e and not logic guiding me. In a disease free world it would be wonderfull to follow our sexual and romantic bliss anytime we like but we live in a world that has boundries set up against that. I mean biological boundries not moral or ethical ones. Some might say its all random but i don't buy into that theory at all. I think biology has purpose and its important to recognize it.  The drugs we take to maintain our ability to be so carefree about it all are killing us left and right so it just seems to me there must be a better way to do this whole thing ya know? 
anyways all for now."

"event","Well i just watched a stupid movie that defines the very words artsy fartsy i think. It was pretentious beyond beleif and is tapping subject matter much better explored in Louie males the lovers and even last tango in paris, in fact the latter is a masterpiece compared to this drivel. Whats the name of the film you ask? Anatomy of hell. I have rented a previous film by this director and i should have known better but it sounded interesting ( good reviews blah blah) So i plunked my three bucks down at the rental counter but what a letdown piece of crap. The main problem with the film is i dont have any clue who it was made for except as a protest against ideaology that was left behind hundreds of years ago. Contrite and silly to the extreme even though it does not think it is. Avoid this one if you can.

I've been thinking alot about sexuality and morality and just plain science and how those three fit together. 
I have come to this conclusion about sex and it is one that suprises me and is not based on any morality at all but just plain science.
Much as we would love to have free love and fuck whoever we want its a dangerous world out there filled with hundreds and yes there are actually hundreds of stds (aids, syph,the clap, a new one that make you bleed green puss out of your ass i read about just recently. Its in sf now 2 cases but its all over europe i guess.) Then there is children which raises the question of personal responsiblity and finally there are lots of just plain crazy fucked up people out there who will use you and treat you like shit.
When the pill came out it was seen as way to sexual freedom for women and men but i think in reality we need to look at human error and desire. You cant really treat sex like its a thing you can control and use. It is much to strong to be cornered and told what to do in a safe neat way so talking about the pill and safe sex is like saying well more than likely if i have some meat in my hand and walk into a cage with a hungry lion he will eat the meat and not my arm but sometimes he eats yer head. Sex is like that i think.
So heres what i think we should teach our kids.
Dont have sex unless you know the person for at least six months and dont have sex with anyone else but them until they die or you break up. ( ie divorce whatever) 
If your honry mastrabate and you will be fine or pursue other intrests cuz sex is not all thier is in life to be sure.
Now how to say that without sounding like a stupid christian uptight prude?
Cuz i think sex is great and wonderfull and not bad but unless we start putting some stops on it we are gonna be in a huge mess until our bodies develop anti bodies to all this disease out there. we could be extint by then.
I would in fact suggest not sleeping with someone until you have known them for two years at least but thats just me. 

anyways  im switching chemo drugs YAY! k hope everyone is well"

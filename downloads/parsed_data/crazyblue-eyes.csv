thats what the people used in the old days to&nbsp; grind up gold ore
it is basically a long log attatched to two bolders that a donkey pulls in a circle
..........
so anyways
then i went to see my grandpa
that was nice
he has the GREATEST stories
he was in the marines
he is a real live miner with a pick and ax
and he has been through the craziest situations!!

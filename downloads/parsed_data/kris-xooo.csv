Yesterday was fine<br>
Woke up early with Brittany and went out to breakfest with Derek<br>
Came back to my house made another music video this time with Derek haha<br>
Chris and Mikey came over and we went to Chris's house for like 2 seconds<br>
Walked around in the freezing cold almost like died of hypothermia<br>
Nick Sordillo called me and met me Brittany and Derek at Nana's pizza and brought us to townline<br>
Played games at Townline, tried to beat a gun game haha<br>
Saw Gina and she said she was sorry and over reacted<br>
I'm glad we're friends again : } <br>
Went back to Brittany's with Derek<br>
Made crazy videos<br>
Ate everything in sight<br>
Went to bed<br>

<br><br>
This morning at 7 was the scariest experience ever<br>
Brittany's mom ran upstairs and there was a loud beeping in the distance and was like ""GET UP THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE"" and Derek got up and bullted outside. Me and Brittany didn't understand what was going on cuz we were in ""LALA"" land when we woke up and we stood there aimlessly looking around. Then grabbed our phones and she grabbed her sidekick and ran outside. I guess the furnis blew up but the fire went out right after. Nothing was destroyed, they just needed to get the furnis fixed. It was the scariest experience and I'm so happy everything is okay and everyone.After a while we got to go back in the house and go back to sleep. We woke up at 12ish and went downstairs and like did nothing all day. I came home took a shower cuz I felt gross and now I'm here.
<br>
Right after I woke up this afternoon, Matty IMed me and told me he made a horrible mistake and that he's sorry and that he really cares about me : ] I'm so happy !!!"

"event","<center> Yesterday I woke up at like 1 and got rushed to get ready by Jeana and Jackie came here and Dan came and picked me and Jackie up and then we went and got Tess and went back to Jeana and Ryan's house. Ryan and Dan played the guitar and drums kinda for a while then we went downstairs and just hung out in Ryan's room. I had to leave at like 5 so I left. When my mom picked me up we went and got Brittany and her friend Jen and came back here. We waited for Kristina Caitlin and Shana to get here and went to Friendlys. We had too much fun in Friendlys. Then we left Friendlys and went to Townline. When we got there we couldn't bowl so we went and played in the arcade area and pool area. We met up with Brian Reggie Tim Nick and Matt. Brittany and Caitlin did Dance Dance revolution...haha they sucked : ] then we played pool and I saw John Mauro and Mike Tucka. I stayed with them most of the time cuz I haven't talked to John in a while and I just met Mike. John taught me how to play pool. Then I saw like half of Revere High come in and Steve came over to say hi. I saw Jose but he was being mean and didn't say hi. I saw Chris Flint too but he didn't say hi either. Then I saw one of my friends Sunshine and his friend Ed so I talked to them for a few minutes. At like 10 me Brittany Brian Matt and Nick went and played pool (Shana Caitlin Tim and Kristina came over to where we were after) Me Brittany and Brian were on a team. I totally sucked at bowling. I got a few good things though haha. Our names on the score thingy were so funny. Nick was Poo Matt was Ass I was Bum Brian was Snoodle and Brittany was Pelligun. Nick and Matt were on a team and they like totally blew us away. Nick taught me how to stretch before you bowl and do a little jump onto the floor before going. After strecthing I got better haha. I had a lot of fun last night. Shana's mom came and got me Brittany and Shana at 11. I got home at like 1115 and talked to Shane online for a while. Then he got off and I did some things on myspace and then went to lay down around 230ish. I called Shane before I went to bed and then went to sleep. Today I woke up at 1230 and tonight I'm going ice skating with Brittany haha we're gunna have so many pictures. We're going for my little sister's friend's birthdays. It's gunna be fun. I'll have a lot of pictures maybe I'll post some of them

"event","Hello well last night I went to the boys show in East Boston with Jackieface. Fellsway and Famous Last Words did good. I hung out with a lot of people last night for the first time. I was with Tess and Jeana some of the night too : ] I love them. I met the new member of Fellsway last night. His name is Dan, me and Jackie were with him and Ryan most of the night. Last night was fun but I kinda wasen't myself. I was very shy cuz I've never hung out with most of those people so I wasen't my loud self. It was so weird but now that I hung out with most of them I'll probably be my loud self around them whenever we hang out again. A lot of the people who knew me said I wasen't myself last night. So people know me as the loud Kristina not the shy Kristina lol. I came home and talked to Shane&hearts; for a while then I went to bed and today I woke up at 1230ish I think. I'm going to Plymouth Monday to visit Shane and Kylie want's to see me : ] Haha I absolutly love Kylie. Well I dnno what I'm doing today and I'm a mess right now so ya....I'll write later

"event","<center> Tuesday night Thomas called me from the Jingle ball and let me listen to some of Fall Out Boy haha then Haley called me after and told me all about it. She like hung out with Fall Out Boy ugh so jealous haha and The Pussycat Dolls !! haha I hate Haley : ]

<b>Wednesday</b>- I went to school. During 5th period Vanessa called me and told me she was having an axiety attack and when I got to my locker she told me she couldn't breathe and she blacked out and her throat hurt. I then explained to her that she was having an asthma attack. She's so stupid sometimes haha but I love her after school I had work with Haley. Work was okay. Haley had the littlest cup of coke and was off the walls! I wanted to punch her !! We had to make gingerbread houses and we got like ONE completed out of twelve and she was like going crazy and throwing the food at the kids that were helping us and got frosting all over her hands and whiped it on my arm. Haha then I went to dancing and ya as you can see in my last entry it sucked soooooooooo bad. I really don't want to talk about it. I left early cuz I had an essay to write that was due like a month ago and was 50% of my grade and I didn't do it until last night. Before I sat down to actually write the essay I went for a Staples run with Freddy then I came home and did the essay. I think I did a pretty good job. I talked to Shane for a little then talked to Matty for a little. Then I passed out cuz I was so tired.

<b>Today</b>- I was so lazy today and tired. I'm so sick too. I'm getting like wicked worn down from running around all the time. I went to school and it was okay. After school I came home for like an hour and then had to go to the church to do community service for CCD. The only kids who did it was me Brittany Chris and Mikey. It was nice to like see Chris and Mikey for once we haven't hung out in a while. I miss them! We finished sooner then expected and Chris's mom came and got us. Chris's mom let Chris drive home : ] As soon as me and Brittany got to my house my mom had to drive her to cheering. Now I'm sitting here waiting for dinner, I'm starving.

Tomorrow night is Nicholas Basil Silva's birthday party
Haha I can't wait !!! I'm either going with Britt or Freddy or both of them haha
I'll write tomorrow or whenever"

Today in school was good. I was wicked tired all day though. Ya I found out I went from an A to a D+ in English ugh I have to start doing my homework but on the good side I got an 100 on my Spanish quiz : ] and I have all my Spanish homework in for once. It always happens like that I go up in one subject and down in another. Whatever though. Difincences go in Wendesday so they should be out soon, hopefully I don't get one or I'll be punished again. Ya I've ben talking to Matt all day. We talk more now then we did when we went out. Today is Breana's birthday and in the halls the same girl hit us both by accident. She thinks it was on purpose haha. I have dancing soon. I really don't feel really good so it will probably suck. I'm talking to Thomas and he said he had an extra Jingle Ball ticket and Haley said there was none left and then today their cousin gave it to her friend. Ugh I could have met Fall Out Boy tonight if Haley knew there was an extra ticket..ya this kinda sucks, anyways I'll write later"

"event","<center><b>Wednesday-</b> I had school then work with Haley it was okay I guess we put frosting and jimmies into 240 little cups, oh how fun it was ! haha nope anyways then I went and got Brittany we got KFC then went to dancing until 9 instead of 930 cuz no one showed up for my 730-930 class. Our dance teacher went out for a little to get us drinks and Brittany hid under the box we dance on and was moving the box and it was the funniest thing ever. Sheila knew after a while it was Brittany. I have fun at dancing on most days : ]

<b>Thursday-</b> I had a half a day at school then I picked up Alexis and we went and got our nails done. Then we got Brittany and went tanning. Alexis and Brittany went home. When I got home Haley called and said I had to work. I got dropped off at the Rec Center and Haley, Thomas and Josh were there. We walked to City Hall and couldn't find our boss. We walked around City Hall and pretended we were in a 007 movie. It was pretty funny. Then we called Thomas's mom and we found out that we had to get things from the Rec Center and bring them to City Hall. We did that and then me and Haley went to Dunkins and White Hen. When we got back we had to set up everything for the Tree Lighting. It was okay. I had to pass out gingerbread cookies and sprinkles and frosting so the kids could make their own gingerbread men. My history teacher Mr.Bonanno showed up out of no where. Haha I love him. He told me I better study for my History test that is tomorrow or he would kill me. I didn't study, oops. After I got home, I talked to Shane and I was pretty upset cuz we got in a fight and then Freddy and Mike Silva called and they came by and they cheered me up : ] then I came in and that was it.

<b>Friday-</b> We were the only school around here that had school, it was gay but I got dismissed at 12ish. Then me my mom and Brittany got KFC and came back to my house then I went and got my hair done cuz the MC Winterball was suppose to be Friday night but it was so bad out with the snow and everything that it was cancelled. It was lightening and thundering out in the middle of a snow storm and it was ""white out conditions"". It was scary driving in it with my mom. We got home like an hour after we were suppose to be home. Traffic was terrible too. I called Freddy when I got home and he told me his car was stuck at school and he was stuck since 220 and it was like quarter of 4. That sucks, huh? Brittany came here and we sat in the whole night. Nikki and Nick came over and we watched Elf. Nikki and Nick left around 11 and me and Brittany stayed up until like 2. Brittany was upset cuz she got into a big fight with one of our really close friends so I made her something on my myspace that made her happy.

<b>Saturday-</b> Me and Brittany woke up around 11 and sat around. Then Brittany left at like 2 and had cheering. I went to Freddy's with Trav and Mark. We watched some Chuckie movie then some music videos. Then we decided to go the mall. Brittany called and we got her too. The mall was so boring. We left then dropped Brittany home then me. Then me and Brittany were starving so our friend Casey brought us to Panera. It was funny, Casey is one of the funniest people I have ever met. We got free food at Panera because Casey works there and our friend Pete was working too. After Panera we drove around a little then went back to Casey's and just hung out. Jorge came over too. Jorge and Casey said I look like a Nigga : [ then he was calling me and Brittany Niggahontis and Pocahontis then Casey and Jorge drove me and Brittany home around 11. I talked to Shane for a long time last night about a lot. I think I might be going to visit him next weekend or something I don't know yet. Then me and Brittany stayed up until like 2 again.

<b>Today-</b> Me and Brittany woke up around like 1 I think then we had to make chocolate chip pancakes cuz my parents went out and wouldn't get us anything so they abandoned me and Brittany. The pancakes were horrible. Then we watched the Big in 05 awards and Fall Out Boy performed they were really good. Then we watched random things and listened to music. Now we're watching ""She's too Young"" haha it's our favorite Lifetime Movie : ] It's about a girl who gets syphylis. Today is Nick's birthday !!

We didn't get like any snow last night so I had school It was okay I guess first 2 periods I didn't have teachers so I sat in a random class and the cafe. I got caught cheating on a Chemistry tes,t ya fun huh? My teacher was like ""Kristina I'm dissappointed in you, I use to give you extra points and things because I liked you but nope not anymore."" Then he gave everyone a new test because he thought I gave everyone else the answers. Ugh I frigin hate school, except the fact my Spanish teacher was out yesterday and today and is going to be out for the next couple days I think : ] Freddy is taking me to Wendy's after track (I think) so I can eat before dancing tonight. I'm goin tanning with Brittany after dancing too. Hopefully this week at dancing is better than last week when I wanted to murder Shelia.

Ugh It's so cold out

Friday is the MC Winterball : ]
Thursday I'm going to get my nails done with Alexis
and I think after the winterball me and Brittany are sleeping at Alexis's woooo!"

<b>Today-</b> School went by pretty fast. EVERYONE was talking about Jenna's party and two of my teacher's were absent today and I had first lunch. It was a good day : ] I came home and told Matty what I've ben thinking for a while. We broke up because we hardly see eachother and it just felt better as friends. I'm going tanning tonight soon, hopefully. I called Shane and talked to him for a while. We talked about how fast the two years when we were together went by and how fast freshmen and sophmore year went/is going by. We talked about how it feels like yesterday he moved and even though it's ben a little over a year since he moved, we've never lost touch once. I talked to Freddy for a little earlier too. Now I'm talking to Jackieface about a lot and I'm talking to Mike & Nick Silva and Brittany : ]

We're suppose to get a lot of snow tomorrow, I think

"event","<center>The lovely Kylie did my journal for me
: ] She is an amazing person and I'm glad I talk to her
Me and her talked about life today and people who have passed
It made me realize how much I take life for granted and the people in my life
(RIP Brian Raleigh <3 Even though I didn't know him I heard he was an amazing kid)

School was school today
I decided not to leave RHS 
When people found out I might and started telling me how much they were going to miss me
It made me realize my friends are at RHS and I should stay there

Today I got my Spanish 2 book out of my locker
and there was something spilt all over it because we haven't used those books all year
and I opened the book and there was MOLD all over the back yellow, ugly, mold ugh I wanted to throw up
I have to clean it unless I want to pay for a new one and OBV I don't want to pay for a new one

I have so much homework tonight, ugh I think I might die
I never got this much homework in my entire life!!

I was a total scrub in school today but Mark said I looked really pretty
He made me feel better about myself

Today is me and Matty's 2 month
He's an awesome person and makes me so happy
I am so glad I found him : ]

Right now I'm talking to Freddy and Paul online
Freddy is a big loserrrrr : ]~

Paul is one of my new friends I've ben talking to
He's a really nice kid and hopefully we can hang out sometime
He seems like a fun person to be friends with and hang around with

Hmmmm life is strange
I just want everyone in my life to know I love them : ]"

<P><FONT size=4><U><STRONG>Wednesday-</STRONG></U></FONT> I didn't go to dancing, I went to Alexis's house for a while then we went to Ryan's and drove around with Jay Rob Mike and Ryan. We went in Ryan's for a little and went and got Tessa : ] Then me Tess Alexis Ryan Jeana &amp; Rob went inside and hung out for a while then Brittany called me and I had to play mom and have her come to Ryan and Jeana's house because her mom was at my house but at the time we had no idea where she was. So I went outside and waited for Brittany and while waiting for Brittany, Matty came by and I got to see him for a little and Brittany got dropped off and came and sat with us in Matt's car. Then Matt drove me and Brittany to my house and Brittany stayed here for a little then went home.</P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG><U>Thursday-</U> </STRONG></FONT><FONT size=3>Thanksgiving : ] Went to my grandmother's house in Chelsea and ate there and hung out with my cousins for a little. Then came home and went downstairs to my other grandmother's house. Brittany didn't come by to see Dad's side of the family of Thanksgiving, here mom wouldn't bring her. Anyways, me and my Aunt Gina had a nice heart-to-heart convo and I love her : ] Well that was my Thanksgiving, hope yours was good. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG><U>Friday-</U></STRONG></FONT>&nbsp;I stayed in most of the day. Around 5 Brittany came over and Matt Rob and Mike came by and I went outside and saw the new stero system Matt got in his car. It's scary and I can't breathe in the backseat when it's on haha. Me and Brittany tried on some dresses that my cousin brought over but I didn't like any of them. Brittany looked nice in some of them. Then Jackie got dropped at my house. Then Matt, Mike and Rob came and got me real fast to take me by Nikki's to get a dress she was gunna let me borrow but it doesn't fit me. Then I came back home and watched old cheering videos and my dance recital with Jackie and Brittany. Then me and Brittany decided to tell my mom about how I want to go to Pope John and she's calling Monday. Then my mom and Brittany's mom talked about it for a while. Then we went to the boys hockey game. They lost 7-1 but I still love them. After me Brittany and Jackie went out with Lenny and met everyone at Wendy's and Jay hit a tree backing up cuz Chambers picked up throwup off the ground with a spoon and threw it at Jay's car. Ugh, it was disgusting! Then Lenny brought Jackie home and me and&nbsp;Brittany got dropped off at my house and Mike and Matt were outfront of my house so we&nbsp;sat and talked to them until like 12 and went&nbsp;into my house&nbsp;and Brittany slept over.</P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG><U>Saturday-</U> </STRONG><FONT size=3>In the morning me and Brittany tried to get Jay Mike and Rob to take us to IHOP but they wouldn't. Then we called Mark and Freddy but they wouldn't take us either. So we had her mom take us : ] We looked like absolute scrubsssss haha me and Brittany were trying to get out of there without seeing anyone we knew, but we did. Then we went tanning like messes. Brittany went home after and I went home because Brittany had a party. My mom asked me if I wanted to go the mall dress shopping so I called Alexis and we did. We met up with the Delgrecos Matt Jay Mike Simpson Joe and Amanda and saw them for like 10 mins. I found no dresses but me and Alexis got her 3 sisters Christmas presents : ] Then she broke her glasses but luckily we were near Lenscrafters and we got them fixed and saw Chris and Jesse. We gave Chris and Jesse a ride home and Alexis came over. We ate Chinese food and then Ryan Erik and Rob came over. We stayed here for a while and then walked to the trails and no one as there. Then we walked to Ryan's house and met up with everyone. Everyone wanted Mcdonalds so me Matt Alexis Mike Simpson and Joe just sat in Matt's car. Then Matt drove Joe home and me and Alexis to my house. Alexis slept over.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG><U>Sunday-</U></STRONG></FONT> Woke up this morning wicked tired. Sat around with Alexis for a while then she left. I got ready and Mike and Chambers came and got me and we went&nbsp; and met up with Jay Rob Amanda and Joeiny. Me Mike and Chambers went and got Jackie and met up with Matt and then went to eat in East Boston with everyone. Then Chambers dropped me home and I got ready for the hockey game. Jay and Mike came and got me and we all went to Lenny's and Mikey's to meet and follow eachother to this place cuz it is far away somewhere. Lenny was leading us in the front car and we got lost and went South instead of North and ended up in the middle of Boston somewhere and we all lost Lenny and it was Alan's car (Cory Jackie Ryan and Mikey) and Jay's car (Me Rob and Mike). Jay me Mike and Rob drove around aimlessly in Boston and they were yelling things out the window to random people. Then we went to Alexis and Kayla's house but they didn't come out cuz they couldn't. Then we went to Wendy's and KFC. When we were at Wendy's Shane called me and the boys were saying shit about him in the backround cuz he was yelling at me and he flipped out and said ""YOU ARE FUCKED"" and hung up on me. Whatever that means....Then we saw Alan Cory and Mikey at McDonalds and went in there. Then we left McDonalds and Jay drove me home and now I'm here. I called Freddy and talked to him for a little and&nbsp;I have a Spanish test tomorrow and didn't study...Ughhhhh I'm going...</P>"

I don't know what to do anymore I don't know why I get like this
It's not just being aggravated and upset and angry
I get very depressed too and I wish I didn't
I use to be such a happy girl and all of a sudden I'm like someone I'm not

Shane brought this up to me the other day He asked me what was the matter and there was nothing
and he said that I just sound bitchy and pissy lately and I was like no this is how I am and he was like well then I don't know you anymore cuz the girl i use to know was happy all the time

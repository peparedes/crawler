"event","I finally have the strength to move on.  Lara and Karin, the two most level-headed people I know, really gave me some good input tonight. Your words mean everything right now and its appreciated. Thanks guys.  
Its just been proven to me that the people in my life who would rather complain and pick at me and my faults, arent really there anymore.  If this is how they choose to treat and try to ""help,"" me, then I cant deal with it any longer.  Its not as if they even approached me in a friendly way.  A helpful way.  They talked behind my back and thought of every thing they hate about me.  Then they posted it on LJ.  Every mistake I've made was brought up...and according to them they could think of many more.  I dont even care about katlyn, I mean, I never respected anything she said or did and what she wrote today proved every reason for that.  Ive barely talked to her in the past couple of months and for her to bring all this crap up was ridiculous.  I do care about clare.  Theres a lot I respect about her, but tonight just really made me angry.  All their examples were from the past.  ITs time to move on.  Im learning from all this and from what I can tell, they arent.  I've realized that I dont need this negativity.  I wanna be around people who are positive and RESPECT me for who I am and who look  for the goodness in me. As long as im with those positive people, Ill remain happy.  Take a look at your life, are you happy?  What needs to be done in order to fix that?  Finding petty shit to fight about is not my idea of an attempt.  I havent given up yet.  I dont want to be enemies.  But because of this, Im disappointed and Im thinking twice this time. Things will never be the same."

Im ready to leave this place with honor even though I've barely made anything of myself yet its been a good experience so why do I whine continuessly over and over someone slap me please but be prepared to be slapped back.  Im ready to live a little and experience whats out there by traveling and partying and fucking and loving and drawing and studying and smiling and writing and just being able to make myself.  Im going to cry, gonna laugh, gonna lose, gonna yell, gonna curse, gonna kiss, gonna drink, gonna puke gonna smoke, gonna get my fill no matter how bad it hurts no matter how good it feels im gonna enjoy it and hate it and feel it.  Sometimes im an idiot, im serious, im funny, im pretty, im dirty, im ugly, but it doesnt matter, so are you, so is everyone except for destructors who dont know how to be.  Everything comes to an end no matter how hard you try to delay so pass on your wisdom in hope the next generation will listen which is going to be difficult considering this world is getting more and more complicated by the week.  Trends are taking over so eventually this world will be one giant trend and everyone will be the same unless the world continues to have ""different,"" people who have new ideas and new beliefs.  Dogs bark because they want to be heard, cats meow cuz they want to talk to you.  My main mind boggler points toward the sky and beyond into the universe and past places we've never been to and how anything can happen no matter how much you pray and no matter how much control you have, things just happen.  Its beautiful.  Im ready to live, ready to see, ready to smirk, ready to flirt, ready to wed, ready to bare, ready to be me."

So far, the adkins diet is going fine.  I successfully ate chicken salad with lettus for lunch and for a snack later.  For dinner, I had steak, spinach and zuccini.  As long as I leave most of the carbs out of my diet, i can have some later in the week.  Thats what my mom suggests.  Ha. My mom wants me to go to that exercise place for fat people called ""curves.""  Im gonna give it go because as of right now I dont exercise worth shit.

I partied with lara and her portugese friends tonight.  We drank wine, and smoked marijuana.  The night wasnt as joyous cuz they had a lot of catching up to do and i felt a little left out especiaally cuz i dont speak portugese!!!!!!!!!!!1 LOL, but its understandABLE.  im not offended at alll.  Then we went to patricks and drank more and amroe and amore.  so we all bonded pretty well.  I love adreaa and catarina, and rashna or something.  i dont remember her name but she was a cool gal.

People consider it to be the most important year.  Im so worried about the S.a.t.s....I've always had trouble with testing and I dont want to fuck things up for college.  My grandma is in the hospital as well as my step grandfather(her husband)...Having to deal with my parents nagging me about my life and owing them money.  It lowered cuz we discussed it so that helps.  Half the time I feel drained, like Im going nowhere....and the other half Im happy about my life.  
I know life is like this.  Working hard is definitely a factor and its hard to care right now.  
I think Im going to try the adkins diet or however you spell it.  I was talking to courtney and she said its not so bad.  My dad was on it a while ago and he lost 40 pounds in a month.  Ill give it a go.  
Im really enjoying the ""reads"" I have right now.  Lullaby by Chuck Pallahniuk is sensational so far.  I really love the way he writes.  Its detailed but not so much that its boring.  The way he describes people and things is great. ""Choke,"" was a great book too.  Both very entertaining.  Im also reading the great gatspy in english class.  I never thought I would be a reader cuz as a child i was lazy as shit and a couch potato.  

You know when you cant think of the right word to either describe something or express how you feel?  You've got the right idea in your mind but you just cant release it.  I hate that...it happens to me all the time so i just say nevermind.  

I need change.  I need to meet more people.  I want to do something different for a while rather than the same old routine ive been doing for years.  Things have definitely changed over the years but Im anxious and bored.  BOREDOM has finally set in.

Most of my friends dont think hes attractive, which frankly, is fine with me.  He is extremely goodlookin' to me however.  The way he carries himself is so badass i just want to be wild and crazy with him and have sex in wild places! (lol) I am quite the sucker for ""badboys..""  I've always been.  His shaggy blond hair and his adorable face is imprinted in my mind. He likes my kinda music and thats a HUGE plus.  We have pretty good conversation and we flirt sometimes.  I cant tell if hes interested in a 17 year old...yes yes..he is older..what a suprise..  Hes like 22 or 23...which sucks cuz im sure that could be a reason thats holding him back.  Im pretty close to hitting on him im just so afraid that would make things awkward if he didnt feel the same way.  Ah, I need to make things happen with this boy.  I need advice!"

Kern was worried about the drive home from the country so she decided last minute to go to Jessica's.  I wasnt offended, it was a wise decision on her part just incase something happened and we didnt get her home on time.  
So it was just Lara, Toby and me.  We had a fucking blast.  While Toby and Lara ate theirs, I was the sober driver.  We found some random field in Manassas.  When we got there, I ate mine.  
When you're in the country, and you are surrounded by beauty and silence, it sets this mood of reassurence.  It always reminds me of how beautiful this world can be.  And on shrooms, gazing at the stars in the middle of a pine, tree glen is incredible.  
We were all in a great mood, laughing, talking, and awing at the beauty.  I didnt even care if we werent at a party.  I didnt care about anything except how great i felt.  All i wanted to do was break out with laughter and excitement.  
Toby at one point was talking about little dancing vaginas.  Lara took a shit in the wilderness and thought she shit on her hand. She kept asking if she smelled like shit.  
I'll never forget that endless happienss I felt last night.  Thanks guys for making my new years an unforgetable one."

I've been working all weekend as well as tonight.  Saturday threw me against the brick wall when we had a ""technical difficulty.""  With 10 people standing impatienty in the little cubical waiting to pay, and here I am bending over cussing with chris on how to fix the pumps, I felt a little agitated.  Other than that, work is fine.  Im used to the odd customers, so lifes a little easier.  
I've been chilling with Karin and Lara quite a bit.  I get along with those girls very well and I love spending time with them.  They make my life run a little smoother.  
News years is comin up.  The plan for right now is to go to Va beach con toby and Lara.  Karin like stupid whore she is isnt sleeping out.  Im so excited for the outfit I've cleverly chosen.  A green blazor, with my new black skirt and some heels.  Debating on whether to wear fishnets or not.  who knows at this point.  
Oh gawd, we keep seeing that guy Tim everywhere.  He comes by Sunoco every once in a while and it seems we see him all the time in local neighborhoods.  Hes nice and all, but considering i heard he stole money from cler and them, i dont trust him.  Hes a little desperate to hang out with us lately, so Im a little estranged.  
I miss Claire Smalley.  I wonder when she gets back from Spain.  When she gets home, I wanna chill with all the girls...That means everyone...Ali, claire, cler, karin, lara, deady, toby...all you fuckers.  
Played strip poker tonight...aw yea.  Didnt really take off that much, just my socks, shoes and my bra.  Ha.  Patrick was only wearing pants and a shirt.  He claimed he smelled cuz he doesnt like to wear deorderant anymore.  I cringed at the thought.  Lately Ive heard that he thinks Kareen Abdul Jabar and I have unstimulating personalities.  Yea..thats why you are perfectly friendly towards us when we come over...I hate two-faced people man.  I dont want hear that shit from someone else, if you gotta problem with us then say dont play nice say that shit right to our face.  Thats the only way to do it.  
I wonder what the party scene will be like at his house on New years eve.  Probably pretty bumpin'....Im just gonna say sorry for typing that.  It was totally uncalled for.

The chair was comfortable as shit and i just remember dozing a little before the doctors came in.  The nurse put what i thought was an IV in my arm.  Turns out it was the anestecia...(however you spell it) My knockout was very sudden, dont remember a thing...when i woke up, they moved me into this sleeping area.  I dont even remember the ride home or going to my bed.  
All i have to say is that it was a bloody day.  I had to keep these huge hunks of cotton type things in the sides of my mouth for atleast 8 hours or until the bleeding stopped. 
I had to take anti-bacterial pills along with percacet.  After taking all that medication, i felt nautious.  Everytime i stood up, i felt like i was gonna puke.  
I slept the day away.  I didnt do jack shit.  I tried to watch a movie but my mind was too sleepy.  

Today was better.  I took a shower, brushed my teeth and went to get entertainment for me and clare.  We got some vietnamese soup on the way.  We watched, The heathers which was strange but interesting...Trainspotting which i forgotten that id seen but enjoyed thouroughly.  We also watched The doors which was the best movie.  It was filled with drugs, sex and rock n roll....oh yeaaaaaaaaa....Val Kilmer was really amazing in it.  I definitely underestimated him as an actor.  Clare and I had been laughing all day cuz of our medication...laughing in pain i might add....we would burst out laughing because of something we did or said, then grab our jaws with a gasp pleading to stop with the jokes.  It was hilar. We ran in to aaron, epolito, james, nick and mikey at the bowling alley...we were walking to 711...we chilled with them covering our faces most of the time.  We looked mentally challenged when we laughed.

It was a girls night.  Karin, Clare, me and courtney atfirst.  Then we picked up lara.  I had work for an hour at 6, but then we all went to nick's brother's apartment.  Every 5 minutes someone would say, ""im so glad u are here,"" or ""I love you so much,"" to courtney.  The HIGHlight of my evening was when we went to Giant.  First of all, we had been taking pictures all night on karin's camera as well as courtney's.  I grabbed two melons and held them up to my chest as if they were my massively large boobs....Snap. Picture...then karin held the pinapple above my held, along with the melons. Snap.  (keep in mind this was a friday night, it was crowded)  Then we put oranges over our eyes...then the cucumbers with the radishes which looked like a vegitale penis.  IT was sooo hilarious and i bet we made asses out of ourselves.  

We must have hugged her a dozen times before she went up to her door.  She was crying as well as some others.  I didnt though, i was sad as hell, but i didnt cry.
I love her so much, she has so many tight bonds with all her friends.  I wish the best for her which is pointless, cuz i know she'll make it by herself.

After hanging out with courtney with everyone being so happy and all, we returned to our normal hectic, dramatical nights.  It depresses me to see all my friends breaking away.  Soon it will just be me and karin.  Clare might be leaving too...Atleast they will get to have a good change in their lives.  I only wish the best for my girls.  I love you all."

My mom is an anxious person and talks my fucking head off...which is chill sometimes, cuz atleast she is interested in whats going on my life.  Shes smaller than me, and is rotund and cute:) Whenever its late, or early, and if she is in a good mood...(ex. xmas eve)she acts so crazily....omg..this one time, she crept down the stairs with a blanket on her back when i was on the computer and said in this creepy wisper, ""You dont know anything...""  Then she burst out laughing...  
When I was little, she would wake me up by bursting in my room estaticly singing opera imitations of ""good mornin, you are my princess..""  
Its funny though, shes got this really great laugh...its a teasy mischievious laugh.  I have it too, but not nearly as bad.  Shes really nice when she wants to be, which is quite common, and shes a big old bitch when she wants to be.  Shes nosey, but concerned, shes rude, yet she respects me, and shes hilarious.  
I've always gotten really annoyed with her, especially the older i get.  Most of questions she ask are soo annoying, and she'll disallow something for no reason sometimes.  I feel so horrible because of the way i treat her.  I tend to get reeally impatient towards her and ""hurt her feelings.""  No matter how annoying she is, I really do love her, and i dont want her to be unhappy.  
I called her today to see what was up with my broken phone, and she sounded so depressed.  She told me how she got rid of the rug in my bro's room cuz of the animals pissing there.  She seemed so bummmed and stressed and made me realize that im a fucking brat.  I need to change that about me, I need to be more patient and understanding.  It seems I hurt her a lot, cuz i never talk to them anymore, i just come home from work, go online, fight with them about something, and then go to bed.  My parents are lonley and that kills me.  I dont look forward to this stage in my children's adolesence.  
My Dad is big, brilliant polar bear.  He is so level headed it makes me want to puke.  He can be a little irrational sometimes but thats only because he worries about me.  He can be really sweet, and do nice things for me, and then he can be the scariest bastard ever.  When he gets mad he raises his voice and that has always scared me.  He has never hit me in such a way that i would declare it abuse, but he has slapped me once or twice on the mouth...but not without feeling horrible about it.  The only time hes spanked me was when i chased my bro around the house with a butcher knife...lol..thats all i can remember anyways..
He did cry once, I remember feeling, even as a todler, so crushed that my daddy was sad.  My brother and I used to fight so much, and finally, he just sat down and bursted into tears.  My brother and I huddled around him and comforted him saying we wouldnt ever do it again.  And ofcourse we did.  
Both my parents are very concerned about school, and very involved with what is going on in that department.  They do not approve of c's,even though i get a c almost every quarter...but they still are lenient...like some of my other friends, their parents would ground them if they got like a b-...thats ludacris..
Im gonna treat them with more respect, im sure we will still argue, but that is normal.  Im just sick of being so agitated at them all the time.
It will be hard though, because when i do get in fights with them, i get really emotional...i tend to take all my stress out on them and thats why i treat them so poorly...The things they say really get to me, and they have control of so much that when they take it away, i become unstable and upset.  Its something i must work on. 

Courtney is back in town and I hope to see her on friday, right after school, i cant wait!  
Adios."

Soft music playing in the background, whatever music I want to listen to, all I have to do is think about it.  The ground would be the equivilant of clouds, except they are hot pink.  Money doesnt mean jack shit...everyone has an endless amount of one thing, and they actually share.  I would have an endless amount of hats, or maybe sunglasses....cute little rabbits would roam around, but they are made out of chocolate, and when you take a bite, they  smile.  Everyone is treated like an adult, no one controls anyone.  Hiphop and pop are banished and anyone who mentions them will be prosicuted.  Bone thugs, fieldy's dreams and some others are exceptions.  Music will take the place of religion.  Rather than learning about ""god"" people will go to church to praise music and the other wonders of the world.  Sushi (california rolls)will be served in every restraunt, as well as any drug we want.  My cat buster will be my eternal partner, by myside at all times.  School will be optional.  falls church Police?  Whats that?  Everyone is beautiful, doesnt matter how, just everyone is considered beautiful.  Bugs become extinct, except butterflies, lady bugs, praying mantices, and....dragon flies...

"event","god man, this morning I was on my way to writing a nice long sucessful journal about my weekend....ofcourse my mom, being as bored as she was snuck up behind me and read over my shoulder....the part she read::  ""tim kept coming by, offering to buy us more, i told him to call around 730ish cuz we would need another run.""  The first thing that came out of her mouth was...""ARE YOU ON DRUGS AGAIN?""  I was like what the fuck...get away, and stop your ease-dropping woman.  She started analyzing what it meant and i finally told her that it was for alcohol....shes gets my dad involved and it blew up into this huge fight.  Freaking out, I exited out of my entry and ran upstairs.  It really fucking frustrated me.  I had only gotten a few hours of sleep, i had a hangover and to top it all off with a big fucking cherry, i had to shovel my goddamn walkway...which is the hardest thing ever because the bricks are all uneven and its nearly impossible to scoop the snow up.  Gr, Karin made it better though when i picked her up for starbucks.  we got a coffee and saw jack lanouette there...he is sooo sexy and cute.  I kinda have a thing for him now.  He was ranting on about the dimmu concert and how he knows the band members and how he emails them all the time...it was funny cuz karin and i established that jack and me had the same convo like 3 times. He kept bringing up the same shit that he had said beforehand.  Karin told me to ask for his number but i chickened out, i was still in a mopey mood compared to my intoxicated flirty mood.  
Karin and I then journeyed to Linda's cafe.  Had ourselves some nice juicy burgers and were suprised to see a lot of attractive men there....we were blushing like bashful the dwarf...hahaha...thats a horrible simile.  We were listing every hookup and every kiss we've had...haha, it was so funny cuz we were talking like the loud people we are and making ourselves sound really skanky.  Unintentionally tho.  

I threw up so much last night.  I drank a lot though so i guess i had what was coming.  I was trashed....Right before i threw up, i tried lying down and drinking water but that gave me body rushes and made me feel really ill...So it was off to the bathroom.  I went back and forth like 3 times...god i hate the feeling of having to puke but cant get it up...it makes me cringe.

God, I have so much to do this week.  I really need access to my bank account so i can get presents for my loved ones...Where to go first....Im also dying my hair this week...karin will be the proud stylist...Im sure clare will be there to help too.  Im thinking neon purple tips...hot right?  Hopefully its not too teeny bopper.  I also need a haircut before i do the dye job.  Ha, that reminded me when I went to a football game at the school a couple of years ago and asked for a blow job instead of a blow pop....that was funny as all hell.  
Hmm, what else...Ill be wrapping up this week at school so its gonna be a little hectic with school work anyways...

The dimmu show last thursday was incredible.  Clare and I had a blast.  By far the best show ive ever been to.  Dimmu Borgir and children of bodom fucking blew us away.  It was the first show where i actually danced and head banged....im sure i looked like a fool but i had a blast and thats all that matters right?  It was so funny cuz we were right outside the mosh pit and this fucking asshole(hot asshole) fell into me and then grabbed my boobs...No mistake either. I hate that shit, he got what was coming tho because i pushed his ass, hard.  

Wow, long entry...Im going to sleep early tonight ladies and gentlemen...NiNi."

One of the most annoying things is people come up to the window(outside) and think they need to pay through the metal slot....which we used 5 YEARS AGO!!  You wouldnt believe how long it takes for some of these morons to get that you need to come inside and pay....even if im scooping my hand in circles like a mad man, they still dont understand...and the funniest part is...they think i can hear them...so here they are, talking to themselves for 2 minutes before they realize they need to come inside...AH.  
I met a very odd fellow tonight at the station.  He walked really fast in his athletic wear including the white sweat band.  He had really thick glasses and a jersey accent.  He was awkward and middleaged.  Interrupting me from my book, he asked for directions to 495.  Thinking this was going to be quick, I simply said up the road.  But no.  He had to tell me all about his unbelievable career in the courier business...about how you could make so much money...I pretended to be amazed, bulging my eyes and all...he went into so much detail that i was really starting to get annoyed...during the period of time I decided to ignore him, i imagined drawing the shapes on his face...so i did.  he was literely blabbering for 20 minutes talking about shit.  when he finally left, guess who showed up.  The born again christian who confronts me with his problems all the time as well.  Hes actually not that bad..hes pretty kooky tho...""hello rachel, its nice to see you today..whats new in your life...anything..anything??""  what a kook.  

My grades arent doing that great...I got a fucking c on my history test which should have been an A.  I feel stupid lately...I hate being absent minded first of all...Today we went to amoco and Lara asked me to buy her a pack of ciggs.  I went in with her 10, bought some food and totally forgot about her ciggs...when I came back to the car she asked about them and I didnt even have her 10...turns out I dropped it in the store while bobbling a bunch of things.  How pathetic is that....whatever.
I need to get out of this town.  Its really starting to get to me.  I need to get away from everything.  Im so sick of school.  Im sick of my repetetive fucking routine.  work, eat, sleep, school.

It was Patrick's birthday and he had a pretty large party ..  Lara, karin, tobes, jess and I went and there were a lot of people from all over...I love mary!  Mary is this awesome chick who I only see when we are both really drunk. Everytime we see eachother we get so excited to see eachother.  I remember her saying something like we'd probably hate eachother if we were sober....probably.  but shes a funny gal.  I like most of the people who show up at patrick's.  Its really interesting to see the variety of people around this area.  
When Im drunk, I have this habbit of walking around to every group of people and saying some drunken comment.  Most people do that but Im the queen.  I love it though...I get so fucking happy when im drunk...I always hug my girls and find other people to hug...its one big huggin partae...
Toby and I stumbled out for a walk to see some crazily decorated house down the street.  Im such a dumbass, I stole the ""santa, stop here!"" stop sign thingy...actually I broke it in half and stole the top part...lol...I then continued to walk around patrick's house with it saying...you betta believe that mutha fucka Santa is stoppin here tonight...hahaaa
Then I took Karin, and drez home...man that kid is crazy....hes funny as hell when hes drunk but that man hits on anything that walks...jesus.  hes a sleeze man....  Lara and I proceded to IHOP!  got some damn good sandwiches and gay adam was our waiter!  man I love him!!! he is sooo coool, we were tlaking to him about our night and everything...Ihop is the chillest place to go if you want a bite to eat...and you are messed up...they dont give a flying fuck as long as you arent puking or making a scene.  Adam gave us free corn pancakes, which were delicious...I love him!!!!!
Got back to patrick's  and fucking crashed on this shrimpy little couch...so uncomfortable...i moved to floor but that was worse....THEN i moved to this comfy chair and by that time i couldnt go back to sleep.   it was like 930 in the morning....plus these two motherfuckers also sleeping in the living room had the worst goddamn pig snoring ive ever heard... If only clare was with me so we could have laughed about it....I wish you were there babe!
I feel like going to starbucks today and just lounging around...with some coffee....a good book....and kern and clare or some others....i think ill do that...bye yall."

Today, I was forced to go to the worst store I have ever been to...Chicos.  It was over-priced grandma shit that I would never buy.  My aunt bought me this expensive jacket there for my bday.  I couldnt bare to wear so we went back, and got store credit...I felt so out of place shopping with other middle-aged women.  I was a little worried at first because I was afraid of having to tell my aunt that I didnt want anything...But they did have some rather nice accessories...And spending all the store credit wasnt a problem considering individual necklaces were like 40-50$.  I got this gorgeous scarf, these really nice sunglasses, a necklace and a white tank top.  Im satisfyed.  

My dad and mom are sick now in addition to all my friends.  Lets hope Im lucky and dont get sick...Ill be pissed if I do considering I was sick recently.  

I cant wait for this weekend.  Its Patrick's bday and hes having a party.  Hopefully Toby will be hookin it up with shrooms and we'll all be one, big happy family.  I will be really happy if she is successful.  Shrooms are so amazing in how they make everything beautiful.  I remember this one time, we were at Jasmin's...and we were doing shrooms for the first time.  Her shower curtain was this rainforesty waterfall type painting...We all crammed in her bathroom to gaze at the flowing water.  It was as if everything is breathing.  They make me sooooo happy and I cant wait."

I find myself hating it now, more than ever....I think to myself...everytime I smoke, I feel like shit...Im uneasy...paranoid...just not okay..Atfirst, I was going to ""cut down,"" keep it to the weekends...but I now know that I have to fucking stop this.  I've been thinking about this for a while.  I have only a little bit of support from my friends and thats the hardest part. Smoking took over our lives and for those who can handle it, more power to ya. My best buddies smoke all day every day...whenever they get the chance...Either Im going to have to get the fucking will power to stop, or sever myself away from my friends...and I cant do that...I cant.  I love them too fucking much to do that. I never thought or knew marijuana would make me feel this way.

It was creepy as hell smoking in there, we were surrounded by these huge, bone colored marbel tombs.  Not to mention the GIANT manora on the other side of us.  Im talkin huge...like a house!  It was possibly the chillest place Ive ever smoked.  No one really in sight and itis a huge property.  I walked around the tombs just to see how chill it was in the distance and I felt stange.  As if I was in slow motion, while its dead silent.  Almost a hollow sensation.  I returned to the group quiet, with only a few thoughts.  An odd event, wouldnt you say?
Before the cemetery, I went out to lunch with my family. We went to the Hickory Grill, and would you believe, they forgot my chipotle sauce!  I was astounded.  haha.

The funny thing is, I catch myself thanking god sometimes...But I also catch myself shunning religion....The point is, I just dont know...There are some amazing things in this world that just dont seem possible without a god.  But then again, why does he allow fucked up things to happen, like war, crime, starvation...a lot of shit...Im confused about everything...  By the time I die, I hope to discover the real truth about this world..I want to know who is controlling us....who made us.....who destroys us..."

"event","Journey to my palace,
Dance with my fluorescent mariposa.
Absorb this bliss,
but keep it subrosa.

Inhale my colombian crystal,
Drink my ruby rose wine.
Witness my sparkling pistol,
and cry me your sunshine tears of divine.

Sail through my pure, velvet sky,
Cradle my angelic resin baby, lure him closer.
Scream pleasure within, explode with a cry,
But keep it hidden, keep it subrosa.

Climb up my liquid ladder,
Rest in my pink cloud mamosa.
Drop everything that matters,
But keep it subrosa.

"event","It hurts.  I got my industrial today.  Im, in a way, glad I got it done, but then again, it needs a lot of attention.  I just know Im going to be knocking it around.  Combing my hair, putting on shirts, showers, and me forgetting that it's there will all be challenges.  Also, the balls are rather large and I tend to like smaller earrings.  Whatever, Im glad I got it done and I'll clean it regularly so its nice and healthy:) 
    I am so fucking excited for Thanksgiving!  Stuffen, mashed po-tay-tos, turkeh, get in mah belleh!!  Cant forget that gravey..We are cedlebrating Thanksgiving at my house which will be nice cuz we havent in quite some while...

"event","Well, my birthday is over and I had a pretty good night....First of all, the whole day was pretty damn good.  I didnt really expect to get balloons and flowers or anything but I did!  It was nice to receive all those things.  Also, deady decorated my car with signs that said ""birthday girl!"" ,""If you want to learn how to fly, you gotta fuck with the eagles.."" and ""Get out my way!"" She also put bows all over the interior which was cute!  It was fun getting dirty looks all day!  hahaha...To celebrate my bday with my family, we went out to eat then i opened presents and LEFT for the hotel.  Atfirst the hotel party sucked because everyone was having a shitty time and I pissed off some people.  I was so pissed off atfirst cuz i paid 80 bucks for that room and everyone was going home at one point....I would have been so disappointed if everyone left...I was distracted in the car and accidently called karin's house rather than her cell and her mom picked up, i thought it was karin so i was like whats the room number? well it wasnt karin, it was her mom...so yea that sucked soooo when she called back i was like sorry it was a wrong number...her mom asked who it was and i said ""angela,"" in a really bad english accent...apparently i said karin so her mom knew it wasnt a wrong number and called karin to bitch...Thats what took everyone's good mood away so it bothered me....but right when everyone left, and it was just Toby, me, Lara and clare....we started talking our heads off....we were like, wait a minute...lets have a fucking amazing night tonight...we have a bath tub full of beer...a little bit of bud...so lets just have an awesome time.  And we did.  We all got pretty drunk and went to Oasis, well Toby didnt cuz of dan, but clare, lara and I did.  We ""tranced,"" our way over to the hooka bar and had some mango sheesha....It was mighty tastey...People became restless so we went to Ihop...Ironically, jonny, who no one cared to hang out with was there with Drez...That was awkward cuz we had to lie to them aboutt he room and they knew we were lying.  Crack and hippo showed up too...We arranged for them to come back to the room to smoke with us...they called shortly after to get directions....It was the most annoying situation cuz that motherfucker didnt know where the hell he was....we ended up having an argument over whether there was a lee highway East....someone in their right fucking mind should know about Lee hwy east damnit...Im pretty sure he was fucked up ...Toby and dan didnt want them there so they told them that they couldnt come anyways...crack threw a tantrum and hung up...Fucking baby.  I refuse to hang out with that rude piece of shit again...So I drank a lot more, smoked a lot more with Dan, clare and Toby...The dan I know is this pissy guy who gets mad at everything toby does, butlast night he was drunk and VERY friendly...hahaha, he poured beer all over the bible and got it on the bed and my jacket...we drew on the wall behind this picture frame....lol, some random scary face and ""stony Bonies...""  Last night, over all was a 6 out of 10...I love my girls so much!  Thanks for making it a wonderful night!  I am so excited for my industrial tomorrow, there will be mucho pain but Ill surrive...I think Im going to go take a nap...Adios chicanos"

I'll be 17....what a boring age...I mean 16 is pretty important because of the whole license fascination...and 18 is an important age cuz of clubbing, but 17 is one of those ages that is pointless.

Thankfully, things are starting to look hopeful again cuz we are renting a hotel room.  Meh, not too bad, it will be fun!  Im rackin up the doe from the relatives, thats always great.

On Sunday August 19 I will be officially 7 months pregnant and I will have 12 more weeks to go. Im starting toget tired of being pregnant cuz thats all everyone thinks about. The well being of my son. I hate it. I love my son but it can get really aggravating that everytime I see my mother, she always says ""wheres the jake?"" and i have to waddle to her office so she can give my belly a kiss. Thats whats driving me crazy. And everyone I sell soemthing to asks me ""hows your pregnancy going?"" i always reply with ""great i love being pregnant"" Its just killing me is what its doing.

Matts always driving me crazy as well. I ask him, will you talk to Jake and he said he feels like its a one sided convo but if he didnt talk to him, will the baby know that matt is daddy? I dont know. I ask matt to do stuff and he does it but he hesitates or procrastinates doing it. why? oh why? well I have to get back to my daily bunch of shit at work. oh yay!

They had to stick me with 4 needles just to get the IV in me. It sux ass. Now my arms are sore from that. And then Dr. Z prescribed Zofram for me and I was supposed to get it yesterday but they dont have the generic kind. I want somehting else. im not paying $225 for fucking medicine.

"event","Please Pray
Current mood: pleased

I ask that each and everyone of you, no matter what race, religion, anything that you  are, that you please pray for me. I have had a rough couple of days.

Story behind it all:

Ok on Saturday I went with my mom and dad and my in-laws to Indiana to visit my grandparents and get some good homegrown veggies from their farm.  Mm good veggies. Well that night I got home and I was fine until about midnight. matt and i had been laying in bed. I couldnt get to sleep and I started having trouble breathing. My heart was beeating like amillion times a minute, i started to throw up, my vision went blurry. I was having a panic attack. I called my mother at 12:30 am and itook 2 aleve to make me sleep. Well that worked but the next day i was having trouble breathing still. it didnt help that i was on a boat out on lake michigan watching the air and water show. I get sick on boats. Luckily that didnt happen that day. Well lets just say monday i went to the doctor. They gave me xanax. Im happy but Ive had 5 in the past 29 hours. and its not good. I am going to the psychiatrist tomorrow for my depression and to tell him of these panic attacks. Its getting really bad and im afraid that they wont stop. I dont want to depend on the Xanax to help me. But if thats what it takes then i will have to deal with them.

I just ask each and everyone of you to pray for me. You can ask me any questions that you like.. I love comments. I am not doing this for attention. I have a loving husband who told me i should blog on it. He and my family and friends are worried about me. But please just pray for me that i get better and that I feel better. Well its time to take the meds and go back to sleep.

Gnite

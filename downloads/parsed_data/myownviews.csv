My Nana and Paw-Paw made turning 20 and all the things I've been through along the way worth it.
On my Birthday they gave me a bunch of pictures of me and my parents through out the years. It was awesome to look at those and actually remember how things were back then. It made me feel better and worse at the same time. Better b/c I could actually see proof of happiness. Worse b/c I couldn't remember those times without the pictures. It's sad when you can only remember what things were like yesterday and not just a few years ago. 
But now I can look at those pictures whenever I'm unable to remember better times.

They also gave me my Uncle Joe's scrapbooks that he made before he died. I think they knew that I would appreciate them the most.
And to add to the thoughtfulness that went into these gifts, they gave me 2 Johnny Cash, 3 Dolly Parton, 3 Merle Haggard albums... all on Vinyl.

"event","let's just talk about this for a minute...
I've actually had a pretty decent day, with the exception of my anxiety.
I had lunch with my cousin and the most amazing canadian ever. 
Attended a family gathering. Those are always interesting and awesome.
And I actually finished my final exam papers before 1am.
I'm good.

I've been having chest pains a lot today, more than the usual.

i've been doing things, listening to songs, watching movies, going places, and wearing clothes that remind me of everything...
i love remembering.

tonight i ran a red light, and it wasn't a light that had just changed. it was red for at least 20 seconds. i could have easily been killed, but the road was deserted. 
there are reasons for everything.

i have plans.
several.

"event","sometimes you do things, mainly acting on impulse, and then you don't understand why you did whatever it was that you did. you won't and you never will.

you make a bed for yourself and then all you can do is lay in it.
that bed is usually messy and you should probably get up and make it, but you are too comfortable and you just want to lay there even if it isn't a perfect place.

"event","What makes people do that stupid maneuver in crosswalks at grocery stores, intersections, ect... 
it's like a twist of the hips and a shuffling of the feet. People walk very slowly and then once they get about halfway across they do that stupid ""walk fast, stop"" for about 2 seconds, and then they start walking extremely slow again.

If your going to walk slow. Walk slow.
If your going to walk fast. Walk fast the entire time!

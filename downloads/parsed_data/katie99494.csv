"event","NewSource 15 is kicking my butt. I got my first compliment from one of my professors tonight who said he liked my news story. Yay! It was such a fun story to shoot, and I loved doing the interviews. I guess I just like getting to know people.

I had a wonderful networking opportunity yesterday with an informational interview. She lives in Nashville and was a UGA J-School grad. Things are looking up. And a PR firm called me, so I have an intv with them next Friday. At least if I never find a job, I have a lot of cool contacts up in Nashville. 

This weekend is my chorus concert, which I'm looking forward to. Mom and Dad are coming up on Saturday. Chris can't make it, which is disappointing, but what can ya do. I guess work for a PhD is more important than a Women's Glee Club reunion. (That's a joke...)

Ok, I'm going to bed. I'm super tired."

I'm giving LiveJournal a try, thanks to Ethan. I liked xanga for its simplicity, but he swears this is quite comparable. And I would agree, based on his examples. Maybe I just hate changing to something I'm unfamiliar with.

Spring Break was incredible. I visited Nashville and never wanted to come home. I had the opportunity to hand deliver 4 resumes and cover letters, and got one response for an automatic interview. I also received three rejection letters from CMT; they were for jobs I was not qualified for, but I applied anyway. Still disappointing to receive any kind of rejection letters. I remember my last official ""rejection letter"" was from the UGA Honors program, telling me I was on probation until my grades came up after first semester, freshman year. Imagine a world where a 3.4 was just not good enough. haha. I posted that letter, however, next to my computer and it served as a reminder that there was stuff I needed to improve upon.

I also got to spend some time with Chris. Corny jokes and all. We flew a kite on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, grilled out with his friends, went bowling (where I kicked butt...no, not really), watched ""Starsky and Hutch,"" and literally just chilled. That was the best part. Just relaxing. And I got to see my CMT friends--- I wish I could be up there all the time. They had a ""Dancing Outlaw"" party--- apparently, it's a hilarious and crazy program that makes fun of backwoods country folk. Wish I could have been there for that.

I had nightmares (again) about NewSource 15. Literally woke up in the middle of the night, worrying I was a reporter and I couldn't get my stuff done on time. And then I had another dream about my photographer not coming in on time. I hate being anxious for that class! I'm praying someone will switch with me so I don't have to be a reporter ever again.

But other than that, I have an exciting weekend to look forward to. I'm going up to Nashville again to visit. YAY!!! And...I get to go to the Nashville Kats arena football game!!!! So...I'm taking one day at a time! :)"

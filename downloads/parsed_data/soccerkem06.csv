"event","<P>Few Days ago i went to Erics house and we went Jet Skiing then the Campbells showed up and i took Eric and Scotty on the jet Ski and only flipped us once. Then on Tuesday i had Heather over to go tubing and woah was that fun the waves were HUGE. then we had pizza and almost made ourselves sick because we ate too much. Then on Wed. i had Monica over and we went fishing and tubing.. thwn i drove the Jet Ski and we tried to run over a bird on the water. That was pretty fun. Then Yesterday i didnt really do anything until around 9 Heather called saying she was having a little get together so i rhode my bike over there and when i got there her sister Amy was moving this big trash bag which was really heavy so it broke obviously knowing me i looked what was in there and it was a TON of new books she was throwing away so heather and i sat down on the ground and started reading the books...then we went inside and i helped Amy move a big shelf out of her room..then Heather me Rachael Larissa Paige and someone else went swimming it was so fun! then my mom came to get me at 11:15 and i went home and watching Finding Nemo before i went to bed. now i'm writing all this and its getting kinda boreing so i'm gunna go fishing again and go get my Bike and Towel that i left at Heathers</P>

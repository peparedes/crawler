There are only two things to worry about<br>
Either you are well or you are sick<br>
If you are well, there is nothing to worry about<br>
If you are sick there are two things to worry about<br>
Either you will get well or you will die<br>
If you get well there is nothing to worry about<br>
If you die there are only two things to worry about<br>
Either you will go to heaven or hell<br>
If you go to heaven there is nothing to worry about<br>
If you go to hell.... you'll be so damn busy shaking hands with friends, you wont have time to worry!<br>

"event","i havent left an entry in here for a while, or at least a public one. i guess i havent because i dont really feel like getting into personal matters in a livejournal. your probably asking yourself than why do i have one? good question i dont know. not everything in here though has to be personal. or even really imporant. 
i really cant wait til i get my licence, i know its still kind of early to be thinking about that cause i still have to wait til february. when i get it though, i know im going to go for a lot of drives. just get in the car at night and drive for a while. i dont know theres just something about driving in a car, listening to music thats just kind of relaxing to me. i dont know. no destination just go. 
i guess thats all i feel like saying. 



the present is just a pleasent interruption to the past"

plans with my friends kinda fell through, = /.. again, but thats ok.
hanging out with them tomorow and wednesday. REALLY looking forward to
cedar point on thursday with blake and the jeffs. It should be alot of
fun, dragging jeff on all the rides hes too afraid to ride on will be
funny as hell lol (im not sitting with him, he might throw up or
something) they went there last year and i was invited to go, but i was
up north.. really glad i didnt too, it was the day of the huge
blackout... damn that would be scary stuck on top of rollercoasters for
hours and hours.. hopefully that wont happen this time lol .. nothing
really happening on friday either, maybe il try to convince my dad we
should go golfing or something... Then saturday im hanging out with
kelly at her house, watching the shinning, not the damn 6 hour one we
tried to watch last time, lol wow that was a bad movie.&nbsp; well i
guess thats all for now, kellys inspired me to go run later on today
and try running everyday.. or maybe every other day.. yeah that sounds
good- <br>
<br>
well im off to go listen to some music <br>

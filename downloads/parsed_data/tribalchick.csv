"event","Hello everyone!<br />So it's been a while. Winter has been a little slow compared to Summer as far as business goes, but it's still going. We now have three steady students, all of whom are very talented. Right now we're rehearsing a new choreography for the whole troupe, as well as basic training. January 18th was Bellyfest, and there's quite a dizzying story for that one. Originally, we were all going to do Entrance of the Stars, but then it turns out one of our students wasn't getting enough practice in, so we switched to a choreography for three people (Aahat). But then shortly after we started rehearsals for that one, something came up for our other girl. So it was down to Mom and I. After talking to Nadiyah (who organized the event) we decided we would do two solos, a Hawaiian fusion and a short hula (The theme this year was winter luau). As soon as we started going over that one, I got sick with mono (that was killer). We thought we were going to have to cancel and have Mom just do her solo, because just a few days before the performance I could hardly walk due to fatigue and muscle pain. But three days before the performance I was feeling well enough to do it. Then Mom got sick with a flu-like virus barely a day before the performance. (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Irony</span>!) So it turns out, I did my solo to Lirrilli, and I did the hula by myself at the end. Here is a picture of me before <a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://bp2.blogger.com/_CU5tXl0LAPU/R6wp7KdkX9I/AAAAAAAAAJU/vNbIzNnJhEE/s1600-h/Bellyfest.jpg""><img border=""0"" style=""margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 264px; height: 353px;"" src=""http://bp2.blogger.com/_CU5tXl0LAPU/R6wp7KdkX9I/AAAAAAAAAJU/vNbIzNnJhEE/s320/Bellyfest.jpg"" alt="""" id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5164548969084510162"" /></a>the performance (just before I took my glasses off), and I should have a video soon! I was still quite tired from the mono, and I was coughing a bit as well. I think I did pretty well considering my state of health, but I wish I could have enjoyed it more. About halfway through my nose started running a tiny bit, so I was breathing through my mouth. But that caused my throat to close up and I was having a very hard time breathing right near the end. I think I managed alright, though. When I did the hula piece, I felt ok, but I felt weird doing it by myself. I realized a little late that I needed to change, so I ran backstage and changed as fast as I could, but in the process I forgot to take my glasses off. Hopefully no one noticed. So, after the show was over, a very talented dancer named Talia came up to me and asked if I'd like to be in her show May 16th! I'm quite excited about it. It's at the Sons of Norway Ballroom, and it has a raised stage and lighting. Woohoo! I just decided on my music. I'll be using Moon Over Ala Nar. It's quite a fun, upbeat song. If you want to come see me dance, it should be quite an exciting show! Talia is bringing out dancers from all over the West Coast, as well as some of the best local dancers around. I hope you'll all be there!<br />In other news, I'll be turning 17 this March, which means in a year I can try out for the BDSS again! Woohoo! Also, we <span style=""font-style: italic;"">may</span> decide to drive down to Rakassah this year, which would be amazing. Road trip! I don't think we'll be doing the St Patrick's Day Parade as planned. It's just too cold! Other possible events in the coming year include the Lilac Parade, Valleyfest, the Halloween Hafla and INDA's Dancefest (and I'm sure more will come up). Keep your eyes peeled for that video, and I'll keep you all posted on upcoming events!"

"event","Hello everyone! We're home!
It's the most amazing thing to be here . . . to know that this is where I belong - I'm home! You know you're truly in the right place when everything just happens for the best on its own. Everything with the business has just been falling into place! These past two weeks have been more productive, exciting and fun than the past two years in Hawaii! So where do I start?
When we first got back to Spokane we did moving stuff - check out the house, get our unaccompanied baggage, that sort of thing. But things started happening on the third. We went to a local Greek restaurant called Azars. It's run by a Greek family, just this little hole in the wall kind of place, and they have bellydancing every Friday. While we were there, the dancer (Shaheena) asked us to come up and dance, and afterwards Katy (the owner) offered us a job! We talked with Shaheena and she was cool (don't want to step on anyone's toes) and Katy said if she didn't contact us by September to call her. We'll be working on Saturdays starting in September. It's not officially official yet, but I'd say it's pretty safe to say we'll get the job.
So, the next day we went to the Highland Games, where we got in touch with the local renaissance group, Urar Tiene. We'll be dancing with their gypsies every Tuesday at Franklin Park, as well as at other events. :D (we've already been twice) At the Highland Games we also met several potential students, and not to mention amazing vendors. ;)
So on the seventh we hooked up with Urar Tiene for their monthly business meeting and we learned about their system and met all kinds of people. They were very excited about the dancing and four of the ladies wanted to dance with us. So we said that next week we would bring music and hip scarves. And everyone cheered. (yay!) The rest of that week we were pretty darn busy with home improvements and cleaning, but we did lots of planning and plotting. ;)
On the thirteenth we had our most important date. When we were still in Hawaii we had contacted Dance Emporium, a local dance studio, about teaching bellydance lessons, and they said to come by and set things up. But when Monday rolled around, we encountered a problem. The car had just arrived in Seattle, and Dad and Griff had to go pick it up. So we thought we'd reschedule for Tuesday. But our new neighbor was extremely generous and offered to drive us down! (Thanks again!) So we went off to the studio, which is just a few streets down from us. When we got there we were very impressed. The studio was huge! They had a wonderful office and tons of dance and martial arts supplies in the front. We met up with the lady we talked to over the internet before, and she showed us around. When we went into the actual dance space, I almost fell over. It's absolutely huge, and it's decorated with beautiful inspirational images. I was so thrilled. After that we sorted out all kinds of paperwork and talked business. She said we'd have to get personal liability insurance, which we took care of today. More on that later. I'm trying to stay true to the time line. ;)
So yesterday (Tuesday) we went down the Franklin park to meet with Urar Tiene again, and we brought the Bose (which was half broken in the move; the right speaker's treble is broken. Grr), hips scarves and various gypsy-ish instruments. before we knew it, we had five ladies hop up, grab a hip scarf and join us! All of them were already somewhat experienced in bellydance and most of them were quite flexible. It was a lot of fun, and we danced two hours away. At least three of them, I think, are interested in taking lessons from us. But the exciting news is that we might be doing a wedding! One of the ladies, whom I've seen twice now but don't remember her name, is getting married and asked us if we did weddings! It would be so much fun to do a wedding. Such a happy, beautiful time.
So today we called our insurance company to talk about personal liability insurance. We had to get a different policy, but we're both covered up to a million dollars. So if someone falls in class and breaks their ankle and decides to sue, we don't loose tons of money. So now we can get set up to teach at Dance Emporium, which we should start by September, maybe sooner.
So what else? Uhh, I'm working on a series of articles about different styles of bellydance. I have three finished, but I want to post them when I have four or five. We're also working on other things for the website, so keep your eyes open. Oh, and as soon as these things all solidify (probbly by September) we will update the calender! (We'll also add a sidebar button so people can find the calender easier)
So! I just had to update the blog since all of this has been happening! Until then!

"event","Well . . . great news! (sarcasm)&nbsp; I cannot put weight on my right leg! Why? Supposedly my ankle is infected.&nbsp; At least, that's what the doctor said, though I find it highly unlikely. First of all, there is nothing breaking the skin; a small abrasion from some carpet burn, but it didn't bleed. It happened over night. late last night I noticed a small, sore lump in my ankle that felt like a knot. I didn't think anything of it and went to bed. This morning, as I was walking to the bathroom, I noticed my foot hurt. A lot. (I had just woken up from a dream, so I was still partially paralyzed and didn't feel it at first) I looked down and my ankle was swollen on the right side. It looked like someone had hit my foot with a hammer; a huge lump the size of my palm ticking our a few inches above the rest of my foot. I soon realized that I had to hop to get around. When Mom got up, I told her, and she got me an appointment at one o'clock today. Really the only thing the doctor accomplished was getting me some crutches. He gave me an antibacterial and a pain killer, told me it's an infection (unlikely) and that if it isn't better in a few days I need to come back. Fun. The really sucky part is that I'm really inspired to choreograph . .. that's not going to happen for a few days. Oh, I never did explain what I think the injury is. I think it's a spider bite. It's red, swollen, blotchy and puffy. I did not injure my foot in any way; in fact, the only strain it had all day yesterday was playing with Dori! I haven't danced in a few days, I haven't hit, twisted, sprained or otherwise injured my foot in any way in recent history. And I do not think it's an infection. There is no break in the skin at all, and the rest of my foot is fine! How could it be infected if there's no break? Bacteria has to have a way in. It can't go through the skin. My skin is perfectly intact, thank you very much. Grumble . . . Anyway, I'm sure it'll be better. It is frustrating, though. Wish me luck!"

But, I've been having some good personal training time. I've been working on my thighs and back. It's paying off :) We've also made more half pound weights, which I discovered are awesome (and comfortable) to put into the pockets of pants. That works out the obliques, thighs, lower back muscles and abs. So hooray. I did some choreographing the other day, but in general I've been a little off. I've been fighting an extremely sore back. I have no idea why it's been like this. I didn't do anything to it. But whatever happened, it hurts like crazy. And to top it off, every morning I've been getting sick. I have to get up early because I have to remedy it (through various means). Right now I'm up a couple hours earlier than I normally would be. So, through all of this, I've been focusing on my book. ^_^ It's coming along quite smoothly now. I'm having fun with it. Oh, and one more thing to rant about, I'm sad that I feel bad today. We were supposed to go up to Waimea Falls again today to take pictures. Bleagh. *waddles off*

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am so sad! Actually, scratch that. I think I'm more frustrated than sad. But in any case, I feel bad. I spent about four or five days last week putting <i>all</i> of our bellydance music onto our hard drive. I encountered enough problems to begin with; there wasn't any more room on our D drive, so we had to go out and buy an external hard drive for Mystik Dream stuff (which was a good idea anyway, and one that we planned to act upon anyway), and then there was this argument between everyone about something that I can't even make sense of . . . really confusing. But in any case, I was already having problems, and I was so relieved when I was ""finished"". All the music had been ripped, it was safe in its own hard drive, I'd cleaned everything up. Everything was ok, right? WRONG! Today I found out that for some strange reason only half of my music was there! I was so pissed! I don't understand it! Not only that, I did a search (in various ways) through the C, D and G drives, and nothing. Absolutely nothing. The same goes for the recycle bin. Nothing. It's gone. And I have to do it again.<br />    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strange thing is that the same thing happened to Mom a few days ago, except that hers was completely gone. All of her music, all of her tweaked songs, all of her made-from-scratch videos, everything. A large chunk of the Mystik Dream website. Gone. From this computer at least. We were lucky enough to be able to recover some of it from the laptop, but all of her videos were still gone. Supposedly it's my fault . . . but I'm not sure. You see, I deleted two empty folders that I'd made, but after that All of Mom's stuff vanished, and she said that she'd seen it in the folder that I deleted. Of course, I felt extremely guilty and irresponsible and downright <i>bad</i>, as it made her very sad and set her back extremely far. But now . . . I'm wondering if something else is going on. But I don't know what.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To top it off, our screen door that we recently bought wasn't primered before it was painting, so the paint is flaking and bubbling, and the door itself is starting to rust. I'm seeing a pattern here. Amber's family is having a lot of bad luck too. I'm wondering if something astrological is going on, or something similar. I shall investigate. Ta ta for now."

While we were there, Mom and I found a nice sunny spot and speculated about various bellydance topics (and took many notes) while Dad snooped around for crashed airplanes. It was a nice pleasant day, and the scenery was beautiful. Dori was a bit scared of the sounds from the gun range, though.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So as we were coming down from the mountain and almost to the foot of the trail, I suddenly gasp and stop in my tracks. ""Look!"" I say in a hushed voice. ""A wild peacock!"" It was about twenty feet down the trail from us; a gorgeous male, ten times more beautiful and healthy looking than any other that I'd ever seen. Dad got his camera, and we stayed with Dori. He walked down, but the peacock went into the bushes. Then it came up the trail towards us, and came out of the bushes behind us, about ten or fifteen feet up. So we have pictures with him! We'll have pictures on the website soon. Dori was great; I was so proud of her. She didn't bark or try to chase it. ^_^

We stopped twice, the first time for about twenty minutes! We still don't know what the holdup was. Be sure to check out the slide show! Go to the website, click on galleries, then Holiday parade, and scroll down! This time Daddy got plenty of pictures (over 300!) and we had a hard time picking the best ones.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've been working quite a bit recently. Website-wise, we're working on new sections, adding links and information, renovating old portions, and more! I've recently been dubbed publicist, and so have been coming up with ways to work our way up in the bellydance community. Basically, I find events to perform in, create listings and advertisements and come up with ideas for expanding our troupe. Woohoo! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're hoping to find a studio that we can use. We need more space without having to worry about being rained on (at the park). Unfortunatly, there aren't many good places here in the Kapolei area. We might be able to work at the High School that's down the hill a bit. Maybe we can use their gym - <i>that</i> would be great! We'd have so much room! Unfortunately, it'd be hard on our knees to do Turkish drops and floorwork. Technically would could use knee pads, but they're annoying. We'll have to keep looking around.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from the parades, we haven't been performing very much. We're training our new troupe members, and I'm working on several choreographies. I imagine that we'll be back in the scene in a month or so! I'm quite excited. We're working now on being booked in the Late Night at the Pyramids,  the next First Friday, St Patrick's Day Parade, and some festival that I can't remember the name of. Keep an eye out!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, for now I shall be off. Ttfn!"

Hopefully the road will be ok at the next parade too, and luckily it won't be downhill. I think that's why the balls of my feet got beat up so bad; my weight was shifted up onto them since we were dancing downhill, which is one of the most challenging things I've done dance-wise! Luckily I got into the rhythm. But yeah, shimmying, going downhill and trying to keep up with the rest of the parade was really hard. >.<
 Next year we may be able to dance on one of the professional floats! That would be awesome. We could have choreography, and wouldn't have to walk and dance at the same time. (or in some cases, jog and dance!) Very professional. We're also looking to do the St. Patrick's Day parade and some festival soon. Fun, fun! As soon as the Yule parade madness is over we need to make troupe pages for Amber and Lenora, and Maybe Summer if she decides to stick with it. Woo!
 Well, I s'pose that's all for now. Ttfn!

 It's interesting to be in Hawaii, and be able to see bullet holes in old buildings, and bomb damage in parking lots. Of course, this only uccurs in old parts of the military bases, especially Pearl Harbor. I've been to the Arizona Memorial, and cried at the incredibly long list of names of those who died just on that ship. A hole wall of names, written in tiny print. It's heart-gripping. Countless memorials are set up all over the island and bases. I've met several people that were involved in the attacks - on both sides. Japanese piolets and American veterans alike. 
 All of this makes it all the more personal. Even though this happened over 60 years ago, the memory still lives, especially in Hawaii."

 The costumes were so great. I've never had a better fitting costume before. Mom actually stiched our costumes on so that we could be sure they would stay put - and they sure did! We should have pictures, because the parade photographer took some, Dad took some when we got home, plus, one of Lenora's friends took some and may even have a bit of video! So one way or another, we're sure to have pics. 
 The shoes were really slippery and made our feet sweaty, so we just took them off! The road was great; I think they must have sweapt it before the parade. At the end though, it got really rough and I felt like I was walking on coals. The other girls were fine, so I know it's just my haole feet kicking in . . . pun intended. They still feel really bad now, though; even the carpet hurts them. Bleagh.
 It was really a ton of fun! I can't wait for the next one. Wooo!
And I'm so happy with myself now - I updated. ;P"

"event","<p class=""MsoNormal"">So! This has been my second day on birth control. I can already tell that it has lessened my problems. With the huge swing of hormones last week, I had many, many residual side effects. Headaches every day, stomach problems, grumpiness, fatigue, insomnia . . . but the past two days everything's been getting better.&nbsp; I mean, it's not perfect, but hormones work fast! My acne's already improving. It was terrible on my period, just terrible. Whether it's better simply because my period's over or if the b/c has something to do with it, I don't know. Either way, I'm extremely happy about it! Even the perpetual redness on the right side of my nose is gone. Woo! My acne had already been doing muuuuch better (with the acceptation of the occasional breakout, like last week) but I really think that being on the birth control for a while will completely take it away. Woo! <br /> &nbsp;So . . . on a darker note, depression is becoming so hard to fight. It's a struggle to stay above water, after swimming for so long. I'm exhausted! This whole Daddy thing . . . Even Mom is loosing hope. She has a sliver of it left, sort of a passive last chance, but things are becoming so bad I constantly feel like he's going to blow it any minute. I don't feel like he cares, and every day seems to be punctuation of that feeling. For instance,<br /> &nbsp;When we went into the ER, Daddy was mad because ""Mom wouldn't listen to what he had to say"" (that they wouldn't be able to help me) and didn't care if it made me feel better emotionally - and&nbsp; it did. I don't think I would have been able to take the pain if I hadn't had the emotional security of doing something about it. I plotted that if it got too bad I'd stand up quickly to try to make myself pass out for a while. Just anything to escape the pain. I swear, I'd never hurt more in my entire life, never screamed so loudly as I did last Sunday.&nbsp; I've been stung by very large jellyfish, I've been bitten by birds with huge beaks, I've hit my head on many things, I've been stung by countless insects, from bees to caterpillars, been raked against coral, been burned (minorly), and so much more . . . but nothing comes anywhere close. That pain was a mile away. Thankfully after it got really bad, endorphins and some other hormones kicked in. After that I was pretty out of it. I basically drugged myself, and it worked well. Heheh, thankfully! <br /> &nbsp;Needless to say, I am positively thrilled - just thrilled to have medicine, after so long. Good bye suffering!</p>"

"event","SO!&nbsp; . . . yesterday sucked big time. I spent all afternoon in the ER, from 1 pmish until around 6pm. Why? Menstrual cramps. They were so bad yesterday, I couldn't handle it. The only way I had to deal with it was to scream with the worst cramps. (usually it was cramp for three seconds, half a second rest, five second cramp, three, three and then two. Then I got thirty seconds to try to catch my breath, and this lasted for three hours) The worst of the whole time was in the car on the way to the ER. By the time we got there I was so hyperventilated that my mouth, face and hands felt like they were asleep, my legs felt like they had tourniquets just below the knees, and I almost passed out after I stood up. I didn't get seen into the emergency room until after the cramps had subsided. Figures. But, they scheduled me an appointment for this morning. That went great. They were going to do a pelvic exam (fun, fun!) but since I'm bleeding they had to wait on that. But they prescribed me birth control pills and prescription strength painkiller. Weee! Hopefully it'll help. We were worried that it was endometriosis, but we all figured that since they begin and cease within the space of ten to twenty minutes, it had to be hormones, which means that the b/c should fix it.
Wish me good luck!"

"event","Well, I had been thinking about it for&nbsp; a while, and I finally did it. Let's rewind a bit. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; In Alabama, the tap water had more choline and other chemicals then our swimming pool did. This, naturally, fried my hair. When we first moved here, I cut my hair from down to my tail bone to about four inches below my shoulder blades. I was sooo sad. And the rest of my hair was still damaged. But, after two years, my hair has grown out about twice that far, and I've been taking good care of it. But I was still unhappy because the hair from my shoulder blades down was still very unhealthy and scraggly looking. Yesterday i had Mom cut off two inches, and then I decided I wanted the rest cut off. So now it comes down to my shoulder blades. I'm happy, though. Even though it's shorter it looks better since it's healthy, and it's much fuller at the bottom. But it feels so weird! I've never had it this short before - unless you count when I was very young and it was still growing! It's so light. But it's fun&nbsp; because it bounces around my shoulders. Although when the wind is blowing it's pretty annoying. Anyway, they say a picture is worth a thousand words, so we'll see if these show up . . . Okay . . . I can't even get them in. Oh well, check out my MySpace. I've got the pics on there . . .<br /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Nefabit/Desktop/hair1.jpg"" /><img alt="""" src=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Nefabit/Desktop/hair3.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Nefabit/Desktop/hair2.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Nefabit/Desktop/hair1.jpg"" /><img alt="""" src=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Nefabit/Desktop/hair1.jpg"" />"

"event","Wow, maybe I'm being a little hard on myself. I've been singing at every opportunity, trying to get back into shape and it's getting kind of hard on the lungs and throat. But I'm so frustrated! I was doing so well before we went to Mississippi. Too bad Mom never heard, either. I told myself I was going to take a break and WOULD NOT SING until I have finished my lemon drop. The only reason I stopped was because my singing started to sound more like croaking. /:{ Grumble. And my throat is actually fine! It's my lungs that's the problem! Surely I haven't overworked them! I just do the standard singing breath and it's never given me problems before. Nrr. I think I may have a dry cough, but maybe that's just from singing. I don't know. But as long as I don't break or stretch anything, I'm going to keep practicing like I am. This is something I want back. Grr.
Anyway, I'm almost done with my lemon drop."

"event","So, I cut my hair today. high time I did too. The ends were still quite frazzled. My hair isn't dry yet, so I can't tell what it will look like, but I think it will be nice. Although, we cut about two inches off and I may have to cut an inch to two inches more. I want all of the frazzled parts gone. It's all because of that chlorine water in Alabama. Mom tested the water from our tap and in our pool - and the tap had more chlorine and various other chemicals than the pool did. It totally ruined my hair. And it's taken two years for half of it to grow out. Maybe in another year I'll have totally new, healthy hair. I wish I could let it get longer, but the chlorine-ridden parts always broke. But the good news is that the new hair hardly ever tangles and is very healthy.
And . . . that's all."

"event","Well, I'm having a bit of difficulty typing due to a mediocre puncture wound to my left index finger, courtesy of Dex. *sigh* I suppose it had to happen sooner or later. :P It was odd to see a hole in my finger. It didn't really bleed but a few drops. (not surprising, being a puncture) Looking at it did make my stomach turn over, though. *laugh* I can look at all kinds of horrid wounds and misfortunes on other people, and all I feel is curiosity and a desire to help. No stomach problems - unless it's my own skin. :P I suppose that's only natural.
 I was intending to write a Nef's Tales from the Air II, but the flight was incredibly uneventful. It didn't seem as long, either, since I had my book. ;) Grandma set a record for longest goodbye in history. >.< She followed us as far as she could, watched us stand in line and then waited at the airport until we called
them from the plane to tell them we got on. *head spins*
So; my flight: Run away from Grandma. Take forever to find United. Get on plane. Read. Get off plane. Eat. Get Tums. Get on plane. Read. Talk. Get off plane. Shop. Get on plane. Talk. Read. Shove a book at Mom so she'll stop talking. Read. Read. Read. Turbulence. Read. Read. Land. Smile. :D
 We were so happy to see Daddy, and it was obvious that he was happy to see us. ^_^ He gave us beautiful leis, that he made himself. ^_^ The car ride home was nice. I was amazed at how much I missed the drive simply because it's familiar. 
 Anyway, I'm off to practice singing. (And my finger needs a rest!)"

"event","WOW. I need to do this. I've been reading about bookbinding and have been considering taking it up as a hobby, and now I'm seriously considering it. And what a way to make money! Some of these things are going for eight hundred dollars. *falls over backwards* And it would be so fun and rewarding . . . I love books, I love crafts, I love handmade things . . . wow. Check out this website!
http://www.brahmsbookworks.com/
I'll construct my grimoire - Sophia, before I attempt to do anything else, and I think that will help me decide if that's something I want to invest in. I've thought about the design and decoration for a few years now, and I've finally found the kind of leather I want, and I've finally decided to start constructing it. I'm going to use the screw post method so I can remove, add and rearrange pages as much as I desire (I do so frequently). I want to do volume one in purple leather, I believe, since the first volume is on the overview or spirituality, and I associate that with purple. I would make it white, except that much white would be too much, I think. Although, I have considered doing some painting along with embossing on the covers, so maybe I could do that. I need to make sure that the design I'm thinking about will allow the book to open flat. I may make it so that it opens like the binder I've got right now, and then put clasps on it so as to keep it from opening or being damaged. I may put a lock on it. But maybe not. Locks just tempt people, and locks can be picked; it also denotes to people that there is something sinister inside . . . and there isn't. :p As for the cover, I've decided on a simple design; in the middle there will be a cat with a fleur de les on its forehead (I've decided on that to be my personal seal, and I want it put on several other things) enclosed in a circle. At the top would be a banner with ""Sophia"", and at the bottom another banner saying ""Volume I"". I haven't thought about the design for volume II, yet. I've come up with all sorts of other decorative ideas, including ribbons and bookmarks, illumination . . . ^_^ I can't wait to get to work on this!!! :D"

"event","Don't let this post deceive you; I still feel crappy. Grandma is going out of her way to make this a big deal. At breakfast she declared that they were all going to talk about this some more. We won't get into that. Anyway, I decided to make a post about something good.
 So I've been reading a lot lately. Imagine that. :P I love reading books about books. I've just started reading a book called Inkheart, and it's really kicked my butt into gear for wanting to get Sophia bound. (For those who don't know Sophia is my book. It is, for lack of better word, my grimoire. Sophia means wisdom.) I'll be thinking about a pattern. I'm only in the third chapter (I wouldn't be unless I wanted to save it for the plane ride home, but hey) and I can tell you it is awesome! I love it. It's one of my favorite books already. ^_^
 I got this book and the next book in the Tamora Pierce series I'm reading at this little home bookstore. At first I walked in and was thinking ""Oh, no, I'm not going to find anything"". I wouldn't have thought that had I been in a town somewhere besides Starkville, Mississippi - small bookstores rock, but in Mississippi most people wouldn't have books on anything interesting for fear of being weird. But I was wrong. There was even a new age section - a tiny, hidden, under deprived, neglected new age section, but it was there. And the lady that ran the place was really nice. We talked quite a bit. She was the one who recommended Inkheart to me. I told her I needed entertainment for about 24 hours of travel. :p This will defiantly help out a lot. ^_^
 Anyway, I intended to write more but I changed my mind. Bye!"

"event","Mawwige! My uncle's getting remarried! And they're getting married in Hawaii! Oh, this is so exciting and it's going to be so hectic. Nine people will be staying in out house somehow . . . this is going to be fun. Well, it will be fun in many ways, but nine people? I don't know how I'm going to stand it. Mom and I are going to help plan the wedding, which will be fun! And I'm assuming that this means I'll actually attend a wedding! I've never been to one before. How exciting! :D
 In other news, I have four days left here. I'm happy and sad, and I tell ya, I'm not looking forward to the flight home. It'll take much longer. Not only are we going against the jet stream, but we have some pretty nasty layovers in Denver and LA. Bleagh. Wish me luck! (And tolerance)"

"event","I was out in the field by the house today playing with the dogs (who have now decided that I'm cool) and all of a sudden I (and the dogs) notice this strange noise. At first it sounds like a plane engine without the rumble, but there was no plane and the sound moved slowly. Then it sounded like strong wind, but the trees were still as could be. The sound was now stationary, though I couldn't pinpoint how far away it was. It sounded like it was right above me, but I couldn't tell. All of a sudden the noise died away and then everything was normal. o_O UFO? No, it would be an UHN; Unidentified Hovering Noise."

"event","Today I got some real treats. First Grandmother got out some old pictures out of Mom when she was a baby and a little girl. She was so pretty. ^_^ I also got to see pictures of my Great grandparents. Best of all I got to see several pictures of Jake! It must have been in the first or second week that he was born because it was during my birthday. It was amazing to see pictures of him. Since he only lived for about three weeks we only have two or three photos of him. In these we have pictures of him with me and him with Mom, so I really found that to be a treasure.
 After that (and my skimpy breakfast) we got Mom's wedding dress out for me to see! I mean, I have seen pictures plenty of times. We have a whole album for their wedding day. But being able to see it up close was amazing. I love it and I can't wait to wear it one day. It's so beautiful. The bodice is perfect, with a scalloped V-neck and beautiful stitchery and pearlescent beads and sequins. The train is the perfect length; it's long enough to be a train without being ridiculous. And the veil that Grandmother made is gorgeous. The only thing I would want altered is the sleeves. Mom couldn't find a dress without puffy sleeves because of the styles during the time she got married, but luckily I can have them altered. Of course I haven't decided how I'd want it done, but I'm thinking about having made into a sleeveless, so long as I get married during a warm part of the year. :P
 I've been told that it's unnecessary or silly to think about my future wedding day, but what girl doesn't? It's the day when every girl gets to be a princess; it's among the most exciting and important days of our lives. It's many a girl's favorite thing to daydream about. And I'm one of them! I want to get married under the wedding tree at my Great Grandfather's house which is now Eden State Gardens. ^_^
 Anyway, I'm going to go take a bath here . . ."

&nbsp;So, last night of course we had another religious war with you-know-who. After that, I wasn't sleepy so I read, did some puzzles and then listened to music. (once again I love my IPod) Then all a sudden I decide to flop over because my nightshirt was pulling on my throat and then - BANG - At first I didn't know what it was until my elbow started throbbing. Ow. It didn't stop hurting for a few minutes. It was painful. Mom was able to heal it some and stop it hurting faster then I think it would. After that I got sleepyish. BUT, this morning I slept quite late because I was soooo drained. When Mom told me if&nbsp; I didn't get up I wouldn't sleep tonight I was so tiered that I could barely talk or roll over. I'm okayish now, but I'm still really drained. I have .000.1 energy. *flops over* I need to go eat now . . ."

"event","Hi everyone!
 So, we somehow ended up getting to the tryouts late. But, we only missed stretching and a bit of choreography. So we got there and jumped right in. About a third of the people stayed for the tryouts, but almost everyone stayed to watch for a while. Sonia taught us a short burst of choreography that we only went over a few times . . . It was difficult because I didn't understand some of the terms, particularly the jazz ones. I totally flopped when we had to perform it. But as for my solo, that was great. It felt great, and Sonia seemed to like it. (What a compliment that would be!) Mom made a short version of Navras for me to do, and it was awesome! It all went surprisingly fast. I had so much fun! Sonia said I would have to wait three years to join the troupe, but it would have been stupid of me not to go since the opportunity is practically knocking on my doorstep!
 Mom is really working on the website. She hasn't decided on a templet yet, but she is going to get one of the high quality, customizable templates. She's also working on a few surprises! Woohoo! I can't wait for her to ""finish"" it! ^_^

"event","Well, lots and LOTS (tons, really) has been going on lately - and almost none of it has anything whatsoever to do with dance. I'm begining to be a bit more limber in every day life, and we're practicing for the MSNG, and other than that - nothin. Oh . . . escept I know there's a MEADAH recital soon . . . I'll have to check the planner. So anyway, apat from begining to understand the creation and very fabric of the universe and reaching enlightement on some levels, reaching a new conclusion and opinion about love and life and having wished the world to end . . . yeah, noting much. (Luckily, the state of mind that includes wishing the world to end - in various ways - has passed . . . for the moment.)
 Oh, went to see POTC II And I must say - BEST MOVIE EVER. I can't wait until the next one!
And until we meet again . . .

I hope our costumes get here in time, though. I can't remember if I wrote about this in my last post so perhaphs I'll repeat myself. Anyway, we ordered HUUUGE ""Ultra Gypsy Skirts"" from We Three Bellydance. I think Mom got the matching tops too. Yay!
 We missed the muscular distrophy funraiser because we forgot to ask Daddy to take us and then he went on a hike before we rememberd. Grr. But I'll be doing the number I meant to do then at the Gleam. Yay!"

 First off, I'll be performing at a muscular dystrophy fundraising event. Check the website for details, because I don't know. (Hey, I don't have to drive!) Hopefully I can get both Griff and Dad to go so we'll have pictures AND video. ^_^ Or I might be able to snag some pictures from Bob. He'll probably be there. I'll be dancing to the song Nataraja from the Satya CD by Solace. I have no idea what I am going to wear, but I think I'll wear the gold/black ensemble I wore to last year's MEADA performance.
 And after that on July . . . 15th, I believe is the Midsummer Night's Gleam! Wee! Mom and I want to do a fun Gypsy dagger dance. We're still working on it. And we will be wearing our BRAND NEW ultimate gypsy skirts by We Three!!! :D (With matching tops) Yippee!
 So anyway, hope to see people there!

"event","Well, sorry it's been so long! Oops. *whistles* Lots has been going on - dance related and non - and I havn't had time to update . . . and I forget too. :p So anyway, the Midsummer's Night Gleam is coming up and Mom and I are hoping to do something a bit more medieval or Pagan than we did last year. I'm probbly going to do an Irish fusion, but Mom isn't sure what she's going to do. I'll keep my costume simple again. A black skirt iwth white fleur de lis that has a pretty ruffle will be tucked up over and under a silver hip scarf artfully, and I'll wear a black choli over a simple silver coin bra. I think.
 I hope we'll see the Golden Horde there. I havn't seen them in a long time . . . actualy maybe we'll go tomorrow. I stopped going because no one has been going and it'd been quite dull. But Wolf has been telling us that lots of people have been coming regularly, so I want to check it out. 
I NEED MUSIC. I've found all kinds of folky-Pagan shtuff, but I want more tribal and good caberet stuff. I've beeb partially workign on choreography, but most of it is for the big show we'll do once we're back in WA. 
 But most importantly is the upcoming Bellydance Superstars tryouts. I can't decide if I'd want to be selected, though. We're trying out definitly, but I just don't know. It's sort of a bad time, but we would be stupid to pass this opportunity up. There are pros and cons. First and foremost I'd be able to dance for a living, which has been a major dream of mine. I wouldn't want to do it for much more than a year though. I have other thigns I need to do too, including college. I'd be able to travel - hopefuly to Europe, which I have *allways* wanted to do. I wouldn't be able to see it as well as I'd like but ah well. I'd have plenty of time to work on my book during travel, but I wouldn't have much rest time. I can't sleep in transit or during the day. I just can't. Maybe I can adapt, but we'll see. Another thing is that I'd be away from my Dad and my friends. But I can come and visit, so that'd be good. Er. I just don't know. Our plan is that we'll play it by ear. Sonia is coming in July someplace downtown and she'll do a workshop and the tryouts. Selected dancers will go to LA, I think it is, to do another tryout with Jillina and Myles. And if you're selected, no telling where ya'd end up. :P So yeah. We'll see."

"event","HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII! I'm back! I finally got back in! Eek! I've tried to log in so many times. It's been frustrating. Sometimes it lets me in, sometimes not. Anyway, I have tons to talk about dance-wise!
Hmm, for starters, I'm working on getting some NEW pictures on my ""About me page"", so wish me luck with that.
More importantly, I've been a bit mroe active. Did a birthday party, went to the Medah Halfla, which was awesome. We've done photo shoots, and increased our daily training.
medah was a lot of fun. It wasn't a very big room, but there was a lot of vending. Mostly medah members. I don't think anyone else came. I can't wait to till the next show. But, the medah members got a real treat. We finally got coordinated in Ma Haddesh Ye Lomni and Boro Boro. You can see the videos of the performances at da website. ^_^ (mystikdream.com) We were so tempted to buy stuff. There was the Lavish Layers video by Ansuya, beautiful sequinne buttrfly halter tops, and all kinds of pretty shineys!
Oooh! it's April Fools day just now! Hmm . . . I'm not really a human. I'm a cat in disguise! Oh, wait we knew that. . .
We've really been pulling ourselves together, Mom and I have. We're working on getting some really nice costumes, we've ordered fire fans and ISIS WINGS! Yes, Isis wings. ^_^ We're looking at some very, very nice costumes, but they're WIRED! >.< Grrr.
So, I've picked up the double veils - Petite Jamilla style. it's loads of fun once your arms get used to it! I love twirling. I think I'll do a double veil routine at the next MEDAH. I've come up with some nice moves I want to try out. ^_^
Anyway, Don't have much else to say at the moment. Yes, after all that time not much else has happened dance wise. *sigh* But trust me. Things are going to pick up real fast! ;)"

On the 19th Mom and I will be performing somewhere in Kaneohe. Check out the Yahoo group bellydance hawaii for details. I""m so excited! Mom and I will be doing Boro Boro and Ma Haddesh Ye Lomni! Weee! *be bops around*
This morning Mom and I went down the hill to Pizza Hut to meet someone, and on the way home Mom and I caught the 411 as usual. We said we didn't need transfers, but the guy gave us to them anyway without saying a word. We didn't know why and thought it was unusual. Turns out that at the transit station he changed to the 412 rout!!!! So we had to get off and walk. I was so mad at him for not telling us that he would be changing routs! I mean, how am I supposed to know just by him shoving transfers in our face??? Grrrrr.
Luckily, our friend and bellydance student Lenora was driving by at the time and gave us a ride up the hill! I was so happy and relieved! :D What synchronicity!! Weeee! I happy now. I still want to find out who it was that did that. I want to report his behaviour.  >:/
Mom and I finally got the thousand dollars worth of silks this week - that was supposed to be delivered in time for the YULE PARADE! Though excruciatingly late, they are very high quality. We'll be using two sets in our upcoming performance. ^_^
Speaking of the Yule parade, I have been working extensively on he choreography for the Yule performance which we will *hopefully* be doing this year. I don't think we're going to have enough people, though. :.( No one on the island is dedicated enough to go thought he training and choreography to do this. *sigh* No one's willing to work hard enough.
For the choreography I've come up with I need at least 8 girls and 8 guys. If you've read the website you will know that strength and flexibility are required, and that men will NOT be doing fluffy girly moves. If anyone is interested, contact me.
Well, that's all for now! Not much has been gong on in the bellydance area of life lately.
I have been pumping out artwork like crazy, though! Check out my deviantART page at http://nefabit.deviantart.com/
Ttyl!

"event","Wow! Sorry I haven't updated yet! I've been busy! New Year's Eve was awesome. We started the day getting ready for the party. Cleaning, cooking, etc. Griff made awesome kabobs. Then Dad and I left early to pick Malka up so he could stop at the Hobby shop. So I waited in the car while he was in there. Then we headed out to Kakaako. But Daddy went to the wrong place! He went to th one that we used to pick um Mirage at! So then we had to go up to punchbowl form there, across and down Ward to get to Kakaako! When we were almost there, we were stuck at a long red light when we noticed this drunk or stoned guy staggering around on the side of the road. We were shaking out heads at him and then he walked out into the road! All the cars in that lane had to stop. One stopped only a few feet from him! And he just waved lazily at the car as if he were shooing a fly away!!! But then he started going across the other side of the road strait into oncoming traffic! And there were cars and a bus coming! Dad and I saw the bus coming and it looked like he was going to hit the guy! So Dad and I covered our eyes. I did not want to see someone's brains get thrown out of their heads by a bus . . . The bus just barely missed him and he miraculously made it across the road. He didn't even know that the bus was there. I was shocked and shaking. I almost witnessed someone die horribly! Daddy called the police and told them about the guy so that hopefully they would get him off the street. I don't know if they found him or not. So, still shaking, we made our way to the park to wait for Malka. I was still shaking when she got there. I was so happy to see her, though! We squealed and jumped up and ran to greet each other, and then squeezed each other to death! Okay, maybe not to death, but . . . Oh, and then we had so much fun! On the way to the house she told us about college and her friends and we caught up. When we got to the house, Mom and Malka greeted and the party started. We ate kabobs and watched Bedazzled, then went outside to swing glow poi and dance in the street. We chittered and chattered ad danced and had fun. Then we went inside and got decked out in costumes and makeup and danced some more, took pictures and video, watched bellydance videos and laughed and giggled some more! Then it was about 10 till 12 and we went down the street to watch the fireworks downtown. There were fireworks everywhere! It was cool. Then we went inside and danced a bit more, than watched Magnetic Storm. Then we all fell asleep. So we woke each other up and got ready for bed. Malka's sister came to pick her up around ten that morning and we hung out for a while, then they left. So I spent the morning on line, hanging out on Tribe until we decided to got to the NEX for lunch.  On the way there we had this big fight, and we got so upset, but we got it under control and laughed about it later because we realized that it was about nothing. We always get like that when we're hungry. So we ate and felt better. We ended up having a really good time! We agreed that we would avoid the situation in the future. That if it happened again if one of us said ""Hungry alert!"" all of us would have to stop talking until we got food in our bellies. Then we would talk about what was wrong. So yay!
As for today, I have spent it updating on Tribe (one of my new favorite hobbies!) and watching the Stargate marathon. Wee! I love lazy days!"

"event","Oh. My. Goddess. *head spins* Yesterday just came over me like a Bugs Bunny cartoon; it spun around me and left me spinning.
We had a photo shoot to go to, but not really any good costumes. We technically had matching caberet costumes, but not practically. We have two black ones and two green, but I er, outgrew mine, so in order to wear one I have to get Mom's bra and my belt. So, in effect we have one of each. Not to mention caberet costumes don't really go along with the tribal atmosphere of Fire Tribe/Spin Jam. But we didn't have tribal costumes that matched well enough. So I suggested to Mom that we run to Wall Mart and get supplies to finish them up. We had matching bras and skirts, and simple cowrie shell belts. But they weren't really extravagant enough. We wanted to get really good pictures for the website. So we went to Wall Mart and got silk flowers for our hair, this cool sting stuff to make a belt and yarn for tassels. (We had cowrie shell belts to go on top of those) We went home and got to work. I made the string belts while Mom made the tassels. Then we painted our nails and made them some more. We were running out of time by now and we still had to pin the coin/beaded bra covers tot he bras. So while Mom worked more on tassels (which take a while) I pinned my bra. That took some fighting. Then worked some more. Mom got her skirt and we realized it had been sitting in this basket that smells like resin, so we had to put it in the dryer with some baking soda (or something. i can't remember what she put in there with it). I finally had our string belts done, and so I did my make up. I lined my eyes with black and then used red lip liner over my lids, and a glitter stick over that. Then my Burt's Bees lip color. Mom still didn't have her bra pinned, so we had to make do with the tassels we had. So I started pinning her bra for her because she couldn't see that well. Then she noticed that my bra was pinned backwards. The coins and beads were facing the wrong way. So I had to un-pin and re-pin mine while she did hers. At this point we were supposed to be on our way, so in our haste we where only slowing ourselves down. Fighting with my bra, I became twice as agitated as I was before and I warned Mom and Griff that if anyone touched me from behind I was likely to bite someone. Then there was this one safety pin in particular that was not working with me. I ended up screaming a bit and had to get Mom to pin it. . . Or was that Griff? I don't remember. Geez! As you can imagine I was hysterical at this point. Finally I got it pinned. Figures. That done, I did Mom's makeup. Then we realized we still had to clip the chains off our bras, get water, music and speakers. So Mom got the music fixings while Griff clipped the chains for me. Then when he clipped hers I got water and crackers. Then we zoomed around the house to get everything else we needed and we where out the door - finally. Once in the car I was able to relax a little. But the fact was that we where an hour late. And we still had to get there. (Griff ended up er, speeding to get us there . . .) In the car I was pretty goofy for about ten minutes. I was so stressed that eating my crackers gave me a stomach ache. So I decided not to eat. We finally got there, and everyone (except for Harry and Linda and their crew) was happy to see us. :3 Yay! The drummers were all happy to tell us that they practiced our drumbeats and wanted to show us, so we danced for them a bit while we were waiting for Debbie to show up. I think every time I dance I love it more! I had so much fun. Then Debbie got there and we went to take pictures. That was awesome. She has this wonderful camera, so the pictures we got where really professional looking! Mom and I had fun thinking up poses and I can't wait to see the pictures! I'll have to see if she posted them on Tribe yet . . . When I got home I just crashed. I barely had energy to get my futon and blanket out. I got the futon out, after much wrestling with my closet, my cloths, the futon and my cloths hamper, and just crashed. Much to my dismay, I still had to get undressed and get my blanket spread out. Mah. Don't remember anything after that. As for today, I can sum it all up in one word: Choreography. :P Well, aside from some rather interesting research . . . In any case, I'd better go. I need to work on my calender. The year is almost over! I can't wait 'till Imbolc! Cheers everyone! -S"

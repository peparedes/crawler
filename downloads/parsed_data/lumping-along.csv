"event","Going to tell Ana ""no"" for sure tomorrow.

Here's (roughly, and in a more eloquent form) what I'm planning to say.

""I've thought a lot about what we talked about last week, and it's honestly something that's been on my mind for over a month now.  I thought particularly about what you said about not basing my decision on a quarter's worth of planning-based stress, and I want to assure you that I have considered my whole experience at Rowe when thinking about what I want to do next year.

""I'm going to be forthright and tell you that my experience here has been a hard one.  It's taken a lot out of me to develop the way you've noticed me developing as a teacher and as a professional person, and I'm really not sure I can sustain this kind of work.  Your advice about becoming a professional in a career has been valuable and thought-provoking for me, and it's led me to think about what I <i>can</i> sustain as a career.

""Because I love teaching so much--I love seeing kids grow, I love seeing the light bulbs go off in their heads, and I love talking to kids about what they've learned--I am definitely going to be looking for opportunities within education for the future, something I know you know far more about than I do.  I remember you saying that you helped Brian think about possibilities for his future, and Katie Kleczek was certainly grateful to you for the help you gave her this past summer.  I'm hoping that, in my search for a new challenge, I can bounce ideas off of you and have you there as that cheerleader figure you have said you want to be.  I am certainly planning on being a cheerleader for the academics at Rowe and working hard to ensure that they're the best they can be.  So I hope I can count on your support throughout the next several months.""

AHHH."

"event","Teehee.  I like ""The Call.""  Oh, those Backstreet Boys.

Anydangways.  I'm trying to journal more and record my thoughts on teaching and Rowe more consistently, rather than when I'm just feeling discouraged or elated.  John suggested that, in order to help me make a decision about where I'll work next year, I keep a running list of pros and cons about Rowe.  Or just make more consistent writings about my feelings about the place.

So, let's see.  This week has been odd.  Monday we started new groups after our SEL instruction at 12:40, and I'm doing explicit sight word instruction.  That has been improving over the course of the week; the first day, I stood up there teaching for too long and didn't execute the lesson the way it was supposed to be executed.  However, I think that my kids are getting the hang of it--today, Edgar (who can't really talk at all) read the sentence ""The dog is big.""  The only clue he had was a picture of a dog under the word ""dog,"" since he can't read that word yet.  Then Mason read ""I am a big bird"" and I was SO EXCITED.  They are starting to read!!!

That is one of the biggest pros of my job: the staff is capable and I am working with Anjali, an incredibly talented teacher who makes magical things happen in her scholars' brains.  I am merely riding the wave of that magic, I think, and I want to learn how to create it myself.  I'm growing as a professional and as a teacher, but I want to reach better heights.

All that being said, there are some serious things that irk me about my school.  One of those things is the leadership team.  Three out of five of them are being jackasses this year and just don't do what they need to do to contribute to the overall well-being of our school.  It's sometimes infuriating.  The decisions they make often have no basis in reality or they expect us to perform trivial tasks like it's the most important thing in our days.  I'm sorry, but no.  There are 25 children in my classroom and THEY are the most important things in my day.

However, I also feel SUCH a sense of accomplishment when I see my kids writing down letters because they now know the alphabet, to see the difference in their Summer Orientation data and their data not three months later, and to hear them READING FULL SENTENCES!!!!  It's amazing.  Another fantastic thing is seeing how much the smile when there is something interactive to do during one of our lessons.  I love kindergarten and kind of want to teach this grade forever.  Hopefully Ana will be able to find me a spot in K next year, if I stay.

One thing that scares me, though, is the workload and the pressure to achieve certain data benchmarks.  I don't doubt that I can do it; what makes me nervous is the amount of time and energy I know I will have to devote to my job if I accept a classroom lead teacher position for next year--which I know Ana is eager to give me.  There are moments like today, when I see the hard work I've put in paying off in scholars' learning.  However, there are also selfish moments (like that post I wrote last week) when I wish I had an 8-5 job in a clean environment and in which I didn't have to put in lots of extra work outside of the office.  Part of me knows I'd be bored stiff by that kind of work, though, so I end up in this awkward place where I don't really know where I'll be next year.

Anyway, one odd thing about this week was that yesterday, two out of three of the third/fourth grade teachers (they are departmentalized, so the classes switch for different subjects) were absent.  That meant that the administration hired ONE sub and then pulled THREE different co-teachers from their classrooms for a third of the day to teach third/fourth grade.  It was super-stressful.  While I don't mind pitching in for people when they're sick (lord knows people did that for me when I missed a whole week last year with the Peruvian death flu), I DO mind our administration not having a sound, sustainable process for securing adequate coverage for absent teachers without taking learning opportunities from the kids in the classes from which they pull teachers.  GRRRR.

Sigh.  I always end up with highly mixed feelings when I think about my job.  It's hard to know what to do . . ."

"event","Definitely listening to ""I Gotta Feeling"" by the Black Eyed Peas after talking to two of my 7th grade girls from Breakthrough last year--they're now 8th graders and, as I predicted, are pretty jaded on Breakthrough (it's just a thing that happens after kids have been through a year of middle school).  It's hard to convince them that things will be okay from like 3000 miles away, especially when I'm obviously absent and don't know exactly what's going on.  At least they said they miss me?  I certainly miss them, Breakthrough and its culture, and Santa Fe.  A lot.  Like, some days it's overwhelming how much I wish I was in the mountains at the IHM, doing cheers and writing songs.

At the same time, I'm becoming increasingly attached to my students from this summer.  I don't think I'll ever forget Jasean bugging me every day for his leadership tickets, Cornelius's look of surprise when I praised him for doing a great job in math, Delisa's desire to measure angles with a protractor correctly, the utter transformation that I've seen in Zhane's behavior since Day 1, and Hakeem's desire to show me his 7th grade-level work.  I could go on and on, but I really need to get back to planning my lessons for next week.

So the point is . . . even on nights like tonight when I'm sick and writing another lesson plan seems like it might ACTUALLY kill me, I remember Melissa and her laugh, Ivanna and her quiet sass, and my students from every summer I've taught . . . and it's all okay.

"event","Tonight is the eve of week 3 of Institute.  That means it's the second week of teaching.  Even though it's only a three day week (due to the holiday tomorrow and us not having school on Fridays), I am not feeling less pressure to improve my teaching.  If anything, fewer days means fewer tries to get it right.  So I'm trying to get my mental focus back on my students.

Last week was really difficult.  I wouldn't say it was the most difficult week of my life, as many TFA people have expressed.  It was certainly one of my more sleep-deprived weeks, but it wasn't the hardest.  I was frustrated, excited, disappointed, flat-out angry, happy, and exhausted last week.  It was a whirlwind that left me spinning, but with the solid conclusion that I really need to step up my time-management and execution.  And that's what I am trying to focus on this week.

Tomorrow is supposed to be a holiday, but we purportedly have a whole day of ""sessions""--blocks of time led by veteran teachers who did TFA at the beginning of their teaching careers.  Sessions are supposed to teach us the skills we need to be effective teachers in all facets of the job, but really what they are for me is a giant frustration.  I want concrete strategies that help me deal with the issues I <i>know</i> I have.  I completely acknowledge that TFA is trying to simultaneously equip us with the skills we'll need to do well this summer <i>in addition to</i> skills we'll need back in our regions (for me, Chicago), but it's really hard to know exactly what behavior management thing I need to focus on as a next logical step and then spend 3 hours in some session about lesson planning.  Bleh.  

That's not to say that I don't have a deep respect and admiration for the veteran teachers who lead those sessions.  They have a wealth of knowledge that they clearly found through years of hard work.  I would just like to have more personalized interactions with them.  And it's really a possibility--all I have to do is email or call them.  In the coming weeks, I'm going to make a concerted effort to reach out to them when I need individual advice instead of just whining about how sessions are a waste of time or whatever.  Indeed.

Oh well.  Looking on the brighter side of things, I'm determined to get 7 hours of sleep every night this week.  I worked a lot this weekend to help put my planning ahead by a few days, and I'm really hoping it will help.

Anyway.  It's shower time, then a little lesson-planning, then bed."

<b>Wednesday, May 19 2010, 11:29am:</b> Back to work after a weird night's sleep.  I had a bizarre dream in which my mom and David and I were in a store that sold earrings made of pretty stones, and that my mom was thinking about buying some for herself (this is only weird because she doesn't actually have her ears pierced).  Then while I was wandering around the store, some of those ladies from Granada who were holding small sprigs of plants and offering to tell me my fortune started swarming around me in the store and I had to push them away every time they got close.  It was bizarre.  Anyway.  Now I'm just procrastinating.  Gah.  LotR:TTT soundtrack today.

Yesterday in fit of procrastination registered on a realty website (don't worry, John, it is reputable--TFA recommends it--also it is free), and just now received call from friendly woman asking me all sorts of questions about where I want to live and when I want to move in and do I want parking.  It was all very awkward and she was going to transfer me to a guy who ""knows Bucktown really well"" but then I was like, ""Ummmm, I'm actually working on my last paper ever of undergrad, would it be okay if I just gave him a call some other time?""  And now I feel weird about growing up and moving on.  Is too weird to be dealing with realty agents and such.  I am not ready.  I mean, I ate 3 packages of fruit snacks and a plateful of hash browns for breakfast/lunch today.  I am clearly not on the cusp of adulthood.  AHHHHH.

- Last night someone decided it would be a good idea to write some violently anti-queer things in the dorms--one comment was written on a poster, another was <i>carved into a fucking door</i>.  I'm so tired of this school being filled up with hate and I'm so tired of seeing people I care about feel threatened because they chose to attend this institution of higher education or whatever it is.
- I have terrible cramps.
- I actually cannot decide what to do about nationals, and as a result I'm feeling crappier than ever about a friendship that I once considered my best at this school.
- I have to write a philosophy paper.
- A guy from the men's frisbee team who is also on track got seriously injured at a meet in IL this weekend.  He is apparently in critical condition.

Clearly only the first, third, and last ones are really wearing on me emotionally.  I mean, yeah the philosophy paper sucks, but whatever.  I can handle it.  What I <i>can't</i> handle is being in this environment, living with a roommate with whom I am currently what I can only describe as ""furious.""  It's also really difficult to know someone and then hear that they are in the hospital--not that I know him very well personally, but we knew each other from frisbee . . . and it just sucks to hear that a good person got hurt.

I've thought about going to nationals as a way to escape said ""friend"" and the terrible, terrible environment that some assholes have decided is their right to create on this campus.  Part of me thinks that that's not a constructive way of dealing with either of the situations.  Part of me really wants to stay here for commencement weekend to see the people who have been good to me and to make sure we can make some good memories before we all disperse all over the world.  Part of me wants to punch a certain someone in the face, but I will refrain in favor of a serious conversation about how I've felt bad about myself all year because he decided to ditch all of his former friends in favor of some new people just because they happen to live with his girlfriend.  I'm tired of feeling abandoned, uncomfortable, and like I can't confide in anyone here.  I'm tired of it.  I'm so fucking tired of this place that I really do want to go to nationals in a way.  I don't know what to do.

NATIONALS PRO AND CON LIST
PROS:
- Get to play frisbee
- Get to hang out with frisbee friends
- Don't have to worry about the awkwardness of hanging around in Grinnell and meeting people's families and trying to avoid a certain someone
- Don't have to explain awkwardly to captain-friend that I am not going to nationals as promised and why
- Don't have to be around the friends of friends I don't really care for at all; also, don't have to be around that one ""friend""

CONS:
- Miss seeing people who have been important to me for 4 years
- Miss out on some ""important"" ceremonies or whatever
- Don't get back until late Sunday night
- Don't get to see alum friends who are coming back for the weekend very much at all
- Have to leave Block Party early
- Don't get to relax and try to enjoy the very end of my time in Grinnell
- Less time to pack and organize all my shit

From the looks of those lists in terms of numbers alone, it seems like I am more inclined to stay.  However, I really don't want to feel like I'm letting the team down . . . although I haven't been to practice/anything they've done as a team in like 2 weeks.  So I don't know.  Also I don't always feel super-included by them.  Also I will just be uncomfortable anywhere I go, so what does it matter in the end.

Here are some awards I would like to give to these books:

The <b><u>Most Terrifying Book Award</u></b> goes to . . . <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>!
The <b><u>Best New Book I've Read All Year Award</u></b> goes to . . . <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>!
The <b><u>Most Tedious Thing I've Read All Year Award</u></b> goes to . . . <i>In Memoriam</i>!
The <b><u>Weirdest Book I've Read All Year</u></b> goes to . . . <i>The Castle of Otranto</i>!

Perhaps I will think of more awards once I've read more books.  But perhaps not."

- Tired
- Nauseous
- Sad
- Angry
- Apathetic
- Proud

Today I have done the following things instead of reading in preparation for my philosophy paper:
- Napped
- Played bubble shooter
- Made a sandwich

The following are all that stand between me and being completely done with the academic part of my last year of college:
- 1 English class
- 1 Philosophy paper
- 1 English paper"

"event","This morning I woke up to a weird sound.  It was kind of like a clicking noise and for some reason I thought the magnetic plug for my computer was detaching and then re-attaching itself to Logan Jr.  But when I got up to inspect, the sound was coming from the area near my bookshelf.  Perplexed, I went back to bed but couldn't fall asleep again because of the continual noise.

Eventually I figured out by looking at the area near my bookshelf that it was, in fact, water dripping onto a big pile of plastic shopping bags that I've been keeping for no real reason.  So, great, my ceiling was leaking (did I mention it was storming when I woke up?  Because it was).  At first I was a little bit upset about it, but at some point while I was getting dressed I just decided not to be upset by it.  That expression about not crying over spilled milk came to mind.  Whatever.  It's just another reason to be all the more excited about getting a new apartment in a new city and starting a new job with new people.  And I mean, yeah I still have some weird social anxiety about starting all over, but I do know several people who are going to be in Chicago next year, and I'll have John and all.  So I'm not too worried anymore.  I'm mostly just excited to get out of Grinnell."

Suffice it to say that I'm not really sad about it being almost over.

<b>EDIT (11:35pm):</b> Another thing about which I am not sad: being almost done with this bullshit American lit class.  My throat is very sore and dry from reciting Emily Dickinson poems out loud to myself in preparation for tomorrow's ""poetry recitation.""

"event","I think I can say with some certainty, now, that my inability to focus this week has been related in some way to my TMJ problems.  Here are some of the symptoms I've experienced:

- Jaw pain
- Jaw stiffness
- Trouble opening jaw all the way
- Jaw cracking when opening mouth
- Aching pain even when not opening my mouth
- Bad headaches
- Nausea
- Dizziness
- Ear pressure
- Ears itching
- Ears feeling ""full"" (gross, I know)
- Trouble sleeping at night

I would say that a large part of my inability to focus has to do with these ailments.  Because, you know, it's not like I haven't been <i>trying</i> to get my work done.  It's just really, really difficult right now.

Fortunately I went to the health center and doctor today.  I was a little bit worried because I was seeing a nurse practitioner who has historically made light of many students' ailments.  But she was actually fairly helpful and prescribed me some scary muscle relaxers that I'm only supposed to take at night because they will make me very, very sleepy.  Kind of like my allergy medicine, I guess.

Anyway, the point of this is that I feel awful like 95% of the time, I'm struggling to get my homework done, and I'm not doing anything superfluous right now.  That means I'm just spending my time trying to feel better and trying to get my work done so I can fucking graduate in less than three weeks (!!!)."

6-7: Research for 228 paper
7-8: Quintet rehearsal (?)
8-bedtime: WRITE 228 PAPER

The end!

EDIT: OMG that dinner was so full of awkward.  Holy crap.  I hate snooty academic things.  Also I really don't want to go to quintet rehearsal.  I am tired of it and I don't really even want to play in our concert.  :(

EDIT 2 (6:40pm): Oh god.  I just chugged a giant glass of chocolate soy milk immediately after eating string cheese and wheat thins.  So delicious, but so eaten-too-quickly.  Urgh.  Now I REALLY REALLY don't want to go to rehearsal.  I mean, really.  Why should I, other than that I committed to this at the beginning of the semester?  People quit things all the time.  Like jobs.  And clubs and stuff.  Although I really can't back out.  I wish I could, though, because our flute player is nearly always out of tune and only has like two dynamic levels: ""piercingly loud"" and ""slightly less obnoxious than piercingly loud.""  It is going to be kind of embarrassing to play at our upcoming concert.  Oh well.  At least DIII nationals will probably save me from the humiliation of performing at Senior Showcase.

Also, thanks to all the frisbee I have been playing lately, my calf muscles have gotten rather large.  It's kind of weird to accidentally touch one (I know it sounds weird, but whatever) and think, ""OH GOD WHAT IS THAT MUTANT THING"" and then realize it is my very own calf.

EDIT 3 (6:51pm): LIST OF THINGS I DO NOT WANT RIGHT NOW:
1. To play my clarinet.
2. Gas.
3. Homework.

EDIT 4 (6:52pm): Have I mentioned that I've been having dreams in Spanish a lot lately?  It's weird and disorienting, but pretty cool nonetheless.  Anyway.  I guess I'll go trudge off to the music building now.

EDIT 5 (8:25pm): Ugh.  I am so unenthusiastic about the following things:
1. Quintet - barf.
2. This paper.  Ugh.

Things I miss (in no particular order):
1. Barcelona.
2. Kae Dog
3. My brother
4. John
5. Santa Fe - particularly green chile smothered all over everything.  Mmmm.

SIGH.

EDIT 6 (9:15pm): This is becoming a live-blog of my day.  Or a weirdly disjointed SOC.  ANYWAY.  The coffee I bought at the Grille earlier to fuel my paper-writing madness is <i>actually</i> the grossest sludge I have ever purchased from them.  With the exception of that one cup I bought in Fall '08 which tasted like dead things from the flavor shot + suger + creamer that I put in it.  Gross.  (1.15 pages!)"

Anyway, I had a point to make . . . I forget what it was.  OH.  Right.  

I'm listening to Relient K (Two Lefts...) right now, and it's making me feel like I should be outside running on some insanely humid day.  That plus playing lots of frisbee lately has made me feel like I really need to commit to exercising once Institute/TFA starts, because otherwise I will just feel and look like a slob, and no one wants that.  I am a lot more content with life when I make time to work out, so I need to remember that when things start to get super-busy and I don't have frisbee practice to force me out of my serious slothdom.

That's it.  That's all I wanted to write about.  Nothing good here, sorry.  Just lots of thoughts about the future, frisbee (it's v. likely that we'll go to DIII nationals!), and some philosophy.  Wooo."

"event","So far today, during my 2-hour break between classes, all I have accomplished is:

- Making coffee
- Heating up some lunch
- Converting songs from .ogg and .wma (I know, I know) files to .mp3 so that I can actually listen to them in iTunes.  This is the first inconvenience related to Logan Jr., but it's really not that bad.  I mean, this free software actually converts them quite quickly and at a high quality.  SO THERE.

I figure that all three of these things (particularly the music organizing thing) will help me sustain the extended periods of time I'll be spending writing papers and whatnot in the coming weeks, so it's not like I'm wasting my time.  Otherwise I'd be procrastinating for the next two weeks on music-file-conversion.  So.  Actually I'm being quite productive.

Logan Sr. is still on my desk, doing all the things I usually ask of him--playing music, opening up Hyperbole and a Half so I can read that instead of my philosophy homework, etc.  Despite my recent frustrations with his inability to type things, his DVD drive's penchant for opening for no apparent reason, and his inability to open important files sometimes, I do have a soft spot in my heart for him.  He was my first computer, after all.  He went to Santa Fe and Europe with me, for crying out loud.  Logan Jr. has a lot to live up to.

Now the question becomes: what do I do with Logan Sr. while I use Logan Jr. for the remainder of the year??  I mean, naturally I'm going to write all of my final papers on this bad boy.  But Logan Sr. will just look so sad, all shut down forever in a corner or something.  Oh, what to do.  I find myself getting a little bit teary, just contemplating never using Logan Sr. again.  Maybe I can find some use for him, just to keep him around.  Just to show him I love him, no matter how technologically ancient he may be at this point.

OH SOB.






I do love this new computer, though.  I cannot get over how easy it is to type on this keyboard!  It's lovely and will undoubtedly make the paper-writing process that much more simple for me in the next few weeks.




But still.  I feel a little guilty."

"event","Today I am reminiscing about the end of my semester in Barcelona, since it's been about a year.  It's actually really scary how quickly the time has passed.  I suppose that is the nature of time these days.  Or something.

Anyway, a year ago I was approaching the easiest finals week I've ever experienced and preparing to go to England.  A couple days ago, it was El dia de Sant Jordi (St. George's Day) and I got really nostalgic about Barcelona.  I miss it a lot, sometimes.  I miss the tiny cafe con leches, the chocolate croissants, and the structure of European cities.  I miss the public transit and the sunny weather (I only experienced one thunderstorm while in Barcelona).  Yet at the time, I was really excited to go home and do all kinds of things I couldn't do while in Europe--so I guess you win some, you lose some.

Now it's 2010 and my time at Grinnell is coming to an end.  I'm slightly more freaked about leaving Grinnell than I was about leaving Barcelona, but mostly because I still have a lot to do.  I only have two more full weekends in Grinnell, and that's only if I don't go home for David's graduation.  It's not so much that I wll miss weekend life at Grinnell.  Rather, I tend to count things off by weekends (at least this semester), and the fact that I only have two (at most) here is starting to scare me a lot!

I am excited about TFA, though.  Despite my neurotic social anxiety about it, I am very much looking forward to the challenge of working with students.  I am excited about working at my school next year and getting to be a part of a passionate community that's excited about something more important than self-indulgent weekend activities.  I'm excited to get away from a lot of the college mindset and culture, but there are a good number of people I will definitely miss.  

I don't really know why I'm writing this.  Perhaps it's a way to deal with my highly mixed feelings about college coming to an end.  Last semester and at the beginning of this semester, I was nothing but excited to get out of Grinnell for good.  Now that we're reaching the end, though, I'm definitely getting a little sadder about it.  A little.  

Oh well.  I think I'll go hang out with Maddie now.

(PS: Logan Jr. is in Memphis now!  Hurrah!)"

Perhaps my mood is about 1000000% times better than it otherwise would be because of the following things:

- Logan Jr. left Shanghai this morning on his way to me!
- I did all my reading AND finished my annotated bibliography/abstract a whole day early.  BAM.

Then I discovered <a href=""http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com"">this</a>.  I've been reading it on and off all afternoon, giggling crazily to myself both in the privacy of my own home and while at work (oops).  I feel like someone put Mia Thermopolis, Bridget Jones, and Natalie Dee in a blender to make one incredibly hilarious person.  It is fantastic.

Anyway.  Today I am feeling much better than yesterday.  MOOD SWINGS!  Here are some reasons today is good:

- I got my CREDIT CARD!  It has a picture of beautiful mountains on it (I chose this design when applying for the card because I miss living near mountains).  Commence Operation Buy A Mac!
- I got some work done!  I am proud of myself for starting this annotated bibliography trash so early (aka yesterday).  It makes today-me feel good about myself.
- We started learning about Wittgenstein today in philosophy, and he's the first dude whose ideas I actually like and understand.  The latter is actually really important and so surprising that I want to keep reading his work to see if I can still understand it without the aid of my professor's incredibly detailed explanations.  At any rate, I hope there is a paper prompt about him for the final paper.

That is all.  Time to go work some more on the stupid annotated bibliography . . ."

I wish school was over, but that I could play frisbee with the team whenever I wanted.  I wish I was living in Chicago, but in a place that was convenient for everyone involved.  I wish I wasn't so nervous about meeting all these new TFA people and having to make friends again after all the disastrous things that have happened with some of my friendships at Grinnell (and, of course, having to leave behind so many new and wonderful friendships found to fill to voids that others left).  I wish I was faster, leaner, and more aggressive when playing frisbee so that I would feel like I was contributing more to the team.

This week has been surreal and I just don't feel like doing ANYTHING right now.  I couldn't even muster the strength to cook tonight/any night this week, so tonight I bought a few frozen meals (in addition to other groceries) in anticipation of not having any prepared food for the rest of the week.  It's gross and lazy, but I am just feeling so icky and morose right now that I think eating frozen dinners out of their plastic containers fits well with my general feelings of extreme gloom.  Barf."

"event","Well, it's been an interesting Tuesday.

I'm a little upset with myself for leaving my application materials with an incompetent girl at the mailroom, who promised she would send them out UPS ground.  Now I have almost no way of knowing whether she actually sent them out AND I didn't get a tracking number for the package.  Hmmm.  Sometimes I really lack foresight.  Stupid stupid stupid.

Regardless of my own stupidity, the level of incompetence at the mailroom is actually astonishing.  No one knows what envelope to use for a UPS ground shipment, no one knows the password to be able to get into the computer that lets you create UPS labels, and no one knows when the supervisors who actually have this information will be back.  It's really upsetting to me that I have to depend upon students who have no idea what they're doing.  Unless you ask them to match your last name up with a parcel that's arrived for you, forget it.  They have no clue.  It's ridiculous and amazing to me that they aren't better trained to meet the needs of students who are likely sending out time-sensitive material to places like jobs, internships, families, etc.  GARARARARARARARGH.

1. Am enjoying living in my house, despite the ants in the kitchen.
2. Am finding myself enjoying my housemates' company--which I've had more this week than pre-spring-break.
3. Today while biking home from the library, it suddenly hit me that, as ready as I am to get out of Grinnell and away from academia, I <i>will</i> miss springtime here, when the campus is all freshly-green and sunny.
4. I will miss frisbee an inordinate amount.
5. Due to some unfortunate papers that I wrote pre-spring-break, I am actually determined to do well in my classes (although this determination sometimes gets interrupted by strong bouts of not caring).
6. I am getting nervous about living in the city next year.

This may all be due to the fact that I dropped my MAP and didn't have time to bask in its absence during midsems week.  However, I am going to chalk it up to the sudden realization that we only have like, five weeks of class + one week of finals left.  This is nuts.  I've been pining away for graduation and now that it's imminent, I'm getting scared.  What the hell?

Anyway, this weekend has been lovely so far.  Lots of frisbee, food, and friends.  Friday after practice, had enormous leftovers potluck with Maddie and Hart that turned into an evening's affair with beer, ice cream, and everything.  Today was more frisbee (coed scrimmage, not as fun as women's only but okay) and then dinner at La Cabana with Ethan.  V.g.  Am not sad at all about missing my last Drag Show, last Mary Be James, etc. because never really did care about those that much, anyway.  Care way more about the people here than the silly events which am expected by some to take part in.  Although I would assume that that expectation has disappeared over the course of nearly-4 years spent grumping around about Harris parties.

Now am sitting in bed with a pile of books all around me, and for some mad reason I am reading <i>In Memoriam</i> by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.  Mostly am reading it because I want to get ahead in mundane everyday schoolwork so can work extra hard on final three papers of undergrad.  But the poetry and the elegiac style is growing on me.  I guess.  I still find I don't have that much to say about poetry, though, a problem that's plagued me since the beginning of college.  Oh well.

Am starting to feel happier here, suddenly, without really expecting it or trying.  Will definitely miss many things about Grinnell when have graduated and moved into smog-plagued city, although more often than not I curse small-town Iowa for its isolation and lack of modern amenities (see: lack of SuperTarget).

"event","1. Triple interview punch during the 27-or-so hours between Wednesday at 1:30 and Thursday at 4:30.
2. Relatedly, I am nervous about meeting all of these people from the school where I'm interviewing.  I want to make a good impression, but am worried that I'll fall over or say something dumb in front of them.
3. Meeting TFA people.  I am afraid it will be like Barcelona redux, where I look forward to it and then get my hopes dashed because the people share absolutely zero things with me other than that we are humans and live on the earth.
4. My grades this semester.  So far I've slacked in every class because I was busy freaking out about/working on my thesis.  Now that I have the signatures needed to drop it for realz, I should have more time . . . but hopefully my grades aren't too shitty to salvage?
5. This paper I have to write for Wednesday.  Gah.  It's going to be bad.  I think.  I don't know.  We're supposed to find criticism and engage with it, but I just don't like the criticism I've found.  I think this is going to be one of those ""rip off the bandaid quickly and get it over with"" type of papers.

So, tonight I am going to work on #5.  Here goes."

"event","LOL I am such a bad student this semester.  I have a 10-page paper due tomorrow afternoon and I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED WRITING YET!  I do have a bit of an outline going, though, so I guess that's something.  I am now tucked away in my room, belly full of cheesy foods (not the greatest decision ever, but oh well) and getting ready to write this stupid paper.

<b>6:14pm:</b> PAPER WRITING COMMENCE.  I am watching Casino Royale to facilitate this paper-writing experience, naturally.

<b>6:46pm:</b> Outline sort of done.  Whatever.  It's time that I started actually writing a paper.  So far I have like 3 sentences.  Yessss.

<b>7:10pm:</b> I am missing frisbee practice for this stupid paper.  Gragh.  I just finished page 1 of the paper, though!  My goal is to write 8 solid pages.  We shall see if that works out . . .

<b>7:41pm:</b> Watching Pokemon now.  Just finished my second page!  Wooooo.  Feeling v. sleepy.  Also my stomach hurtssss.

<b>8:02pm:</b> Hellll yes.  Just finished page 3.

<b>8:29pm:</b> Ugh.  Tummy feels funny.  Tired.  Need coffee.  Have almost written four full pages.

<b>9:33pm:</b> Have coffee, am stuck in my writing.  I hope my professor won't mind too much that I am using an internet encyclopedia to help achieve an understanding of this stupid philosopher man who interestingly turned out to be a Nazi.  (And of course I'm going to cite the internet thing.  No worries.)

<b>9:50pm:</b> Paper progress moving again.  Am almost done with page 5.  This is going rather more smoothly than anticipated.  Maybe I will get to go home and take a nap after class tomorrow morning!  YAY!

<b>11:02pm:</b> TIRED TIRED TIRED.  Also, have hit a roadblock in this godforsaken paper.  Augh.  Paper is currently winning this night.

<b>11:34pm:</b> Upshot of all this paper-writing is that I think I now understand Frege's notion of sense really well.  Bad thing: my finger (the one I jammed the other week at practice) hurts.  Not good.  6.5 pages!  Oh also I watched an episode of HIMYM and am now starting the Lion King.  Obviously.

<b>12:06am:</b> OMG it's totally thundering out!  Spring!  Thunderstorms!  Snow melting away!  11 days until I go to Portland!  (that's weird, but cool!)  I'm starting to get very very sleepy and am not really sure what it is that I'm writing anymore.  Woooops.

<b>12:42am:</b> PAPER SLAIN.  Well, perhaps not in terms of content/coherence, but DEFINITELY in terms of length.  8.3333333 pages, bitches."

"event","1. Mr. C. has really random photos--like one of a Gumby figurine?--in one of his facebook albums.  That's a sentence I never thought I'd say.

2. I am listening to Phantom Planet for the first time in a long time.  Is good and reminds me of junior year of high school.  Despite not listening to much music these days other than Olympics-related stuff, I am still good for associating music with memories.

3. Must write this goddamn paper.  Agh.  Is currently 3:14pm.  Need to finish in time for frisbee party.  Gahh.

4. Room is a disaster.  Sometime (perhaps tomorrow) should clean it out and do laundry and nub."

mr. chinese food delivery guy 

bud light presents real american heroes 
today we salute you, mr. chinese food delivery guy 
without you, we'd be forced to do the unthinkable 
when we wanted chinese: drive to a restaurant 
but you, sir, bring it to us in under twenty 
armed with your rickety bike, you battle traffic,
 bad weather, and the occasional busted elevator. 
and why do you do it? because somewhere some guy 
is waiting for his kung pow crab puffs, 
and he's got a dollar fifty seven with your name on it 
so crack open an ice cold bud light oh mercenary of 
the mandarin chicken, and know that when america is 
looking for a man to get the job done, you do deliver. 

AND....


Mr. Nudist Colony Activity Coordinator 

Bud Light Presents: Real Men of Genius 
Today we salute you, Mr. Nudist Colony Activity Coordinator. 
 Wearing nothing but a whistle and a clipboard, 
you're living the real American dream: 
getting paid to think up fun things to do, naked. 
(Runnin' free!) 
Sure there's danger- vinyl chairs, sunburns, chaffage... 
and lawn darts? Completely out of the question. 
(Watch out now!) 
Your keen instincts tell you to stick to activities that involve 
lots of bouncing and jiggling. And if that doesn't work, who cares? 
You're all naked. 
(It's your birthday!) 
So crack open an ice-cold Bud Light, nudie boy, 
because we all know, when the going gets tough, the tough get naked. 
(Mr. Nudist Colony Activity Coordinator)


AND THEN....


MR. EDIBLE UNDERWEAR MAKER 


Today we salute you Mr. Edible Underwear Maker 
Your true genius combined two of mans favorite things 
Panties and Food 
(I can taste it now) 
They're a snack, they're underwear, they're a snack AND underwear. Brilliant. 
(Two treats in one) 
Gorgeous Grape, Rock My World Rasberry, Bodacious Banana 
(Twenty Six Flavors) 
And nothing says, ""I want you"" like a mouthful of underpants 
(Iwaanchoo mmbabyf) 
So crack open an ice cold BUd Light Mr. Edible Underwear Maker 
Because thanks to you, when it comes to panties, extra large means extra yummy 
(yummy, yummy, yummy)"

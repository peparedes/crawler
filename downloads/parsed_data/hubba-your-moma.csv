"event","summer is coming to an end. :( only 2 days till school! I'm happy, but not at the same time. I hope i get some good teachers, and have good classes. This year, I am going to do things a lot differently. For all of the people who I maybe didnt get along with last year or whatever, I just wanted to say sorry, and i hope that we can start over this year. A lot of times, my words were twisted, and people lied, but maybe if i wasnt such a bitch, that wouldn't happen. So, I am sorry. 

anyways...today was really fun. In the morning i had to go running and do my ""training workout"" (that is what my dad calls it, lol) then I went to the park to shoot around a littl bit. After that, my dad and I went and bought some heavier weights for training. Then, we ate at La Salsa..mmmmm, after that, we went to Gelsons to load up on stuff that we already have, lol. then, we went back home. We hung out for a little bit, but then my dad decided to go to the beach. I stayed home and waited for Frankee (who is like one of my best friends EVER lol) to pick me up to go to her niece's party. OMG, it was SOOOO much fun..now that I am back home, I am bored out of my mind..lol

I know that this is kind of different, but after all of my journal entries, i am going to leave a quote...today's quote is: ""If you don't use it, you lose it.""

                                     Thanks for reading, and PLEASE COMMENT!

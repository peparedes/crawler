Mateo sent the Inner Swine* king a vintage Alpini postcard featuring wine, a wench, and a musty cellar...
""Dear Swine (& Dutchess): I can't believe that you guys were in Italia! I wish that I had known. I'd have extended
an invitation for a visitation upon which libations would have gratuitously be bestowed upon ye to the delight of thy
hedonistic self. Gratis, of course, as a gracious host am I.""
He replied in the winter 2009 issue:
""Well, who knew ? I'm shy about letting people know when I'm in town, though, because I am convinced you all want to depants me and film it and put it up on the Youtubes. YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME, YOU BASTARDS!""

How did he know i wanted nothing more than to depants him? Though I wouldn't dare share it on youtubes. The idea is to get delight out of his embarrassment, not his humiliation. Even a pig deserves some dignity.

*an old fashioned zine with some decent writing in it. the kind the provides me with some respite when I'm having some intestinal distress"

"event","I am heartbroken. I decided to purchase an FW series VAIO notebook, and they are no longer available. As in, they have a new F series instead. I don't want that one!


Damnit, I need to start my search over. I am looking for a notebook that can handle Photoshop and Dreamweaver, doesn't get too hot, 6 GB, preferably a solid state hard drive (more durable and quiet, right?), WiFi, and will allow me to easily transfer documents to/from my external hard drive and the Dell desktop I have. High performing graphics card. This going to be used as a desktop replacement for a small business, but has to be a notebook so I can take it with me from time to time. I'm going to be in Hawaii, and I'm telling you... the sunlight/glare can be a problem on the road. That would be a nice bonus if the screen is able to compensate for that.

I can haz helps?"

Like, come on people.... everyone has lost that sense of community, their tact, their patience, their humor. What about some common kindness?<br /><br />The A Day In My Life community was spotlighted, so I perused. I found a sister community for Adult ADIMY. So I tried to add. Holyfuck there are a lot of rules spanning throughboth of these communities. Rules in different areas and FAQs or whatever. But I took the time to read through everything. I was a little taken aback at the extent of the rules, but far be it from me to dog someone for trying to maintain a certain level of decency in their community, especially being highlighted and all. <br />One of the rules was that my own journal had to look like a human actually ran it with current journal entries and my online time-to-number of entries should be decent. Well, I spend a hel of a lot more time LOOKING on LJ than I do writing. So, I tried leavinga&nbsp; comment in the add-me-ish portion of the community to say &quot;hi. this is me. I am a real person. I don't know how you determine my ration, but it's way off, but I assure you I am of pure intention and look forward to joining your community.&quot; I couldn't post it there because I was blocked from posting comments, so I posted in the moderator's journal on the entry pertaining to his community.<br /><br />This what ensued, which cracks me up:<br /><div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">I've just requested membership in your adult ADIML. I'm unsure of how you can tell how many hours I spend on LJ versus how many posts I actually make, which threw me for a loop! My ratio is probably all off. I'm on here all the time! :-D <br />Anyhow, in case it isn't clear, I post regularly on my LJ, but it's by default all friends only. <br />I also post in other communities, which may not be apparent by looking at my journal. While I maintain a tiny pic community called rural_photos. I won't be making any advertisements or anything for my community, I promise. I'd find it inappropriate.<br /><br />I look forward to joining the community (both of them, really). My hope is that I find one or the other &quot;better&quot; and drop one.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />coco_beans<br /><br />I tried posting this in the actual community, as I can see others were able to complain about being denied.

Burying me is the final part of the funeral process. The memorial, if any, should be before my burial. And everyone can walk away from the burial and be done with it. No punch and cookies at the house afterwards.<br />I want my body to be cleaned, perfumed, and naked, wrapped in undyed raw silk or cotton. I mean perfumed in something like sandalwood and rose oils.<br />I want loose flowers or strands of flowers as opposed to cut flower and garland displays. See: hindu funeral. <br />I do not want a flag of any sort (although those are mostly for military funerals, huh?). <br />I'd like to be buried with a Bahai burial ring.<br />I'd rather a small orange, mock orange, or lemon tree for my headstone than a headstone.<br />I'd like all my possessions to be given to charity, deeds/volunterism etc done in my memory, and if I had any money, that can just be given to my husband or brother, sister, and sister in law for them to decide how to use it. <br />I'd like to be remembered for being entertaining, talented, generous, and a little against the grain. I'd also like to be fondly remembered for my nasty habits and attitude. <br />I don't want speeches, but a book where people write what they remembered about me... not &quot;she had such a beautiful light in her eyes,&quot; but &quot;once she ate a whole pizza.&quot;<br /><br />"

I've been searching aorund online with simple Google inquiries on &quot;curve adjustments&quot; or &quot;working with curves,&quot; but all the tutorials overwhelm me with jargon and complexity. Perhaps I need to get my ass into a real class, or get a tutor? If you know of a decent book, website, or whathaveyou that I might use, I'd be much obliged. Thank you in advance.<br />How should I learn about curves?! How did you learn?<br />I relatively smart and adept at learning, but I'm not really patient.

I relate most to the uptight, OCD, take charge, smart, distrusting, easily cross, and loyal Rabbit. I also pretty much share the same body shape as Rabbit.

&quot;You and I have brains. The others have fluff.&quot; - Rabbit

Rabbit happens to be one of the two animals in the 100 Acre Wood who has a brain and for this very reason he counts himself to be an important member of the 100 Acre Wood. He also comes across as a responsible rabbit and is a good friend of Winnie the Pooh. He is always practical in all matters and keeps his friends on the go; at times the other characters unintentionally raise his ire. Rabbit likes to organize things, write notices signed Rabbit and see what everybody else think about them. He also likes to take charge of group events, even if nothing gets done. He is probably the smartest amongst all his other animal friends in the forest (that&rsquo;s his personal opinion), and he is mostly the self-appointed leaders of the entire group. Rabbit at times comes across as being stubborn when it comes to his viewpoints. He also tends to overreact in haste but all of his friends are aware that beneath his slightly bristly exterior lies a good heart. Once he realizes his mistake, he has the ability to admit that he was wrong.
  Rabbit starts off in the 100 Acre Wood as the owner of a single hole and in that hole Pooh finds himself stuck. He is very particular about his garden and won&rsquo;t allow even his best friends in when he is at work within his garden. He also displays certain reluctance when any newcomer is visiting him; this is evident in the first book itself when he meets Kanga &amp; Roo for the 1st time. On their arrival, Rabbit is a bit skeptical to meeting them. But with some passage of time he settles to become good friends with all.
  Rabbit has quite a number of relatives and friends and thus he considers himself to be a good organizer. When a situation demands good organization then Rabbit is at his best. He relishes having the opportunity to organize a plan and take charge of the situation, one such plan that Rabbit planned was to scare Kanga which he did by hiding Roo. He also put together a plan to &ldquo;unbounce&rdquo; Tigger. When there is a search operation that is undertaken to Search for Small that too is organized by Rabbit. Though he meticulously plans each of his plans yet he misses some finer details which in turn lead them going wrong is some way. He usually includes Pooh and Piglet while planning and if ever he needs an opinion then he approaches Owl when there is &ldquo;thinking to be done&rdquo;.
  As for his relationship with Christopher Robin, he is of the opinion that Christopher is the one who tends to depend on this relationship. Rabbit also has very cordial relations with all the other small insects and animals that reside in the forest. These animals and insects are usually referred to as being his &ldquo;friends &amp; relations&rdquo;. Many of them have a name for identification such as a beetle called Alexander Bettle, a wasp named Small, there is one more beetle who is names Henry Rush, additionally there are 3 unspecified creatures referred to as Late, Smallest-of-All and Early. So large is Rabbit&rsquo;s family that according to his estimates he would require 17 pockets if the need would arise to carry his entire family along with him.
  Rabbit resides in a house that is located in the Northern Central area of the 100 Acre Wood, lying amidst the sandy pit where Roo plays and the section where his friends-and-relations reside. His favorite food is vegetables and that's why he loves gardening.
  Rabbit hates being interrupted when he is engaged in any activity and he hates being bounced. He also tries to avoid Pooh at Lunchtime, sometimes without success."

My debate is never really on whether I want something sweet versus savory for breakfast. I am always either wanting something cold or something warm, depending on the weather and my mood. Most often though, it must be on the soft side. I don't usually like raw vegetables or unsoaked All Bran for breakfast. Crispy bacon would be my only exception to this rule, as it crumbles easily."

We bought a skeleton Smurf, a WWI&nbsp;iron plate with skulls on it, and an indonesian mask (also iron) for the wall. We're pretty stoked on the purchases.
We also got free wine and cake. In Italy it's a normal thing to have free wine and assorted things (hot chocolate, risotto, cake, etc.) at fairs. Free wine in the USA?! That'd never work. 
I went to make the duck and it was rotten. Oh nothing as nasty as rotten poultry. Well, it wasn't as bad as teh time a big pot of rotten chicken parts fell on my head, but it was nasty. Things kept coming up and I wasn't able to cook it in time. I had it in the fridge 5 days. Ugh. Such a fucking waste.
Now I am trying to resist eating a bagel, which I want desperately. I keep saying we can't have bagels in the house, but Mateo doesn't understand. He just keeps getting them."

"event","I don't celebrate Christmas much. Growing up, we only celebrated it if Grandma came to town with her dust-filled boxes of random joy and crap.
So, anything I do for the holidays is kind of a big deal for me.
This year Mateo got the night of Eve off. We went to the organic winery that I probably already mentioned for lunch. We stuffed ourselves silly on: gnocchi with gorgonzola and walnuts, bigoli pasta with duck sauce, a spinach/ricotta cheese/sausage puff pastry, beef burgundy (which was fabulous) with polenta and green beans, and turkey with carrots and mashed potatoes. All this was accompanied by wine, interesting conversation, and finally finished with some yogurt cake with ice cream and marmalade. Seriously. 
Before we pigged out we stopped off at the church on post and dropped off baby formula, diapers, and 6-10 bags of non-perishable groceries and personal hygiene goods. That was my good deed. Mateo thinks it's nothing but a bandaid on a gaping wound, but I love doing that stuff. I think it's more than the items, it's increasing positivity in the world, even if it's only just our own world. Baby formula is expensive! Holyshit. Which, despite the scientific research &amp; testing needed, the vitamins in it, etc, I think that consumers are getting ripped off. 
We ended up passing out before 9pm. I'm awake again and it's 11am the following day. Needless to say, I missed midnight mass. I was a little curious to go. I would not have understood a word, but it would be neat see the neighbors. The bells at midnight did wake us up for a short bit.
I had bad dreams. I had dreams about emergencies, dead dolphins with skin flapping in bloody water, but by the time I had my final dream I figured out how to stop the disaster from happening. Lucid dreaming.
Mateo is depressed. There is nothing I can do. If I turn him in for help, he'll lose his job and we'll have no place to go. Instead, I just have to deal with utter crankiness, moods, and statements. I am so bad when it comes to dealing with other people's feelings. I'm beginning to think everything I touch around me falls apart, rots, or in other words, turns to shit. I'm trying to keep the positivity. I noticed when I'm depressed, every one and every thing around me seems fine and it is just&nbsp;ME that is the problem. When I am fine, every one and every thing a round me is not okay."

"event","I realized this evening that I understand quite a bit more Italian than I give myself credit for. This somehow encourages me to try harder and see how much MORE I can learn.<br /><br />Pizza was excellent. Three types to choose from, of which I ate three: hot dog and extra cheese, radicchio, and prosciutto cotto &amp; mushroom. The bitters drink I brought was even popular with the<em> </em>kids, as was the play-doh. <br />We have plans to get together again soon, when Mateo has a night off, to cook Persian food! yum.<br />I was talking Hedieah about her escape from Iran. It was interesting, as most escaping from evil government stories are. Her father was actually originally Russian. He &amp; his family escaped Russia sometime between 1920-1930 (Stalin's rule, and that whole Five-Year Plan) to Iran (then Persia). He and his family always considered it a temporary move. They never returned. They never could. Conditions at &quot;home&quot; were never right. <br />Then, in 1979 the family he grew up to create had to leave Iran. AGAIN, they thought the move would be temporary. They thought the country would right itself and things would be better in just a few years. Three years turned into thirty. The oldest generations (from Russia/Soviet Union) are dead now. Hedieah always rolled her eyes at their longings to go back to Russia/USSR when she was a child in Iran, but now she is in the same boat: her generation now speaks of going back to Iran. She was 10 when they left.<br />She has no family left in&nbsp;Iran, but does have friends still there. The young ones have only know this environment, the old ones have died to never see it return to the country of their childhood. It's sad.<br /><br />Being a Bahai, I grew up around a few Persian families. They talked about Iran, taught me some Farsi, and I really learned a lot about the Persian culture. I always wanted to go to Iran. I told them that I&nbsp;would some day go to Iran. More than Isreal, I wanted to go to Iran. Even though adults don't contradict a child's dreamings, it didn't seem like they were biting their cheeks when they'd tell me they believed I would go to Iran some day. Now, I think all of us have different sentiments. I'm sad. Iran is this dreamland, my mecca, a thrilling and unique paradise that I'll never experience. Not simply because of the corruption, but because even if that ceased this evening, the world I was told about and imagined no longer exists. Hedieah said that the sentiment she gets from the people she still knows in&nbsp;Iran is that they are tired. very tired.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

This evening changed my mind. I love Verona. Fantastic!<br /><br />Aside from getting pulled over by the police and having major communication issues with the ladies, we got to Verona in time to watch the sunset from the top of the Arena (Verona's Colosseum). <br />Of course, we were having a dandy time in the Arena: taking pictures, freaking out over my sudden vertigo at the edge, admiring the view, &quot;running&quot; up the seats, testing the acoustics, etc. Finally, the cold breeze at the top got to me, and I wanted to move on, which turned out to be more difficult than expected. First, we had to remember which door we came in. <div style=""text-align: center;""><img height=""225"" width=""300"" align=""left"" alt="""" src=""http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/7/l_11b608dd8bf74858b9914058bbbdcdff.jpg"" /><strong>&quot;Here it is!&quot; <br />&quot;It's closed.&quot; </strong><br />Perhaps I was mistaken? <br /><strong>No. </strong><br />ALL of them were closed. locked.</div><br />We got locked into the Arena. We walked along the edge, the bottom, we even pushed past barriers and got an interesting, albeit panicked, look behind the scenes. <br />&quot;I'm breaking down this wooden barrier!&quot; Mateo says determinedly.<br />&quot;Well, you try that. I'm going to bang on the metal door and scream for help through this rust hole,&quot; I said (thinking it was a decidedly better idea) <em>&quot;AUITAME! </em><img height=""225"" width=""300"" align=""left"" alt="""" src=""http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/17/l_95b39258a60f4dcaa3e4171ee986bdcf.jpg"" /><em>PER&nbsp;FAVORE!&nbsp;AUITA!&quot;</em><br />None of that worked to our unpleasant surprise. I was about to bust into the fire hose and pull the alarm, when a couple enters the Arena. They snuck in... through a wide opening cleverly marked in large letters: &quot;USCITA&quot; (exit)<br />Oopsy. Everyone had gone home. They locked all the doors, except the large can't miss it EXIT door, which neither of us seemed to be able to see for the last 45 minutes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />All that excitement, panic, and final relief brings hunger, so we stopped at a market food stand and got <em>Fritelle con Nutella</em>. Yum! Orange scented dough, fried in a disc shape, dipped in sugar and smeared with Nutella, folded in half: Sweet Italian tacos. We enjoyed those listening to a Peruvian flute and avoiding an angry, drunk man on a cell phone.<br />We also shopped around in the square for a hat and moved on to stroll the decorated streets.<br />How romantic everything was! And, the cold, but not bitterly so, weather was clear and perfect.<br /><br />Thirst over came us, and this wine &amp; grappe store/bar was too intriguing to pass up. Enoteca Dal Zovo. <img height=""225"" width=""300"" align=""left"" alt="""" src=""http://www.enotecadalzovo.it/images/foto19g.jpg"" />Fabulous. Mateo bought a bottle of absinthe. You should check the guy's website out for some amusing pictures of the owner who tended to us and to get an idea of what the store looks like inside. It's crammed with dusty bottles, liquors, magazines, bags, and knick knacks. He's even got a naked chicks calendar at the counter. The clock is a large spider and he seems to really enjoy the nautical themed items. <a href=""http://www.enotecadalzovo.it""><u><strong>www.enotecadalzovo.it</strong></u></a><br />When I was sitting in one of the only two clear spots in the store, I picked up a magazine. The first picture I looked at in the magazine looked familiar: It was the store we were sitting in! This pleasant little bar/shop was featured in Bell'Italia. Alongside it, there was a review for an osteria not far away. We decided the article was spot on about the bar, so we ventured over to the osteria for dinner. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Boy, the osteria was indubitably an excellent choice for people watching, fine wines, and fabulous food. Our waiter wouldn't stop smiling in this hilarious and endearing manner. The menu is written on a small s<img height=""225"" width=""300"" align=""right"" src=""http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/49/l_add3aa694cf54695b9ffcd09e7a7affa.jpg"" alt="""" />heet of paper for the night. The list, you can imagine, is not long. I got carrot soup and Le Crespelle. Mateo got the first thing on the menu. The owner said something about it being horsemeat. He was all IN&nbsp;on that. The food was great. My Crespelle turned out to be crepes stuffed with ricotta and radicchio. It was incredibly rich and divine. His horsemeat was a stew with a side of polenta. We got out of there for under 45 euro, which, considering the quality and amount of wine and food we had (including an appetizer and small apertif, we were stuffed nicely) was not a bad deal. The crowd arrived just at the end of our meal. I can imagine the menu sells out nightly.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Then we went onward for sightseeing in the dark along the river. <br />Around a dark corner I heard commotion. Apparently the traveling German Christmas Market was in town (this side of town). So we bought a tin robot and more wine: gluhwine. The square was one of the best finds. The architecture around there was great: variety and detail and colors. The frescoes on the walls were disappearing, but enough remained that you could easily imagine how fanciful it looked when it was a new neighborhood. <br />Around the corner from THAT square I fell in love with a building. It was like a set from some play I'd dream I was the lead. <br /><br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""More pictures behind the cut....""><br /><br /> <div style=""text-align: center;""><img height=""400"" width=""300"" src=""http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/64/l_6d6a59ba91204ad7ad4ae6c81dc00a0d.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><img height=""400"" width=""300"" src=""http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/3/l_cbd3cfb516e1462c9f7a39ba48d0f01e.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><img height=""299"" width=""400"" src=""http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/38/l_a58fe5b6f9c44bddb0dcbcf3e6356101.jpg"" alt="""" /></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><img height=""300"" width=""400"" src=""http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/60/l_ac0798c628bc41cfb621b53bab63373c.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img height=""300"" width=""400"" src=""http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/14/l_90ea345d1b7d464ca3b2c335b13b447e.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img height=""533"" width=""400"" src=""http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/20/l_25f7093434b84a41a85f9db41c94c70a.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img height=""300"" width=""400"" src=""http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/59/l_f16987ca6c4941da8991d21b0929de9e.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img height=""300"" width=""400"" src=""http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/46/l_19261b2c76774930a49877be11e80d80.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img height=""533"" width=""400"" src=""http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/3/l_db787cc762cd45fda8dd1e25f32d56fa.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img height=""533"" width=""400"" src=""http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/49/l_ea8335360d6b4e9aa3e1d2c24df23349.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img height=""300"" width=""400"" src=""http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/58/l_269e635878de4307ad4000756f5bc082.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img height=""300"" width=""400"" src=""http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/10/l_f04e6c2692c347bf83d28c88c5aaf9d8.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img height=""533"" width=""400"" src=""http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/48/l_975610b1a06841b390818ab580d02f8e.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img height=""533"" width=""400"" src=""http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/47/l_432382fd03a2410b89a4e822c7cae329.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img height=""299"" width=""400"" src=""http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/27/l_0238a502cd4d41f68d5e4897fd49fb5d.jpg"" alt="""" /></div></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><br />&nbsp;</div><br /></lj-cut>"

I feel like I should have never spoiled her. I should have never given her a taste of what real living is like. Not that I could have ever stopped myself from spoiling her. She was just the most adorable little dog. She was a quick learner, totally appreciative, and playful. I miss her. Thankfully I know exactly where she lives. When I have the time, I will drive by and report anything suspicious, so that she can be adopted out to someone else.
The poor thing threw up plastic, seeds, and sticks the first night I had her. They leave her outside with no food and no water, in the rain and snow. She's so tiny and exceptionally well-behaved inside, I can't believe they'd leave her outside for any reason. She doesn't stink, shed, or tear up things. 
Needless to say, I'm very sad.

I like interesting combinations of foods, so something salty, something sweet, something spicy, all at once would probably be supreme.

I love animals. All animals. Wait, almost all animals. I don't care for Baboons all that much. They're grotesque in features, and a little scary in mannerisms for my taste.
Needless to say, I love dogs. I actually fancy myself a bit of a dog talker. Walks With Wolves would be my name.
I prefer terriers. Mixed terriers. I think that pure breeds are overrated (and inbred).
The first toy (as in, stuffed animal, not breed) I can remember having would be my Benji dog. It was a mutt. A terrier mix, I think. 
I can tell you that I really don't like German Shepherds and Labs. The golden retrievers are also a bit of a problem for me, although some who have come into the vet clinic lately have been appealing.
I also seem to have problems with Australian Shepherd Dogs. Everyone who has owned one, has let it be a bit out of control."

"event","I've been volunteering at the Vet clinic lately. I love it. If I had reliable transportation, I'd apply for the open position they have there.
Today a dog was bought in by a military police officer. Che Bella! She's a little black dog, actually named Bella. She was brought in because she's being abused and neglected by her owners. She the most awesome thing though...
I decided to take her home for the weekend, or else she'd have to stay at the clinic, alone this weekend.
I took her to ITR office because I had some work to get done. I eventually had her fall asleep on my desk. Then we walked home, in the rain, but I figured 4 miles in the cold rain-- she's endured worse, and I wanted to train her a little. I also wanted to wear her out so she'd sleep tonight instead of whine.
When we got home, I immediately bathed her, which she didn't like (shivered, despite the warm water), but she behaved well. 
Then it was FOOD time. She clearly hasn't eaten in awhile and that walk really did her in. She was starving.
While I was changing my clothes after her bath, she found some dried tortellini piece and started chomping on it. I took it away as soon as I could, and you could tell if she wasn't afraid of me, she would have bit my hand off. She wanted it so badly. Desperately. She snagged up the tiny bits I couldn't grab.
So 30 seconds into giving her some dog food with chicken and salmon, she was literally bouncing off the walls: so fucking happy to have food and shelter, warmth, a bath, and attention that she wanted to play and lick my face and thank me. But, I made her finish her food. 
When she was finished with dinner she hopped up onto the old couch and I wrapped her up in a blanket from the clinic.
Now she all bundled up in a blanket sleeping on the couch.
I pet her and snuggled with her until she fell asleep. She is such a cuddler. She likes to bury her nose under a blanket, a pillow, or your arm.
She's been abused, but she takes to soft things and luxury items easily.
She has little trust for most people. But, she's fallen into a nice niche here with me.
She is deathly afraid of men, but Mateo is curing her of that.
When I brought her home, Mateo was still sleeping. We introduced the dog and him in the dark while Mateo was still under the covers. She's used to his smell and doesn't mind him. She isn't exactly bouncing into his lap, but she did want to cuddle with him in bed. It's only been a few hours since I've had Bella, so I think Mateo will really help her out of the man-hating.
She's up for adoption.
I am not going to keep her. If Tricky wasn't coming to stay with us, in a heartbeat I'd take Bella. I just can't have two dogs. I don't want two dogs.
I will post some pictures of her on here this weekend.

I am ever so grateful for my husband, who despite no forewarning, allowed me to have the pup in the house without a protest."

I stuck myself with a needle (not during surgery) but it's minor. No more coffee for me! It makes my hands shake apparently.
""Hi. I'm Coral. I'm the new volunteer.""
""Are you a Baha'i?"" Sarah asks immediately. ""You MUST be. There aren't a lot of Corals around here.""
""Um, actually, yeah. Hi.""
""I'm a Baha'i, too. I've been told about you!!! Nice to meet you."" So I have a co-worker that is Baha'i, at least until December. She leaves soon.

We are now going over to her friend's house tonight for a get-to-know-you deal. I'm looking forward to meeting a Persian lady-Italian man couple that live really close to our house.
Mateo is nervous about it. He hates strangers. So, he's sitting on the toilet making poops at exactly the time we should be heading out the door."

"event","I made some tamarind soup and coconut rice with mangoes. Definitely not candida diet friendly, but what the hell, it's what I was craving.
I have an ear problem. Everything sounds like whah whah whah ala Charlie Brown. I saw the doctor and he said I have hay fever, allergies. Gave me stronger allergy medicine and a prescription for saunas and massages. ""You'll have a hard time trying to find someone who will take your insurance for massages, but here it is anyway.""
Tomorrow the hair gets cut and colored. 
This weekend we're attending a festival (or two).
BUT before then (on Friday) I work at the vet clinic!!!!!!!!!

I've been dying to buy some canvas to paint, but holding off because I never follow through on stuff like that.

Steve Dilley and I are friends on Facebook now. This is amusing and annoying."

"event","I lost my engagement ring. I really, really lost it. I think that it is somewhere in the pile of dirt on the porch, or in my newly planted pots. I am going to have to sift through all that dirt on my next day off. I don't want to wait, but it must be done meticulously in the light.

The bus driver this evening was a bit of a badass. He passed cars."

"event","Sometimes I think I am ridiculously lame.
Sometimes I think I am pretty damn awesome.
This evening I feel deservent of an especially good making of the love.
I have a feeling this weekend will be joyful.
Tomorrow there is a free punk concert by a band from Slovenia. It's hardcore, though--not exactly my cup of tea, but Mateo might enjoy it.
During the day we might venture over to Asolo in the hills for a relaxing jaunt and villa visit.
Sunday there will be falconry exhibition in the town next door. So, we'll stop over there and get some cheese and other produce, too, from the local vendors.
I also have a massage scheduled for tomorrow morning to start the weekend off right.
Unfortunately, I have not been able to rid myself of my headache enough to go to the horse exhibition. If we get bored on Sunday, we might go and see it on its last day in Verona."

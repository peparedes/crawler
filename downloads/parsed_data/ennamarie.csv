Let's not even get into how long it's been since I updated.)<br /><br /><em>Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you,<br />can't help it if there's no one else,<br />no, I can't help myself..</em><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Dear you,"">Dear you,<br /><br />I was just thinking about how long it'd been since I wrote something like this. :)<br /><br />I love you more everyday. I can't believe how lucky I am to have had someone like you for almost 3 years and to still feel like I just fell in love. You're the best.<br /><br />There was more to this in my brain earlier but it's gone now..I think I've said all the important parts.<br /><br />Always,<br />me</lj-cut><br /><br />On a different note, I have mentioned how terrified I am of the future? I know, I'm still a junior, I have a little while...right? But I swear that just a second ago I was a sophmore and a second before that just a little baby freshman. Now I'm edging up on halfway through my junior year and before I know it I'll be a senior and after that it's just looming black space! WTF. I don't even know how to go about getting ready for that.<br /><br />I know I'm lucky to be so sure about what I want to do in life. I know a lot of people go through college without being sure about their majors or what's best. So I'm ahead of the game in that sense. I love graphic design, I love art. I can't imagine any other career option that would make me even as close to as happy as I am doing those things. But just because I love it doesn't mean I know what to do! I don't feel like anything I've made is good enough to make a good portfolio..how am I supposed to get a job? Where do I want a job? Do I need more school? Ugh.<br /><br />(Don't even get me started on cubicle jobs. If I have to take a graphic design job working in an ugly little office cubicle I might die from my soul being sucked out. The only reason I've been able to handle the cubicle jobs I've had&nbsp;(like the one I have right now) is because I know they aren't permanent. I don't know how the people I work with are able to come in every day, all day, day in and day out and not just wither up. It's so..dull and&nbsp;monotonous. Do they honestly love what they do? If they do, that's great. But if they don't..why do it? I don't want a job that I don't love. I want to be happy with what I'm doing, not dreading it. -sigh-)<br /><br /><em>In about one year you'll have it all figured out,<br />these big city dream are what you're about..</em><br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","&nbsp;I've been meaning to write in here since I moved into the apartment and yet it is now two weeks later and I'm just getting around to it.

Anyway, I love our apartment. It's weird and old and creaky but I love it. The biggest downsides are no air conditioning and a slight beetle-y bug problem. It's all homey and comfy though. It is /still/ kind of a mess though. Partly because we cleaned and such but then went to Ikea and brought home a ton of stuff, thus creating a mess again until we get everything arranged and finished.

We might have painted a wall without asking. It's now a chalkboard. I'm hoping that no one will see it..and if they do..I'm hoping they won't be so extreme as to kick us out, ha.

Perhaps I shouldn't have written this in the morning while my head is full of snot, I feel like I should have more to say but I'm not sure I can think of it right now. Classes start in a few days, eek. I need a job! That's what I should be doing right now, looking for a job. -sigh-"

"event","&nbsp;I can't remember what I last wrote about..hmm.

In less then two weeks I move into the apartment..actually technically in less then two weeks Brandon will have moved in too. I'm really excited. I'm getting super restless here, I'm ready to be somewhere else now.

Speaking of being restless, I went jogging the other day and I actually enjoyed it! I'd never jogged outside before because I always figured it would just be more uncomfortable&nbsp;(hot, uneven surfaces, etc) then inside jogging and I hate inside jogging..but lo and behold, it was fun. I went by the river and it was nice and it got my mind off things. Plus it just felt so good after a few weeks of sitting all day at VGM and then coming home and sitting around at night because I'm tired from getting up early. I think I'll go again tonight because I'm not sure when I'll have the chance again this week. It's probably good for me to jog because I feel fat and nasty, ickkk. That's really a good motivator, actually.

Ugh, I just feel so gross and cooped up. Everything is boring and messy and repetitive and just..blah. I want to feel better about myself and better about my surroundings. I need to get myself into good habits and I need to start picking up and packing and just getting going.

One more week of work! My dad depressed me by saying the odds are that that is the kind of job I will end up with eventually. My response to that is..no way. Ever. No. I'd rather be a poor, happy artist then work in a horrible stifling office job every day for ever and ever. I know my dreams probably aren't that practical but I just don't know if I could do it any other way. My ideal job is to essentially freelance or to run my own business. In the beginning I'd be happy with working in a smaller business, hopefully designing something that doesn't bore me to tears.

Ok..got the internet/cable for the apartment set up (or the appointment made, anyway), need to fill out the online electric thing, e-mail the landlord about the gas thing. Changed my address online. I need a hair appointment! That doesn't fit in the same category, haha.

Ok, done."

Carrrr seeaaaat couuuuchhh.
I'm going to take a -waves hands- BATH!

In 3 weeks I move into the apartment, yay! Also -anxious!- Then 3 weeks from Saturdayyyy I pick up Brandon from the airport, more yay! I feel like there's 58394053292 things I should do before then but who knows what they are! Oh, here's some..

-fill out the forms for electricity and cable
-sort my clothes and get rid of some
-sort through boxes of stuff from school
-box up stuff to take
-put my money in the bank
-find out if we can paint
-figure out kitten stuff
-freak out

Ok, that last one doesn't count. Anyways.

North Carolina was kind of awesome. I didn't know if it would be or not but it was. Hugeeeemongus house just across the street from a beautiful beach. My family was lots of fun, as usual. Lots of random antics, mostly group meals, cooked together, which was nice. Boogie boarding was super fun. The crabs on the beach were scary and weird. All in all, lots of fun.

Work is possibly the most boring place in the whole wide world. It's good that they're laid back and that I really like everyone I work with because otherwise it would super suck. Two more weeks. Well, and tomorrow.

Oh! My car got crushed by a tree. I've talked about this enough elsewhere that I don't really feel like talking about it more here, but yeah, that happened. Huge oak tree, right on it. The biggest pain about it is that there was a lot of stuff in it, most of which got damp and/or covered in glass shards. Ugh. So..new car soon. Me and my cars aren't really friends, it seems.

Annnnnd..watching Big Brother and working on my blanket. I feel like I should exercise and be outside more but blah."

For almost two weeks I was out of the country, first in France, then Germany, then the Czech Republic. I was with my family and my parents two best friends. It was a lot of fun and we saw a lot of really cool things. I think I loved Paris the most, which I know is cliche but oh well. It was beautiful and interesting. I guess Prague would be second because it's similar to Paris in a lot of ways but I think things were a little more expensive and yet a little more run down there, so there you go. Germany was very pretty and nice but all the towns we saw were small river towns, cute but not much going on besides tourists. Paris and Prague were big cities, yes touristy but also just city-like, full of every kind of person and a billion things to see.<br /><br />I got home from that last Wednesday and on Friday I up and left again to California. I decided that three months was really too long to go without seeing Brandon (and he agreed, haha) and realized I was making money this summer and was entitled to spend some of it if I wanted. So, I went to LA for four daysish. It was a lot of fun and it was wonderful to see Brandon. :) I lovelove the mountains there, they're soooo pretty. I also loved the beach, even if I did get the worst sunburn ever on my legs..but I'm recovering, so it's cool. (Ok, it's cool except for when I do things that involve bending my legs, like climbing stairs or sitting down..then I make sad little whimpery noises. Ouch. :( =P)<br /><br />And nowwww on Friday I am going to North Carolina! Seriously, more traveling then I've ever done. Crazy. And we're DRIVING. Whoa. It'll be intense. But once we get there it should be good times..really, really fake Pennellwood, haha.<br /><br />Now..I am going to go eat a microwave cake. And roll yarn into a ball. How exciting.

It's not like I can't manage without you around, I'm ok, things are ok, but something always feels off and that's just it..things are only ok. You're the right one for me, I'm sure of it. I love you so much and I'm so happy we're together.

"event","&nbsp;Wow, I really need to work on updating this more. Not that anyone really reads it, I just like keeping track of my life a little.

So, summer. Woot. I was home for a few days, relaxing, then left on Thursday to do a Keith Urban tour and eventually end up in Urbana to see my sister graduate. First I went up to the Mall of America with a couple friends, which was quite successful (probably too successful, I spent too much money). Let's see..a skirt, a dress, a necklace, two tank tops, and a pair of shorts. Oh, and two little bottles of nailpolish. But I love it all and I had meant to buy myself some summer stuff so I was happy.

Keith was throughly impressive every time we saw him. My favorite was the second night, though the third had it's moments. (Haha, yes, my mom and I saw him three times in three days! We're crazy. Mostly my mom, she just took me along. =P) But the second night he was all smiles and laughing randomly the whole time and it was just fun. The third night I did get right up close to his little stage, which was pretty awesome. Quite squished and warm and screamy, but still cool.

I saw Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. I liked Wisconsin, I hadn't really been there much before. Lots of trees and rolling fields. Green Bay wasn't much to speak of but that's ok. Sunday we came back down to Champagne/Urbana, Illinois to see Sara get her master's degree. She's been living there two years and I'd never once seen her place or her school! Oops. Her graduation was quite boring, for the most part (like most graduations, you know). But it was a lot of fun to see her and her apartment. I spent the night there while my parents stayed at a hotel. She showed us her campus some this morning, it's really pretty. I think I still prefer Iowa State's, which is just as pretty but a bit smaller.

Now I'm finally home and I start work at VGM tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it, I guess. It'll be good to have something to do with my days and I know working there is pretty nice, as far as summer jobs go. I don't love the idea of 8 to 5, but it's good practice so I might as well get used to it.

In two weeks and a few days my family leaves for France. That'll be a lot of fun, I'm excited. I plan to take excessive photos in hopes with coming out with at least some good ones. I feel like it's been ages since I've taken photos for the sake of photography. I also plan to drink wine. ;)

I feel like there are so many things, little things like crafts and graphics and what not, that I have thought of to do this summer and now that summer is here I can't remember most of them. -sigh-

Well, this is quite the long update, so I'll cut it off here."

"event","&nbsp;Long time, no update. I think. Yeah.

First of all, I am in mourning. My goldfish Boots (or, more frequently, Bootsie, and sometimes Bootsarama) has passed away. I'm not sure why, precisely, but it happened. I feel guilty but I suppose there's no point in dwelling on that. But I am really sad about it. I know he was just a fish and most people past the age of, say, 7 don't really care when their fish die (because fish are prone to do that)..but I care. He was a very lovable fish and I had him almost a whole year. We'd bonded. He was a fish with a lot of character. He was always very excited when anyone came into the room..he would swim almost frantically at the front of his bowl. If you stuck your finger in (or at least if I stuck mine in..he seemed a little picky) the water, he'd nibble it. Sometimes he'd get so excited to swim somewhere that if the plant in his bowl was in the way, he's just swim on his side to get over it. Anyway, this was just my eulogy about Boots. He was a very good fish and I'll miss him. I might get another fish but I'm sure it won't be the same.&nbsp;(To make this an official sort of obituary..) He is survived by his friend Arnold, the snail. Arnold has a lot of algae on his shell, but he's still kickin'.

Second of all, I want to live in Chicago. I love&nbsp;(love love) it there. It's so pretty and interesting and full of life. I love the all the buildings and all the different kind of architecture. I love all the art stuff there. I love the random stores and restaurants. I can definitely see myself living there in the future and was in fact a little sad that I hadn't applied for school there to begin with. But no, I'm very happy here, so instead I will just look for jobs there later, I'm sure it's full of design firms.

Third of all, I love my family. I say this frequently. But they're great, I love spending time with them.

Fourth of all, I'm sad.

Fifth of all, I'll stop this now and maybe actually do some homework. Ha."

Oh, yeah, I supppose I should have actually started this entry with &quot;Hey, so, I went to California this week.&quot; I was going to go to Mexico with my family until we found out, two days before departure, that my passport is expired.

Anyway, I was pretty successful at the being by myself thing..admittedly both ways I got a little help getting my boarding pass and stuff but other then that.

California is sooo pretty. Mountains are like my new favorite thing. Iowa is so /flat/, haha. Other then that there were palm trees..and fruit trees (!!!)..and 5843950234 shopping/strip malls. I loved (lovedloved) seeing Hollywood..I'm so glad we went. And that I'm capable of catching taxis. Brandon helped. I wish we could have spent more time there..I would have liked to go to a museum and just to look around more. Towards the end there though we were getting into the sketch part of it anyways. =P

Anyway, I don't feel like summing up every little thing we did, so the the general summery is that I had a lot of fun. I wish I hadn't had to leave, actually.&nbsp;"

And do you know how often I feel nostalgic? A lot.

Falling in love with you are some of the best memories I have. I think it's good that I look back at my entries so often, so that those memories aren't lost. Of course they're cryptically embedded in what I wrote because I was falling for you long before I could just write it straight out.

I'm not actually sure if this happened last year or this year, it sort of overlapped, but either way.<br />2. Getting into the design program. A year of hard work and stress and anxiety totally paid off.<br />3. That Panic At The Disco concert we went to. It was super fun and not just because of the concert, but just the whole trip. Good stuff.<br />4. Wandering around the Des Moines area with Brandon. Or pretty much anything we spent our weekends doing.<br />5. Partying with my family and friends at (fake) Pennellwood.<br />(though that would also fit on the worst things of the year list---seeing closed down Pennellwood..so sad)<br />6. Making friends at school. I know this sounds dorky but it's always been hard/felt hard for me to make friends and I'm continuously thankful that I've managed to make such a nice group of friends. I love them, aw.<br />7. Oh, movies, I forgot that was in the prompt. Hmm. Horton Hears &nbsp;A Who. Adorable. &lt;3<br />8. Music...John Mayer, Flight Of The Concords, Sara Barielles.<br />9. Book..Love The One Your With, Breaking Dawn (I know, it was bad, but in such a good way =P).<br />10. Everything in general. This year has had it's low points, certainly, but overall it's been really good.<br /><br />11. Edit!: Why did I not write anything about Obama becoming president? Anyways..totally awesome, I've never felt better about America then I did on November 4th. :)"

I've never really put a lot of thought into it or been much a news watcher. I always knew I should, and felt sort of guilty when I didn't, but all the same. Of course I remember the last two elections pretty clearly and even have vague memories of the second time Clinton was elected (I think I had to color a map for school, haha). I couldn't participate in them though and didn't really understand all the details, so they weren't very important. I rooted for the democrats, especially in the last election, because I knew enough to know I didn't really like Bush and that he wasn't really doing much. But I digress. The point is, I didn't even care that much about this&nbsp;election. I cared a little more because I could caucus and vote, but I still didn't pay as much attention as I probably should have. And though I had been for Obama the whole time and I was glad to see him leading the polls, even up until yesterday I was only mildly interested.<br /><br />Then last night I watched the election coverage.<br /><br />I watched the different crowds of people waiting in suspense, I heard about the record number of voters, I watched the number of electoral votes coming in rise. And it all sort of hit me at once--I was literally watching history happen. It really hit home the idea of democracy, the idea that all of us, as the population of this country, have the lucky and admirable ability to be able to choose. All it takes is a big enough group of us working together and deciding together and we can radically change the way our country is run. It is so refreshing and inspiring to see that we're all ready for something to change and that we're willing to take a chance to make it happen. And I can now honestly say that I'm interested in politics, that I care about who is running this country that I'm living in. I can also say that, as horribly cheesy and cliche as it sounds, I'm actually proud to be an American right now. I'm proud that we all stood up and made a difference. I'm proud that other nations are looking at us with hope, instead of disdain. I'm so glad that I got to be a part of this.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />And that was my long political ramble. I tend to get excited about things and then I have trouble not thinking about them even when no one else really cares so then I have to ramble.<br /><br />School is eating me. Let's see...test, assignment, project, test, project, test. That's what my next two and half weeks look like. There's probably some more crap thrown in there that I'm forgetting.<br /><br />So, with that, I'm going to go clean and study graphic design slides and make typography squares.<br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

I love looking at it and learning about it and making it and watching other people make it. I love the feeling I get when I look at stuff I love. I think it's interesting how different people are, how much our interests differ. I think it's interesting that I look at a nicely made poster or a different font or a sketch drawing and feel inspired and awed and curious, while others might pass these things by without a thought. I love art studios, they are so relaxing and have such a positive atmosphere. I love looking at what everyone makes and how each piece is so different from the next, because everyone has different thoughts and ideas and ways of figuring things out. I'm so glad I picked this as my major, I really can't imagine doing anything else.

Typography..is going pretty well. I need to color my giant design. And color tiny color ones. Speaking of which, I need to go the CoD tomorrow to copy off baby ones. (I called them baby in class today and the girl next to me thought it was really funny.)

Graphics class is kind of intense. I was all excited about gradient meshes..and now I'm all not excited. I have no idea how I'm going to make my camera. It will take 55849705843 hours.

Lecture is boring. So is art history. I kind of like the stuff we learn in art history..it just takes too long, and I'd rather hear about it casually then be forced to remember it. Econ..I keep skipping. I went to the TA session today though. Even though it was half an hour long and pretty pointless. But I think if I read a little and do some practice problems, that class won't be a problem.

I'm feeling pretty upbeat about my class projects right now. Well, actually I'm a little neutral about the photography one..but it's not super hard, so no worries. But my logo is good and I'm excited to start the rendering project even though I'm sure it'll be hardddd. And my text blocks are coming together, I think. I guess my professor will tell me if they are or not tomorrow.

The weekend was good. Not long enough, even though it was longer then normal. Friday Brandon and I looked for a party..unsuccessfully. It's not surprising we were unsuccessful, since we didn't have a destination. But we wandered through campus town. Saturday we went downtown and shopped around. Then I kind of felt like I was going to die so we went home and I passed out for a couple hours. When I got up I was still super tired and shaky and just..weird. Ick. Thennn..laundry. And Target. And dinner. And a really bad movie. Sunday I went to Des Moines with my friends, that was fun. I love shopping. I really love Forever 21, it's kind of ridiculous.

I think I've been thinking about writing in here for a few days now but never had the chance. So, of course, now I won't be able to remember anything I wanted to write about. But not really.

My dorm is lovely. Ok, at this precise moment it's kind of a mess. But it will be lovely. It just needs the christmas lights and posters and to be cleaner. And then it will be all cozy and cute. Yeah, I'm excited to be back at school. It's good to see everyone here and to just feel sort of at ease. I'm in such a different place then last year. I'm comfortable and fairly confident and happy, instead of panicky and confused. I'm pretty sure that I'm not going to want this year to end..everything is going to be different next year. Oh well, live in the moment, right?

The concert last night was cool. It wasn't the best ever but still good. Sara Barielles' performance was not as awesome as I hoped but that doesn't make her less awesome. The acoustics in the venue were weird and the crowd didn't care about her, so it was very lack luster. She could probably use a little more stage presence but she's fairly new. Her voice is amazinggg. I hadn't listened to a lot of her CD before yesterday and now I love it. I kind of just love her, haha.

I know I say this frequently but I love my family. It's always good to see my sisters, since none of us live in the same state anymore. My mom and I actually get along better (we never fight, really, I can't really explain it, but whatever) when I'm going to leave soon and she's sad about that. Which sounds really sad but it's not.

(By the way..big bowl, futon, wire shelves, glow stars..)

I have to go get copies of my car key made since one of my car keys mysteriously disappeared. And then tomorrow I have to go to the bank (because hopefully I'll get another paycheck at work today) and get money and promptly give most of it to my father because I owe him. -sigh-

Speaking of work, I think I'm glad today is my last day. Well, sort of, unless I work at Christmas time and such. But my last day for awhile. It's been a good job but I'm not going to mind not going. I'm a little bummed because I don't think anyone will be there today so I won't get to say bye to anyone.

Ok, I'm off to Wal-Mart. Because apparently that's a good place to get key copies made. And I'm going to get more purple yarn. And maybe that big bowl and/or glow stars I was talking about? Cha."

How did I forget about this Counting Crows song? Such a good song! It's funny that I only remembered it because I was cleaning my room and I found an old school planner and flipping through it I saw the lyrics. <I>""I want the ocean to cover over me, I want to sink slowly without getting wet. Maybe someday I won't be so lonely and I'll walk on water every chance I get!""</i> (Oh, wow, I just got really excited to see them again in a couple weeks.

Irish Fest last weekend..pretty good. Kind of hectic or something. But I love my family, so it's always good to see them. :)

Two weeks until school. Crazyyy. I feel like I'm going to forget stuff that I need or want to do. I should make a list. Or fix the little list I made.

I'm not writing the good sized paragraphs I have been, I guess I just don't have as much to say.

I'm lovingggg Breaking Dawn. It kind of seems like everyone and their mom hates it..but I just don't. I realize that it's not profound reading, not a literary masterpiece or anything. But it's /so/ good! I want to be a vampire, haha.

The second Traveling Pants movie was pretty good. Not as good as the first and not nearly as good as the books. But still good. A couple parts of it hit me kind of hard, I guess. I'm an emotional lady.

I'm actually getting good at my job, which is sort of pointless since I only have a few weeks left. But I really like it there, so I hope they let me come back on breaks and stuff. Of course, part of what has me saying that I'm good at my job is that I finally know where everything is and what all we have and such..and by the time I come back for whatever break, that will all have changed. Oh well. We're all friends and it's just a nice atmosphere.

I can't wait to move into my dorm room. It's not that I want summer to end or anything..I just really want to arrange my room. And not live with my parents. Yay for being able to do what I want, when I want. (And for having a warm, cuddly boyfriend to sleep next to. Haha, oops.)

But anyway, on the subject of my room. I got a new comforter, it's pretty and should go well enough with the sheets I have. I got plates and bowls for super cheap at Goodwill. I still need cups and silverware. I want a bedside table with a drawer..I think I'm going to go back to Goodwill and look. And while I'm out there I can go to K-Mart and look for the cups and such. I need a fridge. And some of those stacking cubes Ping and I had, or something similar. jfiodpajfopdaf I want to move in!

I'm crocheting a blanket. In theory. If you know me, you know I rarely finish projects. Ever. But I'm determined. And I'll make sure I keep it around and all the yarn and my hook together and everything so that when the urge strikes me, it'll be easy to pick up and work on.

I'm also learning how to play guitar. I'm pretty much really bad at it, but whatever. I lack the attention span necessary to be good at it. I'll keep trying though, it's fun.

Oh, and on a sad end note..I got another snail. And it died. I'm a snail killer. He was so cute and tough looking 'cause he was all black. I was calling him Monsieur. But no, no snail for me. (I think Boots wants his bowl all to himself. I don't know how he'd kill a snail, but still..)

I'm totally learning how to play guitar, via Brandon. I'm learning..very slowly. Partially 'cause I started learning and then didn't touch my guitar for like 4 weeks. But I just practiced for awhile. I don't know that I'm dexterous enough to handle it but we'll see. (You know what I love? Being able to right click on a word and have my computer tell me how to spell it correctly. It's lovely.)

4 weeks left of summer. Last weekend I was very ready for summer to be over, but I've settled now. I'm good with 4 weeks, I know it's going to go fast, this whole summer has, really. I feel like there's a lot of things I should do before school starts..I should probably make a list or something. I think this semester is going to be intense, I'll probably have a lot of projects, all the time. I have to make a firm stand on time management..my stand being that I need to partake in it.

Anyways, I should probably go to bed, tomorrow (er..today) is going to be busy, I think.

This weekend was fun, let's see.

Friday we all went to Hinsdale and got dressed up and went to this nice restaurant for the rehearsal dinner. It was a little weird that my family was there, because none of us but Jen were in the wedding. But we figured it was because of Jen and because we were from out of town. So we didn't really know a lot of people there, because a lot of them were Mike's family and friends, but it was ok. Awkward to start, but it got better. The people at our table (Sara and me, the rest of us were split up) were nice. Everyone sang Carly happy birthday and we made her skip around the room, Pennellwood style. Then our table made bite her giant piece of cake.

Saturday morning we went to the wedding and it was very nice. It was in a big, pretty church. I (and my sisters, too) was a little out of the loop at parts..having not been raised religiously, we didn't always know what to say and didn't know to cross ourselves and stuff, whoops. But the ceremony was pretty and seeing them give their vows and kiss made me a little teary. They looked so happy (and kind of like they stepped out of a magazine or something).

Saturday night was the reception. It was a lot of fun..I've never really been to a wedding like that, but I was having serious catering flashbacks. Dinner wasn't the most delicious, but I'm picky. The speeches were all cute, toasting is fun. My uncle Ray's speech was so cute, and then they had Mr. Sullivan play an acoustic song while they had their father/daughter dance. Pretty much made everyone (at least everyone in the family) cry, aw. And Diane and Mike's first dance was very sweet too, I loved the song they chose. (It was a Michael Buble song, who I never really have listened to, so I had to look it up when I got home.) Then we all danced all night, which was quite entertaining. The party apparently continued long after the official reception, but I quit while I was ahead and went back to my room. 

Anyway, I feel like I left stuff out, but that's the gist. I'm tired of typing now."

I work (a little), I sleep, I read, I spend time with my friends and with Brandon. All the days are blending together in a satisfying sort of way. For the most part there is a nice balance of busyness and laziness. I've cultivated a charming sleeping pattern of 2 am to 10-11 am. (But it's worth it to spend an hour sleeping where I'd really like to be, only to get up and come home and sleep in my own bed.) I get headaches too often, but I'm not sure what the cause is. The flood almost got us, but then it didn't. I find natural disasters very fascinating. Of course, that fascination has fully run its course after a week, and now I just the water would go away. Is it bad that I wish I could see what would have happened if it did go over the levee? It would have been a huge mess and a pain and put me out of a job for awhile, but I'm curious anyways. I want to spend more time in the sun. I should be outside right now. I really want to go swimming, which is unusual for me. I'm looking forward to Pennellwood, even though it's not for awhile yet. And it's not really Pennellwood, and will probably be weird and we might get kicked out. I wish I had my new design software right now. Even though I haven't been able to finish a graphic to save my life for months now. Bad sign? Perhaps. But I'm still excited for school. Not that I want the summer to go any faster, I'm just saying. I'm completely ignoring proper paragraph usage right now. Who needs it? This is mostly for my own catharsis, I doubt that anyone will read it anyways, and that's ok. :)  I want to draw. I've been wanting to. I should. Except that I do it and then realize that I'm not that good at it, which is a bummer. I need a good picture of a person to draw. I'll go look."

So, concert highlights..

-I forgot that Phantom Planet played the OC song, haha. I /knew/ I knew their name from somewhere. But they were pretty good overall, I enjoyed them.
-Admittedly I watched the backstage more then I actually watched Phantom Planet. I saw all of The Hush Sound putting on silly hats and masks to come on stage with PP. I saw Ryan and Brendon hanging out, Ryan also came on stage.
-The Hush Sound were good, but not as awesome as I was anticipating. I kind of want to be Greta though, she's pretty awesome. She's so cute and together looking and she has a wonderful voice.
-Motion City Soundtrack were amazing. I was really impressed. They were fun and full of energy. The audience knew all the words and sung along loudly, which is my favorite. 'Everything Is Alright' was probably the best song, though I had fun jumping up and down during 'It Had To Be You'. I just loved them. <3
-Panic At The Disco were pretty amazing also. I've loved them for a long time now though, haha. Sadly some extra pushy people stole our good spots, so seeing was an issue. Even so I was impressed, they sounded really good and they talked to the audience and were just nice. I loved Northern Downpour and Pas De Chavel. Especially Pas De Chavel, what a good song. Plus Randi was awesome and let me have her good spot during that song because I was so excited for it.
- (singing) ""..the poor grooms bride is a whore"" (Brendon talking) ""God, I hope so."" 
- ""That was the 600,000th time we've sung that song. I hope you feel special.""
- (girl in the audience) ""Marry me, Brendon!"" (Brendon) ""Sorry, I'm not ready for a commitment just yet.""
- ""Sing along if you know the words. If you don't..well..sing along anyways, we're putting the words on the screen.""

The last couple weeks of school were crazy..the last few days were even crazier. My portfolio took 4342432 years, let's hope it's worth it. And then packing took 2343 more years (less time..I mean, it really boils down to a day an a half, where as the portfolio was many days).  But now I'm home.

Maybe getting a job on Main Street. I'm not sure how sweet a deal this is, per say. On one hand, nice area, nice store, don't have to work late or on Sundays. On the other hand, less then minimum wage, only like 12-15 hours a week, and a small store so it's hard to be 'anonymous' or whatever. But if I get it I don't want to turn it down because I don't know if any of the other places will call..I actually sort of have my doubts. So..yes.

I'm not used to having copious amounts of free time. I like it though. I spent a good chunk of my afternoon yesterday just sitting by the river, and I have no reason to feel bad about 'wasting' that time. And I slept till 11 today and I don't feel bad about that, either.

I think I'll have a job at Twin Oaks. Ok, that's being way to confident. I have an interview there on the Tuesday after I get home and I'm really hoping they give me a job. 'Cause unless Vintage Iron magically wants to interview/hire me too, I'm sort of S.O.L. Hmm.

I have a lot of things I want to buy. This probably isn't good. Oh! Like a Format t-shirt, since I'm never going to see them live now. I just have to decide which one is most awesome.

Anyway, I've talked a pretty long time now. Tonight I need to..work on my 102 drawing, study?, take pictures for my portfolio, edit all the pictures I take/have taken. If I get all that done it will be wonderful. Then let's see..


Wed - Get a few pages done. Start essay?
Thurs - Write a big chunk, if not all of, essay. Draw.
Fri - Go take/print pictures. Cut out. Make some pages if you have time? (Buy tape!)
Sat - Hang out.
Sun - Draw draw draw. Make more pages if you have time. No, you don't have time, study! Shit.

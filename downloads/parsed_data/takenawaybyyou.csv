"event","<lj-cut text=""this is me whining about myself""> 

i just feel like letting somethings out

im screwing up big time. I fuck up at school and wait until the last minute to do my work. Dont get me wrong i love learning but i just cannot do work, specially if im at home. Im tooo freakin lazy. I have tried to change but i just cant, itll only last days. I dont know what to do. this really makes me feel bad and logically im harming myself. I need to get outof humanitas i just know i wont make it. I wanna graduate next year and just go to the Navy already. I think thats the best thing for me, i need discipline, i need organization inflicted on me. High school was my down fall, i used to do all my hw in middle school. i had As and Bs.Now i just look at them(my grades) and think i could have never gotten accepted by a good university. 

ive noticed that im really irrational and too much of an idealist. I rely on my senses more than on the truth and reason. But then again i cant rely on that either because most of the times what i think is the truth is not at all, Or my reason. my intuition leads me to believe things and i persue them as to be truth. I jump to conclusions too soon. All of this makes me think that im a bad person and im so damn fragile because ive got things all wrong. Locke said that knowledge of the world could only be gained first by the senses. But still you cant rely on it everytime it happens you cant make aumptions on your feelings. Im driven by my feelings, they control me,  my feelings are my ideas.  I cant change who i am. I cant hide or exchange my feelings for rationalism. Hopefully this is just a stage in my out of lesson years. If  i continue to be this way im afarid ill become a failure. Cause and effect. Ill never become what i want to be and that really worries me ."

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""i feel like writing..sorry if i bore you""> </P>
<P>i havent written in this shit in like forever. Its not even workin all i get are borders in my friends page. Anyways this weekend sucked ass. i think the highlight of my weekend was going to Sherrys house to work on a project. It sucks, you think a 17 year old would get more freedom, but once i turn 18 there wont be stoppin me. </P>
<P>I miss hanging out with my friends. I miss Bean and Jessica and Denise ,&lt;~~~ even though i see her everyday, but only for like an hour. I was so used to spending days with her during the summer. Man do people change and sometimes not for the best. </P>
<P>I cant wait for homecoming&nbsp;&nbsp;its MArdi Gra theme. Cant wait to get all dolled up tehee. I love going to football games, but people have&nbsp;their ways of killing&nbsp;them with their drama,&nbsp;band drama....&nbsp;Im in the flag team slash drill team slash color guard slash whatever else it is. Anyways were suppose to go to competition for some face off. ha its the funniest shit ever. I woudlnt doubt me flakin on them, we are so terrible. so sloppy! Then they create their own drama, its fuckin lame. </P>
<P>I love my baby! Hes the sweetest most cutest boy ever. I wouldnt trade him for the world. Specially since he got his braces awww lol </P>
<P>Now i think i bored you enough. Ha and i doubt&nbsp;anybody read this shit.&nbsp;Hopefully ill update&nbsp;another day with pics.</P>
<P>LAter Days!&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>"

<P><lj-cut text=""a letter from a very wise person ""> </P>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=1>Dear Sinthia,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=1>You know that I'm biased, in two ways.&nbsp; First I believe education offers more opportunity.&nbsp; You can literally shape your life by working hard in college.&nbsp; And, secondly, I am afraid when my dearest students such as you, join a military branch while there is a war in process.&nbsp; I don't know what part the Navy plays in the war, but I do not believe the world is calming down.&nbsp; I think there will be many more conflicts world-wide.&nbsp; I don't want you to be part of that. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOWEVER, if you feel a calling to serve your country in that way, I can't argue.&nbsp; Just be sure you understand what you will be asked to do.&nbsp; And don't believe that you will be able to obtain a college education while in the military.&nbsp; They will train you in some jobs.&nbsp; M***** P**** joined the army and learned about running purchasing and acquisitions.&nbsp; She's happy with it.&nbsp; And another student, an AP student has spent many happy years in the Navy.&nbsp; Another, however, sort of regrets not going to college.&nbsp; He has seen the world, but he has limited himself in other ways.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't make the decisions based on ""what elese do i have going for me?""&nbsp; That's just not true.&nbsp; You are a bright young woman who has not yet used her gifts.&nbsp; You have limited yourself thus far, but you needn't do that any more.&nbsp; The military is filled with kids from low-income families.&nbsp; Why do you think that is?&nbsp; Who will you be with in the Navy?&nbsp; Who will you be with in college?&nbsp; What do you want to do for the next 40 years?&nbsp; My brother went into airforce ROTC, graduated San Jose State, and served 20 years as an OFFICER, before retiring.&nbsp; But there was no war.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Military gives discipline and direction to those who lack it.&nbsp; College provides an opportunity for education and self-knowledge to those who will work at it and are not afraid to pursue this.&nbsp; What do you need now?&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think you haven't begun to know what you are about.&nbsp; But I also don't know what your home situation is and whether the military seems like a way to escape.&nbsp; But war, Sinthia, war.&nbsp; You can always join the military -- why not give college a try.&nbsp; Work hard next year (in Humanitas, with Polit -- what's wrong with that boy?) and go on to a community college and on to graduation.&nbsp; But as I said, I'm biased.&nbsp; I cherish my education -- but then, maybe I could say of that, ""what else do I have going for me?""&nbsp; The difference is I'm old and know myself, and you're young, and have no idea what you can do.&nbsp; Follow your heart!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=1>Thanks for asking -- write again.</FONT></DIV>

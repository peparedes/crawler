Me,Lauren,Kate,Emily,Chrissy,Ashlea A,Ashley B and Julie B were singing with A LOT of excitment but we almost got in trouble cuz we sang a lil bit too loud haha. Anways, I only had 1 thing for homework but had to research some stuff 4 a project. I shoveled some snow and stayed out there and made a fort but it was tiny. I went online and talked for a bit. I was talkin to my brother's friend Joey and he said the next time we have a snowball fight, IM him to come over and he'll be on&nbsp;mine,my bros and my&nbsp;2 neighbors&nbsp;&nbsp;team cuz last time I had a snowball fight, I got hit in the face and he felt bad for me. OMG!!!! I wanna have a snowball fight soo badly. It's gonna snow A LOT this week so I'm hoping this weeek , we can have the snowball fight. I ate dinner then went back online. Just hangin round the house right now. My mom made cookies and I'm gonna eat sum soon. I can't wait!!!!Tomorrow is our concert and I'm in band and chorus. Well I'm gonna watch tv, go online, and go to bed sumtime.</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#33ccff><FONT size=2>Sorry I haven't but updating but also for another reason is that LJ had a huge power failure but now it's back up and running again. Today, I went to the city and saw a show called</FONT> <U>""</U><FONT size=2><U>Cookin""</U>. It was cool and funny. For dinner, we ate at a <FONT color=#33ccff>chinese restaurant and </FONT>the food there was really good. We also went in a few other stores. Then, we went to the bakery and I got hot chocolate and something else&nbsp;I don't remember but I know it was good&nbsp; lol. My brother got a deck of cards so we played ""Spit"" and 5 card poker. It was fun. We got home about 21 minutes ago. Last night I watched the Jets vs the&nbsp; Steelers game and <FONT color=#33ccff>unfortunately,</FONT> the Jets lost. NOOOO!!!! I'm very <FONT color=#33ccff>disappointed in </FONT>them lol. I hope the Steelers lose the next game lol. Anyway, I went to my friend Shannon M's house and came back around 2:00 AM. We watched <U>""The Village""</U> and it wasn't even scary. We played with their pet ferret Rascal. He's sooooooo cute. I watched a lil bit of tv when I got home and then finally fell asleep. Well, I think I'm gonna do stuff online, play games, watch tv and then finally at sometime, go to sleep.</FONT></FONT></P>

It wasn't so bad. After school, I came home and did homework and went online for a bit. For dinner, I had popcorn chicken with 2 other stuff. It was so yummy especially the chicken.

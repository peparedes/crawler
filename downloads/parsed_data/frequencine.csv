"event","I went to the Sprite Liquid Mix Tour last night featuring Jay-Z and 311.  I've seen 311 a couple times already and they're good every time; no problems with them.  Jay-Z comes on with his Jigga song which I thought was a good sign that this was going to be a great show.  Then, he starts bringing out all his homies to start rapping' shit that no one's heard before and start promoting their individual albums.  Jay-Z barely made it through 3 or 4 of his own songs before ending the show around 10:15pm!  What the hell is up with that shit?  He only went on at 9:30pm and didn't perform much of anything.  Let's just say I won't be going out of my way to see Jay-Z again."

The only reason I got up this early is because of the Sprite Liquid Mix tour featuring Jay-Z, 311, and a bunch of other bands and that starts at 3:30pm.  Now, that I think about it, I'm not missing much by getting up this early.  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"

"event","Well, here it is...

I was told by Jen that my assignment for today was to post a journal entry.  I've just about had it with assignments since last night was my last class of my Master's program.  That's it, no more school, ever.  

I'm off to Kentucky tonight and will get there by morning just in time for the Kentucky Oaks which is the sister race for the Derby which is on Saturday.  Most people go for the races, the horses, the Mint Juleps, the infield debauchery...you know why I'm going?  One word - Starship!  Oh yeah, we built this city on rock and roll!

The Islanders - Thanks to them for an incredible season.  Going to 3 home playoff wins was crazy.  If only they could've won 1 game in Toronto.  We probably would've if the Hanson brothers didn't dress up as Tucker, Corson, and Roberts.

So, is this enough to complete my assignment or should I talk about layers?  I believe I know 7 layers of Jen Smith...the sour cream, guacamole, rice, beans, tomatoes, lettuce,  and grounded beef.  Oh wait, that's Taco Bell's seven layers.  What I do know about Jen Smith is that she's a very good driver...  hehe  (Is it still Pick-On-Jen-Smith Day?)

See y'all when I get back from the races!"

My row of cubicles is having an indoor block party.  We're roping off the row and the company's providing lunch and we're all bringing an appetizer or dessert.  Someone's even bringing a hammock.  It starts at 12 and will most likely just go through lunch but knowing this group I wouldn't doubt if it went longer.  It's going to be a major distraction either way.

I guess I'll end up at the gym tonight.  No Isles game, no class, and the Mets game already happened.  Sounds like a gym night to me."

"event","Friday - Checked out Spatz, this new club that opened in the food court near work.  They have happy hours there and I guess it's a dance club at night.  There were a lot of hot chickies there but word will get out and then it'll be a sausage party within weeks.

Chillin'' at Ed & Kim's - Sitting around watching Goodfellas, Tom Green's Subway Monkey Show, and Revenge of the Nerds.  Very productive night in my book plus I got  to see Matt, Ed, and Kim which I haven't seen in awhile.  This will soon change as next week is Eddie's bachelor party.  May have to censor that journal entry.  Hehe...

Saturday - Saturday Morning Class - Possibly the worst concept ever.  We found out that our professor will be out the rest of the semester because of his health.  I really hope he gets better.  Great guy and professor.  Thinking of getting a card together from the rest of the class.  The sub let us leave around noon so Mat and I met Dave Cheng for lunch.  Then all of us played tennis with 2 rackets and a hockey stick.  Anybodycan play with a racket, but to play tennis with a hockey stick is a real challenge.  Then we threw big rocks into this big wall of earth.  It was pretty funny but I guess you had to be there.

Isles Get Into Playoffs - Unbelievable!!!  I have been waiting forever to go to a playoff game in my adult years.  My parents brought me to games as a kid but I'm pretty sure I was braindead until around age 4 or 5.  Anything before that I have to rely on home movies and my parents' word.  Would've went to Effin Gruven with Keith but he din't want to drive me back afterwards since he was half way home even though I drove the week before in a similar condition.  We have more arguments about who's driving then anything.

Sunday - Didn't even leave the house.  I overslept my Dek Hockey game at 10am.  That daylight savings thing killed me.  It was kinda boring not doing anything really but I wish I had that kind of day today.

Today - Brand new alarm clock makes me miss my doctor's appointment.  Oh well...  Currently trying to get somebody to go with me to see Parliament Funkadelic in the city tomorrow night.  My friends and I are into the movie PCU which we ritually watched in college.  In the movie Parliament Funkadelic plays the big party and I want to experience it myself."

"event","A brief description of your personality:

No worries, mon. Nothing phases you. You're a well-balanced, decent kind of person who likes to go along with the crowd. However, when the crowd does something you don't like, you've got the strength to take a pass. You're a great listener and have plenty of friends, but alas, you've heard the dreaded, ""Let's just be friends"" kiss-off one too many times. Perhaps you should consider becoming passionate about something, anything--it might do you some good.

OK, enough fanfare...

<Bold>Friday:</Bold>
Skyscape at CBGB's - really good stuff and that's coming from someone who didn't hear it 10 years ago

<Bold>Saturday:<Bold>
Isles beat the Wild - Don is happy

Sorority Boys - pretty funny movie

The car in the driveway incident between me and parental units - How come every argument that I have with them comes down to ""Move Out!"".  Time and time again I try to tell them I'm stuck at leats until May when I'm finished with my Master's and then I can figure out what I'm going to do after.  I don't want to move where I might not be within a year.  Know what I mean?  Believe me that's the only thing stopping me cause I need a place of my own.  I'll settle for my old dorm room again.  But then again, that's a room on the girls' floor now.  But then again, that could be interesting ;)

MTV Spring Break 2002 - this always give me a tingle in my stomach.   All that skin reminds me of summer and the beach.  

<Bold>Sunday:</Bold>
Back at the Gym - inspired by watching all the in shape bodies at Spring Break, I headed back to the gym for a push to lose a whole bunch of weight before summer.

Hockey Practice - went well except for the disagreement between me and the ""Captain"".  Maybe I'll just show up for games from now on..."

""You're a straight-shooter with strong-willed resolve. That's why Limp Bizkit's ""My Way"" is your theme song. When you're at your best, you're holding court at the local restaurant, or hitting the highway with friends for a road trip.""

It's not my favorite Limp Bizkit song but the desription fits.  And, as we all know Jen is sprung on the bizkit!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"

"event","Since people on here are getting all mushy on past boyfriends I figured I would give a rundown of the opposite sex in my life.  I'll try to go with the most recent and work my way back.  Feel free to scroll down and read in reverse.  I will use initials to protect the innocent.

ST - friend of my sister's who I went to one of her friend's weddings with but nothing really happened mainly because she's my sister's friend

DG - girl I met online and went to a Dave Matthews concert with but ended when she told me she was agnostic

CH - girl I met online and had a brief good time with but ended because she had no problem with seeing guys at the same time

JS - older gal who kinda picked me up at a bar who I had a good time with but ended due to the whole ""older"" thing

JH - best friend of one of my buddy's girlfriend's who I really liked a lot and kinda resembled Melissa-Joan Hart.  We had a good time one weekend but ended when she went back to her boyfriend

TW - quite possibly one of my biggest blown opportunities.  We had a couple of good times and she told me that she liked me but I never followed it up.  I'm still kicking myself for that one    

DB - theater major from Jersey that liked hockey I went out with once and hung out a couple of times but ended due to reasons unknown

Before that girls fell into two categories, friends and crushes.  My girl friends, you know who they are.  My big three crushes: MZ, SM, and HD.

Before college I have to admit I was very shy with the ladies so there's not much to tell."

"event","Friday - Dropped some major coin at the car dealership.  I picked up my new car and felt pretty shitty, feverish.  My family was excited for me but I couldn't get into it.  I went to bed early knowing I would have to get up early for a class on Saturday (yes, I said Saturday)

Saturday - Got up for class, feeling better.  Another class with Mat just like every other computer class we've ever taken.  I watched the first half of ""Rock Star"" trying to get psyched up for the Limp Bizkit audition on Monday.  The first half of the movie is pretty cool and had me looking forward to possibly getting the gig with all the hotel wreckin' fun that Marky Mark gets to enjoy.  Then, I went to the Islander game and left happy as they beat Tampa Bay 6-2 in overtime. (just kidding about the overtime part as that's impossible in hockey.)  I headed over to Kristi's ""Going to California"" party/get together.  Not wild enough to be considered a party.  I went by myself as both my candidates for driving partners bowed out (Jen and Keith you know who you are...).  Ended up driving some friends around in the new wheels with the top down at night in January...well worth it.  Nobody flashed this time around, will have to wait for warmer weather I guess.  I also continued talks with Kelly about getting an apartment.  No Truth or Dare Jenga this time around.  It's return will be soon, I promise.

Sunday - Psyched to get ready for my audition the next day; took the day off and everything.  Went out, got a haircut so I could look the part (nothing crazy just my usual 0A buzzer on the back and the sides and trim the top so it fades in with the back and sides.)  I then went to hockey practice to get ready for the upcoming season which should be pretty fun.  Come down and bring the whole family.  Meet our mascot, ""Peels"".  He's a gorilla but the team is ""Jackals"".  Go figure!  So after practice I'm tired as it's the most physical activity I've had in a while.  Had some food at the Outback and watched the rest of ""Rock Star"" which was kind of a downer cause well , you have to see the movie.  So any way I head home with intentions to figure out a solo along with some Limp Bizkit songs.

Monday - I didn't go to the audition.  The night before I couldn't find my Limp Bizkit cds and couldn't figure a good enough solo that would win myself into a million dollar band at 2am.  I also figured that there would be tons of players there whose favorite band was Limp Bizkit and knew every song.  I like their stuff and all but it's not the kind of stuff I usually play being more of the Juliana Hatfield/Weezer kinda guy I am.  Besides I would have had to wait around in the cold for hours to play for a minute and travel to Queens no less at 6am.  Too many factors working against me.  Oh well...  
Later on that day... my friend Catherine booked some time at a recording studio because a producer for an off-broadway play saw her singing a Janis Joplin song in a piano bar and said that she should try out for the part of the understudy for the main role.  We recorded ""Me and Bobby McGee"".  I was strumming her 12-string and of course she did the vocal part.  It came out really cool and I got one of the cds.  If you want to hear it, let me know.  

Tuesday - Went to work feeling like a moron cause I had to tell everybody that I didn't go through with the audition.  Most of them were looking forward to a good story or good news and I feel like I let them down.  I'm doing all right 'cause recording on Monday may have sparked my motivation to actually playing, writing, and recording on a regular basis again.  Still have to finish that ""All But A Memory"" song about the fast times at C.W. Post.  It was just a regular day: work and then an Islander game.  I felt like shit afterwards as it was a lackluster loss to the Devils.  Booo!

Wednesday - Work and school (recurring theme isn't it?)  Woke up on the wrong side of the bed feeling like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day going through the same dull routine everyday.  I got passed it though.  I washed my old car during lunch so it could be returned the next day.  I went to class which is pretty cool cause we get to make cool graphics on the computer.  During class I found out that Islanders were up 4-0 over the Rangers and Yashin got the Hat Trick (3 goals in a game) after the first period.  Don is happy once again.  I then meet up Jen, Nicole, Mat, and Cory (whose smile can make her worries melt away BTW).  It was cool and casual.  I ate some food, BS'd a little and went home to clean out my old car and watch the repeat of the game.

Today - The Mardi Gras bug is biting.  I'm thinking about going again since I had an awesome time last year and all the Super Bowl hype (which is in Nawlins this year) has got me itching.  I found airfare for $104 each way.  The only thing stopping me is the whole flying thing which I've never done before.  Anybody else wanna go?
BTW, I still haven't returned my car yet since the lease manager went home already so I guess it's going back tomorrow morning, oh well.

pretty busy week, eh?"

Now I'm definitely not going to get all sappy on how it's almost over because honestly I can't wait to finish school.  It's definitely not undergrad which I didn't want to end.  This is Master's.  This is working a full day at work and then 2 nights go to class for another 2 hours sometimes until 11pm.  Now on every other Saturday for half he semester I get to be in class from 9am to 3pm!  I don't even get up that early for work!  Yep, it sucks.  Will it be worth it? Probably.  Would I do it again?  Probably not, but that's what I said last time..."

My name is Don and I live on Long Island.  But if I know the crowd that is reading this, you probably knew that already.  So hopefully I'll be able to post some cool stories and maybe even bounce some ideas off this journal.  Feel free to respond with whatever.  I don't care.  I can take it.

Story of the Day:  I won an auction on Ebay for Finch's outfit from American Pie 2.  Very excited about this since A) I paid a very reasonable price for it (I guess everybody else was bidding on Nadia's bikini?) and B) Our good friend Maury looks and sometimes acts like Finch himself (Yell out ""Finch"" from across the room and he'll respond!)  It'll probably end up being his.  Maybe I'll see if anybody wants to chip in on it and give it to him as a b-day present or something.  If not, maybe I'll frame it or maybe just give it to him.  As a wiseman once said, ""It always comes back to you"".  We'll see...

There's something very Doogie Howser about all this..."

"event","i was once asked what my pet peaves were, and at that time i really didnt know what they were.  ive always been against dressing up animals, but other than that, i could not come up with anything big.  more than likely this is the result of my pleasant easy going personality.  not much can really bother me to the extent of becoming a ""pet-peave"".  this morning however, made me realize that i do have at least one other besides animals in clothing. 

my cousin was being a little bit of a recluse this morning, so jokingly i asked him what the heck his problem was.  his response was, "" i aint got no problem.""  wanting to believe that i turned around to leave his room when he mumbled, ""im kinda pissed i had to clean the kitchen by myself this morning, so dont talk to me!""  This got to me quickly!  Damn near instantly!  

theres 4 guys that live in this house, so as anyone would expect, its not sparkling clean!  there are usually dishes in the sink.  it happens.  its guys.  its college!  then i realized that he really does like to put blame on the people responsible for leaving the dishes in the sink, and somehow always manages to leave himself out of the list like he's never done it.  he tried to single me out as the main contributor, which is about the time i quit listening because at that moment it occured to me what my other pet peave was.  its people who make obliviously immature and ironical statements about others and what they do and dont do in the eyes of the person making the comment.  in english, i cant stand when immature people give their biased opinions on stupid things (ie: who washes the dishes most often). 

i like reason.  i like maturity.  i like importance.  if you cant give me something other than ""well i wash the dishes all the time, you never do!"" then i really dont think you should be priviledged enough to converse with me.  my life/time is too important to waste on stupid crap!

along with that previous example of my newly realized pet peave, if you are going to make a dumb comment and then spend the rest of the day not speaking to me, please dont think that you are winning some mental game with me.  you arent putting me through any mental anguish.  at least you arent running the risk of saying something else not worth listening to!  you may earn a small piece of respect from me by not continuing to show your ignorance!

anyways......  Robert Randolph and the Family Band are playing next week at Jupiter!  ill be there...."

I often get told, ""Brett, you need to get laid!"" Its getting rather old, and i think its about time i spoke my mind about it.  Have i had sex? Yes.  Has it been a while since the last time? Yes, years.  How many people? one.  Really? really.

thats usually how my conversations go.  heres the deal.  the last person i had sex with was my ex girlfriend.  its been about 3 years since we broke up.  i dont actively try to get laid.  why you might ask.  because its really not a big deal to me.  sure it was great, but there were so many other things about that relationship that were great, even greater, and now i look for those things in girls before i look at them and tell myself, ""man id like to__________ her!"" im not turned off to it, it just doesnt bother that its not happening, and i dont like to think of myself as someone who keeps track of his ""number"" like im in a competition for some cool trophy.

i think that pretty much explains it, but i have some more stuff that i just want to put down in words...

- i like art.  im just creative and i like it.  all kinds, especially funky photography.
- i think Amy Lee from Evanesence is hot. 
- i really want to write a book.  i think id like to write it about college, for high school seniors.
- id rather date someone i dont already know, cuz i think the fun is in getting to know them.
- im very sophisticated and i dont like being around people who arent.
- i dont take life to serious.

thats just some stuff.

theres something thats been bugging me for a while now.  im moving to birmingham soon and i want to be a bartender.  no i dont want to make bartending a career, but i think it would be something fun to do till my friend graduates in may and we can start out little business adventure.  bartenders make, on average, $60,000/year and thats working just a few times a week.  the money is not the only reason i think id enjoy it.  if you know me, then you know im a people person.  im never happier than when im around a bunch of cool and interesting people.  i want to use that job to save some money to back our business thing. 

our plan is to start flipping houses.  my friend, no names, has been a realtor since he was 19 and is very good at it and has a good mind for the real estate business.  i think with his real estate knowledge and marketing degree, combined with my level headedness, managed lifestyle, and management degree, that we can get this to work.  my problem is that the one person i need to be behind me in the decision, my mom, seems to think ill automatically fail.  shes always told me i can do anything i can set my mind to.  i finished college in 4 years, graduating cum laude.  ive got great business sense.  why now does she throw this roadblock in the mix.  how can i prove that this is something i can do.  sure i dont know everything about the industry, and i dont expect everything to go flawlessly, but thats the whole point of entreprenuership.  thats what i am.  thats my degree.  its hard to swallow the idea that my mom thinks ill fail...."

moving on, i havent figured out lately if im happy with my lack of being in a relationship.  i know i used to love being single, but now, i dont know.  i think i just miss feeling adored by someone other than those people who are supposed to adore you anyway (aka. family).  and by ""adored"" i dont mean by my large number of sexually crazed fans.  i want to feel wanted again.

I get hit up at least twice a day by people needing advice on what to do in a relationship, how to start conversation with people, what to do in this or that situation, yada yada.  I'm about 99% accurate and helpful too.  Its so funny.  I completely understand that whole ""those who cant do, teach"" thing now!  

<b>This is a statistic that i learned today:</b>
75% of guys who use the pick-up line ""Hi"" are successful.
100% of girls who use the pick-up line ""Hi"" are successful.

In light of this new discovery, i have a new business plan.  Nobody really knows this about me, but i write down new business ideas all the time.  Sometimes i even go as far as making blue prints of buildings, and things like that. 

My idea is a dating service.  Not a ""rent a girlfriend for the evening"" service.  You call this place, and tell them you want to do something special for your girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband, etc... and the company hooks you up with good reservations to the best restaurants, the option to rent a fancy sports car, or get a limo, even picking out clothes.  The date doctor, myself, will even go so far as to help give advice as to what to do to make it perfect.  I might even go as far as to use ear pieces so i can feed lines to people!

Its a million dollar idea!

i got some new news for my avid readers!  it looks like im going to be going to gradschool at samford next year.  not because of the girls though.  well, maybe a little!  alabama pretty much screwed me over and told me i could start gradschool in the spring, which i cant, because you cant start gradschool in the spring here at bama.  i dont know why the advisors told me i could!  while i was in bham friday i went over to the campus to see the girls and i decided id go talk to an advisor over there and see what their gradschool was like.  you can start gradschool at samford 5 different times during the year!  which is awesome because i can still apply for the fall semester there!  which is what im more than likely going to do.  im kinda excited about it though, because i know a lot of people there, and now i know a bunch of really cool, GOOD girls! and apparently im like one of the only guys they hang out with, so im already in!"

Day one of spring break started out awesome!  got up early and left the house by 9:30.  key success factor #1 of the trip was bringing the bullhorn along for the ride!  we made a couple friends even before we made it to Destin by yelling ROLL TIDE out the window as we all race 80 miles an hour down the interstate to the beach!  We got there right at 3:00pm, which is when our check-in time started.  Our friend Christy came over from tallahassee to check us in, and we had to pretend that she was our half-sister for the week.  Check in went easier than we expected.  Christy left right after she gave us the keys, but it was cool and we REALLY appreciated her coming all the way over to do that!  THANKS CHRISTY!

So, we werent there for more than an hour before we went to wal-mart and bought us some food for the week.  Food consisted of ham, turkey, cheese, pickles, mayo, mustard, break, milk, and cereal!  thats it!  the food took up about 1/5 of an empty shopping cart.  the beer on the other hand!  well that took up more than one shopping cart!  and was gone in about 3 days!

<img src=""http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b396/lifeofabamaguy/IMG_0725.jpg"">

It took us all of about an hour to make some friends.  The first people we met happened to be from Ohio.  They turned out to be awesome people, and friends that ill have for a lifetime.  They lived on the first floor of the condos, and were just great, down to earth people.  Needless to say, we had some good times teaching them about alabama!  The really funny thing is that they fell in love with the idea that we add the lyrics ROLL TIDE ROLL to Sweet Home Alabama.  They couldnt get enough of it!

They also taught us their chear:
<b>O-H</b>
<b>I-O</b>

The gist of the week goes kinda like this....wake, crack a beer, eat some lunch, crack some beerS!, lay out at the beach or pool, crack some more beers, eat dinner, crack even more beer, pass out!

<b>(this pretty much explains it! - and Dothan KNOWS how to funnel a beer!)</b>

In the middle of this daily process though, we managed to do some pretty dumb, humerous things!  Take for instance, Stuart and I bought a hula outfit at the store right next to our condo.  I found that it made for a pretty entertaining time around the pool.  Apparently everybody else driving down the road found it highly entertaining too, because people actually got out of their cars to take pictures with me!

If we werent wearing them by the pool, we wore them to the beach!

Probly the 3rd day we were down there is when we started meeting all kinds of cool people.  We found out that the girls next door to us went to Samford, and because of a mutual friend that we had in HOLLY JAYE, we all became good friends!

(left to right: Amy, Mary Ashley, Sarah Kate, Ann Elizabeth, Katy, Katy, and Mary-Blake)
<img src=""http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b396/lifeofabamaguy/IMG_0743.jpg"">
(im going to marry the first Katy!)

From these girls came some of the weeks best quotes:
<b>""ok, so can i say something real quick....His gums were inflamed!"" - Amy</b>

<b>""Get on top of me!(tugs on penis)"" - Sarah Kate</b>

<b>""I meant to drink that much. I didnt mean to get that drunk!"" - Sarah Kate</b>

<b>""I dont date meteorologists!"" - Ann Elizabeth</b>


On the fourth day, we met some guys that go to school with us, and we all had this fascination with the lady laying by the pool.  She was older, but she was hott!  So, having quite a few drinks in us, we had no problem starting up a conversation.  Turned out to be a good idea, because the lady turned out to be Joe Theisman's wife (QB for Washington Redskins)!  She had actually been laying there wanting to talk to us too because she wanted to request a song.  We had been playing loud music from the balcony all day and she requested 99 Problems!  that was awesome!  then she was nice enough to warrant a group picture!
<img src=""http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b396/lifeofabamaguy/IMG_0724.jpg"">
(the guy in the very front is Darren, he was from Ohio too, i just didnt have a picture with him in it for the earlier discussion about those people)

The rest of the week went by flawlessly!  We did nothing but eat, drink, and lay out by the beach.  The weather could not have been better!  Well, i guess it could have been a little warmer, but once you were out in it for a little bit, it got hot!
<img src=""http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b396/lifeofabamaguy/IMG_0733.jpg"">

When i was looking through my pictures, it wasnt hard to pick my favorite.  The story is simple too.  Derek had been drinking beer all day, and i think he might have had taco bell for dinner the night before.  Anyway, he was too lazy to go back to the condo to use the bathroom, and he didnt just have to pee or he would have got in the ocean.  So what did he do?  He walked up under one of the beach houses and sat on a hanging rail!  The picture looks like the best corona commercial ive ever seen!
<img src=""http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b396/lifeofabamaguy/IMG_0739.jpg"">

My second favorite picture came on one of the last days when the weather was a little chilly, forcing us to stay in the much too heated pool at the condo.  We drank so much beer that day and didnt get out of the pool for about 6 hours.  This little kid was swimming around which kinda made us feel bad, because we thought we were kinda taking up the whole pool, which we were, but apparently he didnt mind.  He introduced himself to us, and his name was Campbell.  He asked us if he could have our empty beer cans, so of course we said yes!  So ladies and gentlemen, i give you the first BEERAMID built by a 6 year old!

In order to keep our thursday night tradition of margarita drinking at el rincon, i went to the liquor store and dropped $100 on tequila, triple sec, sweet&sour mix, and vodka (for some of the girls).  We found out that the game ""Never Have I Ever"" is not easy to play when using margaritas instead of beer!  I think we made it around the table once before we were too drunk to play anymore!

Before we had margarita night though, KT Cress(the girl from ohio) went to the store and bought about $150 worth of food and her and Fauker cooked it all afternoon!  It might have been the best dinner ive had in a long time!  We had mac and cheese with ham, two types of pasta with shrimp, asparagus, green beans, and more.  It was fantastic!  It turned out that KT Cress's dad is the VP of Merill Lynch(sp?) so she could afford the food!

I know im forgetting a lot of what went on, so ill just quickly add some of the other key events!

-Some girl just walked into the room and showed us her boobs and asked for a beer! Im not lying! we didnt ask to see them!
-the girls across the street are in some of our classes and we didnt know it.
-an Irish Wake is a green drink consisting of about 4 types of rum including 151!
-you can win a basketball game by getting excellent goal-tending calls!
-I can basically sleep on any kind of surface!
-No matter where you go, Tennessee sucks!


This is by no means all that went on, im just kinda tired of writing and i dont have all my pictures yet.  So keep looking for random updates to this entry!"

"event","only two more classes till im on sping break!  the day couldnt be going any slower!

Im in the computer lab because i have no more dining dollars on my ACT card to spend at the ferguson center.  I guess im going to sit here till my next class at 11:00.  BORING!  

Ill be in Destin all of next week and i cant wait! i dont even care that the weather shows that its gunna rain a lot while im down there.  i dont care because i wont be here!  The one thing that is kinda pissing me off is that Stephen is being a bitch about going.  He says hes not a beach person and that all he would want to do is sleep during the day and party at night.  I told him that nobody cares what the hell he does.  We just want him to go with us.  My problem is that he wont give me a resolute answer.  He says he wants to, but he doesnt think he is.  I dont get it.  It causes a problem because he initially said he was going, and now he says hes not, in which we have to find an extra person who can dish out the $200/person for the room.  My mom is gunna be pissed considering she already reserved the room and the people going are basically just paying her.  Anyway, we'll see what happens...

I laid out by the pool yesterday to start workin on my tan and i ended up looking like a cherry popsicle today!  the shower i took this morning may have been the most painful thing ive done in a while!

So Olga left yesterday.  Second time in a year.  She may very well be the perfect person for me, but unless one of us moves closer to the other, its never going to happen.  I didnt go to the airport because i didnt want to see her leave.  

The is all...

anybody notice the weather over the past couple days!?  its been amazing.  the only thing prettier than a sunny, warm alabama day is a pretty alabama girl!  nothing else tops either of the two!

Ive anybody ever reads my away message and it says that im going to a bar for a bikini contest, please call me and tell me im stupid!  we went down to the Venue for the contest saturday night and it was ridiculously stupid.  there were 7 contestants and they went so far as to have a top 5, top 3, and a winner.  it was so dumb! and the girls were horrible!  not horrible as in ugly, or anything like that, but just horrible as in you could tell they would have rather been doing something else.  they just needed $1000 so they entered.  the good thing about the night was that melissa was the bartender, and she made us some GOOD drinks.  her friend Kortney hung out with me and Stuart and turned out to be completely opposite of what i had originally thought about her.  she was so down to earth and cool!  i liked it!  plus shes a redhead, and you all know how that ranks on my list!!!

I have some news concerning my graduation.   im not graduating in May anymore.  its not because i dont have enough credit hours or anything.  im finished with my degree.  but since im not going to grad school in the fall (im goin in the spring) i would have to be taken off my moms insurance once i graduated.  so im going to go to school this summer and pick up that computer science minor that i was going to try for this semester, but couldnt.  im actually kinda excited about it!  i get to buy season tickets for next year now!  woo hoo!!!  im still going to graduate about a year ahead of all my friends, so im down with that!

i also want a tattoo.  i want a cross, with a circle in the middle, with my dads portrait in the circle.  i want a saint christopher medalion hanging off the cross, and i want airplane propellers circling the outside of the entire thing.  its probly hard for you guys to imagine that, but i think it would look cool."

tonight was interesting.  i met a cousin that i didnt know existed until about 3 days ago.  shes my 5th cousin, which i guess still counts as a relative.  her name is stacy nicholas.  shes 20, i think.  maybe 19.  cant remember.  my uncle told me and derek (my 1st cousin who lives with us) that she was here, so we called her up yesterday, and she came over tonight.  really cool girl.  hopefully we will start hanging out on a regular basis.  shes on the dance team here at the university.  it was just kinda a weird moment meeting someone thats related to you that you didnt know about for 22 years.  

i worked out today.  its been about a week since the last time ive made it to the gym.  school has just swamped me lately.  it felt good to get in there and get some good reps out on the bench.  listening to loud screaming music on the ipod.  thinking about nothing but the 245 lb bar that could potentially come down on my throat.  i love it!  it wore me out though.  i came back home and crashed!  never fell asleep though, and i think its messed me up.  i  have a little bit of a headache right now, but its getting better.

i got to thinking today as i was driving around just looking at tuscaloosa about how bad i am when it comes to girls.  i realized that i am essentially clueless.  i also realized that this might not be a bad thing.  i think that when they notice that im clueless, and see how hard im trying, that they actually like it, and that it works for me.  i really have no clue why i came to this conclusion.  i guess i was bored, and my brain was numb from my GBA 490 test this morning."

"event","you know that saying, ""What doesnt kill us, only makes us stronger""?  well im about as strong as it gets, so just go ahead and kill me.  i cant do another funeral.  is God trying to strengthen me up for something huge by making me go to all these funerals?  my emotions are gone.  i feel empty.  

i watched Brad, Eric, and Adam today, and i wanted to cry.  i couldnt though.  i tried, but i couldnt.  my tears are all gone.  Lawson took the last of them.  i wanted to cry, because i sat there and looked at them with those helpless stares, and i realized at that moment that i was the only one in the church that knew exactly what they were going through.  Six years ago i sat where they were sitting.  I had the same empty expressions.  Im ok with talking about my dad to others now, but back then, i couldnt.  I watched people talk to them and actually say, 
""I know how you feel.""  That just made me mad.  I wanted to talk to him, but i didnt get the chance.  I wanted to tell him about what is to come, and how to handle things.  I wanted to tell him to watch out for the people that all of a sudden try to become your best friend.  Lord knows that happened way to often.  But above all, i just wanted to cry.  and i couldnt.

I will say this though.  I want three people to play Amazing Grace on the bag-pipes at my funeral.  If they dont, im gunna haunt all the peope on my LJ friends list!  

one of the pastors that spoke during the service (im episcopalian, so im not used to multiple preachers) spoke about the Soiux Indians and the fact that they dont have a word in their vocabulary for ""goodbye"".  They say ""see you at the house.""  The more i thought about it, the more i liked the ways it can be interpreted.  and so, im going to end this whining, yet emotionally helping entry with a simple goodbye, and say ""See you all at the house!"""

as i was looking around i would notice that people were staring at me.  then i realized they werent really staring at me.  they are looking through me.  i realized this because i realized i was doing the same thing.  i was staring in katies direction.  i wasnt really even looking at her because i cant tell you what she was doing.  all i know is that she was in the chair about 20 feet in front of me, staring back.  this class is going to be the end of us all!

i wonder how many girls that i catch staring at me on a daily basis are really just staring through me?

"event","Have you ever just stopped and thought about the group of people you hang out with on a daily/weekend party basis?  I did that last night as the living room got filled with a bunch of guys who didnt feel like going out on a saturday night, but didnt feel like sitting on their asses at home either.  The door opens, you recognize the voices coming from outside, but the first thing to come through the door is a case of beer, followed by two of your good friends that just dont want to hang out at their own houses.  I think you could make a horror film if you were to tape all the guys that sit around in our living room on a weekly basis and just talk s**t about everything, and everyone.  One of the reasons i like being a guy is because we can say things like:

<b>""I used to narrate soft-core porn."" - Stephen Burton</b>

<b>""I went looking for ass, and left.  And she was married."" - Stuart Lee</b>

<b>""I hate school bathrooms.  I have to use the handicap ones for the spacious room, and yet my feet still dangle."" - Me</b>

<b>""She's a very sweet girl, and I'm going to make her throw up!"" - Stuart</b>

<b>""I can see the news article now!  6 die has fart ignites cigarette and causes explosion."" - Stephen (ill explain this if anyone really wants to know)</b>


You just cant say things like that in a group full of girls.  Actually you could, if the girls happen to be the girls that live next door to us, and influence us to do a lot of the rather stupid things that we do.  The real sad thing is that i dont drink that much, so i have all the free time to remember all the stupid things that we say!

We also do stupid things too, not just say them.  For instance, Derek got a call from a friend last night and he told him that there was  factory on fire just down the road.  So what do 6 semi-intoxicated people do?  We all pile into one car and drive towards the scene of a fire where all the cops and firemen in tuscaloosa have gathered to keep people away!  Bunch of geniuses we are!"

Of course with my sense of humor, im never going to let her live that comment down!  Never have i been ""read"" so accurately, and had it put into words so eligantly.  it was obvious that some thought was put into it, which most of the time is what is left out when people try to ""read"" me like a book.  and no brittany, melanie, or liz, im not going to tell you who it is!  you wouldnt know her anyway."

Ive had a crush on her ever since i met her back in highschool.  She was recently dating a douchebag and broke up with him, well, because he was a douchebag.

"event","If you ever want to know where i am, at least this semester, at 9:30 in the morning on tuesdays and thursday im in the Ferguson Center eating breakfast.  I go there between classes to grab some food, and i always sit up against the windows.  I sit there because i like to people watch.  I got to thinking about all the people that go to school here and what percentage of them go out on the weekends.  I realized that everytime i go down to 4th and 23rd, i see the same people, no matter if i know them or not, i have begun to recognize the same customers.  I just watched people walk by today and wondered what they do on the weekends instead of go out to the bars.  If i had to guess, id say that 30% of the students hit the bars on the weekends.  That leaves 70% of the student body unaccounted for.  They all seemed quite happy as they walked to class.  I dont know why i thought about this today, its just been one of those weird days where you ponder weird things i guess.  

I got a good laugh in class today.  Theres this girl thats been in a lot of my business classes over the years, and ive always thought she was incredibly beautiful, probly because she is.  Today i over heard her talking to one of her friends about some guys, and i caught her saying ""Oh my God, he totally has a receding hairline!""  I dont know why i thought it was so funny, but it was.  The girl that Drew and I joked about asking out for the past two years has turned out to be a total superficial bitch!  Its great!  Hell, I have a receding hairline.  What are we supposed to do about that?  Poor guy never had a chance because of his own genetics!

So its been about 2 weeks since Lauren became single... ???"

"event","the party i went to last night at the girls house on 13th street was pretty fun.  i had to go buy the kegs, but thats not anything unusual.  when the first keg floated, i heard somebody ask who was 21 that could go get another one.  i didnt automatically just jump in and say i was, so i waited just a second.  then i saw all heads start to turn in my direction, and i noticed my friend jessica giving me this really sad look.  if she wasnt so damn good looking i would have probly not gone to the store, but i guess i have a weakness for pretty girls.  

have you ever met someone at a party that you thought was really interesting, but you never got their number, and then you spent the rest of the next day trying to find out how you could get a hold of her?  well i met this girl named Laura Brown last night, and she was one of the girls who kinda hung around in the background of the party that was goin on.  there was just something intriguing about her.  i dont know exactly what it is, but i want to see her again.  i dont even think shes on facebook, so i guess im SOL!  

i have got to stop sleeping till noon on the days that i dont have class.  i only go to class on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, but ive got to stop being so lazy on the other days.  i need to get back into my regular workout routine, and i definitely need to go get some food from the store so i can get back on my regular eating routine too!  i figure since i have all this free time that i can get back into great shape.

anyway, so far this semester ive met some really cool new people.  the girl thats from alaska that joined DZ is in one of my nutrition classes, and she sits directly in front of me.  she doesnt know that i know who she is though, and she doesnt recognize me.  things might get interesting in that class.  i cant wait!"

"event","For a few days now ive pondered the idea of getting on here and writing a short version of my life story.  Now i think i will get started.  I may even make a novel out of it and use chapters!

I was born on January 16, 1984 in Baltimore, Maryland.  I was born during the worst winter storm that the city had seen in over 100 years.  On the way to the hospital my mom said that the most handsome man she had ever seen in the nicest mercedez she had ever seen drove past her and gave her a wink.  When he got in front of her, she noticed that he had a personalized tag that read ""Brett.""  Thats where my middle name came from.  A car tag!  My first name, Donald, comes from my grandfather (mom's side).  

I lived in Baltimore till i was about 3 or 4, while my dad was doing his residency.  He was an OBGYN. He then moved the family to Atmore, Alabama.  We lived in the biggest house in the city!  I dont remember much about it, mainly because we only stayed there for 6 weeks!  Mom has told me stories about me getting lost in the house because it was so big.  Ive been told that one of the reasons we didnt stay longer than 6 weeks in Atmore is because in that period of time, our house was struck by lightning 3 times.  

When we left Atmore, we moved to Birmingham.  Dad was working at St. Vincent hospital and mom was a nurse at Montclaire Hospital.  She worked in the premature baby ward.  I went to school at St. Francis Xavier school over on Montclair road, close to Eastwood Mall.  It was catholic school is you couldnt figure that out by the name, and yes, i wore the blue khakis and white shirts!  I did my first communion, first confessional, and first confirmation at that church.  I only went there for 2 years though, K-1st.  If we would have stayed in Birmingham, i would have graduated from that St. Francis, cuz it went all the way to the 8th grade.  Then i would have gone to John Carroll.  Almost wish i would have. 

Dad took over the practice of a friend of his in Jasper.  The mans name was Whittington.  His family moved to Florida, but have since moved back to birmingham and are living in Greystone.  Lindsay Whittington, his daughter, is a good friend of mine.  Patrick Whittington, was just a little too weird for my liking.  We moved in the Whittingtons house, and surprising enough i got Lindsays bedroom, and it was pink.  It didnt stay that way long, but still, mom still picks on me for picking the pink room.  It had the best view though!

<b>UPDATE ---- Chapter 2</b>

The new house was bad ass!  It had a pool, and was surrounded by woods.  I remember days where i would just get up at around 7am and just wander off into the woods following the creek for miles.  I wouldnt come back till dark.  I think one of the most fun things i ever did at that house was the day me and my dad set minnow traps in the with the intentions of catching snakes.  I went down about 2 days after we set them out to find that we had at least 4 snakes in there.  I braught the trap back to the pool area where we let them go, and dad showed me the proper technique for catching them.  Boy that was fun! 

As soon as we got to Jasper, mom got me into playing soccer for the Park and Rec.  I played for St. Francis, but had never played for anybody other than the school.  Jim Wilson was my first coach, and i remember being on the ""orange"" team.  I dont think we had actually team names.  We just used colors back then.  Soccer is where i made my first friend, Whit Wilson.  We lived about 200 yards from each other if you walked through the woods, so we hung out a lot.  Whits mom, Janie, was an architect, and we used to build houses on her CAD programs.  We drew up the blue prints for a fort that we were going to build one day, and we built it out of scrap wood and trees that we cut down.  That son-of-a-bitch is still standing in his back yard!  It was even two stories!  It rocked!

I made a lot of friends that year.  Most of them i still have.  When you are in the second grade, everybody wants to meet the new guy.  Its not like high school where the new guy has to prove himself.  My second grade teacher was Mrs. Donaldson.  She was really cool.  I remember how she would play all kinds of patriotic songs on this piano that she had in her classroom.  Third grade was cool too.  I had Mrs. O'Barr.  She kept a pet snake.  We got to bring pets in one day for show and tell, so i brought this crawfish in that i had caught in the creek behind our house.  She liked it so she kept it in her aquarium that was in the classroom.  One day it got out somehow (im still pondering this too) and it wound up on a shelf in the library!  I got a good laugh out of that.  

5th grade was fun! We did this whole space project where our entire 5th grade class built this paper mache(sp?) space shuttle.  It took weeks to finish it, but when we were done, it had all kinds of stuff in it, even a couple computers.  I think we did it for some contest, cuz i remember reading that we won some big award for it.  Anyway, i think it might actually still be there.  It was there a few years ago when i went back for a visit. 

I was also picked to be part of the very first group of kids chosen to start the ""safety patrol!""  All we basically did was stand outside after school and guide traffic and make sure all the little kids (i say little cuz we were like 7 and we were the  cool older students at the time) didnt get run over!

Another sport i played for the Park and Rec was baseball.  I loved baseball almost as much as soccer.  I was pretty much as good at baseball as i was soccer, which was pretty good! im not gunna lie!  I remember that Joe Justice's team was the team to be on.  All the best players got to be on Joe's team.  Apparently he had some pull with the Rec and managed to always end up with the best players.  I made it to his team the second year i was in Jasper.  We were the Braves for many of the years.  Then we changed to the Marlins.  I made the All-Star team every year, and you can find one of our jerseys hanging over the bar in Ruby Tuesdays back in Jasper! I made the soccer All-Star team every year also, and we always went to Dothan to play, and we always made it to the final round where we had to play the dreaded Dothan Red team!  grrrrrrr.

<b> UPDATE ---- Chapter 3</b>

Ah middle school!  Maddox Middle School!  What more can i say.  All of your elementary school friends from other schools are in your classes.  Life is good.  HA!

Actually, middle school rocked!  My main objective for middle school was to get into Mrs. Scruggs media class every year in order to bypass having to take one of those babies home in the other classes.  Being in media class meant no babies!  I managed to make it all 3 years without having to deal with those things!  Another cool thing about middle school was that we got lockers!  Hell yeah lockers!  What better to get into a fight and have your english teacher get thrown into them while trying to break it up!  Ms. Key, i bet that hurt?  Are your glasses ok?  Do you need another toothpick to hold that one side together?  

Im going to skip 7th grade because, to me, it was rather boring.  Sixth grade and eighth grade seemed alot more fun for some reason.  Ill never forget the day that Ricky Oswald made some wrong remark in Mrs. Hudsons class and took off running down the hall.  What was even funnier was when Mrs. Hudson took off after him.  We saw them running past the door at least 3 times!  And what is even more funny is that she caught him!  

They had football in middle school but i didnt play.  I never did have much interest in the sport.  I dont know why.  I did, however, play tennis.  J.Brock, myself, Whit, Lawson, Bebo, Adam, Matt, and a few others comprised the guys team.  We were pretty good if i do say so myself.  Whit and I won a couple of tournaments on our off time from the school team.  We would practice at the yellow house at the top of our street every day.  The owners didnt care.  Or they didnt know we were there.  

8th grade was cool!  Mrs. Scruggs media class had some fun times!  It was basically comprised of all the students who were selected to be in her Honors English class.  I dont know why they even made that class.  It wasnt any different than the other english classes, and i think its same to assume that it was a lot easier!  The media class was fun too.  Except for the day that we got caught throwing Mrs. Scruggs apple around the room.  She didnt like us much that week.  And that week wasnt much fun!  

Summers were great before highschool.  Every summer Braden and I would go out to his lakehouse and spend at least, let me reiterate that, AT LEAST, 3 weeks out there at a time before coming back into town.  Seadoos, boats, skiing, kneeboard, wakeboarding, cliff diving, man those were the days.  Chasing fine ladies down the lake on seadoos and boats only to do something incredibly stupid once we caught up.  The song ""Redneck Yacht Club"" describes our summers on the lake to a ""T"".  

<b> HIGH SCHOOL!!!</b>

Going from big dog in the 8th grade, to freshman in highschool wasnt necessarily rough.  I had too many friends who had older siblings that were already in high school and i already knew most people there.  And as for most of the crap that the movies makes out to happen to freshman, it never happened.  The best thing about freshman year was soccer!  Man i missed not being able to play in the park and rec during middle school.  What made it even better is that the high school team had been waiting on me to get there too.  Like i said earlier, i was pretty good!  Coach Young was cool.  He was also the art teacher, so of course, i took art my freshman year.  You have to get in good with the coach right? There were some things about being a freshman that i didnt like though.  One being that my mom still had to drop me off at school.  But that was ok i guess.  Everybody likes my mom!  The single greatest thing about being in high school were the girls!  What was it about the transition from middle school to high school that change the girls so much.  Why did we care so much more about what they thought once we got to high school?  

Honors english, honors math, two foreign language classes, and thats it.  Thats all that seperated the honors degree seeking students from everybody else.  And to top it all off, i think the honors degree was a lot easier than the regular degree.  

I want to say that Coach Davis should get his own chapter in this half ass novel, but im going to try and squeeze him into just a large paragraph.  Coach Davis was a mythical creature.  He had a oneway telephone line to God in his office.  He would walk out to the practice field on days that it was raining and draw a square in the sky with his fingers, and the clouds would open up in that square, and it wouldnt rain on the practive field.  It would rain on the track, 4 feet away, but not on the field.  He drank turpintine.  It was to ""clear his system.""  He held the record for most wins by a single coach in the state of mississippi and alabama in football.  You wouldnt be caught dead wearing a hat around him either.  No way!  

The reason i joined the football team was because he decided to actually watch the soccer team practice one day, and i kicked the ball from the other side of midfield through the uprights on the other end.  He strolled down to the field where he told me i was playing the wrong sport.  By the end of the day my name was on the roster for the next year of football.  Position = PK.

Our football was bad ass.  It had a very Varsity Blues feel to it.  Except we had two badass QB's instead of one.  As the kicker, i didnt really get much credit, but that was cool, because i was already good friends with most of the players anyway.  I did however get a nickname.  One day Brett Elmore, a student and our football announcer for the radio called me Platinum Toe as i was running out on the field to do a kickoff.  The crowd cheered and the name stuck.  It didnt hurt that i wore my soccer cleats to kick with for football either, and they were bright blue and silver.  Anyway, football quickly became my life.  I started getting letters from big D-I schools like Michigan, Penn State, Notre Dame, LSU, Auburn(given a hell no too by the way), USC, and of course, Alabama! But this was my junior year and i still had another whole season to play.  I held (still do actually) the record for highest punt average in the state.  The one thing i missed though by playing football was hanging out at the games with my friends.  We had one crazy student section! 

<b>THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE</b>

Theres only one movie that ive ever seen that somewhat accurately portrays the emotions that a person feels when they get a knock on the door from a Police Officer that is there to tell them that someone you love has been in an accident.  Spring Break 2000 turned out to be the worst week of my life.  Dad was flying his plane down to see us at the hotel in Panama City.  The next thing that i can really remember is that there was someone in a Police Uniform at knocking on the door.  After that all i can remember is sitting on a beach chair surrounded by 10,000 college students having the time of their lives, and feeling completely and utterly alone.  I had questions that i couldnt ask.  I had no answers.  All i knew was that my life had suddenly changed.  and i cant write about this anymore....  

<b>THE GIRLFRIEND</b>

My junior year of high school we got a new football coach, not a head coach, but just another assistant coach.  he had 3 kids, one of which was in our class.  Her name was Stephanie.  To be completely honest, i dont even know what happened that led to us dating.  All i really remember is that she called me first, and then kept calling, and calling, and one day we were together.  We dated for almost 5 years. yeah i know! to be honest though, i cant say that i didnt enjoy them.  she ended up living at our house because her parents kicked her out of their house for reasons that had nothing to do with her.  her parents were crazy, and thats all im going to say about them.  her living with us was probably better for her than living with her own parents.  not for financial reasons, but more for mental stability reasons.  I dont want to write alot about her, not because she wasnt worth mentioning, but because i dont want anybody to get any bad impressions about her.  alot of people didnt like her, mainly because she was new, and immediately popular.  


SO BY THIST TIME IM A Freshman just entering school at alabama!

why do people feel the need to tell me that the girl i kissed on new years ""f---ed the hell out of so and so"" later that night.  is that supposed to make me feel better?  worse? what?

went to a party last night. it was ok i guess.  met some very attractive girls.  actually knew one of them.  knew another's older sister.  that was enough for small talk.  which is more than ive been getting lately.

im turning 22 on January 16th.  yeah.  wish there was someone that i could spend it with alone (and i dont mean it like it sounds).  i dont even think i want a party.  if someone throws me one thats cool, but i dont think ill be throwing myself one.  

i think im going to send an application for grad school to the University of Alaska Anchorage.  i miss it there.  i felt like i fit in better there because i was different.  everybody there was from somewhere else.  here i feel like im out of the circles.  one reason is because i dont try and sleep with everybody i meet.  apparently thats the cool thing to do around here, and i just dont fit that mold. im cool with that though, cuz the one person who likes me for that reason is the one person that im looking for.  

sorry this was depressing.  i guess im just a little worried that im gunna end up alone. i probly wont, but for now, thats how i feel."

stephanie is here.  dont get me wrong, i like seeing her.  but we havent been together in more than two years.  im glad she had a good christmas, cuz i know how her family is and i know the potential for her christmas to be bad.  however, theres just something in me that says i dont want her here anymore.  i dont want to sit around and listen to her talk to her boyfriend on the phone.  i dont want to here about how shes moving to north dakota cuz thats where he lives.  they have only been together for like 3 months. i think its silly and immature, but its not my decision.  right now she has taken over the tv with her 6 disc Oprah set she got from mom for christmas, which has pushed me over to the desk and this computer.  

having her here and listening to her talk to her boyfriend and all just makes me sad.  not because i still like her, but because im in my own home, im with my own family, and yet she still finds a way to take over.  i guess im jealous because i wish i could sit around and talk about my girlfriend all day, but to do that, id need a girlfriend.  it kinda makes me mad too, that shes moving.  mainly because mom has basically paid for her to go to UNA, and now she is basically just throwing it all away, cuz shes not going to graduate and i know she wont go back to school in ND. 

i guess im just lonely.  i miss tuscaloosa. im dying to get back. i also want to go to michigan and hang out with melanie, and all her EMU friends.  i had a great time last time i went and ever since, ive wanted to go back.  i also want to go to tyler, TX.  i want to go meet/hang out with Larkin.  shes a girl that ive talked to on the internet for the past few weeks.  she goes to alabama, ive just never met her.  i think Tyler, TX would make a great roadtrip too, and all of you who read my entries know how i like roadtrips!  

im going to go back to tuscaloosa tomorrow, because i got to put all my songs on my new iPod.  

man, is it mean that i just want stephanie to leave?  i have no bad feelings toward her, but i just dont want her to be here.  its driving me nuts.  im gunna go eat dinner now though.  later peeps!"

"event","Im gunna do some math here.  I believe that I have spent more time in the library these past two weeks than i have at my house. 

7 days = week
24 hours = 1 day

168 hours = 1 week

For the past 2 weeks ive been getting up at 8:00 and getting to the school by 9:00.  Now take out the time i was in class and that amounts to about 8 hours of classtime a week.  Plus 4 hours for the class ive already had this week.  so...

12 hours of class in the past 2 weeks.  

i get home at 10:00 everynight.  

so thats 11 hours everyday that im at my house. which is pretty much just sleeping.

55 hours a week just sleeping, plus 48 hours for saturday and sunday(although i was at the library last sunday, im still not gunna count it)

103 hours spent at home. plus the 12 hours im in class. = 115 hours of time spent outside the library.  so.....

168 - 115 = 53 hours spent in the library!  thats a whole 2.2 days spent in the library a week!  

thats fuckin nutts!!

see what its done to me! it has caused me to write stupid blogs like this one!"

"event","last night was great!

i have to 4 greatest neighbors anybody could ever ask for! I sat around at the girls house for hours last night, as they (and some of their friends) drank wine and ate cheese and crackers.  they got pretty tipsy.  tipsy enough to share all of their bad sexual experiences with me.  of course i was sober and thought it was great.  i completely dont mind being asked my opinions about stuff like that.  and i actually think they would have rather asked me then the other girls.  i actually felt like they enjoyed me being there, cuz when i left, they came and got me and brought me back.  apparently they werent through!  i heard things from ""being dropped on my head"" to ""its the prettiest one ive ever seen"".  the really great thing is that i now have all kinds of crap on them!  

i just felt like telling yall about my neighbors, cuz they rock!"

"event","im tired!

im in 4 classes, and that puts me in 4 groups.  ive had 4 group meetings this week.  i have a final in my product development class tomorrow that ive been studying for for the past couple days.  i have 3 presentations to do next week.  i have a 20 page paper do in two weeks.  the sad part is, the paper is gunna be the easy part.  somehow i have managed to let myself become the group leader in 3 out of the 4 groups im in.  i think i loaded myself down with too much work.  lucky for me though, im pretty good at winging presentations, and there's at least 1 that i can do that with.  

im more than likely going to Troy tomorrow afternoon.  Heather, from last year at the apartments, is having a birthday party and i havent seen her in almost a year, so i thought id be nice Brett and go down there. then friday ill be driving from Troy to Jasper to help mom set up the christmas tree!  

i also decided that over christmas im going to go back to Michigan to visit melanie again.  this time im gunna take Stephen Burton, if he wont be a baby and not worry about what his parents have to say about it.  i think it will be another fun trip.  this time it will be to Ypsilanti, not Detroit.  so maybe i can pick me up a nice East Michigan University sweatshirt or something.  i like getting college gear. its not that i have anything against staying in Jasper. I just really love road trips.  especially if someone goes with me.  

today has been interesting in the fact that i have run into at least 10 people that i havent seen in months on campus.  just random people that i dont normally hang out with, but i went to school with them and ive known them pretty much all of my life.  so its just been really cool. 

oh and by the way, i need a girlfriend.  heres my number in case anybody ""needs"" it - (205)522-4448"

"event","ok so we lost the game.  does it really matter?  We got 12 national championships, and auburn as none (or if you choose to count the ONE that they claim they have then - 1)!  

the trip to auburn started late.  mainly because stephen doesnt really travel, so he didnt really know what was going on with the traffic (ie: rush hour traffic in bham!)  it was cool though.  it was good to have somebody to travel with.  plus, when stephens around, you never really know whats going to happen.  you just know its gunna be funny and if you do end up in jail, hes gunna be sitting next to ya with the goofy ass grin saying, ""well, that wasnt the brightest thing we've ever done.  but he deserved it!  asshole!!""  

we got to auburn round 7:00 i guess.  it wasnt too late.  we ended up walkin up and down the streets with this megaphone i have making plenty of noise and just annoying anybody we could.  we ended up at John Murphys house.  then we ended up at his fraternity house.  it was a rather fun night.  i actually didnt drink either!  woo hoo!  

we stayed at stephen's cousins house, Lauren.  she is soo freakin amazing!  shes so OCD that it isnt funny.  and for some reason, i like it.  i have a huge crush on her and i dont know what to do about it.  i couldnt keep my eyes off of her!  shes beautiful, funny, smart, etc.. and i think i was afraid i would mess something up in her house too, so thats another reason! (and i hope stephen doesnt read this!  except he told me that i could date her if i wanted to.  none of his other friends could though)

FYI:  if youve never been to auburn, expect the worst laid out streets in the world.  the driving in auburn is ridiculous!  those stupid white street poles with the street names on them need to go.  you cant find a street to save your life!

i dont really have that much more to talk about so im gunna try and take a nap!  i know its 8:30pm but i think all i need is a nap right now.  i slept on the floor in laurens house so im deserving of a little nap!"

"event","i really need to work on updating this more often.  

well i went to brianna's wedding saturday.  it was a very nice wedding.  got to see a bunch of friends that i havent seen in a while.  it was the first semi-class reunion that wasnt at a funeral, which was nice for a change.

i wish the weather would make up its mind.  all this cold-hot crap is letting my nose kick my ass!  

ive been wanting to take another big trip to somewhere in the US that ive never been before.  i dont know why i have this urge to leave here.  its like im trying to build a resume that says that im well traveled.  i guess its something worth noting.  what im really wanting to do though is get a couple of friends together and rent a villa on the coast of jamaica or the bahamas over spring break.  i got to looking at them and they arent that expensive.  you basically get to live in a mansion on the beach for a week.  even have your food catered!  i dont think that $500 a person is that bad of a deal for a 6 night stay anywhere like that!  if anybody wants to do this, or is interested in it, lemme know.  

so i really need to start working out more often.  i havent really had much time to make it to the gym though.  i guess i could go right now, but i just dont like going to the gym at night.  id rather go at 6AM.  

got to talkin to a friend of mine today about a problem with her and her bf's relationship.  granted it is a problem, all i could think about is how i wish i was even in a relationship to have problems.  i dont know what it is.  i meet girls everyday.  is it possible to automatically know that a relationship between two people wont work.  i meet these girls all the time that are really cool and everything, but i just ""know"" that they arent the right ones for me.  whats my deal?

anyways, i think im gunna go get some milk.  im thirsty.  lata!"

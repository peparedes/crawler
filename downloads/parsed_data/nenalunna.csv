"event","My ex asked this morning if he can have our daughter baptized.  She was dedicated to each of our religions when she was a baby (he is protestant and i'm pagan/wiccan).  i'm not sure how i feel about his request.  No, i know exactly how i feel about his request but i need to explore it and come up with solid, unarguable reasons against it. 

The one person around right now that i tried to talk to says she thinks i should allow my daughter to ""embrace the christian religion and let her make her own choice when she gets older"", i almost puked at that comment and promptly stopped talking to her about it. But trying to have a serious conversation with her is a whole other story. i should have posted all the drama i had with her last fall here, it would have been fun to read it again. *L* (or did i and just don't remember?)

i think my reason for not wanting her to be baptized is because it will send her a message of ""this is who you are"". i don't have a problem with her learning the religion or even going to church on occasion, but i don't want her to BE christian. If she chooses that path when she is an adult and can make an informed, mature decision, i will be happy for her that she found something that fits her beliefs.  But since she is only just turning 10, the message will be that of a child trying to figure out where she fits in the world. It would influence how she thinks she should behave, the decisions she makes, even the words she uses. And i'm not over analyzing that. 

More than likely what is going to happen is that she will be baptized and i will have to talk to her more about my religion in order to counter-balance her theological influences.  The problem with that is i don't follow any particular set path.  i just do what is right for me and i don't feel i have anything other than that to pass on to her. Guess it's time to start exploring my beliefs again. Could it be that is the ultimate conflict i have? That this will cause me to study my own religion when i had finally come to terms with the way i 'practice' it? Ok, that just going to get too deep and we don't need to go there on too little sleep this week. LOL"

"event","i came in cuz i'm bored and not ready to go to bed and decided i'd see what leggylady might have written today, because she is such a faithful member and i knew she would have written something.  And my step-son, who is laying on the couch behind me says ""is that LJ? you should add me"".  So i get nosy and go into his LJ and leave a comment on one of his posts... then i come over to my own LJ and read some of my own posts... all i have to say is 

J, STOP READING NOW BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT TOO MUCH INFO!!

There, you have been warned and if you continue to read, well, they are your own nightmares. LMAO 

Honestly, i don't care much, but you seriously don't want to read any further. It has to do with parents don't have sex and stuff like that."

*deep breath* that felt so good, even if it wasn't an RT scream.

In San Jose, if you don't drive at least 70 on the freeway (and some surface streets) you'll get run over.  Around here, if you even try to drive the speed limit (65), you're going to hit someone! It drives me absolutely batty! 

i wanna go home early today but a friend is having trouble with his girlfriends (yes, plural). *sigh* Why couldn't he have had this issue earlier in the day? *L* At least they are VT g/fs and i can just remind him that his loyalties are with his RT wife and he needs to just get over it. *L*  That would be mean. *giggling* i totally understand what he's going through, and what the g/fs are going through... but i wanna go hoooome! *whines*

Damn it LeggyLady, this is two posts in one day, what have you gotten me into???? *grins*

So now i sit waiting for my friend to get back on Yahoo so i can talk him through this and i have nothing to do for i don't know how long and i'm just waiting and waiting and waiting.... on the other hand, why are you still reading this?"

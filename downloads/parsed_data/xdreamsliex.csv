"event","so got back from wixom a lil bit ago.  went to watch luker's bro play and there you have it.  matt and blazo show up to play.  so we watched them instead...they lost but both of them scored.  pretty good stuff. i have training with matt on saturday at 8 in the morning...i'm excited.  then i think i have training for my club team...i'm jacked about that too.

but soccer is definately my haven.  all i have in the world to just get the hell away from everything....but yeah.  if i could just play soccer for the rest of my life...never stopping...i'd be happy.it might get tiring though........hmmm ponder that.  
but yay two trainings on saturday!!!

"event","so fish.  they aren't so much fun when YOU DON'T TAKE THEM OFF!!!! chris killed a fish tonight. it now has three hooks in it's tum-tum.  not too delicious.  but we burned a lot of fun stuff today with a huge fire we had going.  bug spray is very flammable (fyi)  hair spray...contrary to popular belief...hairspray isn't so flammable.  it just puts out the fire! what the heck is that?  i dunno man...but now i'm going to go...watch the lizzie mcguire movie.  yay

"event","okay so i just had a ""conversation"" with tom about this whole deal.  now i'm wondering about everything!!  what the hell am i doing?  i don't even know. why can't everything just be simple? do i want to be with him or do i not want to.  sounds easy but it sure isn't.  i feel like i need to see what else is out there...but i don't want him to feel like he's not good enough...but how does that work? it doesn't.  blah...i hate being a highschooler way way way too much drama.  i just need to think things through i guess.  but i thought i already had........ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  i'm gonna go insane.  why can't things go back to the way they were? why can't i want to spend every second with him? why have i all of a sudden changed my mind? why can't he be that perfect guy that you can't let go? and why can't i find that guy? i guess i'm only young and have no idea what i'm saying. but i'm sick of being young. i want to be set in life.  yeah. but i guess that's all i have to say...

"event","i attempted to go to ""soccer sundays""  but only six of us showed up!  so we hit up abby's b-day party.  that was funner. then Torr, becks, col, and chris spent the night and we went to the mall today.  it was loads of fun...even though we tease torr about liking jordan (her cousin)  it's loads of fun. i'm glad we made his week though! yay
so this whole single thing...is and isn't working for me.  there are A LOT of cute boys out there that i never noticed but on the other hand, i dunno.  i think that i need to float freely for a while.  we'll see where it takes me.  
i have to work today.  yay doodle's!  yeah super fun but i'm excited for wednesday. PARTY AT CHRISTINAS!!  i'm pumped. but i must be off to work now.

"event","so yeah today at doodle's was super fun.  i was going crazy with only one glass of mountain dew!!  and and...matt mach dropped off my yearbook...he wrote the nicest thing.  i was impressed...i thought he didn't like me very much...but i guess not.  oh yeah and p.s. WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHEN THE NEXT TRAINING SESSION IS??? GEEZ...okay but yeah     
    so me and tom broke up.  i'm real sad about it but i guess that's what has to happen.  i really don't have a lot of time this summer...between work and sooo much soccer training.  it's gonna be crazy...i'll miss him though....MUCHO but yeah i don't really have anything else to say.... later DOODLE"

"event","so the banquet was awesome...it went really well.  i was a little nervous to show the video i started to hyperventilate.  it was crazy. i think the coaches liked their section at least i hope so.  shawn and matt both say they don't know if they are going to come back next year.  when shawn announced it, me and lander just looked at each other and almost cried.  even though he's mean to me sometimes i still really like him and i really look up to him...i dunno what i'll do if he leaves.  and matt well that's just a whole different story.  he's so cute haha but no really he's an awesome guy to have around, and he really knows the game of soccer.   he has been a big contributor to all the fun i've had with soccer.  i'll miss him too
and blazo, if he doesnt come back too...i might just have to quit.  i mean what's the point?  they are the ones who make it fun...i dunno if i could deal without them.  it'll be hard.  i wrote them all letters saying goodbye just in case.  i rewrote shawn and matts like five times each because i wasn't satisfied on how i said goodbye.  matt told me that i better be stopping by his house to drop off my yearbook.  he said he'd sign it for me!  yay i was upset that i forgot it today so i'm gonna take it over there...then maybe hit up blazo's house.  we'll see.  i'm really gonna miss soccer this summer.  this season was the best ever..our team actually got along and we all more or less like eachother...we're tight now. but i'm excited for LaForza.  i hope matt shawn and blazo come back...if not i'm gonna miss them so much it's not even true. well i'm outta here just wanted to update.  later DOODLE"

"event","Yay!  our soccer banquet is today...i'm real excited even though i have nothing to wear...i'm sure i can scrounge something up.  i have to finish writing my letters to matt, shawn, and blazo before 4:30.  but i'm really excited to show the video me, lander, chris and col made.  it's awesome.  at least it's super awesome for us never having done that whole video editing thing before.  mr. cheney was a big help though, even though he made fun of us alot cuz we were really lost.  computer illiterate.  oh well it was fun 27 hours in a sunless room...it's enough to drive you insane...but we got doodles so it's all good.
      speaking of doodles...i was working yesterday and BLAZO, lander chris col and abby came in.  that was a lot of fun. i can't believe blazo actually showed up and stayed for a while.  he's a lot cooler than matt and shawn ever were.  he doesn't act like he's too good for us.  but i guess he is a little closer to our age...not by much but he hasn't yet reached his twenties so i dunno. but he's really cool and i hope he sticks around. but we got him wondering about what's in the video about him... i hope he likes  it...but i know he will. haha.  if not well i put a lot of time into that baby so blah.  i know matt and shawn will be freakin out cuz that's just how they are.
    so i don't know what's going on between me and tom...but i dunno if it's good.  we don't have a lot to talk about anymore and that kinda sucks.  i hope i didn't mess up this relationship like i do all my other ones...i prolly did though.  geez.  once again why can't this just be easy???? i guess that would just be too nice.  oh well i'm only young and it's not the end of the world...there are lots of fish in the sea...(but who wants to date a fish?)
    well i have to start preparing for the banquet and things YAY BANQUET i'm pumped okay  later  doodles"

"event","well today was a pretty good day...i can't complain. i went shopping in novi at tjmaxx and marshals...good stuff i'll tell ya got a little boy polo for ten bucks from ralph lauren and a new xoxo wallet for 8 bucks!  lots of makeup too and some new shoes...pretty good i'd say...then i had to work though with three of the dumbest people like ever! ahh it drives me nuts...but i love my job so it's alright...i have to go to school tomorrow even though it's summer to work on my soccer video for the banquet.....it's awesome or at least it will be...but i can't give too much away.  
      i'm very confused these days about boys...sometimes i just don't know what to do...tom and i are still on a ""break"" and i guess it's not to bad being single...i hate to say it but it's just alot of weight off my shoulders...not having to worry about giving enough attention to him...and finally having a few minutes to myself...i dunno...i really do love him but i think maybe...well we'll just have to see...too tricky... i wish love could just be as simple as seeing a guy and knowing that you can't let that one go...geez  but yeah i think that's all i have to say for right now...later   DOODLE"

"event","well i just thought i'd get this live journal thing cuz a bunch of people had it so i thought that i would join the crowd...this week has been pretty tough...exams and me and tom keep fighting so we ""took a break"" whatever that means...i'm not quite sure how i feel about that but i guess it's supposed to help.  maybe we just needed some time apart but i'm not having too much fun with it...even if we were just always fighting i liked being with him...but oh well it'll work out in the end if it's supposed to.  but i miss him.  
    i'm also depressed cuz soccer's over for the school season but i have to say that this year has been the best year of soccer ever.  our team was so close and we really truly liked each other...team bonding and all that fun stuff...i also became a lot closer with my coaches (matt shawn and also the new one jordan blazo)  i guess because my real coach sucks so we had to turn to them...it was a bumpy season but we had a lot of fun though it.  i never realized how much our team meant to shawn and matt...i always thought they didn't care very much and that it didn't really matter how we did in games...but this year matt proved me wrong..he really did care alot when we had a losing streak and he was trying his best however he could to get us to see what potential our team has.  he really helped me get through this season and i learned a lot from him (not to mention made practice worth going to *wink wink*)
     but i'm really excited for club season this year. my coach steve is so cool and he was helping the school team for a while till jack made him stop cuz steve's cooler than him and he felt whats the word USELESS!!!  AHHH anyways i thin i'm done ranting and raving for now...later"

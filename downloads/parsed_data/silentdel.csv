Been awhile, just got done with wacky wednesday. Pretty crazy, fun times. School's killer, still trying to find time to hang out with friends and not flunk out of English.

Nothing much going on in my world. School in the week, friends on the weekend you know the score. Streetlight concert is coming around the corner, that'll be fun. On another note, I don't think i'm going to homecoming this year. No real group of friends to go with, and the friends I do have are going with their dates, seems kinda pointless anyway. I thought about it, there just doesnt seem to be alot of reasons to go for me at least. And with a theme like the bahamas, it's not exactly original or well thought out.(there's a beach 30?feet away from the school?). Ah well, I dont want to stay on it to much. Well, i'll talk to you all later.

First off, Cruise=time of life. Awesome, to the musical performance to late night talks to the realization i'm millions of miles away from any school related stress. Ahhh, good times, i'm already looking forward to another cruise this summer. I don't know when, I don't know where, but i'm going on one damn it, heh. Getting back to reality, school=aaaaaghhhh! But that's alright, i'll drown myself in my music and escape to easier times(or at least more comical ones. Funky Disco Chicken, dancing away! haha. Well, i'm not really happy, just not worrying about anything. You know I haven't had much drama this year. Maybe it's a little to early, or I might just have not noticed it happening. Eh! On an even less brighter side, I feel bad toward the New Orleands incident, hopefully that won't happen again(at least not for awhile). I get annoyed by all the news media critisizing the looting situation. hmmm, 
take food?
let it rot on the shelf...

tough choice, sure there's the person who tries to drag a plasma TV through flood waters for countless miles. I'm sure the guys either dead, or the TV's broken due to being dropped in the water. Bah, politics these days, those fools and their analysis on how horrible peoples behavior is without ever being able to experience how it is to make minimum amount of money per year, feed a family then lose your world. Yea, I could see someone taking a TV to see it for later. Hell, they don't have anything else left, enjoy some free HBO!

Short update, feeling better from last time(go figure), and my life's been alright. Nothing speacil, it's just been...what's the word...""Meh"" On the extreme brightside, cruise is coming soon and I can not waaaaaaaitt to get the hell out of here for that. Seriously, this will be the hardest week of school, not because of the work I have to do for Bonnik(though that will help), but because i'm constantly daydreaming of not being here. I know i'll be sad when I come back, I know I'll say it was way to short. But hell, right now, I'm just glad to know I'm going to go. Streetlight Manifesto concert on Oct. 1st (saturday) at 1PM. I've been dying to see them again, and with these things in the future, it makes my day a little brighter.

It's been awhile and man, I'm just not feeling to good right now. Life's fine and all but I keep thinking about so many different things that are changing and happening to people around me. Maybe I like thinking about them so I divert attention from my own life, I dont want things to change, if things could stay like this summer has been I think I'd be alright, not so much happy, but I wouldn't be depressed. I hate to sound like everyone when I say ""in the blink of an eye, life's passing me by"" because that's not true, it's taken a hell of a alot longer for life to pass me by than one blink. I just don't know if I like where i'm going, i'm confused, i'm running out of choices, feels like my path's getting narrower and narrower with every passing by and I want to escape it all. Just want to be able to go back and take that left turn instead of right. I guess i'm afraid of looking back at my life and saying ""DAMN IT! WHY THE HELL DIDNT I DO THAT!"" it's crazy, i'm feel like i'm already in a mid-life crisis, assesing myself and what i've been through. I just want to STOP. Rewind. Or at least keep it paused for awhile so I can enjoy now and not worry about tommorow. I feel sad, sad because well, I don't know if i'll be happy. And thanks in advance for all the ""you'll be fine, you're a great person"" and ""you'll feel happy in your future"" ""everything will work out just fine, don't worry"" those all are very nice and I apperciate you caring about me(what else can you do right?) But I just don't feel secure, I'm not alone, god knows I have some of the best people in the world I can turn to as friends both here and far away. But they won't always be with me, I need...assurance, I guess that's a fancy word for it. Who knows, maybe this will all pass in a week or two, or a year or three, like I said, to many uncertainties, for now, I feel weak in my stomach, and i'm gonna try and go to sleep ""I gotta get away from me.""

Just another average day..ok not really, went to work 8AM-8:30PM woot. pretty fun... anywho, Had a good time, saw Wedding crashers again with Mikhail, Megan, AJ, and Jake. Good times and a hilarious movie, though it was my second time eh, I still laughed like crazy at some of the parts.(cant wait for a third time, hehe)Anywho, man, its nice to hang out with friends even if the most conversation you have with the group is ""Oh look i'm hanggliding! honney take a picture, whoops im dead!"" lol. It's nights like these that make me glad i dont have any drama in my life right now. Or at least, the drama took a summer break. Hell with all the work i've been doing I think i've earned a little vacation from the typical ""he said, she said"" well I said ""I say, doesn't matter"" I'm happy with my life, sure, it could be a hell of a lot better. This quote will stay with me for a long time
Church ""No matter how bad thing's may seem...""
Caboose ""They could be worse.""
Church ""Nope no matter how bad they seem, they can't be any better, they can't be any worse. Cause that's the way things fucking are, and you better get used to it nancy, quit you're bitching.""

So true, so i'm gonna stop my ""bitching"" for the time being and enjoy the company of friends, because really, without them, I'd be...well..really bored. And!..no wait, that's about it. Thanks for the good times everyone, and all I can hope is that I get another chance to have more of them.

Yea,life's life, if i've said it once i've said it ten journal entries before, it's all pretty much the same. Gym, work, friends, sleep, rinse, and repeat. I dont know why I still feel like i'm not doing anything to..to..hell i dont even know what it is I want to do anymore. I'm getting fed up with being so polite to complete assholes, you know humans have a pretty cruel sence of humor(i'm sure you already knew). For example, I'm working today and there's this co-worker named ""Bea"" who honestly is pretty ugly mainly because of her teeth, seems like smoking and chewing tabacoo caught up with her with yellowish-blackish teeth. It's pretty nasty, yes. However, I had this lady and her daughter(who was about 18-21) come in and say ""Is that lady with the hideous mouth still work here?"" I'm kinda shocked and nudge me head over to the back and mouth the words ""she's in the back"" as to you know, make her feel bad considering she migh have heard and gotten upset. she just replies with a plain voice "" Oh, I don't care if she's here."" And I just kinda get angry on the inside and at this point I want to get her out of the door to avoid the topic of picking on others. But NO! She goes on saying ""besides, it's her fault for not going to the dentist that she looks that way."" I swear to God, that ticked me off, she's lived in poverty her whole life from what i've heard and lives by herself making about $10000 a year at subway and this bitch acts as if she's had all the chances in the world to have a perfect life. So her saying that made me feel like saying ""Well jee, then I guess it's your fault for being so fat you have to come to subway instead of affording LIFO suction."" but no, I fake a smile to get through the line with her and never say another word to her but come on people! What kinda of stuck up prick says that with absolutly no concern if she gets her feelings hurt. She acted as if she was all high and mighty as her daughter laughed with her after she said it. It frustrates me to no end that people like her can live with themselves and never experience the amount of pain or anguish of others misfortunes. I try to se what others see, see why they feel the way they do, how they came to their conclusions and for godsake how they'll feel when I say my next sentence. I've hurt people's feelings through out my life and I dont think i'll ever be able to forgive myself. It pains me everytime I remember even the smallest things, even the things that were forgiven by others, even the things they may not have been hurt by or may not regret happening. I try so hard to make others feel better, the some asshole comes and ruins it like her. It's ridiculous, ignorant, and...ah who am I kidding, I can't change the world, I can't change the way people act or judge. I probably have no right to judge others as humans. But I will anyway, that person's remarks make her dead to me. and now, since she's dead, I won't have to worry about it. In lighter news, a girl walked in and as a rang up her order and said the whole have a good one thing, she said ""thanks Vince"" and I was bewlidered and said ""what? wait! who are you?"" and she didnt stop, she did say ""Allana, from kindergarden."" and I was like wow...I have no idea who she is. my memory sucks. and...well..yep, that was my highlight. Talk to you all later, think twice before you speak

Yep, I know, I don't ever update this thing, I keep looking at my friends list to see what everyone else is doing, I forgot about the two people who want to know about me ^_~(who I pay off well to read this). Anywho, with a second job and all i've been putting in a good 55+ hours a week. Should be fun, my life pretty much revolves around a job, the gym, the movies, and my friends houses. I don't know how i'm doing so many things but I still feel like i've got a ton of stuff undone. There's a lot of people I need to talk to more, but aside that i'm just trying to stay busy, stay active...and not sit on my ass all day staring at a TV/computer. Tigran leaves for the airforce tommoro...today, i wished him good luck and goodbye. Sad to see a great friend leave and I hope to hear from him soon. I'm incredibly thankful I don't have school, I realize how much I can do without worrying about homework, grades, or projects, were almost halfway through summer and I wish it would never end. The thing is, the most important part of my summer is at the end with the cruise. I can't wait to see everyone and enjoy those days of my life. I've come across a ton of great music within the past weeks I dont know what to do with it, so I burned them on CD's ^_^. I need an I-pod or something because I dont have enough room for all the CD's in my car. I've been trying to start open movie invites lately. Really i'm just trying to spend time with familar faces and laugh without worrying about who's saying/doing what behind anothers back. Drama's for lamers dude, I don't need it, I don't want it, I don't have it...not yet, it'll come. Until then, i'm satisfied with what i'm working with, love you all, you have no idea :)

How's everyone been? Good? Good to hear, Two AP tests down, one left to go, I really want to pass the Psych AP test, think i'll study after i'm done making this entry. Anywho, within the past however many days, these have pretty much been the highlights. Prom pre-dance was fun lots of goofing around, love having fun with a bunch of friends around just to enjoy and laugh. The dance was nice, kind of what I expected it to be, for better or worse; depends on how you look at it I guess. Adam's talking about going to New York for an extended weekend in late June, that sounds like fun. Looking forward to meeting some people I know up there again. You know so many people tell me New York's great and they can't wait to go their when they're older. As if New York is some paradise of what everyone wants, meh. Probably won't live up to the hype, but we'll see. Other than that, I really haven't done much, goofed around after the movie. I wouldn't say Kingdom of Heaven was bad...it just wasnt what I expected it to be...at all..I wouldn't say it's story driven..because the story sucked. And there was close to no action or major battle scenes...soo I would say if you feel like staring at Orlando Bloom for an 2 hours, then you'll find something to enjoy in this movie.

New York
By: Chronic Future


Well all these people of the city will keep you in their blind spots
Especially when they know that you're out looking to sign dots
I tried to tell this girl, how twisted my mind got
But it's her dream to ride the conveyer belt of that side walk
She's got intentions of being number one
But can she handle rejection in the city of no sun
Where bricks change colors faster than careers do
And few people drive away and like what's in their rearview

New york city's so far away
But i can't wait here for one more day
They say these things come and these things go
But if I don't try I'll never know

She don't care what it takes, she knows she's got the ability
And with what her folks make
She knows she'd have stability
She just needs to get out there
And step toward her validity
She can't keep dying over this
Because it's just killing me
She's not used to foot steps digging in her chest
High heeled investments and suit's getting undressed
Growing old and having new recruits become the best
And finding that she's stepped on everyone and no one's left

New york city's so far away
But i can't wait here for one more day
They say these things come and these things go
But if I don't try I'll never know

New york city's so far away
But i can't wait here for one more day
They say these things come and these things go
But if I don't try I'll never know

Well it hurts like walking barefoot on light bulbs
Smashing ideas with open skin
Till the pearl white drops of blood turn red
And everyone can tell
That you've worked hard enough
It's time to go,
Go get your map and compass and don't listen to them
And don't think about how much time you're fixing to spend
The dirt only ends when the pavement begins
This is your heart, your dream,
And you're your only friend, so go!

You can kick the earth as hard as you want..
To show your frustration,
Or you can get in your car and kick your foot to the gas
And keep accelerating till you hit your destination
So go!"

Been a slow week. Not much has been going on, had some trouble with a close friend of mine and his family, luckily it's all been solved for the better and man life seems short. I feel like all of high school's passing by and i'm not doing anything with it that I should be. I think I missed the boat or the train or whatever it was I need to catch. Maybe it's just me, maybe everyone feels this way towards everyone else, but it seems so many people have more intresting lives than me. Not to say my life's bad, but it could sure use a bright spot every now and then to clean off the rust. I partly wish this high school thing would end and last forever at the same time. Guess i've been really mixed up lately. And sorry I can never put out the words to make intresting conversation Leanne. I probably do have alot to say/talk about, but I dont know, it feels akward to just splurt out something. All whining and moaning aside, I did have a good time out today, The Interpriteur(Sp) was good and worth seeing, and the S&S afterward was well worth it, hehe I love the movie group, always a fun night out with them. heh, ah well, I'll talk to you all later, best of luck in life and i'm always here to listen.

Sorry I havent updated in so long, I keep meaning to but then I get caught up in something else and what not so I usually pass it by without notice. Well, the Ska concert I went to was a total blast long story told short we went from a car crash to riding there and back with a free limo. That was one of the greatest days of my life lol, tons of fun. Anyway, aside that, a bunch of things have reached a resolution with the finish of this school symester(spring break!), the exclusion of a certain someone who played one of my friends for a fool, and a couple other things that remind me that life is life. I met my old best friend from Pre-K(aside Mik), his names Raymond, we caught up and seem to be getting along great as friends again. It's good to know that some people are just the way you remember them and more. Aside that my life has been kinda blah. Got report cards and of course C in French :P saw that coming. Everything else was great though. Itwas really dreary today, Rain is so depressing, I need some sunshine in my life(in more than one way). Talk to you all later, have a good one, keep in touch

It's beeen awhile, and not muched has changed, school's been pretty annoying as i'm finding myself having to do more and more work just to catch up. But I dont mind, this past weekend was alot of fun, though i've lost some sleep(now that I know that not sleeping will increase my life span I dont feel as bad, heh). looking forward to the ska concert the 21st, i'm just not looking forward to the school inbetweeen here and there. From what i've heard, no one has anything planned for V-day(unless going to school and then work counts as a plan), kinda ironic that the holiday associated with love and happiness probably gets more people depressed than happy. Hopefully, everyone's day will be a little brighter and better tommorow, enjoy it! What's not to love? it's a beautiful monday to go to school!*grumble*...heh, right, have a good one guys, happy V-day

love ya,

"event","Now I sit me down in school

Where praying is against the rule

For this great nation under God

Finds mention of Him very odd.



If Scripture now the class recites,

It violates the Bill of Rights.

And anytime my head I bow

Becomes a Federal matter now.



Our hair can be purple, orange or green,

That's no offense; it's a freedom scene.

The law is specific, the law is precise.

Prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice.


For praying in a public hall

Might offend someone with no faith at all.

In silence alone we must meditate,

God's name is prohibited by the state.



We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks,

And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks.

They've outlawed guns, but FIRST the Bible.

To quote the Good Book makes me liable.


We can elect a pregnant Senior Queen,

And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King.

It's ""inappropriate"" to teach right from wrong,

We're taught that such ""judgments"" do not belong.

 


We can get our condoms and birth controls,

Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles.

But the Ten Commandments are not allowed,

No word of God must reach this crowd.


It's scary here I must confess,

When chaos reigns the school's a mess.

So, Lord, this silent plea I make:

Should I be shot; My soul please take!

Amen"

Finally, I have my computer back. Anyway, to get caught up on this past weekend. I went to Miami to babysit these two kids so I can have money to buy X-mas presents for my friends. Anyway, I will never go back to doing that again. The two kids are a nine year old named Kyle and an eleven year old named Brandon. And i'm sorry, but I couldn't help but feel pity for our generations to come. Seem's the only thing on Brandon's mind was to tell me all about his sex life the first day. And maybe it's just me but since when do you brag about how far you've gotten with a girl at age eleven. I mean come on! that's sick, and the sad thing is he really wants to get laid by the end of this year, he already drinks without his parents consent when they are not home and still acts like an immature little brat for his age. The nine-year old boy was better only because he didn't talk as much. What's this world coming to? I didn't even know any cuss words till about late 7th and started saying them in 8th casually. This kids in sixth grade and already cusses like no tommorow trying to think of every possible insult...is this really what's becoming cool? God save us all.

haven't written in awhile, let me try and catch up on a few things this past weekend.

HHN was good, the ride there was full of amusing things, James gave Adamoto a scare. And leanne played match maker!(though not in the normal sense lol) While in the park, well... It stunk that they sold out of express passes and it took an hour-hour and 30 minutes to actually get to ride something. This ended up limiting Adam, me, and company to three rides, one being a haunted house. Not scary, mainly confusing was the disorintorium, and the corn feild and fright yard was greatly disappointing except the guy with the flamethrower was cool. Other than that, the ride home and getting to sleep was exhuasting 5 friggin AM man. We didn't stop talking until then, crazy males. The worst part about the trip happens ironically today and i'm gonna guess tommorow. People with their gossip, Drama kills me(figurativly and literaly sometimes), I'm glad i've been left out for the most part with this 'episode' but my heart goes out to all who are caught up in this nonsense. Is there really a point to rumors? What causes such things to be created? Jealousy? Do some people actually enjoy watching dramatic conflict unfold? Je ne sais pas! hope everone else is doing ok, wish I could talk online to all of ya.

Well he makes us print crap off the internet web page and we need it in our notebook. My printer doesnt work, so I took a friends yesterday and I copied like 50 pages worth(took 2 hours or so). I wake up, and forget them at home. So I end up calling my mom in the begining of class while the teachers not looking and she brings it to me before he collects it so my friend gets his stuff and I get mine. Then, I hole punch like 50 pages worth of stuff during class. Trying to hurry before the bell rings and I get it all done and organized. Finnally class ends and after school at Cross Country practice he says ""You know what, funny thing Vince, you know the notebook? Your's wasn't in it."" So all that crap and I end up getting a 0 for forgeting. Great stuff, I'll be garenteed a D with this(we only have 4 grades in the class), I usually don't even get a C in any class so I can't wait to see what my parents have to say about this...yes I can.. ah well, I'm gonna go and fall asleep.

So much good it does to care for friends when all I get is to be the number 1 A-hole on the SL. ah who cares, it'll pass over by tommorow anyway. I'm to emotionally unstable lately, I need to get my mind straight and not drag those I love down with me. Sorry to upset everyone, I really want to help.. and makes things as they were.

Parents, they never truly understand where and how they affect peoples lives and how much good we all do in this world for one another.

We just got power a couple hours ago. You really never realize how much AC effects your life till its gone for 4 days straight. I'm hoping everyone was better off than I was and had no serious damage. I hate choosing sides, kids these days and there drama. Anywho, i've been kinda out of touch with the world. Life's been good, kinda dull actually. Yep, kinda stinks that people change in the world. Maybe it's just me, but nothing really seems to have changed in how people are or act. Or maybe its not so much people change, but they grow closer and/or farther away from friends. Either way, personality wise no one's really changed for the worse if not everyone's alot more mature on there aspects. Still, I do wish things were like they used to be sometimes, and be able to talk with each other without shame or discretion.. Yet, I don't know, maybe I am a completly different person than I once was. Maybe i'm unable to think like I once did. Maybe i'm unable to care like I once did about people and things.

School's not for another 2-? days so enjoy while the peace lasts(first weekend..5 days...hmmm nice start to school :) heh). One Vincent after the incident stated,  ""Well, I'm having a friend stay the night since he has no electricity so you know, share the wealth(i'm charging him hourly for internet acess)."" But with that news done, we all need to help one another through, just like we do in english class *shivers*. Other than that we head back to Vince for sports, Vince? Thanks Vinchenzio, well Cross Country's starting up aaaaaannnnd we're looking foward to a season full of hopelessness and despair. Back to you Vinney. And in our top story we head to ""V"" with the in depth preception on what we call ""history"" ""V"" take it away. thank you. History, it's the building stop for the next generation, or that big book you never quite read the whole thing in class. History, something that can never be changed or simply something that never was meant to be changed. Having researched some earlier documents of my interaction with humans(saved IM conversations). I find history is not always a pretty thing...Actually, most of the time it's a repetitive, drawn-out, and boring thing..Like most Math teachers. Truth being, we all make historical changes in our lives almost everyday(mainly the days you don't stay in bed all day). The past is a warped sense of reality to me. I find it hard, looking back now, to try and think the way i was thinking when I typed to people. Yea, the past sucks, but in conclusion. The only way to look is foward and bring with you a better tommorow as opposed to a unforgiving yesterday..(<----Now that's a good quote!)"

"event","Hey all, today was like any other day. Mrs. Tenery is really getting annoying with her whole no talking policy, don't know why she decided we couldn't talk but whatever. Aside that second block we played kickball with the 'speacil kids downstairs' out in the feild. It was fun, we ussually were helping them on where to run after they kicked but, there was never a dull moment. hehe, one of the kids even kicked the ball and hit his teacher knocking her back lol I would have felt bad had she not been laughing along with everyone else. Third was presentations which was good, I think this assignment was just an 'easy A' type thing because I haven't seen an actual bad presentation yet, Nathan's was pretty funny with his Polka song from weird al. Fourth block we almost got done watching the movie ""Manon de spring"" and for an old movie it really has alot of twists and turns you wouldn't expect. Anywho, the ride home seemed harsher with conversation and i'm surprised we actually did talk about an issue with the agruing that happened at the begining. Oh well, take the good days with the bad eh? Got home, watched little TV then did chores. Went in the pool and from now on i'm just gonna lounge by the pool and try to become a tanner me. Took a shower, and after garbage and recycle went down I came back here to update. Hope everyone has a good weekend, I probably won't update but one never knows. I might actually have something to say Friday/saturday/sunday night :) but not likely, Peace.

"event","Hey all, nothing much happened today. First block I was daydreaming about sleeping, yes pathetic but comphorting all the same. Second block we watched a video ""phenominom(sp)"" it's pretty good so far. Third we did our speechs today, everyone did great and got 90 or higher which is good. Fourth we watched a video and did a little worksheet thing I think. Either way the school year's winding down so classes are pretty calm. On the ride home I talked to Leanne and Nick about some intresting subjects. I love talking serious sometimes almost as much as I do joking around, thanks you two. Aside from that got home took a nap then woke up for my sister's graduation from Kindergarden at Temple beth el? They put on a cute play and then we ate...and ate...and drank some juice...then ate, they had alot to eat after all was said and done..not so much after I left but eh, what'd you expect. Well, that's all for today, all I really have to do is study my frnech lines for friday. C ya'll later

"event","Yep, I'm going to buy the CD and play Iris by the Goo goo dolls for the class wednesday as a song that describes me. Only relating to the chrous, I thought it'd be hard to write a long paragraph on it. But I thought about it and I could really get to talking on how that one line ""I just want you to know who I am."" really is the whole point I picked the song. For those who don't know the chorus just scroll down I posted the whole song not to long ago. I figure the paragraph will go something like this:

*chorus from the song pasted in quotes* The above is the main reason I chose this song. The line that best portrays the idea i'm trying to get across is ""I just want you to know who I am."" I feel that people take to much time judging others on outside looks, not like i'm saying to walk up to your friendly everyday biker with flowers and choclates, but to a lesser extreme than that. For example, when people take a look at me, what's the first immpression you get? *improvise an awnser if any shouts a statement, if no one says anything i'll say:* Guy must be good with computers, probably quite and non-social? Must be one of those ""I never fail a test, type students. Let's copy off him."" heh, Never fail a test...I wish. ***optional thinking: Another example is Mrs. Caveretta, what'd you all think when you first saw her on the way in this class the first day? (probably some random slanderous or sarcastic comment from the class clown or something. Improvise answer, if no one speaks, ""Ah, smart, well like you all for the sake of my grade i'll keep it to myself."")*** But point being when you get to know someone they're ussually not the person you thought them by first glance. Even with this song to describe me, those who don't know me as a friend still won't understand who I am. So I honestly ""Don't think the world would understand."""

"event","I probably should write in this thing more often but i'm just that boring :P. Either that or i'm to lazy to type my life's events for all to see. Anyway Friday was fun, schools pretty much over for me except for french even english isn't that bad except for trying to find a song that describes me... it's tough i've come down to six songs.

Iris- Goo goo dolls
Meaning of Life- Offspring
Race Agaisnt Myself- Offspring
All I want- Offspring
What's my Age again?- Blink 182
Staring at the Sun- Offspring

So odds are it'll be an Offspring song but who knows! Anyway, the latest thing that happened in my life would be Troy, which was great, and Saturday AJ's party which was great, nothing speacil swimming in a pool, playing some games watching movies and just hanging out with a bunch of friends makes a great time in itself. Anywho, I really don't know if I missed something or what but I can't think of anything else. I'll see you all later and hope you all have had a great weekend and will have a great last full week of school.

"event","Hey all, incase you don't already know, my computers at the shop so I won't be posting much at all till its back(not like i post that much anyway). But I have to write about today, it was wierd how everthing kinda played out. School really had nothing speacil accept for french, thats right, French, our teacher talked of philosiphy for a good majority of the class and it got me thinking for awhile. On the way home espically since Leanne and Nick were having there argument over overall human nature being good or bad. But, I don't know i felt intrested on how they both thought wha the other was saying and how they responded back, not to be mean or anything it's just I had a weird feeling of seeing to worlds collide and try and resolve each others points. Mostly I agreed that humans have both good and bad, but more so good than the other simply because everyone strives to be the 'better' person, that itself is human nature. I do believe that homo-sexuality is an unnatural thing, but I also believe that the people can't help the way they are and you've got to respect the way a person is no matter what. If we didn't then we'd all just be ignorant to everything around us, right? Well anyway, though I didn't LIKE the arguing I enjoyed listening to there conversations just the same. When I got home I felt it was about time to catch up with some ""well deserved"" rest, so off I dozed...

Maybe it was the conversation in the car I had just listen to, or perhaps the philosiphy talk of life in class, but for some reason this dream was the most unique i've ever had. It started as me at the edge of my driveway. I began to walk down the long road as i had all my life. As I took my first couple steps I saw a boy and a girl kneeled over on the right side, to look over I realized they were my childhood friends, brandon and Melisa, that was the day Brandon stole a lighter and I was afraid by lighting leaves on fire he endangered the neighborhood. I kept walking.. I noticed the road, which had once been straight changed to two paths, one with Brandon and Melisa and one with Michal Corn(another boy whom had become enemies to the others). As i was about to walk I saw myself next to me say what I said years ago.. ""I'm sorry guys, but 3 against one isn't fair"" and with that he walked over to Michal. I looked toward Brandon and Melisa thinking of turning toward them but went down the same way. Again, the road was long and steaight. I walked and Andrew, as he little kid I knew him to be walked beside me, as we walked he picked up a frog, a lizard, and put his arm straight out with a snake dangling on his arm and said ""Remember that?"" and I smiled saying ""yea, had me worried sick, good times"" and he laughed and suddenly dropped the frog to pick up a football. This he threw as far as I could see, he then picked up a Powerade on the road, full and not opened, and walked away. Now this may have sounded random but to me it was telling me exactly what had happened, In 7th grade, the grade where we lost touch as great friends I used to save up my lunch money each day to buy Andrew and 3 other people aside myself a powerade by friday. Though I know it was a lost cause, I did it almost every week in some pathetic attempt to I guess keep him as a friend but he went into other groups, not necisarily bad groups, but one thing led to another and you know. So in a way I think it was symbolizing what had happened. I continued walking to see two more young girls, none other than Stacy Ritterbeck and Jessica, my two best friends from 1st-3rd. They looked as innocent as ever and carried power ranger dolls which later I found funny, I never express humor or laughing in my dreams, don't know why. Every person that i've met in my life walked beside me and told of a point, or summarized what we had/have accomplished over the years while i walked down this eternal road. The people i've known for longer times appeared more than once like Mikhail, he showed to me as the blond everyday kid and talked to me about how he misses our days of ""beating up"" chad, Raymond came to me also and said the same thing, Mikhail came back later ripping at test paper in half and throwing it away in a conveinently placed trash can in the middle of the road(seems this road had everything). Raymond Langruage(sp) came back with a holy bible in one hand and a basketball in the otherbouncing it casually. Josh came to me holding a Kamoto Dragon which in 6th grade I remember he lied of having one in his back yard. He later came back to me as...well as he is today. Michelle, you came in a uniform, probably from track and at one point you talked about the meaning of life, which we had a long conversation of but I can only remember bits and pieces, you made the motion as if you were going to pull out your hair, I tried to comphort and all that crap I always try to do but you ended up running off to a person I didn't recognize with a car across the street, and you drove off smiling with an FSU hat on. Leanne, you were sitting in a desk in the middle of the road minding your own busniess, I tapped you on the shoulder and you turned around with a smile. As you walked, some of your friedns that I never knew waved hi, and you waved back with joy. You actually talked more of others than you did of you and me, which everyone else so far seemed to relate the subjects to me, from what I remember you talked about crashes(from cars), Football(for very little), Boys(sarcasitcally...I hope), standards(that people are held to), and boys agian (not so sarcastically). You eventually ended up picking up a flag off the road and walking off. Honest to god, Every/Single/Person i've known as a friend walked beside me and walked off. It continued on with Kim, she walked along side was very quite at first but later on talked about friendship, not of us but in general the way friends should act to one another. I'm sure we talked of specific people but its hard to remember who at what time. She eventually left waving a movie ticket in a goodbye gesture. Amanda came next she pulled up next to me in her car and waved. She didn't stay to long as she just drove off soon after seeing she was glad to see me. Megan came walking the opposite direction of me reading something, she waved hi but didn't stop walking or turn around to walk in my direction, the book didn't have a title but it was red one one side of the cover and purple on the other. Andrew came back with a paintball gun and looked as he does today, he shot randomly in the air, he talked about marksminship and strategy for paintball, which is what he ussually talks about anyway. I don't remember why he left but AJ came soon after, she talked in a really girlie voice quoted ""I'm so happy I have someone."" and with that she walked off in the same direction as Andrew. Aleshia came talking about how life's unfair and how she's glad she has someone to pll her through hard times, Jeff in case you guys didn't know her bf. Theresa and Kirsten came in later after aleshia got on a bike and drove off. They both were very quite and talked to themselves when I'd say something. I ended up leaving them as I had finnally reached the end of the street and the middle of the circle's clubhouse. Walking inside I saw Adamoto at the entrance, he took me over to a table and we sat down to talk. He spoke of his experiences of love, and more so on the despair feeling of what everyone feels as he explained it. Richie was also there, I didn't talk to him though I went to talk to him there were to many people in the way drinking beer cans and he was occupied talking to two girls on both sides of him wom I didn't recognize, he gave a nod of recognition and I returned it but that was it. No one I knew there was drinking, though there were a couple people who seemed to be high and offered me a smoke while I was walking but I turned that down. Along with a beer offered by some guy I didn't recognize which I also turned down. I walked to the kitchen to see Jacop backside faced to me with a can (i assumed beer can) at his mouth and he had his head back like he was drinking the last bit of it. I said with disapointment, ""Jacop!"" and he turned around and said with simplicity, ""What? its Juice."" It was then that I noticed it was in fact a minute maid can. I walked out the kitchen door and that's where the dream ended. I'll talk to you all later, trust me...this dream got me thinking about alot of things in my life...and i'm thankful for each one of them.

Peace and Love, (no i'm not a hippie)

"event","So Lesley just called me and gave me the results of her visit to the Mayo Clinic down in Rochester, MN.  Apparently her liver problem is the result of a problem with her heart and she now has to have open heart surgery to fix her tricuspid valve.

My heart goes out to her... really.  She is one of the strongest people that I know and I am convinced that she will defeat this new obstacle that has been thrown her way.  I love her to pieces and it pains me that she has to go through this.

God, please watch over her and make her heart better.  She's an earth bound angel in my eyes."

"event","I just wanted to state on here my prayers to all of those affected by the Virginia Tech shootings.  It is horrifically disturbing and it pains me to no end that violence such as this has been escalating throughout our nation; our world.  Nobody has the right to cause so much pain and destruction and yet we are seeing more and more instances of people doing exactly that.  I refuse to stand for it and I refuse to listen to others try and excuse the behavior by blaming others.  

I do think that we should all band together in unity and pray for all of those affected by the appalling and inexcusable behavior we have witnessed.  God bless all of those who are mourning friends and loved ones in the aftermath of this extraneous massacre."

<lj-cut text=""Click Here for Lyrics"">
I never had all the answers
I never had enough time
But I sure had all the reasons
Why you weren't what I wanted to find

I never laid all my cards out
You just wanted to play
The king he waited on my doorstep
While the joker and me went on our way

Maybe I was much too selfish
But baby you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

These days everything is all business
Never in one place for too long
And there's no lack of arms around me
But I still wonder if somewhere I went wrong

Mabye I was much too selfish
But baby you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

And I'd wish on every star
In the southern sky
For that man and our life
If I did not think that

Yes I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee....

"event","New look, dear friend.  Well, this has become my personal online journal I guess.  All of my recent posts have been private and I'm guessing that they are going to continue to be private posts.  All of my public posts have gone over to MySpace (yes-- I converted), but this journal?  This is where I pour my heart and soul into words of expression.  

Therefore, I decided it needed a makeover.  So, ta-da!  We'll see how long this look will last.  ;)  My guess?  Probably won't last as long as the last look, but hey.  You never know."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Me ranting about how life is treating one of my friends..."">So... I have a little problem with life right now.  It is proving to be very trying and unfair.  Things are pretty good with me... I still have some personal issues that I am trying to work through right now, but overall things are good with me.  My legs aren't paralyzed anymore, I have graduated from physical therapy and I'm on my way to full recovery as we speak.  I can move around pretty good and I never use my cane anymore.  My little problem with life is actually stemming from my friends.  Especially one in particular right now and it just breaks my heart to see her like this.

This friend is the strongest person I think I have ever had the privilege to meet and she has such a big heart.  I mean, to just sit there and talk to her about her Angels of the Night idea and how she wants her children to follow her footsteps in giving up their Thanksgiving to go serve the homeless.  To have her kids beside her as she donates various items to all kinds of different charities.  For wanting to make a difference and the world and then actually going out there and DOING it.  The stong person has been through so much.  She's been to California partying it up on the beach to living with marines down in Louisiana to begging on the streets of New York while pregnant and all alone.  Despite all she does for the world and what a good person she is - life continues to throw obstacles at her that truly test her willpower.  

We only met a year ago but it honestly feels as though she is one of my sisters.  And it hurts me to see her go through this pain.  She is always putting up this front right now that everything is okay and she can handle anything life throws at her.  But she is barely treading water and I feel so helpless knowing that I can only be there for her and I can't make all of her problems disappear.  

She's currently in the process of getting a divorce from a man that she doesn't even know anymore.  A man that has tried to kill himself multiple times (ending up in the hospital in critical condition), has broken into her house and tried to commit suicide there, has tried to kill her, has used their 2 kids against her, and who has become so manipulative and power hungry that I truly do worry about what will happen the next time he flies off the handle.  He already signed over his parental rights to her, which is a good battle for her to win, and hardly spends time with his 2 kids.  Meanwhile, she has become a single mom of 2 kids.  A 3 and a half year old and a 1 year old.  The 3 year old is a girl who *every* single night cries to her mom about how she misses daddy.  

Now don't get me wrong.  I know there are a lot of single moms out there and I know that she isn't the only one going through this predicament either.  All I am saying is that it is tough and a tad unfair.  

I just wish her the best of luck right now.  I only want the absolute best for her and her kids.  She is a truly magnificent person.</lj-cut>

On a lighter note though... found a kick-ass quote.

Happy St. Patrick's Day from a Rosemount Irish High School Alumni.  And hey, what do you know.  That includes you Michelle!!!  

Since my last post I have acquired 2 new members to the family.  Ben and Brady... my half papillon, half american eskimo munchkins.  Twin brothers, they are named after 2 quarterback greats.  Ben Roethlisberger from the Steelers and Tom Brady the beautiful man for the Patriots.  They are quite trying on the patience, but loveable overall.  

Also, spring is just around the corner. Monday in fact.  And, of course, to help welcome in the first day of snow --- since this past Monday we have had 2 huge snow storms equating to about 19 inches of thick, wet, heavy, white snow.  Can we say fun?

I am so firing the current groundhog as soon as I find him.  Or else I'll hire Donald Trump.  He's good at saying 'you're fired'.  That raises the question of how much does it cost to hire Donald Trump.

Time to finish the dishes.  Ta-ta for now."

In Minnesota it would be completely accurate to start singing ""It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"" everytime one looks outside.  We definitely have that blanket of white snow.  I love it.  Well, to put it more accurately, I love it <i>right now</i>.  It's still that fresh snow that sparkles like diamonds.  Soon it will be that disgusting brown-ish snow with footprints and car tracks in it.  

But it is BEAUTIFUL right now.

"event","<b>Confessions</b>

<b>1.</b> I am a hypocrite. I always complain about people putting up Christmas decorations and singing Christmas carols before Thanksgiving... but I listen and sing Christmas carols before Thanksgiving.  And enjoy it.

<b>2.</b> I went and saw <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> without Michelle on Sunday night as soon as I got back from Tennessee after the funeral.  I just couldn't wait another minute.<b>**</b>

<b>3.</b> I enjoyed the movie despite how rushed it is and how different people are saying different things and doing different things and how messed up some of it became... let's just say that if I hadn't just re-read (for the umpteenth time) Goblet of Fire I probably wouldn't have noticed as many differences.  Yet somehow... I still liked the movie.  Even if the idiots took out the Quidditch World Cup. The idiots.

<b>4.</b> I absolutely should be in bed right now, but I'm not.

<b>5.</b> I hate the cold weather, but I love snow.  Mother Nature needs to change her way of doing things, methinks.

<b>5.</b> Last confession of the night?  I can positively promise you that these are not my true confessions.  Why would I put those on a public post?  It's hard enough to live with them let alone see them in black and white type right in front of your face. 


<b>Notes:</b>
*   Look at me!  I'm almost like Usher!  (Michelle... It's the song that used to always come on the radio when we were in the car!)

**  Michelle... I am still going to go see it*** with you!  Don't think you are off the hook that easily.  I just couldn't wait any longer and you know that I have zero patience or self-control when it comes to these kinds of things. Am going to North Dakota for Thanksgiving and won't be back until Sunday evening.  I'll have to call you sometime in the next few days and we'll try to figure out a solution.

***   It means the movie Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  Not like you didn't know that.****

****   That is me referring to you as Miss Smarty Pants.  So HA!"

"event","So yeah.  It's been almost 10 months since my last update.  That's just downright insane considering my livejournal used to be the sun my life revolved around.  How things change, eh?

I'm pretty sure there isn't anyone out there anymore that looks at this.  Nearly 10 months of silence will do that.  So this is basically just for me.  A chance to get something down in words that I can look back on later and reflect upon.  Almost like a pensieve in a way.

Speaking of pensieves... Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire movie comes out soon-ish.  November 18th to be exact.  My friend Michelle and I are counting down the days and neither of us can wait to see it.  Looks like it might be halfway decent.  Nowhere near as good as the books of course.  That would be a simply impossible feat to acheive in my opinion.  Anyway I am rambling... not that it really matters.

I'm still in school and I still work my ass off at the job.  Now include planning a wedding to the mix and I'm strapped for free time.  But I'm loving it right now.  Next on my list?  To eventually get another Maggie because my puppy is attached to my dad and I just couldn't take her away from him.  So I am in the midst of looking for a blue heeler/lab mix puppy.  Probably wont bother getting one for a bit though... however that particular mixed breed is hard to find!  So if I find an opportunity --- I most likely will not pass it up.  

Short post, but frankly I don't give a damn."

"event","I just couldn't fall asleep tonight.  All of life's little worries suddenly crashed down all around me and now I feel completely and totally lost.  A full blown emotional breakdown in other words.

One of the biggest worries of mine lately has been this.  What if... a decision that we have made is the wrong decision.  Do our lives ever get back on the right track?  Or are we forever screwed up in life from that moment on?  What if the repercussions are so great that we can never recover the losses that amount from said decision(s)?

I always tell myself and my friends to live a life with as little regret as physically and humanly possible.  Is that an impossible motto to live by?  Frankly, if every decision has such a life-altering effect... how can we even consider not feeling regret over past actions?  We are only human and to be human is to make errors.  It seems to me as if we, as a human race, are all destined for failure.  And this makes everything seem hopeless to me.  Or have I just lost faith?

To top it all off, I think that within the past two years of my life I have made quite a few big mistakes.  Will I ever be okay with those decisions?  I feel like my life is spiraling out of control and all I can do is stand back and watch it disappear from me.  

The irony?  I did all of this to myself simply by the decisions I have made.  I guess we truly do bring about our own destruction."

Should be interesting, methinks.

In other words, I'm not dead yet.  Just busy as ever and anxious for spring semester.  It just may be a brand new crazed level of hell that I made for myself, but I'm good at that.  Hmmm.  Possible new major?  Self-destruction, B.S.  And yes, that would be a bachelor of science.  Then again, self-destruction is kind of an art... wouldn't you think?  Must contemplate on this... in about 2-3 years I'm thinking.

So yeah, the All School, All Work, No Play Semester begins in 19 hours and 20 minutes.  My freedom is quickly vanishing before my very eyes.

Oh, and Songs Of Susannah (aka Dark Tower VI) was very good.  About to start the final installment (aka Dark Tower VII) today.  Am excited.  Joy."

"event","I knew the race for president was going to be close.  I didn't think it would be this close though.  All I have to say is that Ohio needs to change colors from red to blue.

The last few days have been stressful.  Between going to classes, working from 11-8, and writing this design-it-yourself take-home written exam I've been crunching in... I'm amazed I'm still functioning.  Oh wait... that's just me trying to be optimistic.  Seriously though, as soon as I catch a small break in this hectic life I'm living right now?  I am running a bubble bath, lighting some scented candles, locking the bathroom door all so I can soak until my fingers and toes look like raisins while reading a good book that is completely non-educational.

... that just might get the ""best run-on sentence"" award.  Nice.

And yes, I know what you are thinking.  I am just procrastinating and wasting my exam writing time.  And of course you would be exceptionally correct but to tell you the truth?  I really don't want to do this exam anymore.  In my next life I want to have the superhuman power of changing deadlines.  Or eliminating them.  One or the other... I'm not picky.

Anyway.

"event","So yesterday I went to the apple orchard and it was just beautiful.  Very cold, but very beautiful all the same.  The colors of the leaves are just amazing and the apples are delicious.  I definitely enjoyed my time there.  And of course I just had to buy some apple pull-apart and apple cider.  Which I am currently enjoying right now as I type this up.

According to the weatherman a few days ago, there is a chance of flurries today.  (Yeah, so I'm really not up to date on the weather.  So sue me.)  However, this does make me wonder what kind of winter it will be.  Will it be...

 - cold but without a lot of snow?
 - cold with a lot of snow?
 - record breaking freezing without a lot of snow?
 - record breaking freezing with a lot of snow?

Hmmm.  Talk about some fun choices.  If I had my way?  It would be cold with a lot of snow.  My thoughts on that?  If it is going to be cold - I better be able to play in the snow.  It is a give and take scenario, folks.  Give and take.

A 2nd mug of hot apple cider is calling my name.  Unfortunately, my homework is too. Adios."

"event","Changes.

Funny how little changes make a dramatic difference.  I have been going through my share of them and sometimes I really wonder who I am.

Am also beginning to regret a lot of the decisions I have made.  I only wish I knew how to undo them.  To start over.  To erase.

My life still revolves around school and work.  And a meager sampling of what has the potential of being a social life.  However I usually end up deciding that sleep is more important.

I long for the days I slept for at least 10 hours every night.  Now I am lucky if I get more than 6.

I love my hair.  I think the new style definitely suits me.  I thought it would take longer to get used to, but apparently I was wrong.

I wrote a list of my life goals.  Ended up being over 30 goals and I am positive I didn't write them all down.  I am a forgetful person.

It is autumn once again.  I can't wait to wander down to Jordan, MN to the apple orchard... I never grow tired of going. 

My dad is okay.  The cancer scare seems to be taken care of.  In fact, he went out and bought a brand new couch.  One of those micro-fiber ones too.  Oh yeah, watch out world.  

I really need to get to bed.  Brain isn't quite functional anymore and I won't be getting a lot of sleep tomorrow night.  A nap at most.

Life has been interesting as of late.  And not exactly in a good way.

My dad was diagnosed with malignant skin cancer.  The doctors have been removing the malignant cells in hopes of erasing all traces of the cancer.  So far everything is looking good and he will heal from the surgeries without too much difficulty.

But.  And yes, there is always a but when it comes to this stuff.  My dad also has a tumor on his side - a pretty big one at that.  The doctors want to go ahead and remove that but after the whole skin cancer removal surgeries... my dad isn't too keen on going through all of that again.  He seems to think that since the tumor could possibly be benign, it isn't a big deal.  I keep trying to convince him that it is better to be safe than sorry and that he can heal much easier from a routine surgery than he would be able to heal from a malignant tumor that could get out of control.

Hopefully he'll listen to me.  While I sometimes despise what he says and does... I do love him with all my heart.  I only want what is best for him and if that means hounding him from now until forever about getting the tumor removed... so be it.

The tragic beauty of life."

Poor computer.

Life has been hectic though.  I'm working 50-60 hours a week and find myself quite exhausted all of the time.  And the jobs suck major ass.

That's life though, I suppose.

I can't believe that it is August already.  Hasn't time just flown by?  It seems like just yesterday I was hauling my way through inches of snow.  Then again, it could happen!  I do live in the state of MN.  I mean... just this morning I had my heater in the car turned on and by the time my lunch break rolled around... I had the AC going on full blast.

Weather confuses me.  Should've gone to school to become meterologist.  Just because.

The house that my mom, her fiance, my two brothers, a family friend, some slave labor (aka my brother's friends), and myself are building is coming along nicely.  We should be able to move into it around November or so... I'm pretty excited about this.

Though I'm still peeling on my back thanks to that day of roofing.

And although I know this wasn't too big of an update, it will have to do for now.  I'm exhausted and it doesn't help that I probably won't end up getting to bed until midnight... and I work at 7am tomorrow.  Which means I need to leave the house around 6:20am.  Which means I need to set my alarm for 5am.

Which means I will be getting up around 5:30am in a mad panic.  I'm predictable... I know this.

Until next time, adios."

<sup>1</sup> For a healthy person... it takes approximately one hour to get rid of the alcohol from one standard drink.  One standard drink would be 15oz of low-alcohol beer, 10oz of beer, 3.3 oz table wine, 2 oz fortified wines, 1oz of spirits/liqueurs, and 1oz of spirit with a mixer for a mixed drink.  So yeah, basically if you had four 10oz beers and you are a healthy individual... it should only take about 4 hours to get it out of your system.  However, keep in mind other factors such as size, gender, and amount of food in your stomach."

It was an overall crazy night that was entirely way too much fun.  I ended up front and center and the price to pay for having such a good spot isn't too high of a cost while ""in the moment"".  But it sure is hell the day after.  My poor body has bruises all over it and I'm about to go tape up my poor toe (it didn't fare too well... note to self: don't wear open toe shoes to concerts).  

However, the concert was... beyond amazing.  That band really knows how to put on a good show and the light show that accompanied them was terrific.  

I spent the entire night out with friends and woke up this morning in room 118.  So after breakfast at the caf, I slowly made my way back home and now am faced with the daunting task of packing everything up.

Oh, this is not going to be fun.

"event","Well, things are interesting in apartment 302 right now.

No words have been said about last Friday, but you could easily cut the tension with a knife right now.  It has become an uneasy stalemate and although we do the small talking, there is no emotion behind it.  To be honest, I'm waiting for the curtain to fall and for the real show to begin.

Not surprisingly, nobody wants or intends to apologize for their actions and/or behavior.  Everyone thinks that they were right and that the other was wrong and it becomes a vicious cycle of blame.  Truthfully, I doubt there is any solution to our situation that we now find ourselves in.

All I know is that I'm tired of dealing with the constant slights to my integrity, however, for the sake of a semi-peaceful final 2 weeks... I'm going to put aside my pride and just take it.  Though with the way things are going right now, I doubt I'll have to deal with anything.  We barely get past the small talk and frankly?  I hope it stays that way for the rest of our time spent together in this apartment.  I'm not one to put aside my pride and dignity for the sake of pleasing another person.

I am just afraid of the person I could potentially become if this situation turns really ugly.  I know many things about these two girls that they would not want anyone knowing.  One is a girl that lies to her boyfriend and cheats on him as well.  Even though he lives only a few blocks away.  The other has lied so much to her mother that I can't even believe it.  On Friday I was so close to calling up the boyfriend and telling him of his girlfriend's actions, but thankfully I reconsidered.  Who am I to ruin their relationship for the lone reason of revenge?  True... it isn't right what she is doing, but it also isn't my place to bring her behavior to light.

I don't know what to think anymore.  I'm just trying to keep to myself and to my room as much as possible... which isn't all that hard to do right now.  Finals are upon me and I'm under so much stress.  I just keep thinking of how wonderful this summer will be and that it is just around the corner.  Just under 2 weeks of torture left and I'll be free from WSU.  I think, just maybe, that I'll make it.

As for my weekend at home... I'm glad it happened.  I wasn't going to tell the parents that I was home but somehow my mother's intuition had her call me and I just can't lie.  So I figured that my mom knew so I should spend a few hours with her on Saturday... which is just what I did.  That's when I found out that my mother had felt the need to tell my father I was in town.  Yeah, I didn't get to talk or see him until Friday and was reprimanded for the lack of contact.  Gee thanks, mother.

As for the details of my weekend?  That is a story for another time and place.  Like a weekend in May at DQ with my buddy Michelle."

So I called the Cities and currently have someone driving the 2 hours to come pick me up from Winona just so I can <b>get the hell away from here</b>.

I also think that I may just forget having friends that are of the female gender and stick with guys.  Less drama... more fun.  (with a few exceptions and you girls know who you are).

Still must talk to the girls (Bridget, Jess, and Bren) about next year.  I'll probably take care of that tomorrow.

Easter was interesting this year.  I went to a party on Saturday night and ended up quite drunk.  I attempted a drinking game, but gave up after three not-so-successful attempts.  Must try and learn this game when sober.  Anyway, although I didn't get home until about 3:30am, I was up by 8am and at church by 9.  I'm kinda proud of myself on that one.

"event","<b>Chapter One: The Old Man and the Penis</b>
<i>*Note: Similar to The Old Man and the Sea, but without the sea. And not written by the great Ernest Hemingway which I'm sure you would notice by the severe lack in quality.</i>
 
Two of my roommates (Emily and Pants) were walking home from main campus two days ago when an old man (about mid-to-upper 50's) walked past them while going the opposite direction of them.  Emily (the pervert that she is) happened to glance down in the nether regions (hehehehe - nether.  hehehehe) (and yes, I am immature) (and yes, I like parentheses) but anyway.  She looked down at his crotch area and saw that he, in fact, was hanging out there.  Completely.  And then she had eye contact with this old man.  
 
So, seeing how this freaked the hell out of the Emily roommate, she told the Pants roommate to dial 911 and inform them of this freaky penis man.  So they dialed 911 and long-story cut short... the police caught the ""Icky-Old-Penis-Man"" and the girls had to go identify him.  And then he went to jail for indecent exposure and such.
 
Emily claims that she will forever be traumatized by this event and that she will never be able to wash her mind clean of the pointy, wrinkly, ugly looking penis.  Pants swears that she never saw it.
 
<b>Chapter Two: The Perks of Being at Winona</b>
<i>*Note: Similar to The Perks of Being a Wallflower except without the wallflower.  And without the quality writing of Stephen Chbosky.</i>
 
I have now seen a few perks of being at Winona.  See, we don't have the same risk as UW-River Falls these days.  Apparently the university was under a school shooting threat that had a heavy emphasis on recreating the Columbine situation.  The school was under tight security surveillance and on a look out for suspicious behavior.  A few of my friends that go there were quite spooked (as one would expect) but luckily nothing happened yesterday.  (As yesterday was the day the threat said something would happen).  Well, nothing other than a lot of false fire alarms.
 
However, I would take false fire alarms over open bullet fire any day.  Just a personal opinion though.  I'm glad nothing happened, Michelle!
 
<b>Chapter Three: Life of Lindsay</b>
<i>*Note: Similar to Life of Pi, but without the pi and with a Lindsay instead.  But that was pretty self explanatory.  And once again, it is found here without the quality of Yann Martel.  Shame.</i>
 
This one will be a fairly short chapter.  And by short, I mean it will be the longest chapter.  However.  Yesterday I was walking up to the front of class to get back a paper that I had written from my psychology professor.  This would, of course, be occurring with the whole class watching.  Now, normally this would be no problem.  Sure, there was about 150 people in the room, but I can walk.
 
<i>Normally</i> I can walk that is.
 
Instead, I trip over an empty desk.  Therefore, the desk and I decide to have a little russian roulette and we go dancing foot-in-foot to the floor.  And then we decide to do a bit of rolling around with much clanging and yelps to accompany the dance.  We finally end our signature dance routine by banging into the wall where we were abruptly stopped in our tracks.
 
I cannot even begin to describe how red my face became and how much I wanted to become invisible at that exact moment.  Or have all of their memories erased.  One of the two.
 
Instead of becoming invisible or having their minds erased, I quietly got up... took my graded paper from the professor... and went back to my seat.  All while the entire class was laughing and looking at me with my undignified and rather red face.
 
Good thing there is only about a month left of school?"

"event","I really enjoy watching the sunrise and listening to the birds... hearing them call out to the world that morning has come and a new day has begun.  This time of day just inspires me to accomplish what needs to be done and gives me the strength I need to take on the world once again.  One step at a time.

I should do this more often... just for this feeling.  Where I can truly believe that every day is a new day.

I think I'm off to go write some poetry.  It's too beautiful of a morning not to.

"event","Alright.

I have some gift cards to barnes and noble that I most desperately need to spend.  So here is my question to anyone who reads this: <b>what books do you highly recommend?</b>

I'm thinking I will be getting the book ""Life of Pi,"" by Yann Martel... if you've read this, I would greatly appreciate to hear your thoughts on it!  But, as you can probably see, I am in great need of suggestions.

Please please <i>please</i>?

I'm open to anything and everything.  And I know that if I went to barnes and noble I would walk away with my arms completely full of books but I really want just a select few <i>good</i> books.

I'm craving a good book right now like I usually crave chocolate.  Especially since in about a month it will be my summer vacation and I will have more time to read books for pleasure.  Mmmmm.  I can't wait."

"event","Okay, so last night was fun.  The girls and I had a bit too much fun with some grapefruit, spoons, oven mitts, and cameras... but it really took my mind off things which is precisely what I needed.  Still need, actually.

I don't know.  Things are really rough right now and most of my friends understand what is going on.  I'm not willing to publicly display everything right now, so if you don't know what is going on... feel free to IM me sometime, I guess.

Just... it's difficult when you have two people that have two very different coping strategies.  I cope with things by becoming more active and forcing my mind off of the topic.  Usually hanging out with friends and having a good time is what happens.  It doesn't necessarily mean that I'm okay with things and that I'm not hurting... it's just how I cope when things get a bit tough.

I bite the bullet and continue on with life.  In all fairness, I continue on with life a bit more than what I normally would, but that is because I need to.  I need to feel okay.  So I make it a point to do exactly that.

It's probably a very good thing that my brother will be here today.  I am beyond positive that he will keep me moving as he has never been to a college campus before and I plan on showing him around.  Later on, we'll hit the college weekend party scene.  

So life?  Bring on the distractions."

"event","Okay, I need to make a to-do list for today.  Because I am needy and forgetful like that.

- Finish structural formulas
- Go to the library and print off said formulas
- Take a shower and get ready
- Start fixing food around 12:30pm and put the roast in by 1:30pm
- Meeting with Kari - she'll be here around 2:00pm
- Flip roast by 4:00pm
- Study chemistry whenever you can
- Clean the apartment (bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room, entry way, etc)
- Preheat oven for biscuits at 5:30pm
- Girls will arrive around 6:00pm
- Fix green beans and put biscuits in oven around 6pm
- Dinner is served around 6:30pm
- Dessert will be the b-day cake
- Study chemistry some more for the exam tomorrow

Actually, I'm quite excited about tonight.  What with the dinner (roast beef, potatoes, cooked carrots, green beans, biscuits, and b-day cake), the wine, and of course... the company.  True, it's a typical minnesota dinner, but that's alright because I can fix one damn good roast.  If you haven't had it yet?  You'll just have to trust me on it.

Fear my cooking skills.  Or you could just kiss the cook.  I'll leave that for you to decide."

"event","Wow.  This is going to be one busy (but mostly fun) week.

Lemme see here.  Today is kinda boring because I'll basically be studying all day long, but sometimes that is just what you have to do.  You gots to do what you gots to do, right?  

Tomorrow, however, is my special day and although I have a group meeting and my 3 hour night class (with an exam), I can assure you I will have a lot of fun.  Besides, my 3 hour chem lab is CANCELLED!  Hoorah.

Wednesday is kind of boring too.  I'll be studying for my chem exam (which I have on Friday) but!  This Wednesday is the return of my lovely O.C. and I know I will have much fun watching that.  It should be amusing considering that Paris Hilton is going to be going after my boy Seth (supposedly).  Hmmm, I guess I'll just have to watch and find out.

Thursday is going to be an awesome day.  I am hosting a dinner for my most excellent friends (Bren, Jess, Bridget, and Katie) over at my apartment and I'm thinking we will be having a bit of wine with our dinner.  I can't wait because I always have a blast when I'm with those girls.

Friday I have my chem exam, but after I finish that... my brother and his whatever-she-is friend are coming to visit me for Friday and Saturday.  I'm actually really surprised at this because it's Nathan and we don't exactly get along all the time, but lately things have been good.  Not too sure why, but I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.  So basically, I'll be babysitting Nathan and Kim, but hey.  I've never seen him drunk before and therefore it should be interesting.

I have a feeling that Saturday night will be my night for fun.  And Sunday will be my recovery day.  Mainly because once 2pm on Friday rolls around, my two weeks of exam hell are over with!  (for the time being, at least)

Damn.  I'm excited for this week."

Geocities is being kind of fickle this evening, so just in case the text doesn't appear (as it refuses to save for me, but somehow the picture can be viewed) I will write it here as well.

Going L to R we have: Katie, Me, Talia, Lesley, and Ashley.  Good times were had during January 2004 - Winter Break.

I'll have to sit down and actually update this thing when I have some spare time, but let's just say that life is quite complicated right now.  This has definitely been one very interesting month so far.

"event","I was just now reminded of something that happened on Sunday night while watching the academy awards.  And I told myself to remember to put it in my lj.  Well, I remembered!  And only 5 days late, at that.  Not too bad, given my track record. (I swear, I have alzheimers. No joke.)

While watching the academy awards, one of my roommates cries out in disdain, ""... but <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> was such a terrible movie!""

</dramatic pause>

Finding this quite amusing as I absolutely loved the movie and I know a lot of other people were enthralled with it as well, I asked her why she thought it was terrible.  She then proceeded to tell me about how Jack was very unpirate-like and that it was just weird.

</dramatic pause again>

Finding that answer to be quite funny I started laughing and asked how pirates were supposed to act.  She must have found this to be offensive because she became very defensive and said something along the lines of, ""well, not like that.""

Ah, but of course.  Not like that.  Since we all know how pirates act.  Especially in <i>Minnesota</i>.  However, this roommate doesn't take too kindly to being wrong (therefore why try and prove a point when it is near impossible?) so I just leave it at that.  Okay, not really.  I told her how much I enjoyed the film and I don't think that really meant anything to her.  <i>Then</i> I dropped it.

Until she left the room.  I then leaned over to my other roommate and told her to go see it (as she is a silly goon and hasn't seen it yet.  how dare she, I know).  She informed me that, indeed, she was going to see it because everyone else who had seen it only had praise for it.

But hey, what do I know?  Jack doesn't act like a real pirate and the movie is weird.

Too, too funny."

"event","So my <i>spring</i> break starts tomorrow.  A <i>winter</i> storm is also set to roll in tomorrow.  Guess who may not be able to leave Winona until Saturday?  Oh yes, that would be me.

This would fall under the category of a Very Bad Thing.  It is going to rain first and then turn to snow with an accumulation of about 4-8 inches.  So that rain will turn to ice and then the ice will be covered by inches and inches of snow.  I'm sure it is understandable that I'm not too keen on that.

Michelle.  This means that I may not be able to pick you up on Saturday at 9:45am.  I still think that even if I'm not able to be there, you should go.  Just go to RHS over at the athletic doors and go down to the auxillary gym.  I'm sure you remember Jason and you may remember Rachel.  Jason will be more than happy to help you out, as will Rachel.  It won't be a big deal at all and although I wish I could be there, I may not be.

I don't have any calling card minutes, so I can't give you a call.  But let's say this: if I call you, I'll be picking you up because I will be calling you from my dad's/mom's house (one of the two).  If you don't get a call by 9:30am on Saturday?  Just go without me because it means I'm still in Winona.  Or else we'll see each other online?  One of the two.

Snow, oh snow.  Why must you torment me?  You are lovely in the beginning of winter and when there is someone around me that actually appreciates you, but right now?  You are being quite mean and I want you to begone.

I'm crossing my fingers that this winter storm won't happen."

"event","So this past weekend we had temperatures in the 50's.  Shorts weather.  Ladies and gentleman?  I was walking around in a tank top, jeans, and flip-flops.  It was heavenly <b>warm</b> weather.

It has been progressively getting colder this past week, but I didn't think much of it.  Today I went to class with a t-shirt, jeans, and flip-flops (with my spring jacket).

It is now snowing.

My toes are frozen thanks to those flip-flops.

I think I may have to have a word with that groundhog.  He said that we were going to have an early spring and gosh darnit.  I want my spring break to be spring-like.  Is that <i>really</i> too much to ask?  I didn't think so either.

Jack Frost is certainly not my friend at the moment.  Though my Calvin and Hobbes icon is appropriate once again.  So yay?"

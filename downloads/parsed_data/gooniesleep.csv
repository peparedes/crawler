So It was to much to handle so me and HEctor aren't talkin right now.... I Kinda Feel like i've lost a friend.... but i shouldn't really be talkin about that situation here because it just not a problem between me and him but a few other people 2 and we should just let this die now!

Besides that i Also Feel like i have been LEttin People Down... and thats never good....Because i know that These people really care about me... and im not suppose to treat those kind of people that way....Its just that i've been way to stessed to really talk 2 anyone ... or about ne-thing...

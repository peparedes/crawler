soooooooooo...during the hurricane i drove 15 minutes to bethany's house. i wasnt there 2 min. and the power went out at her house.good thing it was only out for 20 min. later me and bethany watched lover come back and the mask of zorro. then yesterday i came back home and stalled reading christianity and the constitution. then i went to band practice. that was fun. then me and bethany went to the subway on lorna road. if u dont know where that is it is where all of the mexicans live but that was not really our problem last night. there was some like 30 year old geeky looking person who like STARED at bethany for FOREVER. she was starting to get worried and then i think he took a picture of her on his phone. i thought it was kinda funny, but still scary. then we went to walmart and i bought nail polish. then we went to ashley's house for a little while.

...the only reason i tell u of the boring events that have happened over the past days is to try and waste as much time as possible. i REALLY DO NOT WANT to read christianity and the constitution. at all. i am using this to stall.(haha that rhymed) ok welli guess ill go
love paige:)
  (sorry to waste your time with this boring update)
p.s. o yeah...i made a 26 on the act ifanyone wanted to know"

soo im back from mississippi. we came home early because of the hurricane. NOTHING interesting happened. nothing interesting ever really does happen. well, i take that back. my grandmother was kind of interesting this weekend. she got really into the movie what a girl wants. like really into it. me and my dad laughed about that for a long time. also i learned that my grandmother didnt know how to say massachusetts (did i spell that right?) she said "" massatushis"" that was funny. she didnt believe that me and my dad said it right so she went and got the dictionary.   on another note i named my grondmother's new kitten Diego after my Cuban soulmate Diego Luna...that is somewhat interesting.
ne ways, i came back sick (like i always do) and dont feel so swell right now so im going to go take a nice nap and start  CHRISTIANITY AND THE CONSTITUTION. sounds fun doesnt it?
ok, bye

so in case anyone was wondering i am having a fantastic summer so far. too bad my lazy days will end july 15.
the rest of my summer consists of a guard retreat, then missions trip, then pre-camp, then band camp, then practice practice practice.

to clarify for church buddies, i have decided to only update for the sake of telling school people what on earth is going on in my life. i have decided to keep as many"" emotions"" out of it as possible. i am trying to keep it to events and stupid quiz thing s such as the following...(if some one is wondering why on earth i stated the above it is because of something that happened earlier this summer. )....ne ways here is the stupid quiz thing i promised....

Being born on the 21st day of the month (3 energy) is likely to add a good bit of vitality to your life. 

The energy of 3 allows you bounce back rapidly from setbacks, physical or mental. 

There is a restlessness in your nature, but you seem to be able to portray an easygoing, ""couldn't care less"" attitude.



You have a natural ability to express yourself in public, and you always make a very good impression. 

Good with words, you excel in writing, speaking, and possibly singing. 

You are energetic and always a good conversationalist. 



You have a keen imagination, but you tend to scatter your energies and become involved with too may superficial matters. 

Your mind is practical and rational despite this tendency to jump about. 

You are affectionate and loving, but very sensitive. 

You are subject to rapid ups and downs.</td>

"event","ok...so lately there has been some ""drama"" between my friends. i you dont know what i am talking about then dont worry because this doesnt apply to u. neways it has made me soo sad and frustrated lately that i cant ""fix"" some of these problems  b/c i like to fix things that are wrong. i figured the only one who could solve this was God so i went to him. i looked up the words ""friends"" and 'gossip"" in  my ""spiffy"" (hehe) new bible and i found these passages. they really helped me so i am putting them so that maybe they can help us as a group of friends.

Friends:
proverbs 17:17a- A friend loves at all times.- that kinda speaks for its self
proverbs 1824- One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer  than a   borther. - i want yall to concentrate on the first part of that. if we all betray eachother then we will all fall to pieces.
proverbs 27:6a- wounds from a friend can be trusted...-if i tell you something along the lines  of constuctive criticism then i am not saying them to be mean, i am trying to help. if i have ever said anything that hurt anyones feelings then tell me. i want to see how you saw it, learn  from my mistake and apologize for it. i dont want it to stay there and ""ferment""hate (for lack of a better term)


Gossip:
proverbs 16:28- the perverse stir up dissension, and GOSSIPS separate close FRIENDS.- this problem i s destroying us. everyone of us is guilty including me. i am calling us out on this one b/c we have to do better with this or else it will never be solved.
proverbs 26:20- wihtout wood a fire goes out; without goddip a quarrel dies out.
ok...im done with that rabbit hole.

ne ways...i LOVE all of yall with all my heart and i would do anything for any of yall. if yall have a problem with me or this tell me and i want to wor k it out.

love forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

You Know You're From Alabama When...


You have a party or a barbeque whenever Alabama plays Auburn in football.

You go to Gulf Shores every summer.

You call the Atlanta Braves baseball team ""us"" like they're actually from Alabama.

You would much rather visit Florida than California.

You don't ""take"", you ""carry"" or ""tote""... as in ""You want me to carry you down to the 7-11?""

A soft drink isn't soda, cola, or pop, it's Coke.

You call it a ""buggy"" and not a shopping cart.

You've said ""fixin' to,"" ""might could,"" or ""usetacould"" during the last week.

Someone you know has used a football schedule to plan their wedding date.

You know the meaning of the phrase ""Fobbed again.""

You can properly pronounce Eufaula, Opelika, Bayou La Batre, and Oneonta.

The Talladega 500 is the biggest sporting event of any sort during the entire year.

You know exactly what chitlins and mountain oysters are, and you know someone who eats them anyway.

You think that people who complain about the humidity in other states are sissies.

You aren't surprised to find rental movies, groceries, ammunition and bait all in the same store.

You've missed a wedding or a funeral to go to a football game.

Asian food is always ""CHINESE"" regardless of the fact that it may actually be Korean or Japanese or Thai

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends from Alabama."

lifted me out of the slimy pit , out of the mud and mire; HE set my
feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. He put a new song in
my mouth , a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put
their trust in the Lord<br>

"event","i finally got an easter dress!
yay me. it is SOO cute.  i love it. it reminds me of amanda. 
ne ways, today was pretty good. i had to go and sing at this easter egg thing at church. it was fun with all of the kids. then i went to a guard practice. it was fun, except my feet started to hurt. o m goodness. i drove on the interstate and on 280 for the first time today. it was really fun. i also made pancakes. they were sooo good. the definate highlight of my day was the whole dress thing. it is black with beige lilys. it is strapless but i have a beige sweater to go over it. it is SOO cute. it looks kinda 50's is. ne ways, i guess ill go now. bye yall, love paige

"event","i got the pleasure (not really) to get to practice drama today. i had to get up at 9a.m.,yes,9!. and on a holiday!:( ne ways, we had practice until 3. at 3 i had ensemble. it ended at 4. at 4 i had choir. it ended at like 5. at 5 , i had to go do drama ...AGAIN! i finally got to go home. i have just been sitting here ever since.im so exhausted. i want to get to bed.

i also got to practice another sort a ""drama"" today. it was such a stupid girl fight. one girl was complaining about having to buy a hair piece for a drama performance.(kinda like our guard ones.) ne ways, she called this other girl a control freak and a spoiled brat. what was worse was a mom got involved.im just glad i was on the other side of the room.

my point of this long story is to complain about getting up early(:(),and to complain about how emotional girls can get. especially about stupid stuff. y should anyone get so riled up about a hairpiece. its a stupid hair piece. in the long run...it dont matter.

anyways, i have "" vented"" (haha kat), and i feel a lot better. one good thing about today is that i didnt have to go to school. even drama practice can b better than school. its not that i hate school, its just that im lazy and dont like doing work. i guess ill go now. bye bye, love yall

love paige :)

"event","hey everybody! guess what... we finished filming our stupid history video thing. that man frustrates me. thats all im going to say. ne ways, we are done, well , sort of. im so excited. i hate doing those things. they take up way too much time. i think the only reason why teachers  make us do them is because they hate grading papers. o'well. were done!!!:)
     i have had way too much to do lately. im just glad to not be quite so busy.
     guard tryouts are next week and the next.im excited but kind of nervous at the same time. i hope i can still do all of the moves and stuff. 
     church was kind of weird tonight. we just prayed for one of our leaders , john abernathy, and his dad. john's mom died a few   
days ago. its weird how it seems like bad things always happen to the good people, and  the not so good people usually get what they want. i guess we just have to trust in God and what HE is doing. 
     i have had to learn that lesson alot lately. every time i try do do something myself...it all falls into a bizillion little pieces. then i give someting totally to God, and it all kind of works out. i guess thats why He is God and im not.
     moving on, well , im kinda out of things to say so im gonna leave. hey kat ( i figured u might be reading this)
     o yeah, the band trip  was incredibly fun. talk some more later. bye bye

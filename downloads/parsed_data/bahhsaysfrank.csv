"event","Wow.  Lots of stuff has happened recently.  But i haven't been able to get online cuz ""The AIM service could not be reached.""  Anyway, on Friday, i was at a sleepover with a few people.  We watched part of the 6th Sense, but by the middle, we were all so freaked out that we had to stop it. (i finished it all by myself last night - AHH!!!! it was soo freaky.  Dead people scare me a lot.)  and then, the next day, we went to Michelle's bat mitzvah.  it was looong. and then her party...Israeli (sp?) folk dancing...then, all the ""Hot Box"" girls from the play had to perform that song that we did for the play.  it sorta sucked.  anyway, then today, i went out and got some stuff for camp and some new CDs.  whoot!!"

"event","Today wasn't bad.  Well, with all things considered, it wasn't bad, i guess. I went to lunch with the family...and the Carlson's.  As in the Kate Carlson who'll be going to Waring this year.  It could've been worse i guess... Oh, and i saw Gerred Clarke working there too.  Anyway, i was able to get out of lunch a few hours early, and just walk into town.  I went to Zak's, Richdale's, and my old school, which was pretty cool.  i went on the swings, and just checked out the perimeter around the school, since i really haven't seen it for two years.  It was fun.  Then i walked home, where i saw Jen Bishop driving by - that was pretty cool, since i haven't seen her in like, 2 years either lol.  Oh! and finally the most exciting part of my day - i lost i tooth!! whoot!! now, about 7 left to go...i am soo jealous of everyone else, cuz everyone else have ALL LOST ALL OF THEIR BABY TEETH! Damn it. so, that was my day.  and plzplzplz IM me if you can read this, cuz i'm worried that my journal might not be working..."

"event","Today was truly the most BORING day of my life.  I am quite serious.  See, my parents left around 1000 with my sis for her little league game, (i woke up about 15 min. later), and came back around 400, leaving me w.o transportation or food for the entire day.  So, i mostly sat around the house, went outside for a while (i used the basketball hoop that i have in my yard - it brought back manymanymany unpleasant memories of bball at Waring...) and that was pretty much my day.  Hopefully it won't be the same tomorrow."

"event","Hey! well, this is the first entry in my journal, so i'm hoping that it works.  anyway, right now, i am Home Alone (are my parents dumb or WHAT?!) and tomorrow is the last day of school. A bit on the depressing side really, cuz this is the first school year that I've actually liked - I'm serious. B/c despite all the bad times, it was still fun. (not the actual bad times, obviously - i mean the aftermath of them. oi, i am confusing. and hyper).  And now it's over.  And then, on June 30th, off to camp in VT.  And i'm gonna be gone for 7 WEEKS!! ah well.  anyway, now my parents are home, and are kicking me off the comp.  Typico.  So later on, call or IM me and tell me what you think of my new journal:-p."

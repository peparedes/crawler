"event","i just wanted to share these lyrics with the few who still read this it's a song called The Shame by The Blood Brothers a coheed/scremo mix and i really like this song and love the lyrics not much is new in life...enjoy the lyrics feel free to tell me what you think. i think theyre beautiful in a twisted way haha

My heart is a black haunted loom, weaving jackets for children who'll never be born.
My hands are abandoned factories manufacturing heartbreak and hate for the world.
As we waltz the broke dance of our limbs, this ballroom has been groped by so many evil whims.
As I drill the last hole into you, the wall of your body has hardened into glue.
Everything is going to be just awful when we're around.
All the color's gonna rot off your sight when we're around.
I remember the day that I sold my smile to that nice couple who lost their first child.
I threw in a set of sympathy, and a bucket of popcorn for the cemetery.
But now my face is all fenced off, the sky is boarded up, the hills covered in drop cloth.
How many chords till this song vomits out real love?
How many feathers to pluck naked the soiled dove?
How many whores till you send away for that trophy?
And how many punches till you give yourself away for free?
Because those bruises on your face look like the sun selling in disgrace.
(From these cliffs you can see the whole city laid out groveling like a field of wounded soldiers.
The billboards in heat and hissing, the sky scrappers stitching the gash of the earth.
As they waltz the broken dance of their limbs their ballroom has been groped by so many evil whims).
Everything is going to be just awful when we're around.
All the color's gonna rot off your sight when we're around.
I am just a salesman, pleased to meet you, can I show you around.
Everything must go, the shadows, the seagulls, when we're around.
This is our shame.

"event","Well it has been quite a while since ive updated here but i figured i needed to do something other than watch bad hbo family movies at three in the morning about kids saving schools held hostage i mean one if your school was taken over would you really try and stop it? no. youd let it get blown to hell so you dont have to go.  anyway i have a lab practical in bio tomorrow so i should do well now that ive figure the easiest way to remember is hypo always flows to hyper and for those of you who dont know what i am talking about you sure are lucky.  the new abberations set for a minis game i play is released today so i get my 2 cases in a little over 12 hours... you can tell im excited.  it was my birthday present from my dad.  school is going well. it's rather easy but then again it's thirteenth grade. i spend most of my days with michael at the game haven now so i nerd out a lot.were going down to states on my birthday the 23rd wink wink for magic down in richmond. a great present for me a nice two and a half hour drive down and possibly back up depending on whether or not were staying at jasons sisters.well i havent see much of anyone else lately. i miss arin and mary alot :-( but i should be meeting up with each of them sometime soon id suppose.  Im not sure about much else right now.  i should be getting a new job at dominos as a driver soon.  im not sure how i feel about that. it's cash in pocket but its a dominos driver. money is money though i suppose. i actually like school now. psychology is amazing. aside from stephanie and my jokes about everyone in our head being a drug addict, it intrests me greatly.  that and of course history. everything else is pretty lame i tested out of english and i think im dropping econ because i dont have the effort or motivation right now it takes to get an A in the class. i got a B on my first test but... i have never been one to try hard haha. i also hung out with lia the other day. even though it was only 15 minutes it was refreshing. i miss talking to her and just being somewhat goofy but having her to talk to about serious things is nice too. even though she didnt give me much advice i feel with her i have some weird understanding like just talking to her alliviates my issues. its nice because shes one of the few people i feel like that about. im also thinking about taking the summer off instead of attending school to get done sooner to go work at church camp again. i love it down there and i feel like i need something to get God more involved in my life because i seem to be losing things there a little. and now as im sure you all know my take on politics and the debates. im not sure how i feel about kerry at this point. i just know im not voting for bush. aside from the jokes about kerry looking like tree beard from lord of the rings, i will probably vote for him.im not sure how much longer i can tolerate american politics. i just realized the other day why it bothers me. religion has no place in politics.the seperation of church and state goes both ways and americans are the only ones who dont realize that. i am against abortion because of my religion. but i realize socially to make it illegal would be silly. you would have unhealthy abortions in alleys etc i would not want my wife/friend/whomever to have an abortion but it is their choice. personally im not going to have the problem because im not knocking anyone up unless im ready to have the child. i think maybe im coping out but i have my belief but realize the importance of the choice for sake of everyones safety. but i also dont say liberals who do it are going to hell. george bush is running on the idea of Jesus being his homeboy...need i say more? i believe in Jesus but i am detested by school prayer and what bush is trying to do. it's bad enough the only catholic president we had was killed early on. well enough ranting on worthless subjects iron chef is on so i must away...laters"

American politics are like a joke with no punchline. everyone laughs but no one really gets it. i guess youre better than people who say politics dont concern them...and to your democrats/republicans...aka stupid idiots in the middle that want to pretend theyre conservative and liberal there are no politics to starving...wake up and fucking do something with your life and mine other than argue about which president smoked the most dope in high school or which one dodged the war...and you wonder why people want to kill everyone in our nation? its because they all think were like you...we need a new for of society that isnt MILDLY RETARDED. you know the difference between Castro, Moa Ze Dong, Hiltler and you all? they were acttualy trying to help someone other than themseleves with their ""brutal tyranny."" now whos the brutal ones? the one helping a nation or the ones helping themselves? grow up"

inside this crowd 


and you're surrounded by the lives 
of those who found something to hold 
so bringing everybody down 
is all you know 


you've been hiding so long you can't find yourself 
in this sheltered life you live 
when everything you want is at your fingertips 
you'll never know what need is 


you're claiming to be something different 
so wanting to believe 
that you're better than the rest
to make up for your self-esteem 
you talk to hear your own voice and 
you've left me no choice but to choose 
I miss the person that you were 
but I don't miss you 


you're the new revolution
the angst-filled adolescent 
you fit the stereotype well 

Six Ways till Sunday -Rise Against

you had everything you will ever want for the rest of you life and how will it make you feel to realize you threw it all away? fuck how this world turns out....bed people never get cancer or hurt...its always the ones who dont deserve it...sorry bren"

"event","this is just my random act of violence...i cant stand the fact that all these wussy bands want to call themselves punk and thats what ruins the ""punk"" scene...these followers think that they are so punk rock for liking simple plan new found glory and the like sorry if this offends you but i dont care now maybe this makes me so unpunk to say these bands arent...but if theyre punk then i wanna be preppy...take your whiney generic <insert name here> band...now yes im not in a band so i cant criticize their playing i mean NFG dont play poorly but i mean damn they are far from what the scene started off as...now i know things ""evolve"" but honestly...if johnny rotten and sid vicious (forgive the generic names but its so you can all relate) saw what it has become i can safely say they would have tried to od a little bit harder...now granted i like third eye blind does that mean they are punk? noooo just because i think im punk (which i dont im using it as an example) every band i like doesnt have to be punk rawk lol honestly i like some ""punk"" music i like some softer music i like some classical music that doesnt mean im still not myself...its not cool to be a ""punk"" it never was..at first it was poor and dirty and no where else to go but now its conformity and thats worse than before...im not bringing down these bands as talented to each his own but kenny g the sax player isnt rap so stop pretending the all american rejects and good char are punk rock....when did punk rock become so lame?on another note...read some books people to enlighten your minds anything by chomsky and a book called Econnomic Theory and Operations analysis...it might help you understand why i dislike capitalism...it give an unbiased view of all economic theories and Manufacturing Consent its about medias corruption and how our government inenvertenly controls it...goodnight you punk rawkers see you in the simple plan pit...laters"

I was golden on D but as soon as i went up to offense....haha well fat kids dont play up top for a reason.Walker got into a huge scuffle with Dowery and it escalated to pushing...well later i got talked to by Mr. Joyner and Coach Hill about what happened and i told them i really didnt see much but they both looked like they got carried away and walker was way out of line. well then they accidently called me to the office because they wanted to talk about what happened but didnt cancel the announcement to call me down because they had already talked to me.well on my way down i heard someone yell hey chris wait up and i see sarah bandyke skipping up to me. and we walked and talked about the incident the rest of the way to the office.i was suprised because the want of every school boys desires was talking to me..now sarah and i have talked online but never really in person.at any rate she seemed nice enough to me and plus i think shes cute but its like almost a hollywood thing where even if i did want her, which i dont but i can see why people do, it would never happen. so they told us they called me and sarah by accident and we walked together most of the way back to class. she was really nice and it made me feel ten times better about myself even though it doesnt mean much of anything.well then me and em hung out went to circut city with erin her sis and she got her dads fathers day present. she got called to go in and gaurd some schedule mix up...so at five thirty she came over. me and brendan went to books a million and played chess for about two hours just talking and stuff and then we went home oh yeah before that we went to the mall...shocker.well and now the best...i went to dinner with em at cork street tavern...we sat next to sally steiball and i then realized how much i love emily and being with her...because even some sterotyical hottie like sally couldnt draw my attention from emily...i was like entranced and found her utterly gorgeous...it only makes me worry more about how much i will miss her at Radford...more to come on that situation with time...well im off to dream of her...Laters"

Im a little bummed i wont have time for the ballet recital today b/c i really like ballet. well hats off to everyone in the recital except krooked kankles it was very entertaining but who wouldnt be entertained by hot girls in skimpy clothes prancing around? well maybe a gay guy but what can you do?well after that me and brendan hung out at wendys for way to long haha and saw dasterly dan and his gf at circut city where we pestered the workers there for a bit...went back to wendys and talked about stupid things and some meaningful ones...we went our seperate ways and i came home to talk to em for half an hour.then went to sleep because i felt like crap for some reason...and now im sitting here about to make the transition to todays oncomings *Pause* At one i have to go pick up the floral arrangement things for prom tonight...im really stoked yet very anxious...i have always wanted to goto a dance with emily since ive known her and now i get to...and plus things have been wonderful lately so im worried that im going to screw things up somehow...well after that we are going to get her hair done at bubbles my fav mall hang out spot next to hot tizzinopic and pretzel time....i think i stole hot tizzinopic from brendan...oh well haha we have been hanging out more frequently which is great because he is down to earth and knows whats going on. I enjoy when we hang out immensely...then me and em and shannon and nick are meeting up at continental for din din yummy...and then to prom..after that it is unclear..i am going to ihop with brendan and lisa and leigh anne and cassie and thats the only for sure thing..em may be coming which would be cool maybe JR and mandee maybe nick and shannon maybe the girls' dates...either way it seems promising...well i suppose i need to shower up and what not get ready to pick em up so in the infamous words of the giddy me last night...get off your nose and stop blowing my wallet...random...random...well keep it real and keep it safe tonight kiddies...laters"

Let's see. 

I'm excited because I have enough credits to actually graduate. Yay!

Just want to say happy New Year to all y'all.

It's been quite the year.

Made the Varsity team on golf.
Had a good Christmas, got lot's of money.

Also, I am taken! In case some of you haven't heard or haven't noticed, I have a boyfriend. The best thing that could happen to me this year. I am dating Sam Lingafelter of whom some of you know. He's a really great guy, very sweet. 

Well I hope you all are doing well, and I hope to see you all in the year 2008!

Lots of Love,

Courtney"

"event","Okay, so I was gonna wait until I got my school schedule to post here and just have a big long post but since they aren't mailing us our schedules it defeats the whole purpose, because I imagine I will be meeting up with you guys on Raider Day.<br /><br />So here goes a big long update of my summer.<br /><br />First off, it started normal, you know sleeping in until whenever I felt like getting out of bed, not dressing if I was just staying at home, and possibly going to the mall on occasion. <br /><br />Well, then my gramma broke her nose. Yeah, she turned into a tropical bird, many different colors... here's how that happened, she was at UPS store in Northgate, they had just repaved their sidewalk and parking lot, so there were no lines and the sidewalk looked just like the parking lot and she tripped and fell... major face plant. She's all better now.<br /><br />Then it turned gross. You all remember my post about my dog Thor right? Well my dad and Sandra (if there is a God, may he/she bless them) got me a very last minute ticket to Vegas, which quelled my fear of not being able to say goodbye to him. I was able to say goodbye just as he was.... sorry, getting a little teary eyed... just as he was put to sleep. I will never forget the look on his face as he passed on. It still haunts my dreams. But he's in a better place. We brought his ashes home the day before I left and I should be getting pictures of him (when he was healthy) very soon.<br /><br />So then my summer went back to normal for the most part. Then there were some birthdays, and we had lots of fun. Good times. And just last Tuesday, my Uncle Tommy had been in town and was here for meetings and such with Nestle, whom he works for. They were up in Carnation. Well, they were playing a game of kickball, and my uncle got kneed in the face, and now has a facial fracture. So now he's going back to California tomorrow to get surgery where he might have to have a plate put in his face and he has to get reconstructive surgery. So that was exciting. Of course he didn't turn a bunch of colors like my gramma but that probably for the best. <br /><br />And now I'm playing golf for the school team, which is a lot of fun, because I get to know a few of the freshman that are coming to the school, and some of them a pretty cool. <br /><br />So yea, that's been my summer in a nutshell... a really big nutshell.<br /><br />Hope y'all are good and can't wait to see you at Raider Day. Let me know when you guys are gonna be down at the school and I'll try and be down there at the same time. Who cares about the school's schedule for when we have to be down there.<br /><br />Later.<br /><br />Courtney<br />P.S. My user icon is flippin' awesome. You have to watch it all the way through.<br /><br /><br /><i>This post is in loving memory of Sir Thawr Farrell. June 2, 1996 - July 13, 2007. May he rest in peace, in that doggy heaven.</i>"

"event","If you haven't heard from me, then it's time I told you. My beloved dog, Thor, will soon be put to rest. For those who don't know him, he was a friend, a brother, and a guardian. He was one of my best friends in the whole world. Thor was diagnosed with cancer about a week and a half ago, it has moved from the chest to his brain. He is now blind and deaf, and can hardly move at all. He had a stroke just yesterday and my step-dad Dan has decided to put him down instead of have him living the rest of him life like this, he will be put down on Tuesday. 

Tonight I fly down there to see him and say goodbye. I've never be this upset in all my life, Thor has always been there for me, he's shown compassion and love unlike any other animal I've seen or had before. 

Thor you will be missed. I love you.

"event","So yeah, haven't posted in awhile but as some know, these past few weeks have been mighty stressful. So I got my haircut yesterday. I'll try and post a pic of it. Video Quilt Project = Worst thing to ever exist. Especially when working with people you really can't put your trust in. But my group is finally almost done.

Been trying to get a relationship going. But it's like answering an SAT question where you have mulitple choice and you need to narrow down your answer to one. Which I've almost got done. 
1. He doesn't have a girlfriend. Check
2. He likes me, as a friend as far as I know. Somewhat Check.
3. Told him I would need a massage by the end of the school year (which is true) and he offered to give me one. Check.
4. He got a great sense of humor. Check.
So I've almost got it. I'll probably mention to him that I like him when I feel confident that he really likes me, closer to the end of the year. 

Another good thing is that I should have a job in the mall for over the summer. Either in Clarie's, The Body Shop or Fuego. So crossing my fingers for that. 

And finally, by the end of the summer I should have my own car! One of the best pieces of news so far.

Well talk to ya all later.

"event","Well here's a place that looks familiar... I know I haven't posted in awhile but I've been busy.

First off I was at my mom's all Spring Break, and didn't want to post anything there cause a bratty, nit-wit of a child was there. My mom's boyfriend's daughter Patti. I don't feel like explaining about her cause it'll just make me angry.

Then when I got back I had to take the freakin' WASL, which by the way, we officially DON'T have to pass. 

And then after that I had my Aunt Cathy, Uncle Tommy and cousins Ashley-Jo and Benjamin up here from Southern Cali. and it was awesome, except for the part where I had to help my grandma babysit the cousins and when we were leaving my cousin Ashley-Jo started to cry because she thought she wasn't going to see me again. It was very sad.

And then after that, my parents left for Hawaii and on that first Friday they were gone my step-siblings Sean, Meaghan and Michael decided to throw a party a Junior Spodie( a mix of Vodka, 7-up, fruit juice and chunks of fruit) party, but I took refuge at Patricia's place (my savior!) and they all got caught 'cause my grandma came home from the East Coast that night and saw some drunk person leaving our house and called our parents. 

And finally last night I went and saw the musical! Very funny, very awesome. But when I came home all was fine until about 10 O'Clock when about 20 different people from our school started showing up and a party was goin' on. But Meaghan didn't think that would happen 'cause all she did was bring her best friend and her best friend's boyfriend over and then Sean came home with beer and masses of people. Surprisingly enough I was able to still get a somewhat decent amount of sleep 'cause I ended up falling asleep when the party was still going on.

And that, my friends, has been my past month. Of couse I did get my license and was able to drive the car while the parents were out of state. 

Aight, talk to ya all later, I guess... I'm going back to bed....

She was saying stuff like "" That's fine if you NEVER want to come and visit AGAIN..."" and "" I can see that you dad has finally taken control of your life..."" 

1st- this didn't make me in the least upset. I don't care what she thinks. 

2nd- I got a letter from my grandmother(her mom) and it said that she has disowned my mother and is never speaking to her again. I say YAY GRANDMA! 

So my mother I guess has chosen her boyfriend over her own daughter... whatever, I'm tired of trying to help her out of the horrible situations she gets into. And when he cheats on her again and comes to me for help... I'm just going to say, "" Screw you, you never helped me.""

So my life once again is wonderful... except for the fact that my friend are having problems, and I just have to say that I'm sorry that you are having trouble you can always talk to me.

But it doesn't really matter anymore because, the only car I can drive is my dad's car, and he needs it to get to work. The Ford Focus that my older step-brother Micheal won't pay for two blown pistons in the engine and of course the parents won't pay for it because Micheal has been getting a free ride with it, meaning that he hasn't had to pay for anything but gas for the car.

I think he deserves it, but it puts Meaghan and I into a tight spot because neither of us has a car to drive and she's taking the driving test on Nov. 2.

And her dad is getting her a car. Lucky her.

While you're not sarcastic at all times, you definitely have a cynical edge.
In your opinion, not all people are annoying. Some are dead!
And although you do have your genuine moments, you can't help getting your zingers in.
Some people might be a little hurt by your sarcasm, but it's more likely they think you're hilarious.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howsarcasticareyouquiz/"">How Sarcastic Are You?</a></div>"

Also my mom won't buy me anything, like clothes for the new school year, supplies nothing. Everytime I ask her for some clothing she just says, "" That's what I pay your dad child support for."" Who f-ing cares!? She's my mother and should buy me some things! My aunt was at least kind enough to but me a new backpack and new school supplies. 

This is also the time where my mom gets very irritable whenever I mention you guys or anything that has to do with going home because she hates it when I leave and that I am actually looking foreward to it. But I can't help it, I'm stuck inside all day with nothing to do! What else am I suppose to talk about?

Harmony, you need to check your e-mail if you haven't yet! I sent you somthing for your birthday. I also have a few gifts for you, I just hope you like them. Also I was wondering if I could have permission to use your name in the book I'm writing?

Has anybody worked on the History paper that's due when school starts? I haven't even written a page! 

Okay I'm done ranting. See you all soon!

"event","Yeah so I'm not the biggest fan of baseball but when I went last night it was pretty interesting because 
1. The teams had funny names. It was the Las Vegas Area 51's vs. Portland Beavers ( who we rooted for)
2. The 51's mascot looks like a grey Jar-Jar Binks from StarWars. His name is Cosmos.
3. I learned that the 51's are the AAA team for the Dodgers and the Beavers are the AAA team for the San Diego team that I can't remember the name too ( told you I wasn't the biggest fan of baseball, now I can't remember team names)

And lastly,

I watched Sergio Garcia play last night. He plays for the Dodgers but was suspended for 15 games for drug abuse, which means he got demoted for the time being.

I also had two big things of shaved ice with watermelon syrup and I was really hyper at the game. I don't think I had ever had that much sugar in my life.

On another note, has anybody been watching the news about the JonBenet Ramsey case? I think it's taken them too long to arrest someone but I think they should have arrested the parents (before the mother died) because I think they had something to do with it. I think they hired the guy that was arrested to kill their daughter, why? I wouldn't know but still...

Well I hope to meet up with you all on Raider Day... where and when are we meeting? Is it the lunchroom or what?"

"event","Well another story from Hell.

It's pretty cold here for Vegas, it's only getting to 100 degrees, but now it's all humidity, but that's cold here. We had this humungo lightening and rain storm. We're under a three day flash flood warning which is very scary because when we have floods nobody can go any where and there are fires because of the lightening. 

I sat out on my balcony yesterday and watched the lightening, but it was really weird because there was no thunder and the lightening was really close. We didn't have any rain in our area but it was still close to us. The lightening would cause high winds and there was a giant dustdevil that went through our apartment complex and it took a lot of water to get the dirt out of my eyes. 

My cousin called me from the east coast, he's never been over that way so he's really excited. He's visiting out Uncle Tracey and my uncle (in the background, I could hear him talking) tells my cousin 'Kevin tell her about your swimming pool adventure' and Kevin(my cousin) starts laughing and told me this story that he and our uncle were swimming and Kevin and him were playing Shark(don't ask, family thing) and Kevin bit our uncle on the butt. My uncle was cracking up in the background.

Well not much else. I'll probably call or e-mail soon, cause I'm getting bored. Or you all could call me on my cell phone. I really need someone to talk to.

Later. Much.

Miss you all,
Courtney"

Don't be afraid to call or e-mail at anytime, even if it's 3 in the morning, cause I'll probably be up doing something or other. 

Even though I don't get to see you all during the summer, I can't wait until next year to see you guys again. So I leave you all with this little token as I say goodbye, and until we talk or see each other again.

First off, my mother's boyfriend( the loser he may be) Dan, has been cheating on her. We have proof, and plenty of it. Now this has been going on for awhile but my mom can't afford to move out, nor to evict him. But she sure has hell has been packing his shit. We call this women who he's been cheating on the Shkank( you have to say it like it is). My mother has been raiding Dan's bank accounts for all the money he has, which of course there isn't much. And just short time ago she was going through his pants pockets and found the Shkank's license. Now this is where it get's fun. Dan was running around the house saying ' oh shit, oh shit, oh shit' which is pretty normal anyway. But then my mom took the license to work and SHREDDED IT. Now the little bitch who isn't even 21 (and Dan's 40) doesn't have a license. 

Dan will really be hearing from me very soon and trust me, it's going to be a summer I'll never forget.

"event","Look I have A Live Journal Account! *Jumps happily* Anyway, been working madly on my fanfiction's stories. Currently working on three that are the most popular, they are: Alia's return, First Year at Hogwarts and Her Secret Life. They all include the YuYu Hakusho characters.

Good stories. Alia's Return is a sequel to another story called Remember Me. It's about one of my demon sides Alia, and her friends meeting up the YuYu Hakusho gang and becoming a part of their team. they make friends and fall in love. 

Her Secret Life is about another demon side of mine Kimiko, replaces the YuYu gang and her quest to find true love and new friends.

First Year at Hogwarts features my third demon side(I have four) Kyoko and the YuYu gang going to Hogwarts, her life seems to be matching Harry's life a bit in certain ways.

There are a few more that I am working on but people want these the most. You can read these at www.fanfiction.net/~picesaquarius

School can be a borefest, in World History if we could watch Monty Python we would probably have WAY more fun learning about history in a semi-historical way.

Yeah well got to go. 

Later. Much."

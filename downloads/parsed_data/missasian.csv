"event","""To let go isn't to forget, not to think about, or ignore. It doesn't leave feelings of anger, jealousy, or regret. Letting go isn't about winning or losing. It's not about pride and it's not about how you appear, and it's not obsessing or dwelling on the past. Letting go isn't blocking memories or thinking sad thoughts, and doesn't leave emptiness, hurt, or sadness. It's not about giving in or giving up. Letting go isn't about loss and it's not about defeat. Letting go is learning and experiencing and growing. It's about all that you have, all that you had, and all that you will have. Letting go is having the courage to accept change, and the strength to keep moving. To let go is to understand."""

"event","so i've decided i have really poor anger management skills.&nbsp; you know those moments you're so mad you just want to punch/break something, then you realize there's nothing to break without severe consequences so you attempt to release your anger in other forms? like maybe taking a long run or going out for a walk but then you realize there's nowhere to go.&nbsp; then maybe option 3 is yelling at someone who won't yell back at you. but that's often rare finding someone who would do that.&nbsp; i think that's how i handle anger. first i'd like to break something, then i'd like to do something physical, and that doesn't work i'll yell. really loud.&nbsp;

"event","i think i've turned into a complete workaholic and i dont even mind. this weekend i did so much: i finished my spanish autobiography INCLUDING pictures, and my entire english portfolio in 20 hours, plus the precalc homework for BOTH days, and an entire SAT test in 3 hours. so to me that's a lot. and i'm pretty damn proud of myself.&nbsp; i still have to scribble out that APUS paper, which i'm dreading because mine's gonna come out like shizz, which is bad because it's ONLY 70% of your 4th quarter grade.&nbsp; today i started my job @ tennis heaven &amp; swim club. it was a quiant place.&nbsp; the pool just opened so things are still running new. i learned&nbsp;a lot, like vacuuming the pool and adding a ton of chemicals in the pool.&nbsp; so it's good pretty good, kinda quiet too.&nbsp; there's only ONE lifeguard working per shift. so i had to watch the pool, do chemical stuff, and clean it all by myself. it's a lot, and there's tons of responsibilities involved for ONE lifeguard on duty.&nbsp; i'm pretty nervous because if anyone drowns, it's all my fault and i'd be sued. this summer's gonna be kinda rough, but i'll get used to it. aaaand i made $24 already! yay for 3 hours, not too shabby. i definitely need the money because i got this amazing idea date thing for rutledge and my sixth month celebration.&nbsp; technically it's tomorrow, but with everything going on, we're pushing it until later, after the SATs&nbsp;and hopefully AFTER i get my license...which i WILL on june 5th. I'M GONNA FREAKIN PASS THAT THING IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO. annd if you sabatoge my chances of success...i know where you live =P.

so cool enough- i have plans for next week already. Study for the SATs as if it's the last thing i do, finish that APush paper, and...do your work. if i stay on top of stuff, i might be able to finish this year strong. and thenn next weekend there's SATs, NO PIANO LESSON/THEORY CLASS, maybe a pool party @ sarah's, then my 2nd day of work + secretariat meeting!! yaay. sad enough i'm excited to this saturday. i just want the SATs to be done with so i can stop stressing about it, even tho i prolly need to take it again in october or something. annnd SATII scores are coming out on wednesday! i really hope i did well on those too. junior year's almost over! we're almost done with this hell-esque year, even tho it's been quite nice to me.&nbsp; i had a pretty good junior year, and i think it's because of rutledge. =) anyways i'm in a cheery mood...i may go out early tomorrow morning and take a long morning run in my new shoes my mommy bought. another pair to my collection. i really should stop buying shoes, but i have&nbsp;a craving to go to Old Navy and buy a gazillion pairs of flipflops in all the colors. they're so HOT. but then again, 24 bucks can only get you so far right? gotta save for college...and gas. =)

"event","Ask the 25 year old who tried to electrocute himself.
he lived. but both of his arms are gone. 
What about jumping? Ask John. He used to be intelligent,
with an ingaging sense of humor. That was before he leapt
from a building. Now, he`s brain-damaged, & will always
need care. He staggers & has seizures. He lives in a fog. But
worst of all, he knows he used to be normal. 

What about pills? Ask the 12 year old with extensive liver
damage from an overdose. Have you ever seen someone
die with liver damage? It's a hard way to go.. 
What about a gun? Ask the 24 year old who shot himself
in the head. Now he drags one leg, has a useless arm, and
has no vision or hearing on one side. He lived through his
""fool-proof"" suicide. You might, too. 
What about crashing a car? Ask the 16 year old who drove
his mother's car into a telephone pole, trying to kill himself &
his best friend, as part of a suicide pact. Now he sits in jail,
sentanced to 15 years, for his best friends murder.

But.. who will clean your blood off of the carpet? Or scrape
your brains off of the ceiling? Commercial cleaning companies
may refuse that job, but someone has to do it..
Who will have to cut you down from where you
hung yourself or identify your bloated body after you`ve
drowned? Your father? Your mother? Your wife?
Your son? The carefully worded loving suicide note is of
no help. Those who loved you will never completely
recover. They`ll feel regret, & an un-ending pain.
Suicide is contagious. Look around you family.
Look closely at the 4 year old playing with his cars on the
rug. Kill yourself tonight, & he may do it 10 years from now.
You do have other choices. There are people who can help
you through this crisis. Call a hotline. Call a friend. Call your
minister or priest. Call a doctor or a hospital. Call the police.
They will tell you that there's hope. Maybe you'll find it in the
mail tomorrow; or in a phone call this weekend. But what
you`re seeking could just be a minute, a month, or a day away.

REMEMBER; SUiCiDE iS A PERMANENT SOLUTiON TO
A TEMPORARY PROBLEM.

"event","woot AP chem is OVER! the multiple choice was kinda hard, but the part II was easy compared to the other year's.  i'm really glad the first question wasn't an acid/base/buffer/titration question, cuz i would have been SCREWED! Ksp i'm actually somewhat decent at, so i think i did well. plus i think i raped that descriptive chemistry section because that was definitely easy. hexane combustion? hell yeah! overall, i didn't walk out feeling like crap like i did for statistics. but i'm really glad it's over.

afterwards, i went to vhots with phizicky and i got my very first garbage plate! it was so artery clogging yummy-filled with goodness.  a definite treat after all the APs i took. yay for that. then i had driver's ed, so that was fun. i had a good time driving today for some reason. we hit the thruways and i was zooming at 75 mphs. it was a thrill ride. and i love how danny totally freaked out when kelly hit the thruways. there were those silly moments...you know.

i'm so glad these APs are over, now i have 4th 5th 6th (opposite gym) 7th AND 8th (until june 5th) freee!! yaay for doing nothing and wasting time! even tho i got SATs coming up real fast

PROM IS FREAKIN NEXT WEEKEND! I'M SO EXCITED (well partially at the moment) WE GET TO DOLL UP AND LOOK EXTRA PRETTY!! WOOT FOR SPARKLES! and we're one step closer to senior year!!

love you all<3"

"event","my last ap exam is tomorrow! thank god. this AP week actually flew by quicker than i thought. with all these extra free periods, i'm bored as hell, even tho i have TONS OF STUFF TO DO! including my driver's ed project which i haven't even CONSIDERED yet.

chemistry is tomorrow. i think i'm more prepared than i thought. i don't need to get 100 on all the questions. i just need to know how to guess in my favor and get as many points as i can from part II.  i think i'll do really well on descriptive chem, because i've practiced those inside outs. if question 1 is a titration/acid/base question then i'm in trouble, but if the rest includes kinetics, rates, and solubility, i'll be a-ok. =)

driver's ed tonight. 4th to last class i think. it's almost done, thank god. i scheduled my road test for june 5, the day i turn sixteen years and 11 months old. i better pass this time because a: it'll be embarrassing to fail AGAIN and b: i'll have to start paying if i fail the 2nd time. i really wanna hit the roads solo and enjoy the life of a licensed teenager. 

prom is coming up in 11 DAYS!! i just talked to alex dk, emily's date, and psyched him up for next weekend. i'm looking foward in seeing rutledge in his tux, because he will be hotter than hell. he is already adorable, but formal wear adds a little extra. if you know what i mean. 

so life's been pretty nice to me. i've gotten my energy back. time to hit the books real fast before theory tonight with the hick-meister, aka bennet. =)

Put down the magazine and get off the phone
Cuz theres a place I wanna show u and it wont take long
Take a ride

Its lookin like we're getting there
Over here, comin clear
Place that has no rhymes, or times, or crimes
Just good times

Take me away
To a place where the good times good times roll
Don't let me stay
In a place where this hate can steal my soul

Got myself worked up over nothing today
All this trash in my head I gotta throw it away
Its alright

Its lookin like we're getting there
Over here, comin clear
Place that has no rhymes, or times, or crimes
Just good times

This is it, I'm finally here
And all the blurry lines are clear
And everything that I cant see
Seems to make more sense to me
Why the hell cant I just let it go, let it go, yeah

Take me away
where the good times good times roll
Don't let me stay
where this hate can steal my soul
Let the good times roll"

GOSH!"" haha now when i look back on it, i look/sound pretty stupid. anyways. tomorrow/and the rest of the week will be absoutely amazing and gorgeous. i don't give a damn what you think. =P

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you I get so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight.
I'm out with you, you got me head over heels
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel

S.O.S. please someone help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making (Y.O.U.) this hard,
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night

Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And boy, your loves enough with words unspoken
I said boy I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do it's true
I'm going crazy over you,
I'm begging"

"event","wooooot stat is OVERRR forever!! well until i take it again in college but psh we won't worry about that now. i gotta admit that test was HARD. i definitely didn't think it was easy breezy as i imagined. the multiple choice wasn't tooo bad but i know i got the last wrong which sucked because i finally figured out how to do it after strazz called time. dammit. but part II was a BEAST! well, parts of it at least. i got the first few questions, but the last ""investigative one"" which is worth 12.5 percent of the entire test was IMPOSSIBLE!! when did chi-square have anything to do with the measurements of a therometer?? i figured chi-square had to deal with categorical data, definitely NOT numbers. i HATED that question. it screwed up my brain. so i walked out of that room feeling like shit. it definitely wasn't as great as i thought it would be. stat is suppose to be easy, but i don't think i did too well on that test. i'm kinda mad at myself, but any further studying wouldn't have done me any good. that was just stuff i didn't know. man i'm bummed. but i can't just chill now. i gotta start cramming for US...then chemistry...ahhh it'll be over in 8 days!

We walk in your footsteps 
Though I've had my ups and downs 
And I'll stand in the silence 
Until I figure it out 

One might fall and the other will stand 
And one might give where the other won't bend 
The night is bright as the sun 

I'm never gonna know 
Never gonna look back 
Never gonna know where we would have ended up at 
The end has only begun 

So stop counting the hours 
Live out in the world 
Cause I've been chasing the answers 
And they don't want to be found 

One might fall and the other will stand 
And one might give where the other won't bend 
The night is as bright as the sun 

I'm never gonna know 
Never gonna look back 
Never gonna know where we would have ended up at 
The end has only begun 

Well the day 
Tonight feels like a million miles away 
And these times just won't change 
Life just stays the same 
I'd give anything to see the light of day 

Cause I've been too far away 
To hear you whispering 

They say one might fall and the other will stand 
And one might give where the other won't bend 
The night is as bright as the sun 

I'm never gonna know 
Never gonna look back 
Never gonna know where we would have ended up at 
The end has only begun 

Well the day 
Tonight feels like a million miles away 
And these times just won't change 
Life just stays the same 
I'd give anything to see the light of day 

What you do 
No one can decide it's up to you 
And who you are is what you choose 
These times when the world falls apart 
Make us who we are"

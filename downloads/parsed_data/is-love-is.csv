"event","Today in tennis we played the meanest girls I've ever met in my life.  They were super pretty and moderately talented but I couldn't help but be moved to shock by their atrocious attitudes. Seriously, it was unreal.  The worst thing was I could totally see myself two years ago going ""Can you make your calls a little louder we're kinda far away"" with more bitchiness in every syllable than I thought was possible.  It's tennis.  There's no reason to make a friendly polite game into bitchfest '08.  Females have been such a disappointment to me lately.  I suppose it's really people in general, I just take more notice and offense when women live up to their stereotypical catty personalities.  If you want to be in your own group in dance class, it's ok.  If you said some mean things about my friend because you don't know her that well, an apology will suffice and it's ok.  If you're on a high school sports team, the opponent doesn't have to be the enemy. They're just people.  They might even be really cool people.  I wish everyone could take a step back and realize how incredible it is to exist.  I never want to feel the twinge of jealousy or resentment when i see someone.  It's so ridiculous.  I want to like everyone, and i want to hear other people's stories, and their opinions.  And I want to have real conversations about everything.  

and furthermore, I want to know if I should go to Maryland or St. Mary's next year"

"event","I met frank warren yesterday.  Then arrived at the homecoming game in time to get in free, see a bunch of graduates, and witness a humiliating defeat.  Sometimes life's all right.  Except realizing its not 8th grade anymore and our football team sucks.

Today i'm going to Towson instead of homecoming.  I'm a little bummed because i'm all about dressing up and dancing around all night, but I'm excited too, senior year just keeps reinforcing how much i want to leave.

And I'm working on a project where I'm compiling a bunch of cover songs on cds and then making the counterparts with the originals..and organizing them and stuff...
so if you know of any really good covers or your favorites or whatever let me know"

"event","so, i broke my neck.

technically i fractured the 7th cervical vertebra...cervical doesnt seem like the right word though because it's at the top of my back but whatever.  The bone is completely separated and is just chillen out in my back, hopefully it'll fuse itself back together

until then i get some codeine and a neck brace, but i dont have to wear it all the time

oh yeah, how i did this, i was in dance class trying to do a forward roll out of standing on one leg..it obviously didn't turn out too well and i hit the floor and snapped this bone in the process, i was in pain for 5 days and then we went to urgent care today and got x-rays and found out why.

..and no one believed me when i kept saying i hurt my back"

"event","I hate school so much, there should be more hours in the day, and less of them devoted to school.

At 3:00 this morning i woke up to a horrible pain in my ear, not the kind from my actual ear, but from the earings and all the way down the egde.  It was soooo painful and i just kept thinking what could possibly be wrong with my earrings to make them hurt this badly, so i took them out and put ear stuff on them but the pain was enough to keep me up for another hour, it sucked.

I haven't put very much effort into getting dressed/showering/putting on makeup in a whiiiile, maybe thats part of why i've been hating school so much, the one fun thing about it is nonevident right now, it doesn't help that none of my clothes fit.

I'm going to try harder this term to get better grades, in the meantime matt and jill got me final fantasy XII for my birthday and it's sweeeeeeeeet"

"event","I've been meaning to write a real entry about everything...that was about what i felt instead of just what was going on, but it's been really hard.  I can't believe i've gotten so good at holding back tears, but in situations like this someone has to be the strong one that the other can depend on... and I never thought I'd be able to before, but now I know that I can.  Everyday I think things should be getting better but it seems like it's just getting worse, emotionally and/or physically and when it looks like it's at the worst point for the day somehow it gets better and there's a new hope that tommorrow things will be better. 

I realized that the thing that hurts me most is not seeing them laugh, the one thing I would like to see more than anything is for them to be genuinely happy about something and laugh.  They're both such happy positive people, I miss that so much right now.

so the second doctor came today after what, 6 days, oh well at least he came today, dan's definitely not getting surgery but he'll still be there for a while longer.  the beginning of next week is celebration central 3month-birthday-halloween sunday monday and tuesday...i hope i can spend them all at the hospital...and yes i will be going in costume on halloween"

"event","so, for anyone who cares or doesn't already know everything that went down last night this is my recap as i experienced everything

i hung out with dan after school and i had to work at 4 so he dropped me off at my house and i went to work.&nbsp; At around 6 i went on break and got out my phone where I had a text from marykate...""dan was in a car accident with corey and brian of are in the ER""&nbsp; it didn't make perfect sense but i got the jist of it and promptly started freaking out

i tried to call mk a couple times with no answer then dan then mk again until she answered, they weren't at the hospitol yet so she told me all she knew, that brian was driving and was at FMH and that corey and dan were worse and were at a hospitol in bethesda.&nbsp; Then i called my mom, by this point i'm in tears, and i told her everything I knew and she said she was coming to get me from work.&nbsp; Then blair walked around the corner and i told her what happened, they tried to call the hospitol but we didn't get any information.&nbsp; Then i got a call from danielle saying she and katrina were going to the hospitol and I was going with them I told them i'd be home in 10 minutes and as soon as my mom got there i left.

Katrina and danielle picked me up and we drove to the hospitol all really worried and in or on teh verge of tears, close to the hospitol we got a call from mk saying that corey dislocated his hip and hit his head on something and got some kind of concusion they were currently giving him a catskan, and dan fractured his wrist and did something to his back

we got to the hospitol and i went straight back to where dan was, he couldn't walk or even stand he rolled out of the car but he was talking and stuff but was in a lot of pain so I asked him to tell me what happened the story is as follows: brian was driving his mom's car corey was in the front seat and dan was behind him, brian was driving way too fast going 70 down&nbsp;mussetter and trying to pass someone near the railroad tracks? they lost control and ran head on into a tree, brian was ok, dan and corey somehow got themselves out of the car.&nbsp; they tried to bring in a helicopter but it couldn't land so they took them in ambulances


the doctors came in and wrapped up dan's wrist, told him he had to stay flat, and gave him more drugs, he has an MRI this morning to find out if he'll need surgery on his back or a brace of some kind...he fractured the lower L1...whatever that means and we'll find out more today

i only saw corey briefly at the end he has a bad hit on his head which causes him to forget everything about every 30 seconds, he recognized everyone but didn't really know what happened he kept asking ""who's car?"" and trying to figure out what happened, the doctor's said he was in shock and should remember things in about 12 hours, they were able to pop his hip back into place

rachael and I&nbsp;went home at about 10 and stopped at sean and brians to talk to sean heather and tom and see what they knew, we talked with them for awhile and then went back to my house

I could barely sleep last night and kept having dreams about everything i really want to get back up to the hospitol this morning...school is not happening, sean heather and tom said that they were going with bryce this morning but i haven't heard from them yet hopefully they'll call soon and i can get a ride and find out more....i'm really bad at shortening stories but this has no exaggerations....

i'm still scared but compared to all the things running through my head last night i'm so glad that they're as ok as they are...it could've been soooo much worse..hopefully i'll find out more today"

I'm not used to being in this situation, especially with you,&nbsp;I never thought i'd care so much what you thought<br />6. people always say we would make a good couple, WEIRD, but there have been times when i've agreed<br />7. you think you're so much better than everyone else and you make me seem like a worthless person, its hard to argue with you, you make me so angry, but i still love you<br />8. what can i say without this being obvious, i miss us, i think we died...and that would kill me<br />9. all we do is bash ourselves and others we need something to talk about<br />10. It was weird what happened, i always like to think you're talking about me and that I'm not just like all the others, I really enjoyed our friendship<br />"

"event","i guess this would be a good place to talk about my new schedule so i will!

1st-Dance1...this class is amazing i have it with becca and danielle! hah and johnny its so sweet. i cant really dance but whatever......and i really dont care about all the other little bitchy freshmen because they can suck it

2nd-show choir...wow. does anything more really need to be said? i think if you're friends with me you already know how much this class affects my life and makes me really happy haha. im the biggest dork i know. but whatever its amazing...i want to be a section leader this year but we did vocal ranges today and i went up a whooole lot from last year...i think im a soprano now :0 i erased a few notes on the top though because i love harmonies too much to leave the alto section

3rd-biology...this class is sweet because its got racheal sierra and dylan and me all sitting together in the back row...aka me and sierra passing notes via dylan, haha it shouldnt be too incredibly hard either

4th-spanish3...well this class has some serious issues it started out as like 70 kids in an IB room....and blahblah now theres 46 of us in kavanaughs room...its packed but i love spanish so it should be easy




Matthew left for college today! he's all grown up :'( im gonna miss having him and jill around the house all the time...but i wont miss him acting like he owned the basement..which leads me to my next point
OC parties are back in session if anyone is still interested haha, but now its on even later so its still sketchy


finally, auditions for the musical are tomorrow and i am incredibly nervous like always.  my voice isnt up to what it normally is because ive had a cold for like 2 weeks and im living off cough drops but hopefully i can pull it off...i still dont know which piece im singing for the auditions....""I'll know"" is higher than my normal range..but who knows? maybe i can pull it off...and the other one which name escapes me at the moment requires an accent? and has thirds...so its a tough call, neither of them are too appealing.


i kindof miss my old classes
p.s. courtney im bringing you my old bag/ some ap euro stuff if you want to look through it tomorrow morning in the cafeteria or whatever"

"event","have you ever met Chet? 
Chet is my alter-ego, he's probably the biggest loser you'll ever meet, but he has no idea.

chet is old, bald, fat, lives with his mom, and never gets laid.  he spends most of his time playing video games (the really weird ones, not like gta and the like) and scamming on 14 year old girls over the internet.  chet is very secure with himself, he thinks his life is awesome, but he's the kind of guy who if you saw walking down the street (only when new star wars movies come out) you would cross the street.  he makes people uneasy, but if he's not making you uneasy your probably making fun of him.  but chet never judges or makes fun of anybody else. no one really gives chet a chance to get to know him because hes such a loser. but he is perfectly content with his life. 
chet is all sorts of things that alli is and is not
he typically doesnt refer to himself in the third person, thats a main difference.

i can only strive to be more like chet in the way i think, leaving out all the other stuff, he's actually a pretty cool guy."

then midnight was approaching so we turned on dick clark and waited for the ball, while getting ""the new year"" by death cab ready to be played..the second the ball dropped we played it and it was amazing, then we proceeded to go outside and there were water baloons involved, and some fireworks of course. then came my favorite part of the evening, we all went to the back porch and sat around the table, we shared our resolutions, sortof played BS, and mike was playing songs on his guitar, including ""wonderwall"" by oasis which we sang to...i think it was one of the greatest moments of my life all of us sitting around singing to that, i dont care if it sounds lame (my resolution in action!) we kept looking for other songs we could sing to that he could play it was so much fun.&nbsp; eventually we went back inside more guitarplaying/singing, talking, eating, mike and kenny left a little after that.&nbsp; then we watched Boondock Saints which was amazing, and then Animal House, which was hilarious...there was a lot of talking and laughing and michele and i were the first to go to sleep at around 6am.

"event","so lately all my entries have been sad and have made me cry while writing/reading them.  i cried so much last week if you collected all my tears i would probably drown in it.  but time goes on and we have to take something out of it all. i, for one, genuinly want to be a better/nicer/more accepting person. i dont want to waste my time talking about or making fun of other people when things can be so hurtful and it doesnt benefit me in the least. it would be more productive to be nice to people, if you see something you like, compliment it, you never know what can brighten someone's day,..or week, life, whatever

i still remember certain things that people i dont even know have said to me that have really affected me, and i want to feel like i can have that affect on other people...and just be known as a really good person who you would want as your friend or want to be around, thats all i want.  so cool! thanks for liking my hair, because i hate the first time you change something and everyones like...noticing and whatnot, but yeah it was cool it made me feel good.

"event","ooook here we go.  this is all you've been hearing from me lately but it's basically all that's been on my mind so i'm sorry. don't read it if you don't want to.

the service was today in the auditorium of the highschool.  i knew i would cry more but it was really a lot, my head ached so badly at the end i thought i might get sick.  there were pictures and a guest book and they did a lot of readings from the bible.  her youth minister spoke a lot, saying what an amazing person she was and how much god influenced her life.  a friend of the family sang ""my immortal"" it was really touching and i think it was appropriate.  they didnt try to cover up what happened either which i also thought was appropriate.  she killed herself and they addressed that as it was, she was so intelligent and good hearted but she had really complex thoughts and emotions, and insecurities, and a need for perfection. in the end she just wanted to be with god.  each member of the family gave a speech they were really incredible, each talking about how much love she had and memories of good times.  and then chris spoke. its making me tear up now, i cant begin to comprehend what its like to lose a twin...your other half.  i dont think anyone can imagine what louisa was thinking fully its just been so painful for so many people. they kept saying that she was forgiven in god's eyes and their own..it was really moving

the whole service was hard for me to think through because i dont have much faith of my own.  i almost want to but i dont know if i can. i really hope in my heart that louisa is at peace wherever she is, or if she is. and that the reynolds find the strength to keep going."

then jenni and i had our sushi date with randy and scott it was cool it was the first time i went to that place by the movies, it was pretty good i wasn't really in the mood to eat much
new hair!:::

its shorter than i wanted. but she said that my hair was so damaged from everything i've done to it that i needed to cut it all off, she said it will grow faster now anyway...which i still dont understand..but whatever im glad to have red again...even though it will fade reeeally fast because it was so intensly blonde before...ohhh well:::






after i got home we went to the viewing. everyone said it didnt look like her but i thought she did.  i met her parents, i dont know how they did that twice today.  they said she didnt know what she was doing to all her friends, she wasnt thinking.  i was just trying to be strong in front of them.  we didnt stay long.  service is tomorrow at the school."

"event","today was incredibly hard. i feel so selfish for being upset about my homework or anything else so meaningless....1st block went fairly normal i didnt even know something was wrong until i got to 2nd..the guidance counselors were waiting for us and mr roberts was there..the question on the board was ""how do you make it snow"" and i was laughing at the answers and we were all turning in our stupid essays.

and as i was stapleing mine mr roberts said ""there was a tragedy this morning and louisa will no longer be in our class, she took her own life"" i was frozen on the spot and immedietly started crying...our whole class was.  i seriously could barely compose myself all day i cant believe it. louisa was one of the smartest people i've ever met, she was taking 3 ap classes...i wanted to drop out of my one.  she was always laughing always making class more fun..she just seemed so happy.  

it really shows you how serious depression is and the guidance counselors kept telling us theres nothing anyone could do, and its nobody's fault...but anyone who knew this girl im sure feels differently, its so hard when you can put a face and a personality with the name...actually know the person...and see that empty desk every day.  i cant think about anything else. its times like these when you want something to believe and you want answers.

pretty much bullshit...no chance of anything happening tonight
so yeah i'm writing this essay on marxism vs. adam smith and stuff like that...stuff that no one knows/cares about, but i basically cried my eyes out because im so stressed.  i really cant handle this class/the workload/everything.  besides this paper which will take me a good few hours i have another essay due tomorrow that i also have to do tonight ...if i dont turn them in tomorrow i risk being soley responsible for having the whole class fail this test bc of the multiple choice...its complicated


among other things...salon this week (no, not the relaxing day-spa one) i have to dress up like an old dead fat guy and pretend i know something about history and being enlightened....yeahhhhhh thats gonna go well. why is everyone so smart? i hate this class and i curse all who enjoy european history, lets just dance.

pretty good weekend it was the first time ive hung out with people in a while...but it doesnt really feel like it, november went by really fast christmas christmas everywhere now.  its good. if only i can get through this week..i just have to take it one day at a time.....maybe i can convince my parents that i need another mental health break...just first block should suffice this time, many of you already know i got sick friday and we dont want that happening again do we? ...does anyone even read this through all the way to down here...usually if i see someone has a big entry i jst skim it for anything interesting. so if you actually read this all the way. let me know! because im curious.
ok, well im pretty sure i cant possibly stall anymore, if i do go to school on time tomorrow (7 1/2 hours from now) ill either be on a no sleep energy burst..or incredibly tired

whatever, time to get back to my dear friends Adam Smith and Karl Marx"

"event","so lately i've been searching for a reason to live.  im not saying in the depressing way that everything is pointless...just questioning everything..and trying to figure out what the best way to live my life would be, or how to do it.

and as i was thinking/staring/meditating, and then reading i decided that there are 2 things that are worth striving for in life 1)having as much fun and enjoyment as you possibly can 2)learning as much and taking in as much information that you can handle


yeah..learning, but if you think thats making me put school anywhere close to the top of my list of important things you are dead wrong..i mean <i>real learning</i> studying everything around you, figuring out about people and interactions, reading until your eyes fall out, just really discovering whats around

i think if i can just do those 2 things...i can get through life and feel accomplished and then who cares what happens next?  this is me finding a substitute for the one thing missing in my life that needs to be filled"

"event","ok, so that last entry was rachel getting a taste of livejournal so you can read it or not or whatever...anyway

today i am taking a much needed mental health day and such and staying home from school.  its probably stupid because i had a math quiz and missing ap euro is never good...but i could walk at anytime if i feel like it, or i might get my mom to take me at noon when she comes home.  

so basically im cleaning, doing laundry, listening to imogen heap, burning insence and just relaxing.  ill probably take my dogs on a walk in a bit and get some fresh air.  the neighborhood gets so quiet during the day its almost eerie, but really nice too.  it feels like time stops or something and theres just wind blowing..then of course i turn the corner and see construction workers eating sandwiches..whatever.

i dont really dislike highschool im just not really fond of the whole school thing, but im getting by like 39 school days left in the term...im counting down.

and christmas and everything is coming up too..which makes me really happy except that we arent going to dundee for thanksgiving or christmas this year because of dad working/laurens friend coming up...its depressing we've gone there for christmas for like the last 5 years..or at least sometime around it...dundee is my christmas i dont want to not be there, it wont be the same...

well this is just me going on and on when i should be doing other things so thats pretty much all i have to say time is going pretty fast which im glad about...
and my mom said i can get my nose peirced as a christmas present? so thats fun!..anything else? no i dont think so..

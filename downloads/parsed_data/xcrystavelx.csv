"event","i just woke up from a 
dream
which threw me back into a state of mind 
of me at 
seventeen.
and i can't shake it.
its like when you hear a cd you 
listened to at one 
certain point
in your life.
and you get that strange feeling 
of the era when you had listened to it before
and the emotions and sensibilities 
that align themselves
with that time period.
i feel like ive just woken up after 
falling asleep at seventeen
and just knowing everything thats 
happened in between
but not really being the person 
who now owns this body.

it is very strange
and it's putting much of my current situation 
into 
perspective."

im not sure why i am so upset, but i am.  i guess ive never had to deal with death that was at all close to me, and then in the past six months ive had so many people in my life die.  im really not taking kellys death well.  she was so amazing.  maybe its just that i got my wisdom teeth pulled and im all fucked up on vicodin, but i just cant deal with this.  and like all of the deaths ive been surrounded with lately, it looks like i wont be able to make the funeral. which i think, more and more, really is a key element in in grief."

"event","The world is full of women
who'd tell me I should be ashamed of myself
if they had the chance. Quit dancing.
Get some self-respect
and a day job.
Right. And minimum wage,
and varicose veins, just standing
in one place for eight hours
behind a glass counter
bundled up to the neck, instead of 
naked as a meat sandwich.
Selling gloves, or something.
Instead of what I do sell.
You have to have talent 
to peddle a thing so nebulous
and without material form.
Exploited, they'd say. Yes, any way
you cut it, but I've a choice
of how, and I'll take the money.

I do give value.
Like preachers, I sell vision,
like perfume ads, desire
or its facsimile. Like jokes
or war, it's all in the timing.
I sell men back their worse suspicions:
that everything's for sale,
and piecemeal. They gaze at me and see
a chain-saw murder just before it happens,
when thigh, ass, inkblot, crevice, tit, and nipple
are still connected.
Such hatred leaps in them,
my beery worshippers! That, or a bleary
hopeless love. Seeing the rows of heads 
and upturned eyes, imploring
but ready to snap at my ankles,
I understand floods and earthquakes, and the urge 
to step on ants. I keep the beat,
and dance for them because
they can't. The music smells like foxes,
crisp as heated metal
searing the nostrils
or humid as August, hazy and languorous
as a looted city the day after,
when all the rape's been done
already, and the killing,
and the survivors wander around
looking for garbage
to eat, and there's only a bleak exhaustion.
Speaking of which, it's the smiling
tires me out the most. 
This, and the pretence
that I can't hear them.
And I can't, because I'm after all
a foreigner to them.
The speech here is all warty gutturals,
obvious as a slab of ham,
but I come from the province of the gods
where meanings are lilting and oblique.
I don't let on to everyone,
but lean close, and I'll whisper:
My mother was raped by a holy swan.
You believe that? You can take me out to dinner. 
That's what we tell all the husbands.
There sure are a lot of dangerous birds around.

Not that anyone here
but you would understand.
The rest of them would like to watch me
and feel nothing. Reduce me to components
as in a clock factory or abattoir.
Crush out the mystery.
Wall me up alive
in my own body. 
They'd like to see through me, 
but nothing is more opaque
than absolute transparency.
Look--my feet don't hit the marble!
Like breath or a balloon, I'm rising,
I hover six inches in the air
in my blazing swan-egg of light.
You think I'm not a goddess?
Try me.
This is a torch song.
Touch me and you'll burn.

anyway, i lit a candle for him at a vigil tonight.  and now im watching it burn out.

"event","Article XVII of the Constitution of this state would be amended by adding:
A marriage between one man and one woman is the only lawful domestic union that shall be valid or recognized in this State. This State and its political subdivisions shall not create a legal status, right or claim respecting any other domestic union, however denominated. This State and its political subdivisions shall not recognize or give effect to a legal status, right or claim created by another jurisdiction respecting any other domestic union, however denominated. Nothing in this section shall impair any right or benefit extended by the State or its political subdivisions other than a right or benefit arising from a domestic union that is not valid or recognized in this State. This section shall not prohibit or limit parties, other than the State or its political subdivisions, from entering into contracts or other legal instruments. 

What It Means

South Carolina will directly violate one of the bedrocks of our Constitution and country, ""equal protection under the law.""
South Carolina same-sex couples and their children will be relegated to second class citizens and denied rights accorded to every other South Carolinian.
Government will tell state institutions and private corporations that they may not offer benefits to same-sex couples and their families.
South Carolina will directly violate ""the full faith and credit"" clause of the Constitution. Same-sex couples who have been married in Massachusetts or another country will find their legally recognized marriages nullified in our state.
Common law marriage will be eliminated.
Domestic violence laws, protections and support systems will fail to include same-sex couples.

The bottom line? Constitutionally sanctioned discrimination and inequality. 

in the end it was 819530 in favor of the amendment, and 232044 opposed.

my so called life on youtube.
ive been sick for a month now. 
not monsterously sick.

i also gave myself a black eye.
dont even ask.
its only on the top of my eyelid, 
so it kind of looks 
like purple eyeshadow.
maybe people think its a look.
ive been wearing glasses during class. 
i think people think i have an 
abusive boyfriend.

"event","back in charleston.
it was a weird time to be back in new york.
my house is gone. 
i will never go back there again. ever.
i got choked up not walking for the last time out of the house, 
but driving down the street and looking out at that spot where you can see the hudson. i cried. 
and death. how hard it is to write that word and be serious.
it was good to see everyone, although under stressed conditions.
the beach was good. 
found out that everyone in my family knows i date girls
and it's a topic of conversation when im not around.
i have a sex bruise on my hip from a pretty girl on the beach under the stars. 
it was pretty. pretty sex.
i need more of that. 
but now charleston.
i dont think this year will much resemble last year. 
i dont think i want it too.
i feel really betrayed by most people here.
but this summer was good for me. 
'everything but hear a voice that says we're basically alone'
i think my mentality is different than most people here.
i think i take things more seriously. 
i want someone to call babe.
i want new york to come to charleston.




...imagine if the world could get behind it."

no, really.
dana got into a car accident.
slammed right into the stopped car in front of her. 
and i didnt have my seat belt on 
because alot of people dont wear theirs in charleston 
so i got out of the habbit
and i slammed my head and shattered the window
and my neck hurts
and my arm hurts
and im so thankful i didnt go straight through the window
bad. very bad.
i really almost died. 
and i think i should go to the hospital 
on acount of my neck
but my mom was yelling at me and convinced me not to go 
but it think i should. it hurts.
fuck.

fuckfuckfuck.


funny:  my mother blamed it on me. what the fuck??  she hates me."

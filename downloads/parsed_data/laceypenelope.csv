Where have all the people gone?

I think about them a lot and I wonder if they think about me.

They know who they are.

They must know I think about them.

Or do they wonder the same as me?

I sent them my telepathic messege of love.

Didn't they get it?"

"event","What I've been waiting for where I work has finally come to pass.  I've been fighting the intense desire to walk out never to return leaving behind only a legacy and a 'fuck you'.  I will admit that the main reason I haven't quit is pure laziness.  I didn't want to have to look for a new job, much less learn a new job, meet new people, etc. etc.  This is the top reason on a long list that I'm still stuck somewhere that makes me miserable.  Another huge reason is that I've been waiting for a miracle to occur that includes a new title and a new rate of pay.

And suddenly, when I least expected it...TADA!  ""Lacey, I need an Administrative Assistant, so we need to talk about your schedule and your pay"" says my boss.  So now I'll be making a closer to livable paycheck w/ a much snazzier position.  While this all sounds well and good, others I'm surrounded by are not so excited about my good fortune.  Before I even told anyone I work with two of my fellow clerks were already angry about it.  One of these clerks does about as much work as my cat and the other has worked for the hospital for about two months.  So I'm sure you can imagine how torn up I am about their being upset.  Although, it does make it difficult for me to enjoy my good news when the people I work with are not happy for me.  No one has congratulated me and this makes me angry.  Hey, man, its not my fault that my boss offered me the job they all wanted.  Well, unless working hard and being good at my job is a fault.

In other news, not so grand, my mother is in the hospital and it doesn't look like the most promising hospital stay ever.  She's the sickest I have ever seen her and I'm the first to admit (to anyone but her) that I'm scared this time.  Several of my friends have lost parents and I've tried to be there for them and I've believed that I understood as much as someone outside that situation could.  The thought of actually being in that situation has made me realize that you can't understand something like that.  There is nothing that will ever make me understand why I will one day have to live without my mother or father.  The other day I was going to eat something, but wasn't sure if it was still good.  My instant reaction was to call mom (because somewhere along the way my mother became the unquestionable authority on the life span of leftovers despite no formal training or any credentials other than several years of life).  Then I remembered that she was in the hospital and too sick to even talk to me.  Then horrible, sick dread filled me as I realized that one day there will be a much more permanent reason that I can't call my mother when I need her.  And that thought makes me feel so, terribly, alone."

"event","Notice that my subject was only one word.  That's because you only need one word when speaking on this subject because the word speaks for itself.  

First of all, know that just because you're reading this, it doesn't mean its directed at you so fuck off and just hear my rant without taking anything personal.  What's with the music overload?  Trust me when I say that I love music.  I think that music is the universal language.  Cliche I know...but that phrase is cliche for a reason - because it's bloody true.  I truly believe that music can break communication barriers faster and more thoroughly than anything else.  Some people are like, ""write it in a letter"" well I say, ""make a mixed CD"".  This is the best way say what you need to say when you can't find the words.  The music is there for a reason - to say what you can't say, what you can say, what you would never say, what can't be said enough.  No other form of entertainment can change a person's life the way music can.  Sometimes I hear a song that touches me so much that I feel like my heart can't take it.  Its possibly the most important form of artistic expression that exists today and I love it.

All that having been said - I now post these questions before my audience of few:

If you're constantly obsessed with music that pours from every corner of the world - if your focus is centered on memorizing the vast world of local music, popular music, mainstream music, indie music, underground music, etc...if you try to know every single song from every single artist that so much as strikes a chord or two--how, HOW I ASK, can music change your life?

How are you going to become so familiar with a piece of music that when you listen to it, memories from years ago are rushed back to your heart and you actually TRAVEL BACK IN TIME to a place where you were a different person?  If you're so hip and down with every nobody and every could-be-somebody aren't you letting something pass you by?  

Being in love with the IDEA of music is not loving music.  Going to a show every fucking time there's a band playing who MAY actually have some talent does not mean shit.  It doesn't mean that music is your cornerstone.  It means that you're supportive of local music.  Which is great, don't get me wrong.  That's where it all begins.  But every band is not going to make it big.  Every band doesn't DESERVE to make it big.

And aren't we missing out on something great when the only thing we listen to is new music?  Up and coming bands?  There was music before this upchuck of new bands.  There's a whole world of music already made sitting there wishing someone would take a step back and appreciate what music ALREADY IS instead of concentrating so much on what music is trying to be.

Also, don't fucking talk about how much you love music if your only reason is that it SOUNDS good.  Every person has that section of their musical knowledge or music collection that they love because the beat sounds good or its fun to dance to...that's normal and its part of music.  But NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING pisses me off more when it comes to music than when I'm sitting with a person who I KNOW isn't listening to the words - someone who I know has NEVER fucking LISTENED to the words of any song...and they're sitting there telling me how much they love the song.  FUCK YOU.  You love loving the song and you should be fucking slapped for being so disrespectful.

Stop and smell the roses is another cliche phrase I love and here's my twist on it:

STOP AND LISTEN TO THE FUCKING MUSIC.  Stop and listen to the music that actually makes a fucking difference in your life.  Slow the fuck down and actually listen to it for fucking ONCE in your goddamn life and quit pissing me the fuck off."

I feel older, I feel like no one will ever make me feel like a youngin' again.  Meaning that I've reached my final landmark.  There's no going back now.  I'm kind of sad.  Its all downhill from here.  Well, I guess its uphill for another 29 years THEN downhill.  Stereotypically speaking.  But I feel good.  I feel like it doesn't matter which direction I'm heading on the hill.  Because it, in fact, is not a hill at all.  Rather, it is an open field...with flowers, blowing in the breeze which moves softly over my skin.  Wait...no...its not a field at all.  Rather it is a peninsula...with lots of tourists, blowing in the gushes of wind that Hurricane Dennis is providing on my 21st birthday.  Asshole.  No, no negativity here.  I am all positive.

There's little in this world that pleases me the way Tom Cruise fighting for his life does.  Not for the reasons that statement implies.  Tom Cruise is a beautiful man.  Watching him do anything is a treat.  Now I'm way off topic, let's regroup.

Just once.  JUST ONCE!  I would like to see the world destroyed.  Obviously I'm referring to the movie version of ""the world"" seeing as how once is all I'd get in the real world.  I don't mean sort of destroyed, half destroyed, merely devastated.  I'm talking -- GONE.  Every man, woman and child eviscerated.  None of this ""American military saves the day"" or ""earth-air kills invaders"".  No.  Can one alien nation or fucking meteor or ice age or whatever actually SUCCEED in the destruction of mankind?  I mean, just to switch it up?  Maybe actually give earthlings a little perspective?  Something like ""hey you ungrateful little shits...one day you may be destroyed by an outside force that doesn't respond to money or political power so shut the hell up and appreciate you time!""

I thought that War of the Worlds was going to give that to me.  But it didn't.  I will say it came close.  Personally, I think its the worst thing to ever happen to this planet.  We ALMOST met our end.  But alas, mankind prevailed.  Somehow.

Cocky shithead human movie makers.

Other than mankind surviving an obviously unsurvivable situation, I would say it made for great entertainment.  I was grateful when the movie was over but only because I was so tense throughout the whole thing that I was beginning to get sore."

You know how you forget something like the name of a song or an actor in a movie....or you're in the middle of telling someone something and lose your train of thought... and its RIGHT there.  on the tip of your tongue, the edge of your brain, but you just can't get it.  That's how I feel all the time.  Like I've lost my train of thought for almost 21 years and now the government has called an order to destroy all trains and anything that goes with them.  Making it hopeless for me to ever find my missing train again.  

FIRST STEP TO WRITING CAREER:  STOP WRITING ABOUT NOT KNOWING HOW TO WRITE.

I have this theory.  We'll call it: the so far unnamed theory about ghetto people and rednecks.

& this is what it says:

People from the hood and people from the country are more alike than people may have originally believed.  They're like distant cousins who hate each other and refuse to claim they're of the same family.  On the surface they appear different.  One is generally darker skinned while the other is generally of light skin.  Once you get past that (and let's face it, that's usually the challenge for most people - the two groups included), the differences are not abundant.  Let's compare.

Preferred Methods of Defense:

Ghetto - guns, sometimes a knife; Country - guns, sometimes a machete

Drink of Choice:

Ghetto - 40oz of beer or Wild Turkey; Country - longneck beer or Jack Daniels

Vehicle of Choice:

Ghetto - tricked out car to pickup girls in; Country - tricked out pickup to go muddin' in

Pet of Choice:

Ghetto - pitt bull; Country - blood hound  
(they're both dogs and that similarity can't be overlooked)

Drug of Choice:

Ghetto - marijuana; Country - dip and marijuana
(isn't everyone's drug of choice marijuana?)

Most Common Musical Subjects:

Ghetto - drugs, sex and cars; Country - drinking, cheating and trucks

There may or may not be a second study on language and dialect depending on my amount of free time over the next few days.  It would seem that Nelly knew more than he let on when recording ""Country Grammar""...

DISCLAIMER:  THIS THEORY IS BASED ON ONE GIRL'S PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS WHILE LIVING 20 YEARS IN THE COUNTRY AND 1 YEAR IN THE GHETTO."

Monday and Tuesday were boring.  WEDNESDAY however, was full of smashing good fun.  I woke up actually feeling as though I were on that so called ""cloud 9"" everyone's always talking about.  I kissed my honey before he left for work.  

Logan:  I love you.  Have a good day.
Lacey:  I love YOU.  YOU have a good day. <pause>  Honey, we'll BOTH have a good day today.

(yes I actually said that)

He left and I finished getting ready, my hair doing almost exactly what I want it to and I practically hum my way to my car.  I'm cruisin along pull out onto sw13thSt...move over to the left hand lane...

oh, there's a big turtle in the road..BETTER SLOW DOWN.  poor turtle wouldn't want to hit it...uh oh...he's moving faster than i thought...straddling it may not be an option....better hit the brakes....<checks rear view mirror...>  ""Shit.""  

Arms go flyin' up - car flies forward. big redneck truck getting real friendly with delilah's rear end.  

So after this fun experience I then proceeded to stand on the hot asphalt of chop stix parking lot SWEATING literally so much sweat that had it been grass i was standing on instead of the asphalt, no seed of anything would ever sprout again because honey, I SALTED THE EARTH.

la la la.  lovely morning, didn't go to work.  my PRIMARY care physician would not see me because their ""policy"" states that they will not see accident victims even if they are a regular patient.  worthless sons of bitches.  what are they good for? achoo achoo/here's a cold pill?  fuck that.  

Thursday i go see my newly appointed primary care physician who tells me to wear a neck brace.  yes that's right, i've become the rear-ended cliche.  but i tell you.  my neck fucking hurts.  the rest of my thursday consisted of sitting on my ass wondering why my insurance company hasn't called me back about a rental car.

Thursday night i get a phone call and my sister in law is giving birth.  so i missed the birth of what is ultimately my last niece.  which wouldn't be so bad - i can deal w/ missing the birth.  not that fun to watch anyway...
but then Friday gets here.

I have been up since 7am because i can't sleep for more than two hours because of ""THE PAIN IN MY NECK"" (haha i get to use the phrase literally...) and stranded.  i can't drive anywhere.  even if i had a car, my neck hurts too bad to risk the drive.  i can't go see my new niece or my family bc i have no way to get there.

and did i mention i'm on the rag too?  well i'm mentioning it now.  oh timing, how impeccable you are.  
mmmmmwhhaawww.  kisses from the cripple stranded hungry girl."

Her name is Brandy.  she's my age.  we seemed to have hit it off.  but i think maybe she hits it off with anyone she meets.  ok, so i know i just had this conversation with one of my dearest friends where i was comforting her...but why is it so fucking difficult to make friends?  all i could think about walking to my car tonight after spending the whole day at work w/ her was about all the fights we may have in the future, how many times i'll probably be uncomfortable around her.  i wondered how often i will be in a situation with her where i stupidly think i have to impress her followed by the horrible feeling where i realize that i don't know how to impress people anymore.  BECAUSE I'VE NEVER NEEDED TO BEFORE.  this is not who i am - i don't worry about who i am and whether it will be good enough or not.  i never used to do this.  of course i had normal teenage insecurities - i never thought i put enough effort into being pretty or interesting - but i had friends. god i had so many wonderful, fun and interesting friends who LOVED me.  where did they go?  they seem so far away.  i feel like a childish fool for thinking that i would always have that comfort ""my fucking comfort zone"" my comfort my blanket.  my long drive home listening to music my near death experiences with people i wouldn't mind dying beside.  wasted braincells on hours of movies and lack of sleep.  oooohhhh lack of sleep.  what i wouldn't give to just have lack of sleep again!! to be able to stay up all night because you were too happy to go to sleep - too busy talking and laughing and staying up all night and then going to the beach the next morning and napping for two hours and driving home.  longing for something already gone something that will never be i will never be.  such a blessing having ties being retied such a sadness for ties that will always be too untied - two short strings that cant reach each other - fifty short strings - a million strings that i'll never tie.  so much missing so many things that i don't have despite how happy i am with someone who treats me like a queen.  better than a queen - a favorite pet - a lover a best friend - i need a best friend of everything missing a girl A GIRL i'm so sick of men. i get along better with men.  BULLSHIT.  women are difficult but i love them and no man will ever sit with me and understand the beautiful and sad double edged sword of a chocolate glazed krispy creme donut.  how delicious and wonderful it seems the comfort it brings and the inevitable change it makes inside you when you finish eating it and then you realize that the comfort was short lived and that all you have left to show for this sweet delicate thing is a feeling of sad and full and so so so empty.  a woman who will understand that sometimes i just fuckingCRY.  it doesn't always mean that my world is falling apart! nothings wrong i just have to cry i have to release this chaos - a demon that feels like if it doesn't liquify and salinify and empty and make my shoulders shake that it will die leaving behind an unfullfilled life - sometimes i just need to cry.  sometimes i just need to rant.  sometimes i just need to have a drink and sit at my computer listening to music that makes me feel so much."

But I think that by society's standards I'm 2 or 3 years past my due date.  But I say if society thinks 20 years old is generally too young to choose a spouse and too young to have children...too young to rent a fucking car and too young to get your tubes tied...then I AM NOT CHOOSING A CAREER.  I got my acceptance letter to the College of Journalism at the University of Florida and it made me feel a million different things at once (also known as ""confused"").  Isn't this what I've always wanted?  To be a writer -- to write.  But at the University of Florida?  Maybe not so much.

What do I want to do for the rest of my life?  I want to spend every day with Logan.  I want to watch Buffy and Angel so much that when I die I go to Buffy and Angel heaven (where else would God send me?...maybe I should rethink that question...).  I want to cook lots of food for lots of friends.  I want to play board games and cards and make cookies.  I want to talk to my mom about everything and smoke pot on occasion.  For the rest of my life I want to get good and drunk at least twice a year and do shrooms every summer.  I want to read every comic book I own and then some...and listen to way too much music.  Is there a career that offers those things?  NO.  There fucking isn't.  So, its not really about what I WANT to do for the rest of my life, is it?  Its a little more like, ""Lacey, what are you willing to get paid to do for the rest of your life?"".  Don't get me wrong, I've long ago accepted that work has to be a part of our lives in order to survive.  I just wish I hadn't been so manipulated by the sales pitch.

My dream job -- I wish I even knew what that meant anymore.  Right now the only thing I can think about is how since before I can remember I've been going to school.  And now I'm supposed to go to more?  I got my AA what more do I really have to do?  When's the madness going to end?  Three years at a two year college and I can honestly say that I learned diddly shit.  Ok, so I learned something -- shit I learned in high school.  The only classes where I learned more than that were career specific.  So why the hell are students required to take these other classes?  Review?  Reviewing what we learned during the first 13 years of our education?  Why, I ask, WHY?!?!  If I could have spent that time and money taking a variety of classes within specific careers then maybe I would A)not be so burnt out on school and B)have a fucking clue as to what I want to do for a living?  To hell with this system.  I'm joining a tribe."

I watched him and wondered how he felt about the encounter.  Had he been touched by her compassion for his immortal soul?  Or was he simply insulted by her assumption that his life needed to change?  Thinking about it afterward I was insulted for him.  Do Christians honestly believe that the absence of religion holds that much sway on a person's happiness?  I mean, was there a study done?  Did the scientific community conclude that people who actively believe in god are less likely to be depressed?  Less likely to hate their jobs, more likely to love their spouse?

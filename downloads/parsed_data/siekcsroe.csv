If he said much more, he&#39;d give in to the intense need to start a tirade about the screwed-upness that was his life. The universe wouldn&#39;t give him a moment&#39;s peace, and also refused to give him the opportunity to just <i>talk</i> to <i>his</i> Danny though he&#39;d been wanting to since the first time he&#39;d shifted over to Alt.1 and sleep was a <i>necessity</i> not just a suggestion, you know.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3""><i>This</i> Danny, (Alt.4-Danny, Steve automatically cataloged him) sensed that he was at his breaking point.

He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, and talked himself out of going in to see what was taking so long, for the eighth time. He had the door open and one foot on the ground when Danny and Kono rounded the corner, looking a lot more relaxed than they had any right, in Steve&#39;s opinion.</font></font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">We got it,&rdquo; Kono said with a grin, hopping into the back.</font></font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">They&#39;re releasing Steve as we speak,&rdquo; Danny said, then at Steve&#39;s look, &ldquo;they Governor, uh, caught us in the act.

It wasn&#39;t just coincidence and instinct that made him run into Chin as soon as he got there, and talk to him about Five-0. All this shit had to be happening for a reason. Otherwise, it was just the universe (or multiple universes, actually) playing tug-o-war with him for the sheer hell of it and the idea that it was all coincidence was so maddening that he wouldn&#39;t even entertain the notion.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve noticed that he was drumming his fingers jerkily on the bar.

He shook his head and smothered a fond smile. He really should be used to it by now.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation?&rdquo; Danny asked, leaning back out the door.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve would have said something brilliantly witty, but he was too damn tired, so he just brushed past Danny, jumping when he smacked his ass.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">When he turned away from Danny&#39;s cheeky grin, he froze, the flush that&#39;d raced to his face moments before fading quickly as he paled. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3""><i>This is not my house</i>, said a very loud voice in his head. Though the outside was identical, there was no <i>way</i>...He looked closer, recognized a few things as his own, and a little of the tension eased. But not much. There were a lot of things he&#39;d never seen before, like a squashy armchair in the living room, and a few pictures on the wall he didn&#39;t have to do more than glance at to know they weren&#39;t supposed to be there. Along with an untidy clutter of Danny-things that had mixed with his own stuff and started to take over, like a kudzu infestation.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">This place looks like a tornado hit it,&rdquo; he said, then shook his head.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Hey, I&#39;m hurt, here.

Suddenly all of the lingering touches made sense&mdash;yeah Danny was a touchy-feely guy, but today he&#39;d been in fine form. And now Steve knew why. He wasn&#39;t <i>his</i> Danny. No more than the guy in the picture, though identical, was <i>him</i>. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve felt something clench deep in his gut, and it felt a lot like loss. He pushed past the feeling, turned in the circle of Danny--<i>Other-Danny</i>&#39;s arms, and gently pulled away.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">How long was I gone?&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;On that op?&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Danny went from goofy-grin to arms-crossed-and-angry in milliseconds flat. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve would have enjoyed listening to the rant that followed, if the life of Other-him hadn&#39;t more than likely hung in the balance. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">~~~</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve gleaned from Dan&mdash;<i>Other-Danny</i> that Other-Steve had left on some sort of secret mission to Timbuck-freaking-Tu with little more than a hi, bye, or kiss my ass. Danny&#39;s words.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">That didn&#39;t help all that much. Plan B was to snoop around on Other-Steve&#39;s computer and see if he could find anything relating to the op and possibly to Other-Steve&#39;s current location. They were damn-near identical, right? Maybe they had the same passwords. He nosed around until he found a laptop that looked like his, and repressed a triumphant <i>ha! </i>with a little difficulty.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">What are you doing?&rdquo; Of course Danny had followed him.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Just have to tie up some loose ends.&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Danny held up a hand to express <i>Are you serious? Now?</i> Then he twisted it around and raised it in defeat. &ldquo;Fine. Do what you have to do. I, for one, am taking a shower and going to bed.&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Goodnight,&rdquo; Steve said, firing up his computer. He heard an annoyed huff, and ducked his head down in the pretense of studying the keyboard, hiding a grin.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">~~~</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Are you coming to bed any time soon, or are you trying to see how long you can go without sleep again?&rdquo; Danny asked.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Gimme a minute,&rdquo; Steve said, distracted. Other-him was starting to piss him off. The first couple of passwords had been easy to guess, but Steve was getting to the juicy stuff, and they were getting cryptic. That, or his brain was slowing down, getting lazy and sluggish. He massaged his temple, then blinked until the screen came back in to sharp focus.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Danny bulldozed on when Steve didn&#39;t say anything else. &ldquo;Because, if I remember correctly (and I do) that did not end well. You are <i>not fun</i> when delirious from lack of sleep. Frankly, you&#39;re dangerous.&rdquo; </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He sighed when Steve just mumbled and dropped his head onto the desk. &ldquo;And I still get a twinge of embarrassment when I remember having to call Kono in for backup, so please&mdash;&ldquo; Danny tilted his head, &ldquo;you just passed out, didn&#39;t you?&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">***</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">(Home)</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve&#39;s neck was at an odd angle and his leg was a solid, all-consuming ache. Last thing he remembered was waging war against a laptop in order to figure out where Other-Steve had disappeared to. Steve jerked fully awake. Which, unfortunately, meant he jerked himself right off of the couch he&#39;d been asleep on and onto the cold, hard floor with a loud <i>thump</i> and a strangled curse.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He really should be used to waking up in strange places by this point, Steve mused, blinking up at the dark, familiar ceiling for few long moments. He heard a distant grumble and the scuff of bare feet on that same cold floor as he mentally thanked the couch for not being all that far from the ground.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Comfortable?&rdquo; </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve tilted his head back until he saw bare feet attached to a pair of pajama pants, a t-shirt tight against a broad chest, and Danny&#39;s upside-down face. He blinked a few times, glanced at his surroundings.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">There&#39;s a whole warren of dust-bunnies under your couch. They should probably be dealt with.&rdquo; He said feebly. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Is that why you came over and broke in to my apartment, to diss my housekeeping skills? After disappearing mysteriously from a hospital bed without a word to <i>anyone</i>?&rdquo; Danny crossed his arms.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Well, if Steve <i>was</i> just having delusions and hallucinations, then at least he wasn&#39;t falling into a stupor or going comatose. That was good, right?</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">I...had to tie up a few loose ends,&rdquo; Steve said, then wondered if <i>every </i>Danny made that face when he used the phrase. Then he realized that it might also have something to do with him still lying flat on his back in the floor. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He sat up, then took Danny&#39;s hand to get to his feet, then promptly dropped back onto the couch with a groan. His leg was not very happy with him.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">I&#39;ll get you some painkillers,&rdquo; Danny muttered, then stopped halfway out of the room and turned around. &ldquo;Don&#39;t move. Couches can be tricky; I don&#39;t want you to wind up in the floor again.&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Bite me,&rdquo; Steve said to Danny&#39;s retreating back, but didn&#39;t think Danny would reply. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He heard a quiet &ldquo;Maybe later,&rdquo; from the other room, muffled by the sound of pills being being jangled around .</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve took Dr. Danny&#39;s recommended dosage, then relaxed back into the cushions of the couch. Then he bolted upright so quickly Danny threw his hands into a defensive position and made a very undignified noise that Steve would make fun of later.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">What?

To be fair though, dealing with one reality was hard enough, but <i>two</i>...If that crap didn&#39;t stop soon he was gonna have to start taking notes or risk losing his mind. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Mags?&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Margaret Green.&rdquo; Steve said, &ldquo;The Tooth-Hunter&#39;s accomplice.

Danny led/pulled him away from the living room and the exit where they <i>should</i> be heading.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve hummed an affirmative, though he wasn&#39;t really listening.

And I don&#39;t want any lip about it, since you obviously can&#39;t be trusted with the couch.&rdquo; Danny grumbled the last bit, but Steve could hear a fuzzy lilt of amusement to his tone. Or maybe it was the medication. Probably was.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Why didn&#39;t you tell me this before I got you high,&rdquo; Danny muttered, dropping him unceremoniously on his bed.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Forgot,&rdquo; Steve said groggily, snagging a pillow and toeing off his shoes as Danny grabbed his phone from the nightstand. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Of course you did.&rdquo; He turned to his phone, then hesitated. &ldquo;Don&#39;t fall out of bed and hurt yourself.&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">No promises,&rdquo; Steve said without opening his eyes.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Goof,&rdquo; Danny said, shaking his head.

He blinked a few times, trying to brush off residual grogginess, and remembered where he was. He sat up suddenly, and noticed Danny standing in the doorway, propped against the frame.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Danny straightened up quickly and walked in, on the pretense of grabbing a tie from his closet.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Morning,&rdquo; Steve said, rubbing his face.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">I am so glad you didn&#39;t say <i>good</i> in front of that,&rdquo; Danny grumbled, focused on adjusting his tie.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Long night?&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Yes.

Steve took a sip and repressed the urge to moan wantonly as the delicious nectar of the gods passed his lips. Then he noticed Danny was being quiet. Never a good sign.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">What&#39;s wrong?&rdquo; Steve asked, taking in the pissy hands-on-hips posture and the annoyed tilt to his lips that meant Danny was gearing up for ultimate bitch-out mode.

He slipped into Steve&#39;s personal space, nothing odd there. But then he leaned close, chests pressed together and Dany&#39;s hand on the small of his back close, and Steve felt like he&#39;d missing something very important. The feeling only grew stronger when his neck was tugged down and...yes, that had definitely been a kiss. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Woah,&rdquo; Steve said because he&#39;d apparently forgotten every real word in existence. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Danny tilted his head. &ldquo;What, bad breath?&rdquo; He tested, hand to his mouth, then shrugged. &ldquo;I just smell coffee, babe.&rdquo; </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">No, it&#39;s&mdash;uh.&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Now are you going to tell me why you didn&#39;t come home last night?&rdquo; Danny pulled away slowly, going from warmly affectionate to irritated without any rational transition in between, as far as Steve could tell.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">I didn&#39;t make it that far.&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Danny huffed. &ldquo;You go <i>out of town</i> for a week, and then head straight <i>here</i> when you get back.

It was Hell, but it wasn&#39;t a thing compared to what <i>they </i>were feeling. Times like those, times like today, he had to fight to keep control. To keep from giving in and letting Danny take the reins and using his soft-sincere voice to offer condolences and make promises he hoped they could keep.

They pulled up to the most recent victim&#39;s house. The twenty-something guy with the neck tat. Joey, that was his name. He still lived with his parents, and Steve briefly wondered if he&#39;d misjudged the kid&#39;s age.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Turned out, yeah he did. He had still been a teenager, poor kid (tattoo must&#39;ve been got with parental permission). But lucky for them, the parents had been paranoid (just not paranoid enough). When Joey&mdash;Steve&#39;s heart went out to the mother when her voice broke, just saying his name&mdash;didn&#39;t come home the night before last, they&#39;d tracked the GPS on his cellphone. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He mutely questioned their judgment in going to the location alone, but that couldn&#39;t be helped now. It was in the middle of the woods, around a twenty minute drive away, and the mother&mdash;Mandy, Steve corrected himself, Mandy had went out looking for her son. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">When she&#39;d found the cell and not the son, that&#39;s when her husband had called the cops. Too little too late. His body was found a few hours later. This tooth fairy bastard worked fast.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve doubted it would come to anything, but he wanted to go to the location and do a quick sweep. Just in case HPD had missed something.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">~~~</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve let Danny&#39;s incessant ranting about disease-infested biting insects and ferocious predators fade to white noise, constant and faintly irritating in the background.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">You know,&rdquo; he said eventually, distracted by a set of fresh boot tracks in the dirt. He knelt to study them. &ldquo;If there<i> are</i> any &#39;ferocious man-eating beasts&#39; out here, as you said, your bitching is probably just as good as a dinner bell.&rdquo; He turned, grinning, and waited for Danny to explode into another laundry-list of complaints about his sanity and their current situation.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">But he was met by silence, and no Danny in sight, just brush and brambles and tree trunks. Steve got to his feet, looking around; he thought Danny was just behind him. He hadn&#39;t been <i>that</i> distracted, had he?</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve jumped, felt a sharp sting at his neck, and jerked the thin metal dart out of his skin. He stared at the ridiculous green fuzzy thing on the end of it for a long moment before staggering around a step, hearing a triumphant whoop over his head, and looking up. His vision blurred, almost doubled, but he saw a distinct set of pearly white teeth in a tanned face. The owner of the teeth and the face scrambled down out of the tree.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Thought I might get lucky, find some good game poking round here; preying on the weak&#39;s getting boring.&rdquo; Shiny-teeth said, &ldquo;You look like a challenge.&rdquo; </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve stumbled a few more steps and leaned, trying to prop on a tree, but he misjudged the distance and grabbed at thin air. Steve got the breath knocked out of him as the ground rushed up to meet him. A leaf crackled in his ear as he shifted his head, but it sounded distant. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Shiny-teeth snorted, and Steve blacked out.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Or maybe not.&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">~~~</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve woke slowly, consciousness teasing him doggedly, then slipping his grasp. When he finally got the strength to open his eyes, he quickly squeezed them back closed against one hell of a headache. He went to rub a hand over his eyes, but his arm wouldn&#39;t cooperate, tugging impotently against the duct tape that had his arms bound behind his back. He shifted his weight and pushed off the floor, trying to get to his knees, but his limbs were heavy and awkward, and the room was spinning and tilting, making it a lot harder than it should have been.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Relax,&rdquo; a deep, feminine voice purred as Steve fell onto his back, wrenching his shoulders. A bony hand reeled him to his knees. &ldquo;We haven&#39;t even go to the fun part yet.&rdquo; Then Shiny-Teeth, Tooth-Fairy Bastard herself, rounded him and kicked him square in the chest, sending him reeling against the wall. Other than the boot-shaped bruise he&#39;d undoubtedly have tomorrow, it was an improvement. His arms were still penned behind him, but at least he was sitting upright. And his vision was clearing.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He glanced around, then shook his head and did it again when all he saw was black shadows against gray.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">They were in an old building, ceiling tiles broken and leaking tufts of insulation down into the broad, open room they were in now. Long-abandoned by anyone other than TFB, judging by the scuffed up coating of dust over the floor. Too small to be a warehouse (with a few corridors splitting off of their current room, which Steve assumed was the entryway), but too big and empty to be anything non-commercial. He did a mental inventory and, no, he didn&#39;t have a damn clue where he was. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He looked for windows, but they were too high on the wall to be useful from his current position. All he saw was a filmy-gray tinted section of clear sky.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">She saw him looking around.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3""><i>Normally</i>,&rdquo; TFB said, sounding a little irritated, &ldquo;I&#39;d be doing this part of the hunt outside. Getting closer to nature, honing my instincts, y&#39;know.&rdquo; She turned her back to Steve, rummaged in a case he hadn&#39;t noticed in the shadows against the wall. &ldquo;<i>But</i>,&rdquo; she pulled out a crude bow, a little twisted and obviously handmade, but deadly, &ldquo;that&#39;s out of the question now, thanks to interfering parents who don&#39;t know how much of a brat their little boy really was.&rdquo; She frowned, then slipped a quiver of arrows over her back. &ldquo;It&#39;s a bitch to find a new hunting ground, y&#39;know.&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Where&#39;s Danny?&rdquo; Steve asked, because he was certain she&#39;d picked Danny off right before him; it&#39;d explain the sudden silence he hadn&#39;t noticed until it was too late. And it worried him that there was no sign of anyone else in the room, with only the one line in the coating of dust to signify a body being dragged. He&#39;d give TFB one thing, she was strong. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He noticed the corded muscles in her arms as she shrugged. She&#39;d been using a bow for a while, then.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He wasn&#39;t a keeper,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so I threw him back.&rdquo; Like his partner was a goddamn fish. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve glowered, felt a rush of irritation stronger than he&#39;d felt towards TFB so far.<i> What the hell&#39;s wrong with Danny?</i> Then he realized that <i>maybe</i> it was a good thing, or else they&#39;d <i>both</i> be trapped here. <i>Serial killer, dumbass</i>, a little voice in the back of his mind (that sounded suspiciously <i>like</i> Danny) said.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve schooled his face back from <i>fuck you and the horse you rode in on</i> to mild interest. &ldquo;So, why&#39;d you do it?&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Nuh-uh,&rdquo; TFB said, waggling her finger at him. &ldquo;My game, my rules. And rule numero uno is <i>shut the hell up</i>.&rdquo; She strung her bow, tested it. &ldquo;You have the count of eight until I start shooting.&rdquo; She knocked an arrow.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3""><i>So much for that</i>. Steve used the wall at his back to lever himself to his feet, then he did the only thing he could do, with an arrow pointed at his chest. He took off.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He zigzagged, trying to make himself a harder target, and took off for the first hallway he saw off of the main room. TFB had only got to &#39;seven&#39; when he felt a sharp impact, then his leg gave out as he dodged around the corner.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">She cheated,&rdquo; he panted aloud, &ldquo;the bitch cheated.&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3""><i><b>Serial killer, dumbass</b></i></font></font><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3""><b>.&rdquo; </b>Came louder, more insistent (and possibly from right over his shoulder) as Steve took a half second to asses the damage. Then he felt his arm jerked around a set of broad shoulders and his balance was tipped in the other direction. He was drug out of the way, biting back a few choice, colorful words as his leg was jarred, jostled, and generally treated more roughly than it had any right to be.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He was a little lost as he watched a blur of black uniforms rush past them, Chin hesitating for a moment to clap him on the arm and Kono sparing him a glance, before he and Danny were past them, out in the blindingly bright sunshine. He didn&#39;t hear any shots fired, so he assumed the take-down was going smoothy (so far) so he let himself give in to the temptation to drop, Danny easing him down, against the outer wall.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">He stared at the arrow jutting out of his thigh. It hadn&#39;t pierced deep, thanks to the weak, homemade bow (and the fact that TFB liked to toy with her victims), but that didn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t hurt.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br />&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">I do not like that woman,&rdquo; he said, going for Understatement of the Year, thankful that adrenaline had wiped away the remaining cloudy effects of the drug she&#39;d used.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Danny grinned, more relieved than amused. &ldquo;I&#39;m tempted to give her a root-canal myself, babe. You okay?&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve huffed a laugh, &ldquo;Yeah, I&#39;m fine.

He opened his eyes to see a uniform glaring down at him. Steve blinked a few times, then noticed corded arms straining the sleeves of a uniform unevenly buttoned in haste, tanned skin, and wide lips that he knew would part to show off shiny-white teeth.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3""><i>How the hell&mdash;</i></font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">But Danny was already walking back over quietly, hand on his gun, at the look on Steve&#39;s face. He wasn&#39;t quick enough. Danny drew and she kicked the gun away in a move that made Steve jealous, then hit him solid with a roundhouse, throwing him off balance. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Turns out, she hadn&#39;t though that part through, because it sent the gun skittering towards Steve, who lunged and grabbed it and shot her in the leg. He followed her down with the gun. Turnabout was fair play. TFB was lucky he hadn&#39;t gone for the head-shot. </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Danny wrestled her over and cuffed her, then turned to Steve, winded and hair askew. But Steve didn&#39;t notice. He was too busy staring down at the arrow that had gouged deeper into his leg when he went for the gun. He felt a roil of nausea as his vision tunneled down to black. All this passing out stuff, it sucked.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><br /></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">*** </font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">(Alt.1)</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br /><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font size=""3"">Steve jerked upright, smacked his head on glass, and was halfway out of the car before he realized he&#39;d been reclining in the Camero, apparently asleep.

  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">~~~</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Kurt dropped his
  bag onto a bench in the deserted locker room.  He thought it was
  deserted, at least, until he noticed the sound of a shower running
  and a deep voice crooning a familiar song.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	You give me fever - when you kiss
  me, fever when you hold me tight</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	Fever - in the the morning, fever
  all through the night.</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	Everybody's got the fever, that is
  something you all know</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	Fever isn't such a new thing, fever
  started long ago.<br /></i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Kurt inched his
  way forward, intrigued.  The voice was kind of familiar.  He peeked
  around the corner and dropped his jaw.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a
  very mad affair</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	When her Daddy tried to kill him,
  she said &quot;Daddy-O don't you dare&quot;</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	He give me fever - with his kisses,
  fever when he holds me tight</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	Fever - I'm his Missus, Oh daddy
  won't you treat him right.</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">He stared,
  slack-jawed, just listening to the deep, soothing voice for longer
  than he would care to admit.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	Now you've listened to my story,
  here's the point I have made:</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	Chicks were born to give you fever,
  be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	They give you fever - when you kiss
  them, fever if you live and learn</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Kurt finally
  regained normal brain function, at least in part.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	Fever - till you sizzle, what a
  lovely way to burn</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>	What a--</i></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><span style=""font-style: normal"">	&ldquo;Karofsky</span><i>?</i><span style=""font-style: normal"">&rdquo;
   </span><i>So much for normal brain function, </i><span style=""font-style: normal"">Kurt
  thought, trying to figure out what possessed him to blurt out the
  name instead of retreating silently from the room.  His mind was
  unusually blank in regards to that subject.</span></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Karofsky spun
  around, slipping on the wet tiles, and had to grab the sides of the
  stall to keep from falling.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;Hummel!  What
  the hell are you doing here?&rdquo;  Karofsky shielded himself from sight
  using the side of the shower stall, even though his modesty was
  already safe from Kurt's gaze.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Kurt found
  Karofsky's look of abject terror sadistically amusing.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;What is it,
  Karofsky?  Afraid I'm gonna take a 'peek at your junk'?&rdquo;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Karofsky glared at
  him, but didn't answer.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;I have gym
  class,&rdquo; Kurt answered Karofsky's earlier question to break the
  awkward silence.  &ldquo;I try to get here early.  The locker room isn't
  a fun place for 'the gay kid'.&rdquo;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Karofsky nodded,
  not looking at him.  Kurt knew that Karofsky had probably mercilessly
  teased other guys the same way he had been in locker room situations.
   That was just so&mdash;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">As Karofsky turned
  off the shower, wrapped a towel around his waist, and stepped out of
  the stall, however, Kurt's train of thought was derailed on its way
  to anger-town.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><span style=""font-style: normal"">	His
  first thought as Karofsky walked past him in nothing but a towel
  (ignoring him completely), was embarrassing and highly inappropriate
  considering how much of a jerk Karofsky'd been to him.  He'd thought
  </span><i>niiice, </i><span style=""font-style: normal"">followed
  quickly by </span><i>I'd tap that.</i><span style=""font-style: normal"">
   Kurt felt his face flush even though he hadn't said anything and his
  reaction was just a knee-jerk response.   </span></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><span style=""font-style: normal"">	And
  since when was he in to the big jock type?  He'd never...but that
  wasn't quite right.  He did have a thing for Finn at one point.  </span><i>But
  Finn never threatened your life!</i><span style=""font-style: normal"">
   </span></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">The threat still
  worried Kurt.  Karofsky had sounded downright menacing, but the fear
  in his eyes and that manic hint of desperation worried him even more.
   Kurt believed that it was an idle threat, but he couldn't be sure. 
  It was true that Karofsky had eased up on pushing and physical
  violence in the past few days, but that didn't mean that he wasn't
  worried.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><span style=""font-style: normal"">	</span><i>And
  what in the world was that wink all about?</i><span style=""font-style: normal"">
   Kurt had been puzzling over it for days.  Either Karofsky was using
  it as another way to taunt him, or it was some weird, twisted form of
  flirting.  Kurt didn't know what to think.  Karofsky was just so hot
  and cold, pushing, kissing, flirting, death threats.  Maybe he just
  had multiple personalities...</span></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;Hummel, you
  over there whacking it while picturing me naked or something?&rdquo; 
  Karofsky called from behind the stand of lockers.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><span style=""font-style: normal"">	&ldquo;Why
  must you be so crude?</span><i>&rdquo;</i><span style=""font-style: normal"">
   Kurt walked around in time to see Karofsky zipping up his jeans. 
  Kurt moved his gaze up Karofsky's bare torso to his face.  He gave
  Kurt a calculating look, then shrugged.  </span></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;It's just the
  way I am.&rdquo;  He said, then sat on a bench and reached for his socks.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Kurt noticed that
  Karofsky seemed more relaxed than normal, and decided to push his
  luck.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;I didn't know
  you could sing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Karofsky leaned up
  from tying a shoe.  &ldquo;I'm okay at it, I guess.  I just like to sing.
   It helps me...forget life for a little while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;Okay?  You
  sounded great!&rdquo;  Kurt sat down next to him, enthusiasm overpowering
  common sense.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">When Karofsky
  leaned down to put on his other shoe to cover up the fact that he was
  smiling, Kurt tried not to look too surprised.  Karofsky wasn't
  scowling or making threats.  It was a miracle!  He noticed a clump of
  soap suds on Karofsky's shoulder and reached to wipe them away.  He
  felt Karofsky freeze under his touch, then moved his hand away as he
  straightened up.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;You really
  think I'm that good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><span style=""font-style: normal"">	Kurt
  nodded, thinking Karofsky looked different.  That ever-present cloud
  of anger had faded into the background and with out it he looked
  real, human.  And a little vulnerable.  </span><i>Apparently music
  does soothe </i><span style=""font-style: normal"">this </span><i>savage
  beast, at least,</i><span style=""font-style: normal""> Kurt thought. 
  If this was how he always acted after singing, Kurt would start
  carrying sheet music with him everywhere...</span></p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo;
  Karofsky ducked his head self-consciously.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Kurt noticed a
  bead of water slide down Karofsky's neck and chest, hesitate for a
  moment, then run down his abdomen to pool in his bellybutton.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;You're...dripping,&rdquo;
  Kurt said, suddenly finding the floor very interesting.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;And you were
  staring.&rdquo;  Karofsky grabbed his towel, ran it over his torso, and
  tossed it to the side, all without looking away from Kurt.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Kurt wanted more
  than anything to be childish and say 'Was not!&rdquo; but he didn't. 
  Karofsky was actually smiling at him, cheerful and a little teasing. 
  He found the look irresistible and found himself acting before his
  brain had time to catch up.  He promised himself that he would asses
  the wisdom of his actions later.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Kurt leaned over,
  tilted Karofsky's chin with with forefinger and thumb, and kissed
  him.  When he pulled away, Dave murmured against his lips.</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&ldquo;Not your type,
  my ass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">&nbsp;</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"">Fin</p>
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal""><br />&nbsp;</p>

   <br /><lj-cut>Puck wrapped his arms around Kurt's waist, feeling the soft, smooth texture of designer fabric over Kurt's slender frame.  He pulled Kurt tight against his chest, reveling in the feeling of closeness and comfort.  He bumped his chin against Kurt's head.
   <br />
   <br />He inhaled in the floral scent of Kurt's shampoo or hair product, and caught a hint of spiciness that must be Kurt's expensive cologne.  <i>As girly as Kurt dresses most of the time,</i> Puck mused, <i>he smells totally like a dude.</i>  He allowed himself a moment of silence, of stillness, as Kurt finally relaxed in his arms.
   <br />
   <br />Then, with the help of one of his football buddies, Puck hefted Kurt up in his arms and tossed him in the dumpster.  As spluttered insults echoed out of the dumpster, Puck's buddy high-fived him (<i> When did that start being cool again?</i>) and caught up with another group of jocks across the parking lot, running from the scene of the crime.
   <br />
   <br />Puck peered in the dumpster, ducking quickly as a plastic bottle zoomed through the air where his head had been moments before.  He looked back over the side, smirking as Kurt glared up at him and yelled &ldquo;I hate you Noah Puckerman!&rdquo; while kicking away a bag that was filled with rotting food and coffee grounds, if he were to judge by the smell.
   <br />
   <br />&ldquo;Later, Kurt,&rdquo; Puck murmured.  
   <br />
   <br />He took off at a trot towards the school building.  One day, instead of dumpster-tossing him, Puck would turn Kurt around in his arms and kiss the hell out of him.  And since he was such a stud, Kurt would just melt against his body, grasping one of his awesome guns for support, and kiss him back.
   <br />
   <br />Until that day, though, no one would be the wiser.</lj-cut>"

"event","Title: The Importance of Bathing<br /><br />Disclaimer: I do not own Zombieland or any of the characters or situations therein.<br /><br />Rating: PG 13<br /><br />Fandom: Zombieland<br /><br />Pairing: Columbus/Tallahassee<br /><br />A/N: Written kind of like a deleted scene from the movie, right after Tallahassee and Columbus found the Hummer. Con crit and feedback are appreciated.<br /><lj-cut><br />Tallahassee had finally given up firing the newfound guns wildly in the air. Columbus absently noticed the cease-fire, but still jumped Tallahassee pulled his door open. He spit out his jacket string and reached for his gun. He barely had a handle on it when Tallahassee pulled him out of the Hummer and steered him around the side of the shabby white house.<br /><br />&quot;Are we lucky, or are we fuckin' lucky?&quot;<br /><br />Columbus didn't know what the big deal was. Tallahassee had stopped him in front of a small, ramshackle building, a small utility shed by the look of it (and probably infested with zombies). He fidgeted, but stood alongside Tallahassee anyway, as he wrenched open the door with enough force to shake the whole structure.<br /><br />Surprisingly, it was zombie-free. Columbus just saw a big hole in the ground, surrounded by concrete, with a few pipes coming up into a&hellip;thing&hellip;and attached to what looked like a&mdash;<br /><br />&quot;It looks like a giant metal water cooler.&quot;<br /><br />Tallahassee winked. &quot;I hoped it would. Now, If I can just get this damn&hellip;&quot; He leaned over the small motor-like thingy, and started fiddling with something Columbus didn't really understand. Columbus turned his back after hearing a loud thump from the house. So he jumped, again, when a loud, metallic whirring split the silence, along with Tallahassee's whoop of victory.<br /><br />&quot;What the hell is that thing?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That, Columbus, is an Artisan Well and thanks to the Lord Above and James A. Dewar, the creator of the Twinkie, this place still has working electricity. Now, how do you feel about taking a bath?&quot;<br /><br />Columbus couldn't remember the last time he had been truly clean, not counting quick rinses whenever they found running water or his obsessive use of moist towelettes.<br /><br />Tallahassee took off for the front of the house, leaving Columbus staring at the motorized water pump. He caught up with Tallahassee in time to see him shove a shoulder into the front door. It burst open with a crack and a crash as the frame gave way. They stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the doorway.<br /><br />&quot;So it begins,&quot; Columbus muttered.<br /><br />They decided to split up in order to clear out the house more quickly. Columbus thought they were doing pretty well; he had shot a zombie in the head, then watched as it fell out the second-story window, and he'd heard a few shots from downstairs that reassured him that Tallahassee was kicking zombie ass.<br /><br />A few minutes later, Columbus was checking the closet in what appeared to be a little girl's room (if the frilly, bright clothes in the closet and the stuffed animals scattered throughout the room were any indication). He gave the plush squirrel an evil look and kicked it under the bed.<br /><br />Columbus heard a yell from downstairs. He tried to race back through the hallway and down the stairs, only to find himself flat on his face. He felt blood trickle from his nose as he twisted onto his back and scooted across the room, pulling a zombie from its hiding place underneath the bed by its grip on his ankle in the process.<br /><br />If he hadn't been fighting for his life, Columbus would have laughed. The zombie, bits of flesh peeling away from its fingertips and face, struggling to rid itself of a pink, flowery comforter that had come with it. As the zombie fought its blanket cocoon, Columbus managed to kick out of its grip and scrambled to his feet. He fired two successive shots into the zombie's head and just stared for a few seconds. Blood seeped into the pale yellow carpet, the pink blanket, and a plush unicorn that had fallen nearby.<br /><br /><em>Rule 34: Always check under the bed.</em> <br /><br />Another yell and round of gunfire reminded Columbus what he had been doing before his own attack. He checked his nose to make sure it wasn't broken, then rushed downstairs to see if he could help Tallahassee.<br /><br />He found Tallahassee in the bathroom, braining a zombie with a hand-held shower massager and cursing up a storm the likes of which Columbus had never heard. (Which was saying something, since he had seen a sailor taken down by a horde of ravenous zombies, cussing and fighting the whole way down.) Columbus shook his head to dislodge the mental image that went with that memory.<br /><br />Tallahassee took a deep breath, losing steam as the zombie stopped moving. &quot;You stupid, rotting, flesh-eating sack of shit! Why the tub? You had the entire house to choose from.&quot; He threw his makeshift club aside, and it thunked down into the bathtub, next to a gnawed carcass and twitching zombie with its head caved in.<br /><br />&quot;Well, so much for that idea.&quot; Columbus refused to look back into the bathtub.<br /><br />Tallahassee just snorted. &quot;Downstairs is clear.&quot; He wiped splattered blood from his hat and stalked out of the bathroom. Columbus followed.<br /><br />Tallahassee suddenly turned around, causing Columbus to stumble against him. &quot;What happened to your face?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Zombie.&quot; Columbus wiped at the congealing blood on his face.<br /><br />Tallahassee rolled his eyes, &quot;I'm shocked to hear it. It's just that I've never known a zombie to take the time to punch someone in the nose. Bite off the nose and eat it, yeah, but&mdash;&quot;<br /><br />Columbus sighed and explained what happened. To Tallahassee's credit, he didn't laugh. Too much.<br /><br />&quot;Shut up. If you hadn't been yelling like a psychopath and distracted me&mdash;&quot;<br /><br />Tallahassee narrowed his eyes and gave him a hard look.<br /><br />&quot;Okay, never mind. Let's just go upstairs and look for another bathroom.&quot; They heard a few muffled noises from upstairs. Tallahassee grinned, checked his gun.<br /><br />Columbus winced. &quot;Please don't say it&hellip;&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Time to nut up or shut up.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It physically hurts my ears when you say that,&quot; Columbus muttered.<br /><br />They thudded up the stairs, and Tallahassee took out one more zombie with ease before they found another bathroom. Columbus waited until Tallahassee had finished his victory dance, then headed into the bathroom.<br /><br />Tallahassee grabbed him by the shoulder, &quot;Woah, where do you think you're going?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;To&hellip;take a shower.&quot;<br /><br />Tallahassee just looked at him. Columbus shrugged off his hand. &quot;Fine. Go ahead. But all this alpha male crap's getting annoying.&quot; Tallahassee gave him another death-glare, but for once, Columbus stared right back. Tallahassee cocked his head to the side, then laughed. He pushed Columbus into the bathroom. &quot;Go ahead, if you're gonna be such a drama queen about it.&quot;<br /><br />Columbus was very mature. He said, &quot;I will,&quot; and slammed the door in Tallahassee's face. He had never had a more wonderful shower, the hot water washing away grit, grime, and gore. He sighed and, for a few minutes, tried to forget that everything had gone to hell. Every once in a while he would hear the clack of Tallahassee's boots as he prowled the house. Columbus found the sound strangely reassuring. He smiled to himself as he heard Tallahassee first shoot, then yell out a nearby window. No doubt drawing the attention of more zombies to the area.<br /><br />Columbus felt oddly peaceful, even as he pulled back on dirty clothes and tried to ignore Tallahassee banging on the door.<br /><br />&quot;About time! I was starting to think that somehow you managed to drown yourself in the shower.&quot;<br /><br />Columbus snorted, feeling daring. &quot;And you say I'm the drama queen?&quot; Tallahassee ignored him and went into the bathroom.<br /><br />Columbus' inner peace was quickly shattered when he looked through the now-broken window that Tallahassee had been yelling through a little earlier. He saw a zombie splayed on the road below, leg still twitching though it's brain was splattered on the asphalt.<br /><br />A zombie had shuffled up the driveway, making for the front door so Columbus took aim, but he pulled the gun back in the window, careful of the shards of glass still sticking out of the frame, at a noise much closer. He heard a second bang followed by shuffling footsteps on the stairwell. He tightened his grip on the gun and waited for the zombie to come into sight. He didn't have to wait long.<br /><br />The first thing he saw was a bloodied hand on the banister, followed by a grotesque monster that had probably been an avid golfer at one point in time, if his ridiculous outfit was anything to go by. Columbus didn't panic. He took aim and pulled the trigger.<br /><br /><em>Click.</em><br /><br />&quot;Shit!&quot; That just wasn't like him. He'd forgotten to load his gun. He backed up a few steps and checked his pockets.<br /><br />&quot;Oh, shit.&quot; His ammo was still in the bathroom. He took off down the hall, zombie-golfer-guy not far behind. He was screwed if Tallahassee had locked the door. He collided with the bathroom door, then heaved a sigh of relief as the door swung easily open; he slammed and locked it behind him. He leaned against the door, eyes closed, and tried to catch his breath.<br /><br />Columbus heard a long-suffering sigh from the direction of the bathtub, but resolutely did not look in that direction. He busied himself looking for his ammo and most definitely did not take a sidelong glance at the man that had just stepped out of the tub and stood dripping on the tile floor.<br /><br />&quot;That-that could be a safety hazard,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Tallahassee snatched a towel and dried off, grumbling all the while. &quot;Cain't even have a nice soak in the tub without you trying to jump into my hip pocket. Not that I have a hip pocket at the moment.&quot; He held his arms out from his sides, as if to say 'see?'.<br /><br />Columbus swallowed, and went back to loading his gun. &quot;Yes, I can see that, but there's a&mdash;&quot;<br /><br /><em>Thwack.</em><br /><br />The bathroom door trembled under the impact, and Columbus jumped away from it, slipped on the wet tile, and fell against Tallahassee in the cramped bathroom. He felt a steadying arm around his shoulders, and Tallahassee smirked at him before righting him and grabbing his own gun off the toilet. Columbus muttered an apology, and Tallahassee brushed back past him, hand on the door handle. He hoped Tallahassee would hurry up and put some clothes on. Him being naked was&hellip;distracting.<br /><br />In one fluid motion Tallahassee pushed open the door with one hand, knocking the zombie to the floor, raised his gun in the other, and shot it point-blank in the chest. His teeth were bared and there was a wild anger in his eyes, but Columbus didn't notice his expression.<br /><br />He was preoccupied, looking at Tallahassee's muscular shoulders, the line of his back, curve of his hip, and his rather attractive ass. Tallahassee's expression was back to normal, and a little smug, when Columbus finally looked up at his face.<br /><br />&quot;See somethin' you like?&quot;<br /><br />Columbus took an involuntary step back as Tallahassee moved towards him. &quot;What? No. I mean, you're a fine specimen of a human being, but&mdash;wait, what was the question?&quot;<br /><br />Tallahassee stepped a little closer, well within Columbus' personal bubble. He leaned in closer still. &quot;I asked,&quot; he said, &quot;if you saw something you liked.&quot;<br /><br />Columbus licked his lips, heart racing. &quot;I might have.&quot;<br /><br />Tallahassee pressed an awkward, and surprisingly gentle, kiss to his lips. Columbus relaxed a little. In one thing, at least (and despite outward appearances), Tallahassee seemed as nervous and unsure as he was. Well, that may be overstating things, Columbus thought, but at least he knew that Tallahassee wasn't Mr. Badass in everything he did.<br /><br />&quot;Is that the best you can do?&quot; Columbus murmured against Tallahassee's lips, evil little grin in place as Tallahassee pulled back to look at him. Tallahassee gave him a severe mock-glare.<br /><br />&quot;What do you mean, is that he best I can do? You're the one just standin' there like a knot on a log while I do all the wor&mdash;mmf.&quot;<br /><br />As Columbus curled a hand around Tallahassee's neck, he absently wished the man had at least some hair. He began to lose his train of thought as Tallahassee did show him his best, gently kissing and biting, his large calloused hands roving his body.<br /><br />Columbus' last though before Tallahassee did something wonderful with his mouth that clouded his ability to form coherent thoughts, was: <em>What is the point of surviving the zombie apocalypse if you're afraid to be a little adventurous?</em> He had to remember to add another rule to his list.<br /><br /><em>Rule 35: Try new things</em><br /><em><br /><br /></em>END<br /><br />*constructive criticism is always appreciated*&nbsp;</lj-cut>"

"event","&nbsp;Title: The Call<br /><br />Fandom: Lost Boys<br /><br />Rating: R<br /><br />Warning: Melodramatic? Neck biting, death<br /><br />Disclaimer: I do not own the characters within this story; this is for entertainment purposes only.<br /><br />Summary: David grows a conscience, for a little while. Michael checks on him.<br /><br />Notes: Just a quick little fic I wrote after watching the movie; comments and constructive criticism are appreciated. ((Now with fewer type-o's!))<br /><lj-cut><br />David studied the scene: a group of revelers circled a fire, a few perched on the hood of a car while others sat on the sandy ground or leaned against some of the trees scattered nearby. He noticed one man off to the side, separate from the group. He was staring into the darkness while the others talked over each other and laughed uproariously.<br /><br />David called the man to him, a soft whisper inside his mind beckoning him over and away from the fire. David stood in the shadows of the trees, hidden from the others, late-night revelers and vampires alike. The man rushed forward, long-legged strides putting him at David's side in seconds. David looked him over in the faint flickering light from the fire.<br /><br />He was tall, at least 6'4&quot;, a few inches taller than David, with a short stubble of dark hair over his head and jaw. His eyes flashed in the flickering light, but it was impossible to tell the color. He was smiling, bright and welcoming, as if David were an old friend returning from a long absence. He pulled David into a surprisingly strong grip and hugged him.<br /><br />David felt out of control for a second, wrapped in the arms of a man so much bigger than he was, all broad shoulders, huge biceps, and pure muscle squeezing him breathless. Just as suddenly, the man pulled away, but kept a grip on David's waist.<br /><br />&quot;I've missed you,&quot; the man murmured, staring into David's eyes. David smiled at him, flashing fangs, all predator, but the man didn't seem to notice. He just leaned down, tilting his head for a kiss. That surprised David, too; he'd invaded the man's mind, but hadn't put that much effort into capturing him. Loverboy must have had someone well-beloved on his mind when David had called to him. David hesitated a moment, then leaned up into the offered kiss. It was the least he could do before killing the man.<br /><br />Loverboy's stubble scraped against David's cheek, and his hand ran through David's hair. The man's body melded against David's as he kissed him. He pulled back from the kiss, and Loverboy took a deep gasping breath before resting his head against David's shoulder, putting his neck and collarbone in front of David's face. His body was warm, so warm, and his heartbeat was so strong that David couldn't resist. He heard Loverboy suck in a deep breath as his fangs punctured the flesh, then he was holding all that weight off the ground himself. David pulled away and looked into the man's eyes. Pale, they were blue or gray. He saw the light fade from those eyes, and they went glassy and lifeless. David felt his face crumple into an unfamiliar expression.<br /><br />No, that wasn't right, he couldn't be regretting what he'd done. He was a vampire; he'd killed and eaten countless victims without batting an eyelash. Why was this guy so different? David lowered the body to the ground, gently. Then he ran. He didn't know why or where, but he needed to get away. Away from what he'd done, away from his little gang of murderers. He ran, he flew, he only stopped when he reached the ocean. He stood in the sand and listened to the surf. Then he squatted down, elbows on knees, face in his hands. He took a few deep breaths of the tangy sea air. He heard the rustle of cloth, faint scrape of boot against sand. He stood and whirled around, ready to maim whoever had followed him. Not kill, he'd had enough of that for the night, but maim, that he could deal with.<br /><br />&quot;Michael,&quot; he muttered.<br /><br />Michael took a few steps toward him, but stayed out of arm's reach. Smart, very smart. &quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br /><br />David started to snarl at him, tell him it was none of his fucking business, but he just sighed instead, deep and world-weary.<br /><br />Michael took a few more tentative steps forward, and put a hand on David's shoulder, where his nameless victim had rested his head so short a time ago. David jerked away, but Michael followed. He was a persistent little fledgling, that's for sure. He didn't touch David again, but his brow was creased in worry, and his hand was reaching, as if he wanted to.<br /><br />&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; David growled, but Michael either had a death wish or just didn't care about the warning. He closed the remaining distance between them and grasped David's shoulder awkwardly, looking into his eyes.<br /><br />&quot;Checking on you,&quot; he murmured, glancing away and swiping a lock of hair out of his face. He looked back up at David, pale eyes bright in the moonlight.<br /><br />Pale eyes? Did he remind me of&mdash;no just a coincidence. David shook his head, trying to dislodge the memory of killing a man who had welcomed him into his arms. He leaned into Michael's touch absently, then made himself take a step back. Water splashed over his foot, so he glanced down. He'd stepped back into the ocean, water splashing over the toe of his boot and soaking up into the hem of his pants. He sighed and stepped back towards Michael, who was trying not to smile.<br /><br />&quot;Asshole,&quot; he grumbled, knocking away Michael's hand for the third time.<br /><br />Michael laughed, throwing back his head to the moon. He smiled at David, another reminded of his most recent victim. David turned back to the ocean, watching the waves crest and roll. He'd have to stop moping around like this; he did what he was made to do&mdash;what he had to do to survive. At least the man had died happy, which was more than he could say about most of his victims.<br /><br />Michael was watching him when he turned back around. He hadn't moved, which meant he was still standing too close, but David didn't seem to mind as much as he had a few moments ago.<br /><br />&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; David asked again, softly this time.<br /><br />&quot;The guys said I should follow you, check on you.&quot;<br /><br />David felt a rush of anger. They had given Michael as the proverbial lamb to slaughter. Or had they known he had a weakness for Michael and figured he'd be the safest? David didn't know, and couldn't bring himself to care. He would deal with them later, but for now...<br /><br />He looked Michael over. He was a little disheveled, but there was no spatter of blood on his clothing or scent of it around him.<br /><br />&quot;You haven't fed?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No.&quot; The single word was a challenge.<br /><br />The challenge to his authority irked David, but he was willing to let that go, for the time being. He had more pressing matters to deal with. He knew if Michael didn't feed soon, he'd lose him to Star and her gentler, more subtle form of manipulation. He thought quickly. Fresh human blood was flowing through his veins. If only...<br /><br />&quot;That's okay,&quot; he said, then put an arm around Michael's waist. Michael's eyes widened, but he smiled. &quot;Thank you for,&quot; David hesitated, &quot;checking on me.&quot;<br /><br />David leaned in, breath hot against Michael's lips, inviting him in. Michael covered the remaining centimeters without a thought, without hesitation, without mind-tricks. David steeled himself, he was making the right choice. He nicked his tongue on one of Michael's fangs. Oops, the trials of kissing a vampire, he thought deviously.<br /><br />Michael pulled away roughly, getting his first taste of blood. He looked into David's eyes. &quot;You bastard,&quot; he hissed, breathless.<br /><br />David just smiled. Michael pressed a hand to both sides of David's face and kissed him again. He lapped and sucked David's tongue, blood lust and true lust mingling and becoming one. They kissed until David felt his knees grow weak, and not from blood-loss. He felt tension building low in his body and felt Michael, hard and heavy, against his thigh. Only by using all of his willpower did David pull away, one hand below the waistband of Michael's jeans, cupping his ass and the other on his chest, pushing him away. Mixed signals? Maybe.<br /><br />David pulled away from Michael's body, feeling Michael's arms slide our from around him. Michael looked confused and a little hurt.<br /><br />&quot;Before this goes any further,&quot; David panted, &quot;why don't we find a bed? Or at least somewhere away from all the sand?&quot;<br /><br />Michael flashed fangs, smiling darkly, sending a jolt of prey-like fear, then arousal through David's body.<br /><br />&quot;Let's go,&quot; he said.<br /><br />And they disappeared from the beach in a billow of clothing and a spray of sand.<br /><br />TBC</lj-cut>"

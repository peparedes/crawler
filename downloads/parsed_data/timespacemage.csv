Man, it's been out for a week without me knowing... It's hard enough knowing that Pokemon Platinum was released in Japan already. I am really looking forward to playing this game when I get back to my room!<br /><br />I haven't been on much since internet is really expensive - I go online when I go to the library, but it's a 30 minute walk (or a quick ride if I can catch the shuttle). It's been really busy here and I&nbsp;have had a lot of things to do, but I'm getting classes in general electronics and the hands-on labs are really fun. The hardest part is that we get in a lot of trouble if we nod off in class, but our day starts before 4 AM and we're released around 5:30 PM. I still end up staying up late with homework, details or relaxing with my friends, so I don't get much sleep during the week. On the other hand, when we're sleepy in class we're allowed to stand up (out of everyone's way, of course).<br /><br />"

"event","Hi to alicornmoon and whoever else watches these entries. Starting tomorrow, I will be heading off to Lackland AFB (San Antonio) for Air Force basic training. Providing I don't get held back, I will be graduating on September 26th and going on to tech school in Keesler AFB (Biloxi, MS) and Sheppard AFB (Wichita Falls, TX). That will take up through next year, but after a month there I should have electronics/internet access again.

I'm going to be trained in Avionics Test Station and Components, which is about fixing the test equipment used to fix aircraft. From what I've heard it's a pretty nice job, plus there's all the military benefits like free medical/dental and college loan repayment programs. Anyway, you all take care and keep up your studies this fall!"

In the meantime, I'm preparing by gathering information and getting more in shape. I've already lost about 5 pounds and have gotten noticeably leaner, but gyms still aren't my natural environment =P

Anyway I started playing some old games lately (and picked up new ones), so the TV has been seeing some more time too.
-Final Fantasy XII
Finally started playing this - really like the Loot system since I'm a frickin pack rat. My party's Lv09-11 right now (about to get on Balthier's airship for the floating city) and we beat a Greeden and Nekhbet already at the cost of pretty much all of our supplies. I'm proud of pulling it off though, and it's mostly thanks to Dark and Protect.

-Mega Man Legends
3D megaman game for PSX - had to stop when my friend called though.

-Metal Gear Solid (PSX)
Snake's first big adventure, disregarding the 8-bit ones. I suck at stealth and have died 3 or 4 times on Easy so far, lol. I am getting better, anyway. I'm getting into the game so I can get to know Snake for Smash Bros Brawl, and so far there are some pretty funny conversations."

Anyway, the right side of the DDR pad's down arrow has been sticking lately, so I'm playing on the left again. The cardboard stabilizing the right side got moved, so I put it back while I was at it too; other than that I didn't have my calculator so I couldn't put down my scores. (Most of them had pad misses anyway, which made them high A's or low AA's instead of mid-range AA's).

This will hopefully lead to more reasonable high-end charts, considering DDR has what is known in some communities as a lot of ""bullshit 10's"". Also since he hangs out at <a href=""http://aij.ddruk.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=1"">AIJ</a> a lot, we can hear more from someone on the inside how everything works there. It turns out stepchart artists don't have all that much freedom making their charts, but they still have voices."

Woohoo!<br />The coolest thing I did after that was full-combo Hot Limit, a 733-note long version song. I turned around and there were like seven girls watching =o<br />Also, I've been getting AAs on doubles lately - it's a real mood-booster since I'm finding out I can AA songs without any mods. Once I get back in the fall, I'll be able to play more Oni courses (modless continuous play where you can't break combo more than three times) and get in even more songs per play. I wonder how long it'd take me to get through Dancemania -Oni-... Haha, I probably don't stand a chance yet even with my improved stamina.<br /><br /><br />Also for those interested, ZIV is making a <a href=""http://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v2/ddrgamedb.php?gameid=48"">songlist</a> of the songs that are available in the current DDR SuperNOVA2 location test. There're so many great songs coming in from the other BEMANI series (Bloody Tears, Blind Justice, CaptivAte) and so many new Konami Originals are coming in by those artists too, new <b>DDR songs</b> instead of being pulled in from another series! (SN1 examples of being pulled in: Xepher, DoLL, Red Zone, Drivin').<br /><br />Here're some vids of SuperNOVA2 to look at:<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy4OX8WoRC0"">Funny arrowskins</a> - Emi vs Rage arrows!<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGYvzC8jNWY"">More fun with arrowskins</a> - Tiny vs Vic Viper<br />&nbsp;<br /><b>NEW SONGS</b><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG4zKUdcjis"">Bloody Tears</a> by DJ Yoshitaka - Heavy 8, background video from Beatmania IIDX 13 Distorted. The song's originally from Castlevania!<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXoEtgpkwoE"">Blind Justice</a> by Zektbach - Heavy 8, background video from Beatmania IIDX 14 GOLD.<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUOBUtiYruI"">Saturn</a> - Standard 5.

It sounds really cool!<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a27pRy5rn6A"">Paranoia Hades</a> (Challenge 10). The vid's really off-sync, but it looks really good!<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOPEfiQBEA0"">NGO</a> - Heavy 9, Challenge 10. This song seems to have a real love/hate relationship. I like the song (yay electric guitar), but WOW that's a lot of jumps.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyFzc6YYsSs"">New Oni courses</a> - since this is a location test, the new songs in these courses aren't available for normal play. It makes people have to work a little harder to see the new stuff! Also note ""Grand Cross version GOLD"" at 00:16 - that's the planet-themed course I mentioned.<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEKOYDtB6Bs"">New Nonstop courses</a> - you'll want to pause the video when reading them. There are a LOT of really cool songs in here, some of which I haven't even heard yet =P<br />Also, nonstop difficulty changes are back to DDR Extreme-style; you can raise the difficulty of every song one level (so ""Normal"" or ""Difficult""). Thank goodness - this provides a lot more flexibility when playing. In case you have trouble reading the nonstop course listings, al2k4 has transcribed them all <a href=""http://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v2/viewthread.php?threadid=473"">here</a> for your perusing pleasure. Please note that there's a remix of L'amour =o<br /><br />...Ah. Apparently the location test machine has been reverted to Supernova1, but the marquis (giant banner on the top) still shows SN2. Now this is just a guess, but I think they're tweaking stuff."

"event","So, I finally got the nerve to call up Skip again. His assistant took my message and Skip just called me back - apparently he hasn't ordered SuperNova because he hasn't been impressed with its turnout. He said something about it not even being on the top 10 on a list, probably a popularity list for arcade games, and that there were mixed opinions - while some people liked it for being new, others preferred the old version (probably referring to Extreme).
&nbsp;
Also he talked about how business during the summer is slow (probably also referring to the ordering of kits), and I reminded him that SuperNova does have an upgrade kit as well as a full dedicab. On the other hand, he mentioned that there will be a trade show in September that he will attend, and its popularity there will affect his opinion of it. Looks like we won't be getting SuperNova for awhile still =P

But oh well. I let him know about the stuck arrow on the right side, and he said they'd come in to fix it next week. The assistant had said tomorrow, but for that matter Skip had apparently not been told anything other than that he was to call me back. *shrugs* =P

The thing is, though, the dining halls aren't open over the summer, so I don't have access to my unlimited meal plan. This is going to be the first time I'll be living off my own food stock or fast food for an extended period of time, plus I have very little experience cooking. Yeah I know, ""college students eat ramen""... I'm just worried about just how much I'll need to stock up, because my little cheese cracker packs and fruit bars aren't cutting it as far as filling me up. Oh well, it'll be a good experience for me - I was just thinking last night about how I shouldn't be taking my meals for granted anyway. I <i>was</i> smart and took some apples from the dining hall before it closed... should've made two or three more trips =P

The ""fun"" part is that I have three hours to move out of my dorm room, so I have to start packing up today. On the plus side, I'm going to be living right next to a good friend of mine, who has a car so we can go out to eat (heh). He's also been living there for like a year, so he's familiar with the building and can help get me acquainted.

I guess it's natural for me to get nervous about moving to a new place, even though I've done it lots of times. But yeah, at least I've got a job lined up that doesn't start with ""W"" and rhyme with ""al-Mart""."

It's Nightshade (Diskowarp Easily Amused Mix); I really like it.

Yeah it's been awhile since I updated my LJ. I've been really busy, again X)
Wednesday I went rollerskating with two of my friends. That was fun, though I fell down and my hands still hurt. 

On Saturday my parents and I headed up to St. Joseph to visit the arcade ""Memories Games"". They had pretty much every rhythm game I've ever wanted to try (aside from Pump It Up) so I felt a similar experience to a kid in a candy store. The staff was very knowledgeable about the games, too.
-DanceManiaX is a motion-sensitive game where you wave your hands above and below two receptors. I suppose if you wanted to freestyle, you could use other parts of your body too (like swinging your leg up and over), so I like its potential for that as well. I even got Mom and Dad to try it out, which was really cool since I never see them playing games. They liked it too, so I'm happy.

-Pop'N Music is a bouncy, colorful game played with large dome-shaped buttons. It was entirely in Japanese, since it's never been released in the States. However, one of the staff gave me a hand (plus 2 free games for hearing about the offer on ddrKC.us's boards!) and I got right into playing. I got my parents to try since the 3-button battle mode prevents failing on songs, and that was pretty interesting. Also I went right into the normal 9-button mode afterwards and got to play some familiar songs (as well as completely failing Love Love Sugar, but wow was it fun).
You can see videos of what Pop'N Music looks like here: http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Mokai
To see the controller, just run some searches for it on youtube.

-Beatmania IIDX (""two dee ex"") is a DJ simulator, where you basically get to use a sequencer to create music. There are seven rectangular keys (almost like piano keys, but separated from each other), and there's also a turntable to spin. It was frickin amazing to see one in person. There's a metal platform you stand on when playing, and since it's part of the machine you can feel the bass through your feet. I don't know how to describe the experience any better than that, but it was incredible."

Anyway, I'm going to become a grad student sometime this week or so once I get this one assignment taken care of. And this time, I'm NOT bringing my DS to school! When I came home for the weekend, practically all I did was play Pokemon Mystery Dungeon (super-addicting game btw) and the same thing would happen back at school.

Also about the last entry, before I left for break I cleared the Naoki Neo-Standard oni and got on the high scores list for the first time ^^

"event","Wow. It's like a foot deep out there and still blowing; I heard it's going to keep snowing 'til 6 AM too. I did ask for a white Christmas, and I guess I finally got it! It's been what, 2 years?

Also since it's Thursday night, everyone's out getting drunk as well. Here I am standing by the front door watching the snow, and all sorts of characters come by. Some of these characters are people I already know, only completely different because they're stone drunk.

There was a lot of ""interesting"" stories to tell too, though I stayed out of them as is my nature. There was this one guy who I guess needed a lift home, and the person on our end was having the hardest time trying to get him to say where he lived and to spell his last name. These other guys (thankfully not drunk) were gonna go out on a ""McDonalds run"" in their Chevy 4x4, but they got talked out of it in the end by someone else that had already tried that. Lots of people got stuck on the hills, too; I passed one by on my way to the Union (which as I could have guessed, was closed for inclement weather so I got to walk back). Oh, and all the people that didn't wear caps looked like they had grey hair. It was hilarious.

In other news though, I had a really great day today besides the snow I've been wanting for so long. In Networking, we learned about different protocols for getting local IP addresses wirelessly (aka MAC addresses). It was really neat learning which port numbers are used and how many bytes of data are transferred in such and such a way to mean a particular message - it was like learning to speak ""computer"" or something. The examples went into so much detail (for once!) that I started picturing the process as a minigame in Megaman Battle Network, where you might arrange the bits by hand (say pushing giant number blocks into place) and send the message to the server. I'd get into it in more detail, but I want to go on to the other parts.

In GIS (Geography Information Systems) class I was pretty fidgety from having that plate of pasta for lunch, so I left for the Union to burn off some energy. I played the Oni course ""Naoki Neo-Standard"", one of the easiest but that's not saying much. There were some other players there which I mention in <a href=ddr.ddrecall.com/user.php?user=3761>my Recall entry</a>; anyway I got to the last song of 5, which isn't playable in any other way. It was a new record for me and I got to play a song most people haven't on that machine, which made me feel really good. Next round I improved some scores, then played a really hard one (Burning Heat! 3 Option Mix) and raised my best score on it from a C to an A! Now I no longer have any C's for DDR Extreme, and my total Dance Points % finally broke 90%. I'm so happy ^-^

Also when I got back to the GIS lab, I was able to get some homework done as well as find out where I need to be in the class! I feel like I really can catch up in there, and it's one of the ones I was most worried about. I still have just as much work to do, but now I'm more worried about Networking and Databases because I have the most homework due for them.

Another thing about homework: I'm supposed to be graduating this semester. If I pass all of my classes then I'll be in the clear, but I'm not sure at this point whether or not that will be the case. To top it off, there's some things I have to do in preparation like pick up my cap & gown (no point paying for it if I end up not graduating, right?). Here's the issue though: I really don't want to leave college yet. This semester I made a ton of new friends, we could be getting DDR Supernova soon, and I really like this town. (Ironically, my sister is the opposite). I did figure out though, if I don't graduate then I could just take the next semester (assuming the classes will be offered and that I can take out a loan for that much by myself, neither of which I've found out yet). If I <b>do</b> graduate, maybe I <i>will</i> go on to graduate school since they have a Software Engineering program, and because by becoming a Grad Assistant it will pay for grad school. After that, the only option I've seen that will pay off the loans is to join the military. In a way, I'm also trying to put off making that decision because it would be starting a new phase in my life.

OK, now it's 2 AM and I'm hungry. I'll make some teriyaki rice and take a look at my Database homework while waiting for my roommate to show back up."

Also I got to see Skip again (surprise, surprise!) after my first class.

I also heard from him that he got a call in to a distributor, which hints that he's finally found a Supernova!

I feel a little guilty for not telling him about how some jackass had left mud (and a bobby pin) on the pads, but he -was- really busy. I'll just have to clean off the rest as best I can later with a good ol-fashioned spit shine.

After a few more questions, I figured out he didn't really know much about Supernova at all; he wasn't sure if it was another illegal bootleg like Extreme. I filled him in, saying it was indeed a completely new machine and an actual NA release, and that I played on it at Cool Crest in Independence and really liked it. I said that I knew people online that would be very happy to hear about getting a machine here, and he said he would definitely look into it if it was going to be popular; he also then said he would get an answer soon. Then I let him know how the pads on the Extreme were getting loose again and he thanked me. He had that and the broken driving game to work on (plus I missed breakfast thanks to my Snooze button only working 4 or so times) so I left for lunch.

Well, hopefully this will help get the game in! I wish I could play it at CMSU before I graduate in December (assuming I pass everything, damn senior-itis) because it's right there, and it's a frickin brand new machine! Without it, I just feel like this whole situation is unresolved somehow. I feel like it's something only I can help put into effect.

"event","I'm playing Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, this awesome game for the DS/GBA where you're a human that got turned into a pokemon. You travel to randomly-generated dungeons where you can collect items, fight other pokemon, and solve others' problems. Occasionally you can even convince other pokemon to join you after a battle, so it has the familiar ""catching"" aspect to it too. The battles are turn-based, but instead of everyone just standing still, you can move around on a grid system (similar to Advanced Wars or Final Fantasy Tactics). This means that different attacks have their own ranges - say Tackle will just hit the guy in front of you, but Earthquake will hit the whole room!

Anyway, I'm on this mission to escort this Nincada to B23 in Magma Cavern, and I keep messing it up. I got to like B22 but messed up my input and didn't manage to disable an Onix from KO'ing Nincada with Dragonbreath. Since you lose all of your money and most of your items when you fail a mission, I'm better off just resetting... thus starting over from the beginning of the dungeon. RAWR. What makes it really annoying is that you can't give it commands to manipulate where it goes (it'll attack any enemy next to it instead of getting the hell away) and you can't give it items, a good one being Revival Seed which essentially gives it an extra life.

Well on the plus side, my team Nachos is the second-highest rank in the game. Also I have near maxed out money and my leader's a Lv38 Bulbasaur, pretty sweet considering I haven't beaten the game (was at Lv31 when I beat it on the ROM). I like how my partner says hi to me every morning, but both he and the main character just become regular pokemon after beating the game and I don't want that to happen yet.

Also, these guys called Kecleons (a chameleon pokemon) run shops in the dungeons. I found out that if you grab an item, walk off the shop's carpet and refuse his request to pay for it, rather than take it back from you he labels you a thief. After that a bunch of Kecleons start flooding the level and kick your ass unless you make it to the stairs in time. I found out from an FAQ that they're Lv90 (compare to my Lv30-ish pair) and did around 90% damage to my partner with a weak attack. Then it used Substitute, which turned ME into a substitute doll, and my own partner started wailing on me instead! Gah.

So yeah, time to hit the stacks. I hope someone I know will come to the N64 party I'm having tomorrow."

Ahh, so many things have happened it's hard to know where to start.

I finally got a new laptop, which is working pretty well and it's definitely faster than my last one. Lots of the keys are in different places though so I'm slower at shortcuts, but at least it has a numpad! I just wish the media controls weren't F9 through F12; to use them I have to press the Fn key in the lower left, so I have to use two hands now instead of just pressing buttons on the laptop's face. Also they don't work with Winamp; I'll have to figure something out about that sometime.

I got a job at Wal-Mart over the summer as a cartpusher (pretty sure I mentioned this, but just in case). I thought I was going to be working in the back, but hey. If you ever apply to work at Wal-Mart as a ""stockassociate"", that's a <b>cart pusher</b>. Working in the back is <b>receiving</b>. The more you know!

This is my last semester before my bachelor's (assuming I pass everything), so the pressure's on. On the other hand, I only have 4 classes this time, yay! Three of them are computer science and one's statistics.

The DDR in the Union has really gone downhill; I can't even get AAs on my best songs anymore because the pad occasionally fail to register (and Misses hurt your score like crazy in DDR Extreme).

Lastly, there's a ton of new pokemon info out for Diamond and Pearl that I'll have to relegate to a separate entry. It's crazy, and it will turn your world upside-down.

This is a video of someone passing the song Chaos (and doing very well mind you) with decent-quality audio to boot. The impressive part about this is that Chaos is DDR SuperNOVA's OneMoreExtraStage.

What does that mean, you ask? Well on most machines you get three songs per play. If you play on Heavy and do very well on your last song (AA grade, 95%) you'll get a fourth song, Extra Stage. It's much less lenient on mistakes. If you beat Fascination MaXX or Healing-D-Vision (only available on Extra Stage), you'll get to play OneMoreExtraStage. OMES is challenging because you fail immediately if you hit even one step slightly off (Good/Boo/Miss, i.e. breaking combo). The song Chaos, as you can see, stops/starts like 60 times. Meaning you have to know when all those stops are =P"

Actually I spent a lot of today playing an RPG, Pokemon XD for the Gamecube. It's incredible as far as the pokemon games go, and it completely blows the previous GCN game (Colosseum) out of the water. The main improvement is to the gameplay, which is of course the most important aspect of a game. Pretty much every aspect I've seen so far has gotten a facelift; I'll go into detail since I don't feel like watching Adult Swim (who thought it would be funny for April Fools to insert fart sounds throughout all of their shows), and also because I want to take my mind off the fact that I lost track of time playing this game and missed dinner (i.e. it's late and I'm hungry).

In order to understand what impresses me about XD, you'll need to have some idea of how it's different from its predecessor Colosseum. I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum. Pokemon Colosseum takes place in the desolate region Orre, where conditions are too harsh...
*microwave dings*
Yay, my rice is done. There's one less distraction to worry about ^-^
Anyway as I was saying, the conditions are too harsh for pokemon to exist in the wild. As a result, the only pokemon around belong to trainers that moved to Orre from other regions. That's where the story comes in; two criminal organizations (Snagem and Cypher) are vying for control of the region, using machines that steal pokemon from their rightful trainers and machines that turn the little critters into heartless bastards good for nothing but fighting. One member of Snagem, the main character, decides to turn against them. On his way out destroying their base, he takes an arm-mounted Snag Machine (for stealing pokemon) with him. Some time later he meets up with a woman that can sense the auras of tainted ""Shadow"" pokemon, and the two of them end up combining forces to steal and purify the Shadow pokemon being created. This kind of story was a huge thing when it first came out, showing a rarely-seen dark side to the world of pokemon.

...Eh you know what, this is starting to drag on. I'm tired so I'll try to go faster.
Pokemon XD (aka Gale of Darkness) takes place 5 years after Colosseum, focusing on the young son of a pokemon researcher rather than a hardened veteran of a criminal organization. Still the basic gameplay is the same; you end up with a Snag Machine and ultimately have to go around recovering Shadow pokemon to be purified. Now normally during battles you want to fight as hard as you can, but catching pokemon is different since you can't catch them if they're knocked out (so you have to go easy on them while they get to wail on you full force). Together it makes an interesting experience where you have to be ready to disable Shadows and also beat the crap out of everything else by adhering to the game's strategy elements.

Okay, enough backstory. Things I like about XD, to the point because I like things that way:
- <b>Certain battle animations are mercifully shorter</b>, which makes battles not drag on as long.
- <b>Wide variety of battle music</b>! AHH! One of the most annoying parts of the original was that it used the same battle music for pretty much everything except major bosses, certain tournament matches and the last boss. This combined with the first one (battles taking less time to begin) really helps keep the pace of the game.
- <b>Better level design</b>. This is a big one. In the first game, the majority of the time was spent in long, drawn out levels filled with mostly unavoidable battles. Also remember that battles got tedious due to the above reasons. If you went through near to the end of a level and decided to leave the area to stay at a hotel or something, you come back and all of the trainers you spent forever and a half fighting are recharged too! Yes it was realistic, but it was a pain in the neck! It made you feel forced to do many things a certain way. In XD the levels allow you to skip a lot more battles if you want to, and the enemies don't reset when you leave and come back.
- <b>More character interaction</b>. Sometimes NPCs join you for a short while; this is something because in most pokemon games you're by yourself (as a silent hero) for the whole game. Colosseum had what's-her-name, but all she really did was support you and point out the Shadows. That and speak up every once-in-a-while. Having NPCs with you isn't quite up there with the idea of traveling as a small group with other trainers (which would be really cool), but it's getting there.
- <b>Sidequests</b>. Now I haven't played Colosseum in awhile, but I remember it being really linear. This game is pretty linear too, but it gives you a lot more to do if you don't feel like continuing the story. There are even time-activated events that auto-notify you, so you can start something up and know when it's finished.
- <b>Minigames</b>. Thank you God. Colosseum didn't have 'em and it was a let-down. One of these is a series of battle event simulations (like Event Matches in SSBM) where you're put in a holographic simulator and have to win the battle, demonstrating knowledge of some often really off-the-wall information. You can find discs for the simulator in treasure chests and whatnot, which really appeals to me because I go nuts over collecting stuff.
- <b>There were some freakin' box puzzles</b>. DUDE. Also he could <i>hop down from the above walkway</i> to push the boxes in different directions. That is freakin' awesome.

Also what the hell was up with Adult Swim and that Chuck Norris cartoon? I mean, seriously.

Yeah. I'm going to bed.

This site currently has two subsites, one for DDR and another for ITG. Apparently they're going to incorporate Beatmania as well.

Anyway, my DDR profile is here: http://ddr.ddrecall.com/user.php?mode=viewprofile&user=3761
I haven't added all of my scores because I didn't memorize the number of Greats and stuff, but recently I've been carrying around a blank college-rule notebook to keep track of them with. It's cheaper than a digital camera =P

But yeah, almost all of the scores listed for the DDR songs are AAs and above, so even my best scores are near the bottom page because even though they're AAs, they differ by the number of Greats I got. I plan on getting even better using this site to help keep track of my progress. Also there's a feature where people can give you challenges to work on; dunno if any will do that for me, but I hope it's nothing way out of my league."

Steve, weren't you gonna give me a link or something?

I think I mentioned this, but maybe I didn't. In the spirit of Lent, I'm holding off on all video and computer games up to next week Saturday. It's something I'm trying to see if I can catch up on my homework, and also to see whether or not I'll lose my mind and gain millions of pounds from not getting to play DDR when I'm fidgety. GAH, it's really irritating! On the other hand it's sort of working because I have fewer things to do other than my homework, but I'm having trouble keeping myself off the internet. And when I do go on the internet, there's like 20 million places to check for recent news and people to remind I'm not dead and other people to help get through their games. I tend to forget some places like Livejournal, and I have trouble keeping on top of my mail too (geez).

On the plus side though, I got a Combinatorics assignment finished the day it was given (Tuesday), so now I don't have any HW in that class since it's due next Tuesday. On the minus side I have like 5 Operating Systems assignments to do. Yeah, there's something to work on.

I could've sworn I made a list of tough DDR songs I've passed/AA'd, but I can't find it anywhere on my hard drive. Oh well, I'll list them here.

On the left page <b>going clockwise</b> from the upper left is Manaphy, Buizeru, Perappu and Tamanta. All except the bird are pure Water types, and the bird is the first pure Flying type 0.0;

Out of those four, Buizeru (the sea weasel; the one waving) is my favorite."

"event","Nobody attended my tournament, except one guy that was just there to watch. After all that thought and effort I put into it, I figured I'd have at least 8 people, even 16. I don't understand what went wrong, and it's a little depressing because I was looking forward to it.

On the other hand, there was some kind of weird middle or high school science olympiad, and a bunch of kids were playing at the arcade so I spent a bunch of time teaching people how to play DDR. I impressed some people when I was playing (one said I was the best one there), though that's a given since I've been playing the game for a year now. The same guy said I should try entering tournaments in the KC area, but I'm not that good yet. I surprised myself when I almost passed Drop Out after playing Fantasy (by Melissa); I hadn't played Drop Out on Heavy before, but it was a lot easier to read than I thought. During the long run at the end I could read the notes fast enough to switch my footing, though I think I just hit the wrong ones (plus I probably failed back during the second jump-stream). It was fast, but it's not as hard as I thought it was.

Also I finally AA'd My Summer Love, but just barely. Full combo was something ridiculously low for a 9, like 250."

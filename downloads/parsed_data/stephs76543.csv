living on my own in Belchertown

A month bumming around Costa Rica, me and two rafting friends(marty and dom). What is our plan? where are we staying? how will we get around? these are all good questions.....that I just don't know how to answer.

None of this will hit me till next week some time. 

When I come back.... I may be looking into rafting prospects out west, Colorado perhaps?

"event","There's so much...just so so much (obviously it's been a fucking month)

I can't say enough about how I feel right now. If I had ten sets of hands to get everything down that I have in my head it might make sense, but I'll have to just do my best.

Last weekend: 
My first commercial trips, a fun time at Village Pizza(of course), even more fun at Lindsey's, more compliments from Frank than I knew what to do with. 

Wednesday: 
I finished up Lindsey's ""thank you"" frame. I loved it so much I wanted to keep it, but I didn't. I've been feeling extra crafty and I wish I had 1) the energy; 2) the time; 3) the skill; 4) the money to make all the things I think of, maybe I could contract someone to follow directions to make things for me. 

Thursday:
 Went to the Millers for a training day with Dave, Ryan, Marty, Sarah, Putnam, Peter and Myself. I had so much fun (almost on the level of Maine). I got tossed around like a ragdoll on several occasions. I R-1ed, my first time with a guide stick all year and it was fantastic. The fucking best was when everyone let me take a boat and guide through the Funnel. Yes I was hyperventilating, but I was having so much fun the entire time. It did make me kinda feel like my decision to give up guiding for the season was made in haste. 

Party at Marty's. Daydreaming about going to Chile for a 10 day raft trip on the Futeleufu   http://top5rivers.com/top5rivers.html  (Check it out if you know what's good for you!) With or without people I think I have to be there next winter. I know I say alot of things, a lot of big ideas, but this is amazing....and Zach Keir says I'd better get there soon because they're considering damming it soon. ""Come Hell or Fucking High Water"" I will try to make this happen. Slept there.

Friday: 
Thought I would be cleaing buses, but instead I went home. Glad I did because I had time in the afternoon to meet up with Kaylin to do some apartment talking. She suggested that we consider our options outside of Alpine Commons and it was amazing. Saw 2 apartments now on the ""No way in hell"" list and 2 houses on the ""This just so happens to be my dream house"" list. The one in Belchertown was ridiculous, it was built for drunk college kids. A whole side of the house is glass windows and doors, a huge deck, plenty of parking, a backyard big enough for a baseball stadium, a fire pit. Mary had been there last year and described it as ""the best hippie party she's ever been to"". Where do I sign up?? I meet with them tuesday maybe tomorrow. Kaylin's Aunt might also be willing to let us stay in her huge house in South Amherst. It's .....I can't think of another word but AMAZING. Our house would so win the ""which Crabapple employee has the best house"" competion. Because everthing is a competition. Then we had dinner. I miss the DC so much, but I do much better on campus as a visitor. Then over to Marty's to watch Elf and crash for the night. 

Saturday: 
The day was hectic and a source of tons and tons of stress, but I kept reminding myself that the day was only so long and i would be drunk very soon. i won't dwell on the negative. So moving on.....

Showered at Mary's, ate burgers at Marty's with Kaylin and Mark. Sare showed up later(found the house all on her own....crazy!) with Andy. Went to Tuba's where we worked on his two kegs. The sign he made was priceless ""Rules: #1 No Puking (Steph)"". We drank and had fun of course in our little bubble talking shop. We're ridiculous. I love it!!! Left there around 1:30 with Ryan. Went to sleep at Marty's. Woken up an hour later to Mark, Zach and Marty drunk as fuck. Well if you can't beat'em join'em So I told Zach to grab me a beer too cause round two just started. fucking like 2:30 in the morning we're firing up the grill for some burgers. Amazing!!! Didn't get sleep till 4am. Up for a day of work at 6:30. Woke the guys up, found Marty in the bathroom, went to work not hungover = SCORE!!!. 

Sunday:
I was determined to make the day better. Clean up my mistakes and pull it together. Everything went off with out a hitch. The pictures were nearly perfect, I wore shorts, it was sunny.....if only every day....
Sarah: ""Hey Steph can you make me not look so right?""
Me: ""I could flip the picture (mirror image like)""...............wow I thought that was hilarious......not so much? .........ok, I understand.

Post work shananigans in the parking lot, then Taco Bell with Marty and Kaylin. Way more shananigans there too. It's all documented, don't worry. ""Multiple Stripes, Multiple Colors, Multiple Widths!!!"" 



Now the sappy mess:
I'd have to pinpoint today as the first day this whole photo business thing started to seem like a good idea. I have been so worried that people....well not my close friends, but the not so regulars or random others would just assume I did all of this because I couldn't cut it as a guide, I was scared, I couldn't handle it, I didn't like rafting.....and so on. I din't know if I'd be appreciated or forgotten. I have to admit Lindsey was a little forgotten. It turns out we're just two different people and handle things differently and people aren't going to forget about me. Not when I'm in my little corner or driving hours and hours around Rt 2 by myself. I feel excellent about how people have responded to me and my new job. 

Also...

I realized today, while hanging out in the parking lot how much I love and adore and admire and (more words like that) the people that I work with. I think for most of my years there I have always felt on the outside , like everyone else was established and had a presense and purpose. I was just tagging along for the ride. And for some reason while we're trying to coordinate post work dinner plans, while laughing at Mary and Marty rake and shovel....I felt equal to everyone else, like I wasn't riding on coat tails. I've always depended on these people, not just the ones I talk to on a regular basis but everyone. Like maybe it wasn't just me depending on them but these other people might depend on me on a day-to-day or whatever basis. If I didn't have these people I'd be lost. That's not an exaggeration. I wouldn't have a place to sleep when I didn't feel like driving home, need a place to shower, someone to go to Taco Bell with. 

It's forever going to be a priority...this whole river thing I've gotten myself into. 
When I vacation - it will obviously be to a river.... Gauley 2005 and Chile 2006!!
Who will I go with - obviously someone I work with
When I pick some place to move - it will need to be near a river, so I can have a job....cause this 2.5 years of college aint gonna fly
Who will I live with - it better be someone that likes the river

Marty's said we're like family....I think it might even be tighter than that.

One last very important thing while I'm on this kick
I thought about a ton on my hour drive back to Westfield(which I'm not in often) I might have a one track mind and have most of my thoughts rooted in the Deerfield but there is one consistant thing that I can count on that dates back before CrabApple and Sare I thank you for being the one friend from my past that is there even if it takes weekly, semi-weekly arrangements to catch up. 



That's enough out of me"

I loved today!!

11:40am Met Kaylin to look at apartments

12:00pm Went to the apartment complex in NoHo

12:05pm Went to the correct apartment complex (drove across the street)

12:20pm Toured the place

12:40pm Decided it was <i>nice</i> but not <b>perfect</b>

1:30pm Had lunch at Worcester Dining Hall, compliments of Kaylin. 

2:00pm Decided we're going to nominate Marty as Massachusetts next Bachelor for Cosmo.

3:00pm Went in search of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition.....you're gonna have to ask to see it to find out why or buy a $6 copy on your own....DON'T WORRY IT'LL BE WORTH IT!!

3:45pm Went to Alpine Commons 

4:05pm Decided we liked it much better!! A ""must look at again!!""

4:20pm Dropped her off and saw Daniela and Matt

4:45pm Visited Sare at Old Navy

5:30pm Saw Amy Scully at Old Navy while I was talking with Sare

6:00pm Sat at Panera Bread to drink soda and read Cosmo

6:45pm Went to Christin's. She had presents for me!! Love it!! Thanks a bunch!

7:30pm Met Kaylin and Bob at Fatso's. They ate and I chatted

8:30pm Went grocery shopping and killed time in the grocery store. Decided I want to throw an ""adult-style"" dinner party in our new place.

9:10pm Had dinner with Sare at the Hangar. We dreamt about our future places to live.

11:15pm Back home 

11:30pm Went crazy on Facebook for a little

NOWam Bed



That's the play-by-play. If you weren't there, I wish you were.....let's do it again sometime

Tomorrow breakfast with Mom-Tard and the countdown to the last couple of days at AO (yikes!!) 


I love that photgraphy training starts next week. 

(Let's make a list!!)

Reasons I want it to be next week:
-It'll be a week closer to summer
-It'll be a week closer to my Birthday
-I will get to meet the rookies
-I will get to see everyone's run through the Gap
-I will get to learn how to take pictures
-Next week we'll get the sure-to-be-comical ""Sexual Harrassment"" speech
-I might get my sleeping bag next week
-I'll be getting paid!!
-Maybe it'll be warmer
-With money I might want to go shopping
-I might have a better idea of where we might be living
-I can daydream more realistically about how I want to decorate the ""new place""


The last entry I was thinking a lot about the far-far future, but I get really excited about thinking about the nearer future and that's a little easier to manage. Not that I'm going to stop coming up with crazy ideas, never!

BTW I love the new Norah Jones cd.....ever want to borrow it??"

So here's my plan! 
In mid March I start my stint as a photographer. 
As late as possible I give up my job at the shop(April-ish). 
I do that through October. 
If I can I get my job back at AO, if not whatever. 
I go back to UMass but not really. Instead I do a domestic exchange at the California school I drooled over in high school, Humboldt State University. http://www.humboldt.edu/  In the middle of the Redwoods. 
I'm there for Spring 2006.
Get some experience on some Cali rivers.
If I can, stay for the fall semester.
After that? Who the hell knows. My guess.....I won't want to leave.

My Mom's totally for the idea because she wants to visit me. 

I'll admit I've had a lot of grand ideas that have flopped, but who doesn't? This one seems solid and perfect motivation to go to school. 

So yes I have taken the photography job. I understand that some may not feel that it's the best opportunity but I've looked at it from many angles and am sure this is one of the best things I can do with my time. 

I'm excited for all the possibilities. This week I'll be going to UMass. Talk to Goodell and see what they have to say. 

Tomorrow I go up to CAW and talk logisitcs with Frank and Jen about the upcoming season. Skiing at the Beast. Hanging out with Sare and UMassers.

Still on my gear wish list:
getting my sleeping bag soon....
tent: MHW Hammerhead 2
pack: Ariel 75
sunglasses: Native Ripp
sandals: 3 pairs from Teva and 1 more from Chaco
shoes: Vasque Velocity
more clothing....obvi!

and lots of camping this summer. I miss summer!!"

"event","So yesterday I spent the day with Sare, shopping for fabric, eating luch at Panera, going to Ware to sew. I didn't get much done, but I really didn't know what I was doing......watched tv, took 4:20 half shots of whiskey, more tv

Because I'm so lame (I suspect that my lameness was due to the sick feeling I'm having now....this feeling doesnot make winter any easier to swallow) I also wanted to get back to my house to watch ""Project Runway"" with my Mom, like we do every week. So I leave and get a message from Kaylin about a CAW gettogether, but wasn't up for that either. It was snowing and late (7:30PM) and had a drive back to Westfield. 

I needed gas and to hit up a bathroom. I stopped at some place and the guy pumps my gas and I get the key from the inside to unlock the bathroom around the corner. I don't know how the fuck it happened but the key breaks of in my hand. I have to pinch the little piece out of the lock in the bathroom door that I never got open, but desperately needed to. I felt so awful and embarrassed that I left with out even trying the other key they had. 

So my tank is filled but I still need a bathroom. I thought I could make it home. I get to the MassPike (I could have taken two ways home but I decided on the Mass Pike way) and I realize that I have a total of 2 dimes and about 10 pennies. I need 45 cents to get off the Pike. Whatever I get on and I figure I'll feel around for some change and get lucky. Halfway down the pike I have to pull into the service station. 

Mission #1 Run out of my car and go to the bathroom. Mission #2 on the way, look for loose change on the floor that will get me off the Pike. Bathroom - check. On my way out I glance at the tampon dispenser. There is an off chance that there might be some change laying around. Turns out!! A quarter in the machine but it's stuck. I have to pry the thing out with my key and that takes me a minute or so, like forever in that sort of context. If anyone walked in it would have been a sight. So Mission accomplished! 2 dimes + quater = 45 cents, exactly what I needed.

And I still made it home for Project Runway. 



The hits just keep on coming in my life.....never a dull moment. 


Heard something hilarious! 
very much paraphrased  ""So Viagra has a new thing, except instead of a pill, it's in an Inhaler form. It promises to produce an erection in 30 seconds.......Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't that be a blowjob?"" ~Jimmy Carr (very funny Englishman)


So I got a new cellphone and it's really way more than I wanted in terms of features but hey I might like the color display, handsfree, walkietalkie, voice activated doodads that came with it. I just pray I don't become ""THAT"" type of person......yuck!!

Tomorrow is Mt Washington with my Mom. Cold.....don't talk to me about cold after this weekend, don't even think about it. Plus I think I'm coming down with the ""sickness"". The last thing I want."

New York City to visit Daniela, which was tons of fun. Living in a city at some point in my life might be fun. I've got time.

CAW mailing stuff 3 days last week and one last day tomorrow. That's been fun. I can't get enough of those people. 

I perpetually discover FOR SOOOO MANY REASONS that I have a very warped sense of CAW relations. In my naive perspective I think that everyone is friends but no one sleeps together. In actuallity no one is friends but everyone sleeps with everyone else. 

Skiing up at Stratton on Thursday. I went hard from 10 to 4. No breaks, No stopping. And the weather was fucking tropical. It was a good day. 

I went to dinner with my Mom and like 16 of her co-workers. I spoke when I was spoken to and had the pleasure of hearing my Mom use the phrase ""fuck me boots"".

I went out today to look for jobs. I have an interview at....... (don't worry I'll shake my head enough for the both of us) .....Bath and Body Works. Hey it's a job and I've got a shopping problem, but probably not there....too much, that is. 

I think I'm going to pass on going to Myrtle Beach with Brennan. Not a final decision but hopefully I can use that week to start working <i>at my new job</i>....possibly.

Skiing up at Mt. Snow with CAW, it could be a possibility again. 

This weekend I'm going to Mt. Washington with Mom-Tard. We're snowshoeing/hiking and skiing. 

Next week the UMassers are coming back. My dropout status will be official."

...but I'm really pulling things together here. It took a week and a half but whatever.

I finally started on my skirt, it's fabulous rust colored fake suede, SO HOT!! I'll probably finish it up tomorrow.

This week (the past two days....shrug) I've made the gym a major priority. Monday I was there at 7am!! Woah. I set aside at least 2-2.5 hrs and I go pretty hard. It's nice. I keep a workout journal and I'm really paying attention to what I eat now. Since rafting ended I've slacked off alot. It was becoming noticable. Sigh, well it only gets better from here. 

New Year's Eve was good. Sare, Andy, Meagan and I took a couple walking cruises on the outskirts of NoHo, had rum spiked hot cocoa, and motherfucking huge pizza from Nene's. then saw John Brown's Body at Pearl Street. It was a good show and I spent most of the night drooling over the horn boys. This time I was acually coherent and could function. We didn't have any high school sightings. 

I ordered my sleeping bag>>  http://www.westernmountaineering.com/index.cfm?section=Products&page=Sleeping%20Bags&cat=Microfiber%20Series

and boots, Primo Chill Massifs in chocolate>>  http://www.merrellboot.com/catalog/gallery.asp?NavID=WBR
these are going to be so hot with my skirt.

Thursday I'm going to Okemo with Jay and Eric. It should be alot of ""Dude that girl was so hot"", lots of farting and talking about big black dildos.........they think it's hi-fucking-larious to get me to blush. This could be a huge mistake........I'm totally lying, I love those boys.

Working up at CAW three days next week, mailing stuff. That'll be fun too.

X-mas was good mostly money and that's fabulous.

My Aunt was up here for the week.

Had two family dinners. One Tuesday night and the other yesterday afternoon. The latter was at FitzWilly's In NoHo (Thanks Daniela!) Then shopping with my Mom and Aunt the two most polar opposite siblings since......my Brother and I, but moving on. My mom looking eclecticly mismatched, with an exception for her X-mas gift from me a Patagonia sweater (very nice!). My Aunt with her <b>Coach</b> loafers, <b>Gucci</b> purse, <b>$1200</b> bracelet on the right and <b>$2400</b> watch on the left wrist. Yea they're different. Then after shopping I picked up two DVDs of ""Sex and the City"". My Aunt and I indulged in a christmas tin of popcorn and 12 episodes. I skippied the gym, oh well.  

Drove her to the airport early this morning, but still much to do today. So I'd better get to it. 

Really looking forward to the show tomorrow!! 

On the horizon: 
January: Visiting Daniela
 
February: Mt. Snow with CAW
                and

I'll study for by Bio exam tonight, for tomorrow. Hopefully that will close that for the semester. 

This weekend I'll be finalizing the Beaver paper. It's crazy I wrote the most initially and I'm stuck fixing the most for the final copy. Whatever has to be done, will be by Sunday evening. 

I will also be working on my assignments due for Writing on Monday. 

After that I'll have 2 exams and my final edit of my big piece of writing. 

The X-mas party will truly be a celebration to end all celebrations. 

After that?? Well it will seem pretty similar to the way winter break would have been if I was going to school next semester. Hopefully I'll use those five weeks more effectively than I have in my two previous winter breaks(which were always painfully boring).

I will miss:
-reading the daily collegian in the dc
-living in this little UMass metropolis micro-cosom 
-learning....I just wish this semester inspired me
-having dinner plans with people I wouldn't see otherwise
-walking into Amherst to kill time
-the warm dorms
-being a college student


I'm not going to enjoy
-having to drive to get everywhere I want to get to....even though I still love to drive
-living at home
-the long drive to AO
-my cold house
-friends that are even farther away
-finding a new job
-having to tell people why I'm not going to school
-being a Westfield-townie


I'm just going to have to stick to my decision and deal with it."

"event","Recently I've found myself going home for the lack of better things to do/not wanting to be in my room. It's aggravating at best. I suppose the ""Great Baker Experiment"" <i>failed</i>. However I learned <i>something</i> from it. 

Saturday was action packed. Hiked with Daniela and got in some talk time that seemed to be overdue. Seven Sisters range in about 3 hours, not bad for two out of shape raft guides. Showered and then dinner with Daniela, Matt and Chris. Hockey Game after that. I realized that I might miss going to sporting events, but it was more just nostalgia from high school, college games just don't quite cut it. It was also a hard loss. We almost lost the night all together if it weren't for Marty. Grabbed some food and some 40s and went over there to drink. Enjoyed several hours of 3-Man and the Finger Game. I established that I rock at CAW drinking games. Crawled into bed sometime after 2am.

Today I fought to wake up early to get some beaver work done before our group meeting at 12pm. We all worked pretty hard on the paper and presentation for over 4 hours. It's nice most of us get along. It makes me feel like I almost enjoy doing the work and seeing it progress and improve. 

Tonight I'll be taking dinner solo, something that I cope with but I will not miss when I'm not coming back next semester. After that it's back to work trying to put together a coherent, concise 4 minute schpeel about the ins and outs of trapping beaver. 

Tomorrow marks the last full week of regular classes. I might be a little nervous looking at the semester closing and having all this time ""to do what I want"".........WHAT THE HELL DO I KNOW ABOUT <b>WHAT I WANT</b>"

"event","Well I guess I've decided. I'm not going back to school next semester. I had been waivering for the entire semester, so I've weighed the good and the bad. 

I realize that I'll probably regret it, but I don't think I could appreciate any more school with out doing with out for a little.....did that make any sense?

I am now fully aware, after this Thanksgiving break, how boring my house can be 1) without any motivation to contact any friends 2) when I'm not at work 3) when I dont have plans to do anything. 
So to survive this decision I have to establish a circle of friends (ok, I take for granted the friends I have because I don't call them.....honestly I figure they have better things to do than have the time to hang out with me, everyone's got someone else higher on their list)
I have to find another job. Substitute teaching? I've considered it, but I have no idea what it requires. 
Get a regular routine between trying to be social and working, to other things. Pick up a hobby or activity that I will enjoy.

So in the next couple of weeks I will finish up my four classes. There are 11 more days of classes and beyond that three exams and 2 big final papers. 

I'm seeing the need to travel while I'm taking the next couple of months off of school. I really don't have anyone to travel with, but I think I would enjoy being solo. That's most of my life as it is, why not. I want to go skiing a bunch, but I don't see new skis on the horizon....maybe next season. 

Other than that, there's a bunch of other things complicating my mind. 

I suppose that's all for now. 
Before the end of the night, I hope to have some pictures up on here....maybe"

Overdramatic, yes!

What she doesn't know will kill you
by Matt Brochu 

November 21, 2003 

You met her a few months ago, and somehow she managed to seep into your subconscious like that ""Suga how you get so fly"" song. Just like you have no clue who the hell sings it, you don't know why she's there. But she is, whether you like it or not. You know her cell phone, her room phone. You can dial her Aunt Doreen's house in West Springfield (where she goes to do her laundry every two weeks) faster than you can peck-out 911. But she doesn't know. 

Her screenname, that generic one with her first name followed by three to five random numbers or UMass, has its own category at the top of your buddy list. Not only do you know what a ""Buddy Alert"" is, you've rigged your computer to play ""Fat Guy in a Little Coat"" from ""Tommy Boy"" every time her screen name changes from gray to black. Then her away message comes down, and you have a decision to make. To IM or not to IM? These are the ridiculous games that you play on a daily basis. But she doesn't know.

She's it. All right, so maybe not ""it"" it. Not necessarily Ms. Right, but closer to Ms. Right-up-there-with-Anna-Kournikova-and-Lizzie-McGuire-on-your-list-of-people-you'd-give-anything-to-be-stranded-with-on-a-broken-down-elevator. But it's about more than that. When is it ever about more than that? Never. Not like frilly white dress, overpriced catering, embarrassing drunk in-laws more, but closer to UMass sweatpants, two D.P. Dough Roni Zonies, a futon and a movie you have no interest in seeing more. But she doesn't know.

She's gorgeous, but gorgeous is an understatement. More like you're startled every time you see her because you notice something new in a ""Where's Waldo"" sort of way. More like you can't stop writing third grade run-on sentences because you can't remotely begin to describe something ... someone ... so inherently amazing. But you're a writer. You can describe anything. That's what you do: pictures to words, events to words, words to even better words. But nothing seems right. More like you're afraid that if you stare at her for too long, you'll prove your parents right: that yes, your face will stick that way. But you wouldn't mind. 

You wouldn't mind that the questioning, ""Hello?"" on the other end makes you want to smile and throw up at the same time. You wouldn't mind worrying about what to get her for her birthday and spending $300 when you only have $17.50 and a Triple-A card to your name. You wouldn't mind that she left your TV on and the blaring infomercials wake you up at 4 a.m. ... because it gives you a chance to watch her sleep. You don't mind that you've slipped up twice when you were hammered and hinted at how you feel, but she was too drunk to remember. So she doesn't know.

Sure, she's pretty, but it's about more than that. You two connect. Anything you throw at her, she can throw right back. You figured out what's going on in that predictable head of hers in under five minutes, but something tells you her heart would take about five years. 

You remember everything she's ever said to you, and when that freaks her out you blame it on your photographic memory (which is a lie, you have a 2.7 GPA). You can't remember your teaching assistant's name, and you can't remember that your Puffton rent check was due four days ago, yet you remember the middle name of the kid who tripped her in fifth grade and gave her that cute little scar on her shoulder. Maybe it's because you actually listen when she talks. When do you actually listen? Never. But she doesn't know.

But she has a boyfriend. The kid is a tool, and you are not. He has no redeeming qualities, and you have about 38, even when you're hung over. You could kick his butt, and you've never been in a fight in your life. He treats her like crap, and you would treat her like the princess she believed herself to be on Halloween in 1988. 

But she loves him. He wouldn't know what he had even if she slapped him across the face and dumped him, but somehow she still loves him. And somehow she still doesn't know.

Then, out of nowhere, she slaps him across the face and dumps him. She comes to you. You've been there before, so you seem like the smartest guy on earth.

You go to sleep. You wake up. She doesn't know. You're not in love. You're not obsessed. You blame it on the fact that you just need to get some, but still, it's about more than that. It would just be nice if once in your life, things worked out the way you wanted them to.

The past two weeks have been crazy. It kicked off with 3 exams in row that I knew nothing about. So far I know the results to 2 of them, fish I did 2 points worse on than the first exam, no big and human dimesions I did 8 points better, major score!! Bio, eh fuck it I probably sucked hardcore on that one. I'm not worried. So yea I pulled one out of my ass it seems. 

I've also been working like a dog, in the past pay period> Nov 1st-Nov 15th. I worked like 58.75hrs. Yikes, that's like alomst full time, adult like and stuff. I thought it was because I am really greedy and materialistic and wanted to get all that cool gear, but it turns out that a lot of that will be going to my overdrawn account. A CAW check for a lot of money, that was 2 1/2 months old didn't clear and screwed me over with out me knowing about it. So I've been like $100 in the hole for the past week, and my spending has been cut off. I should have it resolved tomorrow.

""The following is how Merriam Webster defines the word ""sport""- an activity engaged in for pleasure (although evolutionarily functional, sex is usually engaged in for kicks) involving physical exertion (which is why most guys sweat during it) and skill (the clitoris is like a damn rubix cube), usually involving balls (no need for clarification here), that is governed by a set of rules or customs (which explains why I always feel obligated to cuddle afterwards). So, if you don't count the next-day-awkwardness, those pesky discharges, or the possibility of illegitimate children, then the definitions of sex and sport are pretty much one and the same.""

Yup it's that time of the semester, where I start counting days till the end. Days left of class, number of days total including weekends....it's all a numbers game in my head. 

Thursday was fun, Christin and I drove out to Framingham to pick up some REI stuff she ordered and nothing made us two gear-heads happier than wandering around and checking out all the cool stuff. Panera Bread after that.

Friday I worked and then went home. I brought home a little surprise for my parents....A DOG! Yea it's Kerry's from AO and she needed to find a home. So I thought my parents might go for it. Oh well they didn't but it was nice to have her for a night. 

Saturday and Sunday were very similar. Lots of AO and Beavers. Sunday night had dinner with Kaylin and Bob at the Hanger.

Well last week ended and I didn't die....not even close. I was still able to sleep a full night's sleep every night. But I have to say when I was up, I was bouncing from one thing to another. Had clinics and regular work, homework, exam studying, paper writing....yada, yada, yada. 

Thursday went to the Hanger with Kaylin, Sarah and Dave for some food. They left me to go to the bars with almost everyone else I know. Another one bit the dust, when Kaylin turned 21 last week. That doesn't leave many friends still underage. What if I promise I won't drink if they let me in the bar?? Oh well.

Friday I volunteered to work b/c I feel the need for lots of money. I want so many things and that's the only way. I decided that I want to invest in:
-a nice!! two(possibly even three) person tent, I'm thinking Mountain Hardware's Hammerhead
-a big pack from Osprey, like 60 liters, an Ariel
-a 3 season sleeping bag, down preferably, Western Mountaineering ideally
-a real sturdy pair of boots, scarpa SL-M3!! 
-a good pair of ski pants
-a pair of Tubbs Elevation snowshoes
There's a longer list somewhere I wrote down when I bored and daydreaming in class, but those are the biggies. I might as well.

I got out of work lickity-slit to make it to NoHo for a 9:20 showing of ""I Heart Huckabees"" with some CAW girls, Christin, Sarah, and Jen. It was a fantastic movie. I'm  glad we went to see that over Motorcycle Diaries. What a surprise, they went to the bars, but I had to sleep so it was ok.

Worked again on saturday 9-5. Dinner with Christin, then home to regroup, use the internet, get research materials for beaver paper.

Didn't do much till I got back to school sunday evening. Had dinner with Christin again and researched my paper. Viva La Bam capped off the night. 

Busy as all hell day yesterday. 3 classes then grabbed some grab and go and went to work 1-9. Yikes that's a full day. But I pulled it off and then a little studying before sleeping.

went to Mary's first. I wasn't planning on staying but wanted to say Hi, drop off a Rap mix I made for her and such. Rob and Fisher were there and Amy was planning on showing up later. I didn't get to see her. I left because I thought I might have been late for Dave's since I was showing up 2 hours late. BIG NOPE! I anxiously waited for a while, while more people lazily dragged their asses over. It was nice when everyone actually showed up Frank, Sarah, Jen, Daniela, Matt, Kaylin, Bob, Ryan. Played the finger game with jello shots and that was Ryan's demise. The rest of the night we found various places around the house for him to pass out at (on top of cardboard boxes, in hot tubs, ...)

Spent the morning getting attacked my Cadi, cleaning up hardened jello shots and taking down decorations. Had breakfast with Ryan and said our good-byes. 

This week it'll be an exam trifecta; fish monday, human dimensions tuesday, biology wednesday. From now till wednesday afternoon, I might be just a tad stressed. So I'd better stop procrastinating and crack open the books that have a month's worth of dust on them (not kidding)."

Baseball game watching with Ryan Tuesday. Skipped a full day of classes wednesday to stay in bed, shop at Sal's for his halloween costume, lunch and going for a hike. Productive and and then completely not. 

Thursday back up to Heath because I forgot my glasses, took the afternoon to track them down.  

Friday I went to the hospital with my Mom to visit my Dad. He's been there since Tuesday for a knee replacement. Then dinner with Mom-Tard. 
My brother broke his ankle, but can't use crutches because he broke his wrist a couple weeks ago. So he's got a walker!!! My Dad's not even using his walker for his knee.....is that irony? ::trying to remember the lyrics to that song:: (just kidding)

Yea I had a lot of fun.

Friday: I went to the gym, because I've been trying to get back into that. Then went to the Hanger to meet up with the Crabbies. Like the Hanger, on a friday night, an hour before the Sox's game was a good idea especially when we always bring an army of people. So we decided to order not just one but two zeppelins and some fries and head to Tuba's house. Christin and I waited for the food, which took a while but it was all worth it because it was free. They thought we paid, but the money was still in my pocket when we walked out of there with $111.09 worth of food....Score!! We were saintly by not splitting the money between us.  We were allstars and went back to Tuba's. Lots of drinking and eating. Watched Boondock Saints and drank everytime someone said ""Fuck""......Fuck, that was a bad idea. At the end of the night it was just Ryan and myself and we spent the night there. 

Saturday: Went back to school, then home to get ready for going camping. we decided on the Dunbar Brook Trail. They have lean-tos(not sure how the hell you spell that)...so we didn't have to worry about tent camping. I wanted to take him to the overlook I found a couple weeks ago. I got to Ryan's and I actually met the guy that owns the $800,000 house Ryan watches. A little awkward because I think he knew I have been there more than a couple of times, the dogs knew me and he noticed. We hiked in for about 45 minutes. The first pick campsite next to the brook wasn't available because boy scouts were using it, we picked the other option far from the boy scouts. We gathered firewood and started a fire. I got my foot stuck in the mud and he made reference to ""The Princess Bride"". I told him I have problems with that movie and movies like it. I wouldn't see it out of moral principle. It rained heavily for most of the night, but we were dry. I was still very cold though, teeth chattering and everything. 

Sunday: The next morning we packed up and went for a hike from the campsite. It took us about an hour to get to the overlook. Some people were there when we got there, but they left pretty quickly so that was good. It's really beautiful up there. We took our time getting back....actually we took our time getting everywhere. It was nice for neither of us to have anything to really get back for. For me it ws my first full weekend off sinc April and he didn't even have the full weekend off because he worked two jobs on friday. Once we were back to the car, we realized how hungry we were. Neither of us brought much food. I had five grapefruits in my car from shopping a couple days before and he brought some soup that was warm a couple hours into the trip, along with some red wine. We ate eggplant lasagna and watched the Pats game back at the house. While I was flipping around the channels I found, what do ya know, ""The Princess Bride"" on tv. He forced me to watch it. It was ok, whatever so now I can say I've seen it. Went to bed. 

Monday: He had to be up at 3:37am to get to work and I couldn't get back to sleep after that so I headed back to UMass shortly after that. Went to class, napped, errands to develop some pictures from West Virginia up to this past weekend, AO stuff. Had dinner with Chris, Melissa and Mike. I really do miss the regular dinners every night. I guess times have changed. 

That just about sums it up.

I've seriously reconsidered just staying at UMass next semester. Everyone hates school, why not me too. NOOO, that's not the way I want to look at it, but I should just prove myself wrong and tough it out. I can handle it. Plus I don't think I could give up CAW for some other option next year. And NOLS isn't financially a good idea, not yet at least. 

I realize and keep realizing that the Ryan thing is so temporary it doesn't deserve any serious consideration. Just semi-day-to-day planning. That's all. I've known that, don't get me wrong, but sometimes my mind wanders. 

I need to get back into a rhythm. That is the only way I will tolerate the rest of this semester and survive the next one. A routine that includes mostly daily gym visits and learning to re-love the library. It seems I escape to my room when I need escaping, which is different than last year. I just don't love my classes, or maybe I didn't last year but somehow it worked. 

Lately I've been so addicted to Bush....the band. Why? No fucking clue, except the music is fucking hot(literally).

Dave's B-day party at the Hanger. It's the off season and my first full weekend off since APRIL!! but I still can't enough of these people.

"event","I had a whole entry typed up about the odds and ends of the past weekend, but I lost it. But after reading Daniela's entry I feel the need to make my entry just as sappy. 

End of the year party:
It's so hard to see another season come to a close. It's a tight-knit group of people that depend on each other on the river and more importantly off. Everyone there is like a brother or a sister and Frank and Jen being our surrogate parents. When it's good, it's excellent and when you hit a low point, you suck it up because you know the good far outweighs any bad(and because you're a fucking river guide!!). Because a bad day of work at CAW is better than a good day anywhere else. 

If we had a CAW yearbook, this is what I'd write in yours:
To Daniela: It was over a year ago you came up with this crazy idea of becoming a river guide. The whole thing made me nervous for you, it's of course not easy and you learned that like anyone else. I'm glad you were able to be a part of this family, you certainly proved yourself. 

To Matt: I think we both know you're like a brother to me. The sibling rivalry and physical violence are evidence to that. You will always be an important person to me, on and off the river.

To Mary: I always admired you. Your skills as a guide, a hard worker and just to call you a friend. We'll always have our ghetto music in the kitchen.

To Zerah: My road trip partner, we've had two fantastic years. You've been a good friend to have around. I like that you're not afraid to call me out on the stupid shit I do.

To Christin: We've become really good friends and I love you for that. I think I could tell you a lot that I wouldn't tell other people. I've enjoyed getting lost in the woods and the many trips to Bueno.

To Putnam: My rookie-class-partner-in-crime! We've spent two years with CAW and we may end up going our separate ways or just maybe end up somewhere new together. Who knows, but you'll always be one of my favorites.
 
To Bob: Can I tell you how much I'm going to miss you? We are assholes to each other and I love it. 

To Marty: Wow, to anyone else it would seem like we hated each other, but I know that wasn't the case. You know it too. I love your ghetto style and I will miss bossing you around in the kitchen. Marty you're awesome.

To Sarah: I don't think I laugh as much around anyone else. It was great spending the summer with you and your crazy antics. You're someone I really need to call upmore often.

To Kaylin: I realized too late in the season that we didn't hang out as much as we should have. We'll do more of that in the off-season. You're a great person to talk to and hopefully I've been a good listener for you. 

To Rob: Again you're a great person that I didn't take enough time to get to know really well. I think I was acting like too big of an ass most of the time to really be nice, but you know none of it was in mean spirits. 

To Dave: I'm glad that between last year and this past year you became more of a friend than just a boss. I hope you will stay with CAW for a couple days a week, but moreso follow your passions even if they're not on the Deerfield.

To Ryan: Why did it take so long for any of this to happen? Well I'm so grateful we've had the past couple of weeks. I really enjoy your company. Good luck with going out west, it's going to be hard to see you leave, but maybe I'll have someone to visit if I ever get out to Oregon.

To Frank and Jen: I could gripe about the little things but now they mean nothing. I love the company you run, the employees you hire and the atmosphere you've created. We all work hard for you and you work hard for us. CAW will always be more than a job, it's an institution. We all learned different things about ourselves."

Saturday was good. A not so great run through the Gap, but my crew was nice. I went to dinner with Christin at the People's Pint in Greenfield. We talked about the usual... boys and such. There were a lot of things I could have done with my night, but only one thing I really wanted to do. So I took the intiative and went over Ryan's. At this stage of whatever it is I'm feeling so much more comfortable around him. This is probably only apparent privately, but that's enough for me. He said I would hate him in 24hrs for not getting enough sleep, but I didn't mind. 

Sunday was my last day of rafting and I wanted it to be good. It was pretty decent, not the best display of guiding I've ever ever had, but a good note to go out on. The best was the rowdy bunch of boy scouts we took down. I got so beaten and bruised from wrestling with other customers I'm surprised no one got hurt. Waterfighting was terrifying. For awhile I didn't know if we were all going to make it out of there alive.
I had my two dads holding my legs while a mother in another boat tried to get me in the water. Probably because I stole Sarah's paddle, her guide. My little boys were so much fun too. It was a great day.

We left the base at 5pm and Frank thought we'd be pushing it to make it there on time. We got food, air in the tires, oil and headed south. Jen drove first, Sarah drove second, me third and Kaylin forth. I kept myself awake by slapping my own ass. Hey, whatever works. We decided our mission was eating and driving and maybe we'll have some time to squeeze in a little rafting. On the forth shift from 3-6:30am Kaylin rove and I was her co-pilot, we kept ourselves going by our horrible singing and my bluebird hand motions and of course more ass slapping. We got to Rivers after getting awful directions from this Sherry character. But I made up for it because I pissed on her lawn and got a ""Beer City"" bumper sticker from her. Ate atery-clogging death defying biscuits from Biscuit World. We sat around the parking lot for awhile because we assumed they wouldn't be starting toooo early, not before 6:45. Guess again. We rushed to get changed and watched a video saftey lecture, self-served our gear and got on the bus. We met our guide Billy at the put-in. 

The water was like brown bath water. Super super warm. We had a 14' boat with 4 of us and a guide. We were eased into the first couple of rapids and then we came to the first class 5(there were 5 of them). The first called ""Insignificant"", the boat in front of us dumped 3 people out and we came through and I went out. I didn't get far from the raft but couldn't get back in because I wouldn't let go of my paddle and my hand was stuck underneath the boat. It was awesome though. 

We must have made like every surf. The most intense one ""Hungry Mother"" flipped the little boat that went down before us and we were told to high-side if we needed to. Jen got ripped out and I dove to the low-side to get her back. It was awesome, maybe not for her. Our guide smoked a couple cigarrettes along the way and Jen needed one after that surf. 

The weather was perfect, sunny, warm. We couldn't have asked for more. Other big rapids Pillow Rock, Iron Ring, Sweet's Falls, Lost Paddle. All class 5, all excellent. We tried to postage stamp on a rock, we didn't, but some did. 

Lunch was better than Frank said it was going to be. For that matter Frank was wrong about most of the things he said. We all thought we were going to die, because he told us we would. I kept analyzing the lunch, wow that's scary.

We jumped off a 20ft cliff and I got a chance to guide a pretty straight forward class 3 rapid. Just big waves. But I can't guide like they do. They call numbers ""Forward 2"", ""Forward 1"", ""left side forward 1"", yea it's ""All Ahead"" for my crew and they don't stop. 

We were promised a flip. I knew it was coming, so did Putnam. The ""Fuzzy Box of Kittens"" rapid. He used the diagonal wave and he nearly dump trucked us all except for himself and Kaylin. Other people used the rapid to flash the videographer. ""HEEEY WHHHOORE!!""

We got on the bus for a 40 minute ride back. Jen and I polished off 3 beers before we got off, FUCKING NICE!!! Back at the base, we showered and shopped at the gift shop. I passed out on my trunk for awhile. It was so funny, everyone(customers, staff, guides) they all knew we were those Massachusetts raft guides. They said it was ""written all over us"". It could have been my car that was smack dab in the middle of the parking lot with drying clothes draped all over it or the gear stickers or Mass plates or just the fact that we are sexy bitches.......What??!!?. 

We were famous during the slide show(well miss slutty, take off her lifejacket and flash the camera was just slightly more popular). People we saved bought us beers(my total was like 5 in 2.5 hrs on very little sleep and food at 3 in the afternoon....fantastic). 

I bought the DVD and photo CD of all of our trip. You can all see the carnage later. Our guide suggested 25 cent wings at Class IV rafting. Kaylin slept and Sarah, Putnam and I got food. 

Some guys we met invited us to sleep in some spare beds they had in their cabin. Hey better than outside!! I passed out around 8 and the others stayed up a little later than me. 

Woke up at 8am and packed up. Went to breakfast with the guys. A place Frank actually suggested ""The Cathedral Cafe"" It was really really good. From there at 11am, we drove home.

Kaylin bought the most awesome book. She read quotes from it that made me cry. All I can say is that I love the whole river culture. I know I'm not alone. It seems to just get into your soul your blood and its incurable. 

We busted out the camera for the drive back and took some choice shots. We talked alot about sex and relationships(specific and non-specific). 

It was a trip that none of us will forget. There will be others, with other people, to different places somewhere in our futures, but we'll remember the first.

There's more I'm sure and you know I'd take any amount of time to sit down and brag about it in person. Just ask.

WOW

and now it's only 2 days left till the weekend.
1 test tomorrow and 3 classes to get through on friday. 

AO both days this weekend and the end of the year party on sunday. That should be legendary, and I only use that term when I mean it and can make it happen."

I suppose I've been bitching lately about one thing or another. Not out loud, but in my head sometimes I get hung up on the negative. And then for some reason on my drive to AO from CrabApple(b/c I worked both jobs today, the fun never stops), I was just really satisfied. For any particular reason? No, it's not like I'm really getting.....any.....thing I want. ::rolls my eyes:: But for some reason I'm over it. 

<u>Great lyrics</u>
""And you know why they made the new twenties
Cause I got all my old ones
That's why"" ~~Jadakiss ""Why""

<u>Correction Dana, this is STILL the song of the school year:</u>
""I beep my horn and they come to the car
Damn right, they come to a stall
That's right, it come with the car
Now tell your boss, you cant come in tomorr
My dro come by the jar
They bring me drinks, why come by the bar?
Nah nigga I ain't come here to spar
These hallow tips will come where you are
I stomp through smooth with the soldiers
Two steppin and movin my shoulders
Now the money's rollin in
We got bottles lined up like bowlin pins
Mami, you standin with a slouch
Starin at me, while I'm standin on the couch
Come and get in the blue flames
Have a sip of this blue shit and lets rock!

[Chorus]
<b>Now you know I don't usually do this
But you lookin good tonight
And you know I don't usually do this
But you gon smoke tonight
And you know I don't usually do this
But you gon drink tonight
And you know I don't usually do this
But you gon fuck tonight</b>

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Now.. Who's hot? Who's not?
I can take the few shots you've got
I can burn a few knots you've got
I can blow the few spots you've got
But, I chill, I will
Get it to poppin whenever I feel
I still shut it down
And I white and yellow stud it down
Watch them pretty girls strut it 'round
Take the birdies and putt it down
Like Tiger Woods did it, but I'm hood with it
You've never seen a thug look as good with it
And I promise that
Fuck with me, you better move where 'sama's at
You see I'm in here with the white ones on
<b>Tryin to get fucked up 'for the lights come on (let's go)</b>

Practiced rolling tuesday. Then went hiking, which od course ended with Christin and myself getting lost. We stopped by the Granville Gorge. Later on that night we went to see Farenheit 911. Ehh, does it change my overall opinion? No. But I did learn <i>something</i>. 

Wednesday night after rafting we went hardcore with the Dodgeball practice. I suck but it was fun. Then dinner with the guys. 

Thursday was more rafting. 

Friday I paddled the Bridge section.

Saturday I worked AO then riverfest craziness began. Drove up with Sarah and Putnam. Ate food, drank a bunch (got to use my flask!!), smoked a little. A notorious Crabapple employee was seen having sex in the parking lot with some chick. Oh Boy! Tug of War w/ Zoar was awesome! Crabapple rocked so hard, plus we don't cheat. No dodgeball, because they're pussies. Tried to get into the Park(a bar), but went to Pattie's instead. Then a little swimming(more like an hour) sans clothing w/ Sarah and Putnam. Who'da thought? Tried to drive home, Sarah finished it off. <woah! Crashed at Frank and Jen's at like 4:30 in the morning. Woke up to leave for Adventure Outfitters at 9am. No keys in the house, couldn't find them in the car (which was trashed). I had a spare set of car keys but I needed my keys to open the store. Putnam and I couldn't remember who drove to the house last night. We needed Sarah to figure out where the keys might be, she left the house at 7:30 to go to the base. Call the base and find out she's on dam crew(the circumstances suck). We think she has the keys and first try to find them at the base and then change plans to double back to drive to the dam to ask Sarah. We get halfway there and Putnam turns to me ""Steph what do your keys look like?"" Yea Putnam just realized she put them in her bag that was in my trunk. Woah!! After all this driving up and down Rt. 2 we hauled ass to Hadley because I had to open the store. I got there at 10:20, 35 minutes late. Kevin didn't care, so it was ok. But I hate being late. I guess I should try harded to remember the end of the night...lol. 

Went to practice my roll again, which is now very solid!! Then took a drive to Chapel Brook in Ashfield and walked down the waterfall. 

Most of this past week I documented with my new digital camera. I still have to figure out how to get them up on LJ. Soon enough. 

I'm rafting tomorrow(hope for lots of water!! or just more than 700). Wenesday is my last day off till Sept 7th. Woah. Wednesday I'm going to the ocean to kayak. That's a fact. 

Next week I find out about housing, yikes(In a good way)."

I've been slightly bummed from this past week. While it should have been good times, work issues(with both jobs) and aggravations got in the way. I've got 5 straight days of Fife-o-Rama's(big +20 boat trips) ahead of me and I look forward to it. Hopefully my first day back in a week and a half will be good and people won't make too many references to ""the incident"". I miss that group of people when I don't see them on a regular basis. I miss some people more than others. ::sigh:: In any event I'm enjoying summer, but I won't dread September toooo much. I miss going to parties and just getting into trouble. There will be much of that this year. 

on another note: Today was really good. I went out with my Dad and practiced my kayak roll for the second time and just when I was about to give in for the day, I got it!! It'll take a couple more times out to feel comfortable and feel that it's reliable, but it's such a good start. I hope to get out some night after work and practice at Puffer's.

I wrote my Letter of Apology to Crab Apple 
<lj-cut>Chuck, Sharyn, Jenn, Frank, Rob and the rest of the Crab Apple Staff and Family:

This email is first and foremost an apology for the incident on Saturday, July 10th, 2004. I am sorry for my actions that initially offended our guests and later embarrassed and compromised Crab Apple as a family-oriented business. 

I don't feel I could rationalize or justify my actions because at the heart of the matter I realize I had a lapse in judgment. I should have never taken the conversation to that extreme. While I disagree with the events as they were presented, I should have known that the requests of some people in Daniela's boat to hear the joke, did not represent everyone's; someone might get offended. With this incident behind me I will have a more delicate presence around mature guests. I will present an appropriate and considerate manner with any group from here on out. I will make discretion a top concern with all groups.

There is little I can do now that this has happened but learn from it. Without question I accepted my suspension will return to work when I'm needed as an improved guide. I will assume that even some of my coworkers will be able to learn from this incident. 

To the concerned Crab Apple staff in Maine, I feel embarrassed that you have to hear such negative feedback about a guide you do not know very well. I understand your impression of me must be tarnished but hopefully not ruined, and with however much time I have with Crab Apple there won't be any other damaging incidents.  

To Frank and Jenn, this incident may be even worse when considering how closely I work with both of you; over the past year and a half you have taken a chance by employing me as a guide. To take your guests down, to show them safety and service and to represent Crab Apple Whitewater. In turn, I have poured my heart and soul into this job. That is why I have taken this mistake so hard. When I come back I hope I can regain your confidence. 

I feel I could pour over this apology for more paragraphs, but will instead keep it at this. I hope my message has come across as I wanted it to. 

If the incident, my response or any further comments need to be made please do not hesitate to call my home (413-568-3304) or reply by email. 

Sincerely, 
Stephanie Stevens<lj-cut>

Overall this summer's been awesome, as I knew(hoped) it was going to be. You just can't beat a life chock full of rafting, partying and little/no responsibilities.
I wish I could recap all the little events of the past couple weeks, but I suppose they wouldn't come across as funny. 

It's exactly(...almost) what I wanted since summer ended last year. Life is just so simple. It scares me to think of September and school. I just want to be stuck in summer. 

Ok I'm done with that......I suppose I just appreciate these months and experiences so much it's hard to think that summer will only go on for a couple more weeks. 

In any case, I am enjoying my summer so far and, from catching up on my semi-weekly lj reading, it seems everyone else is enjoying theirs. I'll look forward to getting back to school when that time rolls around. Along with that I'll be looking forward to everything that comes with it. 







Something's been weighing on my mind......I thought it wasn't a concern anymore, I thought I was over it....nope. I guess not. I suppose I'm just going to go for it. What is it worth to just sit on it and let it bother me? I might keep *you* posted (depending on who *you* happens to be)


I make some things so complicated. It hurts my head and parts of my heart to think that I can't do this....for myself. I'm so selfish otherwise, why not now?

The girls today were fabulous,  had a textbook day on the river, a bunch of hugs and $20 later I was happy (I did manage to lose the tip, but oh well). After work I went through 4 or 5 or 6 beers then went the movies to see Dodgeball with CAW people. No luck, it was sold out. We'll try to go next wednesday.

"event","This classic line summarized at least part of yesterday. The craziest day I've ever had on the river. Low low low water forced us to alter the trip, so that it started at Zoar Gap. This was after a morning of running boats and cars around, and all the while trying to keep the customers calm. The Gap, with 8 boats we had two pins and one dumptruck. Neither were mine but I was close. At the end of the run I still didn't know the names of the people in my boat. Zoar Gap was the only rapid we ran and then switched the trip to a funyak trip. While I've skipped many, many, funny, scary, insane details I'll skip to the best part. In the maddness of the day we were leaving boats all over the river. Five of us went back to get them back and on the trailer; 4 at the put-in, 3 below the Gap, and 5 more below the lunch site. Well there WERE 5!! We found only 4. On the drive down the road we spotted it on the river. Jumped out of the van and ran/bushwhacked through the woods to the river. 12-15 drunk underaged girls/creepy guys were in tubes and in our raft!!! We took the raft back and tried to keep Tuba from beating their white trash asses. Finally we made it back to the base to finish the clean up and then got bitched at by Frank and Jen for having a shitty day on shitty low water. BUT no ""Thank You"" for saving their $3500 raft. 

So that was yesterday

The rest of the summer since school's been out has been fabulous. I've worked everyday since, between AO and CAW.  The first weekend was rafting and a white trash bash with CAW folk. We resurrected ""spin-the-bottle"", F+J through a party the next sunday, went on a awesome day up to Monadnock with Mom-Tard, Mary threw a party, got in a legendary 5 minute surf with some high water on Fife(kept the majority of people in my boat)....I know there's more...

Went to Maine this past weekend. Drunk all three nights, camping, brochure run with Zerah, got into a bar, rafted the Kennebec gorge twice, fell out in Goodbye Hole, flipping boats and partying with Maine guides. 

So that's been the past couple weeks. I don't have time for much, but I'm enjoying myself never the less. I love being busy and the jobs that I have. 

Daniela's at the house and that's a good time, but it doesn't seem that either of us have time for just lounging around. 

There's so much planned for the rest of the summer, it seems like it's going to fly by. 

I've got to clean the kitchen with Mary tomorrow and then it's a party at Rob's house. 

I'll try to keep in touch better than I have been, but in case I don't get to wish you all well I'll do it here. I hope you're all having a good time. Feel free to give me a call and we can catch up."

"event","I'm just about the happiest girl in the world!!
I just got an email about my final english paper, which to my surprise turns out to be optional. Kickass!! So like hell I'm doing that. 

And I had my last exam....so by my calculations I'm done. Done for 3 months. 

From here on out it's going to be a stress free(hopefully) life of rafting, drinking and working at the shop. It's not complicated.  

My objectives for the next 3 months:
Have fun; something I've just recently been learning how to do....at least re-learning.
Make lots of money; working almost every day should achieve that. 

I look forward to the possibilities of the summer. 





To switch gears....in retrospect:
I regret many things about this year and this semester. I regret that I let many things get the best of me as a person and forced me to a place that I wasn't happy. In Steph-fashion I'm being vague and fuck it, who cares.... I wouldn't be truthful if I said any of it was caused by a single person, single suite, single incident. It was a semester's worth of circumstances. Circumstances guided by priorities(mine in relation to others). 

Bottom line: I don't care to carry any of this baggage any farther. I've been working to lose it for weeks now. I believe I've been pretty successful. I surround myself with people that want the same thing I do, to have a good time. Take it or leave it, it won't bother me any to go it alone. So as this semester has reached its close, I am closing the books on all the shit that has brought me down(much of it under my own control and my mistakes). 

I'm intent on not allowing this summer to be anything like this semester. 

Join me or find your happiness somewhere else."

"event","""I got a man""
""How long you had that problem?""
~Positive K

That says it all....except for the fact that I don't, but I'm not stressing over it. 

I felt inspired to make a note of some of my thoughts while they're still kind of forming in my head.

Why would I want a relationship? because everyone else does?...that's not me. 
It's not my style to have obligations to a single person. I can barely hold down long-term friendships. 

Why? to validate myself as a person? am I not a complete person without some to call a boyfriend? 
Just had this conversation with Cupcake:
Me-""Next year it's going to be all couples.""
Him-""Well maybe you'll be in a relationship too.""
Aww, wouldn't that be fucking cute. Well I'm not waiting around to find out. 

While I can respect people in relationships and understand some people are more inclined to want that or need that in their lives, I'd rather not.....

...at least at this point. I'll leave the possibility open to anything happening, but as far into the future as I can see, it's not looking like anytime soon. 

Will I meet <i>that</i> person? sure. At a frat party? not likely, but that seems to be the place I go searching. In the mean time it's entertaining and when I grow up my opinions will change. 






oh snap!"

"event","quite the weekend I'd say:

Friday went to SigEp w/ Dana and her friends. Met some people there....yada, yada, yada. So yea that happened. Funniest part of that night> ""Why are your blankets and pillow off your bed?"" ""Ummm, yea not really sure.... ;-)""

Saturday rafted and whatnot. As 508 suite rules require, I bought donuts for the suite. You're welcome! I made it to bed by 11, for another day of rafting.

Sunday CAW again. Not the most perfect day, but it was the first day to get a tip. Had a Crabapple dinner w/ Mary and Marty. Surprisingly Marty is probably more ghetto than me. I love it!! I was beat by the end of it. 

Now I've got to concentrate on school work....at least until thursday night. That's when I'm going to get really really stupid and try to forget everything I've learned(except Chemistry and Stats, I still have exams for those)

I won't be rafting this weekend ::frown:: I'll be at AO, everyone should come and visit!! 

In 8 days it'll all be over!! I seriously can't wait.

btw, I can't get him out of my head.....something NEEDS to be done about this ::devious grin::"

"event","Well the craziness started Thursday. Classes then straight to Vermont. Worked up in the Brattleboro store 1-9 and closed all by myself. It was relaxing to chill around another shop and the customers were so much more mellow(exactly half of the people that came in had dreads). Then back in Amherst and went for a walk with Dana and ended up at Mary's. Of course talked all about rafting and whatnot. 

Friday was much like Thursday; classes, then straight to work for another 8 hours, only in Hadley this time. Then got ready to go to the Bowl Dance. Rookie Bob came too and we pregamed at Mary's with her friends. Met some interesting/sketchy people out in the bowl. Then more beers and then drove into town for some fresh, fresh pizza at Pinocchio's. I didn't have rafting the next day but Mary and Bob did, What troopers! ::thumbs up::

Saturday, wouldn't you know it was alot like Thursday AND Friday. Worked AO for another 8 hours and then chilled at Mary's for a couple hours with Bob and Dana. 

Sunday worked AO 10-6 and then to the Spring Concert w/ Dana. Busta Rhymes was, as always, excellent. Some didn't like it, but I had a good time. 

by the way has anyone noticed a trend to the past couple of days...working AO, hanging out at Mary's, with Dana and sometimes Bob, and not stop talk about rafting(that was implied by all the CAW gatherings)...yea I did too :) 

I wish I had been rafting this past weekend. Is this what the whole summer's going to be like? Me just regretting the time I'm not there. What can I do? Quit AO? Who isn't qutting AO, that's the question(answer: everyone is) No I couldn't do that. 
Oh well, I guess I'll just have to enjoy the time that I do get, which will still be 3-6 days a week. And of course there is always MAINE to look forward to!! I can't wait!! 

Oh yea and I'm not 21... that makes me mad! 

Today I went to the gym for the first time in too long(the past couple weeks sickness and laziness have won out). It felt good to pick up my old routine but it did wear me out. I'm gonna try to get there as much as possible in the next couples weeks. 

Along with managing time to work out, I have to get all the work I need to do done. To do list: Chem lab, Spacial Tech presentation, Lit. reading, 20pg history paper research and writing....and studying for exams 
On that dreary note, I'll stop procratinating(although an update was necessary) and get to some of that work I was just babbling on about. 

p.s. I don't like computer viruses

TWO WEEKS AND A DAY TILL MY BRAIN SHUTS DOWN FOR THE SUMMER!! WOOHOO"

"event","It was just one thing after another!

Friday night: I made the bold move to see Erwin and make plans for later that night. Sare, I think I'm finally starting to ""grow some balls"". He came up to the suite and was bombarded by all of my wonderfully adorable jackass friends. All of them felt the need to casually hang out in the hallway, thanks guys!! It was good we had somewhere else to go. It was a nice time, but I'm afraid I might have been throwing out mixed signals. I didn't mean to. We might have plans for this Thursday, who knows...

Saturday: Drove up to THE WEST w/ Daniela and Cupcake. And I did actually get to go rafting!! YAY for that. A good solid day on the river and then cleaned. Went back to the put-in to get the boats down the 1000 ft dam. And as Crabapple guides work doesn't get done unless you've got one hand free for a beer. That made the work, that much more fun :D Went to Frank and Jen's condo across from Mt. Snow and drank and ate. Attempted to go to bed at 11, but those Maine guides were quite persuasive. Risk Management advice from FBI Tim: don't go into a sauna w/ 3 drunk, barely dressed Maine raft guys.....oh well, it's not like anything actually happened. Almost got caught smoking by Jen, yikes! Finally went to bed at 2am

Sunday: Up for another day of fun, AT 6AM....4hrs of sleep. I got to guide the whole river and had Daniela and Bob in my raft. Putnam took another guide boat and we followed Frank. It went a lot better than I expected. The ferry went well(paddled our asses off), the Dumplings were ok and the best was the SURF! And Frank was there to see it. This time he can't pretend it didn't happen. We were in that hydrolic and could have stayed there all day. It made me nervous at the time, but was the best part of my weekend. Sunday night was spent at the condo. I was dead but fully prepared for a long night. I needed to try to disprove the reputation I earned from last year. I was successful. Lots of drinking and game playing. More time in the sauna with Mary and Marty, playing ""Never have I ever"". Crashed around 12 or 1.

Today: Up around 6 to clean all the mess we made. Then had to get back to campus for 8 to drop Daniela off. The rest of the day was spent at class/ recovering from the weekend/ studying for chemistry. 

Well there is much to be done before the end of the semester. And as Eric from Maine kept reminding me over the weekend, ""Go big or go home"" so bring it on!! I can take it.


My other favorite line of the weekend and the rest of the summer: ""You're a fucking raft guide; suck it up"""

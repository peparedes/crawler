"event","I attended a meeting for work for most of the day. At the start of the meeting, some yummy iced scones were provided. I was breaking off a chunk of the scone with my fingers and a chunk flew down my shirt. I've had scone in my cleavage for around 6 hours now. I'd fish it out, but I'm sitting in a public place now, and I guess it wouldn't really look very good if I started feeling myself up."

"event","I bought an apricot colored paint for my master bathroom. I foolishly decided to start painting without priming, and now my bathroom looks like a mottled creamsicle. Because the crazy lady who owned my condo before me used some sort of pink enamel paint in the bathroom - the coat I tried to paint today almost slid off it.
I'm thinking of doing some sort of sponge effect with a darker color to tone the orange down. After getting my husband to take a power sander to the wall, and then priming which I should have done in the first place."

"event","I'm slowly trying to erase the traces of the former owner of my condo, so I spent most of the afternoon putting down tape and dropcloths. Now most of the hallway is primer white, instead of dark depressing forest green."

"event","I had a job interview today. I was a little stressed about what to wear because my pants were around a centimeter too long, in that they dragged on the floor when I wore my normal shoes. It is a problem with petite sizes when you are under 5 feet 4 inches. So the only shoes I had that would work would be clogs or my brown heels. I figured clogs were too dowdy librarian, so I went with the brown heels with the little pink bows. I don't know if I got the job or not, but if shoes were a hiring criteria, I'd hope that I'd get some credit for being well-shod."

"event","Hey everyone,
    Well I'm still alive and at NMSU. This is my last semester though.  I should hopeful;ly be going to Arazona next year.  It is going to be hard moving even farther from my friends and leaving my friends here.  Expeacially now.  college is the best time of your life don't let anyone tell you diffrent but you must leave eventually. Unless your name is Patric and you are a 7th yr sr. Long story if you don't understand.  I have come by the school and talked to you guys some of you have grown up so much even for just less then a year.  When I go back I feel really old, but I'm always happy to see you guys.  Some of you are just like my family and I think about you all the time so stay safe and know that I love you.  I just wanted to write a lil note now that I'm done. Let me say once again I love you.
LOVE
Jess"

"event","Ok so this is it.  I'm not goin to hide ANymore.  I'm not one to hide so I have no Idea why I have been doing it so much but now its time for it to stop.  Jon is gone yet again, he is sposted to leave to Iraq again In febuary, I'm so happy :( But I mean what can you do.  Ummmmm I was goin out with this other guy for a while wrong thing to do. Moved way to fast and now feel like he is stacker boy and have no one here to save me from him.  He calls all the time and tells my voice mail that he loves me but he scares me, hes not the nices guy when he has been drinking and hes got kids and well the list goes on and If you can't tell Its not like I'm ready to setle anyway. I mean there are still these feelings for Jon but I mean there will always be and with him coming in and out of my life like he does right now I can't just be with one person.  I think I do just fine as a free agant.  When I need to feel loved I mean I have friends shit I have a lot of them and I know they are there when I need them so Its not like i'm alone so why be tied down.  I was told college is the best times of your life and at frist I never thought It could top some of thoses High school Moments ""SPRING BREAK"" for example but man it has.  I never want it to end but it might and sooner then exspected to but we will just have to see.  It has its ups and downs but thats Life The people that you meet in colege and become close friends to will always be you friends.  They will see you at your worst and at your best.  But they will never leave.  But you need to be free so you can see all of this.  I never relized this until just the other day.  I know if I need the ""boyfriend"" figure I have him but when I'm there I need nothing but goodtimes and friends. Parties and memories that will last forever.  Its great and I hope you all have loved you time where you are as much as I Have. LOVE YOU ALL

PARTY ON

I'm all you High school people still have drama in your lives. But let me give you something to look forward too. Drama really happens here and when it does you get to chose how far its goin to go. You can walk away or make something of it.  No one really cares what you do as long as it doesn't fuck with thier life. So heres the thing, Don't care what people think and drama will slowly slip away. AND DRINK DOEsn't HURT EITHER. 
  Life here has been party tastic I can't beleave i'm already in the 3rd week it al seems so fast. Until I stared to think about you people. BRAIN AND BRENDA I miss you guys so much. My lil ones I hope you still have a blast in high school. And everyone else I miss as well.  I got wasted at a party the other night to where i was pratically cralling home and It made me think OF THE OLD TIMES. Mad me miss you guys even more. I know i don't update as much as a should but in a way thats good right cause that means that i'm bissy or havin fun. RIGHT? i don't know just know I need to get back to work and I miss you all very much.

Try to be happy. Try to live. Try to figure out whats wrong. Finally can't lie to anyone, not even myself.  Sadness has finally taken over. Life seems so empty.  Life seems so nonimportant, so usless. Life no longer existes.  Sit and stare at the blank wall and think."

I haven't really felt like goin out lately but I don't know we will see. I have been really sick but i think i made myself sick from all the messed up stuff in my life.  BUT I'm not the only one with problems and I need to keep remindin MYSELF that.  BUT yeah.  I'm not at the stage where shit happens and there is nothin I can do about it.  FATE WILL HAPPEN.

OH MAN, I was at my friends house the other day, and her friend was talkin and then she asked, ""THOSE guy that are in the war killin all those ppl do u think they go to hevan"" I was in total shock. I've been asked strage q's before but never anything like that.  I was just in shock that someone would think that.  I don't know Just Something I NOT used to I GUess.

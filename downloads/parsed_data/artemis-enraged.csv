"event","<font size=""-2"">[spirits come come]

sing to me my muses
lost in hot cyclops anarchy
possession, invention ... blood, blood
spirits, spirits .... come, cum ... 

where will these visions lead?
how far dare i go?
where will this song take me?
into the deep UNKNOWN!

SPIRITS SPIRITS COME COME!

I.

all the prophets & the gods came prepared for theirs
so we dined on the vine of the mind in pairs

preaching werewolf prayers on our nightly flight
gestating all we ate in the pale moonlight

feel the urge of the power surge -- ignite the soul
bringing kingdoms under siege with the words that i control

got an arsenal, ganja blunts & such
only love can set me free from this Patriarchal clutch

speaking testaments in our secret dialogue
while the drones begin to feast on the feces of the hog

take a walk in the wilderness of your mind
before your soul decides to die & leaves infinity behind

[chorus]

POSSESSION
INVENTION
INVITE DISCOVERY

SURRENDER
TO PLEASURE
LOST IN ECSTASY!

SURVIVE
ALIVE
YOU ARE MY ENEMY

YOU DIED
FOR LIES
SLAVES TO MISERY

II.

down on the battleground laying waste to competition
eye'm collecting intellects & exhaling solar systems

eye decree mutiny ....
its REVOLUTION US against the Patriarchy

the assembler of souls full of knowledge untold
while eye'm spinning webs of wisdom, prophecies unfold

into attack mode to decipher the code
of Babylon's terror spawn - tyranny reloads

into the mental stasis - apathy erases
the urgency of rage & its frightening little places

prepare for warfare
the afterbirth of knowledge is Americas nightmare 

[chorus]

[bridge]

sometimes eye sit and ask myself ...
WHAT HAVE EYE BECOME!!!???

something's taking over me ... 

POSSESSION
FREE ME NOW
ASHURA
ISHTAR
KALI
AVENGE ME ... AVENGE ME.

paint your face with the blood of the weak
self sacrifice everyone u meet
screaming demons in my veins
voices of the dead nurturing my pain


eye survived
eye'm alive

eye spread the fever
to watch u burn
killed your leaders
to help u learn

eye survived
eye'm alive

"event","It was midafternoon when Raeith sat on the step in front of their shack, a small carving knife and a piece of wood [Note to self: find which types of wood would be common in the area, and which of those are better for carving.] in his callused hands. He'd only picked up carving a couple of years before, and even without a teacher he'd managed to develop his skill to a passable level. His friends liked what he made, and that was enough for him. There was no money to be made from it anyway.

He was challenging himself this time, determined to make a small horse without accidentally breaking off one of the slender legs. Having only seen horses in photographs, he was going from half-memory and half-fancy. Neither was altogether reliable on its own, but he didn't care.

As he worked, he became aware of Patrick's presence nearby. He always felt Patrick's approach before he saw him, but he didn't stop his work. He knew Patrick's ways: his lover would make himself known when and how he chose, and would state his purpose or lack thereof.

Patrick sat beside Raeith on the wooden porch, shoulders and hips touching, and peered over Raeith's shoulder. ""Making another horse for Sky?"" The question was part of a game they played. Patrick would ask stupid questions with lots of extra information, as a way of reminding Raeith of things he'd most likely forgotten, so he wouldn't have to tell him outright and they could both pretend Raeith's brain wasn't full of holes. Raeith had no memory of giving his son a horse, or of ever having made a horse. On the other hand, he was glad Patrick had at least recognized what the carving was supposed to be. That meant he was on the right track.

Still, there was an inkling of defiance in Raeith's mind. With a sudden movement he chopped off the horse's front legs. ""No. It's going to be a dog. He doesn't need two horses, does he?""

Patrick chuckled. ""I guess you're right. You should make a wolf instead of a dog, though. Dogs are sellouts.""

Raeith snickered. ""You're right. They are. Damn them human lovers.""

That made them both laugh, forgetting everything else for the moment."

"event","There's not too much to say here yet, but Artemis Enraged will feature once again characters from <lj user=""apollo_rising""> and perhaps one or two left over from <lj user=""mercury_u"">. I expect it to bring some sort of closure to the trilogy, with room for more.

So here I will do the brainstorming and pre-prod and drafting of this thing. In the months to come. Can't say when."

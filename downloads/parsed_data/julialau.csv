"event","Julia is accoutred in a silver strapless gown of silk brocade that falls effortlessly to float around her feet. A five inch wide band of matching silk brocade serves as a high belt under her breasts and cinches her slender waist to make her shape more supple. The skirt of the dress features matching elaborately embroidered panels of delicate floral design down the front. The rich violet embroidery creates a striking contrast to the silver.

Her hanfu, a traditional silk brocade robe, is a perfect match to the gown as it drapes on the edges of her shoulders and falls to the floor in a shimmering, embroidered train. The sleeves of the hanfu bell and taper like exotic flowers and hides her hands from sight. When she moves, a sheer, purple ribbon of silk flutters from where it graces the bends of her arms, and when she pauses, it falls to the floor with her hanfu. 

Her dress, poise, posture, and form are beautiful, but they are to be rivaled by her visage. Her lips are painted red, and her lids are lined in black to accent the angles of her large, velvet eyes. The rest of the make-up is natural. Her long neck is exposed as her obsidian locks have been pulled up into a large bun on the top of her head. A large, vintage ivory comb with carved cherry blossoms on the top has been placed amongst her hair bindings. It is simple but elegant. A long tendril of silk flowers falls from behind her right ear. A few white and purple orchids are tucked and pinned to create a natural and sweet-scented crown for her. Overall, while the look is ornate and rich, Julia wears it with elegance and a sense of majesty.

"event","<i>My computer spazzed, and the log for this was lost. But the IC date was August 24, 2006, before midnight. Now for the summary...</i>

Julia enters Something Wicked. Dressed as she is, the delicate, Asian woman looks out of place here. She looks around, but the effort is futile from this vantage point. Julia heads over the booths at a graceful, measured pace, and she seems to be looking for something.

A man with blue-hair is here with a sketchpad in front of him. His attention is on the crowd. But then he sees the small Asian woman who looks out of place, and his focus locks on her. He looks at her long enough to be considered rude.

Julia freezes when she realizes she has someone's attention. She turns to look at him. Her pulse quickens, and she smells like fear, anxiety. What makes this interesting is that she approaches the blue-haired man despite her apprehension. ""Excuse me, sir, but may I have the pleasure of your company for a few minutes?""

The blue-haired man agrees to this in French. He stands and motions that she should sit. Julia thanks him in French then introduces herself in a soft, measured voice. It seems each word she uses is considered prior to use. She tells him she was told she could find vampires at this club.

The blue-haired man confirms this and tells her that vampires are throughout the club. She agrees with him, and he asks her why she seeks a vampire. She tells him she needs to make an informed decision, and he again replies to her with a question. ""Why do you seek vampires for this decision?"" She says it is delicate, but that she wants to know what the master of the city is like. He asks why. Julia shakes her head, excuses herself, apologizes for monopolizing his time, and thanks him for his patience. He offers her his condolences, and Julia thanks him again before turning away.

A slick looking vampire sits at another booth with two thugs for guards. His power is more than the blue-haired man's was, and Julia knows this is bad news. Instead, she turns for the bar. However, before the small woman can reach the bar, she is stopped by a man who grabs her wrist and grins down at her. Julia glares at him and twists her wrist free. Her courage is gone now, and she leaves the club."

"event","<b>Black Swan Studio and Spa: Reception Area</b> - Lake Shore Drive: North
<i>The floor is a pale hardwood as is the ceiling above. The walls are painted a pale, sage green. The seating area is to the left of the door. The chairs are brown and sleek, expensive looking and comfortable. There is a small, low table in the middle of the room with a stack of health and style magazines. To the right, there is a counter of hand-selected brown tile. The top of the counter is a darker stone, solid and heavy looking. Behind the counter, there is tall stool and a computer, and over the counter are several long shelves with bottles and jars of various creams, oils, and exfoliants of various sizes- all natural, of course, and many of them made here.

There is an open doorway on the left side of the room, although a shoji privacy screen prevents most ogling.</i>

Walking down the commercially popular and financially lucrative Lake Shore Drive, James and Emma encounters a new store being developed. A new store in this area of town is nothing terribly exciting, of course, as there are frequently new stores popping up and shutting down and popping up again. But this one is particularly attractive. Of course, why wouldn't a studio and spa attract a sensual artist like James? He is walking as he usually is, his arm around Emma's waist, his hips close to hers, when he stops to investigate. ""Ooo...Black Swan. I haven't seen this here before. New, shiny new.""

Black Swan Studio and Spa is not open yet. There is a sign outside that says it will open October 1. Occasionally, vans pull in with deliveries, and some of the employees come and go as the shop is still being decorated and stocked. This Wednesday afternoon, none of the vans or trucks are here, and Julia is the only one in attendance at the moment. The outside of the building is brown stone, and the front double doors are glass with brass handles. Julia, a delicate, oriental woman of about twenty-six sits on a tall stool behind a tiled counter. She is busy at the computer but looks up to notice two individuals outside. She pushes black-framed glasses up on her tiny nose and waves to the passers-by.

Emma's eyes fall to the sign before she peeks inside, holding James lightly around the shoulders to accommodate their constant closeness to one other more comfortably. She lifts a hand to wave at the woman with in, smiling in a friendly, open fashion. ""I don't think they're open yet,"" she says to James, bringing her lips close to his ear. Though that's probably obvious to him, too. ""It would be neat to come by when they are, though.""

""It's neat /now/,"" he says, peeking through the door. Pretty Asian girl. Neat-ER. He waves at her, his nose to the glass, and mouths some words to her before realizing she can probably hear. ""Hi!"" he yells. ""What's your name?""

<lj-cut text=""Character Descriptions"">
<b>Emma</b>
<i>Emma maintains a presence commonly referred to as wanton and it compliments her lithe and attractive frame quite nicely. Her long, shapely limbs suggest more stamina than strength and carry her with an often unusually graceful stride. Her almond-shaped eyes are a deep shade of chocolate brown and mottled with flecks of gold. Full and pretty pink lips are expressive and playful and set beneath an appropriately perky nose. Her long, dark brown hair hangs loosely around her shoulders, nearly falling to the small of her back. It could probably be brushed, but the windswept strands hardly look messy.

Her clothes are sexy casual, at least that's probably what the style would be called if Emma could name it. She wears a black mini skirt, though it's not the sort of mini that reveals all when one turns around too quickly. Around her waist is a belt made out of a thin, silver-colored chain, with the extra length at the end hanging down and a little to the left of her center. Her legs are bare above her knee-length leather boots and the boots themselves are sort of a cross between combat and sexy. Her shirt is a black tank top with a lightning bolt outlined in blue rhinestones over her chest. Around her neck she wears a thin gold chain with a blue sapphire teardrop pendant.</i>

GAME> On James, you smell: 'not much'.
GAME> On Emma, you smell:  'Clean and feminine with the faint musk of vampire.'.
GAME> You sense James to be a fae, powerful, far far far less powerful than yourself.
GAME> You sense Emma to be a coyote shapeshifter <hot energy>, of inhuman Power, far less powerful than yourself.

<b>James</b>
<i>A tall, wiry man with deep, sky blue hair that flows down just past his shoulders. The blue color is striking, and matches his eyes. His skin is fair and light. He is clearly male, but has a graceful beauty about him that is both masculine and feminine. He's got on tight blue jeans that flatter the hell out of what's underneath them, leaving only just enough to the imagination. He's got on a black tank top as well, and his black, leather biker jacket, specially made with buttons and buckles of silver. His jewelry is simple, sapphire earrings, several bracelets, and two softly glowing amulets around his neck. His boots reach to his knee, and are tight with buckles that strap them to his calves.

Julia hops off the stool in an easy, measured grace and slips her glasses off. She walks around the counter and places the now folded glasses on the dark, stone surface. Her lips curl in a slow smile and she walks over to the doors. The right door is unlocked, and she pulls it open. Her expression is congenial, her eyes, serious. ""Hello,"" she says in an equally measured voice. The accent is Californian but tangible and soft. ""I'm Julia. I apologize. We aren't open yet, but if you'd like to come in... Perhaps take a look around?"" She steps back, holding the door open and smiling gently. ""If you would like,"" she repeats. <lj-cut text=""Read On"">

Emma doesn't really answer since it was James that pulled them over here. Emma would just as happily go somewhere else, but she smiles at this Julia person warmly. ""It seems really nice,"" she says conversationally, turning her gaze from the blue-haired man to the woman as though she fully expects him to take Julia up on the offer.

But of course! It's a rule of his. Whenever an attractive woman invites you in, you always say yes. So he does indeed enter, slipping his arm from Emma's waist and instead taking her hand, which makes moving through a doorway far easier, he steps inside past Julia and begins looking around. ""Sign says studio and spa. Can you tell me about that? What does it mean studio? Art gallery?""

Julia smiles at the woman, ""Thank you."" She steps back again and waits for them to pass. ""You seem to possess a great deal of energy,"" Julia says to the man. To the woman, Julia asks politely as she closes the door and prepares to answer any questions, the blue-haired ones currently, ""Is he always this enthusiastic?"" The small, Asian woman steps away from the door. She seems to move in her own world, at her own pace. It is not slow, not retarded, but it is not fast. It is as if every moment and movement and word is weighted, and she must know it all just a little. ""I can,"" she says to the man. ""This is a studio, but here we study living, art, beauty, good health."" There is a small laugh. ""And we do have a small art gallery, I suppose, but we only show what the owner buys."" To the man, she asks with good nature in her eyes, ""Are you an artist?""

Emma holds onto James' hand loosely, but not as though she's going to let go anytime soon. She looks around curiously before her attention comes back around to the woman. ""Oh, yeah. Most of the time, at least. It's charming, don't you think?"" she says, looking at James with an open smile. She falls silent to listen to the Asian woman speak about the place, letting her gaze wander again.

James nods emphatically. ""Yes! I can paint and I can take pictures. Emma is an art student. She does abstract nature art. Might be more appropriate for this place than my work."" He grins and continues looking around, dragging Emma along a few steps in each direction as he pokes around. Then he turns back to Julia and gives a nod of approval. ""Looks nice. What kind of services will you be providing at the spa?""

Julia nods at the woman's question, ""Yes, I think so."" She smiles at the man. Indeed, charming... ""Really?"" Her slanted brown eyes widen as she looks from the man to the woman. ""Abstract nature art? That is something I would be interested in, actually. Photographs, too, of course. Black and white is often very soothing for people, and I enjoy collecting photographs. Perhaps if either of you are ever interested in selling some pieces? I would like for the art displayed her to be by local artists."" She watches them move or, rather, him drag her about some. ""Thank you,"" she inclines her head politely. ""Our specialty is the Black Swan Massage which is a blend of several massage approaches: Japanese shiatsu, Thai Hawaiian Lomi Lomi, Swedish and Balinese. Of course, we offer each of these separately as well and affordably, too, particularly for regular or favored customers."" She smiles more broadly at this. We also offer various facials, full body masks, scrubs, and wraps with access to the pools and saunas after such visits. There are yoga instructions as well as Shirodhara and Stone Massage..."" She pauses in consideration.

""Oh, well, it's usually more a mix of realism and abstract. I can stick with one or another on a piece, other things, too, but that's usually what happens."" Emma tries to clarify a little bit. She wouldn't want anyone to be disappointed, after all. ""Unfortunately I can't get to most of my pieces right now."" A brief frown that's gone when James moves and she either needs to moves with him or release him. She's obviously unwilling to do the latter. ""Oh, that sounds fun, baby, doesn't it? We should come and get massages when this place opens up.""

James nods again, moving back a little closer to Emma when he's stationary again. He stands against her, placing his hand on her chest, taking the necklace that hangs down between her breasts in his lithe and loving fingers, and staring at it with great adoration. ""Yes,"" he says, ""that sounds wonderful. The sign says it opens in October. We'll have to come for certain."" His eyes turn up toward Julia, and he smiles, a calmer smile than his initial flighty expression upon entering the place. ""I do some black and white photos, though my subjects are primarily women. Often without clothing. I don't know if it would be appropriate.""

Julia says to both with a small smile, ""Well, if you are ever interested in parting with any available piece, let me know. I might not hang nudes downstairs, but at home, that would be a different matter."" She watches them both. ""Here,"" she says, stepping away and moving over to the counter. ""Since you two are the first to take an interest and visit Black Swan, and you both seem so nice, I will put you down for a free couple's massage, the Black Swan specialty, of course."" She wiggles the mouse at her computer. ""If you would just leave me with your names, please, I will make a note should you call to schedule a visit."" She pauses, ""Walk-ins are welcome, but the wait time is often long and tedious."" From behind the counter, Julia glances up, her eyes busy with thought yet patient.

Emma nods her head. ""I'll keep you in mind if I can get my hands on anything. Or maybe I can try something new that I can bring in. I've never sold a piece that wasn't actually commissioned by someone."" She gives a little shrug, but brightens at the mention of a free couple's massage. ""Oooh, I like the sound of that. Is this a franchise?"" she asks, considering what the woman says about wait times considering this place is new.

James leans off of Emma while holding her, as though she is a firepole on which he might dance. He places a hand on the counter to lean a little closer to Julia, whose interest in his artwork has suddenly made her the potential subject of flirtation. ""Yes, the couples' massage sounds delicious. Tell me what that is, would you? In as much detail as possible..."" He concludes this request with a little lick of his lips, maybe a bit of a tease, or maybe they were just dry...

""Thank you,"" Julia says to the woman. Then when asked if this is a franchise, the Asian woman shakes her head tenderly. ""No, it is not. Opening this place was my dream. But I have spent the last eight years in this business while either in school or strictly working. We staff according to intake, and I like work to be constant but unhurried. There is only enough staff here daily for the amount of appointments we have. We have four private massage rooms, one couple's room, one dividable couple's room, and two singles'."" With a smile and nod to the man, Julia explains, ""A couple's massage... A full tissue massage. Both partners are attended at the same time, side by side with a masseuse each. It really depends on what package is purchased, but for the Black Swan Massage it is: the blended massage, a floral soak, then a trip to the sauna and showers, of course. There really isn't much to tell, sir. It's a personal, quiet, soothing, relaxing, and an exotic experience."" She smiles broadly. ""So if you'd like, just give me your names.""

Emma ohs quietly, maybe worried that she's said something wrong. But she's quick to smile again. ""It must be wonderful to see a dream come true. I've always wanted to open my own gallery."" But this isn't really the place to talk about it, so Emma doesn't dwell on the thought. She listens to the explanation given to James curiously, then she glances at him. ""Emma Moore,"" she offers her own name. She's all for the idea.

James continues leaning forward with that flirtatious expression, and only offers, ""James."" He leans back again, holding to his firepole more closely and tightly, turning his gaze up to her momentarily to flash a look to her eyes that shows how interested he is in the idea as well. He can't help giving her neck a little kiss, just below her ear.

Julia smiles. ""Thank you, Emma, James."" She bends over the computer. There is the clacking of computer keys, and Julia looks up again. ""I am very excited about this."" She sighs softly and looks beyond the glass doors. The small smile there seems to reach her eyes. ""When you come back, you get to see the spa."" Julia looks to them. ""It is my pride and joy now. And... I really should get back to work if you don't mind."" Her expression is a gentle one. ""Please come back. And tell your friends about this place, too. I am thinking about offering memberships here. It would be cheaper, but only if you visit the spa often."" She moves around the counter in her comfortable steps and steps over by the door.

Emma lifts her head just a little and to the side to give James better access to her neck, but she's mostly watching Julia. ""Thank you so much. I think the membership thing sounds like a wonderful idea. I'm sure we would be more than happy to come in on a regular basis. Or at least I would,"" she grins and nudges James' head back so she can kiss his check. She grabs one of his hands and makes to lead him out so that the woman can go about her work in peace. ""It was nice meeting you, Julia.""

""Yes,"" he says, slightly dazed after receiving a kiss on the cheek, but dazed with a goofy happy smile. ""Quite pleasant. A very pleasant outing, full of shiny new spas. I will bring you a picture or two next time I visit that you might be interested in?"" It's not a question but his voice inflects it as such.

Julia smiles and nods as she opens the door. ""Well, I will consider it more closely. I like the idea of giving something back, something /more/ to those the Black Swann will see often."" To James, she says, ""Yes, please, I would love that."" To Emma, Julia follows with, ""And I would not mind talking with you another time about a commission, but I will save that for the next time I see you."" She smiles and waves them off. ""Thank you for visiting.""</lj-cut>"

The weather is starting to get freaken horrible its gonna like snow like 3 times more in the next week like today wasnt bad enough which i walked home in and almost froze in. im gonnna go to junction maybe friday maybe tommarow since its five bucks. i wanna try to lipslid the handrail at junction i also wanna heelflip board the handrail only if like chad or someones filming so i get it on film. ive found some wicked good spots with brett and erik but its a secret so i cant give u details. anyways since i havnt updated this sucker in a while i just guessed i would update it and boy was that a long update and im just sitting here listening to music chillin and doing homework so i g2g i guess ull just have to wait for another update to hear from me and how my lifes going

"event","I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase


When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts
My once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away
All the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me"

I feel your touch so close and real
And I know
My church is not of silver and gold,
Its glory lies beyond judgement of souls
The commandments are of consolation and warmth

You know our sacred dream won't fail
The sanctury tender and so frail
The sacrament of love
The sacrament of warmth is true
The sacrament is you

I hear you weep so far from here
I taste your tears like you're next to me
And I know
My weak prayers are not enough to heal
The ancient wounds so deep and so dear
The revelation is of hatred and fear

You know our sacred dream won't fail
The sanctury tender and so frail
The sacrament of love
The sacrament of warmth is true
The sacrament is you
The sacrament is you
The sacrament is you
The sacrament is you
The sacrament is you

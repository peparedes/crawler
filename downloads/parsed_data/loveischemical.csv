</CENTER>
i want the job at the floral shop and i really don't know why.
i hate working and i love flowers.
kelsey should tell caroline to come find me and give my hair a trim.
we rock for having the exact same hair.
i feel sick and i need to eat something.
i believe in keeping songs on repeat for hours.
a man just showed up with a package and i had to sign for it on a scary computer thing.
my stomach is more tan than my legs.
i bought tangerine runuculas last night.
i hope dani and i go get ice cream at Madonna Inn on friday.
i think kelsey and caroline should come with us. 
you have to dress up like wenches, though.
we can go back to Los Osos and have our mexican fiesta.
i think it's obvious i miss kelsey and caroline.
they're the only reason i would go back to Morro Bay High.
now i hate San Luis High, and i want to go to PB.
people fucking suck.
i might start staying at my Dad's because i miss walking to Chapala Market for mexican candy and then across the street to the beach in the morning.
those were good mornings.
i miss my stepsister.
i miss my empty room with the chinese mirrors and all matching wicker furniture.
i almost miss the smell.
i don't miss the memories.
i don't want to sleep in that bed again, it holds everything i need to forget.
maybe i'll just get a lock on my door.
fill my little pink bookcase back up.
sit in the sun at the beach with my mexican candy.
walk up the street to Matiana's and let her cook for me and give me 40's hairstyles.
let Alejo finally teach me how to dance.
i'm not shy anymore.
my boyfriend has the hottest butt, ever.
i love rambling."

"event","""<I>Let me tell you something from experience. I will be first to admit I do not have a great deal of experience with relationships, but my experience is solidly convincing of one thing.

You will be hurt more than you could ever envision and you will feel better than you could ever imagine possible. After each relationship we want to close up and never let anyone in again. And you would be a fool for doing so.

The stories I could tell would make your head spin. I have been broken and hurt to almost cartoony levels (and I am not exaggerating or feeling sorry for myself; there is a typical ""lynch mob"" reaction when I tell some of the things that have happened) And I wouldn't change a thing.

Really, when you get down to it, what do you have to lose? You pour your heart out, you get rejected and hurt, and you grow. And you feel better for getting it all off of your chest. And you are no longer tormented about telling this person. And it is better than being cold and alone.

Or they accept. And things work out.

The way I see it, There might be a day when I can no longer have such a romantic outlook, when I have worn my heart on my sleeve for the last time, when I must proceed into every relationship with the utmost level of caution. There will be a day when I could never have believed I could have rushed into things like this. And that will be the day that every part of me except my bodily functions dies.

Go out and open yourself up and be romantic and fall in love and get hurt while you still have the heart to. There is more beauty in it than you could ever imagine.

So cheer up there. Eat Ben and Jerry's from the carton and watch American beauty with all of your friends. It will change your mind about things.</I>""

i struggled against it with every shallow breath. i would be awake for hours, hearing the steady waves outside my door and waiting for what i knew would eventually come. i walked the halls, i stalked the halls, trying madly to stay awake until __ went away, only to pass out onto the carpeted corridor and get yelled at the next day.

You're <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>!<br>
<font size=""4"">by Lewis Carroll</font><br>
<i><font size=""3"">After stumbling down the wrong turn in life, you've had your mind
opened to a number of strange and curious things. As life grows curiouser and curiouser,
you have to ask yourself what's real and what's the picture of illusion. Little is coming
to your aid in discerning fantasy from fact, but the line between them is so blurry that
it's starting not to matter. Be careful around rabbit holes and those who smile to much,
and just avoid hat shops altogether.</font><br>

they're never scary, just sad, just memories that i don't prefer to relive over and over everynight for the next few years. 

waking up, then crying. 
and starting all over again.
my body isnt warm enough on its own."

<b>All the things you got,
All the things you need.
Who bought you cigarettes and bribed the company
To come and see you, honey?

I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
<U>These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet.</U>
But they don't know what I know, and why should you care?
When I'm not there.

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest.
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed.
But I'm playing with myself, what do you care?
When I'm not there.

All the things you got, you'll never need,
All the things you got, I'm planning to bleed to, please you.

Been thinking about you."

"event","i'm at school, but i dont think i'll go to class. people sort of piss me off and talk too much, so that's no good at all. it's Belch's class anyways, so it never really matters if you come in 20 minutes late.

i've been thinking about religion lately. such a touchy subject. it's hard to tell whether it's fashionable to be Christian or to hate Christians. i'm an anti-christian christian. i believe jesus is my savior, but i dont go around using him as an excuse to hurt other people. i've also always felt that there's nothing wrong with other religions. no one is lower than me and they're not exactly wrong in their beliefs either. it's a choice, and my choice is Jesus. i'll also tell you what i think about him if you want, but if you tell me not to i will never go around stuffing my beliefs down your throat.


nevermind, i guess i should go now."

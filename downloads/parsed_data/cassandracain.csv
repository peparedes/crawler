Swinging through the night air, her knuckles pleasantly sore, a faint stinging in her ribs from a lucky punch, she can almost understand poetry, the temptation to string together beautiful words, the better to describe the sense of serenity and peace she can only find in the most unique of places.

It shoudl disturb her, she knows this.  Normal girls, whatever <i>those</i> are, don't do what she's doing.  A normal girl her age would be tucked away safely in bed, thoughts filling her head of her boyfriend, or girlfriend, wondering what new movie they'd be going to not-watch while they explored each other physically in the back row.  Normal wants and needs for normal boys and girls:  Shoes, sex, the things they were told that they couldn't do.

Not Cassandra Cain.  She wanted to hear the night fly by her ears, whistling as it passed, in a way not many others could ever hear.  She had cause to wonder what it was that made her different, deciding it had to be the influence of that rotten tooth of a man who'd sired her, and then those thoughts were gone again, borne away on the wind by a laugh as her stomach dropped out, and she dove thirty feet before snagging a grotesque's outstretched concrete wing with her jump-line, and swinging just above the lightpoles along this street rushing by below."

Words for this, words for that.  

Everything has a word for it.  

Sometimes, too many words.  The letters are a struggle, even now.  Most signs, she still identifies by their shape.  Oracle's been patient in her attempts to help, but the reading is difficult.  She gets discouraged easily.

Even now, it afects her memories.  They have texture, but lack tone.  The words he spoke meant nothing then, they mean as much now, greyed out by the fog of time.  They sit, just out of reach, and it frustrates her to the point of silent tears in the night.  

Others have clear memories of their childhoods.  Hers are based around a person's stance, what their shoulders and hips did, the positions of their hands.

These two should be <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/_nightwing_"">Nightwing's</a> problem.  But he's got a baby, and a wife.  Two things Cassandra doesn't have.

So, when a report comes over the wire of two identically dressed acrobats robbing the penthouse of the Cathcart Towers, she takes it.  She's been training on her new motorcycle.  Twelve minutes, fourteen seconds from her cave to the Towers.  A verbal command locks the tires of the bike and engages the bolt-thrower hidden in the ignition system.  Anyone trying to boost the bike gets a nasty surprise.

The twins in the yellow costumes are faster than she is.  More used to using their surroundings as both weapon and obstacle course.  But she can anticipate some of their moves.  The sets of their shoulders, the position of their feet signalling subtly their intention to leap this way or that.

A pivot-turn-kick, and one of the brightly-clad twins is kicked just as she leaps, sending her crashing into a wall, leading with her chin.  The other curses in a language Cassandra does not understand, and dives at her, the thought of escape driven away by the picture of her sister being knocked unconscious.

""Stupid,"" Cassandra says quietly, blocking every clumsy blow.  These girls are good at the flipping and dodging, not so much at the fighting.  

Sixty seconds later, the cold night wind ripples Cassandra's cape as she binds the wrists of the two girls.

""O.  Bad girls.  Caught them,"" she says into her wrist-mic, catching her breath."

His form sucks.

She ignores the gunman for the moment.  He is not a danger.  A flick of her wrist sends a dart at the fourth, pinning his knifehand to his thigh.  He screams, but she doesn't hear, too intent on the fighter.  She blocks a knife-hand with her forearm.  The heel of her hand thumps against his temple, dropping him instantly.  His head will ache for the next two days.  A back kick sends the gun, finally liberated from it's cloth confinement, skittering across the blacktop.  The man who pulled it stands there, looking at his empty hand as though willing the gun back into it.  She kicks his knees from under him, hands planted on the pavement, and rolls backward into a handstand, heels cracking the underside of his jaw sharp enough to close his eyes.

<b>Harshly</b>.

Answered call to Arkham Asylum, report follows:

Explosion in violent prisoner's block.  Eyewitness accounts collected from two guards, one doctor, and Professor Jonathan Crane.  Most reliable report seems to be from Professor Crane, involving what was apparently a 7 foot reproduction of the Joker, weilding a machine gun, and singing what was apparently a song by someone named ""Steve Miller"", whoever that is.

Two casualties on-site:  Cornelius Stirk, the cannibal killer from last year, and Robert Murphy, a member of Asylum security.  Examined bodies.  Although they were purportedly shot by the giant-Joker, there was no evidence of bullet wounds.  They may have, in fact, died from fright. 

Worst news:  There has been an escape from the Asylum in the confusion.  Harvey Dent is on the street again. 

Will begin to look for him at nightfall tomorrow.

The library.

I checked out the collected works of Arthur Conan Doyle.  I like mysteries.  And becoming better at solving them will help in our work.

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/_thebatman_"">He</a> suggested I try Sherlock Holmes, so I am.

As I was leaving, a young boy was being picked on by bigger boys.  I was going to intervene, and another person did.

He looked maybe a year younger than <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/_robin_"">Robin</a>, with red hair, and a thinner face.  He moved like a fighter, and used a short staff, almost an escrim stick.  No lasting damage, no difficult strikes...but he seemed to know the basics well.

We talked.  His name is Lonnie.  He bought me an ice cream soda.

He was really nice.  Although a little young."

So, I kicked out his knee.  I know it broke.  

He's awaiting transfer somewhere...I'm not certain where...Santa Prisca, probably.

"event","A quick little update, since it's been awhile:

<i>Signal To Noise</i> was completed at the end of February. You may listen to some of the tracks on <a href=""http://myspace.com/transmitmusic"">the Transmit Myspace page</a>, and if you're interested in purchasing the album as high-quality 320K MP3's (also available in FLAC and Apple Lossless formats) for only US$5, you can do so at <a href=""http://transmit.bandcamp.com"">Transmit's new MP3 storefront at bandcamp.com</a>. The plan is still to create a limited edition CD version of the album as well, but that will come later.

Work is also underway for the next Transmit release, which will be different in that it will not be the product of <a href=""http://www.rpmchallenge.com"">Record Production Month</a>. Sonically, this release will see a deeper examination of the dark synthpop style found in tracks such as <i>Kick</i>. A tentative release date (which is by no means set in stone) is 22 September 2009.

"event","<div align=justify>On Monday, I finished my entry into the <i>Suck</i> Remix Competition hosted by <a target=""somewhere_else"" href=""http://www.undergroundinc.com/"">Underground Inc.</a> Remixing a classic Pigface song was a lot of fun, though I'm not sure about my final product. I wish I could share it with you, but I am forbidden from doing so by the Remix Agreement I signed. Hopefully I'll win (!) and you will be able to buy it on a CD from <a href=""http://www.invisiblerecords.com/"" target=""somewhere_else"">Invisible Records</a>. Personally, I think my remix is cool, but I'm not sure it will stand up to the crazy ideas other people have about doing remixes. I spent a good bit of time trying to do things in the weirdest way possible, but some of those things may be too subtle for the average listener to figure out. Some of my equipment was really stretched to its limit (and beyond), and that really makes me very proud.

Unfortunately, I didn't spend enough time on it. This is partially my fault and partially outside influences. I discovered the competition in late October and the deadline was originally 20 November! I thought it was a little tight, but I wanted to try. I filled out the paperwork and faxed it in, and about a week later, a CD arrived in my mailbox with the remix elements on it. However, there was a teeny problem: the CD was cracked. Actually, cracked would be an understatement. It was just barely not in two pieces and completely unusable. I wrote an email asking for a replacement. I waited another week. Nothing. At this point, I was starting to panic and thought that I wouldn't get a chance after all to enter, so I wrote again. Finally, about two and a half weeks ago, a number I didn't recognize called my cell and I let voicemail get it. It was Underground Inc. and they wanted me to call back, so I did. I talked to a very friendly young lady who said she would FedEx me a new CD the following day in a protective envelope. The same day, I got home to find a copy of the CD in my mail and it was totally fine. The FedEx'ed copy arrived about three days after that. Okay, so I ended up with one broken and two functioning copies. Funny how that happens. And to top it all off, they extended the deadline to 27 November.

The actual work on the remix went in three spurts: the evening when I finally had a working copy of the remix elements, the day after, and the 16 hours leading up to when I finally mailed it in this past Monday. That means that there was a gap of about two weeks where I wasn't really bothering. Whoops. Well, hey, that's inspiration for you.</div>"

"event","I said I would be ""done"" by the end of the summer, and here we are several weeks into autumn. Out of the 14 tracks that I mentioned in June, only about five remain...but there are about a dozen others that have begun since then. To say I'm a bit overwhelmed would be an understatement.

I recently read an interview with Douglas McCarthy of Nitzer Ebb. He mentioned that many bands that came from the early 80s era in the UK were on the dole, and this is why they had so much time to spend on their musical creations and had perfected such wonderful noises so early in their lives. I don't have this luxury (who does anymore?) so I'm afraid the waiting must continue for the forseeable future."

"event","It's been crazy trying to make the time to work on my material. I was planning on having a ""demo"" completed by the end of the summer, but it's going in so many directions and I only have so much time. It's no fun to work a real job and take care of everyday life tasks, but I'm sure you also have plenty of experience in that department.

Here are some tentative song names and a little bit about what each of them sounds like. I hope to have some mp3s up soon. I actually do have mp3s I could share, but I feel that they're not quite up to snuff.

<b>Onward</b> - Rather straight-ahead ""futurepop"", and accidentally so.

<b>Superstar</b> - Rock/funk/industrial.

<b>Wrapped Up</b> - I'm so proud of this one. I can't pigeonhole it into a genre.

<b>Things You Do</b> - Synthpop, but with a sleazy edge to it.

<b>Plush Girl</b> - My attempt at making electronic shoegazer music. Eat your heart out, Kevin Shields.

<b>Howl</b> - Sort of IDM. Definite influences from Plaid, Aphex Twin, etc. So far, just an instrumental.

<b>Hot/Cold</b> - Same vibe as <i>Superstar</i>. Go figure that both songs are me venting about other people.

Those are the ones that are furthest along. There are 30+ others that just haven't gotten off the ground yet.

In addition, I'm preparing some cover versions, but I don't want to divulge too much about those right now. I don't want to be known for doing cover versions. I'm making them for two main reasons: 1) it's a great way to learn more about the programs and instruments with which I'm working without having to focus so much on the songwriting; and 2) it would be nice to have a couple of cover songs to do in a live setting, just to bridge the gap between the audience and my music. It will hopefully give people another vantage point from which to view Transmit."

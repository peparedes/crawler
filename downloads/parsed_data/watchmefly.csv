further seems forever

This is the last time I'll try to reach you
and my guess is, you'll just ignore it, just ignore me
Without a passing glance
without the slightest sigh
without moving your hands
without the softest cry.

If I'd say
go your own way, I'll be with you
make mistakes and I'll forgive you
home is waiting here for you when you return.

Rain reveals the foundation
and this one's wearing thin
and shifting in the sand.

And the water does its damage
with its endless beating pulse
heralding the end

Without a passing glance
without the slightest sigh
wihtout moving your hands
without the softest cry

If Id say
go your own way, I'll be with you
make mistakes and I'll forgive you
home is waiting here for you when you return

Fall Out Boy - 

I'm good to go
And I'm going nowhere fast
It could be worse
It could be taking you there with me
I'm good to go
But it looks like I'm still on my own

I'm good to go
For something golden
Though the motions I've been going through have failed
And I'm coasting on potential towards the wall
At a 100 miles an hour

When I say
Two more weeks
My foot is in the door (yeah)
I can't sleep
In the wake of Saturday (Saturday)
Saturday
When these open doors were open-ended
Saturday
When these open doors were open-ended

Pete and I said attacked Astoria 
with promise and precision and mess of youthful innocence
And I read about the afterlife
But I never really lived more than an hour (more than an hour)

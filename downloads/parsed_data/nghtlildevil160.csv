"event","So I had this really messed up dream. Anybody on what it means? Any ideas on meaning please let me know, I'm stumped.

<lj-cut>
 So starts out with the weird ceromony of Hailee's birthday (yes I'm sorry you were in this, kyle too..) So on this brithday  a grand ritual happens of having to shot with an arrow the bottom out of this little basket, several guys try to do it and the one that succeeds is your lover. So yours happens and it was Kyle and you were both happy as can be. 
 Jumps to the next day, my brithday. I have to do this but I didn't know the full extent of the ritual so I just do it to the guy I want's basket and call it he won. When he comes over, I tell him. We are madly in love, and he kisses me. Oh for a dream it was one damn good kiss, ohhhh.. (lol)  
 Jump..So he's supposed to go to this family thing with me. But when I get all excited about it and is talking to Mr. Dine about it. He says he's having one, and suddenly my Mom decides shes gonna have hers with Mr. Dines and my bf was invited. It was a hoax to split us up. My bf runs away to be depressed cause he can't have me, but I eventually find him at the bottom of a pool hiding. So I dove down there, brought him up and talked with him. Telling him how much I loved him. So we decided to run away together. In order to do this though we have to hide away in Hailee's Basement for a little while. (Why? I have no idea)Her dad almost catches us, So we sneak off. Running down steps and jumping this, having a great time. 
 When suddenly we are a cruise ship, stowing away or stealing it I couldn't tell. Felt like I was stealing it, but we were running around and hiding from people, and starving. So more like stowing away, but ne ways the people on the ship wanted to find out despertatly. As we were hiding out. We ran aruound for a while, but we get hungry. So we steal some stuff and end up with enough to buy corn. (corn??) We go to a room to be alone and jsut talk and have our corn delivered. Only this is a suite and it happens tons of poeple are in it, we didn't mind. We just asked if we could use their balacony for a minute. The lady responded with her and her bf were leaving for a bit and didn't mind too much but as not to mess anything up. So we order the corn and suddenly we hear the gaurds coming. Scared we couldn't tell if they were coming from upstairs or down, so we go back and forth. Then we choose up stairs but get scared half way up and do down. The guards caught us, ends up The lady said we could use her balacony so she could catch us. It was her cruise ship and she was pissed. 
 Jump..I walk into a probahtion office, a gaurd standing on duty. Serveral people standing talk to me as I'm for some reason famous for my cruise stunt or something. Ne ways a friend of mine is working and tells me he needs to talk to me. So he takes me back in some bedroom, and wants me to help him steal somethiong of willy wonkas that really looks like something of the cat in the hats. We shut the door, alerting the guard until he comes looking to see whats going on. My friend and I chat for a while, and the gaurd comes in and tells us we have to leave teh room. 

End of dream..wow what a dream, but that kiss ohh lol

Any takers on comments or an explanation would most be appreciated."

"event","Ok I don't know what Al's problem is today but honestly he needs to grow up. Ok, hes sleeping on the couch in the Living room with Mom and Sammy. I get a phone call (that happens I think not even once a month) and answer it and continue the conversation I had with her where we had left off from earlier. Al waits a minute or two and insists Sam gets on the phone and answers. (I was in the kitchen) I hear her say hi, and I'm like ok whats are you doing? So I walk over there and ask her what shes doing? She looks scared, and Als all like I thought it was her mom. I'm like well if it was her mom wouldn't I have brought the phone in there and said her sam its your mom. Instead of just talking like I am. So I finish cooking and talking on the phone, and tell everyone to come eat. Mom calls Al in and he comes after wandering around for a bit, he sits down and starts a huge fight over why I jumped on Sam about being the phone. I'm like well I get a phone once in a while, and if it was for her I would have told you. No one told you it had to be her, and you had to invade my phone call. And he went on and on about I should use my cell phone, and well in order to use my cell phone it has to be on the speaker phone, so I get less privacy than I would on the house phone. He keeps yelling cause I ""jumped"" all over sam. WELL, IM NOT THE FUCKING ONE THAT INSISTED IT WAS HER MOM AND FOR HER TO GET ON THE PHONE, NOW AM I? ROAR!! Mom understood, and told him just to go to bed, he didn't. Ya know I really hate about him, is he thinks hes always fucking right, and throws a fit about me when I think I'm right and try to tell him hes wrong cause ya know hes never wrong. Mom has this problem too. Ya know if he it was her mom I would have told her, don't know why he had to think it was. Ya think he just coulda stayed outta it?!"

"event","So everyone I had a dream last night. It really scared me personally, and I've spend all day interputing it. I've come up with a meaning, but I'm not entirely sure it's the right one, I think I'm missing something. Don't know what though, so let me know if you have a different interputation of it. I'd be really glad to hear it, and thankful for your input. 

<lj-cut text=""My Dream""> 

I went to work, only I worked at a shopping center / pool area. A friend of mine from Wendy's worked there, her names Jen. When at work we liked to hang out a lot, so thats what we were doing. Only some how it jumps ( I don't know how) to her being a prostitute, and already helping some guy out in the pool. I couldn't believe it, but she urged me on to join her, as he had a friend and he need a prostitute too. So I jumped it, and became one to. I had a condem, I opened it and put it on him and off we were in the pool. I didn't actually see any of the uhh sex part, it skipped to being in the shopping center just walking around. Now I'm a full prostitute only its at work too, wierd. A bunch of big shots come in, that need prostitutes, and  only center people will do. When I'm picked to do it, I jump for joy and celebrate. I get in the pool and we do it again. Again I see no sex, not even the condem this time. It again jumps to me walking around in the shopping center. I run in the Jen yet again, and she said she'd be in the pool and someone was there waiting for me. (They had asked for me personally) So realizing I didn't have a condem with me, tell my manager I'm leaving for a minute and will be right back. I go to find a cvs or something for one, but I find I'm just in my neighborhood (weird, cause I'm in South Carolina presently) I run around the block searching for a store or someone to ask and I come across a bunch of guys and ask for one. Reassuring they do, and don't mind just giving it to me. I rush back to the pool and come across that the guy wanting me was in fact my ex-boyfriend. (Jesse) I'm shocked and just kinda stand there staring him. He looks at me and says I'm not here for me, I want help for my nephew (some pre-teen kid.) He goes on to say that he wanted to help him but didn't want just anyone, but thought I'd be best. So I say ok, and get him in the pool so that I could uhh ""help him"" Before I even finish getting the condem out of the package, the kid starts freaking out. I'm stunned don't know whats going on. The kid is screaming not to touch his ass, and no ones around and I've got both hands on the condem package. He screams again and jumps out of the pool, with something like a dildo sticking out of his ass. I'm shocked, I look up at Jesse and find that he had done it, and had already been out of the pool. They walk away together, after Jesse gives me a look of disappoint and disgrace. I'm left there shocked and what happened, and soon to be crying. Everyone around me staring, thinking I had hurt that boy, I knew that Jesse had killed my career and my life. I don't know what to do, he had adverently sabotted (sp) me, even Jen wanted notihng to do with me.

Don't try to explain a whole bunchs of stuff to me, that i already know its very annoying. trust me if your my peer or someone i know kinda well ill tell you. don't try ill let you know its annoying and not to do it. but whne older people do it, tryign to feel like your 12 or sometime. it just pisses me off."

Then we decided to wonder around Meijer for a while, was fun. Now its about 1:30- 2 am in the morning. We took his car, so we decided it was late and went back to get mine so we all could go home. Only thing was mine was left in a private beach area, where is got locked in. So now im stuck no car, its stuck, unsafe..quite worried about it lol. Chris had to give me a ride home, and get me in the morning so I can get my car. lol, can't believe they just locked my car in, and oh what inconsiderate bastards."

"event","So yes, quite pissed off, but im sure you would be too. I just got done with like a half hour bike ride with my neice that should have taken maybe 10min. love the fact that when we finally got home, no one really noticed we were even gone, and the fact that my dad knows how long it should take and knows whne to come looking and stuff like that. but im kinda glad they didn't, sam wasn't listening at all. this is why im NEVER having kids ppl. i can't stand them for more than a couple hours, im not a kid person at all. i want to live in teh city with a husband and a nice career, and live quite contently that way. roar! all the words that want to come out of my mouth are swear words like no other, got in a fight with sam because she wouldn't cross the road when i said and stupid stuff like that, then she decided to scream and cry she wanted to go home like that would really make a difference. i don't know about you but i spent all day with 2 kids and everything was fine, and stuff. then sam got here, and all ive heard is whining and complaining. so for about 20 min. we fought over how mean and crabby she was, and how immature and childish she was being compared to how she normally acts. btw hwen in an arguement with me, don't bother repeating stupid silly stuff over and over, like im sorry, or i was trying it has very little effect. just a note to all of you. got home and they started yelling they wanted to go to meijer well i personally pefer the new one because its closer, and a lot nice and cleaner. but no its father away and blah blah blah. so i said i wasn't going, and they threw a fit. oh well, and al has really been PISSING me off all fucking day, trying to agaiate me, and with certian ppl i just don't want to be touched, and he is one of them. it just pisses me off if he comes within like 2 feet of me, i hate it. lindsey and mom are the same way i just hate it. prolly cause i hate them, go figure. mostly ne one else, im fine with. 
oh that reminds me got in a fight with lindsey she was doing exactly the same thing, being stupid over some stupid cheerleading thing. complaining over stupid stuff, which i explained she was being stupid about, and never should be complaining about casue thats life, and how thigns work, and she had to fight and argue with me about saying i was wrong. well i sure hope i know more about life than she does cause im only 4 years older than her, i ahve a little more experience, and being gay doens't help the matter with experience, just showed. how ppl can change depending on stupid stuff that should matter and all become a two faced ass hole, and then its funny they say im stupid because um not friends with them. lol i like that part the most. ROAR is all i have to really say today."

   Still single, not really worried about it. Kinda like it, I don't want someone always there jugding my every move. Gotta go babysit, should be fun. Not.
There is nothing we can do, nope nothing. Sit around the house like a much of bums, honestly. How boring is that, I'm a horrible babysitter. I have to the most boring babysitter, ever. Not to meantion most kids seem to notice some aura  around me (least thats what i think it is) and have a tendency to stare at me, or just hate me in particular. Oh well, suppose thats fine with me, cause I never want any munchkins.
    So Dad was talking to Jon about what I had planned to do for college and stuff like that. I meantioned wanting to be an enturepeanuer (sp) and he was like uhh whats that? I laughed it's just a fancy way of saying you own your own business. Then like always they chime in how business fail in the first 5 years. Well I want to open a resturant, and they typically fail within the first year, let alone 5 years. Also he seems to think I'm a full straight A student, which I'm definitly not. I hate my classes, they are so fucking boring. Honestly, your luck I do my homework and go to school with the classes I always get stuck with it seems. Well babysittin time, ttul"

they are morons honestly. i hate the people that work there, i was very afraid of this 
that when i left wendys i would be screwed over cause my new job sucks and i left soemthing that was really good. for something that just sucks. so i like the job i  just really hate the workers there. im hoping soon that i wouldn't really be the new one for the realy young one. some of them talk to me like im hugely young, which i really am but im not really used to being talked to like that. even teachers don't talk to me that way, let alone everyone else im around and suddenly all of theres peple think they can talk to me like that, and not t o meaniton is really pisses me off. ne wayuys just htough i'd let you know of my frustrations. so umm, not to much going on. so i think ive officially scared off everyone i don't really wanna be friends with or around, im sorry i just don't get along with a lot of people there are just way too many  people that just push wrong buttons. i don't mind that people don't get along or really like me all that much because i quite like teh small group of friends i have. and just because your not in this small group doesn't mean i don't have any friends. unlike you all i don't base my self worth on my gender, sexuality or popularity. i have dreams,  and really gonna go far in life, and only way to do that is going to be by yourself. so umm yeah..just thought i'd give ya'll my views..not that anyone should care too much."

You have a lot of close<br>friends who you are very protective over, and<br>with your temper probably some enemies too. You<br>are not Miss Popular in school since you are<br>your own person and don't want to be forced<br>into behaving this or that way. You are the<br>untamed wild horse, the kind that everyone<br>wants to catch. But you don't want to be tied<br>down for the moment and just keep going with<br>your little crushes. Your will is strong and if<br>you set your mind to do something, you will<br>most likely succeed. But beware, your friends<br>may not always accept your mood-swinging<br>behaviour. Even if you don't mean to be mean,<br>they can still feel hurt. You just need to<br>start thinking some things through before you<br>do them, and not always jump in with so much<br>courage. One day you may be hurt because of<br>that, but then again, your element isn't fire<br>if you start to analyse situations before you<br>act.

"event","you know what ive noticed the world is a very simple place. its basically as i see it ne ways. you dream of what you want, work to get it, and your done. you now have what you wanted and should be a little happier, at least i would hope so. so why are they're so many unhappy poeple on the earth? so many are doing what they love for their jobs or going out and doing what hey know they love for a hobby at least. 
someone told me yesterday that they wished they were not gay, because it made life so much harder. well i don't really understand her concept but whatever works. i see it as if you don't want to be that way, then don't be. if you are unhappy doing something then why are you diong it? it doesn't make sense to me how people every day go to work and do something they hate. sure you may get paid a lot of money for it, but most jobs that do are either very dangerous or very time-consuming. so its not like you are ever really going to enjoy the money you mkae are you? for those taht save save save wahts the point if all yoru going to do is save, come on spend a little on yourself. have enough for a rainy day and enjoy life some. 

it seems like the world is all about society, and money. no on seems to care how happy they are, as long as they are popular or rich or something stupid of those lines. if you hate the drama of being in a bad relatinoship, why are you still in that relationship? get out, move on it life. please. and please if you are in a relationship or problem like that quit complaining cuase you must like it as your still doing it. you don't like your job, quit get a new one, i personally i realize i complain i need a new job i do only for experience points but im not quite willing to trade that for some of the people i work with, i mainly just want more money, lol. i love what i do, i love going to work on most days and the ones i don't i trade for the ones i do love."

in Nature. Down to earth, laid back and a natural<br>beauty. You have no need for
make-up or accessories that most others do. In fact<br>you most likely find them a
nuisance. You are probably a little tom-boyish in<br>your jeans and tees with a
great love for nature. You probably know more about<br>plants and animals than most
people and you'd rather spend your times outdoors<br>and in the sun, independent
and free. You can be a bit distant with people,<br>preferring the company of
animals over people, which isn't always the best<br>thing. You can be kind and
sweet, but not many see that side of you as you<br>often have misunderstandings
with people. You are very go-with-the-flow sort of<br>person and usually try to
avoid fights even if it means changing your opinion<br>or belief. Still, you are
you look your best actually without make-up and in<br>casual clothes. Very few can
say that. Be proud.</p>

only please everyone give people a chance to succeed in life before shoving them down. these people are people two and it hurts them when they try and you give them only an attuide becuase it wasn't good enough for you. take what they've given ya and be happy that their trying so hard to please you in the first place at all.

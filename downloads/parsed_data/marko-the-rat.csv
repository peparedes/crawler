"event","ABC News interviewed them <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-31/gorr-the-doug-anthony-all-stars/7286996"">about their come back</a> (fitting because they started on the ABC in the 90s). I got goosebumps when they started singing. But their songs have always been politically charged and this ""we're back!"" song was no exception. One line particularly struck me:<blockquote>A pensioner, a cripple, and a human being!</blockquote>Paul McDermott was singing and referring to the trio, with himself as the ""human being"". I thought it was a very revealing line about how we see people and label them. Tim (""Flacco"") Livingston is a shoe in, but a well known comedian from the 90s in his own right and a long time collaborator so he fits right in. Presumably he used to be a pensioner (and I'm sure to some people's minds you never stop being one). Tim Ferguson is the ""cripple"". He is now confined to a wheelchair because of multiple sclerosis. Only Paul, even though he's being hampered by his grey hair, still makes the grade as a human being.

Like me, they're older now (duh!) and not afraid to face up to it in their show. I want to go see them when they tour Brisbane!"

"event","RivFur, having been downgraded back to a furry meet, was a laid back affair this year, but I still managed to have fun at the BBQ and the closing ceremonies (where Rattus participated in a drawing game). The BBQ was special, because I used it to celebrate Rattus's 10th birthday. Hopefully I'll have photos to show you from that down the track, but for now I am pleased to showcase these photos from the BBQ:

"event","Neil Gaiman is a writer of excellent and discriminating taste. He likes rats. Most of his books have at least one rat in them. I am presently reading his latest collection of short stories, &quot;Trigger Warnings&quot;. I haven&#39;t encountered any rats yet, but I fully expect I will. Which brings me to this image. I won it in the art auction at Further Confusion 2007. I just had to get it because I am a rat that loves kangaroos. I asked the artist, G T Skunkrat, for the story behind this piece and he said there wasn&#39;t any. It&#39;s a fine piece, but that&#39;s where he fell down, according to Neil Gaiman, who had this choice piece of advice for artists:&nbsp;&quot;Be amiable but enigmatic, and when people ask for the story behind the painting, say, &quot;My lips are sealed.&quot; But for god&#39;s sake, imply there <i>is</i> one. It&#39;s the story they&#39;re buying.&quot;&nbsp;Of course, I&#39;d already bought it by then so it didn&#39;t matter, and I still have it celebrate my longstanding love of kangaroos.

"event","I thought this being the start of the Lunar New Year, this might be apposite. I mentioned on G+ that I didn't do anything special for the last Year of the Rat, but that's not really true. At Further Confusion 2008 I had the most singular honour of heading up the fursuit parade. Madius had organised a banner celebrating the Year of the Rat which was due to start soon and was very topical for FC that year, whose theme was the Fur East. It seemed the FC parade organisers agreed. I had humbly agreed to take one end of the banner and soon after the parade organisers caught wind of the plan and called for us to come to the front of the parade. I would not have given up my half of the banner for anything at that point! I often say I am proud to be a rat, but I don't think I have ever been prouder than I was on that day. I don't know what I will do for 2020, but it is hard to think how I will top that.

Congratulations to sheep and goats, and to all the animals of the Zodiac. There are only 12 of us, so we are all very special. (With a special nod to cats, who only narrowly missed out.)

"event","I tried out Google Radio on their 30 day free trial and found I really like it, but I also came to realise I can't afford to spend $12 a month on a luxury. I looked at the alternatives and decided to try out Pandora. Somebody had already registered an account on it using my email address, but it turns out it was easy to take it back by changing the password. It looks like whoever they were had abandoned the account some months ago anyway. At least their musical taste wasn't limited to the top 40. So if somebody called kangaroos06 had previously insulted you on Pandora, please be assured the rebranded Marko Rat is not like that. ;)

I am pretty pleased with Pandora so far. Its ability to pick musical sounds based on a band seems pretty good. I accept the price of a ""free"" service is advertising, but so far there hasn't been much. There seems to be no advertising when listening to music on the web interface and I've only heard one advert in the audio stream. There seems to be a lot of advertising on the Android app, but that will mostly be in the car when I can't look at it."

"event","@WhitePaw80 (on Twitter) asked: what draws you to being a rat? That question is far too involved to answer in 140 characters, so I will make a brave (foolhardy? vain?) attempt at doing so here.

Even though I'll be lampooned for it by the ""new"" furries, I truly believe the rat chose me, not the other way around. The more I reflect on it, the more honoured I feel by that choice. (For full disclosure, I should admit that <i>Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH</i> and <i>Roland Rat</i> were very big with me during my formative years, but that could just be the chicken and egg debate in fur.) It makes perfect sense: Who would want to be a rat? Rats are small, insignificant and reviled by Western culture. A rat acquaintance told me he was attracted to rats by their status as an iconoclast, but I don't think I ever sought out controversy intentionally. As far back as I can remember, long before I discovered the furry fandom (and, yes, probably even before <i>NIMH</i> and <i>Roland Rat</i>) I was attracted to rats. I thought they were cute (in spite of Western conditioning) and admired them for their intelligence and belligerent determination to live (here I owe a debt to a Christian TV preacher, one of my earliest memories relating to rats, who told the story of the family who tried to kill a rat that just wouldn't die). Which brings me to another early influence when it comes to rats: My father. He taught me to respect rats. He made a humane live rat trap, and I saw a rat escape from it once, by squeezing through a hole the size of its head. It gave me the willies at the time, but it showed me how determined rats are to live. He also told me a story (which I strongly suspect to be apocryphal) of how rats steal chicken eggs: One lies on its back and holds the egg with all four legs while the other drags his friend by the tail.

So the short answer is that I don't know. I could have just said that, but I wanted to be more honest than that, and to also lay out the early influences as I saw them."

<lj-cut text=""Read about my ratty adventures here..."">
Must I start by saying it was the best Mardi Gras ever? Of course it was, but that goes without saying. Dustan and Loupy had a bold vision for the float and they executed it beautifully. I think this was the best attended Mardi Gras furry float yet (which does mean it&#39;s getting a bit crowded on the truck). Off loading administration onto the (very capable) Jes&#39;ad was also a good idea. Their communication policy needs work but they know that.

But this post, as it always is, is about my personal Mardi Gras adventure. Not everything went right this year (does it ever?), which gives me an opportunity to reflect on what I can do better for next year, which will be Rattus&#39;s big one, the 10th anniversary of his first Mardi Gras (before he was even a full suit). He has gone every year since and I can&#39;t let him miss out. I got hooked on the high I got from doing it in Mardi Gras and every year I need a new fix.

The trip down to Sydney went smoothly. A girl kindly offered to help me haul my suitcase up the stairs of the (very wheelchair-unfriendly) Museum train station, but I politely declined. She looked like a druggie. I wanted to stay in the CBD this time to make transport to and from easier. It was a partial success. The Travelodge Sydney Stephen and I stayed in was quite well appointed for the price and in a prime location, being just down the road from Hyde Park, the starting point. However, after the march, it soon became obvious I would have been better served finding a room closer to the end point, near Fox Studios. Rattus&#39;s garbage bag shredded when I tried to carry him back. Another furry kindly loaned me a smaller garbage bag but I still had to carry the body suit draped over my shoulders. This meant a long walk with Rattus&#39;s body exposed to the rain and smokers, since much of our walk naturally mirrored the parade route. That was bad enough, but I had stupidly left my glasses case in a side pocket of my backpack, which meant it fell out when it got hauled onto the truck. We were hustled off the truck and out of the parade area too quickly for me to be able to find it. I was so grateful to have Stephen with me then, so he could navigate using my phone while I trudged close to him.

My glasses and Stephen&#39;s radio gear being left on the truck meant we were both compelled to attend the official after-parade party, where the truck went. I was undecided as to whether I wanted to go or not, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise having the decision made for us because not only did I retrieve my glasses but I got to catch up with lots of furries and enjoy the free booze. I swear, I only had a small amount of milk chocolate liqueur, a cider and a beer, but after being so worn out from the march, even that left me quite tipsy.

Another down side was that I ended up on the wrong side of the truck for the SBS 2 cameras and didn&#39;t appear in their coverage of the furry float. That&#39;s not important though, we only got 12 seconds and it looks like they didn&#39;t bother to read the considered responses we sent back to their questions. I do it for the cheering crowds and appearing on TV is only a bonus.
</lj-cut>

So huge love goes out to Dustan, Loupy and Jes&#39;ad for making and organising the best Mardi Gras yet!"

He looked behind him and saw that during the darkest patches of his life there was only one set of footprints in the sand. He asked Jesus where he was when he needed him most. Jesus replied, ""That was when I was carrying you."" Sadly, I don't have Jesus to carry me, but sometimes my friends will do the same for me. Thank you.

I know I am not at my best right now, and for that I can only beg pardon. Hopefully I will be back to normal again (a new normal?) but it will have to be in my own time."

There we were lucky enough to find someone still in the 'closed' Toyota dealership, who (sulkily) sold us the part we needed. David fitted and we headed off again but we still overheated on the way out so we limped back, resigned to spending the night. (Echoes of my roadtrip bringing Ristin up to Brisbane were not lost on me.) A kindly motel keeper loaned us a spanner and David was able to remove the thermostat. (Dud I say how good he us with cars?) Our overheating troubles were over and we were able to motor in to Forbes. Our adventures continue.

BTW, when in Gilgandra we yes and recommend the Orona Windmill Motor Inn, just around the corner from the Toyota."

Such an exhibition for me would of course have Rattus as the centrepiece, but what if he could be more than that? What if he could be a participant too? I would love for Rattus to be sitting there among my much-loved plush, but then he could surprise people by actually having someone inside! Rattus is a simple creature; he has no regrets for the past or fears for the future--he lives only in the now. He would help to make the funeral what it should be: a celebration of my life. And it would firmly show where I stand on the debate about what should happen to a dead furry&#39;s fursuit. :)

Of course, I would neither know nor care. You could dump me in the tip and say good riddance to bad rubbish. But I hope there will be something better than that for my fursuits and most beloved plush."

"event","No, you still can't vote online in Australia (or any other democracy to the best of my knowledge--there are serious identity issues that would need to be overcome first), but at least I've worked out how to make it easier to number below the line on the unwieldy Senate ballot paper. I'm a big fan of numbering below the line because I'm not happy with any party's preference allocations and it's due to back-room preference deals by the major parties that we get anomalous results like Family First winning a Senate seat in Victoria on 1.8% of the primary vote. The problem is, Senate ballot papers are becoming harder to number below the line. For example, Queensland has 82 candidates and 36 groups. Most people don't do it because it's so hard, and so easy to get it wrong and invalidate your vote. What we really need is voting reform where we can number the groups above the line and just have that count as allocating our preferences in order down the group, but that will be a long time coming. In the meantime, you can get a spreadsheet program to help you get it right, but be warned this is not for the faint of heart. If you're unsure, you're better off just numbering ""1"" above the line in the box corresponding to your preferred party so you don't waste your vote.

EDIT: <a href=""http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2013/08/voting-below-the-line-in-the-senate.html#more"">Antony Green provides some useful websites for automating this process</a> and points out that you only have to 90% of the squares and still be valid. You can also put a ""1"" above the line as insurance in case you get your below the line voting wrong.)

<lj-cut text=""Click here for instructions...""><ol>
<li>You start by going to <a href=""http://www.aec.gov.au/election/downloads.htm"">this page on the Australian Electoral Commission website</a> and scrolling down to Senate Group Voting Tickets and downloading the CSV file for your State or Territory. 

<li>Open it in your preferred spreadsheet program. Unfortunately, it runs all the voting tickets for the parties together, so you have to find the party who's voting ticket most closely matches your voting intentions. (If one does match your intentions closely enough, then why are you doing this? Just put a ""1"" above the line in the box corresponding to your party.) <a href=""http://www.aec.gov.au/election/who-are-the-candidates.htm"">This page</a> will help you--click on the Senate candidates listing for your State or Territory and then click the link entitled ""Group Voting Tickets"". This will show you the letter associated with your preferred party's ticket which you can then search for in your CSV file.

<li>Copy <i>all</i> of your party's group voting tickets (ie, all of your party's letter in column B) and paste into a new sheet. (This won't work if your party is doing a split voting ticket, which has always struck me as indicative of a lack of ticker. You will need to filter out the non-preferred ticket by number, which is listed in column C.)

<li>Sort the list in ascending order according to column G (preference allocation). Make a note of the highest number in this column because it will tell you how many candidates you have running in your State or Territory--in Queensland it's 82.

<li>Now just shuffle the parties around in the order you prefer. (The reason I suggest you start with your preferred party's voting ticket rather than the first cab off the rank is so hopefully you won't have to do as much shuffling.)

<li>When you've got the parties (or you can do it right down at the candidate level if you prefer) in the order you want to vote for them, clear column G and start it off with 1, 2, 3 in the first three rows. Select these numbers and then drag a corner of your selection down to the end of the group voting ticket. If you have a spreadsheet program worth its salt, it will auto-populate that column in ascending order from 1 to the number of candidates running in your State or Territory. You will know you've done it right without having accidentally deleted or inserted rows when the final number agrees with the number you made a note of earlier in step 4.

<li>Print out columns D to G or save them to your preferred mobile device and then transcribe the numbers in your list to the official ballot paper when you're in the voting booth. Bonus points if you can think of an easy way to sort it back in its original order which will reflect the order on your ballot paper, making it easier to transcribe.

I still haven't decided where I want to room for it though. I know I said Confurgence is my next stop, but I really hope it won't be so! Now that I'm expecting to see the warg at the Burleigh Heads Fur Meet at the end of August I really want Rattus there for a photo op. I missed him at BunFur and now RivFur. I will stalk that warg across the country if I have to! I am also giving FurJam in Sydney (early September) some funny looks."

Sorry for all the furry affectations in a work post; I am also on my way to RivFur so my head is in two places right now.

Wow! Over two years since my last update. No wonder it took me a while to remember how to update it all and to repair the shell scripts that help to automate the process. But is it worth it? Updating Roophilia seems so clunky in the age of web 2.0, and its design does not fit the higher resolution photos I want to upload nowadays. Also, Roophilia does not get anything like the attention it did in the old days. I suppose I could make a Roophilia page on FaceBook and pimp for ""likes"" for it and either upload photos there (thus leaving behind my friends on LJ) or maybe devote a page on Flickr to it and notify my followers of updates in the usual manner (it would take me a while to fill 1TB). Either way, I would be effectively relinquishing possession of my photos (which is why I've been reluctant up till now) and any photos of a reproductive nature (or even too gory, as <a href=""http://www.furry.org.au/kangaroos/tasphilia/eating01.jpg"">one photo</a> arguably could be) would still have to go to the old site (which would stay up indefinitely as long as Bang keeps <a href=""http://www.furry.org.au"">furry.org.au</a> going. Thoughts, anyone?"

"event","While I was out in the city attending to errands, I had cause to muse on just how far we have progressed with the internet. I first discovered the internet when I was an IT uni student in the early 1990s, probably a little over 20 years ago now. (I expect they only let IT students have access to the internet back then.) I would access it either on dumb terms from uni or via a 14.4K modem from home. (Before then, I would mess around on BBSs on even slower analogue modems.) It was through the internet that I would discover the furry fandom (much like furries do now). But back then I would mostly use it to lurk on newsgroups (my younger readers would not be familiar with those--similar to web forums), to download naughty pictures of astonishingly low resolution (by modern standards) and to read fan fiction (<a href=""http://pendorwright.com/journals/"">Elf Sternberg's Journal Entries</a> were my favourite). It was some years later before it would occur to me I could make my own <a href=""http://www.furry.org.au/haal/plush/"">websites</a> and try my hand at playing MP3s and other music files and had a computer up to the job.

Now, while I was in the city, I was able to check my route on Google Maps and keep up with responses to the silly tweet I made earlier that day while planning a rendezvous with a friend. If I'd been so inclined, I would have thought nothing of plugging in some headphones and listening to some music. All of this would have been unthinkable 20 years ago. The internet was something you used (slowly!) on your desktop. Mobile phones were bricks and the cause of some rubber necking when I saw my first one in the wild. Nowadays, we bitch when our mobile connectivity drops out for a few minutes.

I'm not sure what we're going to take for granted 20 years from now, but I look forward to finding out."

I was determined not to let being unemployed make me miss  it; I have been every year since 2005 (even in 2011, when there was no furry float) and I'm superstitious about missing a year now. It was just as well, as this was the biggest (ie, most fursuiters and other attendees) and best one so far.

My trip had a rocky start, with my flight down to Sydney being cancelled. After a panicked phone call I was put on a flight the following morning, still in time for Mardi Gras and I even scored a $100 travel voucher for it (in fact, I got two for some reason, making me seriously consider a trip down to Melbourne). <lj user=""temba"" /> picked me up from the airport and was a wonderful host as always, along with his housemates Packer and Mindfyer. I got my usual case of butterflies, but I've done it so many times now I'm not really all that nervous anymore. I took a train down with Moreth (who went dressed as <a href=""https://plus.google.com/photos/110978269106056674656/albums/5851661378052502417/5851661384210030930?banner=pwa"">Princess Peach</a> for the gaymers' float). It was a much more pleasant wait this time as we only had to deal with a few showers this time. I also remembered to wear my undersuit under my regular clothes, making changing into Rattus much easier. Because the weather was kinder and I hadn't injured myself on the way this time, I was able to explore some of the other floats, the results of which you can see in <a href=""https://plus.google.com/photos/110978269106056674656/albums/5851661378052502417"">my photo album</a>. The march itself was great fun as always. My only regret is that I should have taken this opportunity to do it on foot this year. The weather was good for it and I'm sure I would have been up to it physically, though I expect I would have flagged towards the end. I'm in awe of the energy Stripe Husky put into marching on foot this year.

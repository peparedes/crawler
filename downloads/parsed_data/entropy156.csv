"event","I have a phone interview for a job tomorrow morning and, tonight I've been doing some prep work for it.  The company and the position have a certain amount of overlap with both of my last two jobs, and in the course of reviewing their activities in the power generation industry, it occurred to me that I haven't checked on the progress of the big project I was working on before I got laid off.  The project was working on the Application for Certification for a 250 MW solar-thermal powerplant to be built in the California desert near Hinkely.  That Application is a major undertaking and, in it's printed form, comprises three volumes and many, many thousands of pages of reports and summaries...some of which I had a hand (sometimes a major hand) in writing.  The Application was due to be filed with the California Energy Commission the week after I was laid off, but actually didn't get in until the middle of last month, according to the CEC website.  Tonight, I visited that website for the first time since I was laid off from the company, and the project because I knew that , by now, the project should be filed and the CEC process underway.  I was counting on being able to look at that important public document with a kind of sad pride....pride for the work I did, sad because I didn't get to see it all the way through to completion.

I am stunned at what I found.

As it turns out, either my former employer, or the company who contracted him has removed my name from everything I worked on.  I am nowhere to be found on the List of Contributors to the AFC.  A year's work and there is no proof whatsoever that I was even involved.  I am completely disappointed and, yes absolutely fucking furious about this.  This guy...my former employer...was a dear friend before he became my boss.  I would have done damn near anything for this guy.....and, apparently, this is my payment.

"event","In honor of Earth Day, I figured I'd show a brief except from what I did last Sunday.  The video shows about half of the Ford Pinto club (of which I'm a member) leaving breakfast at Carrow's restaurant on the way to the very first car show I've ever done as a participant.  The weather was absolute blast-furnace hellishness but I got to meet some spiffy people and see some amazing machinery.  Our club (36 Pintos strong at this event) was parked in the order you see the cars coming out of the lot in the video...(you can see...and more importantly, hear my car at 1:24, by the way) which meant that my rough, dented little street fighter was sitting right next to about $60,000 worth of gorgeous, horrifyingly fast and slick pro-street 1971 sedan (the even <i>louder</i> car which follows me out of the lot).  Interestingly, my car managed to gather almost as many admirers as the big bucks, big tire car...which was both surprising and gratifying.  Anyway, enjoy the parade...there's a few really neat ones in it:

"event","Congratulations, America.  You've handed the country over to a slick lawyer with no executive experience, a deliberately obscured voting record (present!), a briefcase filled with disasterous Carter Administration policies, a background filled with left wing extremists, terrorists, felons and racist preachers, and a running mate who's a gaffe machine who's been on the wrong side of every major foreign policy issue since the Nixon Administration.  You've substituted bumper sticker slogans like Hope and Change for content and drank dry the kool-aide tubs. 

I expect this Manchurian Candidate you've elected to fly the country into the ground hard, and when he does, I intend to be right there to shout ""I told you so"".  According to Joe ""I suspect my I.Q. is much higher than yours"" Biden, that should happen within 6 months of the inauguration...and he should know, right?

To take up the time until that happens, I'm going to need a hobby...and since your new president is probably going to try to disarm me, depriving me of one of my current ones, I've decided to take up attacking the Obama Administration...and I'm not going to be nice about it, like I was here.  Nope...I'm going to do it with the same kind of focus as you guys have for the last 8 years...and I'm going to enjoy it.

To that end, this will be my last political post on this journal.  I'm returning this one to it's original intended purpose and moving my considerable fury to my new second home at <lj user=newcruelty>.  I invite you to add me over there....or don't.

Oh...and Bob Barr for President.

However, if you live in a hotly contested state, I recommend McCain...who I don't like, but who has the absolutely glorious quality of being not Obama.  You see, I for one, have not forgotten that McCain was considered as a Vice Presidential candidate in 2004.  For the John Kerry campaign.  Look it up, O-bots...

I scramble home from work, set up the fog machines, set up the lighting effects, grab some scary props and wait for the kids.  Little kids get no scariness, and handfuls of candy.  The older ones...say 13 and up.....they get the sideshow.   They get the sound of tempered steel blades scraping against each other in the fog and ringing in that way that only a bigass blade can do.  They get the distinctive sound of a small two stroke engine being pull-started, catching, stumbling and turning off, only to hear me pull the rope again as visions of whirling steel teeth and meathooks in Texas farmhouses dance in their heads.  They get a dark, crouching figure in the shadows....in the fog....laughing.  And for the ones who keep walking toward that door despite all the sounds, they get big honkin' fistfuls of candy....but usually they run like their ass is on fire the second I move and I chase them down shouting offers of candy.  Once they stop, we all have a good laugh.

Last time I did this, a kid that looked to be about 14 ran so fast he left both his shoes behind on the lawn.

"event","This video contains excerpts from a radio interview with the Obamassiah in 2001, in which he bemoans the Warren Supreme Court for ""failing"" to redistribute wealth.<br>
<lj-embed id=""8""/> <br>
I think the absolutely most chilling thing said by the <i>clearly</i> Marxist candidate for the Democrat Party is that the Warren Court, ""...didn't break free from the essential constraints that were placed by the founding fathers in the Constitution.""<br>
<br>Excuse me?<br><br>
Apparently the junior Senator from Illinois seems to think that the Constitution of the United States of America is something which must be gotten around.  That it is necessary and desireable to ""break free"" from it's ""constraints"".  He later goes on to explain that he doesn't think it's too late to do that but that the way to do it is through the Legislative Branch rather than the Judicial.  
You will note that it is <i>assumed</i>, in the context of his conversation, that the idea of the government using the threat of force to steal wealth and property from those who have created or earned it so that can be redistributed to those who have done neither is the right thing to do; that the Marxist redistribution of wealth is a Good Thing and that the only real question is how best to accomplish it.<br>If you are the kind of person who loves their Constitutional rights, the prospect of this man holding the office of President of the United States should scare the living shit out of you.  If the O-bots get their way, I would recommend finding yourself an appropriate handbasket..."

"event","Several of my LJ debate opponents recently have implied that I seem to exist only to tear people and their arguments to bloody chunks and that I offer no solutions; that the name Entropy is well suited to me because I'm only here to destroy.  They say that they know what I'm against and what I hate, but not what I'm for.  So I've decided to throw a little bit out there of what I believe, in order to show both where I'm coming from and where I'm going.  Now, I'm a bit tired and scattered right now...so hopefully this will make sense.

I believe that we live in a world where we spend a good deal of our time doing things we don't want to do.  As the saying goes, ""If work were meant to be fun, they'd have called it fun...but they didn't call it ""fun"", they called it <i>work</i>.""  Time, you see, is the most finite and precious resource we have.  You are born with a set and indeterminate amount of it, and that's all.  There's no rebuy, to steal a word from the poker world.  When you die, you can't negotiate for more time.  That's it...end of the line...cash your chips and get out. Like Oliver Twist, you can't have more. Because time....your lifespan...is limited, it is also valuable in a way that nothing else can be.  It is the ultimate standard of value.  Think I'm wrong?  Talk to someone who's young and dying.

If you'd like to stay alive in this world...and who among us doesn't...you're going to have to pay.  You need to eat, you need to drink, you need shelter....not to mention the things which you want, and which will make your life more pleasurable.  For you to have those things, you (or somebody else in your stead) must trade something of value...and the only thing that you've got is what you were born with: Time.

When you work for someone, you are making an agreement that you are willingly trading some of your limited time on this planet...your life force, if you will...for something else of value, usually money.  The more of your time you expend, the more money you will earn.  You are trading value for value by your own free will.  Now, it might be argued that you're getting the short end of the deal as you're trading something far more valuable than money (Again...ask the dying) but let's reject that, for the sake of this discussion.  Because you've entered into this agreement of your own free will by taking the job, you are agreeing to the value being set on your time.  You agree to come to a specified place during specified business hours and do what is required of you, rather than, say, stay at home and sleep in.  Your presence at work carries the opportunity cost of not being able to do something else with that time...perhaps even something you'd rather be doing, were all things equal. Eventually, you will be paid for your work.  That payment equals the value of that part of your life you've given up.  

That money represents your precious and limited time, your life force, rendered into a form which can be traded.  When you buy something, you've just assigned it a value based on how much of your life you'd trade to possess it.  

Money equals your time..which equals your life force expended in pursuit of it.

Kinda' scary, huh?

Now, when a government (which is, essentially, an organization or body with a monopoly on initiating force on it's people) collects taxes, it is doing so under threat of violence.  All taxes are collected by pointing a gun at you.  If you don't pay them, then agents with guns will eventually come for you and deprive you of your freedom.  If you resist or escape, you stand a good chance of being killed.  In collecting taxes, that government is robbing you.  Think it's voluntary?  Try saying no.  Then say hi to Wesley Snipes in prison for me.  That money which is collected in taxes represents the amount of your life and your life force you've expended to get it.  Taxes are vampirism...and not in a sexy, Anne Rice kinda' way.  Tax collection is an armed man stealing part of your life in order to give it away to others. 

 This means we'd better make damn sure that the things we spend taxpayer money on are important enough to justify this theft of property, of value, of life itself.  We have an absolute moral obligation to be sure this is the case.

Because I believe these things, I have seriously negative reactions to any politician or political party which decides it has a right to help itself to the fruits of my labor...or *anybody's* labor....I'm talking to you, Democrats, and especially you, Obama.  I don't object to people with wealth.  I consider them a good example and an inspiration...they got there, and in this country, perhaps I can too.  When I hear Joe Biden claim that paying higher taxes is ""patriotic"" I want to reach down his throat and pull his spine out his mouth....metaphorically, of course.  How dares this fucking weasel to equate theft with patriotism?  The top 20% of income earners pay some 80% of the taxes in this country and the bottom 40% pays nothing at all. Am I in that 20%?  No.  Not by a long shot, but wrong is wrong.  Who are we...who is Obama to decide that that 20% must sacrifice <i>more</i> for ""the good of all"" with his proposed tax hike on the ""wealthiest Americans""? What percentage is ""enough""?  At what point have they paid ""their fair share"" as the Democrats love to say?  How much wealth should we confiscate from those who have worked to create it and, in doing so, made this country better and stronger?  How much of their life force do we as a society get to lay claim to?  How much do we get to loot from them?  How much do we get to bleed them before we've had enough?

 I'm an Objectivist.  I agree with Ayn Rand when she said, ""America's abundance was created not by public sacrifices to the common good, but by the productive genius of free men who pursued their own personal interests and the making of their own private fortunes. They did not starve the people to pay for America's industrialization. They gave the people better jobs, higher wages, and cheaper goods with every new machine they invented, with every scientific discovery or technological advance- and thus the whole country was moving forward and profiting, not suffering, every step of the way.""  When you redistribute the wealth by stealing it at gunpoint from the people who create wealth and jobs to give it to the people who...let's be nice and say ""don't do that"", what kind of prosperity are you creating?  You aren't.  You're creating disincentive for achievement and you are punishing success in order to curry favor with and ""buy"" votes from people who lack ambition and who want to turn J.F.K.'s famous question to us all into ""What can government give me?""  Your income tax credits for people who pay no taxes, your social programs, your ""free"" universal healthcare....none of that is free.  It's all paid for by money looted from others by government.  You may be ok with that, but I am not. Perhaps I'm just not enough of a pragmatist to call it anything but immoral.

So, no...I will not vote for Obama or his vile, plagiarizing bastard of a running mate.

I will not drink the Kool-Aide, I will not bend my knee, and I will not compromise my principles.  My money, my property, and my life are my own and I will not surrender them to looters willingly.

Well, when they aren't bullying financial institutions into making loans to people who can't afford them, raking off millions of tax dollars to build slum housing or even working with a terrorist to fail to improve education in Chicago public schools, they like to use their time to commit massive voter fraud and attempt to completely subvert the democratic process in the U.S. in order to install a socialist in the White House.

"event","Just to end the week on a bang, here's a little trip in the wayback machine to the 1988 presidential campaign of Joe Biden as he viciously berates one of his own supporters.  Listen carefully to the points he makes after the spectacularly arrogant comment about his I.Q. because we're going to revist them.<br>
<lj-embed id=""7""/> <br>

That's right...when he wasn't plagiarising other people's speeches during that failed campaign (and let me remind you at this juncture that he lost that primary election to Mike fucking Dukakis, perhaps the least charismatic candidate to run since...well....since Walter Mondale), Mr. Biden was absolutely lying his ass off about his academic qualifications and record.  To wit:<br>
<br>Biden claims that he was at the University on a full academic scholarship and that he was the only one.  The truth is that he was attending on a partial scholarship based on financial need.  Blatant lie number one.<br>
Biden claims that he graduated in the top half of his class from law school.  In actuality he graduated number 76th in his law class of 85.  Blatant lie number two....unless this is some kind of new math the Democrats invented to explain their tax plans.<br>
Biden claims that he graduated with three degrees.  In reality he did have a double major but that means he graduated with one....not three or two, but one degree.  Blatent lie number 3...and I'm starting to think I'm on to something here with this Democrat math...<br>
Biden claims that he won Outstanding Student in the Political Science department.  The reality is that he didn't. Pretty black and white.  He was nominated and lost.<br><br>
In summary, Joe Biden has a historical serious problem with truth.  He lied on this video, he got busted for plagiarism in law school when he stole 5 pages out of someone elses work to incorporate into his, he got busted for plagiarism on the campaign trail in 1988 which scuttled his campaign, and he seriously exaggerated when he claimed he was ""shot at"" in Iraq.  He wasn't. What he was is a lying douchebag.<br>
So step right up, you Obama-bots!  Punch that card knowing that <i>this</i> is the man you want to make one hearbeat away from running the free world..."

That's right....in a display of <i>true</i> leadership FDR went on television when the stock market crashed to reassure the American People. <br>
Except the stock market crash was in 1929.  FDR wasn't in office until 1933.<br>
Oh....and television?  The first American-made, commercial, mass-produced televisions didn't show up until 1938. 

Clearly, Biden is a real rocket surgeon...

"event","Yes...I've been slacking off on this whole blog thingie and figured I'd better post some updates before I get even more ridiculously behind.  First, and most importantly, I am employed again and have been for a little over a month.  The good news is it's for waaaay more money.  The better news is that it's a big honkin' challenge and a boss who's brilliant as well as a dear friend.  It's such a strange experience driving to work and not feeling loathing.  Anyway, it's an engineering company and I'm now a project manager....and what a project!  We're working with a company who's going to build the world's largest solar power plant.  And, yes, the irony of me working on something that is even the vaguest bit ""green"" is not lost on me.

Oh...and while I'm at it, check out what my friends and I did last weekend.  It was put together literally over the weekend in order to win a ""film a commercial for one of our products"" competition.  The commercial was directed and edited by the brilliant Jon Enge for Mars Rising Productions and written, crewed and acted by some of my fellow members of Cult of the Eye....and I did the music.  It can be seen here:  <br> <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgq-aBq_6UQ <br>
And supposedly there's a 2 1/2 minute ""director's cut"" in the works...   ;-)"

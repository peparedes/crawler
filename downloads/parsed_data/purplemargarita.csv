Honey why are you calling me so late
It's kinda hard to talk right now
Honey why are you crying is everything okay
I gotta whisper cause I can't be too loud
Well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And yes I've dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me
Will it start a fight
No I don't think she has a clue
Well my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye

i wish i could just figure out what i want. i can't keep going back and forth on where i'm going to college, among many other things. why the crap am i so wishy washy?? ahh! it bothers me. 

anyways, other than that, i go back to school tomorrow. stephanie got a car now so it will be weird not having her ride with me. this will be the first time she has driven her own car to school..it's like me and her have grown apart here lately. i know that it's just because we're becoming more like sisters than best friends but that is just a side effect of having someone live with you. it's not that great of one though! i miss her a lot sometimes but then again, i don't really know what to do about it. oh well...what are you gonna do right?"

This time, This place
Misused, Mistakes
Too long, Too late
Who was I to make you wait
Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know,
you know, you know

[CHORUS]
That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
and you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all
I'd give for us
Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know,
you know, you know

[CHORUS]

So far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know

I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I forgive you
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and, never let me go
Keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and, never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and, never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and, never let me go"

She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want

Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

"event","life can be a bitch sometimes...

take for example listening to your mom and her boyfriend having sex...pretty nasty stuff.


man i need to get some ear plugs or something...!


anyways, enough about that stuff nobody wants to hear about. things have been crappy but improving lately. stephanie lives with me now. we're more like sisters than best friends...we tell each other everything. it's hard not to do that though when you live somebody. we also fight like sisters though...but even if we do fight we know not to take the other person seriously. for instance, she knows not to mess with me when i first wake up and i know better than to try to wake her up and talk to her while she is sleeping. it's just the way we are. plus, i've got a new beautiful wardrobe to work with now. 
school is pretty gay. i like my classes this semester better, though. latin 4th block is much easier to handle than 1st block, and i love coach kirk for chemistry. ap european is much more interesting than world, too. 
things with shea are going as well as they can i guess. it's so hard to have a relationship with somebody when you know you can't see them to spend time with them. he has changed a lot since he's gone into the army and i have changed even more with him being away. we're just not the same people we used to be, and i'm just starting to realize how difficult it is gonna be for us to make our situation work. he was supposed to find out yesterday if he was going to korea for sure or not but he didn't say anything to me about it, and i'm afraid to ask. an army guy that came into applebee's told me that korea is just one big party and that even if he told me he loved me and even if he really does, things will probably happen over there that i would never find out about. i already know that he keeps a lot of stuff from me, but he is just a very sneaky person. i love him so much but sometimes i wonder if maybe there are two other people out there that are suited better for the personalities me and him have. we're just completely opposite people, and we don't share too many qualities. even when talking about where to live or where i wanna go to college or how i wanna get there we have different opinions. he is the type of guy that wants to provide everything for his girlfriend/wife and i'm more the type of person that likes to do things on my own. i always have. so i dunno. i guess that is why it has been so confusing lately. 
sometimes it just takes time for you to figure out what is supposed to happen and for right now i am just going with the flow. i wish he would stop pressuring me to make the committments i'm not ready for ... :/"

haha..sorry, but i'm a bit excited.

this is a list of things i have to do over this little break from school:
1. Read two Latin books.
2. Write a Latin story, and draw a comic strip to go with it.
3. Make up a butt-load of Pre-Cal homework.
4. Study for three tests in Lit.
5. Read 4 chapters of AP World History.
6. Study for AP World test. 

-and that's just the homework!

shea will be here until sunday and i'm supposed to fit that in during my break. not only is it thanksgiving but it's my birthday as well and from thursday night until saturday morning i will be in alabama. that means i'll have to work on all that crap down there. saturday night we're all gonna try to do something for my birthday...maybe a party at autumn's??? but i dunno, it depends on what autumn says. i wanna do something will all of my friends and shea's too while he is here though. i'm so excited!!

tomorrow i have cheerleading practice from 9 to 11...BOO. it sucks to sit and watch my team...but i am proud that they are so awesome. i know they will do great at state this year too....state champs two years in a row would be incredible.

this week has been kinda weird. monday didn't really feel like halloween but it was fun. i got to dress up for work again. tuesday wasn't that great...we were told that daemion's dad passed away and daemion took it really hard. i felt so bad for the poor little guy...mom checked him out of school and then after she told him the news he started crying hysterically and said he wanted me there so mom checked me out too. i missed practice and my coach was a bitch about it but i don't really care. when has she ever been loyal to me? and why should i have to justify missing practice for my little brother who wanted me there because his dad died??? i'm not even gonna think about it or talk about it anymore. anyways, today through the weekend i guess i will have the house to myself. it's kinda nice but it's lonely too ya know. i just wish shea was at home so he could come and stay with me:)

do yall think that's true?


tonight was the big halloween bash at applebee's. a bunch of my friends came to see me dressed up as a gypsie and it made me happy...thanks go out to nancy, samantha, autumn, heather, nick, jimmy, trammell, stephy, shelby, and abby for stopping by...i love yall! if i can figure out how to post pics on this thingie then i'll try to get some up. halloween is on monday and i get to dress up again...woo woo!

things have been stressful lately but i'm dealing. there is a lot to update about...mostly dealing with me and shea but i guess the main thing to say is that we got back together. last friday when i went to his graduation from basic training we talked about a lot of stuff, and have since discussed a lot of stuff, and i love him very much and i don't really see the point in me dating all these random people like i've been doing. i mean, i've had fun but when i think about how much i love shea and miss him it's almost like...what's the point? plus, i haven't been quite myself either when it comes to certain things. and besides, me and shea may be in a long distance relationship but if we can last through this then maybe he really is the person i'm supposed to end up with. you never know...:)

as for other stuff...cheerleading is crappy. i'm doing both right now b/c ann marie is hurt. i hate it so much and i'm not trying out for competition next year. if i cheer at all it will just be for football because that is easy and takes up less time. school is alrite but i haven't been caring much so i guess it's causing me to slack off. i need to care but i just don't. i keep telling myself i'm gonna care next week, i'm gonna care, i'm gonna try harder....but then i don't. so oh well...what's one to do? nothing i guess...

i miss and love everyone on here! i miss reading your journals and such...hopefully i'll have the internet for a decent amount of time this time.

i've thought about a lot of things over the past couple of months...i've come to a few very important realizations that i wouldn't have reached had shea not left for the army...also, i've thought about what i want to do in the future a good bit. it's crazy, i've been thinking even more than i usually do...and considering i over-analyze everything, all this extra thinking is really gonna drive me nuts. but hey, maybe i'll get some stuff figured out soon and then i won't have to worry about it.

anyways, i'm way too tired to be talking about this stuff right now."

"event","looks like i haven't updated in a while. this shouldn't take too long, though because i forget things a lot.

school started monday, and this seems like its gonna be a pretty good year. i've realized that this semester my classes are easier than next semester's. that kinda sucks but then again i won't have cheerleading next semester either so it will be easier to handle. oh yeah, about cheerleading. my foot has been hurting and swelling so badly lately that i haven't been able to do anything. really all i do is show up at practice, help spot the stunts, help coach the girls, and try to teach my part to this new girl named Kirsti. so yeah, i'm not gonna have a spot on jv or varsity but i don't know if i even care because my foot hurts that bad when i cheer. i just want it to stop hurting altogether. it's amazing how one moment can change your life so much. 
work has been going well but i know that it's gonna be hard to keep up with school, cheerleading, and work this year. i mean, i never got much sleep before anyways but now i'm really not gonna get any sleep at all. hopefully tonight and tomorrow night i'll get to go to bed earlier than i have been. i also have an essay due tomorrow that i need to do but you know me...a bit of a procrastinator.

today we had a junior class meeting. it's really hard to believe that i'm halfway through high school and i'm an upper classman now. i signed up for junior class office/prom committee too....which is very cool. 

marty just left my house...i'm glad i got to see him today but his mom would only let him stay an hour :( so we just hung out and he watched me eat a lot of food. haha. 

ahh, shea leaves for the army very soon. very soon as in like 4 days. i'm gonna go crazy when he leaves. i know i'll cry but i've been trying not to think about it all this week. it's just hard to believe that he won't be around here for when i want to call and talk to him and i won't see him in town anymore. he won't be around to get in trouble and i probably won't go to his house for a very very very long time. all of these things are hard for me to deal with but it's all part of growing up and letting go. 

everything is changing so fast. school, friends, guys, work, everything. my thoughts in my head are so random and jumbled up that it's hard to get everything straight. writing in my livejournal helps but doesn't do everything. 

anyways, i guess i'll be going now. oh yeah, shea that song was great. i've never seen the lyrics before."

and me and daemion went back to school shopping.

he is going to be in high school and it scares me a lot. i can't believe how fast my high school years are going. it's kinda sad ya know. it's like...i still remember coming to my freshmen orientation. and then my sophomore one when i thought i was so great because i was that much older. now all these kids look up to me because i'm older and it's just weird. 


i dunno i guess i'm in one of my thinking moods. haven't been in one in a while but ya know. my last days of summer will consist of cheerleading, world history homework, work, and a little partying. tonight i don't know what i'm gonna do...i've done so much runnin around in the past two days. maybe i'll stay in and watch a movie?

hm. maybe.


tomorrow i have cheerleading then work. :( 

it's gonna be a long day.

still...two crazy parties in one weekend. what am i gonna do?

party at my house was krunk last night..til the cops showed up. thank goodness nobody got in trouble.


seriously, it was really really scary. but now all i can do is kinda chuckle.

that cop was a dick for real though...he was like hitting on my mom. he gave her his ""off duty"" number. 

and tonight we are going to cowboys and i know its gonna be packed. but at least there is no way i will have to deal with any cops...lol now i'm so scared to even have people at my house.


haha...cheers to hiding under the bed and ""hiding in the woods""...haha shelby and steph...those poor girls. ahh i'm just rambling. even though the party got busted up i still think it was kinda fun. and maybe in a few weeks it will be something i can look back on and laugh about.

"event","i can't decide if dating older guys is better for girls to do in high school or not. because here's my problem...dating shea was like a real relationship...almost like we were both in our twenties or something. and now i try to date other guys...like guys my age and its really weird. they just don't view relationships the same way.

so i'm in a bit of a predicament. because older guys don't always wanna give younger girls the chance. so i'm not sure what to do. maybe i need to just date different kinds of people and stuff. i don't know.

"event","wow last night sucked big time. it was alrite until i got online and had to get into that argument with shea...why can't me and him just let things be? but of course we can't and we always fight...i don't know why i even try to avoid it because me and him are always gonna end up fighting about our past.

anyways, today at cheerleading i was so tired. also, i haven't been wearing my boot for a little over a week and my foot swelled up really really bad today. so after the camp was over mccoy was just like         chera you can go home if you promise me you're gonna ice that foot. so now i'm home.

and i'm icing.

i think its really crappy that while my foot is still in the healing process i'm practically a varsity alternate. like, i have been learning the jv routine and practicing with jv and such. i dunno i just wish that if she was gonna make me do this jv thing i should have gone the other route and just cheered varsity football. oh well...


about pennsylvania...well let's see. the last night i was at rachel's a bunch of people came over and we all watched movies. rachel has movie parties a lot and i think i'll steal that idea from her. i could totally have movie parties at my house. then wednesday night around 6 ish brian came and picked me up from her house and i spent through sunday at his house. he took me out to the olive garden on wednesday and then we went to one of his friend's houses and there were like 10 guys there having a poker tournament. i joined in on the fun of course but me and brian both had to lose because we had to be back at his house by like 11:30. then thursday we chilled around his house and that night went over and hung out with his friends again. it was a lot of fun because i was friends with a lot of those guys too. friday night i went to the movies with rachel, kelsey, alex, and this guy named sip i think(?) and then i met brian and his friends at eatin park and me and brian went to his house and watched movies all night. thennn on saturday i spent some time at brian's grandmother's house, went swimming at his friend bill's house, got to visit with alan, and then that night i could tell brian wanted to play poker with his friends so i hung out with him while he played....he could have won too but he made a stupid bet and lost all his chips. 

dumb boys. he got real mad too. oh my gosh i have never seen brian so mad as i got to this past visit. i saw him get mad twice...and it is insane. lucky enough he doesn't ever get mad at me. so it's all good. 

anyways, now rachel is in new hampshire...so i wont' get to talk to her for like a week. plus tomorrow and the next day i have cheerleading too and it sucks big time. 


i'm still icing my foot...its been a good 30 minutes or so of ice. i think the swelling is starting to go down, though."

"event","so i'm back at home. momma, daemion, mark, and aunt ali were at the airport to greet me. rachel went to new hampshire for mission trip and brian saw me off onto the plane.

i had a very nice trip. i think this trip help me cope with a lot of the feelings i've been having lately...about shea, jamie, actually about guys in general. i really got a lot more out of it then i thought i would. i was just thinking it would be a normal vacation ya know? but i guess you realize things at weird times and my time happened to be when i was up north.

by the way, have you ever had funny flashbacks?? because as i was riding around center on various occasions i would go back to a certain time and it was like i was there again and then i'd blink and be back where i was. it was really weird but i had flashbacks like that the whole week that i was there.

anyways i keep rambling but random thoughts enter my head all at once and i don't know how to put them all down. now me and shea are talking about things and it is weird. i don't like talking to him about our relationship anymore because we don't talk. all we do is argue. i guess it's good that we do this online because then i don't have to hear him yell at me. well maybe he wouldn't yell. but the only thing worse then him yelling at me is hearing him upset. and i just don't think i could stand to hear either right now because then i would be upset. and right now i don't wanna be upset.


i hate it when i ramble. i've lost everything about my trip that i was going ot put into this entry...i will have to update tomorrow when not so much is on my mind about shea and when i'm in a better mood."

after that, we all went to kelsey's boyfriend's house, luke's and we hung out until around 1 ish. then us girls came back to rachel's and spent the night. today me and her and her brother all went to the wave pool. gah rome, ga needs a fuckin wave pool! so we tanned and then got in the water and then tanned and such. it was a lot of fun and me and wrachel got caught up on a lot of things. thennnn we came home and got showers..well she is getting hers right now. so yeah, i don't know what we'll do tonight. but tomorrow maria is having a pool party. that should be fun. maybe i'll get to tan again! haha, i wanna come back to georgia all tan and stuff so that my friends down there will know that the summer up here is cool too. then maybe some of them will come up with me next year....maybe. haha. 
anywho, i was just wanting to update everyone. i hope everyone's summer is going well.

anyways, about the depression thing...i hate it when i am like this. it happens every once in a while and i'm just in a really bad mood for a while. so...yeah i need to get out of this mood.

mom's boyfriend ryan got into a really bad car wreck on monday. he had to be life-lifted out to a hospital in atlanta and there are a ton of things wrong with him. first off, he has head trauma, his eye socket is broken, his head is fracture, both his lungs collapsed, his liver and splean ruptured, he broke his leg, and he has laserations all over his body. he is in really bad shape and mom has been at the hospital with him since monday. so i've had the house to myself...and i've had to take care of myself.

so shea just informed me that he might be going into the army soon...we've had little or no contact at all for the past two weeks and it's weird hearing him say that. i feel like he is a completely different person whenever me and him aren't together and it's weird to me because i stay the same. like, he changes his outlook on work and everything when me and him aren't together...ahh i dunno.

tonight was supposed to be a girl's night out but i guess its not gonna happen. shelby has no money, autumn wants to go saturday, briana and anna made other plans....ahh you guys suck! haha, they'll never read this though :( oh well...i guess we'll plan it for another day.

saturday:
took autumn to work at freakin 9:30. got my hair cut (yippee!). went and got marty and justin who i hung out with the rest of the night. we went to the mall and cici's...then we went and saw matt spears at k-mart and went to his house to play pool. his house is so freakin awesome! then i came home and fell asleep.

sunday:
happy father's day! except i don't claim my dad so i wished my grandpa a happy father's day. me, momma, daemion, ryan, daddaw, mimi, ashley, and madison all made a trip to the tennesee aquarium and the imax. it was actually really fun to spend the day with my family. i enjoyed it a lot...other than the fact that ryan was there and all. but still, i would love to do it again some time soon. my little cousin madison is so freakin cute. i hope i was half as cute as she is when i was her age. but anyways, then i came home and me and shea hung out that night. he was at his mom's in alabama all weekend.


my weekend was actually pretty fun! today i worked for the first time since i have been broken. you walk so much when you're a hostess and my foot is killing me. but oh well i'll have to suck it up...the next time i work is on friday night so i'm sure it will be feeling better by then. anyways, its late and i should definently quit rambling...

yesterday was pretty fun. i was with shea for a lot of the day. we went to his house so he could do some laundry and i fell asleep of course. then when i woke up we came back to my house to get my swimsuit b/c we were goin to a pool party at like 9. thennnn we went to las palmas...mexican food is the shit! after that it was the pool party at stephanie's...(shea's best friend). it was me, stephanie, shea, scott, kim, laura, lindsey, and bethany...i didn't really know anybody but shea, steph, and scott but it was still fun. they are all older than me too...i think i was the youngest one there by like 3 years! haha, anyways, it was really cool.

"event","what it isssssss

lol...today has been cool. the only thing that sucked was getting up to go sit at gay cheerleading conditioning this morning...its so stupid that i have to go because i can't do anything anyways. but then i went and took autumn to work and then i came home and me and stefanie went and layed out on the trampoline. it was so funny, we like had the water hose runnin for twenty minutes and we kept using it to cool off. it's so hot outside today! and sunny! and beautiful! i love georgia during the summer when it's hot and sunny...i really hate it when it rains though. but anyways, then i took stefanie to work and me and mom went and ran some errands. we had to pick autumn up from work and then we went to penny annie's to buy some clothes. it's this really cool place that sells used clothes but they are like in good condition. mom got a bunch of shorts and summer stuff like that and i got a shirt. i'll probably go there whenever i get my paycheck because i wanna get some new clothes so bad. i always love buyin clothes! anyways, after that we came home and now autumn doesn't feel good so she is sleepin...:(   

i kinda wanna go in there and take a nap but then i'll be tired the rest of the day...hmmm...oh well.

here in a little bit i'm gonna go get stefanie and take autumn to russ's. i guess stefanie is spendin the night over here again tonight. its cool though. i really like hangin out with her b/c we have a whole bunch of stuff in common. like, we act a lot alike and a lot of the same things get on our nerves and stuff like that. 

its kinda nice being able to drive again because i can finally go places and stuff. i don't have to sit around my house all day anymore which is great! annddd i have the freedom to go where i want when i want...i really love my freedom. its like one of the things i missed the most when i couldn't drive. 

tomorrow me and shea are supposed to go grocery shopping. i'll probably go over to autumn's in the morning because i'll just have mom drop me off on her way to work. then shea can come and get me some time in the afternoon after i lay out all day. my leg that had the cast on it is really burnt so i've just been covering it up with a towel when i lay out. i didn't realize that the tanning bed would burn it so bad but i guess it makes sense because it hasn't seen any sun in like seven weeks. oh well...it will get better. until then i'll just have to lay out with a towel over that part...lookin stupid. lol. 

ahh..well, i guess i'm gonna stop rambling now...oh yeah, this sunday i'm going back to my normal job. it's gonna be weird to be workin on the floor again...especially since i have this gay boot thing that i hobble around in. but oh well, i really need the money and i really miss working. friday and saturday i'll probably go in and roll silverware for a few hours that way i have some hours on my next check."

"event","today was freakin awesome! like seriously, one of the best days i've had in a long time.

pretty much what made it so freakin awesome was the fact that i got my cast off...and i can walk with one crutch or even no crutches if i wanna deal with some pain. but today was only my first day out of the cast and i think i did pretty well. my leg was so hairy! it was nasty...mom and shea took pictures for all those freaks out there who'd like to see ;)

hehe...well after i went to cheerleading practice and took mom to shorter, i went and met up with stefanie, autumn, and shelby at this chinese place. then we went to briana's for a little bit and jill came over. thennnnn we went to gary's to swim..their pool is so nice and it feels so good to go swimming when its so hot outside. after that, me and stefanie went and saw grayson for a little bit and then went and picked up momma from college......

then autumn, russ, grayson, stefanie, shea, shelby, and myself chilled at the hizzouse for a bit.

see?? told you i had a good day. now i'm talking to brian! who i haven't talked to in forever by the way...yay! 

i hope tomorrow is half as good."

today i crutched around the scott's antique show in atlanta with shea for about two hours...it was really a lot of fun. i had never been down there before and now me and shea are gonna go a lot...

i'm a nerd-i love antiques:)

also, daemion came home from his grandma's today...woo woo...

Oh YeAh! last night the party was so fun...:) it had to get transferred from my house to autumn's house but it was still cool. i wanted to stay the night but i ended up coming home instead...oh well it was still fun...""BEVERLY HILLS, THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO BE!!!"" hahaha...too great. 

anywho, that's my day/yesterday. i just got through playing computer monopoly...and winning with a buttload of money...bwhahaha...

i layed out for like an hour and my face and chest got really red. it faded a good bit though...and i decided not to lay out today but to do it probably monday instead. 

STAR WARS REVENGE OF THE SITH IS FREAKIN AWESOME!!

yes, the major stars wars fan has just now seen it...but still, at least i did go see it. and i absolutely loved it...i almost started crying whenever anakin was yelling at padamey saying that she had brought obewan kenobi to the lava planet....ahh! it was so awesome. and i must have all six movies on dvd whenever the set comes out...i just must. revenge of the sith is definently my favorite of all the movies.

let's see...oh yeah i went to work last night...and i wanted to murder the mexicans that work in the G.U. (where they wash the dishes). they were just bein really really annoying...so i'm taking tonight off. i told the manager jeff and he was like        why aren't you coming in??    and i said        b/c i can't handle those freakin mexicans anymore...i'm about to kill them. and i almost quit last night b/c of those bitches...but oh well. i just won't put up with all that tonight. i'm actually gonna have a night where i get to go out and do somethin...woo! it's insane. 

i think that's all...i guess i'm gonna go call autumn and see what she's up to. i just can't stay in the house until tonight...that's not fun.

"event","other than a bit of drama, yesterday was pretty good. i got out of the house for a bit...cheerleading practice, runnin around town, and other things. i went to the tanning bed and my ass is so burnt! ahh its funny but oh well it will fade. in a little bit shea is comin to get me and we are gonna go do a bunch of stuff around town. then tonight we're going on a real date...haha i know it seems like no big deal but me and him haven't been on a date in like 5 monthes...and that's pretty bad considering we've seen each other at least 5 times a week for most of that time. hanging out with him lately has been really fun and even though i still don't want to get in a serious relationship with him, i've really enjoyed the kind of casual relationship we have. 
anywho, i just got typing a freakin long thing for my mom...it was like 30 pages of this catalog thing that had to be put into a spreadsheet and it was about gay fishing and hunting stuff...BORING! it's a good thing i get 20 bucks for doing it or i would have to go die right now. 

gah, i just can't believe it's the summer time. it doesn't even feel like it...in a little while i'm gonna get to go up north and see everybody! oh my gosh...its crazy because i seriously haven't been up there since semi of 2003...that was about a year and a half ago...and i haven't seen brian since Christmas before last and i haven't seen my wrachel in a year! ahh!

i haven't written that letter to jamie yet...right now is definently not a good time considering what he'll be dealing with at home...plus i've been given the advice to give him his time and space. i'm sure he's just moving on right now....and its what i need to do too. me and him will always be close and i just have to deal that this is a hard time right now. ah, though i love him dearly i need to give us both time. i know that when its the right time i'll know to try to write him the letter or call him or something. it's just that timing has never been the greatest thing in any of mine and his relationships..."

MOM'S BOYFRIENDS ARE GAY!!!

i haven't written anything too serious in my livejournal in a long time. for instance, most of you don't know that me and john haven't spoken on the phone or otherwise in about a month. also, jane, though she was a good friend of mine for a while, grew apart from me whenever i stopped hanging out with john as often. i guess i was just blind to the situation that was really going on there...she didn't really care about me as a friend...that girl is so in love with john. anyways, those things have really been on my mind lately. i've been thinking a lot about how i have changed over my first two years of high school and how i will continue to change in these next two years. when i saw the seniors graduate on saturday i realized that that will be me in just two short years. and i want to be one of those people that get to walk up on the stage first and make a speech to the entire audience. i have always dreamed that i would be the valedictorian...and for a while that dream got lost but i still want it with all of my heart. going towards something like that can't be accomplished with fake friends, either. i hate to use the term fake friend but i have seen jane lie...and she can be very good at it. and though she is fake, she is a very convincing kind of fake. i'd rather have friends that are a little crazy than friends who aren't really friends. although john really was my best friend...he really truly loved me and now he is just getting over me. that's all there is to it.

*i used the names jane and john in place of their real names...even my livejournal is not really that private*

as for things with shea, me and him are not together and are not getting back together. we just happen to hang out a lot. that will probably change soon, though, because he is going away for this job for his new work. plus i'm supposed to get my cast off in exactly a week and i hope to be working every day...well maybe not every day but most days. i don't want more than 2 days off a week. wooo...it was good to finally write a lot of that down in my lj...i've been wanting to but i never really was in the mood. it makes me really sad to think that me and *john have grown so far apart when we used to be inseparable. and i'll always love him so much...i just hope that he knows that i will always be there for him. no matter what. actually, maybe i should write him a letter telling him that...hmmm i may just do that"

My partner's weird, I guess. I've been hearing some stuff about him around school, not that I really care or anything. If he's some kind of trouble maker <s>who is worse than me</s>, I am going to straighten him up. :/

Reeeeaaaally bored now. I think I might just have to hold a party or do some kind of silly thing. Egh.

"event","Ha ha ha, fuck this school. It lets in just about everyone. Even worthless people like <b>them</b>. Well, whatever. Who cares about them anyway? Morons.

So, there's <b>Jinno-sensei</b>, being a real pain in the ass again. I have no idea why he is so strict, especially to his 'students'. Pfft, when I become more powerful and learn to fight alongside using my Alice, I am going to do something about his attitude. Disgusting. And he's a teacher.

I might just throw his frog out of the classroom or something. Ugh.

There's this <i>two-star</i>, <b>Marui</b> was his name, or whatever. No, I will not say sorry to your partner. It's his fault for flooding my friend's page anyway, but whatever. I'll let it go this time. 

And, damn. <b>Atobe</b>, you just like to piss people off, don't you?"

"event","So, yeah, I'm back to school bitches. 

Che. Boring today again. There's just no one around here that can match up to my superior skills. Well... That's to be expected of course. There's this new <s>kid</s>guy who's some kind of fire freak and he happens to be my partner. OH JOY. As if I care. 

I think his name was <b>Shishido</b> or some other shit close to that name. Really don't care, he's my partner, so what? He's a new student, I'll be in charge. Got that? Shishi... whatever-guy? You better not drag me down. Of course, I'll try to help you as much as I can as long as you don't go all whiny, bitchy on me. I'll kill you.

Okay, maybe not, but, whatever. Get my point? 

Hmph. Damn <b>Jinno-sensei</b>. Too much extra school work. As if I need to do these things. Pfft."

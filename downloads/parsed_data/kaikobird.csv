"event","Today was boring. I woke up, took a shower, and then went to school, The classes were bring as well. Mr. Watson made me come by after school to checkout a science book to study for the exam, but I was in his class anyway ... so it made me mad. Then I sit by this girl who grades my papers way to strictly. It gets annoying. I can see her red pen hovering over each answer, ready the put an 'X'. I hate people like that. Sometimes I even give her an answer that was totoally wrong, and she sees, and then she doesn't give me anything for it. ~whines~ 

Math was stupid. I just sat there and did my review, but then I realized that I have to read a book by tomorrow. And I was on pg 19/300. I still havn't started to read. It is 10pm right now, too. I guess I am a procrastinator.

GT was boring as well. These girls are making 'GT T-Shirts', and the idiots in my class elected to make them hot pink colored. ~sighs~ I won't wear it. Lunch was fun. I was having fun with my apple juice. :3 Me and my friends were going, ""EEEEE!!"" in a high-pitched voice over and over, xD I loved it.

Then it was art. I brought my CD Player with some happy music in it. As always, me and the people that I sit next to just talk and find weird things in magazines. Tomorrow is the art party. I am bringing asparagus. They all think that I am weird. :D 

Last period is AIDE, where I just sit in an office and stuff papers and open idiot's lockers. This one kid was extremely short, extremely obnoxious, extremely stupid, extremely annoying, and extremely smelly. He wouldn't walk normal. He was also screaming in the halls, and he wouldn't shut his little mouth. Then when I got back to the office, I found that this stupid kid that annoys me is assigned to 'help in the office' instead of doing a D-Hall. He is all those things listed above about the short one. I hate him.

Then I got home and I opened my backpack, discovering that my headphones had been crushed and broken. I was crushed and broken as well. I might glue them ... or not. I loved them.

Now it is here. I was going to go to the school to run, but there was a dog walking around with someone I couldn't see, so I decide to head home. Seeing that I live right across the street, that wasn't a problem.

It is 10pm, and I need to go read. This livejournal thing is interesting ..."

"event","Today I woke up . . . and my sister gave me a chicken sandwich. I ate it, but I didn't want to because it had lettuce on it. If the lettuce looked good I would have eaten the lettuce, but alas, it looked old. :P Then my sister and I just watched old gameshows from the early 90s. It was fun. Then I went on the computer and then on Gaia. Yep.

Then I was informed that I had to go to my sister's graduation at some giant thing. My aunt came, and Kara (my old baby-sitter from long ago. she is a good family friend). Then we drove there and went inside. it had lots of people. Kara noticed that many poeplw were wearing limegreen. It was scary. Since my last name starts with a 'Y', we had to wait soo long for all the names. And there was this weird obese guy with a beard who was handing out the 'certificates', which turned out to be a stupid poem thing writtin by the principle about 'your life being a road, ther are many feeders', or some crap like that. 

Then we got in the car and listened to 'Let Me be With You', an awesome happyfuntime Japanese song. Very happy. I love happiness. But then it turned out that there were like . . . over 2000 people trying top get out onto the highway. So traffic ened up backing up for miles. And there was this lady who was smoking and she wouldn't let my mother turn first, so my mother got pissed and was like, ""SMOKING GIVES YOU WRINKLES!!"". Yeah. xD 

Then we went to eat at a seafood place. It was very clean. I like clean things. I don't like fish, though. Acctually, I loath the thought of eating a fish. Especially a cephalopod. I love those. :3 Not to eat . . .

Then I got home and I was bored . . . my mother lost $200 in cash and found out that it was in her purse the whole time. The I went on Gaia, but it got boring fast, so then I was looking for 'Cute AIM Icons' on Google, and the search results did not like me. So then I went here to create a new account, so here I am. :D"

am i really that dependant on her? i sure as hell hope not! or else im going to be totally screwed when august rolls around. god i just want to leave already!"

"event","HOW MANY MINNESOTA COLLEGE STUDENTS DOES IT TAKE TO CHANGE A LIGHT BULB?


1. At Augsburg, it takes seven and each one gets four semester credit hours for it.

2. At Bemidji State University, none, Bemidji doesn't have electricity yet.

3. At Bethel, it takes none. They don't screw.

4. At Carleton, it takes two. One to change the bulb and one to explain how they did it every bit as well as any Ivy Leaguer.

5. At Concordia, it takes ten. One to figure out how to screw it in, nine to find an ugly enough lampshade to match their school colors.

6. At Gustavus, it takes six. One to change it, two to mix the drinks and three to find the perfect J. Crew outfit to wear for the occasion.

7. At Hamline, it takes three. One to change the bulb and two to phone a friend at St. John's to get instructions.

8. At Macalester, it takes four. One to screw in the bulb and three to figure out how to get high off the old one.

9. At Mankato State University, it takes 1, but it takes him 6 years.

10. At Moorhead State University, it takes 3, one to change it and 2 to crack under the pressure.

11. At St. Ben's, it takes 4,one to change the light bulb and 3 to figure out how it will help them meet their future husband.

12. At St. John's, it takes none. We get the Young Tommie Sluts to do it for us, and they make us lasagna.

13. At St. Mary's, it takes five. One to change it and four to talk about how they would have done it in Chicago.

14. At St. Olaf, it takes 100. One to change it, 49 to talk about how they do it better than Carleton, and 50 who realize it's all a lie.

15. At St. Thomas, it takes eight. One to change it and 7 to bitch about how they wouldn't have gone to St. John's/St. Ben's even if they could have gotten in.

16. At University of MN St Paul, none, down town St. Paul looks better in the dark.

17. At University of MN Twin Cities, 4, one to change the bulb, and three to write up a complaint to the Board of directors stating that they could have gone to a better school If they had wanted.

18. At the University of MN Duluth, the whole student body, there's nothing else to do in Duluth on the weekends.

19. At University of MN Morris, it takes 1; he just holds the bulb and waits for the world to revolve around him.

20. At Winona State University, it takes 3, one to change it and 2 to figure out how to turn it on.

21.At St. Cloud State University, ""who gives a FUCK ... let's drink in the dark!!!"""

anyways, its recently hit me that this time next year, i will be in college, away from home and on my own. this thought is ,well, utterly terrifying right now. between my parents freaking out and my own personal thoughts on this subject im just so emotional about it all. ill have a lot to talk about tomorrow with the doc.

one more month until christmas break, only 4 more long, tedious weeks left. it will be long. it will be daunting. but hopefully it will go by as quickly as the rest of this year has so far."

     i just want to feel normal again, happy even. i hate feeling like i have nothing to give, but i know that in reality, i dont. something has to be missing in my interpretation of this because if there isnt, then i fear that there really is something wrong with me that i cannot solve on my own. i try so hard to hide my hollowness, but it gets harder by the day as i seem to drain more and more as the days go on.

"event","there are so many things that still remain unspoken deep within my heart. although i hope that their intentions are known, i dont think that they are thought to be true. my words seem sharp, cutting deep into something that might not be there, but so much feeling rests behind them that remains unsaid. i try to hide but only time can tell how long i can make this moment last. this moment when i know what i want to say but am to afraid to say it. i try to hide that i care, constantly, for the things that were, the things that are, and the things that will be -- both for myself and for those whom i love. i fail at this last thing. 

i cant care so much for those who i love and in turn, still take care of myself. on more than one occation this has been true. my true and full hearted compassion for others comes to interfere with my own health. due to circumstance recently realized (or recognized rather) by myself, i notice a pattern of up and down emotions, mental states, and healthiness. i cant keep it under control. if im caring about someone else whom i felt that i have lost, everything falls apart at the seems, but once i come to terms with things, everything gets sewn back up again. soon, that thread will run out and my ability to pull it back together will become harder and harder. when i get to that point, im really not sure what im going to do..."

"event","as i follow the will of my mom, i have been looking into atleast 15 more colleges (ones that i dont really want to go to). i feel as if i am wasting soo much of my time doing things for her that i see as being completely pointless. she thinks that if im in the same state, or the same city that im going to be happy with a school, even though its not the one that i actually want to be at. it just doesnt work that way. there are always certain characteristics about each college that im already applied to that i like, and thats why i applied there. but she tries to hard to make things difficult for me.

that and she has no faith in the fact that i can handle certain classes this year (namely IB AP Calculus), but i dont really care because i want to take the class, surprisingly... so shes just going to have to deal with it.

anyways.. even though i totally am not ready to go back to school.. im kinda excited to put myself back into that type of situation again. it will help me get over certain aspects of my life (and probably help me forget about what ive lost), it will get me on a more regulated schedule, which ive decided that i really need, and it will put me back with all of my bestest buddies that i havent seen all summer.. unfortunately..."

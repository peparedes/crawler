"event","So, halfway through my last semester in college, and I'm behind on more than one class.  The good news is that I'm fairly confident that I can still pull out a passing grade (even if not an amazing grade) in most of my classes.  I'm talking with my professors tomorrow to see what I need to do to pass, and to make sure that I do it.

The bad news is that I'm not so confident about one class in particular, and I have my doubts about another.  If I don't pass them and graduate this April, then I'm not only going to feel sheepish, I'm going to feel downright sick.  I know that I can just take the one or two classes that I need next Fall semester (or, heaven forbid, Winter semester) and graduate later, but it still feels like failing.

I'm scared and sick and depressed about the whole thing.  Still, there's nothing I can do about it but talk with my professors tomorrow and see what they say.  Providence willing, I'll work out a plan with each of them to ensure that I pass my classes and graduate in April.  Worst case scenario, I fail one or more of the classes and (potentially) lose my eligibility for further government aid next semester.  Even if that happens, I'd only be taking, at the most 6 credit hours in the Fall, and I can just save up to pay for that over the summer, or something.  It's not the end of the world.

But I still don't like it..."

"event","So, it seems like things are looking up for work.  Since I'm doing translation, now, there's a lot more avaiable work for me than when I was just proofreading other people's translations.  If all goes well, I'll be earning more per hour (I'm paid by the word, but I can still earn more per hour doing this than with an hourly wage) and getting more work to do.  I hope it works out.  I'd like to get 40 hours or so per week once I graduate and be able to support my family, albeit on a slim budget, while I get experience in the translation field.  That way, 2 or 3 years down the line, I can get a nice translation job that'll pay better, be more stable, and let us live somewhere that we want (like Washington).

We'll see.

Now, I just need to make sure I don't fall so far behind on my schoolwork that graduating becomes an issue..."

"event","I think part of the problem that I've been having with feeling confused, overwhelmed, and/or depressed is that I don't have my priorities straight, so I'm consequently faced with the prospect of doing everything when that simply isn't possible.  Instead, I do a scattered amount of this, that, and the other leaving myself feeling upset that I haven't done more and stressed out my ears.  The solution, then, is to figure out what my priorities are, list them out clearly, and triage my life to keep it simple and take care of the most important things first and foremost.  So, I've decided to write down my priorities to help me see them and ingrain them in my mind and heart.  Hopefully, this will make it easier for me to focus on what's the most important and get done what has to be done, letting what isn't important fall by the wayside as necessary.<br>
1) My family and my God; I shouldn't have to choose between these, but they're definitely at the top.  If my wife or daughter needs me, I'll drop anything to take care of them; and my God, my religion, is too important to sacrifice for anything.<br>
2) My education; I've only got a little over 2 months left to finish my undergraduate schooling and get my BA.  If I do this, job opportunities will open up for me that didn't exist before, and if I fail to do this, then it's going to haunt me for the rest of my life (not to mention all that wasted student loan money I'll have to pay back).<br>
3) My job; I'm working on translating patent documents now, instead of just proofreading the translations.  If I can hold onto this job and do well with it, then it will get me invaluable experience in the translation industry which I can use to get better jobs down the line.  Plus, of course, the money is kind of important.<br>
4) My sanity; Although I need to be taking steps to ensure my sane, calm, and rational handling of all of my other priorities, the sorts of activities that I engage in to manage stress and deal with my life better--such as playing WoW, D&D, reading, etc.--should not trump my higher priorities if there has to be a choice between them.  After I have taken care of my obligations to my employer, my professors, and my family, I need to take care of myself and take time for myself and my relaxation and entertainment.<br>
5) My house; After my family, my schoolwork, my career, and my mental/emotional/social health are taken care of, I need to make sure that my clothes are clean, my dishes are washed, my floor is picked up, and my house is in good order.  Obviously, I'll need to take care of these things while handling priority 1 (my family), but if I need to push them to the side for a bit, I need to push them to the side for a bit.  After I've taken care of everything else, and kept myself stress free and sane, I need to clean up my home and keep it in good order.<br>
6) My parents, siblings, inlaws, etc.; OK, while it may seem harsh to put my extended family down underneath dirty dishes on my priority list, that's just the way it has to be.  If I need to choose between calling my parents, or doing things with my wife's cousins, or anything else like that and taking care of a higher priority, the higher priority wins out.  My wife and daughter are my family now, not the people I grew up with.<br>
7) My friends; Other than where they fit in to help me handle stress, they fall down here.  I need to let things go with them when I have more important things to do.<br>
8) Everything else.  'nuff said.<br>
So, taking this priority list as a guide, my wife feeling like crap trumps homework trumps translation trumps WoW (in reasonable amounts) to reduce stress trumps dishes trumps my parents trumps my high school buddies trumps WoW for fun.
For the most part, I think that works--at least for me.  I'll talk with my wife about it to make sure my priorities aren't messed up somehow.  Now, I just need to put it into practice."

"event","So, I'm freaking out a little bit, and I'm not sure why, about the prospect of translating 3 simple, short paragraphs from a patent from Japanese to English.  I was talking with my boss from the translation company the other day, and he pondered aloud about why I wasn't translating for them.  I have the perfect major for the job (Japanese/Linguistics double major), and I do good work with the proofreading/editing that I do for them; I just didn't quite meet their expectations for the translation when I tested originally to try and get the job.

In my defense, I didn't have any clue as to what their expectations and guidelines were, so I was shooting in the dark.  All things considered, I think I did a pretty good job (especially taking a look at some of the botched translations I've seen since via proofreading), and I probably would have passed if I had just been aware of what it was they wanted.

So, I should smoke this translation, impress my boss (and/or the editors) and get a position as a translator, and not just a proofreader.  No problem.

But my stomach is doing flip-flops and twisting into knots, while I hum and haw and stall doing anything.  All that I can figure is that I'm scared of one of the following:

--Trying and failing, again, thus consigning myself to an extended period of proofreading if and when there's work available for me; also likely ruining my chances of translating professionally for years to come.

--Trying and succeeding, and finding myself with a plate full of work to do on top of my schoolwork, housework, and the time I'd like to spend on my hobbies.

--Growing up and facing the ""real world"" as an adult in every sense; no more hiding behind school, no more postponing of career choices, retirement plans, debt consolidation, etc., just jumping into my post-graduation life a little early.

Maybe it's something else, too.  I don't know.  All I know is that I need to get myself over myself and just do it, do a good job, and get on with my life."

I only ended up working 20 hours last MONTH for my job, but I don't know how I could have fit more hours into my schedule.  I'll talk with my boss about getting more assignments for Feburary, and hope that I can handle them all.

On a completely unrelated  note, here are the lyrics to ""Bob"" by Weird Al Yankovic from his <i>Poodle Hat</i> album.  I like it because they're all a bunch of palindromes (and some weird ones at that).  Try dropping them into conversation some time and see what happens.<br>
Bob<br>
I man am regal, a German am I.
Never odd or even.
If I had a hi-fi.
Madam, I'm Adam.
Too hot to hoot.
No lemons, no melon.
Too bad I hid a boot.
Lisa Bonet ate no basil.
Warsaw was raw.
Was it a car or a cat I saw?<br>
Rise to vote, sir.
Do geese see God?
Do nine men interpret?  Nine men, I nod.
Rats live on no evil star.
Won't lovers revolt, now?
Race fast, safe car!
Pa's a sap.
Ma is as selfless as I am.
May a moody baby doom a yam?<br>
Ah, Satan sees Natasha.
No devil lived on.
Lonely Tylenol
Not a banana baton!
No X in Nixon
O, stone, be not so!
O, Geronimo, no minor ego!
Naomi, I moan.
A Toyota's a Toyota.
A dog, a panic, in a pagoda.<br>
Oh no, Don Ho!
Nurse, I spy gypsies, run!
Senile felines
Now I see bees I won.
Ufo tofu
We panic in a pew.
Oozy rat in a sanitary zoo
God, a red nugget, a fat egg under a dog!
Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog!"

"event","Is this job nothing but stress for me?  It's horrendous...  I just spent 5 hours proofreading, and (I guess) editing a translation that was the most abhorrent example of Japanese-English that I have ever seen with a claim of professionalism this side of Engrish.com.  When I FINALLY finish and turn it in, it turns out I was too late (kind of wish they had told me what the deadline was... frikkin morons...)

The good news is that it doesn't seem that they're upset at me (other than it being later than they needed), and they want me to be doing more of this pseudo-proofread-editing in the future.  Once again, I find myself confused about whether I'm doing well or poorly at this job, and am stressed to the point of giving myself an ulcer about it.

So, I think I've bugged the crap out of my boss, today.  He asked me to work on a long, complicated proofread last night, and to get as far with it as I could today.  Unfortunately, I didn't get as far with it as I would have liked, but I finished the first part and got in touch with him a good 2 hours before the deadline and told him how far I'd gotten and how much more I'd be able to complete.  He told me that he had expected me to get farther and to not worry about the second half--he'd get someone else to do it.

Oy, I hate this.

Maybe I needed this to give me a good, strong jab in the backside so I'd go looking for employment post-graduation elsewhere.  After all, this isn't the most fantastic job in the world (though it's better than anything else I've had so far), and it doesn't pay enough for us to reasonably live anywhere other than Utah.  I should probably start getting feelers out.

As long as I can get a consistent 20 hours a week doing this (and, hopefully, 40-50 hours a week once I graduate) I think this might be a viable career for the next couple of years, or so.  We'll see how it all pans out.

The nicest part was that, although I had the assignment on a Sunday night (the translator got his work to my boss late, just barely today, and it's due tomorrow morning)--even though I was working on a Sunday night, I was at home with my wife and daughter.  It was a little distracting at the beginning, but then I focused on my work and got into a groove.  I did the work in my pajamas.  That's a first for me, and I like it.

Little Squishy was good for most of the trip, but started freaking out a bit towards the end, necessitating a mommy presence in the back (which is even more cramped than the front); and we got confused about the specific directions to get to my parents house once we got to the San Francisco area on I-80; but we're here now, everyone else is asleep, and I'm wide awake (likely thanks to the Bawls I drank to help me stay awake for the drive) sitting in the living room, typing on my laptop, and trying to figure out how to pass the time until I conk out, too.

The bad news is, the paper is due tomorrow, as well as two of my final exams.  Some more good news is that I already wrote the paper--in English--so I just need to change the format to a Japanese <i>zuihitsu</i> and translate the thing into Japanese, and I'm good to go.  Some more bad news is that I completely freaked out when I checked my final schedule tonight and realized that I had two finals tomorrow, including the one where I needed to turn in this paper, and I had wasted away my weekend playing WoW because I thought I had a few more days to finish the thing.

So, overall, it's not that much that I have to do, but I'm lazy and tired and don't want to do it.  I suppose that I should, at least, write the thing out in <i>zuihitsu</i> format tonight, even if I just translate it tomorrow afternoon before the final, but I'm needing to psych myself up even to do that much.  Oy, I'm such a lazy sack of crap...

Oh well.  It's not too bad.  I'll probably end up dorking around on the internet for another few minutes, maybe a half-hour or so, then get motivated enough to write the stupid thing; but at least I can see myself finishing it tonight instead of just scrapping it and going to bed.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Long post, so only read it if you've got some time"">I'm rather frustrated at the moment.  I'm supposed to be writing a 7-10 page paper comparing and evaluating 4 different translations of 5 different poems from the first chapter of <i>The Tale of Genji</i>, and I just can't get it to flow.  I can feel it in there, like water backed up behind a dam, ready to come out and just flow down to fill up the paper...  but it's stuck.  I don't know if it's because of ordinary writer's block, or if this is due to something else.

Maybe I'm burnt out on school.  This is my 9th semester at college, meaning that I'm halfway through my 5th year of my undergraduate.  On top of that, with the harsh pregnancy, then the arduous birth, then my wife's ensuing health problems, I've found myself barely able to cope with, let alone excel at, my schoolwork for the past 2 semesters.  I just want it to be over--I just want an opportunity to stop over-analyzing everything, to stop looking for that ""original"" perspective.  I'm tired of constantly having to impress my professors.  Look, I read the texts, I watched the movies, the video clips, the TV shows; all of it, I did all of it.  I know about modern Japanese culture, I know about the literature, I know about the underlying philosophies of the whole thing.  Go ahead, engage me in a discussion about it--especially in English--and I'll prove to you that I know what I'm talking about.

But the minutiae...  the incessant waves of minutiae...  All the time, over and over and over again, being asked questions that the professor doesn't even have answers to, being asked to fill out 7 pages of notes on a topic that we'll be covering once or twice, being asked to write up a personal journal of what I've learned every week...  I'm getting sick and tired of it.  No more.  I don't want to deal with this anymore.

It's all so pointless.  Yes, that skit from a Japanese comedy show is funny.  What are they talking about?  They're making fun of a Korean pop music group.  Why is it funny?  What do you mean why is it funny?  It's funny because it's funny, that's enough.  The humor evaporates when you over-analyze it.  Wait... now you want to know what its cultural context is in mid-1990s Japan?  You've got to be kidding me...  It's humor.  What kind of context is humor always in?  What kind of context is parody always in?  Do you want me to define parody from the ground up and write a paper on why my definition is valid before I write about the skit being funny because it's a parody, next time?

Oh, wait.  No, no you don't want that, because someone might have thought of that before.  Well, we can't have that, now can we.  No, of course not.  We need to have original content.  No, we're not going to be publishing this, and, no, most of us aren't planning on pursuing research careers in the future; but we still need to make sure it's original anyway.  After all, we can't have repeats.  Someone might have thought of that before.  Can you be more esoteric?

Oh, yes, I've got it!  The skit is funny because the cultural context transformed the parody into a satire of a spoof where the crew was lampooning a farce!  It all makes sense now!  I just add an unnecessary level of complexity to my argument, while essentially saying nothing, and it's suddenly original!  Why bother trying to understand what it really is down at the core?  We don't need any of that.  We just need to look at it in a new way.  

Why, look at the 10 commandments from Exodus, after all; who needs to keep the same, boring interpretation of that anymore?  ""Thou shalt have no other god before me"" suddenly becomes a self-affirmation of how you should have no other ""god"" before you, since you're #1 and you're A-OK just the way you are!  ""Thou shalt not steal""?  Why, that just means that you should do your own thing and not try to worry about what other people are doing or thinking, since that would be ""stealing"" your essence from them.  And what about ""thou shalt not kill""?  Simple!  That's referencing the act of prematurely terminating your own personal progress in a preconceived idio-ideological paradigm discovering the universe within yourself!  Suddenly, those boring, stale, stodgy old commandments dictating a concrete social and mental morality now become a guide to the self-help wave of the future!  Be a religion of one!  You, and only you!  I mean, we can't possibly know what Moses (or whoever it was that really wrote that down) was thinking, or what their intentions were--and it doesn't matter anyway, because the interpretation is all that matters!  There is no meaning but what you give it!

*sigh*

You'd think the term ""B.S."" referred to the humanities more than the sciences.

So, regardless of my rant above, I'm still sitting here dreading the eventual process of finishing this paper.  It really has nothing to do with the above.  After all, I can pull this crap out of my own buttocks and convince the room that it is, in fact, a professional flower arrangement with the best of them.  Don't match up with me in a debate when I have nothing to lose, and no qualms about which side I take--it can get ugly.

No, what I'm feeling, and the reason I'm not writing the paper is for a completely different reason, and that reason is simply summed up in two--three if you're a Proscriptive Grammar Nazi--words:

I'm scared.

This is the last big thing I have to do for my ancient Japanese literature class.  After this, it's just taking a final, BSing my way through that, and getting the semester over with; and I'm scared to end it.  ""But,"" you will protest, ""didn't you just rant and rave about how you're so fed up with the system, and how you don't want to deal with this anymore?  Wouldn't you be glad for it to be over?""  The answer, my friend, is an acute window into the human psyche, so pay close attention and draw your own conclusions; this is one situation where not even the author knows what it means, so it's entirely possible that any interpretation might very well be valid here:  

I hate it; I despise it; I want it to end; but I don't know if I can handle what's on the other side.  Once this semester is over, I have to be graded, and what if those grades come out poorly?  What if they come out so poorly that I lose my opportunity for government funding next semester?  How will I get the money for tuition, books, rent, and other necessities then?  Even if I get good grades, I'll still need to deal with next semester, and under the best of circumstances, next semester doesn't look like it's going to be a smooth ride.  And then what?  I graduate.  I get my degree.  I become an official, accredited Bachelor of the Arts...  and then I need to find a job.  With a BA in Japanese, I can get a position translating documents--probably technical documents--or I could, possibly, work for a government agency such as the Department of State, the CIA, the NSA, or one of the other members of the alphabet soup.

What if I can't find a job, though?  What if the job I find doesn't make enough money?  What then?

It seems so overwhelming that all I can think to answer is, ""We'll roll with the punches,"" or, as my father is wont to say, ""We'll have to punt.""  He's a big football fan, after all.  The best laid battle plans fall apart as soon as you set foot on the field, and you are left with experience, insight, and improvisation.  I'm no slouch in those fields, but even in the best of times, such wild combat is exhausting...

...and I'm not sure if I'm ready for it yet.  Yes, I can see it looming in the future like some gargantuan giant bearing down on me; tramping fields and towns flat as he lumbers forward to stand in front of me, casting his shadow--his icy cold shadow--like a shroud over the landscape, and I stand--cold and alone--looking up at that behemoth with nothing but a strap of leather and some loose rocks in my hand.

The present is intolerable, but the future is frightening.  And so I am paralyzed.  I cannot go back, I am scared to move forward, and I am loathe to stand still.  Eventually, time will take me along, whether I like it or not--whether I'm ready or not--and I cannot resist its flow.  In the meantime, though, I stand here paralyzed... and unsure.

Somewhere within me, somewhere deep within, I know the hero is lurking.  I know he's down in there, I've seen him come out in all his glory before; and he is capable of taking that leather scrap, and those loose stones, and his own courage and ingenuity to topple this titan standing before me.  He can do this, if only I can find him.  Years ago, he fought the good fight, long and hard, and it wore him down.  Now, he's in there, somewhere, sleeping and regaining his strength; waiting for the time to come forth and fight the good fight once again.  He was wounded, and now he's healing; and I don't know where he is, or how to wake him from his slumber.

Maybe, just maybe, I can tap into just a bit of his power, and make it through this.  This is the Paladin inside of me, the Holy Knight, the Champion of Justice and Virtue--the Man that I know that I am and that I can be.  This is my Superman, and I guess I'm waiting for him to come back from a trip to Krypton.  I guess I'm waiting for my Spiderman to realize that it's his own choice whether or not he embraces what's inside of him, and lets his own doubts go.  I guess this is my Samwise the Strong, who knows that it's really about having the chance to turn back, but you don't; you keep going instead, because there's something worth fighting for; there's something worth dying for.  I guess...  this is me.

I guess I'm waiting for me to wake up.<lj-cut>"

"event","So, it's the 2nd to last day of classes today, and the last day for MWF classes, but I'm not going on campus.  My wife has come down with some tummy-nasty something-or-other and isn't feeling up to doing anything.  In such a state, I don't feel that it's fair to make her take care of the baby, so I'm staying home to help out.  I had to send an e-mail to one of my professors this morning to reschedule an appointment I had to meet with him about a term paper this morning, as a result, and it has me reflecting on the outcome of this particular semester.

I've gotten lectured, for the first time, about ""taking responsibility for [my] own education"" this semester, by the very professor that I e-mailed today.  I'm not sure what to think of the whole situation.  I mean, I failed my History 202 class last semester because of the time I was spending helping my wife (and, admittedly, playing WoW), but I never got a talking to in that class.  I haven't gotten lectures from any of my other professors during this or any other semester, and I'm being berated by this one.  Why is that?  Is he taking some kind of paternal role with me?  Is it because he made exceptions to his ""no late work"" policy with me due to my wife's poor health in September?  Has he forgotten the reason for making those exceptions?  Does he regret it, now?  I'm not sure what to think.

All that I know is that I want to be done with school.  I'm certain that I'm going to pass most of my classes this semester, if not all of them, and I can deal with failing the classes that I'm most likely to fail.  If necessary, I will go begging to get the money I need to pay tuition and help us survive next semester so that I can graduate in April and get my BA, so I can get a well-paying job to support my family.  Not graduating from college, at this point, just isn't an option.  I'm far too close, and it's far too important, for me to just write it off, now.  Still, I just wish it were over.  This is drawing out too long.

Oh well...  Just a few more papers to turn in (1 today, 2 tomorrow, and 1 next week), some finals to take, and a couple of books to finish reading and write up a quick assessment of for my major's reading list, and I'm done with the semester.  It's almost over.  I just need to hang in there a little longer.

One way or another, I'll make this work.  Somehow."

"event","So, I'm sure that my wife will make a post about this, but even if she doesn't, that's fine.  Apparently, school is really, really hard for her.  Hard for her to deal with, more than hard for her to do, I think, but I could be wrong.  After some conversations that we've had, it seems that she might have a mild form of dyslexia, which would explain a few things.

Regardless, the bottom line is that, to maintain her sanity, she's not going to school next semester.  I don't know when, if ever, she'll start going to college again--maybe several years down the line, when our kids are bigger--but whenever that might be, it's not now, and it's not going to be soon.

This throws a couple of complications into the mix, threatening to topple our delicately balanced house of cards.  First, she has a couple of thousand dollars due to the university for things such as tuition, trips to the student health center, etc., and the university wants her to pay up or they're going to a collection agency.  Well, I didn't expect them to go quite that far, but they're apparently serious about it.  So, we need to find a way to pay them off.  This will likely be in the form of a payment schedule that we can set up with them to pay it off in manageable chunks.

Second, if she doesn't go to school next semester, then all of the financial aid that we were counting on will fall through.  This means that we'll have to be creative with figuring out a way to pay for things such as the laptop I'm posting this on right now (which has to be paid off by the end of April 2007).  Other than that, though, if she gets a full time job (such as waitressing) for the duration of my remaining schooling (I should graduate in April), we should be able to pay rent, buy food, and all that jazz.  With the financial aid I'll be getting, we can probably take care of all the other expenses that we have.

Third, I'm definitely not going to graduate school, now.  Perhaps, in a few years' time, I'll apply and see where, if anywhere, I can get in, but chances are I won't.  In all honesty, I'll most likely get myself some entry level position with career opportunities and maybe even go back to school to get an MBA so I can eventually move up into management.  Also, since we won't have anything to tie us down here anymore, we'll likely move out of state to find greener pastures and better employment options.

I'm not sure what to think or do about this.  It's just one more ball added into the mess that I'm juggling right now; which consequently makes it just one more thing that I'm not going to worry about any more than I have to until I graduate so that I don't go crazy from the stress of it all.  I have so much on my plate that I find it hard to motivate myself to get up and out the door in the morning, let alone excel at anything I do.  I've gotten the ""academic responsibility"" talk from one of my professors this semester, too.  If you're not sure what that is, then I refer you to Dr. Connor's conversation with Peter Parker in Spider Man 2.  Yeah, it's kind of like that.  As long as I just focus and do the work, however, I should pass all of my classes this semester.  If I can do that next semester, too, then I graduate clean, even if it is without honors.  I just can't worry too much or think too much about all the balls I have in the air while I'm doing it.

I love my wife with all my heart, and I feel bad that I've put her in such an unenviable position.  I can't help but wonder if she might not be better off with a different husband--someone who can provide for her no matter what.  Part of me wonders whether my idealistic devotion to my family, even at the expense of earning potential, might not be askew; and if workaholic fathers might not be more fit to be fathers than I am.

I have to be careful about what I post in this, I know, because no matter what I do to it, my wife is going to see it eventually, and I don't want her to get the wrong impression.  I don't want her to feel bad, or get stressed, or freak out, or add one more brick to the load on her back.  I just need to unburden myself a bit, so I can better handle what I have to do.

When it comes down to it, though, there's nothing else I can do but square my shoulders, pick up a shovel, and start moving the dirt.  Looking at how far I have left to go is only going to discourage me.

So, if we can do the following, we'll be OK:

1)  Find a way to meet our financial obligations (laptop, university, rent, food, etc.) now and through next semester
2)  Find a full-time job for my wife that will work for me, her, and our daughter through next semester
3)  Find a career for me once out of college that will provide for us, and a way to get there (if moving is part of the deal)
4)  Get through this semester for both of us, and next semester for me
5)  Don't go insane in the process"

"event","This semester has been particularly difficult.  Due to incomplete grades that she never finished, my wife was put on Academic Probation, which made her ineligible for government financial aid.  As a result, we have had to count on what grant and loan money I could get for this school year to help us make it through this semester.  On top of that, because I totally spaced it, I didn't apply for a renewal of my scholarship for this year, so we didn't have that money to help us out, either.

It gets better.

At the beginning of September, I got into an argument with a foreign worker at my job cleaning floors at night at the campus bookstore.  He had a poor grasp on English, and I'm sure his pride was hurt, so my attempts to ameliorate the situation only made him angrier.  The resulting explosion got me fired.  He didn't get fired, of course, because he was a foreigner, and thus a minority, and thus not to blame, since I, the young adult white male, should have known better, I guess.  Pardon my cynicism...

And then, as the semester went on, my wife developed deep vein thrombosis, which required hospitilization and surgery, which led to both of us missing some of our classes.  A little while later, my wife starts to buckle under the stress of the semester, especially since we're counting on her getting out of Academic Probation this semester so that we can get her financial aid next semester to help us through, and starts to let her schoolwork slide.  So, I help her out, and talk her through it, and try to get things going better again.

On the bright side, she's got a job now.

I, however, am still unemployed.  I tried to get a translation job, but the editor didn't like my translation, so I was turned down, though they suggested that I take a few more Japanese classes and apply in another couple of months.

Since we were having difficulty, we tried to get what help we could.  The ecclesiastical leader for our congregation, as I've mentioned previously, turned us down rather spectacularly, which hasn't helped anything.  I tried to apply for a supplementary student loan from Key bank, only to be turned down.  I tried to find a co-signer, but the best I could do was a personal loan (together with interest) from my brother-in-law.  And, to cap it all off, I've recently gotten the ""you've got to take responsibility"" lecture from one of my professors when I apologized and asked for a bit more leeway with some assignments because of this nasty, nasty cold or flue or whatever it is that everyone in my house has right now.

So, I can't get a job, I apparently can't cut it as a scholar, and I can't get any help from anywhere.

To sum up, I've learned one overarching, if somewhat pessimistic, truth since August:

You can't count on altruism.  People do things out of the goodness of their hearts from time to time, and you can garner sympathy occasionally, but it isn't reliable.  Generally speaking, you'll get a hand from someone if they expect that you'll pay them back somehow, or if they anticipate getting some other kind of compensation within a time frame that's suitable to them; they might do so out of pure generosity, but that will only fly if it's a one-time deal and if you go right back to prior levels of productivity immediately.  If, for whatever reason, you don't turn right around and act as if the whole thing never happened, or if you can't guarantee them some kind of compensation, you probably won't get help from them--at least, not a second time.

I believe that, in their hearts, people are generally good.  However, I also believe that such feelings rarely ever leave their hearts.  They'll sympathize with your suffering, but they won't do anything about it.  They'll send you cards of condolence, or let you know how sorry they are for you, or they'll give you encouraging words to make it through your tough time; but if you ask them for help, their hands are suddenly tied.  In a flash, they go from sympathetic, altruistic, charitable beings to people who are too busy to help, or don't have the resources to help, or just don't see how they can get you what you need, or just plain don't care anymore.

It's sad, but it's true.  I've seen it many times over, and that's just in this brief 3 month period from August to now.  If Paul is right, and we are nothing without charity, then I fear that the world is a very hollow place indeed, and the intervention of our Savior is all the more sorely needed."

"event","Well, I suppose it's not wholly intolerable, seeing as how I haven't gone mad yet.  Regardless, it's still pretty bad.

I still don't have a job.  The applications I had out have more or less been consigned to the circular file, and it seems that my remaining options are limited to burger flipping.  I tried to get a job as a Japanese technical translator, as well, but the editor didn't like my translation for some undisclosed reason, leaving me once again in a slouch.  Fortunately, in a way, my wife has gotten her job back at the local campus creamery, although she is only ""on call"" status, meaning that she's on the payroll but she'll only get hours by substituting for someone else.  Hopefully, that will work out.

I applied for a private student loan from Key bank today.  Their 60 second approval didn't come through, which is usually bad news for me.  I'm hoping that they'll review it and decide to give me the loan anyway, but I'm not holding my breath on it.

On top of that, because our automatic savings plan pulled $25 out of our checking account on the first of the month (which I don't think it ever has done--it usually waits for the most inopportune moment, usually several days late, to pull the money out)--because it pulled the money out, the two charges that we made that should have cleared with no difficulty overdrafted our checking account, which means that we now have $50 in overdraft fees pending on our checking account.

It gets better...

I decided to do the dishes to at least try and get our apartment cleaned up somewhat, seeing as how I'm too stressed out to even face my classes this morning, but we're out of dish soap, so the best I can do is scrape of the dishes, stack them up, and wait until we can get some more.  We have an American Express card that we can use to buy essentials, if we need to, but it's only under my wife's name.

Speaking of my loving wife, she's currently on the phone with her mom, as she has been for the past 2 hours (which is normal for when she talks with her).  She got on to ask some information about her grandmother, since it directly relates to a history paper she's writing, but the conversation has, predictably, tangented off into uncharted waters and taken on a life of its own.  I'm not sure when she'll get off, at this point.

So, this morning has been somewhat... overwhelming..."

Yes, he's my ecclesiastical leader, but he's not the one that determines my salvation--that's Jesus' role.  So, when it comes down to it, he can't affect me in any serious or long-lasting way.  The worst he can do is offend me, irritate me, and possibly bruise my feelings.  He really can't do any more than that.

So why am I still angry?  Why can't I let it go?  Why is it still resting like a canker on my soul, pulsing and throbbing and attracting my attention morning, noon, and night?

It keeps recurring inside of me, and each time I am more angry, more violent, more hurt, more pitiful...  It keeps replaying over and over again like a broken record.

I have a paper that I need to write for my Modern Japanese Literature class that's due tomorrow morning, and I can't focus enough to even form a coherent thesis statement--and the paper is only 2 pages, double-spaced.  I can't focus on anything, because every time I stop to think, my brain goes straight back to the same issue.

Maybe I just need time.  Maybe I just need distance from the whole thing--enough that I can go about my life without feeling the impact of it every time I'm alone, or close my eyes, or stop and think...

I just want to scream at him!  To grab him by the lapels and shake him, and yell at him, and let him know what a horrible thing he has done.  I want to make him live the hell that I've experienced over the past year, and then give him the same encounter that he gave me, and see how much he likes it.

Most frightening of all, I want nothing to happen about it, so that I can see him burning in Hell when he dies; so I can know that his mistreatment of me will have damned his soul for eternity, and that he will know his own torment was brought down by himself on his own head.  I want him to rot like the maggot he is.

...and I shouldn't feel that way.  I know that I shouldn't.  Didn't the Savior teach us to turn the other cheek?  Didn't he tell us to love those that hate you?  I should forgive and forget.  I should move on as if this never happened, and not let it fester inside me and make my life a living hell.  I should let it go.

I want to let it go.

Why can't I let it go?"

"event","I've been out of a job for about a month now, and my wife just recently got out of the hospital after dealing with deep vein thrombosis.  Everything has been so hectic, including my class schedule, that I haven't been able to secure a job as of yet.  Consequently, we have been unable to pay rent for September, and now October's is due, as well.

I have filed petitions with the on-campus housing office to try and mitigate some of the cost, but the geniuses over there said I should get a Stafford Loan (which I had already provided documentation showing that I had acquired the maximum amount, and where the money from it was going), or a part-time job (which I had just informed them I had lost).  Pure genius... I swear the office is run by monkeys.  Stupid monkeys.  With no imagination.

My next step was to see how things were going with my parents and in-laws, and money is tight all around (thank you, Mr. Bush--you're doing a fantastic job with the economy).  So, now, my next stop is to talk with my ecclesiastical leader, since in our church there is something of a welfare program to help out members in the short term with emergency expenses, and I felt that it was time to ask for help.

So, I went to talk with him last night and told him the situation.  He gave me such wonderful advice that I've been in a swoon ever since.  He said that:

1)  School is a luxury and unnecessary, and I should quit school to support my family.
--OK, I'm slotted to graduate in April (as he knows), I have thousands of dollars in student loan debt that would immediately come due if I withdrew from classes this semester (and no way to pay them), I'd have to pay back the government aid I've already received for this semester (which I don't have anymore) and there are no jobs that I could possibly support my wife and daughter on, WITHOUT the student loan payments added in, without a college degree.  So, stupid suggestion overall.  On top of that, the general leadership in our church have recently asked that all the men get as much education as possible, so why is he ignoring this counsel and telling me to drop out of school?

2)  I had been wasting my time for the past month, and that I needed to step up and be a man now.
--What, has he had his brain sucked out?  He was in the hospital when my wife was there with the DVT, and he knew about the rough pregnancy she just got through when our daughter was born in June.  He KNOWS that I've been taking care of my wife and trying to stay on top of my classes at the same time for the past month; so why would he think that I somehow had enough time to find non-existent jobs in the area?

3)  He would pay for September to help us out, but after that we were on our own.
--So, apparently, charity is a concept that is good to apply to people living in Somalia, or victims of tsunamis and hurricanes, but really isn't applicable to the man who's trying to get a college degree with an infant daughter and a wife who's been in the hospital twice in 4 months, including ICU one of those times; especially when he just lost his job.  No, that's his fault, and he deserves what he gets.  He should handle it himself.


He then went on to all but threaten to revoke my ecclesiastical endorsement (a necessary document for my continued education at my current university) if I didn't do what he said.  At least I know that he won't go that far.  From now on, I'll be filling a seat in the pews, because that's obviously what he wants.  I will be assiduous in assuring that I am in attendance for Sunday services; so, at the very least, I can stay where I am long enough to get my BA and put this behind me.

But, you know, he's not exactly helping the situation.  He clearly doesn't have my best interest in mind, nor my welfare--physical or spiritual--or he wouldn't have been such a boor.  I admit that I haven't attended my Sunday services as much as I should have recently, due to my wife's health and my concern for her; but if he wants me to come more regularly, why is he being so holier-than-thou to me and directly flying in the face of advice handed down from general Church leadership?  Why is he speaking to me like I'm some kind of irascible teenager who's doing this to spite him?

I know that he's just a mortal man, and prone to frailty (like my ranting about him?  yeah, along those lines), and that it would be ridiculous for me to allow this to sway my opinion of the Church and God.  Even so, though...

It hurts.  More than anything else, it hurts.  When I need help the most, the one place that I would expect would be sympathetic (even if they can't help me for very long) all but treats me with open contempt and hostility.

I just needed to get that off my chest.  Maybe, someday, he'll regret how he treated me.  Maybe, someday...

Maybe..."

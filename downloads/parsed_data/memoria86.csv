Lol this poll is too cool!

Yay another day. Nothing really exciting happened today. I got to school kinda late because my sister had to give me so much crap. Why can't she just take the damn bus? When I got home around 1:30 I got in a fight with my step-father and he had to yell at me right in the face. Yelling at him only made it worse as I started crying. When both of them left I put my head ina pillow and screamed my lungs out. I hate crying and I hate my family right now. It feels like they're all against me. 

Work was smooth. For all of you who didn't know GTA San Andreas came out today and if you didn't reserve it you won't be getting it anytime soon. Better luck next time.

Rocky Horror Picture Show on the 30th! can't wait!"

"event","Well today was defiantly a Monday. I was tired and had the hardest time getting up. The bed just seems to call your name. Who would'nt want to leave it? It's so warm . . . and I'm not a morning person in the first place. 

Today was typical in the way that I went to study hall and studied a bit but spent the rest of it talking to Kate about Team America, about her life in Japan, and about Rick making weird noises during the naugthy. Believe me don't ask lol =). Later  I took a math quiz and I think I did pretty well except for on one question where I was stumped. In english class I did'nt do much. Just talked about Nazi's and passed in my book review. I also got Splenda poured all over me... yuumm...

I got a wake up call today. Reality is starting to sink in. I can't go on acting the way that I am. I need to get my priority's straight and start acting like an adult. I've noticed that I have become very insensitive for the past week and my head has been going in circles. My apologies to everyone. I know it does'nt mean much. After today everything is changing.

At around 3:30 Med and I came to my house and we hung out. I'm really relaxed. I'm so glad that he came over. It is so comforting to feel the security he gives me when he is in my presence. Just being with him for a short time he has opened my mind to be more open then it ever has been and I have been noticing this new beauty in pictures and art. Everything is becoming so beautiful, serene, calm . . . It's so weird how one person can have such an impact on your life. I'm realizing so many things now. I'm so grateful. About time I started showing it . . . .

"event","I woke up pretty late today, probably around 9:30, and slowly getting out of bed. The day only started to take shape when I took a long shower and watched T.V. for awhile. At around 1:35 I picked up Med and headed for school for Jacob to come by. Once Jacob came we followed him to his house and I got my CD player installed into my probe, an hour later then it was supposed to be but hey we still got it in and it works great. Kudos to Jake!

Later in the day Med, Kate, Rick, and I went to see Team America. Pretty good movie. After that was done with we dropped Rick off and Kate, Med, and I hung out in the Wal*Mart parking lot just talking. The night ended when I dropped everyone off. Okay day for a sunday I guess. Kate is awesome though! She's so calm and laid back when it comes to talking about everything. Gotta love her. Her and I just have to hang out sometime."

"event","Today was okay, except for the morning that is. Later in the night I went to Homecoming with Ethan and Gunnar. It was okay but nothing I would ever go to again. I thought it would be really good, guess you don't get everything that you want. Where are you Med? I miss you so much =(.

The night ended as we went to Denny's and then met up with some other people. The conversations I remember were about sausages, penguins, and Ethan sniffing salt.

Now I'm going to be heading to bed. I hope tomorrow is better. I miss you a lot dear."

"event","I am so incredibly sad. I want to cry my insides out and die in a isolated place. I feel so overwhelmed. I can't make everyone happy. Everyone seems to dislike me at this point in time. It feels like no one understands me. I feel like I should runaway but I know it would never solve anything.

My parents trap me and my sister dislikes me. Is there nothing I can do? I can't make everyone happy =(. I can't even make myself happy. Everything is becoming endless with no rest. 

I feel so guilty for reasons I can't even understand. I'm not happy. I have become depressed to the farthest extent. I'm sorry Kate for not being there for you at the parade there is just not enough energy to get out of the bed. I feel like staying there all day. 

Where's the support? Where's the emotion? I feel so violent. I want to cut everyone up and hear them scream. I can't feel any emotion. It's the feeling of cutting yourself up because it would make you happy. Hearing everyone else's pain would make me happy. There's a heavy burden on me that I can feel and it's not lifting up. Time to fall asleep and think no more. Life is endless and has no end. I'm so lost and I'm so afraid. Life is too long and I don't think I can deal with it."

"event","Today was very dull. I managed to fall asleep during a test in history class this morning. Later I spent the day sleeping in class and being bored. During last period, when I could have left, I went and finished my history examen and fell asleep on the green couch in the library. When everyone left I saw Cam and talked to him for a bit and then gave Alex a ride home. I love you sooo much Alex =P.

Overall though, today was boring because all I did when I got home was go to sleep and then head to work. Work is always awesome though. All of you need to come in and say Hi sometime. 

Love everyone of you =)."

"event","Yesterday and even the early hours of today were insane. Could anything scare me as much as not knowing where my car is? Thankfully I got it back at around 3:00 in the morning at an impound. I'm so glad it was'nt stolen. I would have freaked 10X worse.

Everything was going great for the beginning of the day. Hung out with Med and then went to Alex's house to pick her up. We then headed to Amy's house for awhile and got ready for the 'Rocky Horror Show'. I'll be wearing something next time since I did'nt dress up this time. When we got to Portland to see the show I found some parking with Alex but when we got out my car was gone. We had to ride with some girl that had been in the show to South Portland to get the car and it cost 65.00 of Med's money. I'm so sorry Hun but I'm so glad that you were there for me when I needed you. 

When got back to the Auburn area I had to drop Kevin, his girlfriend, Alex, and Med off at their houses. I did'nt even get home till 5:00 in the morning and did'nt hit the bed till 5:45 and I woke up at 11:00 because I could'nt sleep anymore. Oh well.

Next time anyone does any of this with me I'll make sure I don't go in a private parking area and that we'll have something to do afterwords in the Portland area. 

I hope the best for your valuables HUn. If there is anything I can do to help I'll do it. Sleep well."

"event","Wow what a day. Why does it have to be raining and that I always am late to pick med up? I'm a terrible girlfriend with no concept of time.

At around 8:30 I left school to get some coffee. Everything went fine until I almost did a nose dive into the floor because the floor was so slippery. Thank God for the man that caught me or I would have been really messed up. After I got the coffee I went to Rite Aid to be talked to a man that was sitting outside with Pepto Bismal. He just stared at my car and said it was nice. He seemed nice enough, it just bothered me that he had to stay in front of my car the whole time. Creepy.

I'm happy that I'm going to be able to have a CD player installed into my car soon. I'll now be able to listen to good music. This guy named Jacob/Jake said he'd do it for me for free when I got the parts. What a nice person =). 

Later on Med came over to my house and we watched numerous episodes of 'Aqua Team Hunger Force' with each other. When it came to be around 6:30 went left for Burger King and got a bite to eat and then headed to the Lewiston Flagship to see ""Shaun of the Dead'. What an awesome movie! Everyone has got to see it! We then went to the Auburn Flagship, watched a bit of Napoleon Dynamite, got to meet up with Cam and Alex, and then picked up Ethan and Shea so we could all go to Med's house where the hot tub is.

That hot tub is so much fun. Next time I go over I'll be staying in there forever. Despues the hot tub I took Shea home and went home myself to an upset mother because she does'nt want me to leave the nest. Iv'e gotta grow up sometime Mom. Lo Siento.

I love you Med! Nothing can compare to you! =D"

Alex I am so happy to see you today. It is about time that you showed your face! Tell me Alex, do you look at your bed the same way you did a couple of days ago? =P

My first day on the job working at Gamestop was awesome. The people are great but the pay is'nt the best. It's fun though and I that's all that matters. 

I'm wondering what I'm doing tomorrow. Anyone having a party? =)"

Besides having nothing go the way it was supposed to later in the day, the beginning half of the day was awesome. I can only hope that tomorrow will be better and then Friday will come. Thank God. I start work tomorrow at Gamestop. I can't wait to actually have some money on me.

It's so late and I'm so tired. I'm off to bed. Always thinking of you Med."

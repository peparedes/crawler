"event","I turned 45 last week, which is fine.  Trout took me mountain biking up at Winding Stairs Gap.  While I'll never be a professional, I'm did okay.  I made it up the uphills better than in the past and didn't feel like I was holding him up too much.  My legs were killing me though by the time we made it to pavement.  I felt good!  

Trout gave me a pedicure and manicure as a present.  Neither of which I had ever experienced before.  I have developed what I call old lady feet, so I was excited about the pedicure.  I made the appointment and drove up the mountain to Highlands.  In my excitement, I arrived too early and was killing time sitting in my car and listening to some Michael Franti when a group of preschoolers, all holding a rope, walked by.  One little bastard pointed at me and begin singing his own little song of ""Old grandma sitting in her car...Old grandma sitting in her car.""  The moment was so surreal I thought I had fallen into a Vonnegut short story.  I refrained from getting out of my car and pounding the little shit into a gooey pile of preschooler snot.  I sat there and wondered if all the women before me had such a defining moment of age.  Then I decided what the hell, it'll make a funny story, and I don't feel old.  

My pedicure was wonderful and my old lady feet are gone!"

"event","Trout won a new bike from REI on the Cycle North Carolina ride this year.  He decided to give the bike to me (he has plenty of his own).  Originally, I was going to get a road bike, as I ride a Giant Sedona (which I like but thought I might want to go faster until Trout had a horrible wreck the end of October and broke a collarbone and left a good portion of his face on the asphalt).

We had planned on going to Holland next summer and doing bike and barge trip.  The trip looks wonderful but seemed geared to ""old people,"" which we are not (at least not mentally).  I want to have a grand adventure that's tough; I want to be the fearless woman my husband fell in love with when I was 20.  I said let's do an adventure on mountain bikes out West--except I don't have a mountain bike and never really wanted one or so I thought. We contacted REI and asked if we could change the road bike to a mountain bike (we had not picked it up yet).  They said sure.

I decided to get the Novara Ponderosa, a beautiful orange and black hard tail.  Trout said the components were great; it's one of REI's top of the line bikes.  We made a 10 hour trip Saturday to pick it up, and I anxiously awaited my first ride on Sunday.

She kicked my ass.  A mountain bike is a whole different kettle of fish when compared to my comfort bike. When I stop pedalling, it rolls quite quickly to a stop.  I liked a lot of things about her, though; she went up hill better than my other bike, the shifters are cool, the disc brakes are crazy, and the ride is sweet.  I hope she doesn't kill me.

He called from Laurel, MS and said the damage was widespread--devastation, no electricity, no anything.  He'll call when he can, but I don't imagine that'll be much, as he was already having trouble finding cell phone reception. 

Ironically, the price of gas in Mississippi has not gone through the roof the way it has here in western NC.  There, in the midst of destruction and no gas, no one seems to be gouging the public--that's nice."

Bele Chere was fabulous this year--saw some great bands.  Tinsley Ellis rocked the house on Friday and was a tough act to follow for me.  We saw Drive By Truckers and Bonerama (great horn band from NOLA) on Saturday.  The fact that they charged for one stage on Saturday sucked and most of us festival veterans boycotted that show--boy, we showed them!

The first weekend in August Trout, Becky, and I went down to Panama City to scallop with Trout's family.  It rained for 2 days--for the first time we've visited in years.  Becky and I decided the heck with scalloping and headed for a beach in Gulf County with Cricket (our Jack Russell) on sunny Sunday.  It's the only beach we know of in the panhandle to allow dogs.  She loved it, and Becky and I soaked up the rays.

Trout took me to Heintooga in the Great Smoky Mountains Nat'l Park, and we biked down from the highest campground to Cherokee on a one way dirt road--it was great, and I finally broke the 1,000 mile mark on my odometer.  I also wore out my brakes on the 17 mile descent--it was beautiful and cool in the shade of the park.  We had to cross the headwaters of the Oconluftee River.  The water was deceptively deep and the gravel was fist sized--glad I didn't wreck.

I have been a complete slug as far as biking and fitness, since the first of July.  It's been so hot and we've had so much rain.  Of course, I recognize that these are both excuses; I really do plan to become that svelte model lurking inside me.  The last few mornings have been cool, so I'm getting inspired again.  Wish me luck.

Trout left this morning for Mississippi to volunteer his services in any capacity.  He's an RN but brought his boots, brush gloves, and a hammer in order to help in any way needed.  He's planning to be gone for at least a week and 2 at the most.  I'll miss him but am glad he can help--the hospital has agreed to cover his normal pay without using his PTO, which is pretty cool of them.  The other nurse who was going to go with him had to cancel; in the end, he left alone.  He'll be fine; he's a good soul.  He remembers Camille and its devastation and just felt moved to help.

School started on August 25.  I've 2 great classes (Eng 12 and Eng 10) and 1 challenging class.  It's a class of 29 freshmen and 20 of them are boys.  It's also an inclusion class (thanks No Child Left Behind), which means a number of the students have some type of problem;  I have a number of kids with serious learning disabilities in reading and 3 boys who are BED (Behaviorally and Emotionally Disabled).  So far they are pretty sweet but are a wiggly, giggly, bunch of kids in desperate need of someone's love.  One of them beat himself up on Friday with a padlock but had made up a story about being attacked by an unknown assailant--that's about the saddest student I've run across.  He hit himself hard enough in the face to raise welts and his cheekbone looked awful.  How awful must his life be to need that kind of attention--pretty awful I found out later. They make me cry.

I didn't ride all week; I was a bum.  But I did get out yesterday (14 miles) and today (18 miles) and am adding those totals as today's total.

I went to the greenway and rode for a little over an hour.  It was hot and the air quality was awful.  They're warning us that this year will be the worst on record, as we've already had more dangerous ozone levels than in any previous 12 month period and it's only the middle of May.

Now that he's home, I should get back to eating healthier meals.  I hate to cook for just me and the kids (now back from college for the summer) aren't overly fond of our new diets (lots of veggies and little meat).  I made a pretty good veggie teriyaki thing for supper.  Trout and I went to the greenway and did a short ride after dinner and then splurged on a small DQ swirl cone each.  Yum.

"event","The importance of wind in my life is bizarre.  I never noticed wind before, unless it was blowing over trees in my front yard.  But now that I'm riding a bicycle I notice wind all the time and hate it quite often.  Today, the only ripples on the Little Tennessee were rings from jumping fish, so the riding was fantastic.  

I'm much more confident on the bike; I cross the 4 lanes of traffic with hardly a worry (I still wait for it to be completely safe!).  And I don't brake quite as much on familiar downhills; I wish I still had my trip computer so I could see just how fast I took the downhill at the end of the greenway today.

Trout has called every night and sounds like he's enjoying himself.  I miss him when he's not here--there's no one to make me laugh.

"event","It rained like crazy this morning.  I turned on the Weather Channel to check out the weather in the Florida panhandle; it looked grim--heavy rain, thunderstorms, and tornado watches.  Trout called around 3pm to say that they'd been holed up at a BP station for a couple of hours, hoping to wait the heaviest rain out.  They plan to camp at Falling Waters tonight; we spent a night there on our honeymoon (22 years ago).  He'll have fun no matter the weather.

I cut the glass for a stained glass panel for a friend's kitchen cabinet.  She wanted colors that I'm not overly fond of but what the heck.  I haven't ground the edges yet, but I think she'll love it.  It's a abstract panel of overlapping circles.  It looks vaguely like planets.  I like its funkiness.

I headed over to the greenway at 3:30 and hadn't been riding for 5 minutes when my trip computer fell off.  Unfortunately, it was while I was crossing the Little Tennessee bridge, and I heard it crunch under the wheels of a big F250.  Damn.  I really hated not knowing my speed.  I doubled the route I took on Wednesday, so I know the mileage.  I'll have to see if Smoky Mountain Bicycles can fix me up.

"event","My God, headwinds suck.  I can't imagine having to ride all day in them.  I went to the greenway for my first ride in a week this afternoon.  I felt strong as hell and was booking right along in a bigger gear than I usually ride in and thought, ""Hey, maybe I needed a week off the bike to get stronger.""  Okay, that thinking is obviously flawed.  At that point, I had a tailwind--duh.  I did ride up both hills that have been vexing me--with a stop at the top of both to slow my heart rate.

On the way back, it sucked.  Sand was blowing in my eyes (with sunglasses on), it started to rain, and I had to drop way down in gears to keep up an 11 mph pace.  I was frozen when I got to the Jeep and decided to be a complete wimp and only do 9.1 miles.  This weekend I'm vowing to have a 30 mile day.

"event","We almost headed home this morning, as it was freakin' cold when we got out of the tent (30 degrees with high wind).  We were warm and slept soundly through the night while the wind howled and rattled all around us.  Something kept creaking in the wind; I've decided it must have been a tree.  It was too cold to do anything but break camp and head out for breakfast.  We decided to just go home, as we'd had it with standing in the cold and wind.

We went to the Huddle House and bought the local paper.  I read that the cyclists would be signing autographs before the start and was game to get my Tour poster signed.  It really didn't matter who signed it; I wanted to be up close with the cyclists.  We warmed up and decided we were game for another day of tour watching and headed out to watch the boys.

We ended up not standing in the optimum place behind the barricades for autographs.  One needs to stand in the ""rider sign in"" line, because they have to walk right by you, but, of course, that area was full to capacity (next year we'll know better).  Trout noticed that lots of people on the other side of the barricade had no credentials and urged me to go around.  

I walked up to the front of the line where the riders rolled in and was standing there when a guy next to me (with credentials) handed a camera to a woman and asked her to take his picture with Saul.  Saul Raisin is a 21 year old local boy (from Dalton, Ga--local enough) who rides professionally with the French team Credit Agricole.  OMG!  So I decided to stay put; when Trout came over and asked what I was up to, I said, ""This nice lady is going to take a picture of Saul and I'm hoping he'll sign my poster.""  She then said, ""I'm his mom, actually.""  Saul is now my new favorite.  He was sweet and kind, and because his signature was messy, he drew a smiley face.  One of his team mates, Mads Kaggestad, also signed.  I then headed off, at Trout's urging, to get Geoff Kabush's of Jittery Joe's.  I was standing directly next to Floyd Landis, waiting patiently, when he apologized to us all and headed off to the starting area.  What a great time.  We saw Bobby Julich, Levi Leipheimer, and the Discovery Team.  I'm a groupie; I hope a worthy,riding groupie next year.

No exercise, but who the hell cares--I was at the Tour de Georgia."

It is now paved and I rode up it in my granny gear--but I made it to the top.  Going down the other side, I hit 26 miles an hour, my fastest ever.  It was scary but felt great.  

Immediately after the downhill, there is a switchback uphill.  I only made it three-quarters of the way up before I had to stop.  A guy on a mountain bike sailed by me exclaiming, ""Wow, these hills are killers!""  To which I replied, ""If it kills me, just kick me out of the way.""  It was a good aerobic workout!  I'm going to keep at the damn thing until I get up it.

We rode the Old River Road in Nantahala.  It is now a Forest Service road, so it was well maintained for dirt.  Most of it was slightly uphill (if you read Trout's journal, he'll say flat) and a very small part had me panting like a freight train.  But I kept pedaling; I don't think I could have done it without stopping just a week ago.

We stopped at the Nantahala Outdoor Center for a quick supper of cheeseburgers and fries--very good.  It blows my diet, but I've been really good.  And to top off the evening, Trout made a blueberry cobbler (my fav) with our wild blueberries from last summer.

"event","I (and over 100 other Macon County school employees) attended a hypnosis session for weight loss last night.  I was psyched because I feel like I'm finally getting it together about my weight and health.  I fully intended to allow this to work.  

The hypnosis was interesting.  I have never felt quite so relaxed yet understood everything going on around me--actually I was afraid that I was too conscious.  It took about 45 minutes (after a 30 minute introductory session).  The hypnotist focused our attention on ""greasy, fatty foods,"" ""sugary sweet foods,"" ""drinking more water,"" and ""exercise.""  

I came home and we ordered Mexican.  I love chips and salsa, yet they were a non issue for me.  I looked at them but didn't really want one--AND DIDN'T EAT ANY.  I can't explain it.  I did eat the burrito and shouldn't have eaten the whole thing, but the more I think about those chips, I'm stumped.  The weirdest thing is that when I told one of my co-workers who also attended, she almost fainted.  They had gone out to eat Mexican, too, and she wasn't interested in the chips either and didn't eat any.  Weird.  But hey, if it helps, I'm all for it.

I then went out to Cullasaja Center for the Arts (my friends Jan and Jim's newest venture) to have a print framed for my in-laws.  I know more about framing than I ever desired, but it should be quite attractive.

Trout and I went to the greenway for a ride late this afternoon.  We did 17 miles in 83 minutes (not too great for Trout but pretty good for me).  I feel exhausted and energized at the same time.  A great day.

"event","I was so disgusted with myself at my performance on my bike yesterday that I fixed us breakfast and headed to the greenway.  The only people out and about on a Sunday morning in the Bible Belt were runners and a solitary dog walker.  The morning was beautiful and I recorded my best time yet.  12.8 miles an hour (average).  I feel much better about it today.  

After my ride, I hit the stained glass class and bought 2 pieces of art glass for a project for a friend (a kitchen cupboard door).  Both pieces are blues and purples; I can't wait to get to work on it.  I'll have to post a picture to my glass community.

We went for a ride to Standing Indian and had a picnic at Hurricane Creek.  Cricket rummaged for food at the campsite and came up with white bread crusts and a piece of cheese.

"event","I got up early and went to help Tiffani with her car show.  She's in my Eng 12 Honors class and decided to plan and conduct a car show.  There were some beautiful cars--a total of 48 came, but I was most impressed with how well it ran.  Tiffani put a lot of man hours into organization and it showed.  It was a charity event for the Lions Club vision program (which provided eye surgery for her when she was a child), and she raised $1362.00.  I'm very proud of her and my other 6-8 students who came out as volunteers today.

Trout and I went riding this afternoon to the Cullasaja River Road.  Part of it is dirt and in a split second I was in the wet, muddy ditch and then on the ground.  I didn't get hurt, but the rest of the ride felt like I was pedaling in pea soup.  I don't know if it was a combo of today's fall and Thursday's fall down the stairs, but I could barely move my legs.  I'm quite disappointed with myself and know Trout wanted to go further the the 6 miles I managed.  I'm going out in the morning and try to make up for it."

"event","Well, I didn't get to excerise at all today.  I fell down our exterior flight of stairs this morning and did a number on my left shin.  I fell down these same stairs around 7 years ago, so I've been very careful on them since then.  Maybe tomorrow."

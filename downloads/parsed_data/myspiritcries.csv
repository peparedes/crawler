"event","You get to work, and you are actually happy to be there.  It is christmas and someone with a family is able to enjoy it.  Then bang your employer slaps you in the face.  They take away a big part of your morale for no reason,  they rip away one bit of your willingness to help out and work had for them.  God why must every job i have be so full of bullshit.  I work and work hard as i can and all i do is move backwards.  I finally get recognized enought o get my own set of keys to the museum.  Finally some recognition of my hard work.  SWEET. or so i thought until they take them away right away saying that people complained about a younger worker having keys so quickly.  So bang i am knocked down. Then to top it all off i get my check and hey the promise of making all these extra hours ""worth my while"" is... nothing ...no extra pay no raise no incentive of any sort...so fuck it...i give up....merry christmas to me and the walker art center can go to hell...
GRRRRRRR
after the holidays i am telling them the next time they need a person to fill in asap not to ask me.  Don't sigh me up for the double shifts like i have been doing.  I am no longer working holidays.  Nothing ...why should i ..i work my ass off for this place and all i get is a slap in the face...again and again and again.....
*sigh*...
why can i never find a job that appreciates me for my hard work and willingness to do whatever i am told...I am a good leader and can follow orders.  I do everything i am supposed to...but it is never enough....
everytime...just a slap in the face..
Merry christmas to me...And a slap in the face...*sigh*"

i got to chat a bit...but to no avail...i was hoping for a pick me up but all i accomplished in doing was crying...at work...i am broken...just a shell...i feel like a prisoner...i try to be ahppy but then nothing goes right...i am good person ...i think...
why must  i struggle to be happy....
i talked with perhaps my last best friend...she tried to help me...made me think alot..but my thoughts always slid into a darker region...even her words that used to bring me joy beyond compare ripped at my heart....the simple statements becoming shiverring spears of pain....she is such an amazing girl...able to handle anything...i wish i could learn that strength...
i can take anything and keep going...but i struggle to stay happy...the one person that i thought would somehow give me insights into myself..the person who knew me better then any other...could not help...so..what am i to do....maybe i do need a drink...
I need a hug...
i need so many damn things...and not one i can get...i need affection..i need attention...
i have waited ..been a good guy...and helped others..worked hard ...and moved steadily back....never forward...i invest years into people and i rarely see anything last...my friends screw me over..steal and lie and cheat...girlfriends cheat and lie...and even steal...what the hell has happened to this world...
so what do i do.....
i need something ....something
but what?"

"event","As i said in my last entry I am always thinking.  If you know me then you know it is true.  I think about things and i work out every possible conclussion and many times talk myself outta things rather then take a risk i realize is more likely to fail then succeed.  It is a bad habit.  But ironically i am still rebelious and love to take chances.  It all depends on my thought pattern for the day.
i think about things that involve my emotions alot more then anything else.  People really dominate my thoughts.  If i know friend or signficant other is in peril, whether it be emotional, physicalm, etc.  i think about them constantly .  I worry and try to help them, i risk all i can to help them.   More often then not i can atleast give them peace of mind.  I like to talk and listen to people.  It intrigues me.  So many different ways of viewing things.
People are fascinating.  I have found a few that keep me guessing and make me want to know them even more.  U know who you are.  *wink*
oh well...i am losing my mind again and my focus is drifting away...i am hoping someone i know hops on AIM and doesn't pop up an away message...Doesn't anyone stay up all night and work like me...
oh well i hope i get to chat later...i need a good talk right now...
until later"

"event","So it seems all might be ok in the world.  But then someone hits your car and drives away, But and this is the fun part, you are the overnight guard watching the camera and recording the asshole as they hit you.
          What the hell is wrong wih people, this world has no morals.  I have lost countless friends because of them using or abusing my trust. I place my faith and love in things, and believe that perhaps this person deserves it...I often question if any of them deserve it or perhaps if i deserve them.
        I watch this person hit my car and do about 2000 dollars in damage and drive off taking a good portion of my door with them.  As i record them doing this i get a terrible sick feeling in my stomach.  One of my prized possessions being slowly destroyed by inconsiderate people.  Who can i trust...
        I am starting to realize there are fewer and fewer people out there deserving of such a thing.  i have met very few peole that gave back as much as they took.  I strive everyday to try and make someone elses life a lil more cheerful, a lil more special.  But why?  Why use my energy on people that do not deserve it.  The people you willingly help everyday and then they never think that you yourself need help or support.  
     I wonder alot now who can i turn to, who is not going to use me and discard me.  It has happened so many times so why let it happen again.  But i do i still care for people that hurt me still let them play and tug at my heart strings, let my former friends that i knew stole from me be around me, open my home and possessions up for people to exploit.  
     I cannot count how many blows i have taken in my life.  and all i have is my quiet contemplations and now this journal.  I think it will become a very common thing to help me with things. 
     So what should i do keep, fighting this dark world filled with dark people and hope i can make a difference atleast in one person, or give up and look out for myself above all else...i seriously think that i have no choice in the matter.  I am stubborn and unwilling to give up on many things.  But i am so damn tired of being hurt.  Why must everyone you meet hurt you or use you for their own selfish gains?  
I guess it all comes from the fact that every light has it shadow, but now days it seems the lights are fewer and the shadows so much more ominous.....
til later"

"event","Well if you don't know me i work at the Walker Art Center, it is fun and exciting...yeah, right. It is fun though at times such as tonight.  A man fell into the water and got all wet and came into our lobby and started to remove his damp clothes.  NOt a pretty sight.  But we have had everything from breakins to nude joggers to men and women feelings themselves up or screwin in the garden..so lovely..if anyone could see more crazy people then me in an average day theymust attend or work at an asylum.  At least once a day/night some weird crazy/junkie/weirdo person swings by here.  And we are closed!!! i can hardly wait to see the nut cases once we open....oh well shall be fun..."

"event","Well today seems to have show a bit more promise and i like the fact that the world seems right.  Perhaps it is the lack of sleep and the hope in the new.  I have wondered when i could rebalance myself and find my center.  Now it seems it might be that much sooner. I have found a way to look at things that i never new existed.  With this new light to reveal my way perhaps i can recover from my strange thoughts and come through all this.  I had a good nights sleep, a hopeful sleep filled with good dreams, and as i started my 16 hour day today i felt great, i could try to place my finger upon what has changed in my life but i fear if i do i might be wrong and start believing in false hopes.  Consequently i am going to wait things out and see if anything comes abut that may be a clue or maybe a beacon to send me towards the right things.  but as i have always quoted and always believed, ""Dreams Are Born From The Death Of Reality.""
and nothing in my mind could be more true, let me know what you think......"

"event","So today is better.  Trial was just lovely..ha.. the guy got convicted though and now my name address and all that fun stuff is public knowledge so his friends can freely hunt me down as they please.  The District Attorney assured me that that is unlikely if not totally improbable to happen.  But you know, i still worry.  I do feel better in a way.  An old friend helped me forget my troubles for a few minutes tonight, i think sometimes that friendships created in your most desperate times are the strongest most resilient ones.  I just never feel like i have a permanent out though.  Maybe it is my own person that closes the doors to the possibilities..  Maybe i could learn alot still.  I am going to reevaluate my life a little bit and try to figure what my next step will be.  Maybe Seattle is not sucha bad option.  or maybe down south.  I am sick of the north,  too many bad memories and worries.  Oh well tomorrow is another day and hopefully someday soon i can close the door on this chapter of my life and move on....perhaps there is something out there worth searching for"

"event","It is a little over two months after the assault.  I was stabbed multiple times and now i must learn to deal with people again.  I have so few friends and even fewer people i can turn to and trust with these new and terrible pains and emotions.  I have a new way of thinking a new lifes outlook, one i did not expect to come til i was much older.  I know now i am not impervious that i can be killed as easily as everyone else.  I am not immune i am just another target i was his target and everyone elses that has hurt or used me.  I made terrible mistakes but none were severe enough for me to deserve this.  But i believe in the phrase that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  i know tomorrow may hold closure as he may be sentenced tomorrow but i fear that there may be repercussions to him being convicted.  I fear he may have friends at the trial, what then another knife in me or perhaps a more precise bullet?.. i have lost alot of confidence and alot of sleep.  i fear i may not easily return to my former outlook.  And with noone to help me..no friends...no confidants...i turn to my inner contemplations and scrutinize my soul..i think i may find answers there..i hope i can set myself straight again..the scars will remain upon my body but i cannot let myself be totally destroyed...i just wish i had somewhere to turn rather then inward...i hold no faith i others now..perhaps having faith in them was my worst mistake...
perhaps tomorrow will bring closure...
perhaps tomorrow will bring release...
*sigh*...i can only hope.."

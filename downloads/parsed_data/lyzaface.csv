Not the cutting of the grass,
Nor the destruction of a building.

No one can stop the emotions inside me.
Not the little child on the corner of the street,
Nor the president of the United States.

This is something that I own,
Something you cannot take away.
And that is that, but this is real.

Nothing can stop this feeling that I have.
Not the singing of a bird,
Nor the starting of a bloody war.

No one can stop the emotions inside me.

The power of this emotion,
Is something that I own.
It will not change and it cannot change.

"event","There's a force in this world that overcomes your body and you wont even know it until you get that assurance from another being. It builds up so much force and intensity in your innards even though you know that it's not possible for it to do so. Your body goes into small quick convulsions, your palms produce salt water, your heart beats quicken as if you just ran a mile in under four minutes, and your stomach spreads its wings and attempts to release itself by ripping through your flesh. Sometimes you find yourself starring at the smallest things and thinking about what they must feel and if they can feel this force as well. Or maybe you like to stare out into the sky and imagine seeing it transfer between the stars and shooting back into the crowns of another human. Or maybe, just maybe, you don't believe in it at all. You think it's something society created to develop healthy home lives and premarital sex. Whatever it may be, we all know it exists and it is captivated in the eyes and the bodies of the world. Now, I dare you to experience this force with no regrets. Can you handle it?"

I never understood why I wrote so much useless shit on this damn livejournal. No one reads it and its not like I need to be spreading my life like a virus across the internet. But I always find my way back here and end up spilling more and more useless shit into this fucking blog. so here I got again.

<center>I dont know if anything thats been going on is even worth it. I've been wasting my time everyday and doing absolutely nothing on my days off except seeing my boyfriend. Thats the only thing I've really done so far. My best friend is working all the time and is always with his girlfriend so its not like I can walk down the street anymore and chill with him. And all my other friends are too fucking far away in eastbumfuck falmouth or mashpee. This has been a completely uneventful summer. I need to break away, I need to get to boston at some point. I need to figure out shit on my own but I cant do it here on fucking cape cod, there's too many familiar faces. I wanna be in a crowd where no one knows anything about me and will just take me as I am. But that seems impossible. But its not like anything is gonna stop me from trying. If I try hard enough at something, I eventually get it.

I have a killer headache and I am NOT a fan."

I'm finally happy and finally fucking <b><u>over it</b></u>.
Thank fuck maan.
We hung out yesterday at his house for an hour and a half.
We just chilled and talked and laughed a bit.
It was good.
I'm glad we're friends. :)
I traded him my plaid pincher's for his drug rug
which I fell asleep in last night and just wore it today
because its so fucking comfy!
And I have it on right now actually.
I love this fucking thing :) haha.


But yeah..
I'm happy :D"

I wish changing the world would be so much <u>easier</u>.
Its so hard to impact such a large amount of people.
I guess thats why they have religion.
Like the reason for religion is to impact
a large amount of people to do good for the people.
Because one person cant just be like
<i>""alright we gotta make a change!
No more killin people, no more theft, etc and
its happening right now!""</i>
Because it just wouldnt work.
But still because of human nature not <u>everyone</u>
follows the rules to their religion or lack of one.
So the world is still messed up in some parts.

thats my preaching for the day.

""Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,"""

THIS MORNING</b></big><small>
last of math mcas.
I got so bored and sidetracked I ended up drawing
all over the test booklet and it looked so rad.
I got sad when I realized I couldnt take it with me :(
Then Ben and I left the study period and found chris and watched
a movie about guantanamo bay, cuba and ate cookies
then I put orajel on my lips and that was an exciting moment.
theeeenn me and brianna skipped english and then went off to field day.

</small><b><big>FIELD DAY</b></big><small>
water fight with livvy, linda, and matt.
linda poured a bottle of water down my shirt.
and that was the end of it really.
then matt and i went to the ""bathroom"" so we walked back
to school, peed, played ddr next door, i smoked a cigarette
then went back to field day.
then we watched the dunk tank action and I couldnt dunk someone for
the life of me. it just wouldnt hit the target
it kept going around it!!
thennn puck took his shirt off and we sang metal ABC's and other
fun songs. :)

</small><b><big>AROUND 2:30PM</b></big><small>
we were back at school and matt and i left to get some gelato
then we went to the green and had a massive grass fight
after he jumped out of a tree and smacked his balls on the way down
I hadda good laugh after that one :)
then we basically went home and I slept for 2 hours
and now im here typing on this fucking blog
about my day



<i>how charming.</i>"

<small>so basically.. Linda and I skipped the whole day of school.
We went to a cemetery for a bit and she hated the orange she was eating so she threw it on the grass and made awesome flower crowns for her and I. Then we walked to a beach by the marina where I went in the cold water up to my knees and then we wrote a message in a bottle and put our secrets in it and Linda got mad because I suggested that we use her Poland Springs bottle and she dumped out all the water. Then we went to another cemetery by a church on main st and laid under a huge pine tree and talked about such and such and I made a tee-pee out of sticks for her to live in. Then we met up with Matt at the marina and he informed us to go hide because the tennis team was going to nantucket so we ran behind some stupid tourist attraction. When he returned we fed the geese and one bit my finger.. but thats okay I still love it. And some creepy guy asked us to trade him 2 bucks for a bag of chips so he could get clams.. I dont know WHY so we did. Then after matt left Linda and I went to the mall via Bbus and we chilled in Barns and Noble for a tad and then we went to spencers and then we went to those photo booths that you get a strip of photos for three dollars. well we didnt have three dollars so we sat in there and took our own pictures :). then we waited for the bus to come outside the mall and it was 20 minutes late and that sucked. but all an all it was AMAZING <3

too many things have been on my mind. they pretty much consist of everything but the present. it's creating a total mind fuck for me right now and it's cutting into my goal of a fulfilling life. yeah i'm only sixteen but that doesn't mean i dont need to worry about living life to it's fullest, if anything i need to worry about that right now. all i can think about is this one person... when i close my eyes i see his staring back at me and searching my soul. i dont know if i'll ever see him again and thats what most bothers me. i've been realizing these things alot lately. he's the only person in my life that i had a deep connection with and never became friends afterwards. but i blame myself. the last thing i said to him in person was ""i love you, too"" (out of context) and i think i meant it..."

Well I made a move on the guy
that I like today...
and it went well.
<center>
but I have a feeling he doesnt want to tell
me that he <u>just</u> wants to be friends.
He said one of those: ""I like you alot but I dont know
if its in <i>that</i> way..""

I told him to figure it out while hes out of the country
and that we'd talk about it later.



but as for now.. I'm on cloud nine and optimistic about this.

I'm really starting to </small><b>HATE</b><small> people.
Just everything about us is so fucked up.
Not just our form and the reason we're on this earth,
It's the way we <u>express the reason</u> why we're on this earth.
At this age, being a teenager is just like being a blind
man in an art museum; life doesn't make any sense.
We think we ""<i>know</i>"" our surroundings and we think we've
found ourselves and that we're on the top of the universe.
Well we're obviously wrong.



There's people out there that CRAVE attention but dont want
to admit it to themselves. <b>Hopefully</b> they'll change in a
couple years and be like ""Fuck I was such a douchebag!"".
They search for attention in numerous ways but the most common are:

<b><u>1.</b></u> Lying their fucking ass off so people will feel bad for them. Like faking some sort of serious illness (cancer for example) or a serious drug addiction like heroine. These people also like to talk shit about others behind their backs and expect them not to get angry. Fuckers.
<b><u>2.</b></u> There's some people that I care about in my life but they go waaaay too fucking overboard with their actions. They try to make themselves as noticeable as possible as a sign of rebellion even though they know they look like absolute shit and are just trying to ""get back"" at their parents. And while they're telling you about how horrible it is because their mother wont let them wear makeup or nailpolish they dont realize that they could be talking to someone who has it five hundred times worse than them.
<b><u>3.</b></u> Sitting all alone away from their friends quietly writing in a notebook. People usually think that they really do wanna be alone but they really dont. They want someone to come over to them and ask them whats wrong. And after denying that nothings wrong about 5 times they finally make up something fucking stupid to say so the other person feels bad for them. Ridiculous? I think so.

</small><b>IF YOU EVER FIND SOMEONE WITH ALL THESE THREE CHARACTERISTICS... MORE POWER TO YA!</B><small>



And just the FACT that people make fun of their own kind for
""amusement"" or because they have nothing better to do sickens the fuck out of me.
Speaking your mind is a totally different thing.
If someone asked me what I thought of a <b>fucking stupid situation..
</small>I'd tell them that they're fucking stupid.</b><small>

<i>Getting back to the making fun thing..</i>
Its horrible for people to make fun of others especially if
that person cannot stick up for themselves.
Spreading rumors is another fucking thing that pisses me off.
</small><b>what's in a rumor?!</b><small>
All they do is fly around the school whispering in other's ears while
carefully sticking pins into a voodoo doll of the rumored person.
fuck that.


... I guess my rant is over, but I'll probably add alot more to this later on."

I. dont. know.
Him & I have changed <i>so</i> much
since our relationship ended.
We're <u>better</u> people than we were.
So we talked last night about a second chance
ever happening. It's been on my mind alot.
And he said he's thought of it also, just not as much.
I <b>know</b> I'm not ready for it, and he says he isnt
either, but shit, it could happen.
I acually really want it to happen.
I <u>still love him</u>, obviously.
The love just isnt as strong as before.
I mean shit, we were so immature back then
and we didnt know how to <i>handel anything</i> in our
relationship. But now we've both matured alot.

Now I <i>really</i> wish I didnt say <b>any</b> of that.

And then around 10 my dad and I went in there.
and I smiled at him and such and he didn't
seem too <b>uppity</b> considering I got no smile as

(That Dragon face is really fucking cute!)

So him and I are on good terms
which is pretty fucking <u>nice</u>
I hung out with him today for a bit
and it was <b>POURINGG</b>
aaaand he locked his keys in the car
AGAIN (apparently he did it yesterday, too)

But it was fun :)
<i>Great</i> actually.



Then when I got home Myk and Brian
wanted to have a movie fanaza deal
Soo I went over there and watched
<b>A CLOCKWORK ORANGE <3</b> with them
but all Brian did was talk to fucking <u>Jaki</u>
Ri-goddamn-diculous much?



<3 :)
I'm really happy."

He managed to hit a cement
flower pot twice.
<i>once</i> comming into the driveway
&& <i>once</i> going out of it.


We never went to the movies.
It's whatever. I dont really care.
At <b>least</b> I saw him :)

I'm starting to <u>feel</u> something.
The Problem is: I dont know if
that's a good thing. ""/"

Linda slept over the past
2nights. She just left :(

<i>Anyways,</i> Shit it was fun.
A little  <u>tooo</u> fun ;)
hahaha.




Last night was amazing.
Linda, Myk, and I went out to
<b>dinner</b> at BZ's and then
went to the park and went star gazing
until a fucking <u>JUNE BUG</u> crawled on my
shoulder, then we left and went down to
Sea street beah.
The moon reflecting off the water was <b>beautiful.</b>
<3.


Tonight, going to the movies
most likely.. with <i>him</i>

Shit happens for a reason doesnt it?
Well thats what I <i>think</i> anyway.
I don't really know how to start this.
I've felt like shit all day..


The outcome of the whole day seems
<u>pretty alright</u>.
which is good. I dunno I'm babbling
+ this isnt making any sence.


I <i>still</i> dont know what I want.
But I've realized that I'm going into
this without my feelings.
I havent felt anything really.
A couple <b>Warm Fuzziez</b>
But thats about it..
nothing that makes me smile non-stop.









We'll see what happens."

<b>LoopyLatkaxRevolution</B>

We found a little hut place
that was basically a square
box that was cut out of the old
<u>A&P</u> and we sat in there for
a bit. Lit a candle etc.



Then a little later on she
Poured <b>HOT</b> WAX all over
My tummy :( Haha it hurt a little.

Uhm, I dont know how to start this.
This guy.. who works at a place
down the street from me and I go
there often; He like <b>asked</b>
for my necklace and I gave it to him


Then like 10 minutes later I was like
""<u>WHY THE FUCK DID I DO THAT?!</u>""
But I'm not gonna go get it back.
He said he'd wear it <b>everyday.</b>


plus he's really fucking cute
and hes the guy that the below
entry is about.. hahaha.

"event","Wha? oh, right. I find myself idly staring, doing completely nothing lately. Perhaps that's because it's currently me and the cat in this house as Mom and Grandma are in Italy at the moment; another three weeks of that too.
Well I did clean up a bit in the kitchen and put out some trash and whatnot, watered the plants, feeding the fish every evening, cat wants attention too, etc.
Been at my other aunt's birthday party yesterday evening, managed to arrive far too early (7:00PM) and stay until 11:35PM.
I drank two beers >.> <.< it was cherry flavored with something like 4.5% alcohol in it?, not half bad really.. tasted good. I'm no beer drinker, let alone anything else except fruit juice or mineral water. It just doesn't have my attention. But my uncle offered it, and I thought i'd try it, so there. XD
Anyway, talking to people and having a bite to eat and something to drink gets you up to 11:35PM quickly, and I went home and managed to stay up till nearly 3:45AM x.O
That's bad because I can notice now i've only had 5 hours sleep XD baaaaaad.

So i'm going to bed in a few minutes, i'm just going to try and set up the breadmaker so i'll have some fresh bread this week to take to work and such. Then also, tomorrow evening I plan on cooking something proper to eat for dinner instead of these quick incomplete meals i've been having the past week. I already bought the chicken friday afternoon, so there's no excuse to not cook a decent meal this time. Perhaps this time I won't spill the entire can of seasoning into the pan like I did the last time. Spicy chicken flavored saltrocks anyone?

I did have other plans this weekend.. I should have researched data recovery software which I need monday, there's a heap of other junk I want out of my way such as this half-wornout computer I brought home from work, my Triops tank needs it's heater built, I have that desktop airco waiting in a box upstairs (halfway done! oooh *whap* ow..), some php programming work (the translator), aaaand.. there's also a layout I need to finish for my other journal.
You'd think I have my work cut out for me already, well.. guess again. XD

Monday.. I can't hardly wait =( it will be annoying, because those 16 laptops are NOT done yet. The software setup is full of bugs that will prevent them from working without a lot of manual intervention.. exactly the kind of thing the people at work are not capable of. Let alone understand >.>
The big cheese in charge at the location I work at rang me up friday urging me to have it done by monday. Well mister, you're out of luck, because I can't do a magic jig and have it working like that, it needs more work before it's done. I did warn them weeks in advance for that, but. anyway. Laptops =! Desktops, especially when they want them to be wireless and still be able to logon to the network whenever they damn well please..

Moooooooonday! christ.. i'm going to bed."

But it'll be the weekend soon I suppose, two days to recover and see if I can rid myself from lack of inspiration and motivation, because those two are uncool to have hanging around your person.

Almost had a fire in my server room yesterday afternoon, in the morning a maintenance man came to check on the emergency lighting installation for the ground floor, for which the large battery pack is sitting inside my server room.
So, just before he left he said he smelled a faint burn, but left anyway and apparently thought nothing of it.
Well as soon as he left, the fire alarm went off and the entire building was immediately evacuated. I ran downstairs to shutdown the servers and grab the backup tapes.
The entire hallway downstairs was smoked up with a light grey smoke that smelled of burnt laquer, I never did see flames though. Apparently what the mainenance man smelled, and should have seen when he was in there, was the power transformer inside the battery compartment that had shot and burned itself to death and produced all the smelly smoke.
In the end no harm done, but it could have been a potential fire hazard and if it did go bad, i'd have lost all 5 of my servers; including everyone's data that was saved up until the alarm went off, as my backups only run at night.

Mh.. more later. I miss people again.. dammit. it teh hard during work days! D:"

Friday already! time flies.. i've said that a lot lately >.>
Anyway. At work things are going so-so, basically i'm still short several pairs of hands and brains with all the junk that accumulated in my office before the vacation time started. So far i've managed to get 12 of the 21 available new desktop machines out of my way, and i'll try if I can get the other 8 out of my way today although i'll probably be stuck with some boxes until I can get new network wallports installed in some places x.o
Then there's that giant steel bunker on wheels with the 16 laptops. Unfortunately due to a lack of wireless support in Windows 2000, I have to use Windows XP and prepare the fileserver to receive a disk image based on XP.. that will probably take another week to accomplish, especially since coming monday the students will be arriving again.
I must also not forget to import all their names into the system today because monday will be too late XD;

So in not-work related news;
I've been rather hooked on a place called <A HREF=""http://www.secondlife.com"" TARGET=""_blank"">Second Life</A>.. I found it by chance and thought i'd try it, and i've gotten quite addicted.
Basically Second Life is a virtual reality simulator, and you create your avatar and can then roam through all available 'simulations'; a sim being for example the digital remake of your favorite town with everything in and on it.
It's possible to create virtually anything you know, see and hear in real life for use in Second Life, gestures, sounds, dance, furniture, houses, jewelry, clothing, you name it. There's even money, and believe it or not you can buy and sell your money from Second Life and exchange it for real money.
This being an incredibly large environment there's so much I can't name you'll find readily available.. what I think is a slight disappointment for me is the amount of sex you'll find in a lot of places. But i'm glad that there's a lot more places where you can simply relax and have fun and not be bothered with the explicit things, just like how you would be able in real life to choose and do your own thing. Freedom, basically.
What's nice is I seem to have gathered a small group of nice people around me rather quickly, I found that a bit surprising somehow but maybe I am too nice to people? lol XD

So, guess what my character looks like? i'll see if I can get a few screenshots in here later XD


My list for this weekend and the coming week:

1. Keep in touch with people! that means YOU - I miss you!
2. Update my game clients! (yes, ALL of them)
3. Reactivate accounts that have been shut off
4. Do more with the translator project
5. uhh.. there's more but I forget.. it's too early XD"

Just maybe an hour or so ago before I got out of bed, I was awake and looked up to the right lower corner of my window, and saw a small, entirely brown figure duck away. It was completely soundless and about the height of a 5 or 8 year old child.
Perhaps me seeing this apparition in my room had something to do with the thundering and rain going on at that moment, as i've had the distinct feeling i'm not alone in this house when there's thunder in the sky. That doesn't always happen, but it does most of the time."

"event","Iiiit's... saturday morning *checks clock* yes, still morning XD
I'm home again, must say not without some feelings of unaccomplishment(s) because I haven't actually done anything spectacular, nor did I execute most of my plans such as going fishing XD;
So, short recap. First few days, maybe 4 at most, we had one very scorching hot sun and no clouds in sight, all we did was sit outside and fry. Needless to say although i'm about to anyway; diddly squat happened during the heatwave although I did manage to unlock the boat and have it in the water for a test drive to see if it would still float. Being made of plastic makes it no surprise it still floats. XD
Then after those days, the weather kinda started to turn around and it got a little windy, then the rain set in and didn't leave until these very past three days with the exception of one or two days last week.
We did go out to the surrounding towns to visit the markets and do some shopping during the dry moments in between the monsoon-like showers we got up there, since being stuck inside a caravan all day isn't really the general idea of vacation.
I did spend a lot of time inside sitting at my laptop during the rain though. I guess it was the easiest thing to grab to burn time with XD
While messing around with that i've so far read up on building decent business type websites, personal websites, what the best way is present your content and why, what to consider when building navigation systems, what to do about digital media on your site, etc. Basicallly reworking my general knowledge of building for The Internet. I haven't finished the magazine yet though, but I will because i've got another project going from before the vacation started; building a secure server/gateway/router. I haven't decided what to call it yet, but either way I have the machine already and the software is waiting to be installed and configured.
I'll also be rebuilding my very first server from 2001, since the Yahoo Group that remained from the ashes of it burning down is starting to live up again and people are asking where the old familiar gathering should be resurrected again.
Back on track with the vacation story, read up on building websites, also read some articles about PHP programming and XHTML and stuff because I want to step away from 'old style' HTML, and.. i've completely reorganised my mailboxes over that cruddy 9.6k mobile phone line of mine during our little rain season.
I can tell you that relocating your mail and redoing all the folders on an IMAP mailserver can take quite a while over such a slow connection, and produce some very odd results. But it works now and I can receive mail once again XD
I'm going to cut this long story short. Today is saturday and monday i'm going to stop by my workplace to see if things are starting yet. If it's not, then I probably have a few more days left of vacation, although that's doubtful XD
There's some confusion about the ending date of this summer vacation somehow, but since there's a few appointments this coming week such as the dentist, we had to be home anyway.
Well, on to the next update~"

Anyway, friday night of the third week of vacation already. Time goes by fast, even when it's raining! and it has been raining for three weeks now.

You know, friday afternoon, last week when we went home for laundry/mail/etc. Mom and me saw a real, live Red Fox sitting in the grass just across a small stream of water from where I was sitting in the car! Ruddy red fur and black stockings on his feet and everything, classic image of a Red Fox. Pity we were driving on a highway though, else I would have taken a few pictures.
I did try to see if it would be there when we drove back to the campsite again but ofcourse it wasn't there at that particular moment. A Fox! rawr XD

Currently the weather is mostly on and off rain, but when it starts it pours for quite a while and then stops.. starts like a drizzle and then pours down again. All my solar powered garden lights are suffering from the lack of sunlight, 4 out of 12 can't bring up more than maybe 30 minutes or an hour of light before dying out from lack of stored power.
They're cheap lights, and those four are obviously not the best of the lot if they can't get enough charging power from plain daylight like the others seem to be able to do.. Ah well, cheap is as cheap comes I suppose.

In other news, I told myself I was going to go fishing this year at least <I>once</I>, but it hasn't happened.. yet. With the rain coming back every other half hour like it has i've been sitting inside mostly pecking away at some games on the laptop. Not surprising given how i'm such a computer addict =P but I was going to be somewhat productive anyway while in between games. I've made a small start on programming a web-based translator to aid in direct translations of texts in different languages.
My testing laguages will be the fantasy 'Drow' language and the English language, aaaand there won't be any spelling or grammar checking (yet?). Basically why i'm writing a translator is because I get fed up easily looking up stuff manually when it can be done a lot quicker with something similar to a searchable database or translator of some sort. Or you could just say i'm lazy. Either way when it's done i'll put it up somewhere online for people to use and complain about complete with source code. Good learning experience for the future? XD
The games luuuuuurk around the corner.. well, if it rains more tomorrow i'll just do some more programming and perhaps some other stuff.

Oh, remember this: Don't trust coin operated public showers. They'll eat perfectly good money without giving you your hot water. Or give your 'defective' coin in return, for that matter."

After dinner I went out with the boat to try out a sonar 'fish detector' in deeper water, just to see if it actually works and to see how deep the water is. I'm not sure the depth measurements of the sonar is accurate, but at the moment I really have nothing else to compare the measurements with so it'll have to do. I didn't find much fish with the sonar, but did see some pass by as I went past deeper ends of the water. Curious little device, this detector.

Something else that's odd; just 20 minutes ago my phone rang, so I ran to pick it up, but got hung up on. And since it was past 11PM I checked the number that called me, and it's some odd long number with a country code (+90) i'm not familiar with..
Checking that country code out <A HREF=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_for_international_direct_dial"">here</A> reveals that ""+90"" belongs to Turkey.
Now who would be trying to call me this late in the evening all the way from Turkey? I could actually think of one person, but he was an intern I had over a year ago and haven't spoken to since, so it's not entirely likely to be him accidentally or intentionally dialling my number.
Then again it could also be some scammer whom acquired my number through some illegal means and whom is now siphoning cash through my phone bill. Either way i'll be looking for suspicious activity in the next few days, and i've written the phone number down so I can check it against my next phone bill.

What else... errr.. I got disconnected 3 times before I could write this? lol XD
I'll check back later~ everyone be safe now, 'kays?"

I was up at 4:30AM this morning XD; not too pleasant.. because it meant having one's senses awake enough to be forced to go to the loo.
I'm going to go sit outside, and perhaps see if I can pry open the rusty lock on my boat so I can put it back in the water and use it for fishing this weekend.

I have to work the first and last week of the summer vacation, and i'm currently in the first trying to stay awake and cool enough to be able to think and do some work. Not that becoming more and more lazy in this heat is helping me with getting anything <I>done</I> actually, but hey it's tuesday and it rhymes for no particular reason.
Hmm.. what else? i've been binging on comics. I've finished <A HREF=""http://www.questionablecontent.org"">this one</A> and am waiting to see what the hell will become of Faye and Marty, i've also been reading <A HREF=""http://www.rocr.net"">this comic</A> which is about as odd as it gets - I mean come on, SOAP?, then there's <A HREF=""http://www.elfonlyinn.net"">this one</A> which is currently indescribable, you just have to read it because it's funny.

Madness I tellZ you!

Speaking of madness, I had stuff ordered through the mail. One item is a wireless optical laser mouse for the laptop, because I was getting sick of the 30 inch wire on that 'Microsoft Notebook Mouse' I bought with the laptop years back. Wires are sickening, especially when they are too short and curl up all the freakin' time!. Anyway, then there's the second box which contained the other Ducti Utility man-bag I wanted (The 'High Voltage' one), an orange german war helmet made of plastic (To be used either as a prop in comedy acts, protection from incoming projectiles in Halo: Combat Evolved, or as a salad bowl), and an LED Badge. I'm a geek, i'm allowed to buy odd items. Sadly they didn't send a badge but a belt buckle, and it also appears it's broken so i'll have to return it, which is a DRAG during summer holidays. Third package which contains the battery charger i've been drooling over the past few months had arrived, were it not for nobody being home to accept the package. So the little note in the mailbox said the delivery person would try again tomorrow.
If it weren't for the fact I can't hardly get anything useful from local stores anymore I wouldn't even bother to consider mail order, because to be honest all it gives you is headaches and worries. Will it arrive? when? will it be in one piece? what if it's broken? do I have to pay the return packaging? sod all that! it's truly more gratifying to walk back into a shop, slam the item through their greasy finger-smudged glass counter and yell ""THIS NOT WHAT KRUG PAID FOR!"" and tighten that tie just that bit more on the store clerk, because you're evil like that.
Now, back to reality; i've emailed for support on the stupid 'badge' and i'll just have to wait for the charger to arrive.
Also, seeing how my <I>second</I> LCD monitor is starting to go weird with hazy pink hues flickering and altering the good looks of my desktop, i'm probably also looking at a lengthy and tedious tech support experience with Samsung's consumer electronics division trying to get this damn thing either fixed or replaced.
G33k w0eZ! garr!

Meanwhile it's stinkin' hot and I just want to wake up in the morning and not have to worry about work for a week or two, because I am quite ready for some time off.. and I want to go fishing =/


On another note, I wonder why BellSouth is thinking I will pay my bill? it would make sense if I lived in a country where there actually <I>is</I> a BellSouth office and I actually <I>have</I> an account with them.
Hmm. you know those fake stock emails you get too? the ones that warn you about profitable stock options? yeah, those. That, and that one from 'BelSouth Online Bill' make me think; I could sweep around some of those emails myself, and then reap the profits from all the FOOLS that actually act upon those emails. I'd be filthy rich! but also tremendously burdened  head first into the boiling hot center of the planet by incredible loads of guilt for harvesting the stupid farm.
So don't try it at home kids!

Anyway enough folly for now, i'm going to drown the LCD pinkness out by scaring the noobs with my flimsy plastic german helmet in Halo yelling ""j00 w3r3 Pwn3dZ0rZ by t3h ORanG3 ju1c3 g3stap0!"" (and getting totally killed while typing.)"

I'm ready for it, yup. I kinda need to find my balance point again though. I used to have more energy than I could spend in a day and that has changed to having less than I can spend in a day, so that's not good.
Key is to refrain from staying up too late and create a better pattern during this coming summer vacation I suppose? XD;
Well anyway, we're going out to the caravan again this evening, and see if we can't burn to a crisp doing diddly squat! yes, zip, nada, nothing. No weeding or other cleaning whatsit or other, just sun, chair, nothing.
It's likely to be too hot to be doing much anyway since it's supposedly going to be a very warm weekend, today the temperature is already hitting the 80F~ again, so..
I'll take my NDS + Brain Training game with me so I don't get sloppy and miss a day's training. XD;
You know.. they're showing ads for that game on tv here now. I honestly can't remember when Nintendo last had any ads out on tv o.O

"event","Already?? yes.. week's worth of tiredness + one lightly grazed eyeball + eagerness for exploration makes I should be in bed and up at a decent time tomorrow morning.
My eye is doing better after being assaulted with hairs, still kinda feels like it's been treated with sandpaper right above my iris, but that will heal overnight just fine, it just needs rest. Next time I need to be more awake before I rub my eyes!
As for the eagerness, that's because I received word yesterday afternoon that the Nintendo DS Lite arrived, and that I would be able to pick it up today. As I didn't really order one, but rather requested notification of it's arrival in Europe that seemed kinda odd.. but I went to the shop today anyway so I could have a look.
It comes in black and white versions and look rather sleek with it's rounded corners and all.. I got to hold a white one so I could check it out up close. I also asked if I could see the black version but at first the lady said there weren't any black  units left even though their stock listing showed 1 black unit available, so I told her 'well in that case.. I can't make a choice right now.' and put the white one back on the counter. After some odd fiddling between two of the sales ladies suddenly the only black unit in the entire store turns up, one of the junior staff was about to put it in the glass display at the back of the store. X3;
The black one is just.. gorgeous. It's pitch black shiny, double screens with backlight, stereo speakers, wireless, professionally irresistible.. So um, yes, I bought it. Along with 'Dr. Kawashima's BRAIN TRAINING - How old is your brain?', because I saw that one advertised on TV and it looked perfect for attempting a recovery of my perforated brain! and it's a really pleasing game despite being difficult and mind-bending at the moment. For example Dr. Kawashima's BRAIN TRAINING includes the Sudoku game, which has me going in circles despite the fact it has only 3 rules! i'll figure it out eventually.. but not tonight X3

"event","And it's weekend again.. i'm still home this time however. There were plans to get out again and go to the caravan but it's been set aside for family stuff, so I guess next time.
Meanwhile this week's been somewhat uneventful, the weather's awkwardly wet and cold-ish again, but I suppose that's to be expected right after such hot days. Work has been busy as usual, had two deliveries of 16 new laptop computers and the accompanying steel carrier closet on wheels that was part of the order.
You could say that wheeled closed is the vault for the laptops, it has two locks on each door and is entirely made out of relatively thick steel. I can just about look over the top of it if I stand on my toes, and is that thing heavy!, it took a janitor and me almost 40 minutes to get that thing off of it's wooden pallet they delivered it on because we don't have a bloody forklift at school.
Nevertheless, it's unpacked and up in my office right now taking up the entire area in front of my door until i've put all the laptops in there with their chargers and made it into a nice package for the students to maul and demolish at the school's expense.
I am going to be one angry monkey if even the *slightest* problem arises from people using the contents of that carrier and I will have the head of the person responsible if there is a problem, because this is the most bloody expensive set of kit I have in my posession at the moment. How much? I can buy a farking classy BMW if I sold the lot.

Less on the work side and more on the personal side my brain has been tormenting me with memories again. Such is the nature of the beast, memories come and go. I just wish for some i'd have opportunity to renew some memories related to a particular person who's no longer in my life with something more positive with someone else some day. And stop dreaming about her and the potato she ran off with. Seriously, why I dream of him lately I have no idea because it's pointless.
Looking at girls when I happen to be out and about also seems kinda pointless because most are at least 8 to 10 years younger than me, or the ones that <I>seem</I> close to my age have a ring on their finger. 26 seems to be a rather odd age to be single, I was wondering tonight. Or maybe i'm just living in the wrong part of this country or something.

Hmm.. you know those 16 laptops are tempting since my own is behaving rather flaky lately, but nah. It's just software problems though, i'm just too lazy to reinstall Windows again. Which, incidentally, i'm not going to. It will run much better on Linux, i've tested that so often I should have installed that ages ago. Perhaps something to do the next weekend.
I'm also craving to draw. I've said that so often it's becoming sickening, I have my materials within arm's reach, but there's this tiny fear demon that keeps rearing it's ugly head breaking my concentration. I can't draw with people around if the mood isn't right for it, nor can I get myself to sit still and focus without fussing over mistakes and style.
My head hurts, I think i'll go sleep and figure something out tomorrow X3"

My body can't keep up with that fast a change in weather from cold to hot, what's up with you Mother Nature? revenge upon the mortals! arrr, yes.
But anyway, if this kind of weather stays constant i'll adjust soon, and I gots me a mini fridge on my desk so i'm good (when I put something to cool in it, d'oh!).
On that note, did I mention it's hot? yes at work too dammit! I had the window open wide and the door open, and the three hallway windows open as well just to keep the hot air out XD
Oh, and apart from fridge fillings I also need to keep an eye on the fluid level of my desktop computer, because in this heat it's not impossible to run it to a dry boiling point o.O;

Umm... what did I do again.. I can hardly remember, must have been important then *scratches behind one ear* I worked, and?.. oh wait, yes. I saved a small bird out of one of the flower pots in the back yard on tuesday. It's one of those newly hatched small birds that can hardly fly, and somehow it managed to fall into that pot which had some water in it. Poor thing was shivering it's tailfeathers off. Gave it to Mom and she put it up in one of our trees so it could sit there with the rest of the birdies. Funny though none of them fled when we came close, which is kinda cool considering we're incredibly large creatures in the eyes of those birds.
Yesterday I helped Grandma with some stuff she needed to be done in her back yard, hanging up the flower basket wall-hooks and stuff like that.
On another note I wasn't around this saturday and sunday because we needed to go fix up our caravan and bring some stuff over.
I did some weeding around the caravan also, with an electric weed eater. I had some short encounters with plant juice and bits of fiber jumping up from the weed eater onto my clothes and face, and also one snail. Snail matter is very gross. Yes. I took a shower just now to get it off my person.
Saw some parts of Bicentennial Man just before I went to shower. I think it's a great movie, but then again i'm partial towards Robin Williams because I think he's a great actor =P

I've done diddly squat for my projects lately as well. I have had my sketch material out and dusted off but I couldn't hold the thought of reviving some of the ideas i've been having on paper. Cat died, cried, can't get used to the idea she's gone. I'm feeling out of sorts and there's this unaccomplished feeling nagging at me. I want progress and i'm not getting it, and that's frustrating. I'll have to work on that myself though, won't get it sitting around. But it's still nagging.
Haven't spoken to people in a while being that tired out of work =/ where am I?
Won't be home sunday for moral obligations. So much for the weekend. Monday I will be officially 26 years old, I still have to go out and get something for the folk at work, even though I might not be around to sit with them on break anyway. Haven't done that in a long time anyway either, too much stuff needs working on so I don't even bother to come out of my office anymore because it's inconveniant and interrupts work.
I need to free up time for my drawing board and get those sketches out of that dried up brain of mine, seriously. And pay bills, yay bills! not. >.> though my salary will be in soon after i'm done paying bills.

Edit:
You know, this will sound weird. But I just accidentally tripped on that cat. I felt it on the top of my right foot.. Now Mom is crying again."

I come home from work and that's it, completely knackered falling apart after sitting down at the desk. Yet I end up falling asleep at midnight and wake up at random times during the night. I wish I could sleep like before again, deep energy-rich sleep. It's like i'm on full alert 24/7. Wish I could discover why, it can't be the kids because I don't have any, wish I did. Then it would feel fulfilling.
I'm feeling uneasy. There are restless feelings again that I can't place.
Maybe the restlessness has something to do with one of our cats having trouble breathing :/ Mom will take her to a vet tomorrow because that poor cat can't live like this, she has to be able to breathe normally again. I hope it is easily cured. I wish for it.

Need to retrieve my mail soon before my box overflows :'( haven't been able to have the laptop which holds my mail online because my ISP wants me to test the modem without a router in between. Which means I can only use the desktop for now.
I'm going to cut the damn test first thing tomorrow. I'm sick of it, without the router everything suddenly just works. With the router the connection starts to drop out. I was doing just fine before their bloody upgrade to 6Mbit.
Damn cable internet provider is giving me the runaround as well. I have reasonable doubt their recent 'upgrade' introduced a flaw that interferes with my not-so-old wireless router, bringing the whole shebang down at random intervals. That helpdesk employee was rather quick to mention the router being at fault. He didn't have the full story yet because he interrupted me a few times. I'm now rather bent on cornering them with cold, hard facts. Just have to gather enough evidence I suppose. Or try to ditch them for another ISP. Either way i'm losing money on it. Funny thing is I thought I was the only one who ever had this problem. Turns out several people from different countries have had similar problems with the exact same hardware, same modem, same router, same connection dropouts. My ISP denies it's their fault, then how come when this combo shows up, there is a problem?

I have to get going again.. it feels like this weekend never really started before it already ended."

"event","I'm back~ finally, I might add.
I finally received the most important parts last friday afternoon, but I couldn't get very far because I had to be a dork and integrate those parts with the cooling system I had installed previously. Which left me with a bit of a problem because the existing equipment has a tube diameter of 8 millimeters, and the new equipment has a tube diameter of 12 millimeter. So I figured to connect both tubes together and be water tight on the seal, I needed tube clamps. But on a friday afternoon everything closes around the time I get home and that package arrived. Fun, but not. Then saturday was, what we call it here, Queens Day. Basically it's the queens anniversary which means everything is closed and people celebrate all over the country. So no tube clamp shopping on saturday, and naturally also not on sunday, so on to wait for monday afternoon when shops open again. Got two tube clamps, and they were no good because I couldn't get a water tight seal with those..
After a lot of thinking and messing around, I ended up using iron wire to wind around the seal and fasten it into a water tight seal.
I haven't had any leaks in about 3 hours so I put the computer back together and back on the desk in it's old spot again, this time with it's new companion external radiator+reservoir (called 'Reserator' according to Zalman Tech. from Korea).

So far no new leaks or faults, it's doing a great job cooling everything and it seems it's even a little more silent than it was before.
Now to catch up with everybody again and make something of what remains of this week, since it's vacation time. After this week, back to work and all that which makes life busy.."

Yesterday when I was riding home from work, up at some point a few kids say age 10~13 were riding in front of me on the bike road, and taking up the entire width of the road. So I ring my bell as I come up behind them, and instead of paying attention and going back to the right side of the road behind eachother where they belong, they don't even look up and instead ring their bells back at me. At that point i'm too close and hit the curb with my left bike pedal. Now it's bent, and according to the guy I spoke at the bike shop, he won't re-tense it into it's original shape because it's made of aluminium. Instead, it has to be replaced with a new one. Great. another cash hole I could have avoided.

Also on friday, I accidentally stepped on one of our poor cats tail. I really really don't like hurting animals, because it hurts me too, and he's getting old which isn't making it any better either if something breaks. Luckily his tail is bruised and intact instead of broken.

So up comes saturday morning! what do I find? I go sit in front of the computer as I do every morning, and turn on the monitor and tip the mouse a little to revive the computer from screensaving mode. Nothing happens. I check the display on the front, and the pump, fans and sensors appear to be working.. is it the monitor? Nope. Is it a lockup on yet another poorly written program? Nope. I hit the reset button, and the computer's BIOS replies in a clear female voice over the speakers, ""System processor failed.""

Excuse me? what the hell do you mean failed? I hit reset again and now even the voice is gone. So anticipating for having to replace the processor Mom and me go from dropping off some old furniture at the community dump to where I work and pick up two processors that might work, a cooling fan and a new power supply.

You know what I discovered on our way to work? ONE OF MY FRONT TEETH GOT CHIPPED. There is a freaking corner missing from one of my front teeth! I can't believe this, I really can't.

Now back to that computer, what did I find when I opened it? the liquid cooling system had leaked from the copper heatsink onto the graphics card because the nozzles on the heatsink cracked!. Thank you, another cash hole. I am so happy now, I really am so happy, if the card proves to be useless after I clean it, and if the system processor is indeed dead as well, I can just kiss the setup goodbye because parts for the socket type that's on this mainboard is becoming as rare as spotted dodos because of the change in mainboard architectures the past two years, meaning that if I want to replace one part but can't get it for this board, I end up having to buy an entirely new board, AND a new graphics card that works with it, AND a new processor that fits, AND new memory. Now, if I CAN salvage the card and the processor actually still works, all i'm going to need is new coolant and a decent heatsink made entirely of metal. I'm sure as hell never going to buy a two part heatsink that has a plastic top on it ever again.

And I still haven't had my cable Internet repaired because of how things are going lately with the exam period at school, I can't get away for a few hours without people flailing their arms screaming bloody murder because they couldn't listen to me when I warned them to not use 3.5"" floppy disks because they FAIL, I had to tell them TWICE afterwards when it was too late.
Each time I start to do more than just a few emails or a bit of surfing, I lose the farking connection. Sometimes up to an hour or more if the cable modem decides it's time to go into connection la la land.

I have to go again before I get knocked off.. but i'll be back, just you wait!"

"event","Seems my Internet connection is in need of repair, according to my ISP. Surprise, surprise - just a few weeks ago I was one of the very last lucky sods in this country who got their connection upgraded for 'free' to 6.3 megabit by the local cable monopolist - but unsurprisingly as with every time they touch their equipment in any way, it fails somewhere and customers like me are left with a dysfunctional cable connection. Their excuse was 'there is indeed a signal problem', and to alleviate the problem I am required to make an appointment with a repairman by phone. Great, but the net gets caught here. It's Easter, and the college I work for is right in the very start of the final exam period, and I am required to be present because the exams are done primarily on the computers we have there. So that leaves no room for an appointment with a repairman, unless by some chance he actually can come after 4:00PM, something I doubt but hey, i'll try shifting some mountains?

Meanwhile the clock still ticks on, I still have work to do before tuesday and tomorrow there's another birthday party. I haven't even touched MSN much lately either, and Yahoo hides two middle aged females of which one is by the signs of it trying to be seductive by asking 'send more pix'. No, dammit. I'm kinda annoyed with how life is silently slipping by me? socially speaking the past few weeks have been quite bland like everything has withered and died around me. On that note, I have been away from the desk a bit more than usual to try and settle my mind, doing other things like attempting to locate a strange problem with one of my solar battery chargers which makes it fail to notify when the batteries are done charging, but that's.. just. oh well.

I've started to sketch up the design sheets for the android's arms. So far I have the simplified view of the upper arm done. Kinda aiming to finish the arms this year but that kite will probably not fly that soon. I'm going to need more material for building the arms and especially start on the torso, since I need that to attach the arms to and also more importantly for considering inner size, and mechanical issues like weight, tension, battery size, onboard computer size, the shoulder joint and such matters. Even though i'm using aluminium, this is going to be a rather heavy machine."

Kinda hoping they would stop down the street so I could return it to them, Mom and I walked on. And actually the car was there so I told the driver, an elderly man, he lost something. He went ""Oh? oh, I did hear something"" and looked down to see one of his hubcaps was missing. So I walked back to pick it up for him and returned it. The couple (his wife was there too) was grateful. So that was cool.
And phillies, yes. Young mothers with their kids walking down the street in spring is a pretty sight.

Remind me not to ever buy 'solar cell parts' again. The description is as misleading as the contents of the package. In fact the contents is indeed in pieces; shards of broken cells which are absolutely useless without the proper tools to cut them down to usable shapes (they can only really be useful if you cut off the 'dead' parts that don't make contact with the rest of the cell), and it doesn't help when these things are as thin as a piece of paper and sharp like glass either. After an hour of fiddling with several different types of tools I found that while a diamond laced cutting disc is actually the most effective tool, it's also too bloody effective without decent stability, something a hand holding a small power tool can't provide. I have three very tiny solar cells left over from trying, the rest is in dust and splinters all over my room."

Got a few things to do this weekend, (which is starting early due to Good Friday) like two birthdays spread over saturday and <STRIKE>sunday</STRIKE> monday. Tomorrow is shopping day for housey type stuff, I got some stuff that's worn and needs replacing apparently.
Ummm... oh and I bought aluminium for building the android arms I have been planning for some years. One thick 'U' profile for the upper part of the arms, and one smaller 'U' profile that fits inside the bigger one to construct the lower part of the arms with, and possibly form the hands and fingers with in case I have enough material to last that far. I might have to get more steel wiring though for controlling the movements in the limbs. And I still have a list of loose parts I am going to need that haven't been ordered yet.

Haven't stopped thinking of her. I try not to think of her, but every now and then something just reminds me. Lately it's been every day again. You know, there's even stuff in there up in those grey cells that when it drifts to the surface again, it triggers a smile or even a sexual tinted thought. But most of it is frustrating, because most memories trigger what i'll call a virtual conversation; you engage in conversation with someone even though that person isn't there at all, but you get their reaction in every last detail - all up in that heap of grey cells. Now the trick is to get it to stop, or at least lessen to a degree where it won't continuously drain vital energy from your body with the voices whispering 'what if this' and 'what if that' till it does eventually disappear and doesn't require constant distractions, so will you shut the f*** up already, brain? My bed is empty, there is nobody  next to me when I wake up in the morning, nobody to take out kiss hug fondle or chase around just for fun and it's been more than a bloody year already that it got torn apart and me beating my head in frustration sometimes when you insist on barfing up the wolf in sheep's clothing I so put my heart and soul into. I'm done already, I want my ability to concentrate back so I can be creative again and I want to stop waking up in the middle of the bloomin' night wondering why the hell I woke up or wake up in the morning feeling like I never slept at all, instead of staring I want to be active again!

The problem with this is, it's a wireless connection. So now I have to dig out that farking UTP cable again and see if it also happens when I use a wired connection, and the next step, without a router.

Waiting for glue to dry is bleh. Yesterday I glued an aluminium cooling block onto the lid that seals the coolant tank for my desktop airco, and this morning when I checked it it tore off easily. So much for the new expensive glue I bought last month. Silly as I am i'm trying again with the same glue because it's like silicon kit, it stays flexible. This time the idea is to not test the strength of the bond, but to move directly on to attaching the peltier element and the other aluminium cooling block onto that and bolt it together permanently. that way it won't get a chance to tear again and the glue will act as a kind of rubber seal. anyways, enough blabla."

"event","The time issss... 11:22PM as I start writing this, and i'm pressed for time already and my alarm won't even go off until 6:45AM. bwargh. I spent the last three hours of my already monotonous (monotonous.. MONO to NOUS.. sounds like latin for a single mouse or something, what? oh sorry) weekend killing 570 processes of Gvim because I had to be smart and open up over 570 HTML files in separate Gvim instances. If you want to know a quick way to completely use up every last drop of your Microsoft Windows based system's resources, that's <I>the</I> way to do it. You're guaranteed to spend a few hours cleaning up the mess in case you're as vorpal as me sitting there trying to kill off the dead processes with the crippled yet somehow useful task manager. God, what I would have given for the ability to just hit CTRL+ALT+F1 for a clean terminal logon screen so I could have killed them all in one swipe. Thank you once again, Mr.Gates, for your efforts to make computing a wizard-driven hell. Opening large binary files with notepad is more fun than this.

So much for the ranting bit. Anything else? Ummm.. i'm.. i've actually not done anything this weekend.. i'll have to get back to you on that one X3; *runs*"

"event","Not quite how I pictured my saturday, waking up at 7AM feeling sick to the point where I had to get up and find some Advil. I don't mind being sick most of the time but it can be pretty annoying I can tell you that. Shivering my day away~ makes me feel like i'm in a 24h marathon or something.
Anyways. Other annoyances from the past two weeks include a bill from DHL Express - two weeks after receiving my package from ThinkGeek - stating I owe over $48.97 in customs fees, roughly 70% of the total amount I spent at ThinkGeek, for which I already paid $29.30 to have DHL ship it. I have never in my life paid customs fees before for overseas packages, and they claim the 'rule' was made in 1999 and applies to anything of $24.39 value. The $48.97~ is going straight into the pocket of our friendly tax man, who had absolutely nothing to do with the entire shipment process. Talk about -really- easy money, dammit. I am going to contact the tax office and give them a piece of my mind about it next week probably. I really don't feel like paying over 70% tax for something I ALREADY paid VAT and shipment on. Seriously, it's in the top 10 of things that make life as disgustingly impossible as possible for hardworking citizens. I think that if I add it all up at the end of the year what I pay in tax for god knows everything except the air I breathe, I could have bought return tickets to every country I want to visit and LOOT the farking stores AND come back having money left over!.
And why are there no available women my age with a mindset similar to mine on this planet? I'm cold.."

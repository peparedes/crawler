"event","So, what a crazy past week or so. Two weekends ago was a Wyvern weekend, in which i debuted my new character. it was fun, but so blisteringly hot that I wasn't able to be as in character as i'd have liked. After a weekend of near heat stroke, I had the week to relax, recover, and get super excited about the weekend after. i drove down to Royersford (yes, it doesn't really exist) to see the play that my friends Deirdre and Dara were in. Both were extraordinary, and the play was incredible. I learned a good number of things that night as well, such as what esoteric means, I have a long lost friend in Royersford whom I never met, people who live 15 minutes outside of Royersford have never heard of it, people in Royersford have no idea when or where a play is going on, always ask for the name of the place you're traveling to, Dara makes some damn good pancakes, Deirdre has one of the most beautiful smiles I have ever seen, McCarthy Flowers is open late, my CD player doesn't work on batteries, only AC power, I can be gregarious if I try, and my haircut is actually adorable

After that lovely trip, I spent the next week working on a gift to Wyvern staff - Settlers of Corsotha - with RJ. It was a pretty cool bondign experience, and the final product was rather impressive. This was debuted at the Wyvern Rising picnic this weekend, which Deirdre couldn't make it to, which didn't surprise me, but was still a little saddening. But I brought Mark, and it was a great time. Laser tag, Defend the Keep (almost literally), and good friends all weekend long for one last hurrah before the summer died. And I must say, this was probably the best summer I've had in years. Royersford proved a respectable road trip, and I had a grand time this summer. Now, I'm back in school, and I start classes in like 10 hours. No one hung out with me today, which made me sad, but I got to campus later than most, and everyone had plans which was understandable, so i think that I shall just go to bed. w00t for updates!"

"event","he African Serenghetti, Kenya, mid-July, The peaceful water buffalo wallows the remainder of a lush watering hole, now just a mud pit. Intent on simply keeping itself cool with a thick cake of mud to protect against the heat, it can afford no attention to its surrondings. A deadly error. The tall grass hides the predators, but they are there. Chirping and barkign to eachother as they circle their kill, the jackals move in, circling aroudn their pray and growing closer and closer. The poor water buffalo's horrendous sight offers it little help, and the predators are too adept at staying downwind to be smelt. The cicada buzzes loudly in the still hot air, frowing out all other sound to create an eerie monophonic chill. The entire plain is completely still for one fleeting moment. Then, the ambush. The alpha jackal leaps out of the grass and lunges at the neck. It establishes a decent hold with its jaws, but the water buffalo is huge, and able to shake off the small predator. However, as soon as it manages to kick one off, thee are already on its back. The water buffalo desperately thrashes, callign for help,but the rest of the her has moved on. A lone sow watches on and one by one the jackals nip away at the flesh of the mighty beast, until 15 minutes later the water buffalo collpases from exhaustion and bloodloss in the summer heat. The jackals,small as they are, have used teamwork and brutal savagery to bring down a prey that individually they could not hope to conquer.


That was work today. A larger update in the future."

"event","I just got off the phone with Skye...and I somehow feel wonderful. I feel connected again. We were talking for quite a while, unstressed, unobligated. It was quite...rejuvinating. Nothing significant was talkeed about mostly. The beginning was heavy, yes, I sit corrected. But it's nearing 11:11, and I want to make my wish. This is just a machine, it doesn't matter if I type it. I wish that moods liek that could be captured in a bottle and kept. I wish that it will stay that good. I lied it. It felt good. :) It's times like this i really think things are saved. I need to stop thinking when i'm tired, it doesn't do any good.

In other news, karate lessons started today! Woo hoo!

9 months was two days ago. :)

I've begun writing again, more fantasy, more pretending i'm an author! Woo hoo!"

"event","Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June

But tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the milky way
to see the lights all faded
and that heaven is overrated
Tell me did you fall for a shooting star
one without a permanent scar
and did you miss me
while you were looking for yourself out there.

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-bo
reminds me that there's room to grow
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
plain ol jane told a story about a man
who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
and head back to the milky way
And tell me did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
and did you miss me
while you were looking for yourself out there

Can you imagine, no love, pride, deep fried chicken
Your best friend always stickin up for you
(even when I know you're wrong)?
Can you imagine no first dance
freeze dried romance
5 hour phone conversation
The best soy latte` that you ever had and...me?

But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?
did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the milky way?
Tell me did you sail across the sun?
did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded
and that heaven is overrated?
Tell me did you fall for a shooting star,
one without a permanent scar?
and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself
nanananananananananananana

and did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?
nanananananananananananana

and did you fall for a shooting star?
fall for a shooting star?

nanananananananananananana
and are you lonely looking for yourself out there?

It's been seven hours + thirteen days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night + sleep all day
Since u took your love away
Since u been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues,

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 u

It's been so lonely without u here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop this lonely rage
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl u better have fun
No matter what u do
Cause it's the blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 u

All the flowers that u planted 
In the back yard suga
All died when u went away
I know that living with me baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to try, said I'm willing to give it another try.

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 u

Why is it these songs sound so good right now?"

"event","Ho hum. What a lesson in humility this has been. I never realized how obnoxious and power hungry I was until I was placed into the position were if I try to assert myself, it will all fall to ruin. I never really realized how much say I needed in a situation before,  and I think back about how so many times I threw myself into the middle of things like i'm some heroic knight in shining armor, intervening, coming up with a solution, and saving the day. It's all been so unfair to you, I wish i realized was i was doing long ago. I'm so sorry.

I believe in you now. I know you can do this. Just find it in you to forgive me for realizing this too late."

But anyhow, finished summer assignment the morning they were due...oh yes, school started. An interesting year, or so it seems. Good classes, decent people in them....no Skye though, although we're beginning to figure out where we are a bit more, and when we'd be at our lockers and in the halls, so it's beginning to work out. I'm getting annoyed quickly with how much people are saying I look like Jesus though. I wouldn't go so far as to say sworn enemy, but definitely not someone i have interest in looking like. *sigh* My birthday was yesterday! yay! Lord of the Rings DVD from family, Tabitha's Secret CD from Skye. Two wonderful presents. :) Meh, way too distracted to further this. Maybe later. i doubt it too. New chair, keyboard and mouse. i feel so uncomfortable."

"event","Hello again! I decided i should update this, as i actually did something today! and that would, i went over the wonderful Skye's today! We worked on my summer assignment, because she's such a wonderful person. we got the hard part done, which rocked! It looks exactly like I hoped it would, thanks to her savvy for the most part. I can't thank her enough. :) So now, just cards to make. And so, despite getting that done, we still had a wonderful time. I really think I treasure my time with her more than life itself, because my time with her is larger than life. Ahhh, that sense of completion. I can be a somehow cynical person at time, but it's nice to be able to be some place where everything just seems right. the simplicity of being in her arms, solving all the wrongs in the world. Imagine that. 

In other news, that essay will probably not occur until school starts, as i have bigger fish to fry and then realize I don't really like fish. 

On that note, i'm out of here. Time to make like a tree and leave, before I get stumped on what to say. Perhaps if could get my writing skills to branch, my bark would be as potent as my bite. Maybe my problems are deeply rooted in me being such a sap. Thank you, thank you. You're all too kind. I'm here every Tuesday and Thursday, 7-9. Try the meatloaf!"

Probably what's marring that though is how much I miss Skye. See, Hollie went back to college today. So I have no idea when she's getting back, but I would imagine she should be back soon. :) Other than that though, there hasn't been an incredible amount going on. And as this is large ramblings about nothing, I think I should conclude. Maybe get started on my senior project. :p"

"event","Salutations, and welcome to my LiveJournal! My hopes and aspirations for this are to keep a somewhat daily recording, expressing events, thoughts, ideas, and anything else that (hopefully) flows from my fingers. All of this is in hopes that at any point, i can look back and reflect upon a written record of my triumphs, defeats, and mediocrities; perhaps through observing a change over time in my opinions. That, and i need something to do on-line when Skye isn't on. :O)

That being said, I suppose there actually has to be some sort of journal entry for today. Well, today was entirely defined by Skye coming over, and it just being as wonderful as ever. I lost on Jeopadry, baby. :( :p Just the same, what an incredible day. :) Now, with the rest of the day to myself, I'll probably just be Everquesting.

I suppose I'll end this with a teaser...COMING SOON! ESSAY ON HYPOCRISY OF AMERICA! KEEP CHECKING!"

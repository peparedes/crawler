This summer has been pretty cool i spent a week in spain and went to valley fair. I'm goin to State Fair this weekend, which'll be cool. My sister Jessica is going to have her and Matt's baby on the 17th. It's a boy and his name is Nathanial. I'll just call him Nathan, the baptism is on the 28th. We're having a family get together the day before and we're going to burn the bon fire Denis and I put together this week...our arms are tired from running the chain saw and pulling branches.  I'd invite all of you, but it's just family. anyway, um..i start class on the 29th, which will suck..i hate school.

Well, i must skidattle, so i shall talk to you all at a later point in my life, hopefully not too far from now. well see what happens.

Adios!"

NO I'm not pregnant.

NO I'm not engaged.

YES I am mad because here I am, not saying anything mean about anyone and minding my own business when people around me, including people i would have previously considered friends, start all kinds of rumors about me and my personal life. If there's something you want to know, ask me. I have nothing to lie about and I'll tell you the truth. Just stop talking behind my back. 

I have never been happier with anything in my life as I am right now, and a lot of people have given my their support, but please, I'm asking the rest of you, even if you dont like me or support me, just stay out of this. I see no reason why i should have to continue to defend myself day in and day out. I just want to live my life and let you all live yours.

Hey, and if any of you even remember I'm still alive, give me a call sometime, I want to go out and do something...anything, but it seems like everyone is always busy

Phone #: 515-679-4472

Now you cant say you dont have my number.

Well, its late and I've been putting in a lot of hours at the restaurant, so im tired  (lots of hours like the 13 on ragbrai..i dont even know if thats legal .. :) ..)

But I'm going to bed

Love you all, Good luck to Caroline, Katelyn I know youre alive somewhere, Samantha i actually see sometimes..blah blah blah nothing im saying is making sense, so i better go to bed

adios amigos. necesito ir a cama por mucho horas. duele la cabeza. 

Buh-Bye

I wanna talk about Toby

.Some Kinda Good Kinda Hold on Me
by Toby Keith
album: Toby Keith (1993) 
She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 
She's some kinda fine sho-nuff sweet 
Wrapped up in her love is I wanna be 
She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 

I can't get enough of my baby's huggin' and kissin' 
I never knew a girl who could do what she's doing to me 
With just one touch she cast a spell 
I'm tangled up, I can't help myself 

She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 
She's some kinda fine sho-nuff sweet 
Wrapped up in her love is I wanna be 
She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 

The boys call me up and want to tell me 
About the fun I've been missing 
They want to know why I let her keep me under 
Lock and key 
But I got what they're looking for 
When she gets me behind close doors 

She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 
She's some kinda fine sho-nuff sweet 
Wrapped up in her love is I wanna be 
She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 

She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me 
She's some kinda fine sho-nuff sweet 
Wrapped up in her love is I wanna be 
She's got some kinda good kinda hold on me
 
Oh, i like that song, nice touch i might say, well, actually i think i did just say that. oh well, ill go ahead and say it again. Nice touch, speaking of touch....what the ----? okay, too much info. STOP!!

anyway...im still hungry. 

im really tired today..i want to go lay down and take a nap.. maybe later. ill prolly have to take one if they let me give blood, or ill just be too tired to stand up...

I dont know what it is, maybe it's just tiredness...hummm I might actually try getting some sleep one of these nights. I've been pretty busy lately, i have to work again tonight. tomarrow night i asked off so i could have some time for myself, but guess what...instead of it being off, i'm giving blood at 3:15, getting my hair done at 5:30 (which is really necessary), and then i have a work meeting at 9:30...the meeting wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt so late in the evening....i want to be sleeping by 9:30, but no chance of that, because ill just be getting to work. dan and kevin (my bosses) like to waste a lot of time, too. dont get me wrong, i absolutely love those guys, they are so awesome, but they dink around a lot at these silly meanings.

my Toby concert was absolutely amazing. the first song he sang was stays in mexico, and the entire stage was on fire for it. It was soo cool. I knew all the words to all the songs except for the one he did that has never been released to the radio or anything, but it'll be on CD May 17th, oh im so excited. my sister and i were on the big screen behind him twice. It was so amazing. I can't wait till i have another chance to go see him again. Oh i just loved every second of it. 

Here's a toby song for all y'all. he didn't actually sing this one at the concert, but I think it's hilarious and I might just have to listen to it when i go home this evening. 

If I Was Jesus, I'd have some real long hair
A robe and some sandals, is exactly what I'd wear
I'd be the guy at the party, turnin' water to wine
Yeah me and my disciples, we'd have a real good time.

Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (woooooh)
And I show you who's the boss (woooooh)
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hangin' on your cross
If I Was Jesus.

I'd have some friends that were poor
I'd run around with the wrong crowd, man I'd never be bored
Then I'd heal me a blind man, get myself crucified
By politicians and preachers, who got somethin' to hide.

Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (woooooh)
And I show you who's the boss (woooooh)
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hangin' on your cross
If I Was Jesus.

If I Was Jesus, I'd come back from the dead
And I'd walk on some water, just to mess with your head
I know your dark little secrets, I'd look you right in the face
And I'd tell you I love you, with Amazing Grace.

Ooh and I'd lay my life down for you (woooooh)
And I show you who's the boss (woooooh)
I'd forgive you and adore you
While I was hangin' on your cross
If I Was Jesus.

If I Was Jesus.


now, there is no way you can tell me that one wasn't awesomely amazing.

Oh I just love you Toby!!"

I dont think I told this to anyone yet, so I was talkin' to Steve on the phone the other night, and he was wonderin' if I hate him and said he feels like I've been ignoring him...let's think about this one for a while, humm... I don't respond to his e-mails, I dont call him back, I dont make any time to see him when he's in town.... Do I really have to tell him to back off? Shouldnt he just be able to figure it out? I don't really know what to do. I want to be friends, but he acts like he wants more than that. I dont know if he does or not, but I really hope he doesnt. Oh dear, someone help me.

Anyway, I love all of you and hope you all have lots of fun.

"event","Okay, how long can we all pretend. Our entire lives are pretty much just us and everyone around us pretending to care about things we have no interest in. School. Who cares. It's all over-rated. Katelyn and Eric, they aren't even dating and I hear more about them and the fact that they don't have a relationship then I hear about pretty much anyone else. I'm not trying to put anyone down here, You know I love you, Katelyn. But I'm just so sick of everything. No one around here is resonable. No one gets it. Once we're out of here, nothing that happened here will ever matter again, so why can't people just let some of it slide by them and not freak out about absolutly everything. 

Who knows, maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just being completely unreasonable. I don't know. I just want out. I need out. I'm going insane inside this stupid school. And guess who just walked by me. Yup, it was Ariel. She freaked out on me at lunch yesterday...more drama that needs to stop. Here's a hint for everyone, if I actively avoid ever seeing you or talking to you, I don't like you... by the way, that doesn't apply to anyone who would be reading this, unless Ariel somehow gets on here.. yeah right she's probably too stupid to be able to figure out how it works.

Josh tried to talk to me again the other day. I just don't want to talk to him, is that bad of me? We dated for 2 1/2 years, isn't that enough? I'm always sociable when I see him, but I just really don't want to talk to him much, and not really about things that matter to me. It's kind of strange though, because he was my best friend and now I don't tell him anything. I guess that much just be how life goes. It's like some kind of cycle. You meet someone, tell them all your secrets, get board and start over with someone else. Of course the cycle ends when you meet that person who, no matter how long you're with them, you never get board... Oh dear...I'm stuck (not referring to Josh)"

I just got home from work. It's Wednesday. 
You know, I go and check my e-mail, and the two people who write me are the two I really didn't want to hear from tonight. Everything just seems so crazy. I sometimes wish the one would just fall off the face of the earth, but that might be a little harsh. It's not like I hate them, I just don't like them. The other one just confuses me. They're dead set on helping me with this ""problem"" I have, but I really dont think this thing is a problem. I'm super excited and they don't understand. It just makes me feel so sad and upset at the same time. But then I think about why they're worried, I know they have good reasons for it. I just don't really know what to do. I know everything is going to work out in the end, but I'm afraid I'll really hurt someones feeling before it does. I don't want to do that. I hate intentionally hurting people. I hate hurting people at all. But what else can I do if they don't listen or just can't understand? Oh dear, what a dilema! EEEK!!

Anyway, school kinda sucked. It's just so hard to sit in those desks and pretend like I'm paying attention all day. I can't wait until I've graduated and won't have to put up with all this junk anymore. I realize my problems won't go away after high-school, really, i dont have any real problems, i just want out. 

I'll be going to see Toby Keith at the UNI Dome on Feb. 20th, I'm so excited. I absolutly love Toby. He is amazing. There is only one person in this entire world that I'd put above him right now. Maybe I should get off of here and go listen to him right now. I do own all his CD's. :D 

I shouldn't get on here so late at night. I'm in a grumpy mood, sorry. Oh well, I guess I'm just supposed to write what's happening and how I feel without worrying, right? Me, not worry.....nice. By the way, I'm mad at Renee for not trying out for Pops Concert. She would have easily made it. Heck, even Mr. Greenfield said she'd have probably made it if she tried out. And she would have sounded so beautiful up there. I know it shouldn't, but that really does make me mad. She has an awesome voice and so much talent and all she has to do is give it half a minute of time and she has it down perfectly. RENEE YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR IT!!!!

Yup, it is definitely time for me to head off for bed. Sleep well everyone and have happy dreams. I'll see most of you before you even realize I've written this, so good night.

Buh bye."

"event","Hi, I finally set up my own live journal. I'd read through the ones everyone else wrote, but I don't have any of your user names yet, so i guess ill have to get those at school in the morning. 

I havent really done anything today. I went to school...was super tired, and then came home. who knows, maybe ill start feeling crazy and actually study for semester tests...maybe

So, I was listening to the radio and all of a sudden this advertisement comes on, they're like...WE HAVE BIG NEWS...BIGGER THAN THE GRANDE CANNON, BIGGER than this and that..blah blah blah. I'm like, maybe they think its going to be big news, but unless they say Toby Keith is coming to perform somewhere near, it's not big news..guess what the next thing they said was! TOBY KEITH LIVE IN CONCERT AT THE UNI-DOME ON FEB. 20. TICKETS GO ON SALE JAN. 15. LISTEN TO (whatever station it was) FOR YOUR CHANCE TO WIN FREE TICKETS BEFORE YOU CAN BUY THEM! I'm so excited.. I will definitely be buying tickets and im definitely going....that is as soon as i get permission from my parents

Here's a joke for ya'll to read:

Grandma:
My grandmother has a bumper sticker on her car that says, 'Sexy
Senior Citizen'. You don't want to think of your grandmother that way,
do you? Out entering wet shawl contests. Makes you wonder where
she got that dollar she gave you for your birthday.

Since I'm board, here's another one:

Prisons:
Did you know that it costs forty thousand dollars a year to
house each prisoner? Jeez, for forty thousand bucks a piece I'll take a few
prisoners into my house! I live in Los Angeles. I already have
bars on the windows. I don't think we should give free room and
board to criminals. I think they should have to run twelve hours
a day on a treadmill and generate electricity. And if they don't
want to run, they can rest in the chair that's hooked up to the
generator.

Okay, just one more:

Phone-in Polls:
You know  those shows where people call in and vote on different
issues? Did you ever notice there's always like 18% ""I don't
know"". It costs 90 cents to call up and vote...They're voting ""I
don't know."" ""Honey, I  feel very strongly about this. Give me
the phone. (Into phone) I DON'T KNOW! (hangs up, looking proud)
Sometimes you have to stand up for what you believe you're not
sure about."" This guy probably calls up phone sex girls for
$2.95. (into phone) ""I'm not in the mood.""

Fine, but this is the last one:

Answering Machine:
Did you ever hear one of those corny, positive messages on
someone's answering machine? ""Hi, It's a great day and I'm out enjoying it
right now. I hope you are too. The thought for the day is 'Share the
love. '""Beep."" ""Uh, yeah...this is the VD clinic
calling...Speaking of being positive, your test is back. Stop
sharing the love.""

Okay, that's all for tonight...I'm really tired and must be getting to bed."

"event","hstrionic personality disorder:
pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:
<br>
1. is uncomfortable in sitautions in which he or she is not the center of attention - obviously.
2. interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior - obviously
3. displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions - yep
4. consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self - HAHAHA. yes.
5. has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail - 'you might know me from myspace'
6. shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion - apparent
7. is suggestible, easily influenced by others or circumstances - yep.
8. considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are - because you are too narcissistic to focus on anything else.

its just frustrating. i wish we could help. but we keep getting pushed out and replaced by other things. <br><br> we get so close<br><br>but then the setbacks show up...and we are yet again millions of steps behind where we were. <br><br>and there isnt a damn thing we can do about it. for either of them."

i got to read allll day today. it was amazing. all i read was harry potter. i sat outside in the grass in the sun and let my imagination go. i dont care if ppl think its ""unintelligent"" or ""immature"" to read harry potter. im sorry they dont have a creative imagination. i do and i like to exercise it thankyouverymuch.

"event","was quite dull. i was planning on leaving work a little early to come visit brannnndon while he was here but it turns out the girl i work with, her bfs grandpa died today, so she couldnt come in. i had to work her shift bc bonnie couldnt come back since she was in dsm. UGH. i was so pissed. so of course, all i did today was inventoryyy.
momma called me at work and invited me to supper with her teacher-friends. two of which i LOVE. theyre so funny:)
and super crude-humor, which i adored but my mother didnt hahaha. set up for some awkward situations of me laughing and mom glaring at me.
we had talks about what we did in gradeschool, highschool, and got some pretty varied topics. one was fads....tricia (prollllly about mid thirties) said the big thing for her was moonboots. HAHAH. those are ancient...
she goes, ""well thats good. here kids go play in the snow with sponges on your feet.""
she cracks me up.
andy..hilarious..ive known him since i was about 4. hes so sarcastic i can barely take it.

i had a blast<3

pretty pumped about tomorrow. get to go visit sallyyy<3 watch her get her hurr did. yay:) and i get to see amannndaaa roomie. :) and i get to see bryyyyyannnn. superduper day:) im hopin moms ok with me goin to ic...:S...cross your fingers. 

starting to feel drained now. i dont know. jess and trent stopped by a little while ago. i dont know why, but im so jealous of jess. she has friends here to hang out with. ive completely isolated myself from anyone here. even the ones i called my best friends, i rarely talk to. did i do it to feel sorry for myself? i dont know. all i know is im really, truly, unhappy here. i love my parents and sister to death. but im just not content. i do love dsm. but its just not enough yet. i want something more.

i want florida.
i want california.
either place
and i know i could be happy.
its where i feel like i belong. 

in cali...just walking along the piers in fishermans warf.
driving down to l.a. and walking along the beach.

i felt true happiness.
true contentment.

in florida. its amazing. beautiful. breathtaking.

all i know is i dont want to be here.
i dont think these next three years will go fast enough."

"event","that poor boy has been through so much. i dont know how to help him out. a fifth grader, his mom just died almost exactly a year ago from terminal cancer, was homeschooled by her up until fourth grade when she couldnt teach anymore, and even though its only been a year since her death, his dad is re-marrying in the next couple of months.
i dont know what to say for his grandma. she promised sandy that she would make sure zach got to school and kept up with everything, education and social life. but he makes it so hard for her. my mom told me that he had begged his grandma to ""please dont make me"" go to school. and his grandma had to push him out the door to get him there on time. hes almost forcing her to be the bad guy without doing it on purpose. grandmas are supposed to spoil; not discipline. apparently they got into a fight this morning and his grandma is almost ready to give up.
the poor boy has no one to turn to. his dad doesnt care about him, which is obvious. his mom, died. his grandma, cant be there that often; she is barely a part anymore (it was her daughter that died). she no longer has a tie to the family. she is not part of the fathers life nor his new brides. 
im not saying his family doesnt care, im sure they do. but they really have a hard time showing it.
hes so scared about the wedding; i think this is too soon for a ten yearold to have to deal with his mothers death, a woman whom he was with every day, and now having to live with someone completely new that the family barely even knows. 
i realize his father has gone through his grieving process. he sat with his wife while she was dying. and im sure she told him to move on; to find happiness, and to not be stuck in the past. its not good for anyone. but i dont think hes given the family enough time to grieve her loss.
i wish there was somethingi could do for zach.
take him out for ice cream or something.
that poor boy needs someone in his life to help him. because it seems that no one but his grandma really has the motivation to care.

uughh why do i have to worry about others so much? it wears on me everyday. i swear, someone tells me their problems and i can focus on only that. i cant deal with my own issues until i know the other persons is resolved.
whyyyyyyyy
when did i turn into this? i dont remember suddenly caring so much for everyone else. was it peter? was he the one that changed me? after i broke up with him that day....i dont think ive seen a person more hurt. (besides myself) the look on his face was the most heart wrenching look i have ever received. from anyone. i have never felt more guilt than that moment that i said we couldnt work it out. he cared for me more than anyone (excluding family). i feel horrible about that day. i was thinking about it today, and i realized, i wouldnt mind getting back together with him. he was kind. he cared. he didnt judge me even though he knew my past, and what i had been doing when he met me. i told him everything, and he loved me completely. and i crushed him.  i honestly dont think ill ever forgive myself for hurting him the way i did. granted, he was obsessed with cars. that got old hahahah. but still. he knew what to do for me when i needed it. and he suprised me. inviting me over and having an entire chinese buffet ordered in the basement..haha with barry white playing..what a nerd:) he knew just what to do to make me smile. 

i miss him."

"event","so ive never had a livejournal before...this is so much more confusing than myspace..

maybe thats just because i dont get it yet.

today was probably one of the most boring, uneventful days i have ever had. i was alone at work today, bonnie wasnt even there to open. so of course, i screwed something up, and shawna had to fix it. im getting so frustrated with this job. usually i can do something right away. i catch onto things quickly. but im not catching onto this at all. 
i think its probably because i dont want to be here. id rather be living in dsm working somewhere there. even with meredith. and i hate desk jobs. but id rather be in dsm with a crappy job. at least id be around people that i actually care about.
im tired of newton. im tired of the people here. everyone is so twoface. but i guess thats just human nature...do what is good for yourself. i just dont see how some people benefit from being mean to others. buuuut thats this area for you. dsm is the same way i guess..it just doesnt seem as evident. ive heard a lot of things from people...im of the opinion if i didnt hear it from their mouths..then it wasnt said.
im a little worried about where my dad is...he showed up while i was taking a shower, i could hear him upstairs. i came up when iwas done and hes gone..no note, didnt take the phone with him..nothing...so im worried. im really hoping nothing is wrong and im just overreacting.
i tend to do that.
welllll i guess that can be it for my firssst post. mostly im starving.
i think im going to order some pizza

"event","haha wow...crazy weekend...

friday-went to school, came home (hell yeah no practice!!!) got online, talked to some people, packed up, went to liz's, surprised her, ate spaghetti/cake/ice cream, gave gifts, had a marker fight with kim and mike, left for the haunted mill, got scared shitless at the haunted mill, came home, talked to a slightly annoyed ashlee, got on liz's computer, played the sims game for a little, passed out on the couch.

saturday-woke up around 8, got on the computer, ate pancakes, got a shower, got dressed, went to liz's sister's house to load up animals, went to the nursing home, unloaded the animals and set up the petting zoo, vistited my grandma for a little, hung out with liz, ate food, got ice cream, played some games and won more glasses and cups than i'll ever need in my life, went back to her house, packed up my stuff, came home, ate dinner, went to my grandparent's house, passed out on their couch, came home, went to sleep.

sunday-woke up, got a shower and got dressed, went into sunday school, taught the little kids, went to church, tried not to fall asleep, came home, ate breakfast, went to my challenge match and WON (yes that means i move up a spot in rank woo-hoo), went to the outlets to get some stuff for tuesday and got some stuff for homecoming plus two cds, came home, read the newspaper, and now i'm on here talking to ricci.

my parents are still fighting, i wish they'd jusr grow the fuck up and get over it-or just get a divorce (my preferred option).

i saw some adoreable pictures of ariana (sp?) today. ryan was back in school. aww there was one picture of lindsey in the hospital bed holding ariana and ryan leaning in with a big ass grin on his face was so fucking cute! but looking at those pictures gave me some serious mixed emotions...i want to be happy for ryan because 1) he's being so supportive of lindsey and he has stayed with her this long and 2) he has an incredibly adoreable baby girl but he and lindsey are only 16 and still in high school...no way are they ready for a kid. but i do wish them the best of luck.

on to happier news: i most definitely got a homecoming dress today. yee-haw! it's black with hot pink ribbon and an uneven hemline...sorry no pictures...and it's freakin' strapless. lmao. i've never worn a strapless dress before. never. don't believe me? well i'm serious. which is odd because i have a fairly small chest, so it's not like i'm eve gonna fall out of anything i wear. but it's a very hot dress. plus i got shoes and earrings/bracelet/necklace to match. too bad no one's on that i can talk to about it...naturally david and jase are both watching football. (too bad jase is watching the wrong team...he's watching the broncos when he should be watching the eagles! just kidding jase, i love ya!) and renee isn't on. i saw jenn and kelli while i was shopping.

but since i can't seem to find a guy, i'm off to watch a movie...i rented Mona Lisa Smile and Where The Heart Is. stop laughing! yes i know they're chick flicks but jeeze they're good. lol. if you're not into chick flicks but you want a good drama check out Dead Man Walking...it's from like 1998 with Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon...i totally love that movie...a guy on death row asks for a nun to spend time with him in his last months before his scheduled death...verrrrrrry good!"

I just might have to go to the Littlestown/Delone game in late October...should be a good game.

"event","WE TOTALLY KICKED KENNARD-DALE'S ASSES LADIES! 6-1, awesome score! Go Bolts! Unfortunately not everyone feels that way...what the fuck some Littlestown girls were shouting ""Go Kennard-Dale"" down at Brooke's court? would you like your asses kicked? what kind of team spirit is that? apparently our manager was down there (no surprise, she's a horrible manager) and a few players, which appalls me...especially when i heard who it was. if you'd rather play for another school, go ahead because idiot players is the last thing our team needs. 

ok glad i got that one out. i was majorly pissed when Brooke told me there were Littlestown players down at her court talking shit about her when she was playing. especially because she won. 

other than that the day didn't go as bad as i thought it might...i felt pretty anti-social after last night's/this morning's blow but my sweet friends cheered me up...the match wasn't half bad. i talked to lindsey and kimmie and they gave me some advice and opinions about some stuff. plus anthony stopped by the match after his soccer game...he's so funny. they won their second game of the season, which puts them 2-0 which is awesome for our first soccer team. i got into his soccer bag and took out his home game jersey (the white one, they wear navy ones for away games) and put it on...it was a size large so it was like a dress on me...the edge of the shirt was at the edge of my tennis skirt and the sleeves of the jersey came down to my elbows...but it smelled good so it was cool. he told me i would've made it if i had gone out for the soccer team...yeah right i totally blow at soccer haha. but it was sweet seeing him...i even took some sunflower seeds out of his hand and ate them because i skipped lunch to send David and e-mail. then i tackled him into the tree because he was making fun of me...i can't remember what for though...haha. then his dad came to pick him up so he's like ""bye dork"" and i'm like, ""yeah bye douche"" haha we're too cool. then of course liz gave me a dirty look because she's liked him forever. she's like ""thanks for flirting with him Sarah!"" but dude he's my neighbor, we've known each other since we were in first grade...i guess being friendly and maybe slightly flirty is just our nature, we don't mean anything by it. besides, if it isn't already obvious to her i still like David. if she wants Anthony she can have him, although he can't stand her. oh well.

i'm out, i'm sooo tired...my cheeks are pink for being windburned at the match...if any of you cared...lol."

I slipped on something wet of the floor and since i was wearing flip-flops naturally i fell and came straight down hard on my knee...now it's all swollen and turning a nice purple color...then i smashed the same knee again on my desk in world cultures today...and ben made fun of me for it too! lol. but i got him back so it was ok. he doesn't even know when his first cross country meet is...i asked him and he's like, ""that's a good question!"" he wants me to go but most likely i'll have tennis. but i promised him a locker sign for the meet...because what are best friends for? haha. i'll make one for kellye too since they're both on the team. </P>

"event","can i please skip the rest of high school and go straight to college? PLEASE? i'm so sick of high school bullshit for real...since when did Liz think it was ok to be telling other people my business? Mandy, a girl i've only talked to about twice in my life comes up to me in the locker room after gym while i was changing. (read: all i had on was my tennis skirt, spandex shorts and a bra and she's trying to talk to me while i'm half naked. wonderful.)

so the conversation went like this:
Mandy: ""Hey, Liz told me you were dating a nineteen year old!"" 
Sarah: *in an annoyed tone* ""No, he's eighteen...""
Mandy: ""Oh ok, I was gonna say, that's statutory rape, Sarah!"" *giggles*
Sarah: *in a really pissed off tone* ""ummm...that wouldn't be statutory rape...statutory rape is if there's a four year gap...there's only about a two year gap between us. why'd Liz tell you this?""
Mandy: ""Oh, we talk a lot in study hall""
Sarah: ""Oh.""
Mandy: ""So where does he live?""
Sarah: ""He's a freshman at Lock Haven""
Mandy: ""Oh...i've never heard of that...""
Sarah: ""It's in upstate central PA""
Mandy: ""Aww! that's awesome!"" *smiles really big at me and walks away*

So yeah i'm not too pissed at Mandy or anything because she's a sweet girl even though I barely know her, and she was just curious. but really, who is Liz to be going around telling people about <b>my</b> boyfriend? and if she's going to talk about my business, why can't she atleast get some facts straight? because 1) he's 18, not 19, i told her that only yesterday 2) she doesn't even know David...how can she go around talking about him? and 3) she might like to look up the definition of statutory rape, which in PA is four years in between the two people, not two there darlin'. obviously Liz doesn't know that there isn't much that pisses me off more than people who get into other people's business.


and supposedly some chick in freakin' Michigan said that she thought David would be dating someone who's ""drop dead gorgeous"". lol jealous bitch anyone? i'm sorry i didn't live up to her expectations...is she drop dead gorgeous? i doubt it...

i'm sorry...i'm definitely being a bitch today in this entry...but i'm feeling pretty defensive right now. i just don't think that my relationships should be the topics of other people's conversations is all."

"event","just got home from virginia...it was fun but a little boring...haha...but it was good...last night/this morning i took my mom's cell phone outside onto the porch outside the hotel and called David...had a pretty sweet conversation...AND he asked me out :-D...so yeah i was pretty freaking happy...and it almost didn't happen because he wasn't sure what he wanted...but we talked about things and i kept asking him if he had made up his mind yet and everytime i did he's like ""i was just about to ask you!"" and he said i made him nervous...aww he is so cute...and my phone was being gay and kept losing connection and the last time it did it i called back and instead of saying hello he's like, ""will you go out with me?"" and yeah...of course i said yes...so that made me really, really happy...all in all we talked for about two and a half hours...then i finaly went to sleep around 2:45. haha...then my parents and i went shopping today, i got a skirt and some shirts and a new pair of Vans...and the goo goo dolls gutterflower cd because i <3 the goo goo dolls thanks to corey introducing me to them last tennis season on the bus coming home from an away game. haha.

"event","wow...crazy shit this week...i'm not going to go into detail because most of you already know what's been going on...basically, people like to talk shit (or write shit, as the case is). but luckily the people that really matter to me saw through the shit and believe me...namely david...seriously, i was so scared that he'd believe that shit and stop talking to me...but he says he still cares about me, which is good because i still care about him...and i hope that he doesn't let my past mistakes affect the future...because i still want to date him. so yeah...all i can say is, thank you for still caring about me david...i heart you. :-)"

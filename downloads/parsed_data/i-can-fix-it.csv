"event","Gabriel Gray paced through the dreary streets of Brooklyn, a news paper held over his head to keep the light drizzle from soaking into his grey wool suit.&nbsp; His long features were set in a grim line, angered by the recent argument with his mother, still harping on him after all these years for maintaining his father's watch shop, rather than pursuing an academic career. &nbsp;She didn't appreciate that what he did kept a roof over her head and food on her table, but even that aside, the shop was the only refuge Gabriel had from the pressing masses of humanity, of which he felt no part.

At last, he was safe inside the dark, quiet shop, away from the hustle of hundreds of bustled skirts and tail-coated men, just the quiet ticking of more than two dozen clocks and the soft glow of the gas lamps burning&nbsp; in their sconces.&nbsp; He hung up his hat and coat, cleaned the fog from his glasses, and reluctantly turned about the 'open' sign propped in the window.&nbsp; Hopefully no one would have need of a repair or a purchase today.&nbsp; Honestly he just wanted the time alone with his current projects.&nbsp; Some time with that Baroque fob watch he'd been tinkering with for the last seven years of his life would do him a world of wonder."

"event","Sylar's eyes slipped closed as those sweet lips touched his cheek.&nbsp; He shivered, his mind at war with itself over what he wanted more.&nbsp; Mohinder, and what he promised, or the thrill of the kill.&nbsp; After having been out of commission for so long, a reaffirmation of his prowess, his control over life and death was intensely appealing. But after being separated from the doctor for even longer...

He turned his head and touched his lips to Mohinder's briefly, then pulled ahead to the check station.&nbsp; Rolling down the window, he leaned his full head and left arm out, a casual enough position, and grinned at the officer.&nbsp; &quot;Hi there.&quot;

&quot;Passports, sir?&quot;&nbsp; 

&quot;Ahhh, no,&quot; Sylar's smile became apologetic as the officer took a closer look at him.&nbsp; In an instant the guns were out of their holsters, calls going out over comms units.&nbsp; Of course, just as quickly, Sylar made use of his own weapons, sending the officer flying back several yards, sprawling, but not dead.&nbsp; He wouldn't even be all that hurt, just bruised a bit.&nbsp; Evidenced when he scrambled to his feet and fired shots at their car."

<b>Summary:</b> Building 26 is never shut down.  No one convinces the president that it's best to just drop the matter of evolved humans, and Danko is given cart blanche to deal with the super-powered threat as he sees fit.  In the next century the Evolved are hunted to the brink of extinction, either out-right exterminated, or imprisoned and exploited for their ability.  The number of specials used in this way grows fewer and fewer as time and mishaps progress, but one type is still coveted above all.  Exterminating a regenerator is exceedingly difficult, anyway...
<b>Status:</b> In progress/PRIVATE

<lj-cut text=""...all my foolish, fuckin' wishing..."">
Shenoy Biotech Industries, the world leader in medical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic biotechnologies.  Branches across the globe in at least one major city in every first-world country and several within the United States: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington D.C.  Advances by the company have cured the terminally ill, made the blind to see and the lame to walk and have prolonged human life beyond the twenty-first century's limited reach. ...for those who can afford it.

The price of the <i>best</i> services are astronomical, for though the fountain of health, youth, and beauty never runs dry, the resource is rare indeed and output difficult to optimize.  Which makes the D.C. branch's most recent acquisition seem well-worth the long search and countless lives it has cost to obtain it.

Seemingly innocuous on the slab, a man of just-above average height, lean build and slender frame.  His pale skin has a bluish cast to it and his brunette hair is matted with his own blood, for all appearances nothing more than a cadaver ready for organ harvesting, but that would be pointless in his current state.  The organs could be removed, yes, but the body cavity would remain as empty as any other autopsied corpse with the 6-inch metal spike that's currently lodge in the back of his head.

First, precautions must be taken.

Clothing is cut away, revealing more lavender-cream skin, more dark, soft hair, and more lean, strong, but limp flesh.  Tubing and needles are rudely thrust into the uncooperative, seemingly dead flesh, holes bored into bone, restraints applied and tightly locked down.  They have him, they are sure, this mythical beast, this Unicorn in human form that has impaled and gored so many hunters, at last taken down and chained in the name of healing (in the name of profit.)

A nod of a head.  They try to time it right.  To dump their chemicals into his system just as it begins uptake, the spike sliding out of his brain matter with a sickening sound, like a child rudely sucking a too-thick milkshake through a narrow straw.

Machines whir and buzz and beep to life, charts on screens beginning to run, the signs of life returned.  His flesh looses its oxygen-starved look, blushes healthy golden-cream.

All is still.

They hold their breaths as machines breathe for him.

Their eyes stare wide as his threatening amber glare remains sealed behind the dark fringe of his eyelashes.

--'---,,--

Sylar stood bare and blood spattered in the center of the processing room.  The redness of it fascinated him, pooling around and between his toes from the severed bodies of the doctors and nurses littered across the cool linoleum floor.  Cold, smooth floor. Hot, sticky blood.  The contrast of sensations gave him a cold pleasure, but did nothing to take the edge off the rage boiling inside him.  He had been taken.  Violated.  After all this time evading them and he had found himself back on a cutting table, prepped and drugged, though once again insufficiently, even more so than the last few times so long ago.

Irritated by the whine of the machinery he waved a hand and smashed it all, bits of glass and sparks falling down into the puddle, further empty attempts at catharsis.  He picked among the doctors to find clothing suitable to wear on his way out, managing a complete set with only a couple minor stains. Thankfully he'd felt the need to snap one man's neck instead of eviscerating him like the others, and a pair of shoes his size just needed a bit of polishing off.

He left the white, sterile room with that bloodbath concealed behind the tight steel door, the security locked portal swinging shut just before a nurse exiting opposite him could see inside. She didn't even blink at him as she clipped away, nose down toward a chart screen.  Her door had just opened as his closed and still remained so for a moment, long enough to see beyond into a room not unlike that he'd just left.

Too bright-white, bleach-clean and bright, brushed steel, unsettlingly chatty machines.  Shenoy had never managed to improve on that.

And in the 'bed' in the middle, a form disfigured almost beyond recognition.

Almost, but not quite.

""Claire...?""

The Intuitive strode forward quickly, slipping through the last crack of the metal door before it swished closed, sealing them inside.  Sylar had never been a creature of moderate emotion.  Either blazing with hate and anger or numb with cold indifference, this time he felt ice in his blood for a wholly different reason. 

This... they'd done <i>this</i> to her, and it was what they'd meant to do to him.

"event","Summary: Simmons wasn't lying when he said the Government had aprehended Samson Gray.  Sylar gets a bare minimum of information out of him before the man goes for his gun and is microwaved into a puddle by Luke.  Sensing a common spirit in the boy, Sylar baits Luke into following him with the bonus of stealing Mom's woodpanel station wagon.  So begins the roadtrip toward Washington, D.C., and the answers both so desperately seek.

<lj-cut text=""A Butterfly Flaps Its Wings..."">They had been traveling south on the I-95 for about a hour, mostly in silence in the dark of early evening.  They had passed exits for East Brunswick a few minutes ago and the station wagon was still quiet, nothing but the sound of vehicles passing in the opposite direction on the other side of the divide.  Sylar hadn't bothered to take his eyes off the road in some time now, except to check the mirrors, leaving his young companion in ambiguous solitude even though they were sitting side by side.  

Truth be told he was intensely curious about the boy, but he was also exceedingly patient.  He'd learned better about rash judgements and actions recently, charging ahead too quickly on assumptions of people's character.  It was easier, now that no one could possibly deceive him, verbally anyway, but he was circumspect nonetheless.  Not to mention he was savoring this.  Like his trip with a certain foreign geneticist, he was letting Luke Campbell reveal himself naturally.  He'd make a more honest observation of him like that.  (Nevermind the small powertrip of making him wait with baited breath. And Gabriel could use such an ego boost after being used the way he was.) 

Silence was something he was used to so he wasn't exactly eager to break it himself. It was going to be a long drive, sure but hey if this guy, this Gabriel wanted to know something about him he could just ask. He didn't need to know that Luke was bursting with questions about where he came from, how long he's known, what all he can do since--for one thing that coffee didn't leave a mark on him. Shifting under his seat belt he looks at the dashboard clock. Hm. Wonder how long before sirens show up in the rearview mirror. His mom must have called the cops...doesn't she get it that he doesn't need her? Especially not now. She couldn't answer the types of questions he has about what's happening to him and why. He leans forward and turns on the radio, an idle gesture if anything. People aren't supposed to be so comfortable in a silent car right? There should be something droning on in the background. He leans his head against the seatbelt, staring out of the window as he replays the scene at his former home in his mind again and again. That military guy didn't stand a change against what he can do. It felt good even when he watched his flesh had turned into--a boiled mass of soupy remains-- seep out from his fallen body. He did something, he acted, he wasn't a victim like the so-called bullies at school tried to make him. So what if he started the fight that landed him in that joke of a 'detention facility'?

NPR.  Probably the mother's choice, but Gabriel approved.  News without the sensationalism.  They'd hear about politics, art, and certain catastrophes, but probably not Luke's 'abduction', and everything with a subdued dignity about it.  Even some music, which was generally relaxing in nature.  Which was good.  He was about ready to flatten his foot to the floor to get to the address Simmons had divulged before he died.  After a bit though, the older man's brandy eyes drifted to the mirror and this time caught they boy's reflection in it.  &quot;Which do you think she'll miss first?&quot;

&quot;The car. She'll file the report for that and then for me if she remembers. She hates public transportation.&quot; He knows that and it was probably a factor in why he did it. &quot;It's why we even ended up with this piece of shit.&quot;  His eyes flit over to catch Gabriel's looking over at him. &quot;She's going to be pissed that you got all that blood on her clean, new carpet, she just had that put in like a month ago. I wandered through the living room with a soda in my hand once and you would have thought that I'd tried to burn the house down with how she yelled at me to stay out of the living room with that.&quot;

&quot;Ah, I only made a little mess, now you... She'll have to go all the way down to the floorboards to get that out,&quot; he chuckled softly, liking Luke's answer.  He didn't even have to plant the seeds of discord and resentment in this boy's mind.  Get him out of earshot of Mom and it all just came pouring out.  A sympathetic ear probably helped, and wasn't that just rare? That Sylar would ever be a sympathetic ear.  He wondered how well the kid would hold up.  Granted, Gabriel hadn't fixed up that noose until it all got out of hand and it wasn't just strangers dieing any more... But Luke was so much younger.  Vestiges of an artificial conscience might still be eating at him.

Turns to him again, the softest chuckle coming out of his lips as well. Yeah...she will. He turns to look over at the man in the driver's seat a little more . &quot;Who was that guy anyway? You made it sound like he was after you first.&quot; He'd like an idea of who he so instinctually erased from the world. It's not guilt he's feeling right now, it's curiosity. Gabriel seems like he's really a part of 'something big' and that's exciting for Luke. That pacemaker line for one, was not a joke or a lie. Something he learned when his mother forced him to visit his asshole grandfather in a nursing home. It was the day he first thought maybe something was 'off' about him. But his attitude has since changed, he really likes whatever this thing is he can do.

&quot;To be perfectly honest with you? I don't completely know.  He was the last one left of the men who tried to abduct me from the house down the street from yours, Samson Gray's,&quot; he didn't figure they were Primatech men. Not the Company's style.  Perhaps the soldiers of Pinehearst, but Aurthur was dead and on his way through Jersey Sylar had seen the building had burnt to the ground.  &quot;I think they're military, and they're after people like us, people who can do things, special.&quot; And they had Samson Gray.  That was all Gabriel really needed to know.  He was confident he could handle anything thrown at him.  As valiant as Luke's 'rescue' was, Sylar had stopped bullets headed his way before, and he'd be going in knowing the guards would be both specially trained and armed.  They still wouldn't be ready for something like him.

&quot;Ah yeah, old man Gray...The cautionary tale down the street. My mom would always use him as some sort of bad example for me. I talked to the guy once or twice. Kinda weird, but he's harmless. Do you know him or something?&quot; He hadn't ever seen anyone hanging around Gray's place so it was weird that this guy came out of nowhere and cared so much about him. And military...that was not what he expected would happen when he found out what he could do. &quot;Are there alot of people like us? I guess there has to be if there's military involvement.&quot;</lj-cut>"

"event","<Lj-cut text=""My soul is so afraid to realize...""> The cafe was packed. Bohemians of every medium crowded around tables, painters, poets, musicians and poseurs, discussing, debating, flirting with the cafe girls, drinking away what little prosperity they could scrape together. Mixed among them also were afficianados like Gabriel Gray. No artist himself, not of a kind they wouldn't have laughed at here, he had come into enough money that he was considered part of the artistic elite. Middle class and anemic, but he would lay down a bottle and let his young visionaries drink it all up without complaint. They liked him well enough for that. 

Tonight he sat beneath the low lamps, pale as moonstone through the smoke with ice water in front of him and a pack of poets tripping on absinthe half falling around him. His features were like carved marble, smooth and barely expressive beyond the twitch of a smile, like an expression half-forgotten.



 He was only half listening to their conversation. His eyes were tracking a barmaid nearly as pale as himself, though her skin lacked the luster his possessed. She looked more waxen, and very distracted. Her eyes raked the customers, and he knew what she was looking for; a stranger, a drifter, someone who wouldn't be missed. It was easy enough in Whitechapel, but the further from town, the better. Some one that NO ONE would miss, and the police wouldn't care to investigate. 

She wasn't necessarily intelligent, this one, just streetwise. If she were intelligent she would know that she wasn't the only one hunting... </lj-cut>"

When I say I stalk his wardrobe instead of the man, I mean it.

The Story:

So I never would have known where to find this thing if I hadn't seen the Golden Gopher bar before I even knew what a Zachary Quinto is.  Going to school at USC (which is in a shit part of town, thus putting me in the possition of moving through other shit parts of town) I rode buses through questionable neighborhoods and drove through strange areas to get where I wanted to go, so I'd been by the place before. 

It took seeing the hat pop up a few times before I figured out what the heck the logo on it actually was, but the lay out was so familiar, I knew I'd seen it.  That's when it clicked, and I motored myself down to the place one early Friday to see if they had any left.

No such luck.  Sold out.  But the newer bartenders told me to come back after ten when Diego would be around, because he'd been there longer than any of them and would know about the hats.  Diego turned out to be a really great, helpful guy, and I impressed him by asking for a glass of Pernod, which I drink regularly, but NO ONE ELSE does.  I was floored they even had it!

Diego totally hooked me up.  He put in an order for the hats, and let me know the instant they came in. He also asked me to bring the picture I'd used for reference (which previously I'd only shown from the hat up.  I was stalking the hat here, not the guy wearing it. XD ) Turns out the hats were Diego's idea, but the owner wasn't so hot on them, and having a picture of Zachary Quinto of ""Heroes"" fame (infamy?) would be great to show his boss.  

I ended up sending Diego an e-mail of Mr. Quinto wearing the hat in like, seven different places, so he could see how much Mr. Q appreciates his creation. XD

Interesting thing: Diego says he's never seen the actor in the bar, which makes me wonder, considering the hats had a single, limited run (previous to my order), how the heck did Quinto come by the thing???

He was listening to the Herrera siblings, conversing freely in what they believed was the security of his slumber and their native tongue. He was slightly offended at their assumption, even if it did work in his favor.<br /><br />He could have at least recognized his own name in their argumentative muttering, but three years of foreign language in preparation for the university he never went to gave him even greater advantage than that. If he'd only had access to that perfect memory that now seemed so dampened and blurred he would have known even the smallest nuances, but he still knew enough to realize Alejandro would never be taken in by Gabriel's eager helpfulness. It wasn't that he had any concrete reason to mistrust Gabriel; Alejandro Herrera was simply an overprotective brother with a pretty, naive sister in need of saving from the <i>world</i>.<br /><br />He also understood enough to know that Maya was <i>smitten</i>, so when he finally stretched and rose he made certain to pick an insignificant moment to catch her eye in the rear view mirror and smile warmly. Leaning forward between the front seats he eyed the clock and turned to Maya as though Alejandro wasn't even there. ""Your brother has been driving for hours,"" his pitch was slightly high and his tone sympathetic. ""How about a Chinese fire-drill, and I'll take over for a while?"" he smiled wider, anticipating her eager agreement.</div>"

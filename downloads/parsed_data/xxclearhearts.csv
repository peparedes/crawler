"event","Everything is coming together for the talent show and I'm really excited. We've ordered all the equipment, sold loads of tickets (TJ is a ticket-selling machine!) and are on top of just about everything else. We're hiring a 12 foot projector for behind the acts and the powerpoint we're working on is going to look the shiz!

In other news, it's the start of block three tomorrow, so new timetable! 12 weeks to go? Where has the time gone! This year has been all about the banter!

I've just remembered that I need to download the Thriller video and send it to BMac. So I'm going to do that!"

"event","I'm in project management and it's taking pure ages  cos all the idiots are asking Davey to do all the tasks for them and I've got a 5 second question that's going to need to wait >.< I wanted to be finished for break so I could give Brian a hand with his stuff.

I did finish my newsletter though which was an achievement. It's sexy and I hate Microsoft Word.

I went for a job interview with O2 and didn't get past the agency. Haha, I suck. If anyone wants to give me a job, that'd be great cos my current job sucks :("

"event","I've been ill :(
Been off work yesterday and today doing absolutely nothing. Still went into college for the open day yesterday and spent all day sitting at a stall doing nothing. Good times.

Did pretty much the same today, despite the fact I could've been doing my VB project, my building LANs report or my project management, all of which is due in this week. Yay. I jut can't concentrate on anything of late!

I think I'll feel better when the summer comes in. Can't wait :("

"event","Well, I had a very nice wee weekend. It's nice to have a whole weekend off, wish I could do it all the time :(

Jim's parents arrived on Friday and thankfully he managed to get the night off. They got me a book about cupcakes for my christmas which I actually love. Prepare to get very fat as I make more cupcakes than any one person can eat :) Saturday we went into town with Toyah, Christine and Angela DRESS SHOPPING. Reming me when I get married never to go to Berketex. Horrible staff, man. Anyway, I reckon Toyah's found the dress she wants and it's just gorgeous. When we got home, Jim cooked 3 different dinners and the two that I tasted were beautiful ^_^

Sunday, Me and Jim went into town and met Toyah, Stan and Angela. They went to Alien Wars and I'm a woose. We went to the Lab and got lunch and Jim got a pint that cost more than my meal. Bought some stuff we can't afford and went to Toyah's to help her drink her tequila.

All in all, a very nice weekend :)

So now I'm trying to eat healthy and get fit and stuff and it's a bastard. I wish people would stop telling me to give up smoking :( ONE THING AT A TIME!"

"event","I pure miss people. People I know will never get in touch, and even if they do it won't last. Apart from family and Jim there's no-one consistent in my life and it's starting to get me down a bit. I've tried really hard to get on with people I've met in college etc. but they just don't seem to get me. I don't mean that in a sort of misunderstood teenager way, I mean it in a they-think-I'm-weird way. Anyone who's met me knows I'm a bit awkward. I don't talk much but for some reason I feel the need to try to make conversation even though I have nothing to say and just look like a tit. I'm a nice person, but apparently it must be really difficult to get along with me :(

I miss being cool."

"event","Jim's cooking beer battered, jerk seasoned chicken. I'm normally cynical about his recipes but they always turn out well :) I'm rather looking forward to this.

I've felt a bit weird all day. Sort of up and down. Work was really dead, so I just tidied all day. I even hoovered. I love hoovering.

I'm currently making a Wist of all the stuff I want for my house, cos it's looking a bit dull. There's no point in having a pretty flat and not having pretty (le crueset) stuff. Le Crueset is my new love. Anyway, here it is:

"event","Hi 2009!

So I hadn't updated this in like a year so I've made all my old entries private and I'm gonna start again.

I might use it to document my soap too, I'll see.

So not much is up really. Got a new flat, in Shawlands. Made some new friends at college.

Watching CBB, I reckon it's gonna be funny :)"

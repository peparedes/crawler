lots have happened.. lets see.
Got in a relationship with a coworker... long story short: 8 months later we broke up and about 4 months after that he was still under the impression we were going to get back together and when he found out that ""OMG Kal has friends.. and some are boys!"" shit hit the fan and I havent really seen much of him since. and surprise surprise... I'm okay with that.
Got a new job title. Mobile Sales Consultant. Not as flashy as it sounds let me tell you. I did get to go to a week long district training out of state and stay at a hotel (where i proceded to get absofuckingloutly shitfaced and puke for the first time in my life). We ate well while we were there. 
more to come later."

"event","I think I want a piercing, I just need to find out what will be acceptable at work. I'm entertaining the idea of a couple different ones, like tongue (maybe traditional, off center or venoms) or navel (top to start, but then at some point 2 more to make a triangle), ears (helix  or conch, maybe an industrial or antitragus) or.... others. yeah, we'll leave it at that.

So there are a lot of things in my life i should take a step back from and at the very least, just look at them. 

Some deserve the time for admiration, others for reconsideration.



My job, for example, I really like it. I like it more than I thought I could. My bosses are great for the most part, ready to give out ""Way to work it, Kalzone!""s whenever needed or earned.

My relationship.
Now this is a big one. HUGE. My boyfriend is pretty much the reason for my happiness nowadays. I wish I could remember all the sweet things he has done for me, but there really have been too many to count or remember. I haven't even found all the cute little things he has left behind I'm sure. Like notes left in my backpack, or on my car stuck under a wiper blade or whatnot. 

My independence.
I've recently decided, sort of against my will, that I'm going to be taking the steps needed to declare myself completely independent of my parents. After all, I already buy my own food, pay my own bills, and do everything I need by myself. My laundry is done at a laundromat etc. 

My future.
Apparently I don't qualify for financial aid and my fafsa got messed up. I am in the process of cleaning up that mess, but i don't know if I'll be able to afford an education this way. So depending on how these next presidential elections go, I'll probably be joining the military. I mean, physical fitness and a free education while getting paid... we'll see.

and other things i'm sure. I just got out of my writing funk, so i'll have to continue this later.


I miss you all"

yeah- i had a few cards. no cash. but my bank card.
anything else? (susspecting it's just fallen out of my car at some point)

Anatomy my favorite class i love everything about it except the people in the class. what can ya do? then outreach.
oh outreach. i love it. i'm gettign in shape and i feel healthier. every other day 1+ hour of workout and everyday 20-30 minutes in a 150 degree sauna. it's fantastic and i look forward to it everyday.
work. still blows out the ass, one supervisor isn't that great and will be going back to mornings as soon as there is another supervisor to fill in. there's one in training right now, but there is another supervisor that plans on going to kohls. so we'll still be up shit creek. so i'm gettign another job. in about an hour i'm going to get an application to work some place else. excited? you bet.

so when that gets done doing whatever... i go home and tell my parents <b>i think i need to go to the ER.</b> if you ladies and fellas know anything about my folks, besides that they are probably older than yours, it's that they don't like it when i need stuff. Not saying that they don't love me or anything, but really, it took convincing.
So we go to the ER. and of course, there is like a dozen and a half people, and a 2 hour wait. so i get my pretty little bracelet and wait some more. then a nurse calls me and <b>i have to go pee in a cup</b>. then we go into a room and wait some more. the doctor comes in, feels my stomach and asks questions. mostly if i'm pregnant or if there is any chance i'm pregnant. or if i'm sure i'im not pregnant and if i'm on the pill. whatever doc. then <b>they take some blood</b>, not so fun, but could be worse. <b>the pee tests come back and ! i'm pregnant! </b>

JUST KIDDING!  
<b>no really, just a bladder infection,</b> no bun in the oven. they give me an antibiotic and are <b>just about to send me on my way when! blood tests come back! Gallbladder infection.</b> at this point it's like gallstones? gallsludge? what? so i get a brand spanken new IV. fantastic. by this time it's 7 and the ultrasound team has apparently left. we have to wait for them to come back so i can get an ultrasound. they come back, i get <b>my ultrasound (warm jelly) </b>and i go back and wait. the doc comes in and is like <b>you need your gallbladder out. tonight.</b> what surgeon do you prefer blahblah blah, we get that all set up, and i start to cry. whatever. literally less than a minute later, doc comes in mouth hanging open and is like <b>according to your ultrasound, you're pregnant.</b>

Just kidding, again.

...according to your ultrasound, <b>you're gallbladder is the picture of health! </b>so i'm thinking , yay! i get to go home! not so fast! Your <b>spleen</b>, however, is <b>enlarged</b>. you have <b>mono</b>, but apparently you've been living with it for months now, and your spleen has been working overtime to filter out the bad stuff. so go see your real doctor as soon as you can, get some steroids for it and you'll get better in a month. 
<b>so i have a bladder infection and mononucleosis.
but we still don't know why my gallbladder results came back off. 
fantastic!  </b>"

"event","alright so in case you one of the hundreds of people i haven't talked to in a while...
i have a car a license and my 180 days of restricted-ness is up in about 2 weeks.
my orthodontist says that my teeth are progressing, though it seems as if i won't get them off before.... graduation. or something.
my hair is pretty long now, i have to actually try not to cut it or dye it now. it's gettign pretty tough.
i'm failing all but 3 of my classes currently, and those classes don't really count. (history, pot and clay 2, and Study hall.) but i know i'll get them up to atleast passing by the end of it all.
i'm taking elpm text year, for how many classes, i'm not sure. maybe fultime.
i'm spending more money than i'm making, spending about 50, making 25040/week. plus we have car insurance to deal with. ugh.
Jon and i are still together, and very happy. Friday we have our FIRST date. *nervous*. The DaVinci Code comes out then, and thats what we are going to see. i already have tickets. :)
my sister is movign to portland where she'll be attending SMCC. she's very excited and i'm worried for her, i hope she'll make it. 
this means that i'll be, basically, an only child. i know i won't be able to handle my mother, and it makes me worried. she's gone crazy recently and i don't know why. 
I've been tryign to take better care of my body. unfortunatly, Eating healthy has not worked out at all. it has backfired. i've been tryign to work out more. i hope that will go better once school gets out.
i can't believe that junior year is drawing to a close and i'll soon be a senior. ugh crazy.
 so many firsts (and hopefully some lasts) occured this year, it's insane to think that it's already over.

 oh well."

"event","just for clarifacation-

I'm not going to Prom because Jon doesn't want to go, not because I don't have money to get a dress, not because I don't think it will be a fun time.

I'm not going because:

It's my sister's senior prom. it should be about her.
It's too late, i don't want to get a dress that looks like everyone elses.
none of my friends are going.
I'm sure I can spend less money and have just as much fun.



i think i'll ask jon on a date."

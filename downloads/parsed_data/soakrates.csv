Pretty much. I haven't had a fighting game to curl up with ever since the Soul Calibur 3 ""scene"" became a breeding ground for (completely sanctioned) game-breaking bullshit. So when I finally brought VF5 home, it was kinda like getting a new piece of music gear and tinkering with it for the first time. Well, for me anyway.

The game is awesome. I've always admired the Virtua Fighter series for its lofty aspirations and heady gameplay, even if I was initially a little intimidated by its reputation for being somewhat unfriendly to novices. The fifth installment does alleviate this somewhat by making some of the harder moves and attack strings easier to execute (sup Akira), but doesn't cheapen the series by catering to a lower common denominator. 

Yeah, the clash system is pretty iffy, and throws a tiny wrench into the classic VF clockwork -- Seriously, the ""attack beats throw"" mechanic worked great through so many iterations of the series, so why fuck with it? -- but it's not nearly enough to ruin the game, which is for the most part extremely fluid and built on a very solid foundation. 

Oh right, the online play. Yeah, it's pretty awesome. The lobby and matchmaking functions suck ass, but it's obvious that Sega worked overtime to get the netcode right so all is quite easily forgiven. I've had quite a few virtually lagless matches where it rarely occurred to me that I was playing online. Just yesterday, in fact, I had a great back-and-forth marathon with a guy from Oregon that went very smoothly.

Fighting games have been one of my favorite pastimes for a while now. I really hope one day that they'll garner the status of FPSes like Counter Strike and Halo, with massive tournaments for huge cash prizes. The Evo tournaments are headed in the right direction, I think, but it could still be a while. VF5's solid online play can hopefully bring it one step closer to reality.</lj-cut>

And hey, whadda ya know, the new Helloween album is pretty damn great too."

"event","Wow. ""The Beach"" was probably the worst episode of Avatar I've ever seen. It was as though an intern handed the director some horribly written fan-fiction as a joke, and it somehow got animated. The cast was woefully out-of-character, the fan-service embarrassingly obvious, and the dialogue truly awful. I swore I could hear the voice actors stifling their laughter every time Zuko opened his mouth. 

Also, I fairly recently discovered that my appreciation for <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/arcturusnorway"">Arcturus</a> has grown exponentially in the last couple of months. This of course after they called it quits several months ago. They defy description, really. Ostensibly a metal band, they've blended classical, black metal, prog rock, trip hop, industrial, and probably a few other genres I'm forgetting right now. And they pull it all off with a theatrical, almost vaudevillian flair. 

Truly proof that metal deserves a lot more scholarly attention than it's gotten.

In case you couldn't tell, I just saw <a href=""http://5cm.yahoo.co.jp/index.html"">5 Centimeters Per Second</a>, the latest feature from one Makoto Shinkai (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0370754/"">Voices of a Distant Star</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381348/"">The Place Promised in Our Early Days</a>). It's an interesting turn for him, as it removes the sci-fi subplots of his earlier features, and focuses squarely on the lives of three people as they travel from childhood to maturity. 

<lj-cut text=""Some blathering on it"">The fact that I found myself rooting for all three of its main characters is a clear signal that I enjoyed it. Sure, Shinkai can lay it on pretty thick with the introspective monologues, but you know, teenagers really <i>do</i> think and talk that way sometimes. And there's nary a person alive who couldn't see a little of themselves in here somewhere.

One could find fault with how the ending is presented (basically a tawdry music video that drops some key hints as to the main characters' fates), but the events themselves make perfect sense. If nothing else, Shinkai really knows how good it feels to be missed by someone.

Then, of course, there's the gorgeous scenery. If there's one thing we've come to depend on from Shinkai, it's superb artwork, and here he delivers in spades. A combination of careful location scouting and stellar talent creates what could be one of the best-looking anime features ever made. Shinkai gives us an eyeful of breathtaking rural landscapes, tumbling oceans, billowing clouds, snow-drenched railways, and shimmering city blocks; all rendered (via CG, in some cases) with painterly grace and exhaustive attention to detail.

The animation too is excellent. From the slug-like movement of commuter trains to swaying grass, the whole thing is just so goddamn <i>expressive</i>. It's movies like this that lend credence to the idea that animation needn't contain sci-fi cliches or surrealist ""cartoon-isms"" to engage the viewer.

Oh, and Tenmon's sweeping, piano-driven scores are always a treat. In the time it took me to write this, I've probably played the ending theme close to 10 times.</lj-cut>

Overall an 8/10 I'd say. A very good (and visually stunning) but flawed drama that will nonetheless stick with you for some time, and could be fairly difficult to watch again.

Meanwhile, I got into a minor car accident on Wednesday. Nothing serious, but the damage is gonna cost me a considerable chunk of change to fix. Eh, shit happens. More on that later.

Slept in on Friday and grabbed some lunch with a friend, then I stayed up until early Saturday morning to watch the <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/2000yearoldmeteorstoraindownonaugust312007;_ylt=AgMvIFHWm4mAWx9PBweeSxTq188F"">Aurigid meteor shower</a>. Just before going to bed, I finally <i>found my blasted keys</i>, which had been missing for like a week and a half. 

Then yesterday, a friend and I went to Oakland's Jack London Square to see Allan Holdsworth. We had dinner on the pier before the show, and then took a short stroll to Yoshi's to catch the gig, <lj-cut text=""and let me tell ya...."">

I love lots of different types of music, but I'm not afraid to admit that I enjoy some more than others, and jazz will probably never supplant either one of my two favorite genres, metal and progressive rock. 

That said, after last night I can safely say that I've never seen a better guitarist than Holdsworth. His technique, knowledge and unique interpretation of harmony, and Coltrane-like improvisational skills are unparalleled. Every time this guy takes a solo, you just know you're going to hear or see something amazing. There's a reason guys like Steve Vai, Eddie Van Halen and even Yngwie Malmsteen call him the best.

Allan also had two fantastic accompanists in drummer Chad Wackerman and bassist Jimmy Johnson, who are also very accomplished soloists, it turns out. Wackerman's closing drum solo in particular almost stole the show. The former Frank Zappa skinsman knows how to keep it musical, performing all sorts of surreal syncopations and patterns, and keeping perfect time the whole way through. Amazing.</lj-cut>

Also, it's worth mentioning that Yoshi's is an awesome venue. Great atmosphere, great sound, and though I didn't get a chance to sample any of it, I hear the food is pretty awesome as well.

So yeah, if you live in the Bay Area or LA/Orange County, you still have a chance to see him, and I highly recommend you do. Check his <a href=""http://www.therealallanholdsworth.com/allanlive.htm"">tour page</a> to see if/when he's swinging by your neck of the woods. You won't regret it.

Anyway, next up on my calendar is Finntroll, whom I'll be seeing in SF just two days after my birthday. Should be a lot of fun. Polka + black metal + Scandinavian folklore = <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1vumjWdqYQ"">pure undistilled awesomeness</a>."

<lj-cut text=""And I loved every minute of it. (Bioshock rambling)"">
Honestly, outside of Halo 3, I can't really think of any game coming out in 2007 that can challenge Bioshock's bid for game of the year. Virtually everything about Bioshock makes it seem as though many long months of deliberation and refinement went into every aspect of it -- from the art deco environments to the RPG-style character development to the utterly brilliant sound design.

If you have even scarce access to this game, play it. Even if the thought of playing another first-person shooter makes you nauseous. I guaran-damn-tee that you've never played anything quite like Bioshock. 

There is an elephant in the room, of course. Most of the reviews coming out so far have kept the game's philosophical musings at arm's length. This is a kind of understandable (Maybe they didn't want to alienate potential readers or risk revealing key plot points), but it would have been nice to see a reviewer or two take a stab at it.

For what it's worth (as I do my best not to spoil the story), I didn't detect from the storyline any overall endorsement of Randian ethics. To me, the game argues that Rapture's unwavering faith in its citizens and the free market ultimately led to its downfall. Virtually unlimited access to genetic enhancements, questionable business tactics, and a constant need for lower-class workers to keep the wheels turning can make for a rather nasty cocktail.</lj-cut>

We'll see. I just hope that if I get one, I'm not tempted to use it all the time.

My friends are total enigmas sometimes. They live in an area where there is actually shit to do, and yet they do practically nothing but go to their jobs and loaf around watching anime (which I don't mind, but fer fuck's sake, get the hell out every so often). And when we head out to eat, it's always to the same one or two places we've been dozens of times. 

Some people just don't know how good they have it. I really think they should see what it's like where I came from, where there is <b>abso-fucking-lutely nothing</b> to do, and where it's much cheaper to live, so they could maintain almost the exact same lifestyle without the high rental rates.

"event","<lj-cut text=""...or, 'I Saw Transformers Yesterday and it Kinda Blew'"">
I've seen enough Michael Bay movies to know what to expect. The characters are barely serviceable, one-dimensional archetypes whose lines don't do much more than fill in plot points and provide cheap comic relief. The action scenes are in heavy supply, complete with massive explosions eye-popping effects. The cinematography is typically handled by a pre-adolescent boy fed three gallons of Rockstar Energy Drink and then given free reign over a Go Kart with a camera strapped to his back.

I knew all of this, and yet I still held out hope. The ironic thing about ""Transformers"" is that it really spent way too much time trying to develop the human characters before things really got going. It's as if Bay forgot that, hey, the Autobots and Deceptikons have personalities, too. The simple truth is that, a lot of the time, it didn't really feel like the title characters were the stars of the film. Case in point, there's a neat chase scene between Bumblebee and Barricade that looks as though it's about to culminate in an epic rumble between two giant robo--hey wait why the fuck am I watching these high schoolers have a moment when there are <i>two robots fighting like 30 feet away?!</i> 

Say what you will about cost being the deciding factor. I paid to see ""Transformers"", not ""Humans vs. Deceptikons"" goddamnit.

I won't bother to go into the crack-addled camera work or the constantly changing sense of scale (how do average-sized eyeglasses all of a sudden get 100 times larger to fit between Optimus' fingers?). 

Ugh, the more I reflect on this movie, the more I hate it. I'd better just stop now.</lj-cut>

"event","<lj-cut text=""Yeah, so AX pretty much sucked."">

<b>Registration Lines:</b> Fucking ridiculous. What is the purpose of pre-registering for a con if we're forced to sit in line for hours with the people who <i>didn't</i> pre-reg? It was as though they hadn't even considered the typically high volume of people that AX receives on a yearly basis. Fuck's sake, even the attendees who had their badges mailed to them had to languish in the heat with all the other schlubs. 

<b>Stupid Logistics:</b> I've come to expect this from AX, but man, when the only exit out of the dealer's room is all the way on the other side of the hall, and when you are forced to then walk all the way around the girth of the convention center to get back to the main area, something is seriously out of whack. And why does AX insist on placing the arcade and console gaming areas so far away from each other year after year?

<b>Half...Nay, Quarter-assed Main Event Coordination:</b> Case in point: My friends and I stood in line for hours to watch the AMV contest, only to find out that the coordinator had most of the content stolen, meaning we would only be seeing one category of videos for the evening. 

First off, as any idiot knows, in this day and age there is absolutely no excuse to not keep several backup copies of your work in the case of something like this happening. 

Secondly, sitting in the heat for hours just to find out that you'll only be seeing a fraction of the show is not anyone's idea of a good time. It's beyond me why none of the attendees in line were informed of the difficulties beforehand. Thanks to this retardation, I missed dinner with friends so I could watch 30 minutes' worth of AMVs. <i>Awesome</i>.

Funny thing. As we waited, a staffer with a megaphone went through the line, telling everyone that cameras would not be allowed and that they would have to leave the line and take their cameras back to their cars or hotel rooms before being admitted. Several minutes later, the same person told us that cameras <i>would</i> be allowed as long as they were kept in bags. I can only wonder how many people walked angrily back to their rooms/cars, then came back to find out they didn't have to anyway.

<b>Sunburns AAAAAAAAAGGGGGG:</B> Yes, I put on sunblock. Unfortunately it was still crazy hot, and my Scandinavian DNA only recognizes my skin as either ""lily white"" or ""charred beyond repair"". Guess which one I settled for.</lj-cut>

I won't go into detail about the Masquerade clusterfuck (mostly staff fuck-ups, as usual). But I will say that after last night, ""300"" references have probably surpassed the ""O RLY"" owl as the Fad to Become Passe the Quickest.

Overall, though, it was a good trip. It's always fun to hang around and shoot the shit with people you don't get to see very often. I pretty much measure the value of my trips by how many more in-jokes my friends and I have after it's over. 

I'd have to say this one was worth the trouble. Even if I'll never eat clam chowder again. 

And I <i>love</i> clam chowder."

If you would, please feast your eyes at the still frame of the YouTube clip embedded below.

That is my dad, circa 1970. He was in a rock band called Crabby Appleton at the time, who actually had a Top 40 hit in the summer of that year. This video came from a taping of the variety show ""Something Else"". They also played at least once on ""American Bandstand"", but sadly YouTube has failed me and no video of that performance exists online as of yet.

My dad plays drums, and yes, he makes those facial expressions on-stage to this day. There are some other funny bits in here as well, namely toward the end, where the band is walking back toward the boat and you can see my dad in the back of the line playing ""air drums"". We've had plenty of good laughs about this video since I first saw it on VHS tape several years ago, and you can all now bask in the glorious kitsch. Enjoy!

So my new external hard drive came in yesterday, and not a moment too soon. Ever since my previous one bit the dust about a month ago, my hard drive space seemed almost always to be running out. Trust me when I say that it isn't wise to place a relatively fragile piece of equipment on top of a precariously stacked pile of DVDs sitting on your desk. 

Anyway, I'm pretty eager for AX, even though I invariably run into issues regarding scheduling and whatnot. I've said this every year since I first went in 2004, but I may not go back in 2008. Nowadays it's almost a trade show, and each year has seen AX get larger and more corporate-minded. I can't walk 10 feet through it without having a Bandai, ADV, Geneon or Funimation logo plastered in front of me. I'd rather not fathom how sponsor-driven it'll be by, say, 2010.

Unfortunately, it's the only west-coast convention that my out-of-town friends travel to. It's high time I started convincing them to go to Fanime instead. At the very least it'll save me a ton in travel expenses. ;P

On a completely unrelated note, I think Napple Tale is my favorite Yoko Kanno soundtrack. ""Dreams in a Pie"" FTW."

"event","So the other day I'm lurking the Anime Expo forums, curious about the guidelines for the console gaming room. I am not at all surprised to find out that joysticks are once again banned from console play, but this post in defense of the ban amused me:

<i>""I'm sorry that you feel that way. Our tournaments are for fun, we aren't and don't claim to be serious tournaments like Evo. We want all attendees to enter regardless of skill. As for the stick arguement, I'm not going into it again. I've mentioned why for over 4 years and my staff is not going to change our decision. I just spent over 4400 dollars SO FAR on the room just with systems and games. We aren't going to be responsible for anyone elses equipment.""</i>

That's some great logic there. People who use pads are playing for ""fun,"" but those of us accustomed to playing on joysticks are being too ""serious."" I guess we're just a bunch of surly curmudgeons who wish we could have as much fun as all those uppity pad players.

Apparently it is also insurmountably difficult to post a disclaimer somewhere that attendees are responsible for their own equipment, meaning the only remaining option is to buy joysticks for everyone to use.

While fun, it got off to a rocky start after there was apparently some kind of computer fuck-up, resulting in there being no confirmation that I paid for my pre-registragion badge. That was kind of a pisser after standing in line for over an hour Friday night.

Other than that, <lj-cut text=""here's how it went."">

<b>AMV Contest</b>: Didn't go. Strangely, I didn't have much of an inclination to go either, which could be an indication that I'm either (a. going to have to find a new way to make conventions interesting, or (b. losing my taste for them altogether.

<b>Masquerade</b>: I actually stayed for the entire thing, which is the only other time I'd done so since my first Fanime in 2003. I guess that means I enjoyed it? Also, ""FOOOOUUUUURRRRR!!!!""

<b>MusicFest</b>: There was only one band I intended to see (<a href=""http://www.myspace.com/gos"">God of Shamisen</a>), and I missed their set because I'm a moron and misread the schedule. The guys in the band told me it went well, though. I did get to see a couple of acoustic performances, though, and they got great reactions from the crowd.

<b>Hanging around with a significantly inebriated fellow in a tiger suit</b>: Yeah, pretty much.</lj-cut>

Also had some good times with a bunch of people I hadn't seen in a while, which is always good.

Sadly, there are no pictures from my end because I forgot to take my camera with me, but there were more than enough photographers (both professional and amateur) in attendance so I'm not gonna stress about it.

Also, seeing idiots at conventions parading around as ""Anonymous"" from 4chan is getting pretty tiresome. Is affiliation with a site where hardly anyone has the balls to even use a screenname <i>really</i> something to be proud of?

"event","I found a project for the summer: completely rework my picking technique. I've decided to phase out the forearm usage and focus on using my wrist. I hope to at least play scales of 16ths at 160 bpm by the end of September, a goal I think is well within my reach. 

Not sure why I felt the need to post this, but it's my LJ and I'll cry if I want to."

I fuckin' caught something from someone. Now my throat hurts like crazy, and whenever my head is uncomfortable, so is the rest of me. Oh well. At least this happened at the start of the weekend so I can get lotsa rest.

I like tea."

"event","<lj-cut text=""So I finally got around to playing this Twilight Princess thing (minor spoilers)"">...and uh, so far I'm not as blown away by it as most everyone else was. For one thing, I find playing as the wolf a little rote and tedious. If there was a little more variety in the gameplay I could deal with it, but it's basically just bare-bones platforming with a little combat and an Easter egg hunt thrown in. 

Playing as Link is thankfully, a lot more fun, aside from the combat mechanics being somewhat of a letdown. Holding the Z-trigger and flicking my wrist to swing the sword really doesn't seem any more immersive than holding the Z-trigger and pushing a button instead. Even if you factor in the minor difference in slashes by swinging in a different direction, there's no real incentive to make the extra effort anyway. 

The camera also swings way off-kilter at times, and I find that I have to re-center it way too often. Come on, Nintendo. I know there's no such thing as a perfectly working camera, but you've been at this long enough to not let these kinds of things slip by. Not to mention that you're technically still working with Gamecube hardware, so the unfamiliarity excuse has long since passed its shelf life.

Also, the nunchuk REALLY needs a D-pad. The analog stick works fine most of the time, but even the slightest angling of it can send you careening into a lava pit even though you'd swear you were going straight.

All that said, it's still a solid game, and I'm only a few hours in so maybe I'll warm up to it more as I get further.</lj-cut>

"event","No update in almost two weeks. I can be such a lazy ass sometimes.

Anyway, springtime temperatures abound, as evidenced by the fact that it's been sweltering in here the last couple of days. Today was the first time I turned on the A/C in a very, very long time.

So far, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the best anime series to come out in a while, although Dennou Coil has all kinds of hype around it. I like Darker Than Black so far, too, but it remains to be seen how compelling it'll be in the long run. I will, however, watch anything with a Yoko Kanno soundtrack.

Now, for some din-din."

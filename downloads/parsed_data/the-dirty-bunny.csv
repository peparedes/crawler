"event","Before work this morning, I watched a little stand up comedy I'd TiVo'd.  I didn't really enjoy it as much as some other stuff I've listened to lately (more below), but there was one gem:

""Glitter is the herpes of craft supplies.""

I have to agree.  Use it once, and it'll never go away.  You'll find it in the oddest places in your home, on your body, etc.

I've been listening to stand up so much lately to try to reduce tension.  I figured if I walked to work laughing and smiling, rather than dreading the day or fretting about dumb people talking on their cell phones who almost hit me while making illegal left turns against a light, my days might be easier, I might get fewer headaches, and I might be a better boyfriend.  So far, Dane Cook, Wanda Sykes, and Mike Berbiglia have been keeping me smiling."

"event","One month ago today, I found a gigantic cell phone on the ground outside the Quarter Lounge.  I was walking to work, it was rainy, and I saw it laying in the mud while I strolled down Madison.

At the time, the phone wouldn't even attempt to turn on.  The next day, it had dried out and would turn on, but didn't have enough battery life for me to get into the phonebook and try to track down the owner.

I posted a listing on Craigslist and used an email list at my company to try to track down someone with a compatible charger I could use.  The Craigslist post only resulted in an email from someone who's son lost a RAZR - despite my clear description of the phone.  The search for a charger led me to drop the phone off with a coworker, who took it home believing that the charger she had for her newer phone of the same style would work.  Sadly, it didn't - leaving me with a giant phone that wouldn't turn on.  Charger-woman also suggested that I swing by a Sprint store, cuz they might be able to help me.  I kept meaning to, but just didn't find the time during the busy holidays and all.  Eventually, I took it out of my bag and left it in our home office.

This morning, on a whim, I tried turning it on.  It turned on and I was able to dig into the phonebook for the first time - pulling out numbers listed for 'My Number', 'Jessica' (speeddial #2), 'Jenna/Dave' (also on speeddial), Amanda (near the top of the list), and a number for a name that matches a guy I had a drunken 1-night-stand with many, many years ago.

I just called 'My Number', fearing it would just take me to voicemail for the crappy old phone.  Amazingly, I was connected to a real live person (male), who confirmed he'd lost a big old cellphone.  I asked if he wanted it back, and he said 'I guess'.  So I gave him my home number, though he didn't have a way to write it down.  I told him if I didn't hear back, I'd give him a call again.  He really didn't seem that surprised or appreciative that I'd been trying to track him down for a month.  Maybe he was just distracted.

A year or two ago, I found a phone and got it back to the owner before he had to get a new one... and he gave me a bottle of wine to say thanks.

Last year, <lj user=seaoutcast> found a driver's license on the ground near Group Health and I used MySpace to track down the person and return it.

I kinda enjoy solving the mystery."

<p>Somehow, about a year ago, I got nominated to work with my company's HR department to get our Gay/Lesbian/Bi/Trans employees organized into an official 'affinity group'.  It's been really challenging at times, but sometimes something happens that makes it all worth it.
<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/yf482a"">Lambert House Wish List</a>
<p>Back in October, I scored a spot on a team going to NYC for a LGBT MBA conference.  It was a fun time (great travel buddies) and professionally rewarding - but I think the most important thing to come out of it was an idea one of my companions came up with to use Amazon.com's Wish List feature to promote donations to Lambert House (Seattle's only LGBTQ Youth Drop-in Center).  Long story short, the idea worked out and over 20 items have already been purchased for them - from paper towels to gay DVDs.  There's lots more available to buy for them to help out this great community center - and it just takes a few clicks and a few bucks to make some mini-homos very happy.
<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/yf482a"">Lambert House Wish List</a>
<p>I've gone and cooked dinner for the kids, my parents used to bring down dinners for them, and when I was 17 I slow danced to 'Crazy for You' with a hot boy from Montana with a scar on his face at a post-parade Pride dance at the house.  I truly believe it serves an important role in our city.

It's called <a href=""http://www.cafmet.com/"">Cafe Metropolitan</a>, and the best way I can describe it is a cross between <a href=""http://www.eldoradoreno.com/dining/tivoli.aspx"">Tivoli Gardens</a> (in the El Dorado Hotel & Casino in Reno), and the <a href=""http://www.caesars.com/paris/lasvegas/"">Paris Hotel & Casino</a> in Las Vegas.

<img src=""http://www.cafmet.com/images/site/bg_main.jpg"" width=""400"">

The place is COMPLETELY designed to look like a little side street in Paris, with the hanging strings of lights, wine barrel tables, faux building facades on the walls, and the bar is broken up well into little spaces, each dilineated by very open walls that keep the visual space seeming large, but also make each little space seem cozy and unique.  I hung out in the room that has big fancy wood and velvet couches and chairs and the fake fireplace.  There's a full coffee bar that I assume is open during the day hours, and a full bar.  Oh, yeah, and a fucking fountain in the middle of the place.  It's so Reno/Vegas and I LOVE IT.

Did I mention they had a 25 cent beer special, $3 pitchers, and free Pool and Darts?  Crazy cheap.

Go there.  Go there now.  Leave your homes and offices and go to Cafe Metropolitan.  It's brilliant and must be supported so I can hang out there often.

Cafe Metropolitan is at 1701 E Olive Way - just up the street from B&O Espresso.  And no, I don't know anyone who works there... I just love the over-the-top decor."

Got up early.  Made a bite to eat.  Did a little work.  Tried to make sure Dan was comfortable, despite his awful fever/sore throat/cough plague.

Went to Home Depot.  Bought myself a 10"" Laser Miter Box Saw, some sawhorses, new safety glasses, a t-square, some clamps, a magnetic broom, and a new shelf.  Looking forward to building something - maybe a bench w/ storage for the deck.

Went to Public Storage.  Arranged for a new, bigger unit to store sets, props, costumes, etc.  Moved all my Burning Man gear from my old unit to the new unit.  Nice people there at PS - very friendly and funny.

Went home.  Installed the new shelf in the pantry.  Dan was feeling a bit better, so I convinced him to come down to the pool with me while I swam.  Dan got too hot and went back upstairs.  Thought about inviting friends over to swim, but they were all at a BBQ.  I layed in the sun awhile and drank a Corona.

Ran to the store to get stuff for dinner.  Dan watched Food Network all day and had some great ideas.  Made cajun shrimp kebabs and pepper/onion kebabs on the grill, lemon spinach couscous, and a cucumber salad.  Made a banana boat to share with Dan, using graham crackers, chocolate, pecans, and frosting (as we had no marshmallows).

Watched some TV.  Saw 'House' for the first time.  Something about Munchausen's.

Craig came and grabbed me after he left the aforementioned BBQ, and we met up with Josh at Kozak's.  Had 1.5 vodka sodas.  Talked to Josh about helping with ideas for how to do insect projects with his new kids.  VERY excited about that.  My head is filled with stuff they can do.

Went home.  Found a book of entomology projects for all ages and flipped through it, getting more ideas for Josh.  Went to bed.  Put in earplugs to block out Dan's coughing and the fireworks."

Then my aunt Ellen and uncle Jim, my Dad's old Navy buddy Charlie & his wife Lorraine, and my parent's adopted grandkids and their two Moms showed up.  A nice big crowd.  The grandkids are triplets - Liam, Darby, and Ellie - and just about to turn 4 years old.  Last time I saw them we all went to the zoo together and had a blast.  Now they're talking A LOT (particularly Liam) and much more autonomous.  My Mom got some bubble wands and bubble guns and the kids had a blast.  Liam and I worked together using a screwdriver to open the bubble gun, put in the batteries, and close it back up.  He's a bright kid.  I really enjoy playing with them.  Their Mom's kept asking when Dan & I were gonna get some of our own... and joking that we could borrow one of theirs anytime we want.  I imagine 3 at once is a lot to handle.

"event","I woke up this morning and realized that all the remaining posters and fliers laying around are officially obsolete as of 10:30pm tonite, when the final night of <a href=""http://www.capitolhillhigh.com/"">THE SHOW</a> plays at CHAC.  So what to do when you only have 12 hours til something has no value beyond that of a historical reference?  Well, go on a crazy marketing blitz, of course!

I had already been thinking of some creative postering concepts, and an idea for a final round of teaser posters to make light of our not-so-great review in El Stranger, so I decided to take to the streets.  I made up about 25 teaser posters.  That's our catchy phrase for cheap, 8.5x11 posters on BRIGHT-ASS colored paper, so named because they're the first posters we start putting up for the show, before any of the official ones are up, and they have weird phrases that catch people's attention, but little information besides CAPITOL HILL HIGH and the web address.  Anyway, we've been adding more & more info to them as the show has gone on, so I made some that say:

CAPITOL HILL HIGH
IT'S NO 'SHOWGIRLS',
BUT IT'S STILL REALLY FUNNY!

FINAL NIGHT!  SATURDAY, JULY 1ST @ 10:30 PM
CHAC LOWER LEVEL - 1621 12TH AVE (12TH & PINE)
www.capitolhillhigh.com.

I hit the streets with these, a stack of a couple hundred fliers (maybe), and 5 posters, with the aim not of blanketing the hill, but of creating some very specific arty, attention grabbing telephone pole art.

It took me some time to figure it out, but I realized that if I staple two fliers, one at it's bottom and one at it's top, essentially on top of each other, I can make them stick out from the pole at a right angle like a spine.  So I started doing rings around poles... then a block of them... then I created my masterpiece: A pole with about 50 fliers spiraling around the pole at an angle from the ground up to a No Parking sign.  It was a blank pole, so I was taking a risk of it being pulled down, but I figured if I got a few people to see it before that, it would be worthwhile.  After finishing it, I did a few more 3-D poles (including one by the offices of El Stranger, where I used two bright orange teaser posters and made them stick out from the pole at a right angle using fliers as a support system), then I headed back to make sure my masterpiece was still in tact.  It was, though someone had already taken one of the fliers -- IT WORKED!

Anyway, here's a couple pictures of my two favorite poles:

<img src=""http://www.tbcseattle.com/pics/pole1.jpg"">
This one's between Pike & Pine on 13th, just across from the Storage place and down the block from the Cuff.  I walk by here every day on the way to work, and noticed that posters NEVER get taken down (there was one still up from January).

<img src=""http://www.tbcseattle.com/pics/pole2.jpg"">
My masterpiece.  Cameraphone pictures don't do it justice, but it's pretty cool (if I do say so myself).  Nothing else on the pole, just a spiral of flier spines.  It's on Pike between 12th and 13th, across the street from ReLoad Bags, just up the street from 1200 bistro.

Today was the first time I started taking cameraphone pictures and sending them to my email... since I didn't know I could do that before.  I'll probably get charged $5 a picture or something, but it's worth it to have a couple pictures.

One the way home, these three exhausted looking people jokingly offered me $20 to help them move.  I declined, smiled and laughed, and walked a little farther.  Then I realized it would probably be kinda fun and good exercise, so I went back and helped them move for a half-hour or so.  It was hard work in the hot sun, but it felt good.  They just moved down from Bellingham (where I went to College, too), so we chatted a bit about that.  I told them about the show tonite, and they seemed genuinely interested.  Maybe they'll come on down after they get settled?  (For the record, I declined their offer of $$).

As a side note, I actually saw D.S. perform his annotated 'Showgirls' thing many years back at what was the 'Little Theater' up on 19th, and it was hilarious.  I also went to see him do the same schtick with the Ellen DeGeneres/Bill Pullman film, ""Mr. Wrong"".  It didn't stand up as well, in my opinion.  Maybe the gimmick was worn out, maybe the film just didn't have the same potential, or maybe I just wasn't in the right space for it that day.  I tend to put a lot of weight on a person's mindstate when they see something whether they'll enjoy it or not."

The show apparently went REALLY well last night, and some of the cast and <lj user=seaoutcast> went out to party afterwards.

I'm glad I did, cuz when <lj user=seaoutcast> got home at 2:30AM!!! and had <lj user=spencert> in tow (he didn't want to walk all the way home so he crashed on our couch), I was oblivious.  I think I woke up for like a second, then rolled back over.

Tonite, I'm laying low again, cuz the rest of the weekend is going to be CRAZY.  I've got to pull the decorations together tomorrow for the biggest and bestest party EVER after the show tomorrow - <a href=""http://www.tbcseattle.com/chh/detension.html"">DE-TENSION!  A party for Naughty Boys and Bad Girls of all persuasions</a>.  If you're looking for something fun to do tomorrow nite, I'd highly recommend it.  It sounds like everyone and their mother is coming out to <a href=""http://www.capitolhillhigh.com"">THE SHOW</a> tomorrow nite and sticking around to party like high school kids.  The party's boasting the turntable magic of DJ Curtis (whom I like to call Superstar DJ Curtis, which makes him smile), Go-Go Dancers on POLES, some fun Prizes, and much much more!  It starts right after the show at midnite, then goes 'til 3am.  And you know we'll be heading to TB afterwards.  I need to get my costume pulled together, but I plan to go as a special education student.  I bought a stunning Scooby Doo backpack today, but failed to find the helmet I was hoping for.

I'm gonna have to monitor myself at <a href=""http://www.tbcseattle.com/chh/detension.html"">DE-TENSION!</a>, though, cuz a dedicated group of us are getting up early and dressing up like pregnant cheerleaders to pass out flyers and buttons and stickers and shit at the Pride Parade Downtown.

But I digress.  Sunday afternoon, <lj user=seaoutcast> is planning on the annual tradition of 4pm drinks at The Elite.  I pray I can hold on that long.  Last year, I was asleep by 2pm.

"event","It seems to me that people in Seattle work very hard to insult things they don't like or understand, but do far too little to appreciate those things they enjoy.  Is the culture of this city such that people feel like they'll be rewarded or respected more for being abusive?  Or perhaps it's just that it takes more intellect to be witty and positive than it does to be witty and negative.  Maybe it's not unique to Seattle.  I've never lived elsewhere, so my frame of reference is limited.

I'm sure I've been at fault for the same thing in the past.  I try to be a positive person, but sometimes I fall into the age-old trap.  I think homos are even more prone to it -- great role models for saying positive, uplifting things don't really abound.  But more are popping up.

There's a Buddhist (I believe) mindfulness training that I try to remind myself of often, but too often fail.  The goal is to not let any words escape your lips that are not True, Kind, AND Necessary.  Although the second and third conditions (Kind and Necessary) can be subjective, I suspect the originator of the practice would lean toward not speaking when there is any ambiguity over the kindness or necessity of the words.

Despite how often I still ramble off at the mouth (like now), I do think that I've made great strides in the past 4 years.  True, Kind, and Necessary - Not always, but more often than not, I hope.  I'm seriously thinking of having those words tattooed on me somewhere I can see them, in a lowercase, typewriter font.  Conveniently, *true*kind* has the same number of characters as *necessary*, so I think they'd be very balanced.

Oh yeah... if you've seen <a href=""http://www.capitolhillhigh.com/"">THE SHOW</a>, think about writing something about it at <a href=""http://seattleperforms.com/index.php?option=com_nathevents&show_id=1673&action=details&editsection=write_review"">SeattlePerforms.com</a>.  So far, only two very nasty reviews have been written, which doesn't seem to represent all the positive feedback we've received about it.  Pity.

I could write something myself, but that seems misleading."

I figured since I hadn't seen it around the apartment, it must be either in the pool or lost forever.  So I peeked out my bedroom window, and could actually see it sitting at the bottom of the pool.  Despite the rain and cold, I know the pool is about 80 degrees, so I put on my swimsuit, grabbed my goggles, and headed down.  Unfortunately, I was greeted by a sign telling me the pH of the pool is out of whack, and PLEASE don't go in it.

Whatever.

I jumped in and dove down to the bottom, grabbed my ear 'ring', and got the fuck out.

Sadly, the pH WAS really screwed up, and my nice off-white walrus bone plug is now green... just like what happens to blond hair if you spend too much time in overly chlorinated pools.

"event","What a rollercoaster ride...

After months of preparation (rehearsals, sewing costumes, production meetings, building sets, negotiating contracts, designing marketing materials, etc), the time finally came for an audience to see <a href=""http://www.capitolhillhigh.com/"">THE SHOW</a>.  Thursday night was our preview, with about 20 friends of the cast and crew there to help prepare the show for an audience.  I've learned that one of the biggest challenges of comedy is timing... delivering lines at the just the right pace, keeping energy up and laughs coming, and also knowing when to pause for laughter.  Quite a lot to remember on top of lines and blocking and everything else.  Anyway, the preview went great - lots of laughs and the cast did a great job.

Then came 'Opening' night.  Friday we officially opened to the public, and had an even larger crowd.  The cast once again did a great job, but there was just something off about the audience.  Maybe it's because so many of them were there in an 'official' capacity (Stranger reviewers), or maybe there was something I missed, but the laughs were just not flowing out loud and free.  I later learned that at least a couple of the people who came to our opening aren't fans of non-PC humor, which abounds in <a href=""http://www.capitolhillhigh.com/"">THE SHOW</a>.  <a href=""http://www.capitolhillhigh.com/"">THE SHOW</a> also pokes fun at The Stranger on more than a few occasions (one of the characters is the music editor of the school paper - The Stranger - and gets in some playful jabs, so maybe that was too much for that crowd to handle.  Hard to say.  All we knew was we were suddenly presented with a crowd that was not openly appreciating the comedy.  Ick.  Not a great way to open, and not a great crowd for a reviewer to be in the midst of.

But last night, we were redeemed.  Another great performance by the cast and crew, and the audience got it.  LOTS of laughs -- more than ever -- and I swear I could see it pump up the cast.  It was really great to see.  I actually text'd <lj user=""seaoutcast""> during Act 1 to tell him to come down, cuz he needed to end the weekend on a positive note about the play.  All the jokes were getting huge laughs - as well they should - and my costumes were getting plenty of laughs, too.  I'm really proud of my costumes for Guy -- and the first time he's on stage the audience roars with laughter each night.  That's a good feeling.

After the show, a bunch of us went up to Karaoke at Kozak's.  I was itchin' to sing 'Cherry, Cherry' by Neil Diamond, but didn't get there in time to sing.  But I love watching everyone else perform, so no big loss.  Plus, I have this awful cough/cold/sinus thing, so singing probably wouldn't be the best idea."

You just sign up for an account, and you can adjust your settings to allow viewing of 'adult' content.  Free porn?  Not bad.  Lots of homegrown stuff, but also lots of bootlegged pro stuff.  But if you're interested, you've probably already stopped reading this and signed up.

The point?  Today I ran across something that falls in that category of 'disturbing, but I can't stop looking at it'.

I also ran by the Starbucks by Crate & Barrel in University Village today to see my design work on display.  Jason did a great job of hanging my little pencil drawings and things, and called excited this morning at 8:30am to tell me people were already asking about the show.  Let's hope his bosses aren't put off by me framing flyers from the show... I DID design them, so I think it's legit.  They're up all June long, so check 'em out if you're buying Crates or Barrels or whatever it is they sell over there.

As a warning to one and all... the seal has officially broken on the part of me that's all about marketing <a href=""http://www.capitolhillhigh.com/"" target=""CHH"">THE SHOW</a>.

I was happy to see that the party I've been dreaming of for years wasn't too ambitious.  I don't know why I love things that light up so much, but it was all just so damn pretty to me.  Maybe it's the E flashbacks.

It's a queer writers reading/spoken word series that's been going on there for a long time, and is pretty damn successful.  Some big names have read there, so it's kinda weird that I'm reading -- since I'm not a writer.

Even weirder is what I'll be reading... other people's cyber sex conversations, collected over the past 5 years.  I put together a zine called Sticky Keyboard a couple years back, but never really put it out there.  Josh found out about it, read a copy, and wanted me to read from it.  Should change the tone of the Spit for the night... none of that usual 90's slam poetry meter in this.

<lj user=""seaoutcast""> and I will be reading the chat interactions together, like a staged reading, but we're going to try to strip all the emotion out of them.  The stories I've chosen are a bit odd, but I think they'll be funny.  Here are some outtakes...

""You water your tomato patch.  Are you ready for my fresh produce?""

""lick more of ur pussy and slap ur swt ass""

""my hands runing over ur huge boobs""

"event","I've been working really long hours the past few weeks at the 'zon, and just hit my vacation time cap, so my boss okay'd me taking today off.

Ironically, I just looked at the clock and realized I've been sitting at my computer for over 9 hours working on design stuff for Capitol Hill High, Episode Two: The Twin Has Spoken (which I will refer to from now on as ""The Show"").  Time flies when you're doing something you enjoy, I guess.

Today's been spent mostly working on <a href=""http://www.capitolhillhigh.com"">the new web site for ""The Show""</a>.  A couple features (tickets and merchandise) are currently hidden, but the rest of the content is essentially there.  I think it's a bit cleaner than the last one.  Always learning.

We had a meeting on Tuesday and I found out the marketing team needs the Poster and Flyer designs completed by the end of April, so that they can get them printed and have them ready for a May 9th deadline.  I had a mini-panic attack, then got to work.  I'd already come up with the concept, and Josh gave me a good color idea, so I knocked out the design in a few hours that night and early the next morning before work.  I bounced them off the marketing folks, and got mixed responses.  The first person to respond said they were 'pretty good', and gave me a lot of suggestions for revisions, which left me crestfallen.  Fortunately, <lj user=""seaoutcast""> and <lj user=""craigtrolli""> both said they liked the design.  I made some edits based on the negative feedback, and this is the current status (reduced down from a 12x17 300dpi PSD file, mind you):

<img src=""http://www.tbcseattle.com/chh/poster_proof_060413.jpg"">

I've never taken a design class or been trained on Photoshop or anything, so I think I'm doing alright.  I like it better than last show's poster -- which ended up a little too dark and not contrasty enough to 'POP' when you see it from a distance.  Ever since I've been keeping my eye on posters and trying to figure out what works and what doesn't.  Hopefully I successfully incorporated some of what works into the new design.

Oh yeah... COME SEE THE SHOW!  IT OPENS IN JUNE!!!

(And if you know any actors or actresses interested in joining the cast, we're having auditions next week.  Have them contact <lj user=""seaoutcast""> for details.)"

"event","I can't believe I haven't written a live journal in 10 days.  I suppose <lj user=""yeswad""> must be very disappointed in me.  

It makes me realize how busy I've been in my new/old job.  It's nice that my days go by very quickly, but I miss having the time to check my personal email and pontificate on this thing.  I suppose that's not what they're paying me for, but I should probably set aside a few minutes a day for some ME time... just so I'm not burning myself out.  <lj-cut text=""more"">I do tend to have lunch with friends a few times a week, which really has become a wonderful part of going to work.  When I work from home I get bummed that I miss out on those lunches.  Today Colin (formerly of Man or Astroman, Infomatik, etc.) and Curtis (formerly of The Jeunes, and currently DJ extraordinaire at Low Life) and I hit the Zum Court for Thai/Burritos and then chowed down in the food court of our building.  I mention their musical affiliations because today we got in a very detailed discussion of progressive rock in the 60's and 70's, sparked by a question I had about contemporary Math Rock bands.  I'm pretty ignorant to all things musical, but seem to be blessed with lots of DJ friends who fill in those voids for me.  It's all so interesting to me, and my lunchtime companions were like encycopedias.  They even made me understand why the Beatles and the Beach Boys were so darn pivotal, beyond the screaming girls.

Despite a great, informative lunch, I'm actually feeling pretty gross today.</lj-cut>  I started getting a cough thing yesterday (my cold from early March sneaking back up on me), and woke up with a pretty bad headache this morning.  By afternoon, the cough was worse and the headache was TERRIBLE.  By 5pm, every time I coughed my head felt like it was exploding again and again, like aftershocks of blinding pain.

<lj-cut text=""more"">Anyone who knows me well knows that I've dealt with my share of headaches.  I tend to have them all the time, and far too often they turn into migraines.  For perspective, I had one migraine that lasted for 2 1/2 weeks straight.  Turns out my posture has degraded so much due to sitting at a computer for the past 7+ years that my head juts forward on my neck, causing constant strain that leads to migraines at the drop of a hat.  Ick.  But I digress.  My point is, normally life wouldn't be that bad if I had a headache.  Like my Mom, I've learned to deal with the pain and move on.  But the cough/headache thing is really killing me tonite.

And worst of all, </lj-cut>I was supposed to go with my love (<lj user=""seaoutcast"">) to a fancy TV show premiere party slash PAWS benefit.  I'm not one to get invited to that sort of thing, usually, but Dan's sister had an in.  So I was supposed to be sipping cocktails in a jacket and tie tonite, witnessing what a big hollywood-esque party is all about.  I was eager to see what an event like that is like.  I'm no schmoozer, but I was interested in the level of detail the event planner was going to go to.

But instead, I'm at home.  I popped an endocet, swigged down a Mai Tai, rubbed some vaporub into my chest, and kissed my honey goodbye.  He's still going, so he's obligated to give me all the details.

Speaking of Mai Tai's, I better be feeling better by Saturday night, cuz the next Guerrilla Masquerade Party is this weekend at Kozak's Bar & Grill.  I can't wait to sing some Karaoke.  I've been working on a rendition of 'Cherry, Cherry' by Neil Diamond that I think will be a crowd pleaser.  And I want to continue working on my 'Don't Cry Daddy' number.

"event","For the past (way too many) years I've kept my cassette tape 'collection' in the trunk of my super-stylin' 1993 Ford Tempo sedan.  When <lj user=""seaoutcast""> got rid of his ride, his cassette tape 'collection' ended up joining mine in said trunk.  Sadly, the aforementioned trunk isn't quite waterproof after 13 years of service.  Plus, at some point, a bottle of car wash detergent broke open, tainting some of the cassette tapes.  Perhaps needless to say, getting rid of our (now combined) cassette tape collection was becoming a priority.  About a month ago, I thought that bringing the tapes into the house in a big box would accelerate the process... but instead they just sat in the office.

But today, after a great lunch with my pal Lindsay (visiting from LA), I went through all the tapes, separating them into three piles:

1. We've already got this album (or the important tracks) on our harddrive, or we don't care about this album, therefore trash it.
This included 'We Sold Our Souls to Rock and Roll', 'Sounds of the Everglades', and about a dozen tapes of the 'Power Mix' - C-89's late 90's dance/techno radio show that I listened to and recorded every weekend before heading out to the OZ (an underage nightclub 'in the shadow of the space needle', which later became DV8).

2. We'd like to have this album on our harddrive, so we need to download it.
This included both Suicidal Tendencies and the Indigo Girls self titled albums.

3. We know we can't get this album onto the harddrive (because it's a special mix tape or just hard to find stuff), so we'll keep the tape.
This includes the soundtracks for 'Pretty in Pink', 'Purple Rain', and 'The Lost Boys', as well as a tape of 'Mukilteo Fairies' songs and many, many mixtapes created for me by friends.

I was actually surprised by the size of the 3rd pile.  There are a lot of albums that iTunes just doesn't offer.  Which leads me to the pleading portion of my livejournal...

What are your suggestions of places to download harder to find albums, or the complete albums (where iTunes only offers partials)?

For the curious, the big ol' box of now outdated and unwanted tapes will be going in the dumpster later today, along with some too-ratty-for-even-Goodwill stuffed animals and a beautiful lambskin trenchcoat that I mistakenly decided to dissect for a craft project."

I layed in the dark for awhile, watched a little ""Charmed"" (because I love Rose McGowan), and napped.

I finally crawled out of bed and decided to do something about all the costumes and stuff filling our office post-play.  I opened the three main bins of costumes and started hanging up what's mine, boxing up the things I bought/made for the play that I can't/won't wear myself, making a pile to return to Atlas, putting the things away that were dumped out of the bins initially, and cleaning the blood and stuff of my leather pants.  I can now officially be caught red handed, cuz the fake blood stained my fingers crimson.

The office is still a mess, but we're closer.

I just got a call from a fact-checker at Seattle Magazine, so I guess they still plan to move forward with the article.  Can't wait to see it in glossy print.  They did have one fact wrong... 140 people on the mailing list?  Try 760.  He was a little surprised there are so many freaks in Seattle, I guess.  I suppose their demographic probably doesn't overlap that much with mine, but maybe their readers will spread the word to their friends and relatives who are costume-crazy partiers.

I've been burning the candle at both ends and I think I'm just too wrecked.  No nights out on the town for me for awhile.  I'm gonna lay on the couch and catch up on Tivo and Netflix.

<lj-cut>
We had a cast party after our closing night Saturday, and I got a couple nice closing night gifts from people.  I've been wearing my 'NIHILISM"" wristband from Mary ever since, which seems appropriate given my mood the past few days.  I still have a mini-bottle of Wild Turkey that Jason gave me tucked away in a costume box.  I just haven't had the energy to dig through them all yet, but it'll make a really nice surprise after I forget about it and refind it while looking for my fake-mohawk or my rabbit fur shoulderpads.  I need to return the items we borrowed from Atlas ASAP though.  Jason gave the rest of the cast posters signed by all the people in the cast (but not the writer/director, strangely), but I didn't get one for some reason.  Oh well, I've got unsigned copies at home.  

<lj user=""seaoutcast""> and I put together gift bags for everyone in the cast and crew.  Dan wrote special faux livejournal entries for everyone's character, and put them in homemade cards along with a personal note from him.  I put a couple buttons I had made by <a href=""http://www.seatthole.com/"">Seatthole.com</a>, a t-shirt I designed and had made by <a href=""http://www.cafepress.com/"">Cafepress.com</a>, and a little note to everyone about how much I enjoyed the experience.  

I guess I got the shirt sizes wrong for a lot of people, cuz that's all I really heard when people opened them up.  I learned that it's hard to know what size will be perfect for everyone when you're ordering online from a new company.  They turned out to run a little bigger than I expected, unfortunately, and only came in S-M-L-XL.  I got medium shirts for most of the cast, but I guess I was wrong.  Another reason I shouldn't be a costume designer, I suppose.  Right now I kinda feel like I shouldn't have bothered having the buttons or shirts made, but I thought it was important to make everyone feel appreciated for their hard work, since only a few people are going to be paid.  I'll wear mine, though, and I'm sure <lj user=""seaoutcast""> will wear the one I got for him.  Maybe other people will, too.  I dunno.  Ironically, I had extras in my bag in case anyone asked me about a different size, but so many people were drunk and rude about it I just didn't care to deal with it.  Rodney was really nice and took me aside to thank me, which brought me out of the funk that had sent me to the upstairs bathroom earlier in the party to avoid crying in front of people during a party.  Jeffrey also gave me a big hug and thanked me for my work... which was something he'd done several times during the run, and something I really needed.

I wish I'd known that it's customary for the cast of a play to do something to recognize the writer/director's contribution.  I would've organized something for <lj user=""seaoutcast"">, had I known.    Next episode I'm not in the cast, but maybe I can still help pull something off for him.  This whole theater world traditions thing is new to me.  I guess I've got a lot to learn if I'm going to remain involved in plays.
</lj-cut>
Last night I binged on the leftover junk food from the cast party, which unfortunately ended up in our house.  I ate more chips and cookies than I should eat in a month, all while sitting slumped on the couch.  I really need to get over using food as a crutch when I'm down, but I've got decades of practice, so it's hard to stop."

I created a little forest, then buried it in sand and salt and burned it to the ground, leaving a desert wasteland... all while listening to ""We Don't Need Another Hero"" by Tina Turner (from the soundtrack of the best movie ever, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome)."

"event","Today marks the end of my 7th year (but not the end of my employment) at a certain well-known online retailer based in Seattle, and the beginning of my return to my old job (after the unfortunate elimination of my last department due to a change of priorities).  I couldn't be happier.  Well, I probably could, but I'm really happy.  I missed a lot of these people, and now I'm back working with them.  And I've got a brand spanking new office Downtown.  It's cold and dark and wonderful.  And oddly, I think it smells like a dentist office.  I'm convinced that they're pumping a low dose of nitrous oxide through the HVAC system to keep us all calm and happy.  I have no complaints if they are, cuz I'm pleased as punch.

Last night we did a little postering blitz, as well as a little Karaoke.  I sang ""I Write the Songs"" by Barry Manilow in my most angry voice.  The kids at RPlace didn't really seem to enjoy it, but we had fun nonetheless.  My favorite song, ""Making Love Out Of Nothing At All"", by Air Supply, doesn't seem to be in anybody's books (except the Crescent and Wildrose), which makes me sad.  The karaoke fun moved on to Purr and the Cuff... but I needed sleep.  

And speaking of singing badly in front of strangers... I also sent out info on the next <a href=""http://www.gmpseattle.com/"" target=""other"">Guerrilla Masquerade Party</a>... TROPICARAOKE... yesterday.  I'm hoping for total immersion this time, meaning we not only dress up but we also bring decorations.  If nothing else, it gives me an excuse to swing out to <a href=""http://www.displayandcostume.com"" target=""other"">Display & Costume Supply</a> and go shopping.  I've already got the next party planned, too... and am REALLY excited about it.  All I can say right now is that it will be sparkley.

And speaking of sparkling... have you seen <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/ex/i/7DBB34EAEDFF1028A1FC001143E7E506/"" target=""other"">this</a>?  I think it might be the most beautiful thing I've seen in ages (besides <lj user=""seaoutcast"">, of course)."

Not sure when my daily zen calendar and my kermit the frog doll are going to get moved, but I'm going to start lugging my laptop up to the Bank of America Tower starting tomorrow.  It'll be nice to feel like I'm actually doing something worthwhile, and that I know what I'm doing.  And it'll be really great to be around all the people I've become close friends with at Amazon again.  I'll have people to eat lunch with and talk to again.  8 hours a day with no social interactions was getting to me.

Zolar-X was a let-down.  ""Bad in a Bad Way"" is how it was put, just before we left mid-set.  I could've forgiven the music that's aged badly, and the volume set so loud that I had to wear earplugs because I was in pain... but I can't forgive bad costumes.  They looked like they were supposed to match, but they didn't.  And they had no antennae.  I did see a couple furry pals at the show... I think they were there for the Squirrels.  Rocky Raccoon was out of costume, but I'm pretty sure it was him... and Fractal Squirrel was all dressed up in his amazing costume.  I waved, but I don't think they recognized me without my fur on.  No scritches for me, but that's okay -- I had Amstel Light.  The best part of the night was getting to go to a show with <lj user=""djeltoro"">.  It's been a long time.  Last time we were at that space together, I think, was when we were holding the table steady for Ida No (of Glass Candy) so she could stand on top of it while she sang.  Our pal Curtis was supposed to meet up with us, but he fell asleep after band practice.

Tonite or tomorrow we begin the aforementioned guerrilla postering blitz...  look for this around the hill:

So now we can just tell people to check out capitolhillhigh.com and they're there.  Maybe a little simpler, I dunno.  But definitely another key element of branding Capitol Hill High.

We're also planning a big postering blitz for this week... hundreds of bright orange posters that have the Capitol Hill High logo, and say ""HAVE YOU GRADUATED YET?"" with the new URL below.  I know it's closing weekend, but I love the idea of getting one last big wave of publicity in, and in a way that gets people wondering what Capitol Hill High is exactly.  Curiosity may have killed the cat, but hopefully it'll get people to buy tickets, too.

I'm off to go see Zolar-X at El Corazon.  Zolar-X were like Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars... to the nth degree.  And if I'm remembering my music history schooling from Kurt & Curtis, they preceeded Ziggy.  These guys actually purported to be aliens - on and off stage.  They look like extras from a Star Trek episode and play wacky science and space laden music.  I'm excited to see a little piece of music history... even if it's WAY after the fact.

"event","Today marks my first day sitting in my cubicle without any official job title.  I'm not sure how long this will last, but hopefully not long.  Today I wrote my manager's performance review (despite him not being my manager any longer), and wrote my own performance review focusing on what I did in the past year.  Hopefully I made it clear what I accomplished last year.  With the looming uncertainty around my job right now, it's a little weird to be writing a review... but probably all the more important that I make my contributions clear.

It's now about 11:30am, and I'm not sure what to do the rest of the day.  I'll probably call my old boss and find out what needs to happen for me to move back there.  I might also check in about the 3-month opening that have here in SupplyChain... but I don't really think anything anyone says can get me to stay -- unless I can't take my old job back, that is.

So for now, I'm in limbo.  I guess I'll be playing a lot of internet games, teaching myself PERL, or just writing a lot of livejournal entries for the next few days.  I think I might go next door to the Exhibition Center to check out the home show.  That might waste a few hours.

(BTW - <a href=""http://www.badactorproductions.org/chh/"">THE PLAY</a> is getting huge.  We added more chairs Saturday night, and still had to turn people away because there wasn't anywhere for them to sit.  We'll have to take out more tables and bring in more chairs for this weekend.  Just three more chances to see the show!  If you haven't already, I'd highly recommend <a href=""http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/3010"">buying tickets in advance</a> to secure a spot... and showing up at about 10pm so you can get a good seat.

We were all also pleasantly surprised by some pretty graphic, intimate scenes between Scott Speedman and Kate Beckinsale - minus the blue/grey makeup effects.

Not sure if it was all CGI or if they went with good ol contact lenses, but either way it made for some pretty faces looking even prettier... and ugly faces looking even more frightening.  Makes me think of how I associate really wide open pupils with people looking really youthful and alive and beautiful.  Something to do with the circumstances when people's eyes get that wide open and glossy and dark...

It was fun to go see a 'pretty' fantasy film on the big screen.  <lj user=""seaoutcast""> isn't much of a fan of those films, I think cuz they're driven more by visuals and a simple plot than they are by characters and dialogue.  I don't know that much about film, so I'm not super picky.  If a movie makes me laugh, cry, think, or is just really visually stunning, I'm down.

I think I should sneak a nap in before the show tonite... which means I should lay down now.  BTW - <a href=""http://www.badactorproductions.org/chh/"">THE PLAY</a> REALLY sold out last night.  If any more people had shown up, we would've needed to get into the main stage theater upstairs to borrow chairs.  We put all the chairs from backstage and from the outside smoking area in the theater, and just barely found a spot for everyone.  I'm glad so many people are coming out to see the show.  It makes me proud of all the work everyone put into it, and particularly of <lj user=""seaoutcast""> for writing something so funny."

If you've got love in your sights
Watch out, love bites

When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies and say that it's forever?
Do you think twice, or just touch 'n' see?
Ooh babe ooh yeah...

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Love bites. Def Leppard should know. Meow. Take their word for it,
and take our advice. Come out this Friday, Friday, Friday. It's that
time again. And as promised this month's installment of Guerilla
Queer Bar is very special. Are you tired of all the pink? Are your
colors more than -- much more than -- blush and bashful? Are you
sick of candy hearts and wilting roses and Hallmark card adverts on
the screen, on the radio, on the sides of buses? Are you ready to
slap anything doe-eyed, googly-eyed, or cherub sized? Romance got
you down? Well, then, you're in luck because this Friday Guerillas
will be your Anti-Valentine! Love may be grand and blooming, but
every silver lining needs a cloud. Every sweet, sweet chocolate
needs a little taste of bitter. Two great tastes that taste great
together! Come be 'with' us! A spoon full of sugar (or in this case
a whole boat load of red dye #4) really needs a shot or twelve of
hard knocks! (And who couldn't use a knock or few, hard or soft?)
Cavernous, scarlet-walled, gothic, gargoyled, and thrumming, Club
Noc Noc (1516 2nd Avenue @ Pike, Downtown) is the perfect antidote
for all that Pepto frill and lace. Plus, there's dancing.

Data from the field reports that Noc Noc Fridays boast
the ""Definition"" progressive house party. Come ready to drink and
dance. There is a cover after 9 PM of $5 -- well worth the fun and
fashion. But, if you want to get there early, set your Swatches to
8:30 PM. An early team of Guerillas will be on hand (they might even
share a plate of tater tots with you). Be ready.

Apples & Oranges are being compared and the reality of Mathematics were ignored or simply misunderstood.  People are worrying, even panicking.  People are being insulted.  People are getting sad.  The future is in jeopardy.  [(10 x (99 x 63.3%) x $12) - $2500] will never be equal to [((9 x (55 x 100%) x $10) - $3000)/2].  In fact, if we replace 55 w/ a variable, and set the second equation equal to the first and solve for that variable, it ends up equalling 144.  Since the variable is fixed in a range of 0 to 75, that'll never happen.

"event","Although in a cabaret space it's difficult to define a 'sold out' show, I think it's safe to say Capitol Hill High did just that Saturday night.  The capacity of the room is technically around 50 people, and we exceeded that by quite few... forcing a frantic search for chairs and a slight delay of the show.  Once everyone was settled in, we performed another great night of comedy, if I do say so myself.  Since I'm not on stage much, I feel like it's okay for me to give glowing reviews of the show... I'm usually backstage giggling, anyway.

All weekend I was up until 4-5am each night, partying post-show, having a couple drinks a night, and devouring crappy food before crawling into bed.  Saturday the cast headed up to Kozak's to celebrate <lj user=""spencert"">'s birthday.  I got a Mai Tai -- which I think will now be my official drink of Winter 2006.  It makes me feel tropical.  Plus, carrying the punch from the show home every night has given me a bizarre craving for fruity drinks.  Anyway, after Jason finished the night of Karaoke and Kozak's off with his signature Scissor Sister's number, we headed down to The Cuff for some 'dancing'.  I was sceptical (considering the awful music they play), but I REALLY wanted to dance.  A whole crowd of us made our way down there, and after regrouping out on the patio, we went in and hit the dancefloor.  Somehow, the terrible music didn't spoil our fun, and we tore up the tile until they turned the lights on and forced us out at 4am.  Ade and I discovered we have a lot of fun dancing together, and decided that our characters must secretly go clubbing together.  It was great to burn off some energy (and calories) and finish out such a successful weekend dancing together with big smiles on our faces.  I've never been dancing with most of those people, and it was SO MUCH FUN I want to do it more.  I've really come to love all the people in the cast, and am really happy to get to know so many of them better by spending time together.  After the Cuff kicked us out, we spent another half-hour or more joking around on the sidewalk, then <lj user=""seaoutcast""> and I headed home to eat some tater tots.  

I spent most of Sunday lounging around the house before we headed out to Blake's 6th birthday party.  At the party, Blake & I were largely antisocial playing his new Xbox ATV racing game for hours.  At one point, probably after kicking me off my virtual quad-atv again or doing a wheelie/backflip combo off the wall, Blake turned to me and said this was the best birthday he's ever had.  I really love having nephews thanks to my wonderful boyfriend.

"event","Last night's opening of <a href=""http://www.badactorproductions.org/chh/"">Capitol Hill High</a> went off without a hitch.  The crowd was great, I saw lots of familiar faces contorted in boisterous laughter, and that really fed the energy of the actors, I think.  After rehearsing the same lines and the same jokes for weeks now, the novelty of some of the jokes wore off -- we weren't being surprised by them any longer.  It was GREAT to be reminded of just how funny the script is.  Now we just need to get used to pausing for laughter.  That's what I call a high class problem.  And it was good for me to hear some laughs for my main contributions to the show - sets and costumes.  Cherry, Elsa, and Guy really got great laughs for their outlandish ensembles, and a few people in the audience recognized how anal I was about making the Victrola Coffee menu near-identical to the real one, which caused some chuckles.
<img src=""http://static.flickr.com/17/21373435_cd91dc39e2.jpg"">

The Executive Director of the CHAC was there last night, and mentioned that people around him were laughing so hard they were choking.  Can't beat that.

With the exception of Rodney & I almost knocking over a stack of probably expensive speakers, and me forgetting some of my interlude choreography (how could I forget to lick my balloon boobs?), I think we nailed it.  The dangerously technical choreography of the infamous 'jump rope scene' was flawless... and I don't use that word often.

All the costumes seemed to (mostly) survive opening night, too.  I really need to wash the whipping cream off one of my costumes, but that can wait.  It's just gonna get dirty again.  One of Mary's dresses was starting to show a little damage due to us tugging it over her head night after night, so I spent some time today incorporating a big white zipper that will make it easy on and easy off.  Now I've made two of the costumes in the show into stripper costumes, I suppose.  Makes me want to make all my clothes come off with just the tug of a zipper.  Maybe that's the niche I should try to fill -- stripper clothes.  I think I could do better than this, at least...

I think she's a shallow, self-indulgent kiss-ass with no sense of humor and a degree of blind faith in religion and the Bush administration's nationalist attitudes that only points to what a moron she is.  She may have a law degree, but to say and act the way she does betrays any education she may have.  The entire wedding spectacle was horrifying to me and should've been embarrassing to anyone involved.  She's publicly announced that she doesn't believe an Athiest should be President.  She has a constant air of superiority that makes her seem absolutely disgusting.

And tonite, once again, she's on the Red Carpet at the Emmy's chatting with TV celebrities, kissing their asses and asking them idiotic questions.  It's really sad.  Once again, E! has cordoned Kathy Griffin off away from the celeb's, where her hilarious jokes are a safe distance from the ears of the celebrities they're directed at.  And once again, Star doesn't get any of Kathy's jokes, nor does anyone else.

But there is one good thing about Star Jones tonite:  She finally dressed up to reveal her true identity.  A couple years back, I saw a McDonalds commercial back-to-back with a Payless Shoes commercial, and it made me crack up.  It was at that moment I realized the awful truth.  And tonite, Star's wrinkley purple dress is going to make the truth obvious to a lot more people.

"event","The first fursuit I ever sewed myself has once again received a make-over.  Originally, it was a 3-toed sloth costume for a 7 deadly sins party -- get it, Sloth -- that I wore again for Halloween 2003:

<img src=""http://www.thedans.info/dang/livejournal_pics/frida_sloth_small.jpg"">

Then I added ears and a tail turning it into a Monster Bunny for the <a href=""www.gmpseattle.com/"">Guerrilla Masquerade Party</a> themed 'Monsters of Rock':

<img src=""http://www.gmpseattle.com/050219/photos/1.jpg"">

Then yesterday, I yanked off the bunny tail, added a long pink tail, took off the big claws, and shorted the ears to turn it into a Possum.  <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/craigtrolli/"">Anna Rexia</a> invited me to be a backup dancer for a benefit at The Crescent for Hurricane Katrina.  

We did the Rasputina song 'Possum of the Grotto', with choreography by the wonderful and talented Ian, aided by Jason of Bad Actors Productions.  The crowd seemed pretty receptive -- although the whole benefit aspect wasn't going so well.  They had all sorts of great auction items that no one was bidding on.  I almost scored a $50 gift certificate to McCormick & Schmick's for $20.  I hope things picked up after we left.  Regardless, we had a great time.  We took off soon after our number, but not until Jason did a little (shirtless) karaoke to 'Proud Mary':

<img src=""http://www.thedans.info/dang/possum/26.JPG"">

Afterwards we headed up to another Katrina benefit --  a party at Jerry's place of mostly <a href=""http://www.burningman.com/"">Burners</a> fresh from the playa.  It made me a little sad to see pictures from this year, but also excited about next year.  I'm already making notes and jotting down ideas.  I'd love to put together a cookbook of playa-friendly (quick & easy to prepare, non-perishable foods) recipes, and give it away next year as a gift.  We'll see if I can get myself motivated enough to pull it off.

I met a couple guys from New Orleans at the party, who apparently had left for Burning Man as Katrina was approaching the city, and didn't have homes to return to after the Burn was over.  I can't even imagine what that must be like.  But they seemed in good spirits anyway, and Jerry had told them about GMP -- which they seemed into.  Sounds like they'll be in Seattle for awhile, so hopefully they'll be able to come to the October 15th 'The Good! The Bad! and the Mutated!' Super Hero party.  I just got the invite pulled together and sent out, thanks to our super new computer.  I love having a computer that works again.  No freezing up, no turning itself on and off.  I feel so 21st Century at long last.

After the party we met up with Josh and Sarah at our place, and all of us hung out and watched the Pamela Anderson Roast.  For some reason I decided to make Chocolate Chip Walnut Cookies, with help from Sarah.  They turned out really good, I must say, especially for how drunk I was and how late it was."

"event","And more importantly, starting tomorrow (Sunday, September 4th), Sunday's alright for buying liquor!

Thanks to House Bill 1379, 20 of the State run liquor stores (which is all we have here in Washington) will be open from 12 noon to 5pm on Sundays, providing Sunday isn't a national holiday.  Thankfully, the liquor store on 12th and Pine is one of the 20 stores selected, which is conveniently located about 4 blocks from my house.

At long last, you can buy booze 7 days a week.  Of course, it's only a pilot program -- if sales don't go up overall to compensate for the extra expense of being open 5 more hours a week, or if the sales at these 20 stores appear to be negatively impacting sales at nearby stores, this will be short lived.  In fact, the final report on the success or failure of this pilot program will be presented to the Legislature by January 31st, 2007.  

So I beg of you:  BUY MORE BOOZE BETWEEN TOMORROW and JANUARY 2007.  BUY IT ON SUNDAYS, but be sure to buy it other days too, at locations not open on Sundays.

Happy Drinking!"

"event","Today is day two of me having no means of doing any work at work.  I left work Tuesday night, having kicked off a system-hogging MS Access macro.  The thing runs for 2+ hours, and uses up every ounce of my computer's courage, so I've found starting it at the end of the day avoids wasted hours during my workday.

This time, my little plan backfired.  I got into work Wednesday morning to find the classic 'Non System Disk Error' on my screen.  My previous experience with that error has been when a floppy diskette was inadvertantly left in the drive upon shutting down, and the startup function gets confused by it.  Of course, I don't even have a floppy drive on my laptop, and the CD-ROM drive was empty.

After a few Control-Alt-Delete attempts, I got a variety of errors, including one that said that a file was corrupt.  It appeared to be some aspect of my operating system, which would explain the inability of my computer to boot up.  So I used my officemate's computer to submit a 'remedy ticket' with our deskside assistance group, then took my laptop down to them.  I hooked my spare desktop PC up to my monitor/keyboard/mouse and found that it refused to let me connect to the network, having (I later learned) been removed from the domain due to inactivity.  So I hauled that down to the deskside office, too.

In the process of hauling all the stuff down, I got in trouble with the building security guards, because I was apparently supposed to use a freight elevator (which they gave me only vague directions to) to move any rolling cart in and out of the building.  Something about the tile in the entryways of the buildings getting marred.  Frankly, I was a little more concerned that I can't do any work at all, than I am about marring the tile.  But unlike the young fascist in my building, the security guy in the other building (Ralp) was helpful about showing me where to go and explaining why.

But I digress.

Today is Thursday, and I've been calling my office voicemail every 15-30 minutes since before 8am to see if deskside assistance has my laptop fixed.  So far, nothing.  At least I'm at home.  I've got my office-mates on the lookout, too, in case someone drops by.  And my (interim) boss is now on the case, trying to 'escalate' the issue and get me a loaner if nothing else.  We'll see.  Seems like getting the old desktop PC reapproved for the network would take about 15 minutes, but I'm not a tech guy, so I dunno.  As of right now, I've missed about a dozen hours of work thanks to this problem.

I have, however, remained productive.  Yesterday I finished my book (Garbage Land, by Elizabeth Royte), an d came home after lunch and installed 3 hanging shelves in our closet and turned it into a pantry for canned/boxed goods.  Today, I built a website to try to sell off our extra bookshelves (we just got a wall of 78"" shelves for our office, which now holds all our books in one place).  I'm a little frustrated that I can't just enjoy my day -- I feel like an employee of the Gap who's 'on call', unable to engage in anything that might take too much time or take me too far from the office.  Had I known I'd be unable to work the past two days, I could've gone camping or something.  Ugh.

Adding insult to injury, our home computer has a mind of it's own, and likes to turn itself off and on, disconnects itself from my DSL connection randomly, and usually locks up after a short period of inactivity.  And for some reason, I can't get my web server to authenticate so I can't upload the website I whipped up this morning.  Double Ugh."

"event","Saturday nite was GMP, Period: A Costume Time Warp -- and warped it was.  I met some great new people, and enjoyed the company of many old friends, as well.  I LOVED that someone came in a tampon costume -- and apparently it had always been a dream of his.  I did feel sorry for him when a drunk girl was demanding that he let her pour ketchup on him, and giving both he and I a disturbing run down on her experiences with dealing with her menstrual flow.  Ugh.

Not since the Paul/Kurt Xmas/Birthday Sleazy Santas party a couple years back has a GMP become so darn dirty.  A sweet guy named Bruce ended up stripping at the Nite Lite, which unfortunately got him kicked out.  I wonder if that place has cameras in that back room -- that guy was in there in no time, which seemed a little supicious.  I guess if I ran a bar with so many nooks and crannies, I'd put in some close circuit cameras too...

If you missed the party, you should definitely check out the pictures at http://www.gmpseattle.com/gallery/

Yesterday I relaxed on the couch most of the day, with intermittent periods of searching for porn on the computer.  It's for ART, dammit!  I'm doing a reading at the Bus Stop tomorrow nite, which has actually evolved into more of a performance thing (imagine that!).  I'll be taking on the persona of a college teacher, and will be reading from Desmond Morris' ""The Naked Ape"".  It's a book I snagged from my Mom years ago, which is full of overly descriptive details on human sex.  To make the reading a little more interesting, I've got a stack of 21 images, mostly very graphic porn, which will accompany the words.  It'll be like a lecture on human sexual origins, but more disturbing.  I think my favorite pictures is the guy with his dick in a fish's mouth.

If that doesn't spark your curiosity, I don't know what will... but you should come on down.  It's bound to be entertaining when Benjimen Blair, Craig Trolli, Josh Hartvigson, Jason Sharp, Eric Hildebrandt, Sarah Papineau, Dan Dembiczak, and Adrian Ryan share the same stage.

Here's the flyer I made for the reading:

In other exciting news, Steven Miller (who's been photographing me for his new series 'Dirty') got the first picture from the series on the cover of the Stranger.  No, that's not my ass.  I wish.

"event","I'm getting excited about reading next Tuesday (8/9) at The Bus Stop.  Dan's hosting one of their 'Get Lit' nights, and his theme is 'Horny Housewives - Books we stole from our Moms'.  I'm reading a book that I actually did steal from my mom:  A zoological study of humans that includes some very explicit descriptions of sex.  It's a book that I used to sneak off the shelves when I was a masturbation-obsessed, hormone-engorged, pubescent.  I hope everyone enjoys it.  I'm putting together visual aids (aka huge PORN shots), which should balance out the analytical aspects of the prose.  Oh yeah!  I also whipped up a poster/image thing for the reading:  http://www.thedans.info/horny_housewives.html

Other people reading are Craig Trolli (aka Anna Rexia), Eric Hildebrandt, Benjimen Blair (aka Sylvia O'Stayformore), Josh Hartvigson (aka Lolli Popular), Sarah Papineau, Jason Sharp, Adrian Ryan, and my boyfriend, Dan Dembiczak.  It should be a lot of fun -- even if it's on a school night.

Dan's also reading tomorrow night at the 'Seattle Spit' series at the Wildrose (http://www.thewildrosebar.com/).  I think he's reading some creepy story about a girl losing her virginity to figure out if she's a lesbian.  I got a preview, and it's good stuff.

I've spent much of tonite working on Dan's costume for GMP Period on Saturday.  He's going as Daniel Boone.  I'm going in a costume I've wanted to do for years:  Queen Elizabeth    Why we never go out in couple costumes, I don't know... Wait -- we did on Halloween last year in SF.  At least the fabric matched.  I think we just both like to think up our own concepts, and they're usually way different, but both fun."

"event","I SWEAR I was going to go to yoga this morning.  There were so many reasons... to have an excuse to see Jenny (my favorite teacher and dear friend), to try to kick start a Sunday morning habit and start to shed some of these newfound pounds, and to get back in a more relaxed, mindful head space.

Sadly, a night of party hopping left me with a splitting headache this morning, and absolutely no ability to push my face out of my pillow, let alone walk down to 8 limbs and do a few rounds of Sun Salutations.

The parties, thankfully, were a blast.  We started the evening down at the Bus Stop to celebrate Josh H's birthday.  He was once again out as his latest alter ego, Lolli Popular -- a girl who was grounded by her strict mother and forced to live in the basement with no contact with the outside world, except for the occasional chaperoned trip to a swap meet.  It was at one of those swap meets that Lolli convinced her overbearing and cruel mother to buy her an auto harp... the same auto harp Lolli later used to bludgeon her mother to death and break free of her basement prison.  Needless to say, after so many years trapped in a basement, Lolli's a little out of touch with Popular culture, but has an innocent air about her, and a very creative side.  She's mastered that killer auto harp, and can do wonders with her hair.  Last night, she wove and wired it into a giant birdcage to show off her collection of stuffed birds.  But of all her stunning features, it's Lolli's tattoos that I covet the most.  Beautiful butterflies on one forearm and a tiger on the other.  The naivete of Lolli combined with the hard-edge of her sleeve tattoos is a wonder to behold

Also out in force were Em'ma Gawd, Anna Rexia, and Tina Tourniquet -- and the four of them definitely lit up the Bus Stop.  With the Block Party going on this weekend, every bar on Capitol Hill was invaded by total wankers from, I assume, the suburbs.  The appearance of Lolli and the girls actually drove out a number of the bar's clientele, though I doubt the staff minded.  Anyone who's not down with the drag queens might as well take their business elsewhere.

Also making a guest appearance at the Bus Stop was my pal Curtis.  Despite working together and shooting the shit there every weekday, we never run out of stuff to talk about.  His musical knowledge alone is enough to fill a library.  We ended up cracking each other up over favorite Reno 911/The State skits, as it turns out he's a big fan as well.  As an aside, I think the folks on Reno 911 are possibly the funniest people alive.  Every episode has me laughing out loud at my television.  What did I do without it?

After the Bus Stop, Dan & I waded through the crowds of yahoos to make it up to Martin's Off Madison -- the former Full Circle Bar & Grill, which was the former Sea Wolf.  As far as I'm concerned (and as far as many people are concerned) it will forever be the Sea Wolf.  Everyone knows where the Sea Wolf is, but no one's heard of it's latest two incarnations.

The reason for our trek to bar that changes it's name more often than Prince?  My ex boyfriend and good friend Paul is leaving Seattle to return to Wichita, Kansas.  It sounds horrible, but he has good reasons:  Being closer to a mother who's recovering from breast cancer, and returning to school for his Masters degree (all expenses paid, I understand).

Paul's going away party was a hoot -- with so many faces I hadn't seen in years.  Paul's ex Guy was there with his longterm boyfriend Joe.  My old neighbor Tom and my old roommate Frank both popped in.  Andrew, Bill, Michael, Robbie... so many old friends that I haven't seen in forever.  It was great to get to catch up a bit, see how everyone's doing, and reconnect a bit.  Guy & I, acting as the former boyfriends, also made Paul request a show of hands from all the boys he's slept with while in town.  That made for some big laughs as a large number of people raised their hands -- including people doing it just for the laughs.  They also auctioned off Paul's underwear and shirt, a date with him, and a free DJ set from Alvin (which I was hoping for).  Thankfully, the DJ set went to Nathan, who'll be taking advantage of it for his housewarming party -- hopefully coming soon.  I got the chance to dance to Alvin's tunes at Benjimen's Bday soire, as well as Paul's going away party.  Besides being a REALLY nice guy, he spins a mean set of 80's hits that keeps my feet moving.  Last night, in fact, it was hard to pull me away.

So that's why I didn't make it to yoga this morning.  At least I got some exercise dancing last night, right?"

Without revealing too much, it's based on some of Burroughs writing about drawing sexual energy out of violence, and my role was that of a bystander (cooking a hot dog while in underpants).  The man's a genius.  My boyfriend got to be a part of it, too.  It made for a long day (cooked breakfast in the am for us and a friend, taught her to solder EL-wire, went to a going away BBQ in Northgate, then drove to Tukwila for the photo shoot), but I think it was well worth it.

"event","I recently watched an MTV 'reality' program called 'MADE', and have been meaning to rant about it ever since.  So here goes...

The premise of the show is to turn someone into something that they 'want' to be, that's much different than what they are.  It's somewhere between a makeover and a sex change operation, I guess.  I've seen commercials for episodes where a girl with a reputation as a 'ditzy blond' is MADE into a snowboarder, and where a high school jock is MADE into a ballerina.  The episode I watched was a little different.  As far as I can tell, they MADE a nice tomboy into a thoughtless BITCH.

The girl in question was Sam.  And, well, she's the girl in high school that probably grew up to be a dyke.  Plays sports, wears t-shirts and basketball shorts every day, doesn't shower every day, wears her hair pulled back into a ponytail, no make-up, belches... you get the idea.  She also seemed like a very cool girl -- she ate lunch with her younger brother, for instance.  But her mom seemed troubled by the fact that she didn't want to wear dresses and make-up, and from what I could tell from the show, it was her mom's pressure (and crying) that drove Sam to agree to be MADE.  

Maybe it's true that Sam was tired of not having a lot of close girl friends.  Maybe she wanted to be more attractive to the guys at school.  Maybe she needed a little confidence boost.  But maybe, just maybe, she's actually tired of not having girlfriends, wants to be attractive to the girls on her team, and THAT would give her the confidence boost.

I'm not usually one to assume someone's sexuality, and GOD KNOWS I love to play dress up, but I got the distinct feeling that this was not something that Sam initially wanted for herself, and that it was more something she was willing to endure to make her mom stop crying.

The good folks at MTV hired a ex-beauty queen to be Sam's MADE coach.  She made her wear girl clothes and high heels, she taught her to put on makeup, and she got her a makeover.  They even picked out prom dresses together.  That's all well and good.  But she also taught Sam how to ignore the feelings of people.

As part of the process, Sam 'needed' to learn to talk to guys she was attracted to in a 'girly-girl' way -- aka not belching but flirting.  She employed the help of a friend on her team to teach her the ropes.  In the process, she met a guy on the hockey team named Eric.  Eric eventually asked her to prom, giving her a big bouquet of roses.  Seems perfect, right?

Apparently not based on the standards of Sam's new popular friends.  They convinced her to set her sights 'higher', on another Eric who was on the baseball team.  A few 'do you think Sam's cute' phone calls later, and Sam was ready to dump hockey Eric and go to prom with baseball Eric.  Problem was, baseball Eric hadn't asked her.  At the coaching of her beauty-queen 'coach', Sam kept hockey Eric as a backup date, while working on getting baseball Eric to take her to prom.  She starts hanging out with a crowd of 'popular' girls, stops hanging out with her brother (even standing him up), and starts going to baseball games to cheer for baseball Eric.  The jaded former geek in me can't help but think the 'popular' kids start hanging out with Sam (a girl they used to be grossed out by) because it would get them on MTV.  But I digress...

TWO FUCKING DAYS BEFORE PROM, Sam asked baseball Eric to go to prom at a game.  He did the honorable thing and said 'No, I couldn't do that to (hockey) Eric'.  Sam claimed that hockey Eric wouldn't mind, he agreed to take her, and it was a done deal.  Sam had officially 'traded up' from hockey Eric to baseball Eric.  But she still hadn't told hockey Eric.  TWO FUCKING DAYS BEFORE PROM, after hockey Eric had undoubtedly made dinner plans, rented a tux, ordered a corsage, etc., Sam called him on the phone and dumped him.  She said, 'I'm not going to prom.  Or actually, I'm not going to prom with you.'  Later, again at the coaching of the beauty queen, she wrote him a letter to explain herself and left it on his doorstep.  She never even talked to him about it face to face, and MTV chose to turn their focus away from her DUMPING ALL OVER hockey Eric, and to the great excitement of her prom night.  Never mind that hockey Eric probably already shelled out big $$ to make it a great prom for her.

So to recap, Sam dumps on her brother and former friends to hang out with popular girls, and trails along a guy as a backup prom date until she was able to get a popular guy to go with her.  It's like 'Can't buy me love', 'Mean Girls', 'Clueless', and SO many other teen films personified, except without the moralistic ending.  It's like the end of 'Pretty in Pink' when Andie (Molly Ringwald) goes to prom with Ducky (Jon Cryer), then leaves him for Blane (Andrew McCarthy).  I HATE the end of that movie.

Perhaps for an upcoming episode, MTV could do some conversion therapy on a young gay man to make him straight so his dad won't kick him out of the house, or bleach the skin of a black woman so she'll fit in with her white husband's family.  Sick.

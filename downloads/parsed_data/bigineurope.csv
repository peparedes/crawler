"event","Yeah, so I'm still getting over a cold, which is turing either into a cough or another sore throat.  I have a bad feeling It's gonna be a cough.  My roommate is gonna kill me by the end of this week.  Its raining here which is not a big suprise, after all, it is seattle.  But my sun lamp is keeping me cheery and Amanda is comming up for a weekend so I'm really happy about that.  It will give me a chance to actually explore the city and not be cooped up at my schol like I have been since I got here.  Its not that I'm depress or anything, I just haven't gotten the courage to explore on my own.  Blaise, my roommate is really cool.  We get a long just fine.  My new Dell DJ is my new child.  I take it everywhere I go and it keeps me company on my walks to capitol hill (think of santa monica blvd. mixed with Old Town Pasadena) for a burger at Dick's (An In and Out wannabe but doesn't compare. Can Anyone say Animal Style fries?)  Ok....no more procrastinating!!!!!!!!!!!  I have to do work."

"event","Goodbye sun, good bye warmth!!!  Hello, gloom, rain, and cold!!!!  The last day of sun was two days ago and I was hoping for it to be that way the whole time.  But after all this is Seattle, the city where at UW, RA's have to lock the balcony doors at certain itmes of the year so stressed and depressed kids won't jump to end thier life.  Thankfully, I'm on the other side of town at SU which is brightly painted and has a very warm atmosphere.  No locked balconies here, no seriee.  Everyone is really nice and my classes are great.  In my Epxeriencing Music class, there are doing a section on African Music and certain days, all we do is African Drumming!!!!  Its really fun and every sings and dances and......well drum!  My College Writing class went to play Laser tag.  I think our professor told us it had to do with our class theme (Violence in American Society) but, we all knew that she just wanted to us to have fun.  I got the top score in both games!!!!  That class is also gonna go to the gun range soon.  It's gonna be the first time I've shot a real gun.  I have to admit, I am getting homesick and the weather doesn't help one bit.  Please call, anyone!!!!!

Anyway, just in Econ class doing nothing once again and I was bored.  I've decided that certain people just need to be hit just because of who they are.  For thoes of you who know me, I am a very passive person and would never hit someone unless they deserved it.  Adam L., Adam G. Tal T. Lauren B. to name a few need to be hit hard in the arm or at least slapped in the face for about 10 mins.  I NEED A BREAK FROM ALL THIS BUSYWORK CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I can't wait for friday to come around for two reasons (SHHHHHHHHHHHHH ;))  A word of advice, do not go see the ring two, it is uneventful and not really scary.    And now for something completely different



A boy went to a fortune teller and the fortune teller told him that his father will die in two days.  The boy runs home to tell his mother.  ""mom mom, dad going to die in two days you gotta warn him mom! help him""  The mom just looks at his son and says "" Son, that fortune teller is just scaring you, you dad is not going to die""  
""But mom he is, he is!!!!!!!""  
""No he is not""

The boy gives up and runs to his dad
""Dad! Dad! you have to do something! a fortune teller told me you were going to die intwo days""  
""Son, you know that the fortune teller is just scaring you.  I'm not going to die anytime soon""
""But dad, I'm scared, I don't want you to die""
""Son I won't""

But the boy was still scared but there was nothing he could do.
SO two days later he wakes up very nervous.  The boy runs into in the kitchen to find both his parents alive and well.  The boy over heard his mom talking about him
""I knew it was just some stupid fortune teller.  He was just scared"" The boy let out a breath.""But the strange thing is the mailman dropped dead today, very strange"""

AND IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  7 hours of continuous music by bands that I all love very much (except for Chevelle)  The performance list went like this:
1. My chemical Romance
2. The Used
3. Chevelle
4. Good Charlotte
5. Papa ""motherfucking"" Roach
6. Sum 41
7. Social Distortion
8. Incubus (with the police FUCKING AWESOME!)
9. Velvet Revolver
10. Green Day

Everyone was awesome, but the highlights were Papa Roach and their amazing satanic laughing frenzy, Sum 41 and their elvis skit, Incubus and their jam session with two members of the Police, Velevet Revolver and their godlike reputation to put on a kick ass rock and roll show the world will never see repeated by any other band, and of course Green Day because their are green day and green day is fucking awesome.  (if you;ve been to a green day show you know what I mean.  If you haven't go see them live, It will be the most fun you will ever have besides going to a flogging Molly show OLAY!)  the pit was awesome and the atmosphere was great!

A teacher of mine is planning a field trip to Disneyland (As all of you know, DL is my Mecca) but to go on the trip, we needed to turn in any late assignments we had.  During that day he told each person what they needed to turn it to qualify to go.  we gave us a week to get the assingments turned in.  Well, I did, but he did not call me up to get the information to go to the happiest place on earth.  It turns out HE didn't give me 4 of the assignment I needed to do. So I ot the other 4 and turned them the next day which is today.  Well, eventhough I turned in all hte assignments we denied me to go.  I started to argue saying I did everyting he asked me to do.  I told him the situation was crap and he told me the conversation was over.  So I walked out and I said to myself as I walked out ""This is Bullshit"".  He came in yelling at me for being disrespectful to him, I told him ""I thought we finished the coversation?""

"event","Haven't you ever noticed that the Valley is divided into two parts.  I've realized that when ever i go over to the west valley (Woodland hills, northridge, chatsworth, granda hills, thousand oaks, agoura hills, calabasas) I get a weird feelings. It like the valley is separated and the 405 is like it's axis.  Every time I get introuble it seems to always be west of the 405.  The thing is also, both the mind set of the people on the west side of the 405 seem to be opposite of the people on the east side (burbank, sherman oaks, studio city, glendale, Van Nuys 'sorta', universal city). If aynone has anything offer to this theory of the two opposing side of the valley please let me know."

"event","I just love drama!!!!!!!!!  It's like a drug: It not healthy but you still want more of it.  I just hate to see drama end.  You don't want it to end.  The fights, the bitching, the endless use of profanity, the mindlessness of every action made.  Even the reason why the drama started is almost always stupid and the people who have the urge to start something should be hit with a frying pan. (especialy thoes who somewho think they are better than everyone else because they are older, or happen to be in a higher grade in school.  To everyone who has started any shit or adds to the shittiness: do us all a favor, Do something about it or SHUT UP!"

I realized the reason why I got into writing music was because I could do it on my own time, at my own pace, and I would only have to answer to me.  I don't think I would want to persue a career in music just because I like to do it on my own."

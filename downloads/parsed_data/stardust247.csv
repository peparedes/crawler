"event","I got home last night.  It's weird.  

It's not being home that's weird - it's my life that's weird.  It was so hard to say goodbye to everyone and to that chapter of my life.  The end.  But I can't think of it that way or I will get to sad.  I will go back to the UK and Europe many more times in my life and I will see my friends again and keep in contact with them. I'll just enjoy what I have while I have it and go from there.

I'm so excited to upload all my pictures!  And let me tell you there are a LOT.

But right now I'm going to enjoy my family and friends and 4th of July and highly recommend that you do the same.

Mmwah!

"event","So I think I've lost all the pictures that I haven't uploaded onto here.  Crappy huh?  I had all of these cute pics and videos of the kids and stuff and they are gone.  

And so I am computer-less and picture-less.  They say the new computer is coming ""this week"" and not to be Miss Negative but based on previous experiences that means within the next 3 months.  

The other crappy thing is that my camera is full and I have no computer. :-P  

Man, my life is so hard. (insert heavy sarcasm)

Things are great minus the rain and cold.  Erin is cuter and funnier everyday.  Sean is a gem - I hope my kids are half as good as he is.  And Tara .. well she's a doll but definitely the middle child.

And in other more happy current events, I bought some divine smelling hand soap and an air freshener that smells like all things good in the world. 

What else?  Oh I rented Crash last week.  It was amazing.  I can't say anything that would do it justice so just go see it if you haven't."

"event","I usually take Erin to a play group on Tues mornings because it's nice for her to get out and see other kids and I can visit with Alyson and Darcell (two friends from Church).  Alyson has a little girl named Hazel and she's a few months older than Erin but she's very sweet so we keep trying to get them to be friends.  Although how you get a 2 year old and a 1 1/2 year old to be friends is beyond me.  I don't think they really get the concept of ""friends"" yet.

But today when we were walking out the door Hazel took Erin's hand and said ""hold your hand"".  So they walked out to the car holding eachother's hands (and our hands to keep from falling over) and it was just so sweet.  She has lots of cousins and stuff but they're older and usually just want her out of the way.  And then when we got to our car they kept looking back at eachother and saying ""bye"".  

I know this is kind of a silly thing to write in my journal about but I love Erin and it was really sweet to see her bond or whatever to someone as a friend."

Ireland was amazing.  Freezing but great.  And yes, I did go to the beach and it was so fun.  Well as fun as it can be while buddled up and with a toddler.  We went on Christmas Day and Erin had a blast picking up shells and watching the dogs running on the beach.

We stayed with David's family and so I got to meet all his brothers and sisters.  I'd already met his mom and dad and one brother.  I thought it would be weird staying with them but they were so nice and welcoming and I had a great time.  We also went to visit a lot of Mary's family and they were just as great.  On Christmas we went over to her parents in the evening and I got to meet the rest of her brothers and sisters and all their kids and we had a big quiz game.  I have to say that I was able to contribute to our team coming in at a good solid second place.  And Mary's parents are so nice and cute.  They are exactly what you'd think and older Irish couple would be like - they even wore green, though that might have had more to do with it being Christmas.

I took the train into Dublin on Christmas Eve and got to look around.  I went to Grafton Street, which is a big shopping area.  There's a big spire in the middle of town  (which helped me find my way) and I found out that everyone calls it the stiletto in the ghetto.  Hahaha.  It's kind of true though.

It was a really nice Christmas and I spent a lot of time playing Monopoly with Sean and playing shop with Tara.  And Erin and I seemed to bond even more.  There were 3 or 4 times when Mary was holding her and she wanted to come to me.  That was a big improvement.  And just the other day she started saying my name.  Well it's more like Ness but it's so cute.  

That's all I can think of. I'm sure I'll think of more when I get the pictures up."

I <B>promise</b> to take lots and lots of pictures while I'm there.

I had told Tara I'd paint her finger and toe nails before she left so that's what I spent a good portion of the evening doing.  I have little nail jewels that I put on her and I have to say that her toe nails are pretty bling- bling for a 5 year old.  I'll put pics up tomorrow for those of you who are dying to see.

As for Christmas cards - I was full of good intentions but never quite got around to it so if you get one in late Jan ... well I like to keep the Christmas spirit going as long as I can.  Or at least that's my excuse for being a slacker."

"event","This weekend was funny... and not really the ""ha ha funny"" kind of funny.

On Thursday I tried on a really nice jumper at the Gap but decided to think about it instead of blowing my money right then. By that night I decided that I loved it and I'd go buy in on Sat morning. I was so excited about it! So I set my alarm to go off early to go to the mall. I wanted to get there early only because parking is a NIGHTMARE on a Saturday. So off I go and the Gap is closed and there's a guy out there who tells me it'll be open in an hour. Weird. So I go buy a CD and walk around ... blah blah. I come back and the gate is still closed to I continue to window shop. I go back again and now there's a sign out in front saying that the store will be ""closed until further notice"" and to call some number after 1pm if you have other questions. I was so sad. I went to ask the guy if he thought they'd be open at all that day and he said he didn't think so. Ugh. So I told him, ""But this is the whole reason I got up this morning."" He kind of looked at me and grunted and went back inside. 

Lesson learned: Never make a special trip to do anything because if you have my luck it won't work out.

Late that day I drove to the tube station to go and meet Marielle. Since I had to change trains at Bond street I thought I'd go into the Gap there and look. (Yeah I was a little obsessed at this point) So of course they don't have my size left but I did get a pair of cute green gloves. Yay.

I met Marielle and we went to dinner at a place claiming to have ""Real American Food"". The French's Classic Yellow musturd was about the only thing that was American but it was fun. Then we went to see Harry Potter. Afterwards Marielle took me to the tube station so I could take the last train home. 

At this point it's around midnight and I got the last train. I had to change at Bond Street again and was praying the whole way that I would get there in time. I didn't. And because the station was closing all had to exit the station. By now it's almost 1am and I'm standing on Oxford Street all alone. You have to understand that I don't live close to the West End at all. It takes about 30 by tube. And I couldn't get back to Marielle's house because the station was now closed. So I went to a bus stop and asked the next bus that stopped if there were any busses to Ruislip (where my car was). He said no but that I could go to Uxbridge on the N207. Uxbridge is a lot closer to my house than Uxbridge but my car wasn't there. I didn't really have a choice though so I got on the bus and away I went. 

The bus was PACKED. Both the upper and lower levels were completely full and people were sitting in the luggage racks. But at least I wasn't alone right? I finally got a seat and another woman sat next to me. She was as drunk as you can get and still be conscious. So the whole time she's leaning against me and explaining to these men how she'd been in a fight with a woman from Ethiopia. I was just about to get up because I didn't really enjoy her leaning on me when she puked all over herself and me. It was all down my leg and I got up and moved. 

It was a LONG bus ride. A good two hours. About a 1/2 hour before we got into Uxbridge a group of guys at the back of the bus started cheering every few minutes. I looked back to see what was going on and saw that he had vomited all over the floor. Apparently that was what had caused all the cheering. So now all the guys are singing and cheering as this guy continued to puke and then decided to make a game of asking what he'd had for dinner. I think the final verdict was chicken korma. 

So I made it off the bus in Uxbridge. I didn't feel like it was safe to walk since it would have taken me a good 45 minutes and so I started asking other people if they knew the number of a mini cab service. No one did so I started walking. Afer a little while I saw a phone box and went in and there was the number of a cab service so I called and got a ride. Thank goodness. It was expensive but by then I just wanted to go home. And I made it in one piece!

Lesson learned: Never plan on taking the tube after midnight!

So the next morning I had to tell Mary I'd left her car in Ruislip (pronounced Rice Lip) and I was afraid she's be upset. Fortunately she was very sympathetic! And I had a friend take me after church to get it and that was the end of the adventure for me.

I told myself I'm never going anywhere again but that's probably not true."

"event","What did you do (so far) in 2005 that you'd never done before?
Lived on someone's couch for a month.

Did you keep your New Years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year? 
I don't think I made any last year but I will try to this year.

Did anyone close to you give birth?
YES.

Did anyone close to you die? 
No.

What countries did you visit? 
The U.K.!

What would you like to have in 2006 that you lacked in 2005?
My money - saving skills can always use improvement and a car that runs when I get back to the States.

What date from 2005 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?
June 1st - the day I moved out of hell

What was your biggest achievement of the year? 
Moving out of my apt.

What was your biggest failure?
Staying in that apt for a year and letting people walk all over me.

Where did most of your money go?
Ugh... I don't know.  Crap probably.

What did you get really, really, really excited about?
Moving to Orem and seeing Chels after 2.4 YEARS!  No one should not see their best friend for that long.

"event","So it's been a month since I've written anything.  

I've been sick - on and off but mostly on.  The last few days haven't been so bad so that means I'm either getting better or just getting used to it.

I went to a Pampered Chef party last night at Alyson's house.  It was funny because it was all Americans except the woman selling it and 2 other ladies.  She kept saying that we were making her nervous because a lot of us already knew about Pampered Chef.  It was mostly ladies from church and it was fun to hang out with them and meet a few new people.

The only bad thing was that I kept coughing and it got worse as the evening went on.  Alyson's husband kept asking me if I wanted cough drops and bringing me water.  It was pretty embarrassing.  They said they are going to start calling me Typhoid Mary.  ha ha ha

Not much else is going on.  I canNOT believe it's December allready!"

I feel like crap. I kicked the sinus infection por fin and now this. I can barely swollow and my glads feel like they are about to burst. So I feel like poop.

Natalia spent the night last night because she's freaked out about staying in her house alone. She's an aupair too and her family is on holiday in Ireland as well. It was fun to have company. We made spagetti and garlic bread and watched way too much TV.

This morning I cleaned and ironed and all that. The best part of the morning was getting a card from Chelsea in the mail... or should I say ""in the post""? :-P Totally made my day."

It's funny though... the house is never <i>this</i> quiet.  It's kind of creepy.

"event","I decided to give my journal a new look.  Maybe now that it's pretty I'll be more inclined to write/ post pictures.  We'll see.

Last night was awful.  I had the worst migrane I've ever had.  I was babysitting because Mary & David had made plans and that was fine but Tara was sick so I didn't want to go to bed because I knew if she woke up and couldn't find me all heck would break lose.  She never does wake up in the middle of the night but I know my luck.  My sinuses were <i>killing</i> me.  Literally.  I turned all the lights off and sat on the couch with my eyes closed listening to the tv.  It was ridiculous.  They got home at around one and I've never been so happy to see my bed.  I can't even describe the pain - it was awful.

So this morning I took a trip to Boots - just a pharmacy - in search of some serious sinus medicine.  I have to say as much as people drive me crazy here sometimes, the pharmacists (sp?) here are wonderful.  They were so helpful.  I came home and took my medicine and feel 842% better.  Thank heavens!

Tonight David's dad is coming over for a chinese dinner.  He comes over every Saturday night and he's a hoot.  He has all of these crazy ideas and boy, can he talk! But he's the nicest person in the world. I  enjoy eating with them because there's not many other times where I can just talk to them without the kids.

I bought part of my halloween costume today too!  I don't care if I'm sitting at home with a 1 year old all day.  I'm dressing up!"

She never replied so now I'm all paranoid that she thought that I didn't know when her birthday was. As if! There are some things you just don't forget. I don't anyway. So I called her this morning at work at around 2 or 3am (cali time) and left her a birthday message. 

Too bad I sound like a man. I've been sick all week and I'm going crazy. I have a tickle in my throught that makes me cough like typhoid Mary and a sinus infection. Hurray! Watching kids as not been the funnest - especially since they're sick too. I've decided I'm too selfish to have children. I like sleeping and not picking up the same mess 957 times in one day. I've been told it's better when they are your own. We'll see.

I went to a birthday party on Friday night.  It was fun. I didn't know hardly anyone but it was a good laugh.  There was a ton of food and a karaoke machine and lots of drinks.  Sometimes I get sick of explaining to people that I don't drink.  Whatever.  

We all stayed the night at Karen's house and Natalia and I shared a room.  I think I slept on the most uncomfortable bed known to man.  I'm not sure why a bed like this was ever built but it could not have been for sleeping purposes.  We stayed up till about 3:30am and Karen woke us up about 7:30 for breakfast.  That was just cruel. But they were going paint-balling that day and had to leave early. Natalia and I weren't going so after they left we went back to bed for an hour then came to my house to change.  

We changed and then hopped on the tube to Oxford Street to buy some boots for Natalia.  The day before we'd driven to Windsor to look at these boots but they had some defects...anyway I've heard about nothing else but these boots for 2 weeks so I was excited she was going to buy them.

<A HREF=""http://www.hobbs.co.uk/collection/shoes_boots/sb1b.htm""><b>  You've got to see these boots! </b> </a>

Too make a long story short we ended going to two other stores before buying them in Sloane Square.  They were very happy to come home with us.

I love London.  We wandered through Gucci and Chanel and Louis Vuitton and Tiffany's on our way back.  Bliss.

I admit it... I'd never been in Tiffany's before.  But I can happily say that I know what Holly Golightly meant when she said, ""The quietness and the proud look of it; nothing very bad could happen to you there. If I could find a real-life place that'd make me feel like Tiffany's, then - then I'd buy some furniture and give the cat a name!""

Anyway... it was fun."

Marielle was kind enough to go to the swim meet with me.  It was 2 hours of sitting in the pool area (which was SOOOOO hot and sweaty).  I can't say that the swimming was all that exciting but Ayo was fantastic of course.  It was worth it to see them.

"event","And boy am I tired.  It was such a great weekend though - it was worth the driving and horrible traffic.

I left here on Friday at about 12:30 and headed into London.  Of course it never occured to me to bring a map or to think that here might be an easier way than drive staight through the center of London...  It was fun driving through London though.  I just kept looking for areas that sounded familiar and avoiding the congestion charge areas.  After forever I found the Blackwall Tunnell which I remembered leads right into Greenwich where I was meeting everyone.  The traffic was horrible since it was the last bank holiday of the summer.  I got into Greenwich at around 2 and since I wasn't suppposed to meet them till 3pm I decided to drive through Woolwich and into Thamesmead (where I lived before).  It was so fun to see it after so long.  I drove by Femi and Gbenga's (even though I new that they weren't home) and then headed back to Marielle's.

From London to Manchester.  

Of course since we were supposed to leave at 3pm we didn't leave until almost 5pm.  Even the best laid plans...  So it was me, Marielle, Pei Fen, Jen and Michael.  Jen had just flown in from Canada and that's why we planed to leave at 3 - otherwise we would have left much, much earlier.  But it was fun.  We took a couple wrong turns on the motorway but other than that there were no problems.  And since we left so late we missed most of the traffic.  

We got into Manchester around 10:30pm and realized the ''under carriage'' of the bumper was dragging.  The perfect end to a long trip.  But we managed to reattach it and get checked in.  We were staying at Fallow Fields on the University of Manchester campus in the dorms.

Of course they couldn't find my registration and there was an incident with a lady named Carol - but in the end it got cleared up.  Thank goodness.  That night we were supposed to sign up for our activites and then there was a dance upstairs.

The theme of the Conference was ""Boldy, Nobly and Independant"" (from the Standard of Truth written by Joseph Smith.  So for the Opening Ceremony there was a presentation on his life and all of the amazing things he did.  And then there was a performance by 2 girls and 1 guy dressed as super heros... and it was very, VERY entertaining.  They were very brave.  But it was funny.

Saturday we got up for breakfast and met some other people from the Catford Ward.

After that I went to the cantata rehersal.  The cantata itself was on Sunday night and it was amazing how well it went with only 2 rehersals.  So many people brought their musical instruments so it was cool.  One girl brought her harp that was taller than me!  We performed My Servant Joseph by Kenneth Cope. <img src=""http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b372/gratefulbean/My_Servant_Jospeh.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">  Here is a link that has an <A HREF=""http://www.kennethcope.com/wdk/showNews.phtml?newsID=158"">interview</a> w/ Kenneth Cope about the music he'd written for this piece.  It's pretty cool.

We skipped some of the activities on Saturday because we wanted to go into Manchester and look around.  It's a really gorgeous city but boy were we in for a surprise!



Yep, that's right, it was the Manchester Gay Pride parade and it was huge!  (I hope that picture doesn't offend anyone - it was just a shock to go from a nice LDS church activity to that.) 

We only stayed for a few mintues and didnt' get to see much else because of the streets being blocked off and the thousands and thousands of people there.

There were sooooooooooooooooo many people there!

I turned around and <b>YIKES!</b>

They were dancing to Gwen Stefani's ""The S*** is Bananas""...  funny.

That was enough for us... we hurried back to the Conference.  When we got back we went to a salsa class.  It was actually a lot of fun.  They're giving salsa classes here in Hillingdon so maybe I'll sign up!  Okay I probably won't but it was fun.

Saturday night there was another dance.  Some people were way dressed up and others weren't... I didn't feel like spending money on a fancy dress for one night -especially with such little notice.

Our group: Viliana, Jen, Pei Fen, Lucy, Emma, Me, and Marielle.  The guys were hiding.

But it was fun - it kind of felt like prom though.  There was a professional photographer there but the queue was so long that we didn't bother.  They had chocolate fountains all over the room and a live band playing swing music (or jive as they call it here).  Oh they also had Dodge 'ems set up outside (aka Bumper Cars).  That was also fun.  I'm bummed I didn't get any pictures of that though.

Sunday we had a huge sacrament meeting.  There were almost 1,000 people at the convention.  
<img src=""http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b372/gratefulbean/DSCN0195.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
It was definitely cool to see the sacrament being passed to that many people. President Lund, the Area Authority President and his wife, and Elder Ford of the Area Authority Presidency and his wife came to speak to us and it was really, really cool.  They just gave such great messages but  were also so fun and funny.

After church we had our dress rehersal for the cantata.  I convinced Jen to come with me since Marielle and Pei Fen had disappeared.  We rehersed for close to 4 hours so I think Jen wanted to kill me but I loved it.  After that we ran to dinner because we were starving!

The cantata went so well!  It was a miracle.  Everyone loved it and it was worth the long rehersals.  

After that we went back to Marielle's room to hang out for awhile.

After that we went outside and everyone was sitting around playing games, talking and just having fun.  So we joined them and met some cool people.  We didn't go to bed till 3:30am though!  I didn't realize it was so late - especially since I'd be driving home the next day.  But it was fun.

The next morning I got up for breakfast and the devotional and immediately went back to bed till noon.  I don't think I've ever slept so well!  After the closing ceremony they gave us sack lunches and told us to go home.

It was about 3pm by the time we left and we got into London around 8:30.  I dropped Michael off at his house, took Pei Fen home, got Jen's luggage and took her to the train station, took Marielle home, and I got home at midnight.  Whew!

It was crazy but so much fun!

I'm excited though! *waves*"

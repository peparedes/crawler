But i was reading Amy's LJ and i would have to agree with amy that ""When you finally let your guard down things go wrong."" Isnt that the truth i think thats one of my problems i FINALLY let myself be told things and i believe them, ALL of them then out of know where *PUFF* Shot right in the Heart...once again!! lol Oh so lame of me! ahhh!! freakin' vagina man! The only thing i got going for me now is ""mY amazing friends"" and working out everyday of my life. ha jk jk. Things are actully going pretty good right now i guess...i shouldnt be bitching about it at all. I have a feeling this week will be ok..Hopefully it will be better then the last couple of weeks they were pretty crappy. So last night was pretty scary when i was falling asleep well I couldnt actually fall sleep because wow i dont think i even wanna say it. It was just
really scary I kept waking Kim's ass up and telling her to stay awake with me. weird i had to put on some music so i could block out what i was thinking. im never watching scary movies without a guy or before I go to sleep. My best friend passed out when i was still watching the movie All by myself!! not kool kim! Its ok because I got to drive Kim's mexican jeep when we went to rent movies it was amazing!!!We got stuck at a green light and people were beeping at us and i flicked them off (i have really bad
road rage) and I tried to straighten out the wheel yeah it def. didnt work we almost flew off the road. :) good times. well V-day is tuesday....Im so excited me and jamie are so hanging out and having an anti- V-day which should be pretty rad. 

ahhh SB in like 2months! ill be at my house in the keys with my best friend drinkin everyday behind my house on the beach! :)

 i've been pushing someone away lately Because i'm not sure who they are anymore. I hear so many things and that person tells me things too. i'm not sure who to believe anymore Maybe i've been listening to the same thing over and over again that i'm so use to all the lies. But are they lies? I dont know anymore. I dont want this to be a big deal. But it hurts because i've been there for that person as long as i could remember and they cant even tell me the truth. Its just not that anymore its how now i see them so different then i did before. I feel bad for being this way and not paying attention to that person. But if i said anything about it ::rolling eyes:: it wouldnt be pretty, it will end up being me overactting about it and that person always making it a joke. Theres know use in trying. Thats why i always give up everytime we would argue and let them win. Which that isnt me at all!! 

a week from today is tori's birthday!

i've been inspired...no jk i wish i'm so artisticly frustrated right now. lol I stopped two drawings that i started a week ago. I'm bored with it. I've decided that i need to go somewhere and take pictures and see what i end up with.

<P>well i havent written in a few days just b/c well i havent felt like expressing my thoughts. psh. whatever. no but things are going good i suppose. Its just been a little rough at my house.&nbsp;Geez i kinda wish that i wasnt so stuborn and selfish&nbsp;at times. I&nbsp;dont mean too, i dont mean to not care. I never realized how much i can hurt and disappoint someone so much. But he doesnt understand how much i hurt when he says the things he says to me. It hurts me when someone tells me that i'm not the way they want me to be. The way i should look,&nbsp;act, be someone that i'm not and i've told god that ""i'm sorry"" that i'm not.&nbsp;&nbsp;What&nbsp; does&nbsp; everyone&nbsp; want&nbsp; from&nbsp; me? if i could make everyone happy i would. Ya, sometimes i know i'm just so stubborn and i want everything my way and i do know that doesnt get me anywhere. And i'am trying to change but i'm gonna change not for them for me the person i should be. I dont wanna let anyone down but&nbsp;just let me be me. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well starting 2morrow its going to be one crazy Summer. o joy then i have to get a job chris wants me to be a lifeguard. whatever. idk yet. </P>

My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know.
And what meant the world had folded 
like legs and fingers holding onto what escapes me; 
what he has: a better kiss that never lasts.

You said, between your smiles and regrets: ""Don't say it's over.""
Dead and gone.

The calm before the storm set it off, and the sun burnt out tonight.
A reception less than warm set it off. The sun burnt out tonight.

This is me standing in the arch of the door hating 
that look that's on your face that says 
there's another fool like me.
There's one born every minute.

"event","so its about 1:10 in the morning. Me and gaby just got done doing my circuit board project and i layed on my floor and looked at pictures from prom and realized that i have to wake  up at 5:30 and meet lauren at school @ 6:15 so we can drop these retarded projects in class and go get some food or starbucks. o joy. right. ya i dont know why i'm still sitting here typing while my foot is going numb. Ya'll guess what we will be seniors in 7 days. ahh! o crap! And were FREE for 2months? lol I need a job, i cant be a BUM this summer not that i'll ever be home but still. So coming up this next month like 3 concerts, my birfday, road trip, six flags, Going to the lake. YAY! i'm so excited. 

i hate it when i get emotionally attached...

I was thinking that during spring break my mom was telling me how i'm not very loving anymore. That i dont like to hug and be loving. And thats kinda weird cuz i'm like that around my step mom i jump on her on the couch and sit/lay her. I think i do that b/c i dont get attention from my step mom she kinda pushes me away sometimes and that kinda hurts cuz theres no1 else who just wants to hug me and hold me. my dad is never home to just hug me and slap me around lol But o well poor cristine lets all feel sorry for her like my step mom says. psh. ya right. Thats the last thing i need is for anyone to feel sorry for me.

so i'm still sitting here...listening to rock and thinking/typing way to much. 

ooooo i want to hate u half as much as i hate myself...-Fall out boy

sooo...
Ya i was thinking its time to give up an old habbit that really isnt the best one that i could have. Condisering my families past history too(right lauren)But i can still be a PArty Girl, Cant i? I was thinking This morning on the way home from laurens and the talks we had last night while feeling like shyt. I'm not saying that i'm giving it up totally, but i'm def. taking a breather and i'm gonna try to find out who i'am. Because at this point i dont think i know who i am. Honestly, i see myself sometimes as someone who actually just wants to have fun (being a good)lol yes hard to picture but thats how i was before i ever moved to suwanee, ga. I swear i was a goodie goodie, i never got in trouble. Then everything changed high school and my friends. I mean yea..i've had some really good times but i really wanna find out who i am. 


I cant wait to have that bon-fire soon. lol yess! I get to hang out with john and karen tonight. yay i miss them both so much. Now we can wrestle and throw marshmallows at eachother in my driveway. Like the old days!

so latley i've been reading the bible. Its so powerful, and amazing.
 
 God wants you to be pure-in every way. He wants your thoughts to be pure.
He wants your actions to be pure. He wants you physically, morally, spiritually, and sexually pure. He doesnt want you to just look good. He wants you to be Beautiful through and through. Its a two-step process. You make the decision to allow the lord to work in your life; then he does the purifying. He does it by renewing your mind with His Word and be speaking to you by his spirit. the process may not always be pleasant for you, but god will not leave you in the fire to burn up. He will bring you out at the perfect time to finish the process.

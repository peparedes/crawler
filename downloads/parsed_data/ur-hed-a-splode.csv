"event","this morning was lovely. 
woke up, got dressed, went down to iq credit union to deposit my paycheck. 
it was closed. 
then&nbsp;i intruded upon kaila and her mother and used their printer to print off my resume. 
we had a long discussion about robert downey, jr. and movies and cable and edward norton and stuff. 
she lent me chaplin and heart&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;souls on dvd (i have the latter on vhs), as well as the starfucker cd. 
it's good. 
then kaila and i went for a stroll downtown. 
i dropped my resume off at mon ami. 
we went into mermaid music on the off-chance that they'd have something i'd want for $6 or less. 
they did! i bought the essential cyndi lauper. hooray! 
we went in and talked to david, one of the owners of one world merchant, for quite a while. 
he's very friendly. 
i want everyone to shop at one world merchant. their stuff is a little expensive, but they're struggling and i like them and their store. 
plus they're having a huge sale to pick up foot traffic. 
then we continued walking and talking. 
then i went home and my mom drove me out to one of&nbsp;the open branches of iq and we deposited my check. 
hooray! 
and before work, i want to get myself a pumpkin milkshake. 
hells yeah."

It's starting to dawn on me that that might not happen.
I'm a little nervous. 
Actually, I'm a lot nervous.
Now that I'm an 'adult' and directly affected....it's a lot realer than any of the past elections that were out of our hands.
Goodness, I don't know what we'll do.

Think about it. Despite your political standing, imagine whoever you want to win. Imagine if you don't vote. Now, imagine if they lose by a single vote.
Kind of on your shoulders, huh?
The deadline's creeping up. 
Please, don't give into the apathy that has come to be expected of our generation.

on the 21st, i saw uncle monsterface with harry and the potters. 
at long last, i say.&nbsp; 
i've loved uncle monsterface for&nbsp;quite a while now. 
AND they opened with Like A Prayer by Madonna.&nbsp; 
and the actual&nbsp;uncle monsterface (giantsockpuppetmonster) dressed like&nbsp;the pope,&nbsp; 
but with no pants on and his pope robes cut way high up to allow for dancing. 
glorious. 
fate? i think so. 
and marty allen, the lead singer, gave me a free sticker before the concert started for my ""time, business, and niceness"".&nbsp;:) 
and during the show, i requested Chocula pretty softly, but i was against the stage and he heard me and laughed. 
but didn't play it. 
but after the show when i was getting a picture with him and a hug from him, he sang me a song about pluto. 
:) 
math the band was good. real good. 
jason anderson and the best were good, but not quite fitting with the theme of the show. 
and harry and the potters were kicking. as usual. 

pictures are up on my facebook and myspace.

Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need

You say you're looking for someone who's never weak, but always strong
To protect you and defend you, whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down

You say you're looking for someone who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes to you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe

You say you're looking for someone to pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life and nothing more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe

"event","<i><b>chode</b>   n or adj   1. a derogatory term. Notes: in many areas, refers to the portion of skip between the scrotum and anus. Therefore, being a chode is undesirable. In other areas, the word lacks a true translation, the closest equivalent being ""moron."" (""You are such a chode!"" or ""You chode!"") Supplemental information provided by Ben Kirkham, Eau Claire, WI, USA, 4-6-1997. Michael Venables adds the following: ""My understanding of the origin of 'chode' runs something like this: while chode is used now for 'moron' its earlier use referred more to country bumpkins, hicks, or Okies. The main character of John Steinbeck's classic Depression-era Okie novel The Grapes of Wrath is Tom Joad. We get 'chode' from 'Joad' due to poor enunciation and ignorance of the source.""   2. a short, stubby penis. penis insults (list of) anatomy (related to) </i>"

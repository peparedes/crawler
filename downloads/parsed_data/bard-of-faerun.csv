"event","This past weekend was the North American QSO Party, a amateur radio contest where hams try to get as many contacts in 12 hours. Until this weekend, I had not had any luck contacting the eastern states. Due to the contest, I was able to make radio contact with 10 new states including New York, Georgia, and Louisiana. It's neat when you do something you've never done before with your radio. I got a total of 21 contacts which is nothing compared with real contesters, but I think it's was a good accomplishment given my level of experience, equipment, and time constraints.

I also managed to make contact with a Russian station. Of course Russia is invading Georgia right now, but we didn't have time to talk about that. We exchanged call signs and signal reports, and then he moved on to the next operator."

We really packed a lot of things into our trip. For the first few days, I was attending a conference for work, so I missed the family activities.<br /><br />We visited the U.S. Capitol, and it was great. We got a tour through <a href=""javascript:void(0);/*1214442020481*/"">our representative's</a> office. They took us through the underground tunnels from the office building to inside the capitol. <a href=""javascript:void(0);/*1214442122234*/"">Our representative</a> was acting Speaker of the House, and she called a vote while we were in the gallery of the House of Representatives. Numerous representatives walked by us to cast their votes as we walked back to the office building to complete the tour.<br /><br />We saw the national portrait gallery, the Air and Space Museum, the Bureau of Printing and Engraving, and the Library of Congress.<br /><br />We met one of my graduate school roommates and his family at the National Zoo where we saw the giant panda chowing down on some bamboo. We also saw an elephant getting a bath.<br /><br />We also went to visit <a href=""javascript:void(0);/*1214442713220*/"">Jamestown</a>, the first permanent settlement in North America. We had a really excellent tour guide who interpreted the historical site in the character of a real 17th century woman who lived in Jamestown in 1623.<br /><br />After Jamestown, we went to <a href=""javascript:void(0);/*1214442776841*/"">Williamsburg</a>, the original capital of Virginia. We heard Patrick Henry's ""Give me liberty, or give me death"" speech, and I wondered if our country has become a mockery of its ideals. In post-9/11 America, we talk of balancing civil liberties with safety.<b> </b>Some might think it even unpatriotic to bring up a quote from Benjamin Franklin, ""<b>Those who would give up E<span style=""font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;"">ssential</span> L<span style=""font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;"">iberty</span> to purchase a little T<span style=""font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;"">emporary</span> S<span style=""font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;"">afety</span>, deserve neither L<span style=""font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;"">iberty</span> nor S<span style=""font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;"">afety</span>.""</b><br /><br />On the last day of our trip, we toured <a href=""javascript:void(0);/*1214443208375*/"">Monticello</a>, Thomas Jefferson's home. We had a tour of his house, a tour about the lives of the enslaved community that worked on his plantation, and a tour of his gardens.<br /><br />When we returned to the DC area in the evening, we had a delicious meal at a seafood chain we knew from the Boston area. We saw the Jefferson memorial as the sun set, and we drove by the White House and Lincoln Memorial."

"event","I've always felt that I couldn't really know how I felt about California until my first earthquake. Well, it's finally happened. There was a 5.6 magnitude earthquake a little north of San Jose, and we felt it where I live. I was reading to my boys when it started. The house was shaking. None of use really knew what was going on for a few seconds, and then I realized.&nbsp; The house of slowly swaying back and forth just a little bit.&nbsp; It lasted longer than I expected."

Low and behold, it worked. The tumbler is running <b>much</b> quieter now.<br /><br />I unloaded it after 7 days (last Thursday), and the results were mixed. Some rocks seemed nicely rounded and smooth, and some still had sharp edges.&nbsp; I took a few out and put the rest back in for phase 2 -- the fine grit phase."

"event","Today, I went to my first traditional opera, The Barber of Seville. I took my son to a movie theater where we could watch a live broadcast from the Metropolitan Opera in NYC. My son is 8, and he mostly paid attention. Of course, he was able to have snacks and drinks because we were in a movie theater. I think it would have been hard for him to watch live at an opera house.

When the music started, all these images from The Rabbit of Seville (the Bugs Bunny cartoon) came to mind, and I had to suppress a chuckle."

One of the my DW's Live Journal friends was having trouble installing SUSE Linux, and I thought it would be easier to help if I had a live journal account. DW was babysitting for our friends, so I had to fend for myself. By the way, I don't look anything like my avatar."

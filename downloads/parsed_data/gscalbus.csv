Given my past experience with pregnant people, they tend to either crave company or solitude. You could best answer which type Draco is, but he rather struck me as the company sort. If this is the case, then, given your living situation, I had thought you might consider hosting Halloween festivities of some sort. Most of the neighborhood seems to have learned and accepted that your are a Wizard by now and opening up your home for a few hours might appeal to your partner. Or not. I realize there are great risks with such a move, especially given your laboratory, but it is, none-the-less, something to consider.

And you know, since you all seem to hold your right to publicly complain because YOU have been wronged as being more important that figuring out what the problem is and figuring out how to actually solve it, I'm going to let YOU deal with any further fall out. I've warned you, you've called it ""lecturing"" and ignored it. I've tried to explain and been told that the information and experiences you've had are more important. So I'm now going to simply wash my hands of the matter. 

I am a busy man. I have a vampire to try and cure, a school to run, a replacement for one of my most important teachers to find, as well as someone to defend and support Slytherin house before we have a couple hundred more Snapes and Malfoys to deal with. I also get to figure out how to teach the other three houses that if you WANT someone to change, you need to give them a REASON to change instead of simply yelling ""That's wrong! Stop it!"", normally in a fit of complete hypocracy, and how to get my Potions Master sane again.

To Mssrs. Laytner, ""Z"" and McLane? I'm half tempted to encourage the Weasleys to take advantage of their OWN right to not have three more mouths to feed and take up their VERY limited funds and send you packing back to the street to deal with your own views that having the right to do something means you should do it.

To those on the street who are actually offering a bit of support to the Snapes? PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF MERLIN, DON'T STOP! You will not get any gratitude, especially from Severus, for a good long time, I suspect, and many of your ovatures of kindness will be quite rudely shoved away, but I beg you, be patient. IF you give them reason to like you, they will eventually return the kindness in their own way, and right now they really need the support and to know that someone cares and they aren't universally despised. What is needed here is lots of understanding and a certain degree of selflessness.

And to everyone else? Just DON'T antagonize them! Whatever you do! Slytherin House is represented by a snake, and rightly so - poke at them and they will recoil at best, bite at worst. Offer them (AND their loved ones, since Mssrs. ""Z"" and Laytner are so fond of pointing out ""they didn't do anything to Severus"", but are QUITE put out that he and Draco would harrass THEIR loved ones) no threat and it's quite likely that you'll be ignored at worst."

However, I have known both of the Snapes for a very long time. They were both my students and Severus has been both my collegue and my friend. At one point, he was my deadly enemy, and I emphasize the deadly.

Severus is not a man to triffle with when he is angry.

Since January he has been more dedicated to more causes than I've seen him dedicated to in a long time. It would be heartning if he didn't tend to choose difficult or doomed causes (or at least doomed sides of causes). Since he's been more dedicated, the stress of fighting for the causes has been higher, and the disappointment when he has ""failed"" has been higher. I also hadn't realized how much time he'd been spending away from Draco. 

I can't properly explain bonding, but a bonded couple share each other's emotions. If one is unhappy, the other feels it and eventually becomes unhappy as well. The emotions feed each other.

I was alarmed when Severus passed out at the end of the curse removal. I hadn't realized he was under that much stress.

Draco misbehaving, while not unusual, granted, was a bit more worrysome than usual. Make that a LOT more worrysome.

I'm not entirely certain what the final shove was, but as should be perfectly obvious, his temper and patience have both snapped. He is not the sort of man who tends to hand out favors, for many reasons, and one too many good deeds either rewarded and then apparently completely forgotten or, even worse, rewarded with ridicule is not good for him. Or, by proxy, anyone else. I am very, VERY fond of Severus...but he's bitter on his good days and flat out deadly on his bad ones.

This is a bad one. Actually, I would qualify this as a rotten one. Leave him alone until he manages to lose some of the stress. 

You will not get an apology. Severus rarely does apologies. As a matter of fact, I'm not sure he ever learned how. And don't think that he will ever forget this. He has a very long memory. Forgiveness is another thing he never quite got the hang of...it's part of why he's as bitter as he is. 

Just...please. Don't antagonize him. Even I don't know what's going on completely and that makes things even more dangerous."

I understand that you've been under a lot of pressure lately. We all have, but you've been dealing with all the little problems and for longer and so you've been under more pressure. This is part of why I said you could leave whenever you wished and lengthened your vacation to make up for the days spent here dealing with this new emergency.

I understand that your bond with Draco makes it so that if one of you is in a bad mood, so is the other, and that sets up a vicious cycle, etc. His actions, while not commendable, are quite understandable and while I wish you'd done something about them, I did not demand it for just this reason.

I've been trying to figure out how to explain this situation in Muggle terms, and I think I've finally managed. What we did was like surgery to remove something that shouldn't be in the body. The thing that shouldn't be there is gone, but there is still a danger of...""complications"" I believe is the word. Now, Muggles normally have machines to tell how the patient is doing as well as the patient themselves who are normally quite informative on how they're feeling.

I pity any doctor who ever has to perform surgery on Hisoka.

He passed out halfway through, so I have no idea if he feels better or not.

"event","I simply wished to introduce myself. My name is Albus Dumbledore; you might know me as Severus Snape's employer.

I found myself quite fascinated by the concept of these journals and as I'm always curious to know what's going on in Severus' life, decided to get one. I have friended a couple of you already - Draco, who was one of my students and Hisoka, since Severus has told me quite a bit about him - and hope to friend others as I read over your journals and get to know you.

I hope this message finds you all healthy and cheerful!"

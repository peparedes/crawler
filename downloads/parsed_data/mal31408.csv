"event","well... today was a good day... atleast it started off like that..
i told hilario last night i didnt wanna be friends with him nemore... i mean that sounds good to me considering we dont talk very much and im sick of feeling like shit when he talks to me and stuff... plus that hoe girlfriend of his... oops i didnt say that... but yeah... so its not too bad i guess... i just dont wanna deal with it right now and he dont seem to care about it too much so im not worried :P but today during the day was cool...
1st- ah, nothing interesting... about to make up our ending position before i go to bed though... ugh i hate these finals lol..
2nd-went over some review thing i need to do other than the fact i turned in my book... lol... but yeah... then watched more of the movie about PENGUINS! longer class bc of the senior thingie or w/e lol...
3rd- ah, worked on this paper that i did all of it ugh w/e wasnt too hard... got to kinda ""debate"" lol i couldnt spell that at first :P oh well...
4th- lol me and tara put like 22 slaps on our paper bc we had that many unused ones lol... and gave away 20! yeah we had alot lol...
advisory- played cards... i think me and lauren kicked ass today uh hum..
5th- took a test or somethin... dunno i dont think i did too well.. joy thats gonna bring my average down... i was just way off for some reason and i dont know why!... then talked to lauren... jd was depressed bc my friend told him that his ex? was pregnant or somethin with his kid.. lol kinda interesting but i did feel bad...!
6th- ah, that was a funny class! no doughnut? party today but were gonna have it tomarrow!... but yeah there are some funny stories in here...
mr bertrand((talkin bout the pope)): ""his birth certificate expired""
me: ""they do that?!?!""
bertrand: ""yeah""
me: ""when!?""
bertrand: ""when they die""
me: **sits and thinks** ""OH I GET IT!""

talkin bout diseases...
jessica: ""they had that back then??"" ((romeo and juliet days))
bertrand: ""yeah it was called disease""

bertrand: ""the statue was alwayz there, i just took the rock away from it""
me: ""OMG I GET ITTTT!!!""

bertrand: ""think of the first guy that looked at a cow and said 'im gonna drink whatever comes outta there' now thats bravery"" lol

bertrand: ""apothicary""
brittanie: ""OWWWWWW"" ((who knows why))
devo: ""did that big word hurt your brain??""

brittanie: ""devo go shave your head""
devo: ""no i dont want to look like that"" **points at bertrand**
lol fun times fun times!...


after school... ah just sat online lol basically i think that was all... ash stayed after so i didnt have to worry about her for a while... did my hair and all which for some reason took forever! lol prolly cuz it had been curly and all... ugh i think i need a new straightener it keeps going crazy on me lol!... then we went to practice which was alright... not too fun but not too bad... nothing bad happend then...
after church ((we had church afterwards))... i got yelled at by my sis bc i didnt know where in my purse her key was then my mom yelled at me bc i said somethin... ugh i was pissed! she alwayz does that... she like favors my sister over me...

now for the part of my journal which makes me use livejournal... my feelings... ((ima pretend like no ones reading =D))

i miss my dad... i miss him alot... i dont know why but this happens to me once in a while and i dont know if i have written it before but i really do... its so hard with out him bc i was a daddys girl... i dont even know how i was... bc i was never with him but i mean i just was... and it makes me cry realizing what all he has done to us and all... he treats us like crap and basically forgot ashleys birthday ((its friday))... which i know is hard for her... but omg if he did that to me... no one would believe how much i would cry... i dont know why i just really would... i dont know why but i seem to keep wanting to get close to my dad but that never happens and i know wont now that he has 5 kids total... me and ash, he adopted alex... and his 2 new kids... gosh i feel so left out though... im not the oldest... alex is by a lil over a month... and im not even in the middle... my sister is... i mean i have two children that are 14 years younger than me... that will be hard bc i would rarely be able to see them and all... i wanna be able to watch them grow up but now i cant... so whats the point in having 2 little sisters? there isnt one...

guys... ah, kelly knows what im going through.. im pretty sure every girl does... but theres like no one out there for me... i seem to ALWAYZ like guys that are taken... and then it brings me back to matt... shit i love that boy... its been over a year and i still love him... hes just so hard to deal with, he drinks EVERY weekend friday and saturday... and damn... it just really hurts and it hard... i dont know what to do about it... ive tried talkin to him but he dont listen to me nemore... i guess he dont think i care? actually i think i care about him more than neone... i really do... i just wish he knew that but it wouldnt work out between us... it didnt then so why would it now? i dont know i just care about him so much.. i wish there was less space between us or atleast that we could be as good of friends as we used to be... man, he was my best friend and is basically the best friend i have ever had ((no offense to neone)) but he has been awesome... without him i seriously dont know where i would be in life... its so odd knowing that your once bestfriend and the boy you love more than nething is basically no more than an aquaintance now... and that he may drink too much one night and do something stupid... i just cant believe i let all this happen... i shoulda never let us break up.. never... 

everything- all my friends are coming at me with their problems... i LOVE to help... but the wierd thing is that it is all at once and i mean i dont know what to do about everything... and im not gonna stop helping ppl so just bc of this dont think i wont help you bc i will... i just need to find more answers and all to everything... im tryin to put all my friends first and deal with thier stuff so that they are happy... i would rather that more than nething...

friends yet again- all my friends are changing so much... it sucks alot... i have lost so many friends recently and then i have like barely ne really good friends now i have kelly, tara, tiff, eryn, and jennifer... thats like all.. :( maybe next year i'll have more or somethin? i really dont know im just loosing them like crazy then i have friends backstabbing me and my bestfriends which is pissing me off soooo bad ((kelly you know who))... i just wish i could change all this... but i cant... i hate loosing friends and i feel like im goin back to how i was in bryan... where i got treated like shit by almost everyone i really never knew why i wouldnt do nething to neone... but i did... but im honestly not gonna put up with this shit nemore i cant... i just cant deal with it...

well i guess that is all i have to say... :("

"event","this girl at school had this and i figured i need some place to write down everything bc im gettin so sick of holding it in! lets see..... me and matt broke up about a week ago bc it was too hard with him in bryan and me in houston, later that night raul asked me out and were still goin out. i really think that breakin up with matt was good but i kinda regret it in a way bc i thought that we would stay together longer than 2 months. But im glad im goin out with raul bc i alwayz feel so happy when im around him and i when me and matt were goin out i was alwayz depressed and shit. and like now im alwayz hyper. so thats a good thing. earlier kelly called me a whore and it made me think for a while. what if everyone that knows about the movies thinks i am one too. i really dont want people to think i am. she says she thought i was good or somethin. idk y everyone thinks that. its like they think im a prep or somethin and it really bothers me sometimes bc i hate preps and i would hate myself for like forever if i was a prep. Im not all that good which people dont really seem to understand bc i rarely ever actually come out. but at the movies it was diff. i felt like i could do what i wanted and not be in trouble or w/e bc i dont like getting in trouble. it really messes up my life. oh well, jennifer started goin out with ben duhon or w/e. she said that he asked her out and she said yes. i was like omg hes so ugly and gay. idk how in the world she can go out with him but im not gonna like try and break them up bc i wouldnt want her to do that to me and raul. idk how much she likes ben but im gonna see how it works out. i hope they stay together for a long ass time. kelly is goin out with harland finally. he asked her out the same night raul asked me out. i was soooo happy when he said he was gonna ask her out. shes liked him for a while and shes wanted to go out with him. but theres one thing i dont understand he says he loves her sooooo much but before he asked her out she asked him out and he said no... but y now is he sayin he loves her so much? idk its really wierd i guess. its a pretty day out and im stuck bored at home with my mom and rob. my mom just got out of the hospital last night bc she had surgery for her epilepsy. its a good thing she did though, bc it takes her off alot of her medication which will save us some money. my cell is still out of minutes bc my dad seems to never get around to buyin me min. its like he doesnt even remember me or somethin. it gets so annoying bc alex has all this shit that my dad has bought him but when my dad comes or w/e he barely buys us anything. he gets $10,000 in vacation money and buys lena like $3,000 worth of clothes and then wont buy us anything. when he came for christmas he bought lena all these maternity clothes and baby stuff bc she was gonna have twins. they were born early and died the next morning. they were almost 3 months early. im in a way glad they died but also in a way very upset. i think that he would treat those kids so much better than he treats me and ash and i honestly think that i would get jealous bc he never saw me and my sis when we were growing up and he would alwayz be there for them. he left to go work 3 days after i was born and has been with me for 2 of my actual birthdays and none with ash. i think that is really stupid of him bc even though lena hates us we are his kids and he needs to learn that we are supossed to be before her."

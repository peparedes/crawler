"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four months ago I was constantly binging and feeling terrible about it and yet I had no power to do anything to stop it.&nbsp; I had a spiritual experience of coming to believe my higher power could restore mre to sanity with my food&nbsp;&nbsp;and after that I was able to stick to a food plan.&nbsp; I don&#39;t step on the scales every day.&nbsp; I only weight once a week, but because I stick to my food plan I know that I am eating what is healthy for my body.&nbsp; I don&#39;t&nbsp;feel the need to express spiritual sickness by the food that I eat.&nbsp; I don&#39;t starve myself, but I eat exactly what is on my food plan.&nbsp; I don&#39;t count calories and I am not obsessed with exercise (though I do try to exercise 4 or 5 times a week for about a half hour), though&nbsp;I have lost a large amount of weight.&nbsp; I don&#39;t feel as though the goal is to lose weight however, but to abstain from compulsion in my eating behavior and to eat the food that is healthy for my body and soul. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#39;t know where I am going to end up in terms of my weight.&nbsp; For now I leave that to my higher power.&nbsp; I know that in time all things will be revealed to me.&nbsp; For now I am happy in the knowledge that I am free at last.&nbsp; Free of compulsive overeating, free from dieting and purging and starving myself.&nbsp; I trust that my higher power will show me exactly what I should be eating and when.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we have what you want, I invite you to join us.&nbsp; There are meetings in most areas and if there are not meetings where you are, there are phone and online meetings.&nbsp; We are here to give you support.&nbsp; Welcome to Overeaters Anonymous.&nbsp; Welcome home."

"event","<em>On action alone be thy interest, never on its fruits<br />Bhagavad Gita<br /><br />W</em>hy am I still obsessed with weight? I&#39;m abstaining, I&#39;m trying to work the steps; but I can&#39;t give up the scale. I&#39;m terrified to stop the constant monitoring of my weight. What if I gain? How will I know it if I don&#39;t weight?<br /><br />The problem is, I&#39;m trying to work this program without giving up control. but is that possible? The first three steps make it clear that those who wrote them, and millions who followed, proved they could only recover by letting a Power outside themselves regulate their unmanageable lives.<br /><br />If I say I have faith in a Higher Power, I can take the next step and turn my weight over to that Power. I can concentrate on taking the action--abstaining and working the steps--and leave the results to God.<br /><br />For Today: If I stop &quot;supervising&quot; my weight loss, it will be taken care of-- in God&#39;s time. I pray for the willingness to do that."

"event","I&#39;m thrilled that I got through day 5. Went the entire day without eating sweets or binging. I&#39;m so happy. I feel a better connection to my higher power. It&#39;s as if my mind is able to focus better on my higher power or something. But there&#39;s a connection with my hp that I didn&#39;t have before.<br /><br />I&#39;m excited to get more days of abstinence.<br /><br />It was helpful having the other people in overeaters_anon help me out. I like that.<br /><br />I had a bag of candy that I bought last week at the Menards. My husband dropped me off and I bought it and secretly ate several pieces. The bag was on the floor near where I do my yoga in the mornings. I keep looking at it so tonight I took it with me to a class I take and I gave it to the person who runs the store where we have the class. I asked her to give it to customers. She said she could use it and she seemed happy to get it.<br /><br />I&#39;m concerned because on thye 7th I have to go to a party. I <i>want </i>to go to the party.But I don&#39;t watn to drink the alcohol or eat the sweets.&nbsp; It could be a real challenge.&nbsp; I need to get some help and advice from my OA friends.<br />&nbsp;<br />On to day 6!<br />&nbsp;<br />D<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","So today is another good day so far.  I'm on day 5.  Yay!  I have been sugar free, three moderate meals and one snack per day.  The snack is normally fruit, but I allow myself a carb or dairy.  So it's good.  I've done this before and I'll play with my abstinence as I go along. I'll probably do some weighing, but I spent too much time in HOW doing that.  

I just got so sick of binging.  Last week I was to the point where I woke up and realized I'd rather jump off a bridge into the Mississippi in the middle of winter rather than have another binge.  I just can't take it any more.  
  
So that is why I have food abstinence for today."

"event","I did well today.  Yay!  I went to two different gocery stores and remained abstinent at both of them.  At one of them I got a medium portion of a main dish at their buffet.  After that I was so used to grabbing a sweet thing and I did not do it.  It felt odd.  I'm not really having too many withdrawal symptoms.  I have come to realize that this abstinence business is about an inner focus on my higher power.  It's a constant focus similar to the focus I find in meditation.  I was concerned about going to work today since I was concerned about the withdrawal.  But I went and it was fine.  Right now I feel hungry, but I don't know wny.  

The times in the past I've been abstinent I spend more money on food that I might really  like that is on my food plan.  So I stopped at the store today and bought some wild caught salmon.  I will look forward to that for tonight.  

I hope the other people in overeaters_anon community are doing well with their abstinence.  I think their writing has really helped me."

"event","""But I'm too weak. I'll never make it!"" Don't worry, we have all thought and said the same thing. The amazing secret to the success of this program is just that: weakness. It is weakness, not strength that binds us to each other and to a higher power and somehow gives us the ability to do what we cannot do alone.


With the help of you and my higher power I can be abstinent today."

Maybe I'll go play with the apocalypse-bringer and start my own little game of it...

Sebastian, pet, have you found yourself yet?"

<lj-cut text=""Sebastian"">
Sorry if I gave you a fright, pet. After Angel played a nasty trick on me and took my plaything, I met up with an old friend. She tried to follow me home, so I brought her to an old warehouse to play. I must be quiet though, because she's sleeping, and I don't want to wake the precious thing. 

I'm certain you can think of a good use for her, love."

My terms or nothing, daddy. The stars carry news, and they say you'd better be good, else the skies could open and take the slayer back from whence she once came.

I shall come to you at the time we are to meet. Have no worries, the toy comes with me, but you shall not be able to touch it. That much has been seen to."

<lj-cut text=""Spike and Angel"">
How much is a Slayer's soul worth? 

Think about it and let me know by sunset Friday. 

Until then, I'll be busy dancing in the singing sunshine.</lj-cut>"

The Slayer is awake...she will come to play again...This time light will bathe all that is outside...but inside is blacker than night...

A creature rose from the ashes and whispered in my ear. It told me where my Spike has gone. Angelus too. There's a big party in Cleveland and nobody invited ME...Spike and Angelus are no fun anymore. I <i>hate</i> that Slayer. 

I'd better go find a pretty dress, I've got to look my prettiest when I get to the party..."

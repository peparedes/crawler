Have u ever sat and really watched one of the local commercials in auburn?  Oh they're bad.  I refuse to buy from any place that makes a bad commercial because I'm afraid they will take my money and use it to buy another commercial."

"event","I have no tests for a while in my classes, so I can skip class more often in the next couple of weeks. 
Walmart is my growshury store of choice.  I got ice cream n cereal and soup and other fine dishes.  

Tomorrow, I shall sleep in before my lab at 5:00.   




Before I go, I will leave u with some thoughts:


Have u ever eaten so much in one sitting that you are filled beyond capacity, and your grossly enlarged stomach actually makes breathing difficult?   Neither have I.  

Have u ever seen somebody walking in front of you stumble a little bit but recover before they fall?  Don't ya just wanna go ahead and help em out by pushing them over so they dont feel like they left their fall incomplete?"

"event","I'm sitting here in just a towel.  Yes, I just showered and haven't quite gotten around to dressing myself.  

This week has been ok, I've had better.  

Here are some things that Andrew thinks people should never ever do:

1.  Put quotes in their away messages that don't explain what they are actually doing.  
2.  Give the full name of a course that they are taking as if to impress other people.  
3.  When turning left in traffic, slow down drastically and ease slowly into the left-hand turning lane, all the while holding up people behind you.
4.  Try really hard to do well on a test and then still do bad.
5.  Talk non-stop and cut people off when YOU should be listening.  : )
6.  Drive slowly in the fast lane on interstate 85.  
7.  Tell somebody you are gonna do something then not do it.  omg?
8.  Walk all the way to a chemistry lab and forget you were supposed to wear tennis shoes and have to walk all the way back to ur car to get them.  


I've done that last one by the way."

"event","Today I cut some grass.  I went to Lowe's to purchase a grease gun and grease to lubricate the mower on my tractor.  Simple procedure, yes, but the grease gun I think was defective.  So I messed with it for literally 45 minutes and finally gave up and took it back to Lowe's.  So basically I wasted over an hour before I resumed my cutting with a now-squeaky mower.  

And when I came home and blew my nose...  wow.   I should have saved the kleenex to show everybody all the dirt n stuff that came out.  I coulda potted a plant with that.  

Then Beth called and notified me that she was in town.  So we went and had dinner at Outback.  Always a pleasure.  She was her usual drunk, tipsy self.  Then we went to Walmart so I could get some blank CD's where we saw Bess May and her boyfriend.  I had not seen her in a while, and she is still pleasant and lovely of course.

Tomorrow, I will finish cutting grass.  Cheers"

My mother has had a hysterectomy and tummy tuck and cannot walk very far or fast and cannot drive, so I have had to drive her around today.  I think she likes to be pampered beyond need.  

We had Steak n Shake for lunch.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with no mayonaise.  Of course, when I received it, it had mayonaise on it.  So back to Steak n Shake I went to wait in line more and get what I want.  The girl had an attitude too.   ohhhhhhh (you betta CHECK yoself befo you WRECK yoself).  J/k I didnt really say that.  

I shall drive back home tomorrow in the afternoon or perhaps Monday and skip my morning class.

I am watching 28 days later now, for the 2nd time while I talk to people.  I just ate some soup.  : )

Big Kitty likes soup remnants.  

Tomorrow, I will be going to Dothan to visit my parents.  Hopefully, it will be worthwhile."

MattArt18: lol


[23:06] mdeav: i really wish i could slap the sense in you into dating me
[23:06] mdeav: it would have made my life much easier
[23:06] ChristianBMW325i: lol why is this
[23:07] mdeav: i wouldn't be lonely all the time and would have someone with all the qualities i desired

We went to Wal-Mart afterwards and I got groceries and some things.

It appears Ivan is still alive.  I'm hoping it with strengthen and come by and wipe out my trailer (when im not there).  I've seen some new furniture in Pier One that I like lol.  Insurance can pick the tab.  

I'm now in between classes.  I have an agonizing biology lab at 5:00 (attendance is mandatory so I can't skip it) that will last too long.  

BTW, I've found a new drink that I like...  Propel Fitness Water (lemon flavored)  It's quite good.  

This coming spring semester will be interesting.  I will be participating in a doctor shadowing program that will be all volunteer work.  I will do everything that nurses and LPN's do, including draw blood, but I won't get paid a dime.  Let's hope it assists in getting me into med school.  

Don't you just admire people that struggle and struggle in classes, studying their butts off and writing down every little note.  Then when test time comes, they still do bad on it?  lol.   Ya neither do I."

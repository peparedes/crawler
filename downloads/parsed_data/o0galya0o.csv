"event","Lilah crept back into the Slytherin Common room. Blaise was there with a pile of books.
""What have you been doing Lil?"" Blaise asked with a grin. ""Or who?""
Lilah stuck her tongue out at him and sat next to him.
""Nigel is a gentleman,"" Lilah smirked. 
""You mean wimp,"" Blaise smirked.
""He's nto a wimp. It takes a while to get ready to have sex. I mean we're only 15. How long do you think it will take you?""
Blaise looked up at her with a smile and looked back at his book. ""I've already had sex luv.""
Lilah's eyes grew big and she sat back. ""Oh.""
Lilah was quiet thinking then sat up. ""When?""
""When? Oh, right before fourth year was the first time,"" Blaise said causually.
Lilah counted in her head. ""You were thirteen!""
""Yeah, I know. Pretty young. But, I've always been into girls,"" Blaise said.
Lilah nodded. ""True.""
""Who was it?""
""Oh this girl who lived across the street. She was my best friend Julian's sister. She was thirteen too. Well, we had been on and off every summer since I was like ten. Me beign away and all, and one afternoon it just happened in her room. Her parents were out.""
Lilah sat in awe and feeling body get hot. 
""So you've been with how many girls since then? Not alot I mean has only been two years,"" Lilah giggled.
Blaise sat back counting in his head. ""Probably around twenty.""
""Twenty!""
Blaise shrugged.
""But...you're...""
""Lily,"" Blaise said softly, ""I started early 'cause I felt like it. Nothing wrong with it. You probably won't be as quick as me and the better for it. Boys get a good rep and girls become sluts. I don't want you to be seen as a slut, so do it when you want.""
""Okay,"" Lilah said. ""But twenty! Do you even remember their names? Or even her name? The first one?""
""Oh yeah, was Adrienne. Cute girl. Saw her again this summer. Shagged her in the park.""
""In the park? Actually in the park?""
Blaise laughed, ""Yes. It was an easy shag. She hasn't gotten over me. Still has on the ring I gave her when we were like twelve. I talked her into doing it behind the hedges.""
""In public!""
""It was night, but I sorta get off on the thrill of getting caught.""
Lilah shook her head in fake disgust. Truthfully she was impressed and a little jealous. She wished she had that power over her body to make boys do what she wanted.
""You must be proud,"" Lilah huffed.
""I am actually. it is amazing what I can make girls do,"" he smirked and returned his eyes to his book."

"event","Athena rolled over on the bed, opening her eyes. Blaise was there with Lilah between them. He met her eyes and placed his finger infront of his lip, then pointed to Lilah who was fast asleep.
""What are you doing here?"" Athena asked softly.
""Lily, started to cry in her sleep so I tried to calm her down,"" he whispered back. ""You were out like a light.""
Athena didn't say anything and sat up slowly not to wake up Lilah.
""Your bed is hard,"" Athena muttered.
Blaise rolled his eyes.
""Do you mind always being left to babysit your sister?"" Athena asked.
""You say it like I am given a choice,"" Blaise smirked. ""My parents just leave for weekends, weeks sometime and I have to take care of Jali.""
""Where do they go?""
""Hell if I know,"" Blaise muttered. ""I'm gonna go check on my sister.""
Blaise got up and left his room for the one directly across from it. He opened the door cautiously and stepped in.
""Bonjorno principesa,"" he said softly and entered. ""What are you doing up?""
Inspite of herself Athena smiled to herself. He came back out carrying the half awake child, who was too old to be carried around, but you couldnt tell by her size. 
""I'm hungry,"" Jalona whimpered as he carried her down the hall.
Athena rose form the ebd and followed them.
Blaise had seated his sister in a chair and was looking through the kitchen for something to make for her. He turned to ask her what she wanted when he saw Athena and stopped. They stared at each other for a second as she took in the sight. Blaise Zabini, the playboy of Hogwarts, in his bare kitchen holding pasta, and a look of ease and tenderness. It suddenly vanished and a smirk went across his lips.
""Don'tt ell me you're hungry too. 'Cause you have to cook for yourself girl.""
Athena rolled her eyes and sat next to Jalona who was sucking her thumb with a sleepy look in her eyes.
""Are you gonna have supper with us?"" Jalona asked in her shy whisper of a voice.
""I don't know,"" Athena said. ""Lily and I were supposed to be back at the Snape's for supper.""
""Oh,"" pouted Jalona, obviously disappointed, which broke Athena's heart.
Blaise pretended not to be listening as he boiled the water. He was quiet while he made the sauce and the pasta and served it to his sister. He didn't eat until she was done and full then ate the little she left, though it was cold. Athena couldn't take it and left the table and went back into the room with Lilah.
This image of Blaise the big protective selfless brother was disturbing her. It didn't fit. She din't want to believe it. If she did, she would ahve to accept him as human. As worthy of fault. As no better or worse than her. 
She looked around his room again. Drawings by his sister on the wall and nothing else. His clothes neatly folded and clean in wardrobe. Nothing like the boys she knew form school. Their rooms full of clohtes and rubbish. Walls covered in posters of girls and their favorite Football team.
She ehard Lilah stir and was distracted. She waited for Lilah to wake up, apparently just watching her and Blaise play basketball was too much for her delicate body. Athena laughed to herself and looked out the window. The sun was setting. They needed to head home. She should awaken Lilah. She should. She reached forward and saw Jalona starring at her formt he doorway.
""Lily is sleeping,"" Jalona whispered.
""I know, but we need ot go.""
""No, don't go. Stay. We can play with my dolls,"" Jalona suggested cheerfully and Athena wondered how many dolls this child could actually possess and in what condition. Her stomach clenched and she rose formt he bed without waking Lilah up and followed Jalona to her oom to play dolls.
Blaise cleaned up the kitchen when he noticed no one was starring at him like he was an alien and no little girl was following him around. He headed down the hall quickly. He heard giggling form Jalona's room and opened the already ajar door. Athena sat on the floor with his sister playing with her four dolls. 
""Wanna play?"" Jalona asked cheerfully as she noticed her brother.
""No, I don't play dolls sweetie. I'm a boy,"" he smirked leaning against the door.
""But you always did before? You were a boy then,"" Jalona said.
Athena let out a giggle and Blaise mocked her. Athena retaliated in the only matue way she knew how and stuck her tongue out at him. Blaise laughed and they starred at each other again. Athena felt her stomach jolt suddenly and looked away.
""We need to go,"" she said getting up quickly.
""No,"" Jalona pleaded.
""We do honey. I'm sorry.""
Athena walked quickly passed Blaise and into his room where Lilah was still asleep. She shook her. Lilah woke up up whining as would be expected, but quickly got up when she nticed the sky color of black.
The girls grobbed their coats. Lilah gave Blaise a big hug and kiss ont he cheek and hugged Jalona. Athena stood a little to the side and waved as both headed to the fireplace. 
""Come back to play more,"" Jalona said with a smile.
""I promise,"" Athena said.
Then Blaise snapped coldly, ""Don't make promises you can't keep.""
""We'll be back tomorrow,"" Athena shot back at him.
""We will?"" Lilah gasped. 
""Yes,"" Athena said curtly.
""Oh, okay. Brilliant! See ya tomorrow!""
Then the two girls left through the fireplace with a flash of green flame.
""Why don't people stay a long time?"" Jalona asked her brother.
""Cause they suck.""
""Oh."""

"event","Justin: Allright?
Nigel: I'm fine.
Justin: I mean with the whole Lilah thing.
Nigel: I'm fine. I'm moving on. I'm a big boy.
Justin: You're in bad shape aren't you?
Nigel: I just told you I'm fine!
Justin: If I were you I'd take all my things, the most important things, and put them in storage. 
Nigel: What is wrong with you?
Justin: Particularly glass.
***
Nigel was reading on the lawn. Sally was being given a piggyback ride from Justin. Hannah was giggling as she flirted with Zach. Ernie and Susan were both playing a game of chess contently. 
It was a fact that during the spring couples always doubled. Nigel pretended not to notice this as he turned the page of his book. Sally was laughing loudly as she wrestled Justin to the ground. Zach was whispering in Hannah's ear. A Ravenclaw couple began to snog across from Nigel. Hermione walked by holding Ron's hand. Blaise strutted down the grass towards the lake with the Patil twins on each arm. 
Suddenly Nigel's book snapped shut. 
""Can't anyone read in peace anymore,"" he growled and stomped back to his dorm.
His friends looked over confused. Justin excused himself from Sally and ran after Nigel. He ran inside the common room and saw a few students staring up the stairs towards the boys dorm alarmed. 
As Justin scaled the steps he heard screaming and objects breaking. When he opened the door to his room a book came flying at his head. He ducked out of the way and saw Nigel throwing another book at the wall. Nigel's bed curtains were ripped off  and on the floor. His broomstick was dangling out the window and his cauldron was dented severly on the floor, by other destroyed belongings."

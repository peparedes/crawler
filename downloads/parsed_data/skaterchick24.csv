<UL>
<H3>Your Existing Situation</H3>
<UL><FONT color=#ff0000>Persistent. Demands what she feels to be her due and endeavors to maintain her position intact.</FONT></UL><BR>
<H3>Your Stress Sources</H3>
<UL><FONT color=#ff0000>The existing situation is disagreeable. Has an unsatisfied need to ally herself with others whose standards are as high as her own, and to stand out from the rank and file. Her control of her sensual instincts restricts her ability to give herself, but the resulting isolation leads to the urge to surrender and allow herself to merge with another. This disturbs her. as such instincts are regarded as weaknesses to be overcome; she feels that only by continued self-restraint can she hope to maintain her attitude of individual superiority. Wants to be loved or admired for herself alone; needs attention, recognition, and the esteem of others.</FONT></UL><BR>
<H3>Your Restrained Characteristics</H3>
<UL><FONT color=#ff0000>Remains emotionally unattached even when involved in a close relationship. </FONT>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Becomes distressed when her needs or desires are misunderstood and feels that she has no one to turn to or rely on. Egocentric and therefore quick to take offense.</FONT> 
<P></P></UL><BR>
<H3>Your Desired Objective</H3>
<UL><FONT color=#ff0000>Tries to escape from her problems, difficulties, and tensions by abrupt, headstrong, and ill-considered decisions. Desperately seeking a way to escape, and there is danger of reckless behavior to the point of self-destruction.</FONT></UL><BR>
<H3>Your Actual Problem</H3>
<UL><FONT color=#ff0000>The need for esteem--for the chance to play some outstanding part and make a name for herself--has become imperative. She reacts by insisting on being the center of attention, and refuses to play an impersonal or minor role.</FONT></UL><BR>
<H3>Your Actual Problem #2</H3>
<UL><FONT color=#ff0000>The fear that she might be prevented from achieving the things she wants drives her to the exploitation of all types of experience, so that she may categorically deny that any of them has any value. This destructive denigration becomes her method of concealing hopelessness and a profound sense of futility.

"event","soo yah this is about my trip to palm springs. i smoked like a whole pack of cigarettes. i decided to stop smoking. haha yah...random. well i have to admit that palm springs wasn't bad. i was wrong, i actally had fun. lemme break it down...

ride there- well first we went to breakfast, twas interesting. then we hit the road. boring. took us two hours. to kill time, john decided to play a game. called the ""Car Race."" object: look at a car that is kinda far away from you, guess what race the person driving it is. (i know, kinda racist, but it was john's idea.) however, if you guess the person's gender you get an extra point, and if you guess their age (old, young, middle age) you get another point. so you have a chance of getting 3 points per car. john won. my mom got 2nd. i got 3rd. jeff got 4th...yah. it was fun. oh yah, we drove through gardena...hottest guys ever.

hotel- not as hot as i expected. nice hotel. huge pool. golf course, it was cool. went to the room. i watched spongbob till it was over.

john's house- we get there. nothing really happens for awhile. after awhile i go swimming with andy, john's lil bro. hes so cute! then, i hung out with danielle. shes cool. i give ya the story on her later. then, jonathon came over. acted like an ass. we got pissed at him, but he threw a box of cigarettes at us. so we were happy. my parents leave. i stay. hang out in the hot tub with john's mom (shes so cool. she acts like shes my age. she lets us smoke, drink, whatever. shes cool), john's sister sandy, and his step-sister daniell. then we want to get jonathon back for being an ass. so, her mom makes us fake vomit to throw on his car. it looked so nasty. excatly like vomit. so we drive to the gas station (me, sandy, and danielle). they are like closed and we just wanted gas and a lighter. but we were like standing there and this really hot guy was standing there too and he had a lighter, made us happy. and like his hot asshole friend was like ""you guys goin to a party?"" and we're liek ""no"" and hes like ""well then why'd you steel mommy's car?"" and sandy is like ""thats my car"" and hes like ""yah, right. i bet you only have your permit"" and shes like ""IM 20!""  asshole. he didnt believe us, so when we were drivin away, daniell was yellin things at him and givin him the finger and shit. it was so funny. then...we start following jeff, john and jonathon. they see us, we keep following them, realize we cant do the prank to them. go back to the house cuz jonathon went home. walk to jonathon's house. get attacked by a dog. drive to this guy brians house (only sandy and i) and throw the vomit on his car. looked real. i was like leaning out the window. good times. then...we went back. i slept in john's room on his futon. it was really fun. i like his family. gary is cool too...oh yah, john's mom kept telling me i was beautiful and stuff. it was funny. maybe shes BLIND?

the morning- woke up in the morning at like 8 cuz it was too hot to sleep. i got 4 hours of sleep. call my mom. she comes to pick up me and jeff and john. i get in the shower. jeff and john do whatever. then we go to del taco for breakfast. good shit. then go back to the hotel. drop john off...head for the freeway.

drive home- nothing happened. i saw a lot of hot truck drivers. uh....thats it. heh. took us about 1 hr 45 min to get home. couldnt wait.

danielle- heres the story. she was good till she moved to c-city. she started usin coke and speed and shit. lost 10 lbs (good way to loose weight). she realized it was bad and stopped. her dad found out and got pissed at her. she was like ""i wanna kill someone i'm so mad"" he freaked out. put her in the mental hospital. they made her leave after 2 hours cuz they realized she wasn't crazy. her dad thinks shes depressed so shes taking zoloft. shes not depressed. so basically, her dad is crazy, and shes cleaned up. nothing wrong with her now. she has nice, hot boyfriend too.
i'm really tired now. c-city was fun. i wanna go back. john's mom really liked me. i saw a bunch of hot guys there...they all just look at you and smile. its weird. its like they're scared to talk to people. oh well. i went to bed last night at 7:30 and woke up at 9:30. it was awesome. i'm still tired too. heh. i'm out. late"

"event","Ok, same story as Nicole...
Had a test 2 weeks ago and a paper due for Phil class. Thought I ate it on both but suprisingly I got a ""b"". Grateful for forgiving teachers.
That was a happy thing monday night.
I submitted my candidate application and expect to be on the ballot on May 17 for the Noho Neighborhood Council. It is so awesome I can't believe it. I will be on a ballot, WHAT? Maybe I'll be President one day. The first woman. Yeah, thats it.
Other than that... just busy with school and work. 
My birthday is in one week exactly. 28... Not a whole lot of excitement going on but happy to be alive. Didn't think i'd make it this far. Happy Birthday Brenda!
Went to Dustin's house last night and watched Idol... getting sick of Carrie Underwood. She is good but she is like the SF 49er's in 91... too good. Got drunk with Mike.. but he stayed sober, which was no fun. 
But since i'm feeling better I thought I would celebrate. 
In fact I think will celebrate again tonight :)"

"event","After a long happy weekend here I am, back at work.
Last week I decided that I am going to run for my neighborhood council as they have a resident representative seat open. I think it is time to get involved rather than just talk and complain about things. 
I have to write a 125-word candidate statement and I am not sure what to say... 
If anyone lives in district 1 or North Hollywood (encompassing Vanowen to Lankershim to Chandler to Laurel Canyon, near the 170) vote for me!
I will be an active part of the community :)
Anyway, I am waiting to not be sick anymore so I can be baptized. I am very excited about it. I want the people I love there when it happens. Especially because it has been such a resistant subject for me.
Anyway, I hope things fix themselves for my distraught cousin... and to my other cousin who I had dinner with on Easter.... IT WAS BOMB. I just had lunch, guess what it was? ;)~"

"event","Today I watched a show on the history channel about the Spartans and the Athenians. 
During the show they talked about a warrior called ""Alcibiades"". 
This was a colorful character among the ""dry"" characters of the 4th century. He lost his father when he was 4 yrs old and was raised by the King of Athens Pericles. He was very handsome, brilliant (a student of Socrates) and a chameleon. He fought in the Athenian - Spartan war and after being accused of vandalizing several statues of the God Hermes he faced death. Fleeing, he ended up in Sparta whom he had been fighting against and ended up fighting on their side. Proving to be valuable because of his knowledge of the Athenians. 
I think I've found my new obsession.... :)"

I unwillingly filled my body with all kinds of antibiotics and I am still in bed, missing work.
Anyway, on the 14th of April there is a California Democratic Convention at the LA Convention Center. I think anyone who has some extra time to volunteer should. The training is April 14th and the convention begins on the 15th. If you are interested go to www.cadem.org/volunteer .

I dreamed that I was starting to get involved with Johnny Depp. I couldn't believe that he would be interested in me but it was such a great feeling because we were truly in love. Johnny Depp is hot and always will be.
I didn't want to wake up!"

"event","This morning I was listening to Democracy Now on Pacifica Radio (90.7 fm). 
Amy Goodman was interviewing Jim McDermott ( a democratic congressman).
Their discussion was about the ""No Child Left Behind"" Act. He was saying that there is a provision in the act stating that it is mandatory for High Schools to provide military recruiters with personal student information (phone numbers, addresses). If they fail to do so, they are jeapordizing their right to the funds available to them from NCLB. So basically, the government wants to harass the children of America to join the military. They will mislead the children into thinking that it is a great option for them, seducing them with money and fame (stating that being in the military is highly respected). I am not saying that it is not an honorable decision. I am merely saying that children should know what they are truly facing. War is not glamourous. 
It is absolutely disconcerning to think that this Act has such a pretty front and awful underlying motives. 
I personally read the Act in its entirety to verify that this was all correct information. Not only did I find that it was correct, I found other things that were frightening regarding prayer in school and sex education. 
The Neo-Conservative Administration that is making desicions for our country is heading us towards economic and social disaster. I urge you in any way you can to get involved. Don't believe that your voice isn't heard and that your opinion doesn't matter. IT DOES!
There is an anti-war rally on the 19th marking the 2yr anniversary of our occupation of Iraq. It is in Hollywood. Make your voice heard... BE THERE"

"event","This is my first journal entry... My cuzin Nicole introduced me and knows about as much about this ish as I do, that's why my page isn't all purty. 
At the moment I am ILL. So ILL that I don't want to get up. My throat is bigger than my head and everytime I swallow I feel like i'm swallowing a freakin turkey. My cuz was kind enough to bring me some antibiotics, which should make me feel better temporarily... (cuz you know what happens when you take antibiotics, ladies).
Anyway, my birthday is in about 3 weeks and I have a dilemma. I don't know if I should have my celebration on the actual day (which falls during the week) or on the weekend, when we can truly party. 
Oh well... I am not sure that this will be interesting enough to read... but it was cool to write..."

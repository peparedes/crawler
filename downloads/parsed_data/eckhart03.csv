My favorite one was ""Which of these did Jesus not say on the cross""...

and the answer:

""Behold your mother.""

HAHA, Can I use that one as a mom joke?

I am not worried I am not overly concerned
My friend implores me, ""For one time only,
make an exception."" I am not worried
Wrap her up in a package of lies
Send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried I am not overly concerned with the status of my emotions
""Oh,"" she says, ""you're changing.""
But we're always changing

It does not bother me to say this isn't love
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love
And I guess I'm going to have to live with that
But I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey,
Something in between,
And I can always change my name
If that's what you mean

My friend assures me, ""It's all or nothing.""
But I am not really worried I am not overly concerned
You try to tell yourself the things you try to tell yourself
To make yourself forget... I am not worried
""If it's love,"" she said, ""then we're going to have to think about the consequences.""
She can't stop shaking I can't stop touching her and...

This time when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind
""These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering for days,"" she says
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

But I'm not going to break and I'm not going to worry about it anymore
I'm not going to bend, and I'm not going to break and I'm not going to worry about it anymore
It seems like I should say, ""As long as this is love...""
But it's not all that easy so maybe I should
Snap her up in a butterfly net Pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried I've done this sort of thing before
But then I start to think about the consequences
Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and...

Thys time when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind
And everytime she sneezes I believe it's love and
Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake and Anna begins to toss and turn
And every word is nonsense but I understand and
Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away
It's chasing me away She disappears and
Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

<i>Brought to you by The Voice of Martyrs</i>


While working on the construction of a room at a school near Manga Mandi in Pakistan, Nasir took a break after becoming thirsty. He drew water and drank from a glass chained to a cemented public water tank next to a mosque, which was reserved for ""all"" poor people. Returning to the construction site, a Muslim man asked him, ""Why did you drink water from this glass since you are a Christian?"" The man accused Nasir of polluting the glass. The Muslim man yanked the glass off the iron chain, broke it and threw it in a garbage can. The man summoned other militant Muslims to the scene, furiously saying, ""This Christian polluted our glass."" Hearing this, the incensed mob began beating Nasir, yelling that a Christian dog drank water from their glass.

The militant Muslims encouraged bystanders to beat Nasir because it would be a ""good"" deed that would benefit them in heaven. The attackers pushed Nasir off a ledge onto the ground. The impact of the fall dislocated his shoulder and broke his collar bone in two places. This knocked Nasir unconscious and he did not regain his senses until he reached a clinic. A doctor told Nasir that some people had brought him there.

Nasir's father took him home and a VOM representative was alerted about the incident. VOMedical is helping with Nasir's medical treatment and is monitoring his recovery from the attack.

I don't know if I'm just a fool or if I'm doing something right.&nbsp; It's hard to tell sometimes.&nbsp; Honestly, All I want is more of Jesus and the Holy Spirit to fill my life, strengthen me with the gifts and tools and experiencve to do the work He has for me, and then guide me to the places appointed for me to go.&nbsp; But then all of the other lesser desires of my heart pile up inside me wanting to be fulfilled as I wait on the Lord and things just aren't happening yet.&nbsp; I hate waiting, it's the hardest thing to do, whether on God or on people,&nbsp;and especially on God because He's much better at keeping secrets and being patient with me than people are..&nbsp;I hope that God blows my mind in this new season with what He has in store for me, Wesley, and this campus and city. I just don't want to wait any longer because the desires of my heart are overbearing.

Just like with the gifts and tools that God has given us, so often our mind gets in the way, hindering us from using them for God's purpose and advancing His kingdom.&nbsp; Fear, Doubt and Disbelief... we just gotta let it all go.&nbsp; Trust not in logic or reason, or ""reality""... ""What is reality?&nbsp; If reality is what you can feel or see or taste or touch, than 'real' is just electrical signals interpreted by your brain.""&nbsp; No, I will trust in the Spirit of truth that guides us in all things, walking by faith and not by sight.&nbsp; Let it all go... free your mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

As a crimson tear kisses his wrist
He awaits the faint
to wash over him
as a gentle wave
And he is falling.

Blackness whirling around
His tears still gleaming
Red as the fires of hell
He lays back
and lets his life slip away
For what has he to hold onto?</I>


It's been so long....I hardly know what to type. Well...All I can really do is tell everyone that reads this that I've finally reached a level of mental stability. Took long enough, yes? Well, lets see...I'm sick right now, and it's sucking. I have to work tomorrow, but Lace is going to make me call in if I'm not better. By the way, I'm a part of the maintenance crew in some big ass sub-division/ranch thing that people have their houses in. I weed eat eight hours a day, unless I'm lucky, then I do something else for two hours, followed by the weed eating...I hate this job. It wears me out so much. I need to work in a bookstore or something. Grr, damn the country.

I'm doing well with the tattoo stuff. I've got a good start on a portfolio, but I need to get crackin' on it...I've been slacking as of late.

Guitar...meh, I'm able to play some stuff. I just made a cool little bit this afternoon. I'm not as fanatic about it as I was...I don't think...lol.

Well...I'll leave you with this famous quote...from me :D

""The song is called Stairway to Heaven.
 Of course there is going to be a satanic
 message when you play it backwards. Good
 backwards is doog."" -ME :D

P.S: Here's a good move for all you guys out there tryin' to please your ladies. When you're ""making love"" try swiveling your penis around in small circles...it seems to have a nice effect ;)"

"event","I need to keep up with this thing.

Well, not a whole lot has been going on. I'm dying to get a fucking job, but Chad seems to refuse to answer his phone, and though I have left him two dozen messages, he hasn't called back. I'd like that job, alot. Hard work, good pay, nothing better. Lacey and I have pretty much been sitting around doing nothing. Every once in a while we rent some movies to watch. We've rented about twenty to thirty movies since I've been here. Thats funny. I've been chilling, smoking my cloves, reading, playing Race War Kingdoms, reading...I'm fine. I worry about Lacey sometimes though. She gets so upset and frustrated when she doesn't have anything to do. Me personally, I'm fine with just sitting at home with my mind to keep me company, along with her, but I know that isn't enough for her. I wish I could provide the activity for her. Maybe I'll think of something.

I'm becoming more the anarchist with every growing moment. I've learned how to get things for cheap prices at stores, and how to steal from them efficiently. Lacey is loathe to this, because she's affraid I'll get caught and taken away. I've got more faith in my ability than that, but her worries aren't without reason. She knows precisely how mischievous I am, as do most of you. But, most of you also know how good I am at what I do. Anywho, I'm content, for now, with getting things cheaper. I also know how to make my own sandals out of old car tires, and such footwear would probably outlast most shoes that corporations sell. Also, I know key elements in inciting, and survivng through, riots. Also, great techniques in resisting arrest, and taking care of pigs vehicles. Much fun.

I need to call Matt today. I want to tell him something that Lacey and I are going to do. We're planning on getting a big apartment with a couple bedrooms so that Matt, Lacey's friend Eric, and Drew can come live with us. Naturally, all would chip in for rent. I think it would be fun, especially considering that the afore mentioned people are invited to bring their boyfriends or girlfriends. Plus the fact that Matt, Drew, and I are all so mischievous that we would never run out of fun. Maybe we could even make an anarchist house, and have our own little 'Viva la resistance'. That would be cool, haha.

I've been playing guitar more, and while it seems I'm getting better, I also don't seem to be making any progress at all. Neh.

Well, right now the Race War Kingdom site is under construction, so I'm going to go check it out and see if it's done. Laters people.

Love you Lace =)

"event","Okay, so I'm in these classes that are for help getting your GED, and the first day that I'm there the teacher (Ms. Bach) gives us all a locater test to see what education level we're at. So I take the test and she comes to me and says that I missed only one question. Thats great, I think, but what does it mean? Well, she suggested that I take a practice GED test. So I do half of the test that first day, and finish up the second day.

After I finished it, she came to me and told me that if you get a score of 3000 MINIMUM on a GED test, they give you a sholarship...my score was 3140! I was astonished at that...Needless to say I'm proud of myself for accomplishing that, especially considering how long I've been out of school.

As far as everything else goes, still no job. Lacey and I are bored out of our minds because neither of us ever have any money to go anywhere to do anything. Next friday my parents are FINALLY going to send me the money from my last check at the job I had in Las Vegas. If none of you know what that was, it was at a car wash. I made tips, plus six dollars an hour. Usually tips ran from ten to fifteen dollars a day, unless it was busy, then they ran from twenty to forty dollars a day, which was awesome.

Nothing else is new other than that...I miss Matt and Haley and Mari and Dustin and basically the old friends that have wedged themselves so deeply into my heart.

"event","Well, I'm living in Missour with Lacey now! :D

It is wondorously beautiful out here; it's been so long since I've seen green that hasn't been transplanted into the climate. My allergies were acting up a bit when I first got here, but I think they've calmed down. I'm now learning (teaching myself) how to play guitar, and I'm not doing too bad. I paint now, too, and I did this one painting with a night sky, made of black, blue and violet, all mixed together, then a bright white moon that lights the sky. Ahead of that is the silhouette of a mountain range with the moonlight gleaming off the ridges. At the foot of the mountains is a dark city line of light, and then a shore to an ocean which is reflecting the moonlight and city...I like it.

Yesterday was me and Laceys three month anniversary for having known each other in person, and having been living with each other. Tomorrow will be the ten month anniversary of when we met online :D

Also, I found out how to make a tattoo gun, and what I have to do to become a tattoo artist. Basically, I have to practice until I'm good enough at it to take on an apprenticeship with a professional. I'm looking forward to that...

Lately I've been having more and more of a desire to start something like Gothic Crusaders again. I can't quite understand the urge, but if I do it this time, it's going to be ten times as popular as the last. If any of you don't know how popular the last was, I got about twenty-five people to agree with me, and become willing to join in a movement. Now, while this is a widely spread twenty-five, from all over the world, I figure that if I can acheive that with strictly online preaching, I feel that I may do incredibly well if I were to stand on a street corner and shout my opinion to the masses...something to think about.

Naturally, I'll want to do more reasearch and start paying attention to the news of the past fifteen years. I am SO not up to date...lol.

I can't particularly think of anything else, so I'll leave you all with a bit of poetry that is going to be made up just this second.

In the castle of eternal dark
The mind wanders lost
Searching ever for the truth
The truth of meaningless night

Darkness of heart is the truth
Light of mind is the truth
Forever searching for the answer
To the endless battle of soul

In the catsle of eternal dark
Moonlight burns through
Barred windows holding my soul
Rusty triumverate mocking you

The metal laughing in your face
Not bidding you farewell
Torment as a small creature walks in
And steals your remaining life

In the castle of eternal dark
Light of soul shines bright
Through the darkness of eternal night
The mind tells lies to those who struggle

The sense of right and wrong
The truth and deception
All these things
Fade from life

"event","Well, long story. First off, we moved from Texas. We went to Santa Monica. We stopped in Arizona to see some of the family. I had a real good time there, met my cousin and me and him are pretty good buddies now. Then we left for Santa Monica. So we stayed here for a while, about a week, and I`m getting happy and excited because Lacey will be with me in a week.

Just this morning, right before we almost find a place to live, my mother decided that she`s going to send me and my father back to Texas. That she can`t handle being married anymore. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THIS?!

I`m sick and tired of moving. I`m sick and tired of unanswered prayers.

I almost, ALMOST started believing in god. I even prayed, with all my heart, begging to be helped in finding a place to live, asking to be looked over so that everything would be okay. I prayed that we would all just stick together, that I would be able to show Lacey the ocean.

*sigh*

So much for God.

Anyways...I`ll still be able to see Lacey. We`ll probably be going back to Dallas, or somewhere in Texas. I don`t want to go back to my grandmothers house though. I hate yardwork...
Bleh.

For the last three weeks, I`ve been living a dream. Not paradise and happy things, but I mean, it`s been like nothing is real. I got in three car accidents, and in not one of them was I scared, anxious, anything. I feel as though I`m walking through the worlds most complex video game.

Neh...

Anyways, I`m done for now. I`m going.

"event","You know what would be nice? If people would just be content with what they have in themselves and in their lives. Well...perhaps not content, but at least not so depressed about it. I mean, what is sitting around crying about how much your life sucks gonna do to make it better? I know I'm one to talk and all, considering the way I was only a year ago, but I've realized that it's so much easier to just take it as it comes, and do what you can to keep yourself happy. I'm not saying people gotta be happy and cheerful or upbeat or anything, I'm far from that myself, and I know everyone has their moments of that sinking feeling in your chest that makes you want to just give up. But it's easier, strengthening even, if you suck it up, and think of a solution to your problem.

Anyways...

Seventeen more days untill Lacey graduates. Then roughly a week untill her graduation party. Then one or two days before she comes here. I can't wait. It's going to be so perfect...

Um...got pissed off yesterday at my schoolwork, almost decided to drop out and go for my ged. Then switched courses and finished an entire course (geometry) in less than half an hour without even reading through the books. Got A's on all the tests.
I thought it kind of odd that I can handle math so easily, but enlish type things drive me insane. The other one was accounting, but that was just god-awful boring. Blegh.

Alright I'm done for now. Bye.

"event","Well, I don't feel like going into huge detail, so...

- Moved to Dallas

- Dyed my hair black

- Broke a doll of my grandmothers on moving day, then fixed it so well you couldn't tell, and both her and my mother were impressed

- Have been gradually painting my nails today

- Wore my collar yesterday, along with my trench coat

- Bought some blacklights yesterday

- Why is space black?

- Can't wait 'till June; Soooooooo soon

- My hair looks pretty

- Can't wait 'till I get my lipring. Maybe this week. Depends.

Other stuff too, probably, but I'm talkin' to Lacey right now and can't think of anything. Bye!"

"event","Well...I was thinking not too long ago, and I realized that I'm afraid of being touched. Utterly terrified. Waves of cold horror travel up and down my spine when anyone so much as taps me on the shoulder. But I need to be touched...I want affection, to be able to hug and hold and kiss and feel. Quite a terrible predicament, no?
Aye...afraid of being touched. It explains some things to me. But I don't want to be afraid anymore. More than that, I don't want to feel that way when I hold Lacey. I love her with all my heart. She is my entire world. I don't want to feel that way with her in my arms. What to do...

I have $14.

Today I found a way that I can hook my computer speakers into my cd player. Am happy about that, because I can finally listen to my cd's comfortably. Right now I'm listening to a techno song by Paul Okenfold on a burned cd that Dustin let me make, way back when I was in Colorado. Over a year ago. It seems like it was just yesterday, but at the same time, so long ago. So long ago that me and Matt left for Sterling, and my whole life was thrown into a hated chaos. Hmm... I miss Matt. Dustin too, but mainly, I miss Matt. He was a good friend. It's a shame that I'll probably never see him again, unless he'd want me to. Hmm...

Wrote a poem today, but naturally, I forgot to write it down. So much for that. Eh...done now.

Walking hand in hand with the love of your life,
Feeling warmth surround you, 
You turn your head to express your love,
And the light suddenly ends.

People run,
All around,
Screaming in terror,
Your love has their arms around you.

You hear their voice and feel their love,
Though you know you are leaving,
You try to tell them,
Once again,
The love in your heart,
But fail with the sweet taste of blood on your lips.

Then all is quiet,
And a tear falls from their cheek to yours,
And you can whisper the three words that burn within your heart.

You feel their love embrace you,
And their lips on yours,
So you smile and take joy in knowing that their life will be good,
And that they will find love like yours.

You feel an eternity of sorrow for leaving your love,
But the beauty of your death has brought you peace.

So she takes me up to my room, and tells me that she doesn't want me turning out like her, and still trying to decide who I am when I'm forty-five years old. (although, I know who I am, but thats beside the point) Anyway, she tells me that I can look however I want now, and that her and my father won't bother me or stop me about it, under one condition. That I don't grow long fingernails. LMAO I was like ""OKAY! :D""
Fucking great...lol I can wear what I want, get makeup, nail polish, piercings, tattoo's, whatever! Fucking rock on! *bounces*

Also, I can't wait to be with Lacey! I love her so so much, and I want to be with her forever. We've both come to the agreement that as soon as I'm eightteen, I'm gonna move out there and we're gonna live together :D
That will be so perfect...just being able to have her in my arms as we fall asleep, her being the last thing I see and hear, and me being the last things for her. I'd love that so much...

What else...OH! Haha, the essay I wrote for my homeschool shit. My parents thought I stole it from a website somewhere, and were gonna make me re-write it using my own words. Haha, it took some convincing but they FINALLY believed that I wrote it myself (which I did, thank you very much)

Ahh...yeah. The only thing I want now, is for it to be June. That'll be so great. *sighs happily*

'Tis a little warm, but not too uncomfortably so. I have a fan if I really need it. If I <i>really</i> want to I can pop open a window and let in some cool air, but I'm currently too lazy to do that.

I have decided to start working out again. Has been a while. I went into the garage and smuggled some weights up to my attic, and spent about fifteen minutes lifting those, then about ten minutes doing crunch's. I figure if I do that every day once or twice, I'll be in pretty good shape. I might even start jogging around the fields out here a little bit. Yeah...I'm just tired of feeling so...<i>gross</i>. Surprisingly enough, I felt really good after that little work out earlier. So yeah...I'll do that. It's also partially because I want to be in good shape for Lacey when she's here...haha, yeah...*grins and blush's*

Ahhh what else...I'm about as talkative in this thing as I am in real life...Thats not much, for those of you who didn't catch it. Yeah...I wish I had a stereo. I mean, listening to music on my cd player is all fine and dandy, but it just doesn't have the same appeal to it.

I gave myself a tattoo not long ago...a little cross on my ankle. Just drew it on with a sharpie, then cut it in right after, before the ink dried. It's still there, although I'm going to re-do it this evening.

Hm...okay, I'm done for now. I can't really think of anything else. Laters.

<b><u>From The Inside Out</u></b>

I'm on the inside
I wanna be outside
I'm on the inside
Let me out

I'm on the inside
You watch me cry
I'm on the inside
Let me out

On the inside
I play my little games
On the inside
I tear away

On the inside
I fight against your mind
On the inside
I dig my way out

(Chorus:)
From the inside out
I get through you
From the inside out
You can't hold me anymore
From the inside out
I'm not gonna lose
From the inside out
Walking through your mind like an open door

On the inside
I scratch against the walls
On the inside
I scream untill you fall

On the inside
You fight against me
On the inside
I want out

Going through the door
You try to stop me
Going through the door
You'll give me to the count of three

Going through the door
You'll be hurt if you don't stop
Going through the door
I want out

Ahhh ok what happened today...Um...went with my father while he job hunted (in my soon-to-be car: '86 olds cutlass) and we ended up having one of those supposed 'long and meaningful' discussions...in which I realized that my father doesn't know jack shit, and he hasn't seen the world change around him. *sigh*

I miss Lacey...we couldn't talk last night because her computer was being stupid...damnedable technology. I can't wait to meet her...it's going to be so perfect. I can actually see myself being with her...I can see my life with her...

I miss Matt. We used to have so much fun...Someday I'ma go see him. I might end up going back to Colorado even. I don't know. Who knows whats in the cards, right?

Hmm...odd things with myself. I'm finding that I'm forcing myself to become less soft-spoken and more confident in my words and actions. I don't know why, or where it comes from, but...it's for the better I suppose.

I got a new manga book a few days back. It's all horror stories...<i>the</i> goriest comic book I've ever seen. The first story is about this girl who is dumped by this asshole boyfriend of hers...she's all upset and decides to cut her hair, because she grew it out for him cuz thats how he liked it. But her hair is like...posessed, and ends up cutting her head off, then the hair (still attached to the head, mind you) like stakes out in the attic for a week and a half, and it's like stretched out so the head is kinda just hangin' there in the air, then the hair like goes off somewhere and kills the boyfriend. It's so gory...haha I love it. Oh my god...I swear, some of the things in this book are so horrifyingly sick; I find that there is a disgusting satisfaction in seeing them...it's just so...*shudders* hehehe...yeah...

Well...anyways...I finished another course in my homeschooling...economics. That was easy...*laughs* stupid american system of economics...I just have to do four or five more courses, and I'll be caught up for 12th grade. Then I'm going to try to get a job so I can have some money...you know, just so I don't have to sit around the house all day.

I'm going to talk to my father one of these days, and see if I can't get him to loosen up some. Both of my parents are worrying about the little things with me, when they're not realizing that I'm at the age when they should let that stuff go, and just make the rules be:
1) Don't do anything illegal
2) Be home by such and such time
3)Get your schoolwork done/ go to work
4) let us know where you're at/going.
Wouldn't that just make life so much easier? They wouldn't have to bitch at me for listening to the music I do, or about how I want to look...*sigh* Just maybe I can convince them.

Ooookay...well...am done now. Bub eyes.

While I can't directly play something I've heard without listening to it for hours, I can create my own tunes from them, and they usually turn out pretty good.>>>>>I'm bored...wonder if there's anything to snack on thats decent...eh...>>>>>My foot doesn't really hurt anymore, it's just swollen beyond all expectation. I really really wish I wouldn't be bit by spiders anymore. By any bug. I'd like to know what it's like to go more than a week with a body that doesn't hurt in some way. It kind of sucks...>>>>>Okay, I guess I'm done. I can't really think of anything else.

"event","God damnit. This is the second time that's happened. It's always in the middle of a somewhat important conversation too. Fucking power outages...*shakes fist*
Naturally, there isn't anyone online right now...figures. Oh well.

I read a comment from Matt in my old journal, and...well...he sounded very disappointed with me. I was talking to Dustin today and he said that Matt wasn't mad at me, he just thinks I need to get my shit together and get on with life. I agree, and as far as I'm concerned, I've been doing that. I told everyone about my journal so they could all read it and know about how I would get attached to people so easily (especially over the net) and hoped that would take me where I needed to go. So far, it has. I'm trying to be responsible, more confidant, and decisive with myself now...I don't want my life to be at a standstill forever. Now Mari, I'm so so sorry that I've hurt you, and I hate myself for it, and I still love you, but I honestly feel that I was chasing a dream that wouldn't have come to be with you...and I hate that, because it makes me feel like I was leading you on. But who knows what would have happened had we actually met. Lacey...she makes me happy. We're actually going to meet, in June. I love her...so so much.
So I'm sorry for the broken hearts that I've made, and for the ones I feel, but sometimes...I guess thats just how the world works...I don't like it...but I have to live by it.
*sigh*

"event","Well...today has been bleh. I've done nothing but sleep, read, and come online. It's about all I can do. It's really pissing off about this spider bite business...I was really freaking out this morning about how much it hurt, because it was just so painful...then later on, I managed to get some ice on it, and the swelling went down a bit (although my foot still looks fat) and it doesn't hurt anywhere near as much...

But yeah...the only thing that was passing through my head this morning was ""Oh god, it hurts, it <i>hurts</i>..."" Yeah...and I can take alot of pain, but this is just unreal. It doesn't stop. It isn't in waves or pulses. There's no suddens shock. It's just constant. You'd think I'd get used to it, but I don't. It always hurts. *sigh*

Anyways...I'm bored out of my mind. I'm also afraid that I'll never see my friends in Colorado again...
Which, the longer I'm away, the more that seems real.

I wish Matt weren't grounded...I want to talk to him about stuff...religion...Also, I just miss talking to him. As odd as this sounds, I really look up to Matt. He's better than me, smarter than me, and yeah...but even in all the time I've known him, he's never made me feel anything but his equal.

Mari...*doesn't even know what to say*

Well...I don't know...I guess I'm done for now. No one's on. Kelsey is, but her thing is set to 'busy' so yeah. *Stretch's* Time for <i>another</i> nap, I guess.

"event","Well...I had a rather odd conversation with Haley. She said I need to meet people that are real, and more than just words on a screen and a picture ever now and then. She's right too. I just hope my current relationship with Lacey becomes real...we're supposed to meet in June. I hope so much we do.

Also, I asked Haley if she was going to consider a long distance relationship with Matt. Then she asked me why I asked, and I told her it's because I love Matt like he were my own brother, and that I knew how much he loved her...then Haley had to leave...and apologized for ditchin' out on me...and asked me to please pray for guidance.

That another thing thats been bothering me lately. I've been reading these <i>Left Behind</i> books, and they're making me kind of want to start believing again, but I don't know that I can do that...if I want to, if I care, or if I feel like I'm ready for any sort of belief. I don't know...I just know that I'm feeling something deep in my chest that I haven't felt since I was a child...and that feeling seems to be supporting me.

*Yawns* I'm kinda tired...I ought to go to bed soon...

"event","Blah...I'm tired. I finally finished this book <i>Left Behind</i> that I've been reading. It was awesome, especially for a christian thriller. It kind of made me question some things as far as beliefs go...
I'm prolly gonna start reading the second one right away. It's called <i>Tribulation Force</i>. This series seems like it's really good. It's all about the rapture of the church, the prophecies, the rise of the antichrist and everything...global chaos...Muahahaha...*cough*
Yeah...good readin'.

Owwie...my foot hurts still...

What else...oh...I spilled 7-up all over my keyboard ten minutes ago...that sucked, cuz my computer is by my bed, and my keyboard was <i>on</i> my bed, and now a corner of my bed is all cold and wet and it's not cool.

Wow...I am rambling...laters y'all *thick souther accent*

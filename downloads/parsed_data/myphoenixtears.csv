from Stranger Inside by Shinedown:
So take while you can so you can meet demands
My insanity is what you thrive on
So rip it from my soul, so everyone will know in the end
We were never friends
Have you ever felt lost inside so unloved within that you almost died
Have you ever stepped out of the light and realized there's a stranger inside
Don't push your ignorance on me 
I'm not unrehearsed to your jealousy
And I know you think I don't see the signs
Well how do you know, do I look blind

from Feelin Way Too Damn Good by Nickelback:
And it's like 
Every time I turn around
I fall in love and find my heart face down and 
Where it lands is where it should
This time it's like
The two of us should probably start to fight
'Cause something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feeling way too damn good
Feelin' way too damn good

from Sanity by Bad Religion:
There's a watch in my pocket and its hands are broken
The face is blank but the gears are turning
Confusion is a fundamental state of mind
It doesn't really matter what I'm figuring out
I'm guaranteed to wind up in a state of doubt
And Sanity is a full time job
In a world that is always changing
And Sanity is a state of mind
And you believe in Sanity?
There's a shadow on the wall where the paint is peeling
My body's moving forward but my mind is reeling
Congression is a fundamental state of being
It doesn't really matter how my day has turned out
I always end up living in the world alone

from Anxiety by Bad Religion:
Anxiety for love of life
Anxiety for pain
Anxiety a feeling that you know you can't contain
(A fear that you have nothing more to gain)
Anxiety destroys us but it drives the common man
Foundation of society
Anxiety
Suppress it if you can
What are we angry for?
We all need a common cure
That common goal for which you strive
To have more than the other guy
The quest for truth 
The quest for gold
We end up all the same
The common lie
The righteous cry
We end up all the same
The angry crowd
Those lost and found
Everybody's all the same

from Silence by Blindside:
So I think I'll stay 
Caught up in a silent prayer
Cause I believe in silence
Our hearts speak the same word
So why don't we just walk along
The shoreline with our silent song
Cause I believe in Silence
Our hearts speak the same word

from Caught a Glimpse by Blindside:
(But in the crowd I) 
Caught a glimpse of your eye 
Everything freezes 
I'm in an old photograph 
I'm back from the start 
Caught a glimpse of your eye 
Everything freezes and I'm ready 
To give you my heart 

from March by Zao:
My strength, my strength fades 
My strength fades away 
Slowly with the setting sun 
The night brought its 
Darkness and its storms 
And the floods that came 
Reflected a dull moon 
Violent winds raged beneath the stars that didn't shine 
Emptied of myself I fell to the ground 
Slowly through the destruction 
Came a single quiet voice 
And the breath of His words consumed 
The night and brought strength I have never felt on my own 
And He held me up until I could walk again 
And promised to stay by my side forever

from 1 Corinthians 13 by Ace Troubleshooter:
What if I could move mountains
And gave all I had to the poor?
Would it mean a thing?
Would it mean a thing if I don't have love?
What if I used all the gifts
And gave my body to the flame?
Would it mean a thing?
Would it mean a thing if I don't have love?

Okay, that was long and kinda dumb...sorry."

I think I may have let my bad mood/sadness from yesterday affect how I reacted to somthing someone said. You know who you are. I'm sorry. Silence isn't always bad, I just couldn't think of anything to say. Um...talk to me later.

Why is everything falling apart? I don't know. I do know that at least one aspect of the badness/falling apartness/whatever could end up being good. We're going to re-form the band minus JT since he ""gave up on it"" or whatever. It'll be Me, Zack, Michelle, John, and maybe Chris. And it'll be FUN, you hear me?! FUN!!

Moving on...I have a job interview at the library tomorrow and I super super hope a lot that I'll get the job. That would be hella tight. I really did just say hella tight.

The trip was spiffy. I liked the place we stayed. There was nearly no light on the road, so stargazing ensued. It was awesome. I've discovered that I enjoy lying on the ground either for no reason or to just gaze in the sky. I like the sky. I want to live there one day...*shakes herself* Anyway, word association is fun. Especially at like 3 in the morning. We went tubing the next day (yesterday). It was SO COLD! That's why I'm sunburned. I felt like I was fighting for survival or something. We took some rather unorthodox measures to stay warm, but it was fun. Joscelyne and I didn't have to do anything. We just let Zack, Wayde, and Alton pull us around. THANKS GUYS! I love you guys. Facials for all on Saturday! lol! Yep, toward the end everyone, especially Zack, started getting really strange. We either got sun stroke or like, hypothermia. Everyone was pretty much dead on the way home.

Church was so cool last night. It was this new thing (for those of you who weren't there) where we go in a basically empty room and just whenever anyone feels like they should do or say something they do it. I thought about just getting up and spinning in circles, but I didn't. Then after it was over, I went outside and walked around cause it was SO nice yesterday. Then Michelle and Alton came out there with me and Michelle and I ran around in the grass until she had to leave. Then I just chilled in the grass with Alton till like 8:30. It was nice. I suggest finding a grassy area and just running around in it or laying in it. (is it laying or lying? I can never remember.) It's fun. Bring someone with you if you want. It's a nice way to talk to people. No distractions.

I finally got my Crutch cd today!!! It's so awesome! And not only did I get the cd and a big free sticker, but also...Dun diddly dUUUn...I got a hand written thank you note from the singer! Yippie! I felt so special even though he probably wrote one to everybody who ordered a cd. Oh well. They are cool guys. Writing thank you notes and whatnot. They know how to make a fan feel loved. By the way, if anyone knows anything about Aletheian coming to play a show down here, please tell me. I heard that it was going to happen, so I want to go if they do come.

X Trip today! I don't know where I'm going, but I'll be there till tomorrow evening."

Schizotypal Personality Disorder - individual is uncomfortable in close relationships, has thought or perceptual distortions, and peculiarities of behavior.

Histrionic Personality Disorder - individual often displays excessive emotionality and attention seeking in various contexts. They tend to overreact to other people, and are often perceived as shallow and self-centered.

Dependent Personality Disorder - individual shows an extreme need to be taken care of that leads to fears of separation, and passive and clinging behavior."

"event","Yay. My face hurt pretty bad when I woke up but it was okay after I got some meds in me. I've been up since 7:30. The paper they gave me said that the swelling would be the worst 42 to 78 hours after surgery but I don't think I've swollen anymore since yesterday. I could slap myself on the right side of my face and I'd be fine, but I can't even touch the left side. *shrugs* Whateva. It'll be ok in a day or two I suppose. I feel like a chipmunk. Big ole puffy cheeks and whatnot. Well I really didn't have anything to say at all. I hope I get to see people today. COME VISIT ME!"

"event","I have 4 less teeth than I did 12 hours ago. The dentist left the stitches on the top right kinda long and I can play with the ends with my tongue. The left side of my jaw is swollen and my whole mouth is sore but it's really not bad at all. I am now pumped full of antibiotics and lortabs. Yay. And I was full of all kinds of food you don't have to chew but I barfed it all up. It felt nice, actually. I kept the teeth. They're pretty nifty. I think I asked my mom the same question 3 times earlier. Whatever was in that iv made me lose short term memory. I also saw my teeth twice before I remembered seeing them. Yep, I slept half the day so now I'm not tired at all. I should be well enough to go out tomorrow if I want as long as I don't do anything strenuous. Wouldn't want to worsen my woozyness or barf again. I don't know what exactly I'd do if I went anywhere. Hmm. Maybe people could come over here. I don't know. I guess I'll have to wait and see if I'm up to it tomorrow. If anyone wants to come over I'm sure I won't mind. It'd be nice to see you people since I usually do on Mondays and didn't get to today. Well that's all for now. Bye!

"event","I'm not confused; I'm scared. Sometimes I forget that I'm the biggest weenie on Earth because I'm too busy pretending not to be. I hate letting people see me when I'm weak. I've only cried at school once ever and it was because I just got broken up with for no reason. I only cry in my room, alone. I won't even let my family know that I'm upset. I guess all this is probably bad for me in some way, but I don't really care. I like it this way. I'm like the guy in that movie I watched last night. He didn't want anyone to pity him (even though he was dying of bone cancer.)

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that my ""confusion"" lately has really been fear and that's harder to get rid of than confusion, unfortunately. I'm afraid of getting close to people. I'm afraid of making commitments. I'm just afraid. There. Now you know. Sorry.

I just want somebody

A body to hold

The thing is I care about eVeRyOnE. This fact also makes it difficult for ME to know what my real feelings for guys are. I'm never entirely sure whether I like them ""in that way"" or if I care about them like everyone else. Why didn't I realize this stuff before now? Crap. Will I ever find *that guy* that I'm supposed to be with? I mean, I can't even dicipher my own feelings. How can I share them with someone else when I don't really know what they are?

I thought it would never end!  Now I am posting this Tongue-Twisting result to dare you to take it.
Can you survive it?
That one was fun.

Take the quiz: <a href=""http://www.zenhex.com/quiz.php?id=383"">""What kind of girl are you?""<br></a><br><b>Mostly C's, You'r a Happy girl!</b><br>You are a happy girl. Not too happy that you get annoying, but happy enough that you have some friends. You like Christian music, but in your darker moods you don't mind darker music . You love to be alone at times. And you either listen to the tragic romance music, or just the rain. Usually during these times you daydream. You love daydreaming because you can do or be anything you want. Unlike life where it tells you what to be. But, despite that, you're still a happy person!
That was fairly accurate...

"event","I'm so tired. Those little kids at VBS are nuts. I'm never ever having kids. There was one girl who started crying because her friend didn't sit by her and she thought he didn't want to be her friend anymore. *sigh* I don't even want to hear her once she gets to high school...

Confusion/Contemplation
^emotions of the week^

I guess when you're confused you think about it a lot. I do anyway. Stupid...confusion. Stupid...emotions. BLAST. Everyone is happy and it makes me nauseous. Okay, everyone isn't happy, but lots of people are and it's gross. Darn happy people."

"event","This seems to be the time for people (or at least some of my friends) to question or abandon their faith. It's really sad to see. I hope they will at least make some kind of final decision. Hopefully that decision will still include God. I mean really, isn't it better to believe in something and find it to be false (like Hell) than to not believe in it and find it true? (again, like Hell) I mean really.

My ear hurts. I have a freaking zit in my freaking ear. Pain.

I still don't wanna go to VBS. I think I'll go sit in the corner with Zack like we were talking about earlier. Maybe play cards or something. That sure oughta be fun. I used ""oughta"" in a sentance. w00t.

Still need to go cash my measley check and go to the movies. Anyone who cares to join me at the movies is welcome."

I wish I could say I hate you all, but I don't lie. Damn morals."

"event","My blinds viciously attacked me yesterday. I've got 3 or 4 little cuts on my left index finger now. Stupid blinds. I knew I didn't want to clean them. 

AOL radio isn't working.

I made a skirt out of an old shirt yesterday. The only thing I have to do today until 4 (band practice) is to sew up a pocket on that thing. So I've got about 3 hours of boredom ahead of me today. Yippie.
It's a pretty cool skirt. The only sewing I had to do was to close up the pockets which used to be the sleeves. I've been feeling creative lately.

I saw Spiderman 2 last night. It was pretty darn cool. I want to see King Arthur. I also want to see Farenheit 9/11. If I have nothing to do and 7 bucks laying around I might go see Dodgeball and/or White Chicks."

Wackiness: 62/100
Rationality: 56/100
Constructiveness: 56/100
Leadership: 50/100 


You are a WRCF--Wacky Rational Constructive Follower. This makes you Paul Begala. You are unflappable and largely unconcerned with others' reactions to you. You were not particularly interested in the results of this test, and probably took it only as a result of someone else asking you to. 

You have a biting wit and intense powers of observation. No detail is lost on you, and your friends know it--relying on you to have the facts when others express only opinions. You are even-tempered, friendly, and educated. Foolish strangers may mistake your mildness for weakness--they will be surprised.

You entire approach to life is enviable. You will raise good kids."

"event","I just cleaned my room. Go me. I still need to dust my blinds. I'd rather lick a porcupine.

I took a little exam yesterday to become a library page if any libraries need one. That would be cool because I'd be paid above minimum wage. Not much, but still.

The right side of my neck and back is hurting AGAIN.

I need to read a lot of stuff before school and I don't wanna.

I decided not to date until I graduate. Not new news. Not big news. It's just that I thought it would be good and fun and easy but it isn't. I can't even like people because I'm horrible at hiding it and then people are like ""whoa she likes me"" and that's bad because I don't want to like anybody and I don't really want anyone to like me. I mean of course everybody wants attention and crap but in this case it's not good. I want the attention SO much but don't want to accept it but also don't want to be rude and ajdfkljdsaoifhlkdsah!!!!!!!!!! *becomes a hermit so she doesn't have to be around cute boys* Stupid cute boys."

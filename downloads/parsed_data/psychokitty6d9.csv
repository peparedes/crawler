By: AFI
Yoiu are thoroughly depressed. Something has got<br>you terribly upset and you cant think of<br>anything else to do but kill yourself... In<br>this case, it was by jumping off a bridge. You<br>are so consumed by it you forget about your<br>friends and how much this is hurting them. Your<br>friends will always stand by you- remember that<br>and the feeling will pass.
Your lyrics:
I...I came here by day, but I left here in darkness
And found you, found you on the way
And now, it is silver and silent, it is silver and<br>cold
You, in somber resplendence, I hold

Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one
Your sins into me
oh As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a<br>prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness
(Your sins into me) Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one

Light, like the flutter of wings, feel your hollow<br>voice rushing into me
As you're longing to sing
So I..I will paint you in silver, I will wrap you<br>in cold
I will lift up your voices as I sink

Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one, now
Your sins into me
oh As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a<br>prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness
(Your sins into me) Your sins into me

Cold in life's throws, I'll fall asleep for you
Cold in life's throws, I only ask you turn away
Cold in life's throws, I'll fall asleep for you
Cold in life's throws, I only ask you turn
As they seep... into me, oh, my beautiful one, now

Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one
Your sins into me
oh As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a<br>prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness
(Your sins into me)
Your sins into me... oh

Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one, now
Your sins into me
As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a<br>prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness
(Your sins into me) Your sins into...
(Your sins into me) Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one

well later on her mom came home and needed some help outside and she asked if we had seen all the food she bought so we went and looked and there was food piled on top of food and i was just like ""shit!"" and i didnt' realize it for a bit and her mom was just starin at me e lauged are ass's off about it and after that shit seemed to be the popular word for about an hourand thats about it l8rz ~~~~~@  Niqe"

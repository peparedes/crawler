<i>Well, that went better than expected..</i>

Dragon steps into the squalid hellhole that currently provides him shelter, closing and locking the door behind him. Slipping the shoes from his feet, he steps to the center of the sparsely-decorated apartment and kneels, closing his eyes.

<i>Shiva knows I'm alive. And while I can certainly count on her to keep mum on the subject, if <b>she</b> found out, that means others will find out as well. I may have to prepare for visitors.</i>

<lj-cut>He exhales, bringing his breathing into a rhythmic balance - his mind tracing over events of the past.

<i>O-Sensei taught me better than I realized. But when confronted by Shiva for the first time.. all revenge and dark energy.. that was a more revelatory experience than any of the lessons. It was a collision of worlds. Dark and light. Fire and ice. Yin and Yang.

It felt as though that she was necessary in the universe. As fate decreed there must be Richard Dragon, so too did it decree there would be Shiva. The same, yet opposite.

Once we get past the idea she'd been given, that I'd killed her sister, we were close. I tried to show her the spiritual side of the arts - the feeling side. But she'd been stunted, emotionally. I'm a creature of emotion and instinct - but I can learn discipline and control. Trying to learn it from the other side.. learning to feel.. that's harder. People say she has a killing instinct - but that's not what it is. I'm an instinctual fighter. What she does? That's reflex. Looks the same. Fights the same. Worlds of difference inside.</i>

He stands, eyes still closed, rehearsing one of his many katas.

<i>And then I made my first mistake. Ben got brainwashed by the League of Assassins. I disappeared. Shiva.. got lost. If I'd stayed.. would she be where she is today? Or would we have killed each other? Cutting myself loose from Shiva and Ben was like cutting off my own arms. Hiding didn't solve anything.

I felt out of balance, then. I took on students, trying to fill that void. The students - mostly would-be vigilantes. People of solid moral character. More positive chi. Found some sense of balance in illegal pit-fights. Brutal. Harsh. Filled with the lowest scum imaginable. Negative chi. Helped to balance things. For a while. Then I died. That was, in some ways, more revelatory than my first encounter with Shiva. Meeting her made me understand myself. Dying let me understand the universe. That last little shred of mortal fear that even the bravest cling to - that's gone. But the death that finally opened my eyes.. that may have done more damage to Shiva. Is that balance? One of us healed, the other broken?</i>

He leaps blindly, finding a balanced perch on the arm of the threadbare couch nearby, transitioning into another of his katas.

<i>I'd love to undo her damage. To fix her. But we're opposites. I've found my internal balance, for the most part. But I can't help her. Maybe.. just maybe.. Vic Sage can. There was a positive spark or two in Shiva. Maybe Vic can fan that spark into fire.</i>

"event","An alleyway in New York.

A red-haired man, hands shoved in the pockets of his dingy jacket, wanders down an alleyway, taking a shortcut on his way to the apartment he currently calls home.

Peeling themselves from the shadows of the alleyway, three street-toughs advance with a menacing air, brandishing improvised weapons.

Dragon glances at the figures confronting him, eyes flicking across them to take note of their stance, their weapons.. a chain.. a knife.. a pipe.

""Look, fellas. I'm not looking for trouble.""

<i>Here it comes. ""But trouble's found you.""</i>

The thin thug, who appears smart enough to have two braincells to rub together, responds. ""Oh, yeah? Well, trouble's found you.""

<i>Ugh. The worst thing about these little encounters has to be the dialogue. </i>

""Guys, you're really barking up the wrong tree. I'm broke.""

The heavier one on the left responds this time. ""Yeah, cause we're gonna break you!""

<i>Allright, that's enough. </i>

""Last chance, boys.""

The three laugh and whoop as they charge forward, swinging the weapons without any sort of technique at all. Dragon springs to the right, hands still pocketed, delivering a hard kick to a trashcan, sending it hurtling on its side at the feet of the oncoming assailants. Two of them trip up, leaving the one on the left, still hurtling onward like a rhinocerous.

With a fluid motion, Richard slides his jacket from his shoulders, one hand grabbing a freed sleeve, wielding the beaten windbreaker almost like a whip.

The thug pauses to consider the situation, to his credit. Then laughs at the sight. Barely one chuckle has time to escape his throat before the jacket lashes out, the loose sleeve wrapping around his throat tightly.

The Dragon smiles. The mugger's eyes widen as he gasps for air. There's a swift, forceful tug, and the thug comes hurtling towards the master martial artist, who frees him from the grip of the sleeve with a bone-crunching punch.

The other pair are just regaining their feet, in time to see their associate disabled so quickly.

""Is this the part where I say 'Come Get Some'? Or 'Who wants more'?""

They glance at each other in a wordless panic, and run frantically away down the alley.

Richard Dragon slips his coat back onto his shoulders, and continues on his way home."

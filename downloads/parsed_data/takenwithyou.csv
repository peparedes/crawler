Friday night I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head
Well looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind
I've been a fool
To ever open up my heart
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule

Saturday I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing
Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream
Only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To tell you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

If you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now

Babylon, Babylon

Sunday all the lights of London
Shining , Sky is fading red to blue
I'm kicking through the Autumn leaves
And wondering where it is you might be going to
Turning back for home
You know I'm feeling so alone
I can't believe
Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me


If you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now

Babylon, Babylon, Babylon"

everytime i come home i think it'll be different and its okay, things will change. nothing changes. aside from my wonderful bf, who by the way, if i intend to sleep over with, i have to marry, according to my step whatever he is, and my mom who sometimes agrees with him and does NOTHING to help the situation, case in point tonight, i love brockport. no one understands why i like it there so much. then again no one has my family. i dont like being called names and feeling like im walking on eggshells and nothing is good enough and everythings my fault, especially things that i dont control. dont yell at me because my dad wont pay you, thats not my thing, take it up with him.

i hate it here and i can not wait to go back. happiness is located in Brockport, where i have awesome friends, a best friend who happens to be my roomie and a place that i call home because its more of a home over there than any place in dansville. the only thing i need up there now would be Jimmy. after that, im never coming back, count on it."

ahh Christmas.. the time of year i loathe. i never really much liked christmas, i mean it is a nice time of the year, but im not into the whole decorating, christmas music, chopping down trees thing. cookies are cool.. only because this year we get to include Kenzer.. the spawn of satan. no its cool.. shes a cute one, most of the time. 

Lori knows what i got Lauren and Jess. Jess knows what i got Lori and Lauren. Lauren knows what i got Lori and Jess. they could easily find out what they're getting from me.. but im trusting them. im not too good with the whole hiding what im getting you until christmas when you open the present thing. idk.. i just want to know if they like it.. so i dont have to hear ""oh.. its nice.."" that kinda sucks. i gave jimmy one of his presents before thanksgiving.. im not a patient person. 

so Carly ran away.

her collar doesnt work anymore, we need to get a new battery. this made me worried because Carly, unlike the typical dog, runs towards cars. anyways, my grandpa, being the wonderful person that he is, reported Carly to the police, what she looked like, shes a coward, that kind of thing. around 5:30 my family got a phone call saying that they found her. apparently, a garage door was open on Sophia street, and there were kids playing in the garage, Carly saw them and decided to go play with them! they werent scared, took about 10 minutes before the dad came out and saw his kids playing with my dog, called the police. Needless to say, my dog came home in the back of a cop car. how fetch is that?

it was times like tonight when it just kind of hits you, your in college. when you move on from eating dinner with your friends in Burger King, to sitting down and eating with your friends in Fridays or Olive Garden or something along those lines, you realize your not so little anymore. its kind of scary in a way, but you have to embrace it sometime..

im alone and bored, with no one to talk to. 


home tomorrow.. see you then :0)

friday dime a dance was cool.. cant wait for tap to begin, got to see our future teacher, Adrienne Poole. she looks like a crazy one. yay for Jaimi, Brittany and Tara!! and anyone else who i know whos in it.. maybe jo.. not sure.

saturday was the gig night, NICE!! lol even though they get all confused and dont know what song to play next, its okay! and even though Sean likes to show the crowd his private parts while they play, its okay! i love when the drummer gets frustrated and throws his sticks.. lol thats lovely!! love you sweetie lol. i cant believe i saw Mark Wittmeyer.. hes been in Iraq! thats craziness.. of course i HAD to call Lauren and tell her!! lol fun times. Revelation of mine, not all girls are out to get my boyfriend. lol or at least not the one i was weary of. not even really weary of, persay, just not cool with. i know they didnt want each other.. i just have issues. but shes cool!! it turns out we have the same sense of humor and sarcastic tone, learn it, live it, love it. anytime.. AND she asked me to go clubbing with her in the city sometime so thats cool. good day. Jimmys cousin DJ came down and he was all ghetto'd out, thats always funny. fun times that night, i was going to get drunk but was too tired to even sit up, so that didnt go. i feel the need for a certain Josh Kelley lyric inserted here: ""I love the faces you make at me, when we're lyin in bed. They're always so beautiful."" lol oh yes.. tons of fun. lol still sorry.. i didnt mean to share THAT with you, lol but your words were very comforting and i love you for saying them. very muchly!! :0)

sunday was strange, cant even really remember it.. i know i was supposed to make cookies but that didnt go either.. nice.

monday was lovely.. monday night anyways! i love how we cuddle and pretend to watch movies, and then you fall asleep. its my favorite thing lol. he was really funny though, you should have stayed awake. ""Dont try to be a comeedddiaann... comediannan."" lol histerical. eh.. the night was okay, got better during the morning. didnt want to leave :0( but alas! i had to return to Bport.

so here i am.. trying to remember all the details of the weekend to keep the few people that actually read this, updated. or, for my own benefit because we all know that i have the best memory in the world.. yeaaaaahh.

well.. yesterday was okay. Dime a Dance was awesome, unbelievable. I wish i could ""Work It Out"" like Busta, Abbey and Monday.. thats craziness. might be goin again tonight, to see the irish and traditional tap pieces.. exciting.

this day has already taken a turn for the worse, not to thrilled about it. i was semi happy when i woke up, and its gone, just like that.

i wish i had a car or lots of money or something.. i just wished he lived closer. i wish they had never split.. he gets rich and i get stuck with the step dad from hell? not fair.. not fair at all. Life's not fair Jaimi, get over it. Or Life goes on.. i hate that saying. it doesnt do anything but state the obvious. i'll just have to see him sometime next year, thats all. not like this hasnt happened before.. but why is it bothering me so much this time? there was so much i had planned and wanted to do.. just wanted to see you. i guess i always knew this would happen, i just didnt want to believe it. you even told me a couple of times, but i took the optimistic route.. which is insane because im anything but optimistic. now i just have to call and explain.. i cant do this..

Friday, friday i went to Alfred to see my Lori, Lauren and Jess. YAY!! i finally meet this Nate person who is stealing away my Lauren.. grr. its okay, they're cute together. ""Get away from me."" ""I like you Lauren."" lol its a nice relationship. then Lauren and Jess and Nate leave and Lori and i are just left.. hangin out. then with some creative thinking, she calls her friend Keith.. eww.. no. so that was fun. Boris drops by to join the fun, then Jess comes back and we all go to GJs. Meghan and Sara come down too, and we meet Mallory there. It gets really crowded and i dont feel like having random guys try to dance with me all the time, so Jess and I leave. We make the chilly walk home, but not before Jess gets hit on, right out of the club. lol she loved it.. ""wanna watch a movie?"" way to go Jess! so we walk home, and then pretty soon Lori comes on home and we all chill for a while and then go to bed. but not before Lori and i make a trip through the maze that is Alfred, to the vending machines!! had my brockport gear on, ""Hey you go to Brockport!?"" yay!! first time thats happened. Leigh, Brice says hi. then we go back up and go to bed :0) and Jess takes me home in the morning, but before we leave we have a lovely conversation with Lauren, via window out to the parking lot. home i go.

Saturday, i get all my gear around and Jimmy comes to pick me up :0) makes me happy!! we get to his house and he shows me his new room, proudly, with a dresser for his clothes and even a bed!! of course, bubba is loving the PS2 and TV in his room, what a big brother! then he becomes sleepy and his back hurts so, i suggest massage.. that last all of 2 minutes and he was asleep lol its okay though, i kept going. cover him up, take a little nap with him for about an hour because i am very tired also. then his favorite person comes home, suddenly might i add. so he plays GTA:San Andreas.. i think thats what it is. trys to get me to play a few times, has to leave, so i finally give in. not bad. running people down with different cars and steering through the streets.. fun times. personally, i like the bike. then its time for some family fun. him, rachel, bubbba, dani and marilyn all decide to play some game where you take something and throw it and whatever it hits, you cant use.. not sure. Jake and i pretend to hide from them.. fun times lol. (side note: my fish is once again being suicidal. burrying himself under the rocks in his bowl, how lovely.) then we decide to play charades. of course i knew the answers, but if you guess them right, you have to go next. then a little truth or dare. i felt kind of bad making his little sister run around outside in the snow with no shoes.. but she picked dare and i couldnt think of anything. the truth part got a little strange, coughJIMMYcough, not taking it personally though. oh well. so then he plays a little counterstrike, for maybe an hour and a half or something, maybe less.. and i watch. not the most exciting thing in the world, but at least i was with him :0) that makes me happy too. then downstairs to watch a little tv, some face fights, you still owe me like 21, some proposels.. i got turned down lol but thats okay. then sleep on a small little couch that i dont like, but we were together so it didnt really matter. falling asleep to a war movie.. gotta love it.

over all.. my weekend was awesome. i feel as though we're getting back to the fun stage or the comfortable stage, either or. i can only hope the feeling is being returned on the other side.. i hope i hope i hope. miss you.. :0(

OMG! so. im definitely registered for classes that i didnt sign up for.. where did Sociology come from? i didnt even put it as a back up!! im not registered for the one class i was excited for..

brittany and i went out and purchased 9 rolls of wrapping paper to do our walls in our common room.. if there were a ROOM contest, we would win. however, there is a door contest now, and our door is so decked out, we're a sure bet :0) anyways. that was fun. then some KFC, how nice. love my roomie.

So i havent gone to history for like 3 times in a row and i decide to go the last day before break.. i get there.. in a class of maybe 50 students there is 20 of us who have showed. so.. she counts us up, passes around a sheet of paper and we all sign. she tells us that all of us who have just signed the paper will recieve 2 extra points on our final.. uhh, YEAH!! didnt really used to be that fond of Wanda.. but shes starting to seem less boring.. well.. shes still extremely boring but shes a little cooler now, in my book anyway.

the community service thing for Dance Team was fun. Britt, Lindsay and I rockin it out lol. now that we've moved up to the front, the captains suddenly like us.. its crazy. lol Lindsay liked us before but now even more.. apparently. ""See, its not just me. The whole team is crazy."" (as i dance in front of the visitors who have come to tour Brockport Campus) yes.. thats right Ladies and Gents, i was a greeter and door holder for the new coming freshmen visitors.. how fetch is that? didnt see any dansvillians.. thats okay though, its my college, not theirs!! ""evil laugh"". excited about our new apparel.. yay!! not allowed to wear anything if we go out though.. dont want to get a bad reputation for the team, that would be bad.

how awesome is my boyfriend do you ask? very awesome. wasnt going to stay but then he did, because i was sick from the sickness that he had, so he stayed to take care of me. i thought it was nice.. and he was kinda sleepy.. not safe to drive home, especially with no CD Player or any form of entertainment. Hopefully i'll get to see him tomorrow/hang out.. whatever. Thanksgiving with his family, his big ITALIAN family, yeah.. kinda scared. lol guess i'll have to act like a nice girl, that sucks.

In the darkness of the window,
I can hardly get to sleep.
Wish for the hour that,
That night time soon shall pass.
And the morning dew will bring us,
To a day our souls can last.

Love has a reason,
There's a meaning to the world
We're giving love.

Situation, candlelight.
Enough to see the bits around you,
But it's never very bright.
Stare at a memory,
You, through the grapevine, heard the truth.
It's good to learn from your mistakes,
But that only works in youth.

Love has a reason.
There's a meaning to the world, 
We're giving love.

Restless minds, curtain calls follow fanfares.
Troubled hearts, just a walk down the hall.
Restless hearts, you take a punch just to land one.
Troubled minds, it's only fair after all.

Mountin, the trail, but you've got it in sight
Sometimes the only way is jumping
I hope you're not afraid of heights
Reach in my pocket for a bill that isn't there
And to face all of the undoings
Still isn't more than I can bear

Love has a reason
There's a meaning to the world
We're giving love
Giving love
Love, love
It's always been good to me
It's always been good to me
Love has reason
There's a meaning to the world
We're giving love..

Happy Birthday to my buddy Nikkie that night, my present? drinking for the first time for her birthday, nice, right?

SATURDAY: awesome. went on home, awkward ride home but i got there. thank you, very much. anyways.. so. got there and saw Kenz, hell child. Lori gave me a ring and that night we ended up drivin on over to Alfred. They're room is nice, i like it. although their building is like a maze with 500 different doors. Met some new people: Rob, Boris, Rob, Brian, Pat, Nate, Alex and i think thats it. they're pretty cool. i have to say that Pat would have to be the funniest when he is drunk. ""See now you're lying.

Then again it could have been anyone, soo packed. could barely move, let alone dance. and when you tried to dance people would try to dance on you, not cool. but thats what the guys were for, they would just go up and get the other guys to go away lol. then Lori, stupid buttface, took a drink out of Pats whatever it was and she definitely got spotted and kicked out lol. ""Your outta here!!"" fat man.. douchebag. later that night.. yes.. we all needed somewhere to sleep. luckily i got Laurens other bed.. fun times man, fun times. let me tell you! no, i wont. end saturday night.

sunday was a little more difficult. got back to my house around 3ish and then everyone got in the shower before i did, which i did not appreciate!! that was definitely MY DAY and it wasnt turning into my day at all. well.. dinner was cool. Pizza Hut and cherry/pumpkin pie :0) makes me happy. then later that night, things were looking grim for the boy and I but he came through, as always :0) also makes me happy. went and stayed the night with him, lots of happiness there. didnt want it to end.. really didnt wanna come back here but i had to. Thank you for walking me home.. i miss you already :0( doesnt make me happy. hopefully i'll see you this coming weekend. 

thats all for now. love you, miss you.

"event","i guess no news is good news in regards to lj for me. have had heaps going on- and mostly all good. have finished sex work for ever :) go me!! got $ sorted out to manage on my student part-time job wages and green-eyed boy and i are planning our collaring ceremony. have finished semester one at uni also and passed all my subjects (pretty darn good considering the number of hours i worked last semester) and all the cats are happy and healthy... ok, inky stressed out with GIB's latest visit, but he is recovering now.
funny reading back through prior entries... no trip to vietnam this june, but chopped my debt in half and am happy to celebrate that achievement at home instead. may increase entries to more than twice a year, but will see how we go- not promising anything."

"event","Has been ages since I have written due to a number of factors.. does anybody read this apart from me?; there is something satisfying about a pen and (paper) notebook a laptop and blank screen can never match; and events have been too controversial (or so i thought at the time) to be noted on a web blog.

So to refresh and recap. Have finished uni for the year. Despite the great start to the semester, lack of planning kicked in and only completed one of the two subjects I commenced. I aced it btw, tho- so not too down on myself- just looking forward to next year and putting into effect the time management and study skills i have learnt (the hard way) this year.

The 'beautiful man' I referred to in the last entry turned out to be a right bastard- complete with wife/partner of five years waiting for him at the other end of the flight I went to see him off at. Needless to say, ciao!

Work has been (or rather, was) stressful till bout 5 weeks ago. We were having major problems with the landlord-cum-illegal-owner of the parlour I was working and I have since a) filed a report with Consumer Affairs about his conduct, and b) left. Both turned out to be really healthy for my brain and soul, and am much happier where I am working now. 

Have been seeing a new man, and can honestly say this time I am really happy. I spent 3 months in 'alone' time post Bryce, which did the trick of rejuvenating my spirit and letting the pain of betrayal go (a few loud and agressive cursing sessions may have assisted too):) Have entered this new relationship with a much clearer head and close to zero hang-ups. I did have a crisis of conscience early on re my desire for women, but after a few hours thought, 'Fuck it, it feels good. I don't have to justify my feelings to myself' and have felt fine since.

It is going great with green-eyed boy. Have a ridiculous number of things in common, or shared ideologies, and never stop talking. Funny how I always pick the ones who live/work 1000kms away. He is coming back down bout 6th December, and I'm flying up for new year's eve. Have plans for Jan worked out already (Big Day Out!) and bouncing ideas around for June, or whenever I have uni hols to go to Vietnam and tour it via bike ride. Have met his parents and passed (yay!) and he'll hopefully meet mum and dad in dec. Has been a whirlwind ride, and am excitedly looking forward to the rest of it. Have finally and unexpectedly met my match in many ways. Not really even crossing fingers, 'cos it just fits;)

Congrats to Whed on the new job- fantastic!
Take care all"

"event","started back at uni and is going really well- have attended all but one class this semester (same time last semester had attended one class, period). starting to feel more like a real uni student.
have been seeing a new man, bryce, and it is going really well- beautiful man... saw him off at the airport yesterday, and altho it hurt to see him go, was great to see him one last time before he left. will be looking at taking a few weeks holiday in queensland in september to see him."

"event","well things were decided for me in regard to terry- no go... i totally understand his reasons. i am upset that it didn't work out- why should we meet if we cannot take the connection and run with it- whose lesson was this meant to be? i s'pos both- his in figuring out his priorities, and learning that what he craves is out there- but he has to be selfish and leave his comfort zone to hold onto it... and my lesson is probably to learn to give and let go- to be less selfish and more open to giving> to not receive anything back for whatever love and care i can give him. which in itself, is false, because by giving me the opportunity to share that love and know it has been accepted, i have received something in return. i am happy that we did connect with each other, and i am not sorry for anything that happened... just wish i could keep on sharing that love and spoiling him. 
it's helped me to let go of needing to find someone just yet tho- i need a real connection with whoever i am with- not just sex and 'how was your day', but romance and 'how is your soul'."

"event","as always, been thinking bout what i am doing, and if it fits into where i want to be at this point in time... am i realising any goals, or am i being more destructive than con?

finished 'emergency sex' the other night- really emotive book cos of the events and circumstances it describes, and affected me more cos it describes what i want to do with my life- what i want to get out and experience and achieve. don't think i want to be a nurse with the UN, but with an aid agency who deal with war and trauma first-hand. it makes me more determined to get my debt paid off and focus on school so i can get out and start practising asap.  have a really good budget worked out, so that part of it is under-way, and semester two starts in a month...

evolution of the soul

my soul screams for the pain of reality
the tears of pure living
to be in situations which have nothing to do with money
to leave material possessions and luxuries behind
to escape the pressure of keeping pace with too busy people
and embrace the thrill of earning my ability to survive

wrote this while reading the book. have a new goal cos of it- gonna erase debt first, then save to go with international volunteers australia o/s at the summer break- get a taste of what i'll be in for, and help someone now- keep me motivated to finish my degree.

another thing that got me really upset was work last night- wasn't in the best mood for it, cos of the financial stress, and need a break, but due to the first, can't do the second... had a client that i really didn't get along with, but then he rang and complained.. that brought me down a bit, but the next client i had is in the army, and i got really upset when i saw him... upset cos he is going to iraq, upset cos he had to come to a prostitute to get a cuddle and have a cry, upset cos both he and i (in our respective roles- he as a man, and as a soldier, me as a pro) are expected to not show emotion- to 'keep it together', to be stoic and be 'better' than to cry and show and experience pain and fear... what de-humanising expectations society places on us :( 

been thinking heaps bout seeing terry- whether or not i should for a start- he is still married, no matter how bad it is- thats the fact... dont know whether i should follow the feelings i have for him, or (what used to be) my morals... my belief about being true to yourself and fulfilling souls is much higher a moral than monogamy for me. i dont know.

i know i have been especially lonely recently- it has been over a year since i have woken up with someone i love next to me on a regualr basis. i am aching to share my love of life and intimacy with someone, and can't help wondering if subconsciously that is why i am so determined not to let terry go- if i let him go, how long will it be till i fall for anyone else? is it a genuine love, or is it just a mask to escape my loneliness? what loaded questions to chance another person's happiness/ realtionship with me on... and as much as i try not to think about it, i do need women in my life- apart from cass the only people who truly know and love me (and let's be honest, i even have any interaction with) are men. something's gotta give.

 
love to all"

"event","the soft beat of portishead in the background
rocks your body to the beat of mine
as we enter a space
no-one else can create
a space that started with a kiss
i thought would be my death
the pull and push for contact
the energy you demanded i provide
as you sucked my every breath from my lungs
leaving me gasping for it back
only able to receive it again from your mouth
a kiss that melted my thighs
and stole my sense of control
as i gathered your body under mine
and lay you down silently
resting my knee between your thighs
and breaking contact only long enough 
for us to remove each other's clothing
(at last, your skin!)
and for me to marvel at the beauty of you
before gently taking one breast
then the other
with both hands, teeth and tongue
softly kissing, teasing, prodding
each into attention
savouring not only the connection made
between tissue and tongue
but the heart i love that lay beyond
diving slowly into the folds of your skin
each layer opening with recognition of my touch
warmth pouring from my hands
as they connect with your skin
and matching your breathing
as you carry me in"

"event","so sorry i am to deceive you
how can i mistreat my own heart
my soul yearns for something, i know
but it is not a man's gentle touch
i ache with longing for a woman
to be her 'angel' and wake to her embrace
how easy it is to believe i can ignore this call
when i feel your arms around me
it hurts so much to place restrictions
on those who bless me with passion and love
but something inside is never complete
without another female's energy to relate
so many times have i heard your voice
and thought this love is only for you
that you are an exception, not the rule
and that men will be worthy and compensate
but how cruel it is to deny them my full self
when they could be experiecing it all
with another woman who has not the same pains
not the same aches for a soft feminine soul
it is with a heavy heart i deliver this word
i never thought it would control me to this point
but my own heart's desire cannot be ignored
and you deserve more than 'we'll see' or 'for now'
so i pray you find your angel out there
may we both sleep well at night
precious times are ahead for both of us
with our fair ladies that hold us tight"

"event","dear diary or whomever reads this,

i feel like i'm back on board the freight train of life- i dropped out a bit when i was so energy-poor that i couldnt even get out of bed, but i'm back to wanting to take the most from my part in life and give back to all who cross my path...

been in turmoil about coming out again- this time as a pro. i am so hungry to be truthful to those around me. i am tired of lying to save other people's disomfort, and our relationship that was before i started being true to myself. i'm scared about telling my parents most, because the most imprtant people in my life, the ones who brought me here, and taught me to be independent and stand up for who i am, may not be part of my life post-confession... i pray not, but i know it is a chance i am taking.

lots of thought to go into that of course, but on the up-side, am challenging myself to express what i am feeling as i feel it, especially when it is deep, raw emotion. help myself fully engage in myself and my world. i know this probably sounds wishy-washy, but i know i will get and give even more when i am open and present in every moment, and open to every opportunity...

such as taking a client up on meeting outside work- i had a great connection with this one... he has the greatest appreciation and need for intimacy, romance and passion. it is early days yet, and he has a lot to consider - my work, his son, his ex wife... will see what we can achieve.

sweet dreams to all"

"event","starting to 'get my shit together' as the saying goes...
seeing a counsellor at uni- teaching myself to take better care of myself. am sleeping heaps more -16 hours today, but am starting to accept that as part of the healing process... it has taken so long to learn from over-doing it that there is no such thing as under-doing it if you are still content with your part in life.
its incredible the learning and healing curve i've been on recently. am still going, but amazing to look back on a month and see how much change and learning has occured. only the other day realised what a good dose of writing can accomplish rather than ear-bashing someone.
have met some incredible people too- just by opening ourselves- our true selves- up to the experience of new ideas, experiences and energy, have been truly blessed by the interaction.
cass, as always, keeps on challenging me with her perceptions of and interactions with the world. she doesn't even realise it, but the unabashedness that she has about expressing to other people how she feels, and how beautiful they are makes people, including me, really uncomfortable... it's a sad state that we are in that we feel so uncertain of genuine kindness and love. but it challenges me to rise to that inner level of truth myself... not just in what i do with my time (ie work and play), but the depth which i experience those 'whats' and how much truth is in them.

incredible- just when you REALLY get comfortable with the idea of going to bed alone, with only the cats (and once in a while your best mate) to snuggle with, you meet someone.

not that i'm complaining (really)- it's great- i'd forgotten just how magical it is to be really excited about seeing and touching someone, and how much mental torture i can put myself through thinking bout the 'what if's'... grr, it's not too much to ask people to be upfront about where you -and they- stand, in regards to relationships is it?

i feel so stupid getting this anxious - i'd hope i'd done this enough now that i could just walk up to her, say 'i like u', then do the whole romance and dating thing.. i'd love to!

trouble is sex gets in the way, and you can never know where the other person is coming from.

i s'pos if it were easy, we'd all get it right the 1st time and second chances wouldn't happen.

as difficult as it was to say goodbye to ross, it was cathartic.

i'm scared shitless- how little time there is to learn, retain, and recycle everything i need to know to become a successful nurse.. and how much i know it's exactly the right thing to do right now, which is why i want to do so well...

just when i think i've got everything sorted out and i'm looking forward to whatever i intend to do next, as a single woman with little responsibility for other people's state of mind, i hear from ross.
yes, ross... 
the gorgeous man who left my life (or so i thought) 8 months ago, never to return. until now. 2 & 1/2 hours talking non-stop on the phone said to me that a connection definately still exists... what a wonderful thing, with shitty timing.
he has managed to sort out most (or all) of the shit he was wallowing in when we were together. i am so happy and proud for him, and am rapt that he has contacted me again to enjoy the happiness he has achieved.
what next? we spoke about how women have 70% more brain activity than men- of course, mine is now going 100 miles an hour trying to figure out what next...
i am open to anything, and would happily reunite- even with the distance... the love is still there, and hopefully now able to be received...
but work- i had to think long and hard about this one- it is something i need to do for myself- not for anyone else, and have come to the conclusion that i will still work- even if we do reunite, until i have achieved a set financial goal. then work stops. i hope this is enough for him- because it is the most i can offer at this point in time.
incredible...

"event","ok micheal, 
given i'm fast being persuaded of the exciting things the internet has to offer, and finding your live journal so interesting to read, i am going to give this a shot myself..

this is a piece i wrote when having a bad night at work..

There must be something better than this-
The everyday meaningless garbing 
between a slave of the system and its abusers
Why are all men created unequal?
There is so much misfortune in class
The government we have re-elected
continues to destroy it's own people's freedoms
We are supposed to be the lucky country
(well, we can shit and drink clean water)
but so many of it's people's basic financial and psychological
needs are far from being met
Consumerism has swallowed better judgment whole
and spits out debt and credit interest rate increases
to keep us from paying the rent
Magazines ""sold"" free in the only independent newspaper,
full of ads which hide the news
(a bottle of brandy is more important
than the war we waged with another country
to gain the free trade agreement that allows us to import it)
display large articles illustrating the new 'uppers',
the 'successful' people in their 'beautiful' homes, 
which we will never afford
despite working the expected nine till five a.m. shifts
that cater for the successful's to do their shopping
out of ordinary hours
The ones who groan inwardly on approaching the register
and then 'sympathetically' remark
that it must be horrible to be inside on a day like this
and wonder why I don't smile
In this society, I expect to receive more return
from the sale of my books to a second-hand bookstore
than I do from their content
which i am too busy working to consume...


...this is my starting point- which i am going to grow away from (as fast as possible)

love you all"

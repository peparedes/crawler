thank you for the search party; we just weren't ready to be found

who knew the heights could have such vast depths?
who knew that my veins would dry up this quick?
so afraid, yet secure with every single breath of our battered hearts

"event","<font size=""-2""><b>on friends</b>: I take on as many friends as I can handle because I love meeting new people and finding out about their lives. I love to hang out with anyone, but rarely make significant investments into just a few people at a time. My best friend sleeps in my bed with me.

<b>on God</b>: I am not ashamed to admit that I am a hypocrite for Christ. I know what kind of person I want to be but I fall short a lot. What most people don't understand is that my shortcomings do not make less of a Christian. In fact, it is those shortcomings that increase my need for grace and Christianity itself. I got over the judgmental phase a while ago, so feel free to ask me any questions.

<b>on music</b>: I used to run with the big dawgs. I used to put too much of my identity in music. I used to spend every waking moment composing songs in my head and playing drums on my desk at school. The whole experience for me was about getting into the lives of a lot of people and that definitely happened. No regrets with walking away from it. I have a million friendships because of it.

<b>on marriage</b>: There is absolutely nothing else i enjoy more in life. It is so hard to explain how nice it is to have a best friend do everything with me.

<b>on family</b>: I have been blessed regarding family. My family disbursed a while agi but I still have my mom and dad. i have been really lucky to have Megan's family in my life for the past 9 years. I feel like I grew up with them. I don't think they realize how awesome of a family they have been to me and how cool it is to have three sisters the same age with string faiths. They have all, especially Jacob, made me feel like a brother to them.</font>"

its true...

i was 16 when i met the girl i will fall asleep next to and wake up to until i die.  it is true that we held hands about 9 years ago and never stopped being in love.  i was never really all that great to her, but she stuck around.  and for that, i am excited to be the best husband around

its true...

i used to be into music a lot, but i might have sacrificed the possibility of making it a full time gig by going away to CMU for 5 years and getting a degree.  i decided i would like to put myself in a position to provide for someone when the time was right.  i had the time of my life and it took getting out of the heights to find who i was and what i wanted to do with my life

its true...

i am so far from any regret.  i would not trade my current life for a life of touring if it meant not having the life i have with megan.  10,000 screaming fans don't compare to dancing in the bathroom in the morning while brushing your teeth and trying to sing at the same time.  with megan, i feel like i can't hit a wrong note

its true...

i am blessed beyond comprehension</center>"

i have gotten caught up in the same cycle.  i have been buying a new cd every week <b>with hopes of hearing something fresh</b> that gets me to actually take an old cd out of my car.  it all sounds the same to me.  it all sounds <font size=""+1""><u>weak</u></font> to me.  i keep telling myself that the next cd i buy will be THE ONE.

i have always been one to get defensive of new music and tell everyone the need to open their ears to a new song.  i have always been a <b>believer</b> that music isn't dead and <i>we are all just jaded</i>.

<div style=""text-align: right;"">i might be changing my mind</div>

i might agree that as the type of music i once enjoyed has a chance to become mainstream, the bands are overproducing themselves and sacrificing some originality.  if i hear one more vocalist trying to sound exactly like taking back sunday i am going to switch to folk music 100%.

<font size=""+1"">Assignment</font> - <font color=""#800000"">I need to hear something <u>original</u>.  I need to hear a band that doesn't sound like ""a mixture of 'punk band a' and 'punk band b'"".  i need to hear the reason to keep buying albums.  i am a sucker for poetry and a good melody.  I know bands can be generic and still be really good.  I love a lot of them.  I just would rather listen to JEW's 'Clarity"", ""Tell All Your Friends"", The Used's self titled, etc. than the ""next big thing"".</font>

 <u>hard times</u>
- summer is here.  for the youngens out there, summer is the best time of the year.  for many upperclassmen that live away at college, this is easily the hardest part of the year.  neighbors, friends, and roomates are all back in their small towns across the country now.  i have another journal to go into detail about this.
- megan has graduated and moved home for the summer.  if one more person says ""but your going to have the rest of your lives together"" i will kick them in the jaw.  ive  lived next door to her for a whole year, seeing her 8 times a day.  these four months are going to be extremely hard.  she is my best friend and no one can comfort me like she can.

<u>great times</u>
- i am not extremely down at all though.  i get to go home for this next week and see all of my favorite people.  if you are anywhere around detroit, keep my cell phone ringing because i do not think i am even going to sleep for the whole week.  i allready have so much planned with everyone, so im pretty sure every night is going to be rediculous.thank you everyone that has allready called in anticipation.  lets get a keg of diet pepsi/bebsi and dance the night away.
- im getting together with a group of guys to play some music tomorrow.  while i won't disclose who they are, i will tell you i am crazy excited to grab a mic again
- meg and i get to meet up with everyone for some pistons basketball.  she can actually get into the sports bars this year!
- my roomates up here at central are amazing.  we wont have 12 people over every single night in the summer, but we will definately find things to do.  i cant wait to take up frisbee golf again.

<b>TRUE:</b> FROM HERE ON OUT IS IN THE PROCESS OF BOOKING THEIR LAST TWO SHOWS!! (DEC/JAN)
<b>TRUE:</b> IT INVOLVES A REUNION OF THE ORIGINAL BASED ON A TRUE STORY (DANNY, TONY, CAM, JAY, MARIO)
<b>TRUE:</b> IT MIGHT INVOLVE A REUNION OF THE ORIGINAL NOBODY SPECIAL (BRAD, ERIK, RJ, JIM, NARDI)
<b>RUMOR:</b> IT MIGHT INVOLVE MORE LOCAL BANDS THAT YOU MISS VERY MUCH
<b>FALSE:</b> IT IS ON JANUARY 11TH WITH FORDIRELIFESAKE AND FOREVER ENDING (WHO MADE THOSE FLYERS?)
<b>TRUE:</b> OH MAN</font>

<font size=""-1""><b>my WEEKend with the WEAKend</b><br>
most of you know i got to take off to pennsylvania with the weakend the weekend before thanksgiving to watch them play with motion city soundtrack.  what most of you dont know is how sweet the trip was.  to be honest, I had no idea what to expect.  the guys arent like fhoo.  i used to take their different personalities as not liking me or soemthing but found out things that few have the ability to find out.  these guys are genuine, nice, trustworthy, hilarious guys.  its cool how word of mouth is spreading about them and how all the bigger bands know and like their disc.

<b>then joe and jim got in a kung fhoo match and punched eachother in the faces</b>
rumors are lame.  im glad im out of this rumor loop.  joe, jim, con, jeff, and drew drew are all happily in love and will continue to drop bombs in your ears for years to come (unless jeff gets pregnant or jim gets shot for peaking in the supina window.)

<b>sterling heights is for husslas</b>
this hold-em craze is causing me to sell drugs on the side.  tuesday and saturday night at ""MY HOUSE"" (if you havent heard im the preident of the flick.  all deals must go through me.  my first name is just as sweet as golboe's)  saturday was unreal.  we had to have a royal rumble in the living room to see which 15 players would be allowed to compete in the uber-tourney.  one hun-dough to the winner!  once again my flawless play fell victim to the amatuers, haha.  jim took home the pot and celebrated by climbing into a ""got milk?"" tshirt with me and that other brad kid.  i was too short so they didnt even know i was in the shirt.  i saw people at the 9 and mound show so hey to evryone i saw.  ""i want my-my money back""

<b>the knee'd for a kneecap</b>
my left kneecap doesnt exist anymore.  its like straight down from my thigh to calf.  my knee was hyperextended in the annual ""lets hop the fence at utica high and play 11 on 11 and hope we dont break eachother""/""thanksgiving weekend"" football fiasco.  my life sucks and im disproportionate.

<b>etc</b>
-erik pendergrass is still faster than me
-tom bahri looks great
-journeys is for juicy fruities
-mary-lou is properly spelled marilu
-tony boat's girlfriend wants me to kiss tony while she rubs my back
-im still not tall
-i love colin m's foam mattress
-i used to drum in alucard so watch what you say
-im not a playa i just bluff alot
-get the new strung out
-before i go is ""back on top""
-west virginia is just silly
-i still dont have a kneecap
-ive never baked pies with a girl  =("

its taken over a week to be able to write this entry

and yeah................it will be long

a week ago from last sunday i was on top of my game.  i won poker night with the guys, turned 20 bones into 400 bucks in a day, stayed in the Athenium Suites in Greektown for free and was wined and dined by a big 4 accounting firm, was visited by my favorite men (jim, joe and jeff), and witnessed the lions beat the undefeated falcons on the road to become 3 and 1.

shortly after the end of the game i got a call from megan saying caleb (our little brother.  one of the twins.  just 12 years old) was in the hospital and not feeling so well.  he was weak and throwing up.  first diagnosis was meningitis.  spinal tap came back negative so thye believed it was viral meningitis.  That menat he would be ok in time and his body would fight it off.

around 8pm i got a call from meg saying to get in my car and start driving south to pick up rachel because caleb was in critical condition and moved to the pediatric intensive care unit.  so i drove the longest 2.5 hour drive of my life.  me and rachel, my sister-to-be got to detroit around 10pm to find that caleb had been diagnosed braindead.  after 12 hours they would do tests to see if there was any brain activity.  if there wasnt, they would pull that plug.  

i spent that night in the hospital.  i spent a lot of time in prayer and a lot of time crying.  we sang some worship songs around his bed and prayed for a miracle.  jacob, stacey, rachel, granna, kendra (kims sister), and the boyfriends went home for a couple hours of sleep before the test but kim, jerry, megan, and i stayed the night.  ...not that i could sleep.

and in the morning we found out that caleb passed away.  ive always hated the term ""passed away"" but i just cnat say caleb died.  it doesnt seem real.  maybe im so distant.  maybe im in denial.  maybe i hate the word ""died"".  i made a lot of phone calls for the family.  it was hard because noone could believ it was caleb. he was in school that week and even was at soccer practice that thursday.

the visitation was thursday and the funeral was friday.  the spport was overwhelming and the fellowship from our churches at cmu and faith completely surrounded us.

i thought i could write this out but i cant

ill stop here

its frustrating because i cnat express having a complete broken heart.  its not an ""i lost my girlfriend"" thing

i lost a brother for life.  its hurts in a lot of places

i dunno

im done with this post"

"event","<font size=""-2"">word on the street is that my band broke up

monday we play the shelter for our second to last show

craziness

oh well though, i couldnt stand what we became

fromhereonout was a huge part of my life.  i gave half of my life to it.  its a shame to see it end but it might be time to move on.  yeah, im depressed.  yes, i feel noone will continue ot talk to me.  yes, i will miss it with all of my heart.

but i feel like i did it to have a positive influence on people.  i wanted re.ationships to go past the music and have a good influence opn peples lives.  as a member of the band im represented by its members.

im depressed, im discouraged, im disgruntled, im distant

but i guess things happen

with the proper motivation i will continue to make music,

well, party at my place.  maybe i didnt explain it all so well, but i will as it all unfolds.  a huge piece of me died but i guess ill move on

see you all soon

make sure you keep in touch

hopefully i positively influenced your lives.  that is what i wanted to do.

2. silver is up on purevolume.  stream away.

3. i had no idea who kurt cobain was until a year after he died.  i was listening to boys II men at the time.

4. this is my second post in less than a month.  pure craziness

5. i found my old basketball trading cards.  too bad a traded for all grant hilss and anfernee hardaways.  life is tough.

6. yeha i had pogs.  my slammers were better than yours.

7. if erik gets the student teaching job at stevenson this year he will be teaching at the school his fellow guitarist goes.  even better, if the student teaching turns into a full time job, rob will still be there.  how cute.  his math teacher can drive him to band practice after school.

8.  join myspace.  it makes peopel think your better looing than you actually are.  trust me it works.

9. seems like a good number to stop at</font></a>"

im moving up to mount pleasant for 6 weeks to attend two summer classes at cmu

ill be living with mike, lee, and barry and going to school monday to friday from 10 till 2pm

i will be coming home one weekend only, and it has not been decided yet

in light of the tragic events, a bunch of us will be meeting @ fuddruckers at 1pm tomorrow for some good eats and great times together

[fuddruckers is located at van dyke and 18.  for you easterners, its at the end of 53.]


<font size=+22>2</font>come on guys.  dont im me and say what bands blow.  ill point you to bands that are good for your music style.  ill suggust bands.  ill tell you straight up what genres im getting tired of, but these bands are all my friends and tring crazy hard.  i love them all to death and i want to see them all get ot be great musicians.  lets support them because i ws there at one point.

<font size=+22>4</font>i would love to close out his entry with a tribute to teh rumors that surround my life.
<b>a. erik is a racist bastard.</b> correction: he just tells jokes that some peopel dont understand.  call his humor dry, but dont call him a racist because of somethign he said three years ago.  
<b>b. from here on out booked teh 9 and mound hall forever and wont let anyone else play there. </b> correction.  we played there twice in a row and dropped the contract cause the place is too expensive.  the rumor coulnt be farther from the truth.  we are no longer working with ""that manager guy"" anymore.
<b>c. from here on out will only play one show a month and they have to throw it. </b> correction: last month we played three shows in one weekend.  one was co-thrown and two were for other promoters.  this definately goes against that myth.  we are very hard to book because we get liek 30 offers a day, but we do play shows more thna once a month.
<b>d. from here on out was extremely hurt by the loss of mike tomei.</b>  correction:its always hard losing a member.  it sometimes makes me lose sleep.  he did leave on weird term.  the truth is that he never really fit.  we wnated him to because he is an amazing musician.  we just know there are peopel with a lot more passion for our music and would die to have been in his shoes and are waiting to try to fill them.  we have one guy trying out right now tahst playing everyhting perfect and feels honored just to practice with us.  it just wasnt mikes thing.  his bro will be playing keys for us from now on.
<b>e. im an alcoholic.</b>  correction:im a narcoholic.  im 22 and have soem dirnks once in a while.  all they really are are sleeping pills for me though cause i fall asleep right away.  im legal and it has no control over me.  not too long ago i gave it up completely for 40 days.  thast not the sign of an alcoholic.
<b>f. all that other bad stuff about me.</b>  correction:im freaking sweet at stuff.


see you at fuddruckers or in a while

its been a while since i posted so comment the h-e-double hockeysticks out of this post.

are there any rumors i forgot?

<b>1. mama im coming home???</b>
so i get this email from plante and moran on monday stating that internships for this summer are full.  this is very bad news because they were my last hope.  however, the rest of the email explained how she would liek to talk to me about a full time job.  WHAT!!!  that owuld mean goign home in august for good, getting some suits, and makign crapy music.  wait, accountants can make good music right?  the crap thing is that meg was my next door neighbor for next year.  hmmmm, we will see this week.  im gettign a call back on friday.

<b>2. shows last weekend=superb</b>
picture a gym filled to the briim with liek 2,000 kids.  picture a high school senior on the mic announcing the band form her eon out and hearing a bunch of peopel cheering. (a lot louder than i ever would expect).  picture being me and looking to your left to find rob and mike.  picture me looking behind me to see paolo give me the weirdest look ever.  ""wheres erik"".  now picture me lookign to the right to see that there is no erik.  we were on a basketball court.  picture a guy coming in teh door on the other side of the court and strutting over to the band separating 1000 people on each side.  yeha thats erik.  it seemed plan, that little bastard.  but no, he lkes talking to old teachers.  it was hilarious to see him walking down and just waving at the kids.  the show was good.  it was more of a ""hey we are still alive and actually play tight shows now"" sort of show instead of a good sounding show.  it did itspurpose because i met  amillion peopel that night

first to play was my friend ehab.  they were there before us so i busted my chops ot set up, place was allready decently filled and kept getting bigger.  before i go did their thing too.  a public hanging came on and ripped a new butthole for the naysayers.  good music, good stage show, good guys.  ill make sure you see more of them.  a touring band played because they got stranded by another show.  they were called wellington (sp?).  we played next.  dang, ive you were you know why i loved it.  if you werent there, hmmm, i cnat describe the atmosphere so i ownt try.  i got to see a million of you.  made a lot of new friends through searchign aorund these journals for people that were there.  i was all smiles.  next came the chiodos bros and you ahve to see these guys to believe it.  they have a new sound that you have to hear.  sweet melodies, awesome breakdowns,  nice guys.

<b>3. purevolume.com</b>
hmmm.  i htought the crowd response on friday night was unexplainable.  well, in the past couple nights we have securely stood at the top spot for unsigned bands in the u.s. by plays.  we ahve had second place out of both signed and unsigned for a big part of it.  we were lucky enough to get picked by purevolume to be on their front page for a week.  i guess peopel enjoyed what they heard and keep listening.  we had almost 1900 streams on monday night.  that isnt as exciting as what has been happening because of it.  i have gotten instant messages from texas, new york, philly, new jersey, utah, ohio, south dakota, and california tellign us we have to come out there.  i have gotten emails form promotional companies and clothing companies about promotion and sponsorship.  we might have allready landed a clothing sponsor from buffalo.  i guess i wnat to say htanks for anyone who has been listening to the songs and thanks to everyone that is making detorit the place for show.  you ugys are crazy and bands might start getting out of here.  tear.  hopefully it keeps getting better.

or so says my hand in a kind of washed off sharpie sort of way

a very interesting weekend i had

i was at home, but whats new.  classes blow, and my friends dont.  so weekends belong to my lovers; music and friends.

friday was teh real deal.  who would have thought a show that was booked on wednesday and just told to a couple people over the internet would be so sweet.  there was a good 130 peoples in there.   there was a sweet vibe.  first time i saw urgent message and as dawn falls.  some sailor band played too.  who knows what their names are.  the are pretty hot though, in a boys-on-boys sort of way.  sunday was rad, not cause the hsow was rad, but soemthings people said to me will be remembered for a long time.  i wrote some poepel off that day, but gained a better understanding of some of my friends.  the night was complete with a long drive back to cmu with that girl i like and a call from a friend saying his elbow was doing pretty good.

(the first part of this entry has been sitting open on my computer since monday, it is now wednesday night so i guess ill finish it.)

its snowing a lot

(nope, not quite the closer i needed)

there we go.  i hear based on a true story might play their hit new tune ""rescue in the wreckage"".  i hear from here on out might play a 22 minute version of ""drop the system"", including 4 synth solos and an erik pendergrass beatbox that will make you wet your long underwear.

i am in love with the best thing that has ever happened to me.  in september of 2005 my life will change completely and my worries are fading away because i love megan with all my heart

my favortie local band is based on a true story.  innovative, fresh, true, talented, nice, great friends, respected.  finally i have found a brother band taht i cnat get enough of.  they give me hope in all of this.

i love poetry and photography and graphic design

hugs.  i hug peopel ive met at least twice.

my family is huge to me.  peopel need to know and respect the fact that my dad is the best person i have ever met.  most peopel that have met him would agree.  his support for me in everyhting i ahve done has made me who i am.

im done

hopefully through this new journal you will find out who i really am.  not just the kid who shows up at national or the singer of that band or that kid form church.

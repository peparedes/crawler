MY LIFE HAS JUST BEEN EXPLAINED. :O

the doctor thinks i do have fibromyalgia. no further tests required. it's over. i'm not lazy. or crazy. i will no longer be known as The Smart Girl Who Sadly Had No Willpower. suddenly i can tell people that i have this strange disease they've never heard of. and a doctor confirmed it. they might <em>believe</em> me - and if they don't, i can tell them they're assholes. ah, relief ...

"event","since i'm not exactly an expert on english grammar, seeing other people do things that i'm not familiar with usually makes me wonder if they know something i don't. one day i noticed that a person on my friends list would always underline movie titles in her posts, but another made them bold and a third put them in italics. confused, i decided to google this and found out that underlines were originally nothing but a way to signal ""this would be in italics if it were possible"" when that option was not available - for example in handwriting. it was not until the invention of hyperlinks that underlines were given their own purpose! well, i suppose they may have had a purpose before italics were invented, but now we're just going in circles. XD

the thing is, these are the only two ""text decorations"" that actually have a meaning. anything else is really just decoration. it bothers me that people don't seem to be aware of this - i keep hovering over ""links"" that are just underlined text, then wondering why my computer doesn't react. bolding for emphasis is not that great, either ... i only do it when i want a phrase to stick out from the rest of the text <em>a lot</em> because your eyes get drawn to it automatically and that can be <strong>distracting</strong> if it makes no sense. :P it's good for final conclusions, the most important parts of each paragraph and things like that, but not for simple <em>emphasis</em>. (lol) hence why the ""em"" html tag <em>italicises</em> text instead of making it bold.

... yeah, sorry, i had to get it out of my system. did you know i was easily distracted?"

"event","i knew what was coming. i should have known that there was nothing i could do to prevent it, but i attempted to do so anyway. it was a mistake, and yet everyone else will regard it as a good thing - optimism. such is life.

despite all my efforts, i just couldn't sleep. yesterday i thought getting back on track in time had suddenly become possible again since i was woken up by a screaming baby after less than five hours of sleep, and i was so tired all day that i would surely not lie awake at night this time ... but i did.

i've been awake - and tired! - for about 21 hours now. everything hurts. i find that a part of me seems to enjoy this type of pain, which is strange ... that doesn't happen in any other situation. i think it's because i know exactly what is going on: if i don't sleep, i will gradually go from a flu-like ache to a burning, evenly spread muscle pain. it's everywhere, it gets worse slowly, there is a reasonable explanation for it and i know for a fact that i only need to do one thing to get relief: go back to bed! it feels controllable. what i can't control is whether i'll sleep then, but lying down is often good enough.

i like this pain because it swallows anything else i may have had and then i know that i can make it stop before it gets too bad. there was a line in <em>the name of the wind</em> that stood out to me: something about enjoying the feeling that you're tired and will soon sleep. i had never really noticed before how much i like that feeling myself. the pain is only a sign of my tiredness in this case ... almost like a metaphor. i hurt, which means i'm tired, and for once i have the power to cure that. it's nice while it lasts.

next time i will deal with this differently. or, alternatively, i'll have access to sleeping pills by then ... *sigh* one week to go until i get my lab results. at least the other three went by fast."

"event","several things, such as the two books i've been reading and a comment on one of <lj user=""copperbadge"">'s posts (completely random, i know), have made me realize something: i am a storyteller and i'm here because i need an audience. heh. no, that's just the dramatic short version. i'm obviously sticking to livejournal because i've made friends here, but i've been wondering for a while why exactly i like this particular form of communication so much.

i was given my first paper journal when i was eight or so, but i rarely used it. i enjoyed writing letters and stories, but writing just for the sake of writing felt odd to me because i never knew what to say. no matter how often i tried to make myself keep it up, i always forgot about it after a while.

when i was 11 or 12, the journal entries that i did write often turned out pretty funny and i was so proud of them that i actually started to read from the thing. i mean aloud. to a friend. XD i wonder if there's anyone else on this planet who's done that. i think i've been writing <em>as if</em> i had an audience ever since, and sometimes i experimented with addressing an imaginary reader, but that didn't work out well.

online blogging took some time getting used to again, especially since my english wasn't very good yet when i started, and then i had to work out how much information i wanted to reveal about myself. once i had it figured out and got to know my first few friends, however, i loved it. suddenly i could express myself without addressing a specific person while still having an audience. my writing had a purpose! that made me happy.

i mentioned letters and stories up there, but eventually i figured out that <em>fictional</em> stories were not quite my thing. i suck at fiction. give me a plot to work with and i'll write you a book, but i cannot for the life of me come up with one of my own. i'm more of a prose person, seriously, although i <em>have</em> done a little bit of poetry, which doesn't require a plot.

i think that's why i loved <em>the name of the wind</em> so much - it's literally about a man telling someone else the story of his life. i do the same thing, except mine is not as exciting and doesn't involve any magic. i also enjoy writing essays and comments. anything but fiction ...

today i'm not very eloquent though. sorry about that."

i'm sorry, i think i don't quite understand. you mean like kids who are bullied because they're black should have surgery to become unblack and kids who are bullied because they're not smart enough should have brain surgery and kids who are bullied because they're gay should ... oh i dunno ... just shut up?? together with the poor kids, who sadly cannot be surgically made rich, either? WHAT. never mind disabled kids and those who are <em>too</em> smart. or those who OH MY GOODNESS dare to have unpopular opinions. i bet that can be fixed with surgery as well.<blockquote>As society becomes obsessed with celebrity and youth, women - and an increasing number of men - whose self-esteem has been punctured by ageing have discovered that their lives can be revolutionised by aesthetic plastic surgery.</blockquote>NO MY FRIENDS the answer is that society needs to become less obsessed with celebrity and youth, as you so nicely put it.

three years ago i was fed up with that and set out to create my personal Best Username Ever - <em>zillyjay</em> was the result. at the time it was perfect: it was unique, it meant something to me, people would know how to pronounce it, and nobody could tell just from reading it if i was male or female. i loved it. i really thought i had found the perfect name.

now, i'm not going to say that i was wrong. <em>zillyjay</em> fit me well for three whole years and that's a long time if you consider that i only joined livejournal four years ago. however, my life has changed dramatically since then and i will never be the same again. i moved away from home, i fell in love, i moved again, i had a baby and then i became sick (or sicker than before). i don't think i can be a zillyjay any longer. the zillyjay is a mysterious, anonymous, genderless internet person. zillyjays don't have babies. ;)

it's not just the name though, i really want to make a new start. this journal is all over the place by now; it started out as as a fandom and art thing with the occasional Serious Essay thrown in here and there, then it became personal and random, for a while i used tags and then i stopped, my subject lines used to be witty one day ... @_@

i think i'll do it once i've been officially diagnosed, or at the end of the year - whichever comes first. the only problem is - wait for it - that i can't think of a freaking new NAME!! *facepalm*

"event","i wrote some rather crazy things in this journal during the last few months, and to my own surprise i am not embarrassed of them. i get embarrassed way too often, sometimes for no real reason, but i've noticed that reading through the craziest thoughts i've had can reward me with unexpected helpful revelations. ironically i forgot what it was that inspired me to say this. XD

i've been thinking about the many different kinds of advice that i have encountered on the internet this year, and i noticed that about 90% of advice from people who have already overcome their problems is completely useless because they are practically speaking a different language. what really helps is when someone who is just as fed up with this phenomenon as you are tells you that you're not the only one feeling that way and then you can share very basic tips that sound so stupid that others would not even think of mentioning them.

i wonder if i can put this knowledge to use somehow. at the very least i have learned to dig a little deeper before i give up on something.

to give you an example, someone recently pointed out this excellent article that was some sort of fitness guide for beginners, but not ""beginners"" in the sense of ""average person"" ... i am talking about a level of fitness that you would rate -9 on a scale of 0 to 10. okay, i may be exaggerating just a little, but you get my point. even when i was at about a 3 or so on that scale, the guys at the gym told me to do 10 minutes of extremely fast-paced ""warmup"" before my 30 minutes of actual training on the elliptical, except i was already exhausted after those 10 minutes. it never occured to me that maybe, JUST MAYBE, the training plan was not quite right for me. i seriously thought that the 10 minutes were necessary to avoid injuries, and the 30 minutes were necessary to achieve any improvement at all. maybe if i had done 10 minutes of walking on the treadmill to warm up instead, followed by <em>15</em> minutes on the other thing, i would have been able to gradually increase my endurance. nobody thought to tell me that!

this is something i observe quite often: someone asks for help and others tell them to do something that is a complete new <em>goal</em> in and of itself. something that needs to be worked towards, not something that you can start doing right away in order to work towards your bigger goals. it gets especially bad in chronic disease communities, where the already-adequately-medicated who have had loads of time to get used to their limitations tell you that [X] would really help you, and you're like, ""ummmm. [X] is one of the things i wish i could do again, yes. now how do i go about that?""

i am reminded of one of my entries in which i said that even baby steps were too much for me at the time. what i have realized now is that baby steps are not the same for all people and that it is entirely possible to take miniature steps so small that nobody will know you have moved. for all my life i have been so preoccupied with trying to make visible improvement that i never realized what i could have been doing ""behind the scenes"" instead.

ETA: also, another thing that only occured to me after i'd long since left the gym is that the silly machine was monitoring my heartrate and i was freaking NERVOUS. really very nervous. not due to self-consciousness or anything, in fact i have no idea why. maybe that kind of movement makes me nervous. i never thought of asking the trainers whether it was a good idea to continue anyway ... and come to think of it, that may explain my bad results!"

One thing that gives me a headache from time to time is when an outsider, usually male, comments on a feminist blog and the following argument ensues:

Commenter: But if you really want to win people over, maybe you should rather do X than Y.
Blogger: WTF it is not my responsibility to educate the ignorant masses.

???

I mean ... who said it was your responsibility? True, it would be awesome if we could simply put up a few signs that say ""plz to be educating yourselves"" and everyone would, but sadly that's not going to happen. And even though it is certainly not your <em>responsibility</em> to change everyone else's minds, I was under the impression that <em>you wanted to.</em> So if a random person comes along and gives you a hint as to how you could possibly achieve <em>your own goal</em> faster, why do all y'all assume that they are thereby heaping loads of responsibility onto your shoulders?

I don't get it.

There are many other things like this one that I see being repeated over and over on all kinds of social rights related websites, and since I am easily distracted, they keep distracting me from what I actually went there for.

"event","I keep thinking that I'll probably gain weight if I am suddenly supplied with three proper meals a day and all. Which is not to say that I'm too thin, but logically I should expect this. You spend several months in a state of semi-starvation, you go back to adequate nutrition, you gain weight. Right? Some might say that it only happens if you previously <em>lost</em> weight, which I don't think I have, but there certainly is a chance that my body just did that lowering of metabolism thing when it noticed that it wasn't getting enough food, which may or may not be reversible ...

You know, I wouldn't be worrying about this if it weren't for the fact that I NEED PANTS.

I mean, I have two pairs of pants that are comfortable and two that are not. Out of the former, one is not warm enough for this time of year and the other looks ridiculous. The latter are what I force myself to wear if I have to go outside, and that's okay as long as I don't sit down ... but seriously, they just don't fit. Too small in some places, and yet they fall off if I don't wear a belt.

So I thought I should buy some new pants before I leave. I don't want to have to constantly switch between freezing, being looked at oddly and standing around like a misplaced object because sitting would be terribly uncomfortable or even painful.

But what if I actually manage to find pants that fit and then they only do so for a few weeks?? That would be a huge waste of money. What if I buy them one size too large just in case and then nothing happens?? Waaaaaaaah!

They've put me on the waiting list despite the fact that even the two doctors I spoke with thought it important to ""rule out"" (or not) any physical ailments ASAP, and practically had no idea how to accomplish that. But, er ... I guess this still tops doing nothing. And to my great surprise, the social workers are suddenly very enthusiastic about making sure that things progress quickly - for the first time in months I feel sort of supported by them.

What it comes down to is that I will get a phone call within the next few weeks and after that I'll be gone for a while. I'm not happy about it, but at least something's happening.

In other news, I just received four books in the mail. <em>Four</em> books! XD They are Neil Gaiman's <em>Stardust</em>, <em>Cowboy Feng's Space Bar and Grille</em> by Steven Brust, something called <em>The Name of the Wind</em> which is the first part of a series, The Kingkiller Chronicle, and a german one. I also want to buy the newest addition to Steven Brust's extremely awesome Vladimir Taltos series, but that will be done differently since I still have a gift coupon for a bookshop from my birthday last year.

YAY!! I hope I don't read all of them before the hospital stay. Which may be easier to accomplish than I first thought since I fear it'll already take me five days to decide what to start with. OMG ... too many good books ... I dunno where to look first ... aaaaah ... cannot decide ... do I want funny or serious or both ... awesomeness overload ... *brain explodes*"

"event","I almost made a post about socks yesterday. Unfortunately it evolved into this huge, rambly thing containing nearly all the thoughts I've ever had about fashion, and then I noticed what time it was. Oops! So I abandoned it. What happened next is another story, but I don't think that one will ever be told. I'm tired of explaining my daily struggles in a way that makes them sound somewhat comprehensible, especially since there's not much that people can say or do to help me anyway.

Now, as for those socks. I <em>like</em> socks. I dislike the annoying seams in the toe area that can poke you and tickle you and cause blisters, which is partly why I've been refusing to buy anything but sports socks for a long time ... not that those don't have them, but it's been my experience that they're more annoying in normal socks. Granted, seamless socks do exist. However the few pairs that I have owned so far turned out to be uncomfortable for other reasons.

Also, my feet get wet randomly. Once upon a time when I was trying to buy shoes, a shop assistant explained to me that it was cold sweat, and that ""some people just get this and others don't."" That's another reason to keep to sports socks, so I've been wearing those for many years.

Two days ago I was forced to put on pajama pants instead of normals ones due to a distinct lack of clothes in my closet, and thinking about how to avoid getting cold I remembered an old pair of knee highs that my mother once bought for me. They're sporty and warm and very ugly, but comfortable. So I thought, this is great. I need more of those, except in prettier colours ...

And that's all part of a new development that started when I got pregnant: Suddenly I had to improvise a lot, to take whatever I could get my hands on, and to pay more attention to comfortability than looks. You can't imagine how FREE that made me feel! It was amazing ... and I was <em>warm</em> most of the time. Wow. :O

Since I never really had my own style or anything, I mostly tried to wear whatever we could afford that would not make people point fingers at me. Sometimes I looked ridiculous anyway because I was very bad at that, but believe me if I say that I wasted way too much energy on trying.

Now that I actually have an idea what kinds of clothes I <em>enjoy wearing</em>, I'm also beginning to discover what I might want those things to look like. :)"

Without spitting it out again or failing to finish it. And it was more than just one ingredient. I'm still hungry, but ye gods and little fishes there is MORE food in the kitchen. I can just go there and eat it and hope that I'll be full then - but even if it's not quite enough, I know that I will at least be less hungry than last night. And the night before that. And ... you know. I will not wake up starving and nauseated, if a little late.

What a small accomplishment if you consider that I am actually supposed to do this several times a day. What a ridiculous accomplishment if you consider that most people don't even think about it. But today it makes me happy because even the act of trying to take baby steps has been too much for me lately, and I guess I just took a baby step. I should honour the times when it happens to be possible and ignore the really bad days.

NOW, just when i had warmed up to this new, old computer and saved a bunch of things on it that aren't on the laptop, guess what happened? our monitor died. just like that. yesterday evening it stopped displaying pixels and started making a funny noise instead. sort of as if it were going to explode, so i turned it off. which means that i'm back at the laptop again and i don't have access to our latest photos, my newest bookmarks and some other random files. great!

"event","i think that many people probably expect me to be a little overwhelmed by this whole new ""with child"" situation, but they're totally wrong. it feels like the most normal and natural thing in the world to me, as if my life had finally resumed its original state or something.

regular interaction with small children can transport you into some sort of parallel universe where it is absolutely necessary to have a specific set of things with you at all times, and functional clothes somehow appear to be a better option than pretty clothes. suddenly you don't feel embarrassed in certain situations anymore: it's okay, nobody will look at you funny - you're a <em>parent</em>. or a relative, or working with children, but that's not quite as cool.

as a parent, you are blessed with a great excuse for crazy behaviour and the amazing ability to <em>stop making such a fuss</em> ... at the expense of access to the Exclusive World of Childless People. it is up to each individual to decide if they think of this as freedom or torture. methinks that anyone who goes with ""torture"" has probably not quite stopped making a fuss after all.

life with children means that you normally have some kind of vehicle to return to even if you're not travelling by car. it means that you're unlikely to buy any beverages spontaneously because you've got some in your backpack anyway. it means that you don't have to rely on public toilets if you need to wash your hands - that's what wipes are for, right? it means that you should be prepared to get dirty unexpectedly and that something will always go wrong.

to me, all of this is normal. this parallel universe is where i come from; it's all i know. i have made a tentative venture into the Exclusive World of Childless People, too, but i didn't like it there and returned home without hesitation.

a mother who works in daycare and three younger siblings might do that to you. :)"

"event","i have been thinking about people using ""gay"" as an insult, related jokes and similar occurences. a lot. for weeks. (which means that, in case <lj user=""rubashov""> sees this, it was not your post that started it. coincidence!)

if you get involved in any kind of social rights movement, you'll soon be familiar with most of the others. before i stumbled into fat acceptance unsuspectingly while i was looking for information about food and health (lol - the irony, it burns), i had not been aware of any such movements' existence, aside from the very popular gay marriage problem. part of this is probably due to the fact that i live in germany - i suspect that we have lower levels of both discrimination and activism over here, but don't quote me on that one. maybe i am simply clueless as always.

and yet i have <em>never</em> understood why people laugh about jokes based on prejudice. not in an offended ""i spoil your fun by pointing out that this is unfair"" way, but as in i just don't think they're funny. you could be talking about the colour of the ceiling as far as i'm concerned. now, defenders of immature jokes might say that i'm lacking a sense of humour, however i doubt that anyone who knows me would second that. a single typo can make me laugh for several minutes, which is so silly that i'm embarrassed whenever it happens. think again.

when it comes to insults, i do get offended. intentions really DON'T matter since an insult is always based on something. try replacing the word in question with a random adjective: ""that's so orange."" ""what the hell, are you tall?!"" ... as you can see, it doesn't work. who would be offended by that? you'd only confuse your audience. <strong>in an ideal world, ""that's so gay"" would do nothing but confuse the audience as well.</strong> if you fully expect your opponent to <em>realize</em> that what you've just said was supposed to be an insult (serious or not), you are benefitting from the fact that many people still think of homosexuality as a bad thing, and thereby promoting that this doesn't need to change. even if your best friend IS gay and doesn't mind.

yes, i know that 99% of the people who'll see this are probably of the same opinion. *sigh*"

have you noticed what happened to the care bears lately? and NOW ... i've read a post at <a href=""http://the-f-word.org/"">the-f-word.org</a> which mentioned another, older post at a blog that is incidentally called ""the eph word"" (lol), about the transformation of <a href=""http://theeffword0877.blogspot.com/2007/03/say-it-isnt-so.html"">my little pony</a>. ye gods, what were they thinking?? i've never been a fan of ponies, but i happened to have some of those that were sold in the late eighties/early nineties ... for whichever reason. i probably hadn't asked for them, but i liked them. they smelled nice and i liked the colours and the symbols on their skin and they felt smoothe to the touch - my hands remember every little detail, it's fascinating. they were just the right weight, too, not as prone to falling over as those cheap plastic toys that come with a happy meal or something. they were PERFECT. and now kids will never have the pleasure of playing with them again. it makes me sad.

the new ones are just ... urgh. i wouldn't have liked them as a child. i wouldn't have liked the new pooh-bear, either. i'm not saying that because i don't like them now, as an adult; i actually <em>did not</em> like similar things back then. other brands produced smaller, slimmer, lighter ponies and i hated them. i was absolutely in love with the original winnie the pooh drawings, though - YES, the black and white ones - and also with the very first disney version. children don't care if a character is scribbled on paper or perfectly animated! well, nowadays they're trained to do so, unfortunately. they're constantly subjected to surreal, perfectionist depictions of everything until anything normal seems boring.

i'm so mad. why do they have to <em>improve</em> things like that if there was nothing wrong with them in the first place? there is so much more i could say about this topic, but it's all been said before."

well, i haven't been on a scale since the day before i gave birth because it would only tell me a meaningless number. i know what i used to weigh when i got pregnant, but my arms have become stronger from all the baby lifting, so they're probably heavier now. that alone is enough to make weighing myself completely pointless ... and it has also made me realize that with the myriad of things going on in our bodies at the same time, <em>no one</em> should pay much attention to numbers. if you must, look at yourself in a mirror. that should suffice.

on the other hand, i'm not so sure if i can always trust my eyes. during my almost-starvation period (i think i can safely say that it's over), i constantly suspected that i was getting fatter again. maybe it's a sign that i was really starving - distorted body image is said to be a common side effect. strange, huh? anyway, i've come to my senses now. if anything, i'm getting thinner. which surprises me because i had expected the whacky eating to lower my metabolism. apparently i have an indestructible super metabolism! which definitely makes me my #1 favourite lab rat. ;)

then again, they say it takes another nine months until you're back to normal after a pregnancy. it's been five. it seems insane that some women try to achieve the same thing in just a few weeks."

"event","i have established that in order to feel better, i need to do the following two things:

<ol><li>lie down to rest more often.</li><li>find some kind of food that doesn't have to be prepared in any way, to eat directly after waking up.</li></ol>
at the very least, that is.

it's weird. if i get up around noon or even later because i've once again slept at the ""wrong"" time, i might be hungry but breakfast can wait until i'm fully awake and then i'll have whatever i want to. if i get up in the morning, though, i feel absolutely awful and so tired that even standing in front of the fridge trying to make a decision can be too much work - never mind lifting a knife, fork or spoon. seriously. but at the same time i seem to need food more urgently than usual! it helps with the awful feeling. that's why i just want something that i can simply take and bite into, or else i'll spend an hour on the couch, hungry but not eating.

i should make a list. three to five different things perhaps, so that i'll still have a choice. bananas are an option because you don't have to do anything with them, but somehow i don't want to risk buying more than two at a time. they always go bad. i don't know why we so rarely feel like eating them. then there are biscuits/cookies/etc. - we'll have to spend some time in that area of the supermarket to find the perfect type. hmm. that's all i can think of for now."

"event","i'm still not eating enough - or regularly enough - but i've made some progress on that front. we usually have at least one proper meal a day now, which is a start. we're also getting better at trying out new stuff, making an effort instead of just heating up canned food and so on.

aside from that, i'm totally on a vegetable trip at the moment. i've discovered that i do NOT like roasted zucchini, that brussels sprouts (YUM!) don't taste any different no matter how you prepare them (or maybe this only applies if they were previously frozen?), and that boiled kohlrabi* with butter is one of the most delicious things in the world. we used to eat that with something or other when i was a child, but it had completely slipped my memory.

general conclusion of the month: if you do not like raw veggies, don't make the mistake to think that you don't like them at all. this is what happened to me. i hardly ate <em>any</em> during the last few years** because i was under the impression that eating them raw was somehow ""better"" than cooking them, and as a result forgot that they could actually be tasty. *facepalm*

i also had scrambled eggs for breakfast. heee. :D

"event","yesterday we bought a desk and then we discovered that several parts were missing when we tried to put it together. smart! however, the issue has already been resolved and since it's not random pieces, but actually a whole additional package, they're going to send it to us ASAP. well, okay. i can live with that. we also bought an awesome chair to go with it, a small lamp, a clock and a sideboard (or something) for the stereo, which currently resides on our very large window sill. this will improve the state of our living room a lot. :)

as we were trying to find the store, the guy who drove us kept deciding not to ask certain people for the way because they didn't look like they could help, according to him. *rolls eyes* and then, when i once again asked him why he didn't think that boy over there might know where the store was (the kid in question was probably old enough to have an idea, and also happened to be rather chubby), he said ............. ""he probably doesn't - unless they sell food there.""

aha!! i could have predicted that. he's an idiot anyway.

so i said, ""<em>that's mean</em>."" simple and easy. the boyfriend nodded agreement, which surprised me a little and made me happy. i don't remember what exactly he replied, but i think it was something as stupid as ""well, it's probably true."" d'oh! wrong answer. i briefly mentioned my good old friend e., who could always eat mountains and was as thin as a stick, and that i like food a lot myself, and concluded that you can't tell a person's lifestyle from the way they look.

he was at a loss for words then, so i let it pass. hmm."

"event","one of the most interesting things that i've learned lately is that contrary to popular belief, people are actually <em>more active</em> today than 20-30 years ago. at first i was surprised, but then i thought about it some more and it started to make sense until i was almost like, ""i could have told you that."" unfortunately i have piled on so many bookmarks by now that i can't find the source of this statement among them anymore (lol), but i don't doubt that it is true.

just think about it. yes, there's the internet and video games and lots of other ""bad"" stuff glueing us to our seats now, but do you really think that computer freaks were any different in the eighties? do you really think that people were <em>more active</em> when reading books was still a popular pastime? do you really think that there were less nerds, less lazy teenagers et cetera in the seventies?

you have to acknowledge that there are many different types of personalities out there. what do they use the internet for? communicating? how is that in any way different than sitting around with a phone in your hand, or writing letters? what about research? does it matter if you go to the library and work your way through 25 books until you've finally found what you were looking for, or if you quickly sit down at the computer, google it, print out the page and return to what you were doing earlier? does it make a difference if children play video games instead of board games? in terms of movement, that is.

people will do what they're interested in and the only thing that's changed is how. but now, consider <strong>this:</strong> 20-30 years ago, the pressure to be physically active and ""healthy"" wasn't nearly as high as it is today. i don't think that kids as young as 13 years old were already <em>forcing themselves</em> to go running on a regular basis back then. i don't think that perfectly healthy women went to the gym to become <em>even healthier</em>. i seriously don't think there has ever been this much interest in exercising just for the sake of exercising!

so obviously we are NOT becoming lazier and lazier by the minute. i could have told you that, except i was a bit deluded by popular belief.

ETA: i suggest that we spend more time and effort on teaching people how to be <em>friendlier</em> instead. because let's face the facts, that's much more important."

"event","ouch ouch ouch my arm hurts so much and i'm thinking about sandwiches. i always wonder what people are talking about when they mention them because i suspect that it's not exactly what i think it is. when i say that i've made myself a sandwich, this is a very rare occurence and it involves two slices of toast with a lot of stuff between them. maybe people just eat way more sandwiches in other parts of the world and i'm actually right and the one person who called bread and cheese a sandwich was wrong, but i don't know. food talk in a foreign language is always confusing. also, apparently we absolutely WIN at bread over here. :P i've heard people say that who went to germany for the first time, i just don't know when or where. then again, i think we lose at breakfast.

"event","it was a hot tuesday afternoon as i sat on an uncomfortable chair at the doctor's office, waiting impatiently with a fascinated baby on my lap. there was an aquarium. he stared at it in wonder while i nervously contemplated what the doctor might be telling his daddy in the meantime. would he berate him, confuse him, make him feel bad like all the other <em>smart people</em> always do? i have never believed in smart people, but he does. he believes. he is naive, even more so than i am, which is almost impossible and should be illegal.

doctors tend to ask the wrong questions, or none. <em>most likely none</em>, i thought as he eventually emerged with a look of uncertain dissatisfaction on his face.

""hm?""

a shrug. being the one with the bag, i was handed two scraps of paper to put away. his blood levels? well, he didn't seem to be dying and there was nothing particularly unusual about them, but his cholesterol happened to be a bit high.

<em>ooooooohh.</em>

i've been reading about that, you know. a lot. hearing it said out loud felt like playing risk factor bingo. excitement! we left the building and got worked up about how long we'd been in there for a while until i started asking him questions. had he ever had high cholesterol before? had it happened to anyone else in his family?

""i don't know.""

overflowing with assumptions and theories, i somehow mentioned food. oh, he said. ""he gave me a list of things i should avoid, it must be on one of those scraps of paper."" wait, what? there's a diet plan in my bag and i'm not reading it yet?? more excitement. i mentally prepared myself for a good round of sporking and unfolded what looked suspiciously like a one-fits-all standard recommendation for Imperfect People&#153;.

as i told him what he was supposed to be not-eating, my voice grew louder with each item ... whether from suppressed laughter or suppressed anger, i'm not sure. in any case i enjoyed seeing his facial expression change from curious to incredulous, and finally dismissive.

""so basically,"" i concluded, ""you just avoid anything tasty and you'll be fine.""

we've been making fun of that thing for days. :)

<small>btw, since this is absolutely new and he's been eating exactly the same as always except for maybe a little less meat, i think the explanation is quite obvious: he's under a lot of pressure right now, and stress has been shown to raise cholesterol levels. i mean, ""it's the stress"" sounds like a really bad excuse, but seriously - in his case, it's <em>always</em> the stress. o_O i've caught myself a very stress sensitive boyfriend. ;)</small>"

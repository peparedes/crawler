"event","Today was my big interview.

My guest was a mortician.

Everyone took their places as cameraperson, director, assistant director, audio, stage manager, lights, switcher, etc.

And then...

I.
Kicked.
Major.
Ass.

Mr. Mann said that it was the best interview that he's seen all semester!

I was prepared, had great questions, great follow-up questions, great eye contact, great presence, I look good on camera... I think I'm going to be chosen for the very exclusive anchor spot in the Bronc News class next semester.

I know I'm a good writer, but this is something that is fun and challenging. It forces me to use my people skills and my writing abilities. This is the perfect job for me. And today I found out that I don't suck at it. Best feeling ever!

I'm looking into taking communication classes abroad. They're offering one in Paris (bliss!) and Brazil (hott!), among other places. Tomorrow, I'll go talk to Ms. Rangel. She's always really helpful. And she's pretty.

I have a bright future doing what I love doing. The only thing better than this would be to get paid to play with poodles and kittens all day long. But seeing as how that's not going to happen... this is great.

Now I just want this sleeping pill that I took to lose effect so I won't walk around zombified like I have been. 

I also would like some pizza. Or Italian food. Or to go to an Italian place and eat all of the above. Mmm!

To celebrate. And eat. And feel good.

A date with Catty-Cat will work, though!

The next time, she'll stick her head in the bowl, expecting to drink water from below the halfway mark, and sniff and cough because she got water in her face.
It's the cutest thing.

Russian Circles was super. I liked them a lot.
The bartenders made strong drinks.
Annalee and I are ""BFF"" now.
Eric asked me a weird question, and I don't know what to make of it.
Anthony was absolute perfection, like always.
It was freezing.
I made new friends.
I took off my double socks and showed off my supercute feet. 
I argued with Scott on whether American Sign Language is considered a foreign language. 
I got earaches.
I stood with Eric and watched Minus the Bear. 
They made me dance and happy.
Jess and Abbie are great.

I'm putting in my applications to ACC, UT, and Concordia for summer classes this week.
Maybe a temporary change in scenery will help.

Micha got Student of the Week. Yeah. Baby.

I'm going out with Nate tomorrow. He's taking me to one of my favorite places ever... the carnival! He promised to get on all the scary rides with me. I'm really looking foward to that.

Should I dye my hair dark?

The kitten is going to be the end of me.

The Good Life + me = &hearts;

I'm still debating over whether or not to go see Cursive. I want to, because I LOVE Cursive and Tim Kasher. I don't want to, because Happy Hollow is pretty much anti-Christian. The music is GREAT, but I'm not sure if I want to be in that kind of enviornment. I'll probobly end up going.
I'm going to the Blood Brothers and Straylight Run shows. For sure!
I would gnaw my foot off at the ankle for John Nolan. Hell, I'd do it for Michelle Nolan too.
That's going to be amazing!
I'll be at my happiest at that show.

I'm gonna go eat Taco Rico now.

Hey, I'm glad you're happy."

I was driving West on Nolana, where it gets really dark, except for the occassional street light, and as I passed one, I caught my reflection. I noticed that tonight, I had a really pretty smile. It was just a shame that I didn't use it much. Nothing's wrong. It's just one of those days, I guess. Anyway, I thought that since it's rare that I find myself even mildly pretty at all, I should take a picture of that smile. In my car. On Nolana. In the dark.<br /><br />Then I got home, uploaded the picture, and decided that it wasn't that great after all, haha.<br /><br />No worries.<br /><br />Catty-Cat and I found a pill bug on my bed.

I ran to my parent's room to wake them up and tell them. 

They were sad too. 

Gosh, I remember buying my dad a flashlight keychain for Christmas a few years ago. It had a plastic crocodile floating around in a tube of water and glitter. My dad liked it a lot. 

One year, a long time ago, we had just upgraded from cable to satelite. The first thing we watched was The Crocodile Hunter. 

Steve Irwin was part of the family. 

We all got happy and celebrated when both of his kids were born. 

And now we're sad that he died.

And it's still not over.

I'm in a hotel in Bushnell right now. A long hot shower was needed after using Wet Wipes to ""bathe"" in the tent since Sunday. Plus, I caught a horrible cold. Still, nothing beats this.

God has truly blessed me with this experience.

I love being here with some of the people I care most for. I love having met so many new people. I love reaching out and praising God in so many different ways here. That's the best part about this whole thing. That's why I came. And I am so thankful for it.

Widows&Orphans played today. They did AMAZING! The president of Tooth and Nail missed mewithoutyou's set to watch W&O's entired set. I think that's a good sign. Also, two people from Floodgate were there also and have requested a meeting with the band. We're all just not worrying or hoping for anything. They're just going to let God handle it. And breathe easy.

Aaron Weiss is delivering a sermon a few feet away from our tent on Saturday. There is no way I'm going to miss it. I know I'll grow as a Christian just by being around him. He is so inspirational and so in love with God that you can feel it. You can tell that he reaches out to God and tries to praise Him with every breath, with every step... 

Today I saw a boy wearing a shirt with a dinosaur on it. It said, ""Extinct. No. You stink!"" That made my day and I told everyone about it. They laughed. 

It's 3 AM. I'm gonna go rest and meet up with the rest of me (Anthony) and the boys in a few hours, so I should get some sleep.

On a much lesser note: I have been obssessed with wings (like the kind birds have, not the kind you eat) since I saw X3. My first thought out of the theatre was, 'I want my boyfriend to have wings.' I'm thinking of getting wings tattooed on my back. Above my back piece. Not huge, but small wings that are proportionate to my back. I'm still pondering on this idea... I don't know if I'll be as enthustiastic about my wings when I'm 40. Or 60. Or 22 even. I'll pray about it and see what God wants me to do.

"event","Today I attended the most solemn of human rituals.

A funeral.

My good friend, Myra's, older sister, Maggie, died in a very serious car accident.

She was a loving wife, sister, daughter, and friend. She was a registered nurse who worked in home healthcare. She died going from one patient to another.

I went to a Catholic mass that was intended, I think, to comfort the family. A mosquito was biting my ankles the entire time. Although I am not Catholic, I used to be, and I felt a peace being in a Catholic church during a Catholic ceremony.

As I sat in the pew at the church, I saw people filing into the church. A lot of them were fellow nurses who worked with Maggie. They all wore purple scrubs. The church was almost filled with family and friends.

I wondered if that many people would go to my service when I died. How much of my family would attend? Would it only be my immediate family? Would few friends come?

I always figured that the amount of people who go to a person's funeral is a good indication of how many lives that person touched during their life. 

I wonder if I do. I've always figured that you're on Earth to do God's will until He needs you in Heaven. What if I'm doing a crappy job of that?

I hope that when I die, that no one cries. Because really, dying is the best thing that could happen to a person. God is choosing you to come home. He's singling you out of tons of people, because He's prepared a room for you in Heaven and feels that you're perfect enough to join Him.

Of course, it feels crappy to lose someone. I'm not afraid to die, but I know I'd be homesick for my family and close friends. Even in Heaven.

I'm not going out of my way to die or anything, but I'm not afraid of it. When my Father wants me to come home, I'll be looking foward to going. There will be a party up in Heaven for me. And I know God knows me well enough to make it pink. With poodles.

[Bitch moment over... now!]

Anthony will be here for over a week this time. That's wonderful! 

We should hang out! I'm talking to you, Collin! 

I should stock up on Dr. Pepper for him. Actually, he needs to stop that. Danitza made a good point earlier when she said that he should start drinking more water to avoid kidney stones later in life. I'm planning on being there 'later in life,' and really don't want to deal with that, so we need to start drinking the H2O.

But according to Anthony, life is composed of Dr. Pepper, cigarettes, and BBQs. He is such a redneck. I'm dating a hillbilly hick. And that makes life so much more interesting.

I'm talking to my friend, Jessica. Anthony's fell asleep on her living room floor next to Scott and Colin playing video games. Why do I find that do endearing? I must have it bad for this boy. And that's totally okay!

OH! When he was here two weeks ago, he was super enthused about buying a 'gangsta' hat. He's was like, ""how rock and roll would it be to wear a gangsta hat?"" Okay, whatever. We went to the mall and bought a gangsta hat. All black with a 'D' on it. We have no clue what the 'D' stands for, but there you go. Anyway, I was under agreement to him buying the hat, because I figured he'd use it sparingly as an accessory. I was wrong. He won't take the hat off. And I hate it. He thinks he looks so cool with the hat. I mean, he looks great, but I love his hair, and miss seeing it. Jessica, his best friend, has also expressed concern over that hat. She hates it. So this week when he's here, I'm taking the hat. Jessica thinks that he wears it because he thinks I like it. I don't like the hat. The hat is going down.

I'm meeting all of Anthony's friends tomorrow. They're all getting together at Jessica's house to meet me. I feel special. Anthony says not to worry. He says they'll love me. I'm not too worried. He loves me and that's all that matters.

There you go.

Tomorrow I'm getting the oil changed in my car.

And Monday, Isaac and I are off to Austin.

Anyone wanna join us on a roadtrip? Lol...


Hugs, kisses, and loving a boy named Isaac tons, Sara"

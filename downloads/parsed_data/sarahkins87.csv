Grab the nearest book, open to page 123, find the fifth sentence. Then post the next three sentences.

   ""It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to its proper use,"" said the dwarf.
   ""True,"" said the Witch; and then, ""Well, I will begin.""
   At that moment with a rush and a snarl a Wolf rushed up to them.

"event","So basically a whole term has gone by between my last post and this one and let me tell you.... well not much has happened. Let me sum it up for you:

-Lucy came to visit. Very fun!! So good to see her.
-I went to class. A lot.
-I did homework. A lot.
-I planned many things that did not end up happening. Camping people!!!
-I got super drunk at Cafe Crepe of all places and fell down twice. Well I was pushed over the first time. But hey, at least I didn't end up in a puddle like one friend. (Have been drinking more than this- don't worry! This night just stands out to me)
-Experienced the apocalypse: Vancouver with more than 3 inches of snow. It's been weeks and a main road is STILL closed!
-Dealt with non-drinkable tap water for weeks. Stupid turbidity.
-I did a bit more homework.
-Went to more classes.

And that's about it. But despite the lack of huge events it's been a really good term. Now if only the stupid exams would just be over!!"

"event","Well I started packing today for going back to Vancouver on Monday. My room is an absolute tip right now. Have basically filled the bigger of the 2 bags I can bring and that's just with my clothes- haven't even started with the random stuff all over my room. Plus there's still some clothes that are being washed or need to be washed. Oh and my wellies! Must not forget them even though the one time I wore them they absolutely killed my feet. They're just so cute!

I just cannot believe that summer is over. My last shift at work was yesterday, so strange. No more having to work in a shop with broken air conditioning. It's sad though, I'll miss it. Not the evil customers though. God people are so rude!

Well I'm off to get ready for going out for dinner."

I think she really wants me to do it but in between me moving here and so stopping my horse riding lessons and now I have developed a little phobia of horses. Not really sure how it happened though- I used to love them! I haven't been riding in years! I told her I'd think about it- could be fun... but what is I squish the horsie?!"

Start tomorrow doing a 4 hour shift, wow haven't had a 4 hour shift in almost a year (haven't had a shift at all but that's besides the point). I hope it all goes well! I'm not the most stylish person ever but apparently I'm good enough. In the interview I had to put together an outfit that was suitable for a picnic during the day but could be changed easily to a dance at night- thought I hadn't done too well but it doesn't matter now.

Was joking with Danielle that if I for some reason ever made a musical I'd just change the sad ending of one that already existed and make it happy. Everyone loves a happy ending!

Not too much else happening, taking Danielle to the bus station in a bit since she's going back to Glasgow. I think I'm going out into town tonight with Charlotte and Val, not sure if anyone else is going but should hopefully be fun :)"

"event","Well since Lucy keeps bugging me to update (even though she hasn't for over a year!!) I decided today would be the day. And since I've doen absolutely nothing the past couple weeks this is going to be a super boring update.

So have been home from uni for just less than 2 weeks and have done basically nothing, I have attempted to find a job (absolutely no jobs available right now!!), seen a couple friends, but everyone is either not in Aberdeen or working all week if they are here. Thankfully Danielle will be back for a week from Thurs before abandoning me again! But Charc will be back the 20th for good. So the past couple days I have done absolutely nothing, I've watched tv and walked my dog. I've barely even driven, should really drive today although no idea where. May pick up Danielle from bus station on Thurs which she'll be happy about.

So yeah, nothing's happening at all. I just made myself lunch. Very exciting. Umm... listening to Van Halen right now... yeah that's about it."

"event","I just watched the best episode of One Tree Hill in well over a year. My faith in the show is slowly being restored. I totally love Nathan (James Lafferty) he's so sweet. Awww.

Yeah, I should have spent this afternoon studying but I went out to meet my sister and aunt for lunch and didn't get back until 4 and have now just spent an hour watching one tree hill. I love lazy sundays. They're like the best thing ever.

Will be at home in 10 days!!!"

I finish class an hour and a half earlier than usual so get back to my room around 10:30 and just hop into bed, next thing I know it's 20 to 1 and I was meant to meet people for lunch at 12, so I go and grab some food to bring back then sit infront of tv watching nothing really then go back to my room and watch a dvd which I half sleep through. And even now all I feel like doing is sleeping. Why am I so tired today? It's not as though I got no sleep last night... although I did have a weird dream so maybe that messed with my deep sleepingness."

I put up a bunch of pics today so I'm feeling better about my room, has more stuff to make it feel more like home. I wish I had more pics from this past month though. I haven't been taking any pics and I know it's gonna annoy me later. I like having pics to remember randomn things.

Still haven't cleaned my room, that was my goal for this weekend but I somehow found other things to do. Doesn't even feel like it was a long weekend sadly. Anyway I'd better get going and attempt to look at some physics... or wash my hair. It's kinda gross right now."

"event","Once upon a time there lived a giant piece of corn. His name was Fred. One evening Fred went to the grocery cart because he felt hungry. So then he bought seventeen litres of milk and eighty-two bottles of purple juice. After that he met Sally and they saw a movie at the grocery cart parking lot. When they sat to watch the movie Sally fell to her death. Fred was shocked and very sad so he decided to go to the circus and become a lion tamer. After he decided to become a monkey's friend, the lions just weren't cutting it. They were very upset that he abandoned them, but they smelled funny so it all worked out ok. 

One day Fred's best friend decided that they were going to go on a vacation away from the circus together. Fred agreed and they set out to decide where to go. they figured that they would travel approximately 43 degrees north west until they came upon a hamburger stand where they decided to stop to get a bite eat. It was there that they met Collette. She was so ugly that they did not know what to say, but she did not know what to say either. For what do you say to a giant piece of corn and his best friend?

Plans for tomorrow are to go buy a computer, look at the house my parents own and go out to dinner with my Grandma and Aunt and Uncle which should be nice. No idea how well we'll stick to the plan though. May also try and find some new ceramic hair straighteners. Anyway I'd better go.

Guettel and Goldman to Team on 'Princess Bride' Musical 
Robert Simonson Playbill On-Line 
Fri Aug 12, 2:45 PM ET


Composer Adam Guettel and screenwriter William Goldman will collaborate on a musical version or the hit fairy tale film ""The Princess Bride,"" the New York Post reported.

The 1987 Rob Reiner-directed movie fits the teasing description Guettel gave for his next project, while speaking backstage at the 2005 Tony Awards. While hesitant to specifically name his next musical due to ""legal reasons,"" he did say it would have a ""fairy tale"" nature and would involve ""a lot of swordfighting.""

""The Princess Bride"" delighted audiences with its mix of sincere medieval magic and mocking parody of the swashbuckling film genre. The flick starred Cary Elwes and Robin Wright as each other's true love, and Chris Sarandon as the evil prince who would keep them apart. The film also starred Mandy Patinkin as a swordsman out for vengeance, Christopher Guest as another baddie, Wallace Shawn and Andre the Giant as two unlikely compatriots, and Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as an ancient wizard and his wife.

The material would make for a decided shift to the lighthearted for Guettel, whose two previous musicals, Floyd Collins and The Light in the Piazza, both examine the darker and moodier sides of human nature.

Goldman is a famed screenwriter known for the films ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" ""All the President's Men"" and ""Marathon Man."" He also wrote the classic examination of the Broadway world, ""The Season.""

OMG!!!! This could be so totally awesome!!"

I just wish my family weren't going to be so far away. I'd be looking forward to this so much more if I knew that I could see them again before Christmas. I guess Christmas isn't that far away though. Only about four months, of course there is a chance I might not get home for Christmas but I really want to!!

Anyway I'm off to see a movie with Rosie tonight, Danielle cancelled. There's drama going on between her and Rosie right now. They both apparently hate each other which is interesting. Oh well, gonna see wedding crashers which looks so good! Then tomorrow I'm off to the bank in the morning with my mom before meeting up with Rosie again to go to codonas and see Herbie: Fully Loaded. Then that night I'm meeting up with Julie for either a meal or drinks. Leaving me with only Friday to see Charc, Danielle, Jenny and (especially) Christine and Val since I haven't seen the 2 of them since like June. So crazy! Won't be seeing Merel again for a while as I don't think she's coming back from Holland in time which sucks but oh well. Not much I can do."

It's messy because me and my mom have been going through drawers and my closet and stuff and trying to sort out what I'm taking, what's staying and what's getting thrown out. Makes for a mess.

Anyway, should be going out tonight with a couple friends, will be fun :) May be my last night out in town before moving. So crazy! Going out tomorrow night too but for dinner at Little Italy. Not much else is happening, spending more time on organising all my stuff today. Oh, found out yesterday I have a single room in an all girls dorm and am on the ground floor. Not really sure if this is good or bad, but I do know I wish I wasn't on the ground floor. I'm not sure why but I just wish I was at least one floor up. Oh well, nothing I can do about it."

The guest speaker person was so boring, I have no idea what she was going on about. I was more worried that the guy sitting next to me was going to puke. He was <i>way</i> hungover.

Last couple days were so fun! Almost everyone in the year went down to Allan park Wednesday afternoon and most stayed until the police showed up and took away all the (remaining) alcohol. Really need to post some of my pics up on a photobucket thing. 

Had English exam on Friday. Did not go well. At all. Very bad. But only worth 30% and that's all that will be said of that.

Math exam is this coming Friday. Have really not done enough revision. I'm going to try a past paper tomorrow and hopefully will do better than the last one I tried which I would have failed. Great fun.

This time in two months I will be in Australia!! So very cool!"

So crap. I'm so pissed off and I have to go to work which I do not like and find extremely boring. It's crap. I can't wait until the end of June.

Blah I wish I was still like 14 and didn't have to grow up."

"event","Not too much has been happening. Only one month left of school... ever! So crazy. I can't even imagine it even though it's going to happen in one month. One month. I just can't believe it.

So school's going to be a bit crazy for the next month and pretty soon I'm gonna start freaking out over exams, I really don't deal well with stress... or studying. I am excellent at procrastinating. I should get an award.

Although I should most definately not get an award for the reflective essay I am writing right now for English, it's really not very good. But I'll hand it in anyway because I have to write another one within the month. Not fun. 

Everyone's getting their leavers ball dresses now, they're all so nice. Mine just isn't <i>that</i> special. Well it is but it also isn't. I can't decide. I'm sure I'll like it when I try it on again :)

Ok, better go work on essay. I want to hand it in tomorrow so I can get it back as soon as possible."

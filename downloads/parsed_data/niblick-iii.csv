"event","Bloody hell it&#39;s hot this weekend. Properly boiling. Didn&#39;t get to sleep until after 3am, and even then it wasn&#39;t until I got a cold flannel<br />that I could drop off.<br />I have had my doors and windows wide open all day and the thermometer attached to my alarm clock still registers 29.4C<br />I had a proper, honest to goodness cold shower ealier. And I went from shivering to too hot in less thn 20 minutes.<br /><br />So basically, what I have done since my last post was to melt. And watch Shakespeare. Which mostly makes me want to say &quot;don&#39;t watch The Hollow Crown&quot;. Tom Hiddleston is very good as Henry, that I can&#39;t deny. But it is a <i>terrible</i> adaptation of the Henrys, all told. They cut all the funny bits from Henry V, and manage to kill all the comedy in Henry IV. Which is hard, cos it is a damn funny play.&nbsp; I think, for a start, Falstaff is horribly miscast. I mean, I admit my bias, and I was unlikely to think anyone was better than Roger Allam in the role. But the man won an Olivier for a reason. Simon Russel Beale just isn&#39;t funny. And, put simply, Falstaff is to comedy what Hamlet is tragedy. Falstaff is one of Shakspeares finest comic creations, and I never found him funny. Not only that, but he was lacking in charm and you just couldn&#39;t tell why the young Hal would be friends with this man.<br />The other issue was that the focus of Henry IV was all wrong. They focussed on driving towards the battles in Part Two and Hal&#39;s interaction with his father. When the absolute <i>heart&nbsp; </i>of the story is the relationship between Hal and Falstaff. Huh. I get to use my &quot;destroying the languuage of Shakespeare&quot; tag in an absolutely literal sense.<br /><br />Anyway, enough moaning, because I also watched<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Sex, Lies and Videotape (1989)""><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098724/"">Sex, Lies and Videotape (1989)</a><br /><br /><img alt=""Sex, Lies And Videotape"" height=""312"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/136110/original.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" title=""Sex, Lies And Videotape"" width=""200"" /><br />This was on my list because James Spader. Duh.<br />I&#39;m not sure I get this movie&#39;s claims to being a comedy. I mean. It&#39;s not deadly serious. But it&#39;s not exactly... <i>funny</i>. Apart from James Spaders hair. That is fucking hilarious. It looks like he&#39;s stolen Eric Idle&#39;s hair. Or my Mum&#39;s circa 1986. See:<br /><img alt=""James Spader's even more ridiculous hair"" border=""0"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/136339/original.jpg"" title=""James Spader's even more ridiculous hair"" /><br /><br />You have to admit. That is pretty funny.<br /><br />But if I had to categorise the movie, I would definitely put it in the People Stand About In Rooms And Talk About Their Feelings genre.<br />So.<br />The plot.<br />Andie MacDowell is talking to her therapist about...well. Her feelings.<br />She is married to a douchebag who is fucking her sister, the best friend from Pretty Woman. It&#39;s not even dignified enough to be called an affair.<br />Anyway, he&#39;s invited an old college friend to stay. Enter James Spader.<br />So, Andie MacDowell and James Spader... talk about their feelings. Andie MacDowell explains that she thinks sex is overrated, and James Spader explains he is impotent, or at least &quot;unable to hold an erection in the presence of others&quot; which is functionally the same thing. Because this is the conversation you have with someone you&#39;ve just met.<br />Andie MacDowell&#39;s sister continues to fuck her husband, and decides she wants James Spader as well.<br />Some more feelings are talked about.<br />Andie MacDowell discovers that James Spader videos women talking about sex so that he can masturbate to them later. With, I should point out, the women&#39;s knowledge and consent.<br />Anyway, Andie MacDowell freaks the fuck out and her sister goes over to James Spader&#39;s place and makes a video. Douchebag husband freaks the fuck out about it, but the sister points out that he has zero say over what she does.<br />Andie MacDowell begins to suspect her douchebag husband is fucking her sister, and he proves he&#39;s even more douchebaggy than suspected as he makes her feel guilty for even contemplating such a thing, even though it&#39;s 100% true.<br />Andie MacDowell later discovers that she was right, so goes immedately over to James Spader to make a video.<br />Douchebag husband finds out and freaks even more the fuck out, rushes over there, punches James Spader in the face and then watches the video.<br />In which Andie MacDowell starts talking abou herself, but ends up turning the tables on James Spader and finds out that among other things, he is a recovering pathological liar and that&#39;s why he distances himself from people.<br />Then the movie ends with douchebag husband getting a divorce and getting fired, Andie MacDowell and her sister beginning to patch up their relationship and Andie MacDowell and James Spader apparently being together now.<br /><br />This film is... ok, I guess. It&#39;s not bad, quite interesting. It just feels like there are bits missing. I mean, we&#39;re told that douchabag husband and James Spader were great friends, and we&#39;re further told that James Spader has changed a lot, and douchebag husband no longer likes him, but you just can&#39;t <i>imagine </i>that they ever had anything in common. Just a little back story, some clue as to how they became friends or something would have rounded out the story. Also the 80s chewed up the movie and spat it out. And not it the good way<br /><br />Tattoo Watch: absent. I become incresingly amused at how many ways directors find to *not* shoot James Spader&#39;s upper right arm.<br /></lj-cut><br />"

"event","<p>So aside from Olympics fever, what else have I been up to?<br /><br />Well I had my first physio appointment for my knees yesterday and have various exercises that ought to do them some good. I&#39;ve also been off work sick the last couple of days. Just a bit of a stomach bug really. Nothing that&#39;s had me feeling too out of sorts, but the kind you don&#39;t want to pass on.<br />I probably could have gone to work today, but it was as well to be sure. Also it was Friday and neither my project lead nor my line manager were going to be in. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d have accomplished much anyway. I&#39;ve been feeling kind of bleh all day so was probably a good idea.<br /><br />Still, me not feeling too terrible means I have been able to watch TV. I watched the first episode of Accused that was on BBC1 on Tuesday, and it was just *desperately* sad and utterly compelling. Poor Sean Bean.<br /><br />And today I watched The Best of Men which is about the birth of the Paralympics and is funny, touching and just lovely and wonderful.<br /><br />But the reason I write this post so soon after the last is that last night I also watched:</p><br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""U.S. Marshals (1998)""><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120873/"">U.S, Marshals (1998)</a><br /><br /><img alt=""US Marshals"" border=""0"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/135656/original.jpg"" title=""US Marshals"" /><br /><br />This was on my list because Robert Downey Junior. And oh man, is it a great film. Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes spend most of the film trying to out badass each other and Robert Downey Junior has curtains. *CURTAINS*<br /><br /><br /><img alt=""Robert Downey Junior has curtains"" height=""200"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/135707/original.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" title=""Robert Downey Junior has curtains"" width=""296"" /><br /><br />The DVD described it as a &quot;Manhunt Thriller&quot; and I guess that&#39;s accurate. This film has more twists than... a twisty thing. So beware: Here Be Spoilers:<br /><br />The film opens on CCTV footage of some shit going <i>down</i> in a multi-storey car park. People get shot and we see someone has nicked some TOP SECRET files.<br /><br />Then we cut to a guy in a Land Rover type vehicle on a car phone (this is not especially relevant except it had me going &quot;car phone? CAR PHONE?!&quot; and scrambling to find out when the film was made). The important thing is he crashes into Wesley Snipes who is driving a tow truck. Wesley Snipes gets rescued from the wreck and taken to hospital and then the cops realise he was carrying a gun and fake papers. Things start to look fishy.<br /><br />Concurrently, Tommy Lee Jones is staking out some bad guys. Dressed a chicken. He notices them arrive and glares at them menacingly. Dressed as a chicken. He runs towards them and he and his team pile in to arrest them. Tommy Lee Jones is still dressed as a chicken. They then get into a massive fight with all of the bad guys and it looks like one of the guys has pulled a dick move by shooting one of the bad guys who wanted to comfort his baby, but it transpires there was a shotgun hidden in the cot, so you know, good call. Throughout it all Tommy Lee Jones remains dressed as a chicken. I know I am going on here, but Tommy Lee Jones <i>remains badass whilst dressed as a chicken.&nbsp; </i>This takes <i>skills.</i><br /><br />Then we see them celebrating in a bar, and it becomes clear that the team is a Rag Tag Bunch of Misfits. There&#39;s The Guy Who Looks Like One Of The Other Team In An 80s Buddy Cop Movie Complete With Moustache And Sports Jacket, The Young Nerdy One, The Brash New Jersey Type With No Dress Sense and The Sassy Black Woman. And Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />There is a conversation with his superior who is a lady female and it is broadly hinted that they are / have been / will be together at some point. It also transpires that Tommy Lee Jones is A Maverick because he might have done a police brutality on one of the bad guys. That that&#39;s ok because he was a bad guy and thus deserved it.<br /><br />Anyway, in penance, Tommy Lee Jones has to go an escort the prison plane that is taking a bunch of prisoners from Chicago to New York. This seems really odd to me, but I suppose such things must exist in a country as big as the US. Also on this flight is Wesley Snipes, who was arrested as soon as he was discharged from hospital and it was discovered his prints matched some found at a double homicide in New York.<br /><br />Wesley Snipes has managed to hide about his person the arm of a pair of glasses, which he then proceeds to use to unlock his cuffs. One of the other passengers turns out to secretly be an assassin and attempts to shoot him with a gun that had been hidden in the toilet roll holder of the plane. Wesley Snipes is too badass to be killed by mere bullets, however, and so the gun dude misses, and instead shoots out one of the windows of the plane. Obviously, the plane immediately begins to break up and people start getting sucked out. Luckily, the pilots manage to spot a long straight road to land on and do indeed bring the plane down. I am in the middle of congratulating them for badassery under pressure, when it becomes clear the danger isn&#39;t over yet. The wing of the plane catches on the power cables at the side of the road and breaks off and the plane catches fire. Just when you think it can&#39;t get any worse, they run out of road as it bends sharply to the right and so the plane rolls down the side of a cliff. To land upside down in a lake. At least that puts the flames out?<br /><br />I should perhaps have mentioned that, this being&nbsp;prison plane, all of the prisoners are shackled to the floor. Anyway, they are released and get out of the plane, the guards covering them with shotguns in case they attempt to escape. Tommy Lee Jones proves he is badass, caring and stupid by risking his life getting all of the prisoners out of the plane and later proves he can also look badass when wrapped in a patchwork quilt. In the confusion, Wesley Snipes escapes.<br /><br />The local hick sheriff is a little out of his depth with this manhunt, but it&#39;s all cool because Tommy Lee Jones is able to badass at them and get them working effectively until his team turns up and he can badass at them.<br /><br />Then some Government Agency turns up. DSS, apparently, which could stand for any one of at least 3 different US government agencies. Anyway, it turns out that the double homicide Wesley Snipes is wanted for is for two DSS or whatever agents and happened in the car park of the UN building.<br /><br />And thus Robert Downey Junior enters the scene. He as been seconded to Tommy Lee Jones in the hunt for Wesley Snipes, and even with his curtains, he is clearly way too cool to fit in with the Rag Tag Bunch of Misfits. But he also immediately starts flirting with Tommy Lee Jones because... I guess that&#39;s what you do. Whether I mean, &quot;what you do if you are Robert Downey Junior&quot; or &quot;what you do in response to meeting Tommy Lee Jones&quot; or both, I&#39;m not quite sure.<br /><br />Despite the flirting, it is also clear that he is By The Book. Which is obvious really, given the Misfits and Tommy Lee Jones&#39; status as A Maverick. He also appears to be Young and Keen.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones then handcuffs Robert Downey Junior because reasons... (I swear to god it made sense at the time and was nothing to do with Tommy Lee Jones being a kinky motherfucker) and Robert Downey Junior uses the same trick as Wesley Snipes did to escape. This may be taken as our first clue that All Is Not As It Seems.<br /><br />Then I get annoyed at everyone&#39;s lack of crime scene protocol. At least wear gloves you dolts!<br /><br />Wesley Snipes then takes a trucker and his wife hostage and forces them to drive. The wife is very clever and manages to subtly indicate to the cops who pull them over at a check point that all is not well, but Wesley Snipes is too badass to not notice and so he escapes in some exciting way.<br /><br />They realise he&#39;s gone and hidden in the swamps, so they all head out on swamp boats. Robert Downey Junior is allowed to look badass at last, again despite the curtains, because he is wearing a US Marshals vest and cap and looking ready for action. I am rather amused that the (blue) vest in question (of the bullet proof kind, for clarity) has a large white star in the centre of the chest. It is... reminiscent. It... reminds me of things.<br /><br />The one order Tommy Lee Jones gave his crew before they left was &quot;if you find him, stay in the boat and send up a flare.&quot; So of course the first thing that Robert Downey Junior does upon finding Wesley Snipes is to get out of the boat. He almost immediately gets taken hostage and has his gun taken from him. Which Wesley Snipes then uses to shoot Tommy Lee Jones as he comes charging to the rescue. But it&#39;s all ok, because Tommy Lee Jones was wearing a bullet proof vest and so is only bruised. However Wesley Snipes has escaped and is now armed.<br /><br />We then follow Wesley Snipes for a bit as he phones his girlfriend to protest his innocence and that he was in fact a Government Agent too and was Set Up.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Tommy Lee Jones has managed to get hold of the CCTV footage of the crime that Wesley Snipes had committed, and you will be shocked, I am sure, to discover that it is the footage we saw at the beginning of the film. From this Tommy Lee Jones notices two things: 1) Wesley Snipes shot the dudes in self defence, not cold blooded murder as he had been told and b) He was wearing leather gloves. <i>So how the hell did his prints get on the crime scene?!</i><br /><br />They confront Robert Downey Junior&#39;s boss and he confesses, yes they planted the prints. They had them on file because he was, indeed, a Government Agent, but he had Gone Rogue and was selling secrets to the Chinese. He (Robert Downey Junior&#39;s boss) hadn&#39;t told them (Tommy Lee Jones and the Misfits) before because it was hush hush and classified and all of that rot.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Wesley Snipes has got to New York, getting fake papers, money and a gun from his old handler (maybe) and protesting his innocence all the while. He manages to find an apartment that coincidentally looks over the UN Building and begins to stake the place out.<br /><br />Are you suspicious yet? I was suspicious. These did not seem to be the actions of a guilty man. These seemed to be the actions of a man desperate to clear his name. Tommy Lee Jones was suspicious. As well as Robert Downey Junior&#39;s boss&#39; evasion, he notices that Wesley Snipes seems to be going out of his way to not kill people, which seems somewhat at odds with the story of a traitor he is being told.<br /><br />Anyway, to cut a long story a little shorter, they track Wesley Snipes to New York and during a shoot out in a cemetery it transpires that Robert Downey Junior&#39;s boss is indeed a lying traitor and he set Wesley Snipes up to be the fall guy.<br /><br />He gets shot in the head by the Chinese Sniper Business Man Diplomat (did I not mention his involvement before? My bad. Basically he&#39;s the one being sold the secrets). And Wesley Snipes runs away again. They chase him into a retirement home and I, somewhat to my disappointment, become suspicious of Robert Downey Junior&#39;s motives. He seems just a *little* too trigger happy to just be glad to be taking the bad guy down. It seems like he <i>might </i>be trying to silence him before he can talk. Oh yeah, he is also wearing a hideous tie. Wide blue and green horizontal stripes. *shudders*<br /><br />Anyway, he tracks Wesley Snipes to a patient&#39;s room and Wesley Snipes leaps down on him from the ceiling. Because. He is Wesley Snipes and he is that badass. They fight for a bit and then The Nerdy One from The Misfits bursts in on them and so Robert Downey Junior shoots him in the chest. Because reasons of him being Evil. And a Traitor. Possibly The Nerdy One Heard Too Much. I can&#39;t remember. His motives made sense at the time. Of course, Tommy Lee Jones bursts in, is told Wesley Snipes shot the kid and gives chase. Wesley Snipes out badasses Tommy Lee Jones for perhaps the first time in this movie by swinging from the roof of a building on a cable onto the roof of a train station below, and then jumps from there onto a moving train.<br /><br />The Nerdy One dies, so Robert Downey Junior&#39;s secret is safe. For now. They track Wesley Snipes to a cargo ship and he and Tommy Lee Jones have a fight in... sand? Gravel? Unpopped popcorn? It is unclear. Anyway, Wesley Snipes gets hold of Tommy Lee Jones&#39; gun and is about to shoot him when Robert Downey Junior shoots him from a distance. Several times. And the look on his face is... not pleasant. Also two things are clear: a) He didn&#39;t care much about Tommy Lee Jones. At that distance there was a real chance of hitting him instead. 2) He wanted the motherfucker <i>dead.</i><br /><br />Unfortunately, he must have gone to the Stormtrooper Academy of Marksmanship, because despite shooting him 3 or 4 times, Wesley Snipes is not dead. Or possibly he is a vampire and can&#39;t be killed by mortal bullets...<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones is suspicious of Robert Downey Junior who proves they are founded when he takes the first opportunity to get into Wesley Snipes hospital room and confess that he was basically behind the whole thing before attempting to finish what he started. Luckily Tommy Lee Jones turns up in time to shoot Robert Downey Junior, who is not a vampire and thus dies.<br /><br />Finally, Wesley Snipes&#39; name is cleared and he can live a normal life (ignoring the countless crimes he committed whilst on the run. Sure he never killed anyone, but he took people hostage and stole and shot at people)<br /><br />So what do I think of this film? You&#39;ve read the plot. The plot is damn silly. But there is some class talent in it, and they put in some great performances. Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes basically spend the entire time trying to out badass each other, and Robert Downey Junior is great, coming across at first as this Green Rookie, anxious to please, but with this ruthless side that flicks out and back like a cat&#39;s claw and becomes more obvious as the film continues and your suspicions are raised. And The Misfits are all great too.<br /><br />It occurred to me about the point where I was beginning to be suspicious of Robert Downey Junior&#39;s character that it was just the kind of role I could imagine James Spader playing, but I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d have believed his innocence so readily if he had.<br /><br />All in all, a fun film, raised from mediocrity by great acting.<br /></lj-cut>"

"event","<p>Before I start this, I have a confession to make: I am an Olympics fan.</p><p></p><br /><lj-cut text=""...I love you...""><br /><p>Not a newly converted fan, neither. My love affair with the Olympics began in 2004. My dad had just had a double hernia operation, so was basically recuperating in a chair in the living room for most of the summer. I was 15 or so, on my summer holidays, no job, so I used to go and keep him company. And, so we watched a lot of the Olympics.</p><p></p><p>And that&rsquo;s when I discovered that, to quote John Finnemore; &ldquo;watching humans do difficult things astoundingly well is quite good fun after all&rdquo;.</p><p></p><p>(By the way, check out his Now Show Live bit on falling in love with the Olympics. Because it is true.)</p><p></p><lj-embed id=""43""/><br /><p>I love that there is two weeks every four years where I passionately care about sport. Of suddenly caring about the taekwondo or the fencing or the men&rsquo;s double trap for a day, and within half an hour becoming an expert on that sport. Of shouting at the TV. Of wanting people I&rsquo;ve never heard of to do well because they come from the same country as me, or because they are giving it their best and trying hard.</p><p></p><p>So, unlike a lot of people, I was looking forward to the Olympics. I was one of the few who didn&rsquo;t think the British presentation at Beijing was utterly awful, I thought it was quirky and individual and humorous and very British; an indicative counterpoint to the well regimented conformity of the admittedly spectacular Chinese ceremonies. And so I was even looking forward to the Opening Ceremony.</p><p></p><p>So is this the point that I turn to all of you ex-doubters, you newly converted Olympics fans and say &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo;</p><p></p><p>No. Because this Olympics surpassed all of my wildest dreams. I am, after all, still British. I was looking forward to the sport. I was not expecting the atmosphere to be electric everywhere. I was looking forward to catching the highlights after work. I was not expecting to be spending the day with live streams as I was working because I couldn&rsquo;t bear to miss it. I was looking forward to watching Team GB to quite well in boats and on the cycling track. I was not expecting the storm of sporting excellence tat came. I was looking forward to a mildly amusing, somewhat entertaining Opening Ceremony. I was not expecting a wry and spectacular celebration of everything that makes me proud to be British. And I certainly wasn&rsquo;t expecting the organisation and transport to go smoothly. I am British, after all.</p><p></p><p>Put quite simply, London 2012 blew me away.</p><p></p><p>Everything exceeded expectations. And now I sit here, two days after the games have finished, at something of a loss with what to do with myself. I have read retrospective after retrospective. Visited <a href=""http://mofarahrunningawayfromthings.tumblr.com/"">http://mofarahrunningawayfromthings.tumblr.com/</a> far too many times. Watched highlights shows, montages, interviews. Wondering how to fill the Olympics shaped hole in my life. In fact, so loath am I to let go of these amazing two weeks, that after I finish this post, I shall watch Bert and Dickie, a drama starring Matt Smith about rowers in the &rsquo;48 Olympics.</p><p></p><p>I didn&rsquo;t even go and see any of the events live, and whilst I regret not getting tickets a little, I&rsquo;m not sure it could have made me love the experience more.</p><p></p><p>And I am gutted, gutted that I am on a training course for the week that makes up the meat of the Paralympics, so not only is it unlikely I&rsquo;ll be able to go and see any, but I won&rsquo;t even get to have a surreptitious watch during the day.</p><br /></lj-cut><br /><p></p><p></p><p>There was a reason for this post before I started my love letter. It was quite a simple reason, and slightly at odds with my effusive praise of a moment ago. Or perhaps not. I am, after all, British. And so, throughout these games that I have loved, I have kept a record of all of the most ridiculous, nonsensical and downright bizarre things that I have heard commentators (and occasionally interviewed athletes say). I have missed many. There is a limit to how many sports I can watch simultaneously (two if I can give it my full attention, one if I am also supposed to be working).

"event","It&#39;s only been a little while since my last post, but in that time three things have happened.<br />1) My knee has continued with pain<br />2) I went to London<br />3) I caught Olympics Fever. Again.<br /><br />1) Yeah, so contrary to sod&#39;s law, my knee has been buggering painful for the last week. But at least it meant I was able to get a diagnosis. Which was? Wonky Kneecaps. I&#39;m not even kidding. I think it&#39;s called Patellar Tracking Disorder. Basically means my patella doesn&#39;t quite sit in its grooves right, so it rubs and causes pain. Both my knees suffer from the same thing, the right more than left. Besides pain, there are a couple of other symptoms like your knee randomly buckling and clicking and sliding of the kneecap that I also get occasionally. Hopefully, physiotherapy will sort me out. I had a telephone consultation yesterday, where the woman on the end of the line who I assume was qualified physiotherapist agreed with my doctor&#39;s diagnosis, and today they sent me a list of exercises to do. Have also been referred to see an actual physio at the hospital down the road, but of course that will take 4 or 5 weeks. For the particularly acute flare up I am suffering through right now, my doctor has prescribed me some anti-inflammatories, but they aren&#39;t having quite the desired effect. Taking the edge of the pain a little but not eliminating it, and for funsies, I am skipping tonight&#39;s dose because I was suffering stomach cramps this afternoon, and that is a potential side effect. Realised that I might have taken two doses a little too close together, so am giving tonight a skip to start again properly tomorrow. If I get pain again, then I guess it&#39;s back to the doctors. This made more sense when my stomach was hurting more than my knee, but there you go. Will also go back to the doctor if the pain hasn&#39;t eased by the weekend.<br /><br /><br />2)And this probably didn&#39;t help my knee, but I spend Saturday afternoon wandering around the Covent Garden / Leicester Square area. Had Ben&#39;s cookies, found the tiny cinema shop nearby, wandered around Forbidden Planet and bought comics and the first two Nikki Heat books (the Castle tie in books. Which, by the way, I have read both of and they are fantastic. They are not great books. They are not. But they are <i>perfect</i>. They are exactly what you can picture Castle writing. They draw on bits and pieces of the show, so you can see what inspired him to write what bits. You can see which bits are wish fulfilment. All in all, very clever). And then I went to see Rock of Ages. And guys, it was better than the film. You know how I raved about how much I loved the film? And how&nbsp; it was wonderfully mad and fantasically rocking? What I didn&#39;t realise was that <i>the film was taking itself seriously compared to the show.</i> Let me state that again. A film in which Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are the cutest couple, and Tom Cruise is a sexy, fucked up, mental rocker with a Baboon called Hey Man is the <i>serious</i> version. The show has no fourth wall installed. The act one finale ends with everyone doing Jazz Hands because the one character who is also the narrator read that that was what should be in the number in Breaking Into Acting for Dummies.<br />It is one of the funniest shows I have seen period. And it manages to have *<i>even more* </i>awesome music than the film. Also the plot is almost entirely different, but who cares about plot.<br />Also, Shayne Ward, he of winning the X-Factor about 7 years ago, is in it playing Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise&#39;s character), and you know what? He is <i>FANTASTIC</i>. Really great.It just makes me sad that Justin Lee Collins was having his day off. Because it was one of those casting choices that just made me go o_O and now I really want to see what he did with it.<br />Although the real star of the show is the guy playing Lonnie, the narrator / Russel Brand&#39;s character. Basically, he steals. Every. Single. Scene that he is in. And it. is. GLORIOUS.<br />Is it going to take a place in my top 3 all time favourite musicals? No. Would I pay to see it again? Hells to the YES!<br /><br />3) You don&#39;t have to know me very long to know I&#39;m not really a sporty person. Know me a bit longer and you discover my fondness for Rugby Union in general and the 6 Nations in particular. However, you have to be around me for a very specific two weeks every four years to discover that during the Summer Olympics I become something of a sports nut. I will track the British medal table daily. I will watch any sport where there is a Brit playing if there is even the slightest hope of a medal. I will briefly become an expert on whatever sport I am currently watching, and most importantly, I will become a store for pointless facts. This year, I have both the official 2012 app <i>and</i> the BBC olympics app on my phone. I check the schedules nightly to set reminders for every event the next day that a) will be awarding medals and b) has someone on Team GB competing. I have had various events on in the background whilst I have been working most of the day. And I have been staying up far too late to watch the daily round up.<br />It all started during the 2004 Athens Olympics when I was 15. That summer my dad had had a double hernia operation, and so was basically stuck sitting in a chair for about 6 weeks whilst he recovered. My brother was thus being looked after elsewhere, and I had bugger all to do, so I would go over as much as I could to keep him company. During this, the Olympics was on. And so, me and Dad watched a *lot* of Olympics. He was watching it every day, basically everything that was on, so would be able to tell me all the random facts about everything. And it was that year that sparked my interest. That was the year where I discovered, to paraphrase John Finnemore&#39;s fantastic bit on the subject on The Now Show Olympics Show, that watching people do anything exceptionally well is utterly brilliant.<br />Unapologetically, I will say I love the Olympics.<br />And then there was the Opening Ceremony. I think even the most cynical of people were thawed by that. It was one of the most wonderful, uplifiting, and simply fantastic events I have ever seen. A glorious celebration of everything that makes me proud to be British.<br />I think we dun good this time.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, on to the review!<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Hope Springs (2003)""><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314431/"">Hope Springs (2003)</a><br /><br /><img alt=""Hope Springs"" height=""200"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/134486/original.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" title=""Hope Springs"" width=""200"" /><br /><br />A film on my list because Colin Firth.<br /><br />Oh, but I did enjoy this film. It was very silly. Very light hearted. Very fun.<br /><br />My first inkling that I was in for a treat was the credits.Oliver Platt&#39;s name comes up, and he is always wonderfully watchable, if not downright hilarious in everything ever. And my faith was justified when he utterly stole almost every scene he was in.<br /><br />The film starts with Colin Firth on a plane, staring into nothing. He lands in New England. He gets on a Greyhound Bus. What follows perhaps the best &quot;being bored&quot; montage ever committed to film. It mostly involves Colin Firth pulling ridiculous faces.<br /><br />Turns out his fianc&eacute;e had been cheating on him, and the first he heard of it was when he received an invite to the wedding of his fianc&eacute;e and the guy she was cheating on him with.<br /><br />So the obvious response to that is to go to a tiny town in New England. He becomes something of an object of interest for all of the townsfolk because he is new and unusual.<br /><br />Did I mention he was an artist? He goes around drawing people and stuff. And his name is Colin.<br /><br />Then, inevitably, he falls in love with a woman in the town. Via montage. Including Colin Firth on a bouncy castle. And doing yoga.<br /><br /><br />And <i>then</i> his ex-fianc&eacute;e turns up. And it turns out she&#39;s not marrying someone else. She just decided to send him that invitation in nudge him into marrying her. Because that is a sensible and reasonable thing to do.<br /><br />Colin, utterly sensibly tells her to stuff it because what she did was frankly quite horrible and he&#39;s not getting back with her. Also he&#39;s fallen in love with someone else.<br /><br />Then inevitable miscommunication and hijinks ensue.<br /><br />The best thing about this film is not just that is very silly. It&#39;s that Colin Firth is very silly in it. It doesn&#39;t happen all that often. He&#39;s in comedies somewhat regularly, but normally he&#39;s serious in them, even the straight man. He doesn&#39;t very often get to be silly. Except in this.<br /><br /><img alt=""Colin With Scarf Nipple Tassles"" height=""200"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/134759/original.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" title=""Colin With Scarf Nipple Tassles"" width=""200"" /><br />Example: this is from a scene in which he dances across the room using the scarf as nipple tassles.<br /><br />A ridiculous film.

"event","Told you I&#39;d get to review a few more over the summer. Although as I start to type this, its is quarter to 8, or 25 minutes before the Olympic Opening Ceremony starts, so who knows when I&#39;ll get round to finishing it. I know all the cool kids are cynical about the Olympics, but I shall be watching the Opening Ceremony with pleasure because a) I am genuinely looking forward to it and b) one of my work friends is in it.<br /><br />This week has been a good week. Mostly. Actually, what it mainly was was yesterday was damn fine, and the rest of the week was average to poor.<br /><br />Yesterday was great. Got into work about 10 to 10, a little later than hoped for but not unreasonable. Did some work for about half an hour, then realised I had to submit some our project code for the internal release deadline at 11, so spent about 20 minutes merging code. At 11 we had a team brief that took almost an hour, then back to work again until 12.30, when we all knocked off early to go to a local pub for a company paid for BBQ for the afternoon. Lovely food. Lovely drinks (not provided) and an entirely pleasant afternoon sitting in the sun chatting with colleagues. I discovered that one guy has a Dalek cupboard in his house. No joke, when they were re-modelling, one of the specs they gave to the architect was it had to have room to house a Dalek. Which is kept almost entirely to surprise people as they exit the downstairs loo.<br /><br />Then, just after 5, we went back across town in order to go to a different pub where a couple of guys were having their leaving do. I&#39;m quite sad they are leaving, actually. We get on quite well and I would consider them work friends. They are part of the usual Friday pub lunch crew, so I&#39;ve spent more social time with them than a lot of other people in my office. They were two of the... biggest characters in the office and they place will be quieter without them. They have been there for years and are well known and liked so there was a good turn out, including quite a few people who had previously left the company, which meant I got to meet an ex-employee who has become the stuff of myth and legend, and discovered he is exactly as described.<br />Anyway a couple of hours there, we wandered down to a nearby curry house where the guys who were leaving very kindly paid for us to have a very fine curry, and thence off to another pub for one last round before I finally got home around midnight.<br /><br />So total tally for yesterday: Time doing actual coding: 1.5 hours. Time spent eating, drinking and generally relaxing with colleagues: 10.5 hours.<br /><br />As I said. Damn fine.<br /><br />Today was pretty meh in comparison, and the weather has been a lot more humid today, so I was quite glad it was over. Had a pretty decent driving lesson this evening but got rather hot and sticky doing so.<br /><br />Oh, and on Monday I buggered my right knee. I occasionally get twinges in it, that are painful for a day or so. I&#39;ve never quite worked out what sets it off, but it&#39;s been going on for 3 years or so. I have dubbed it (due to a slightly convoluted in joke) Sympathy Javert Knee. Anyway, Monday at choir, I was standing singing and something went twing. I can only imagine that I twisted it strangely somehow. It hurt a little more than normal, but I didn&#39;t think much of it. Anyway, it&#39;s Friday now and it&#39;s still hurting, so I&#39;m going to the Doctors on Tuesday. Sod&#39;s law says that it&#39;ll be fine by then, of course.<br /><br />And tomorrow, I am going to see Rock of Ages! I have an excite! I admit that going to London on the first Saturday of the Olympics was perhaps not my smartest move, but by golly am I looking forward to it!<br /><br />And speaking of the theatre, I think I have convinced my mum to see Shakespeare by the power of ranting.<br />When I was home last I mentioned that I wanted to go and see Henry V at The Globe and was trying to find people to go with me. I was somewhat surprised when my mum said that she&#39;d join me. Shakespeare is really not her thing. She&#39;ll go to the occasional musical, but she doesn&#39;t share my love of theatre.<br />What she has had, however is the... pleasure of being subjected to my rants on the subject of how I love Shakespeare and think it is a terrible shame that so many people are put off by school, and how if you just see it acted, you see it come alive and so on and so forth. And I think, I <i>think </i>I might have convinced her to give it a go.<br /><br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Withnail &amp; I (1987)""><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094336/"">Withnail &amp; I (1987)</a><br /><br /><br /><img alt=""Withnail &amp; I"" height=""159"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/133979/original.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" title=""Withnail &amp; I"" width=""150"" /><br /><br />There are films that if you mention you haven&#39;t seen them, people looked at you as if you&#39;ve personally insulted them. Withnail &amp; I is one of them. I actually borrowed the DVD off a colleague and I&#39;ve had it for an *aaaaaage* and finally got round to it. I liked it. It&#39;s not going on to my list of favourite films, but I enjoyed it a lot. I think perhaps I was not quite as in the mood for a meandering film as I thought as my attention did wander a bit in the middle. The thing that really struck me about the film was how *different* Richard E Grant and Paul McGann looked. I don&#39;t just mean they looked young, although they did, but they just look so *different*<br /><br /><img alt=""they look so young"" height=""126"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/134354/original.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" title=""they look so young"" width=""200"" /><br /><br />And Paul McGann just doesn&#39;t suit short back and sides.<br /><br />Although the thing that really <i>really</i> got to me about the film, having just completed a rewatch of Life on Mars, is that Danny, the stoner drug dealer dude, is played by Ralph Brown, who <i>also </i>played DCI Frank Morgan. Just think on that. I can&#39;t quite wrap my head around it.<br /><br />So. Yes. I can see why it a perennial student favourite. Good film.&nbsp;<br /></lj-cut><br /><br />"

"event","<p>Goodness, what a jolly long time it&#39;s been since I did one of these.<br /><br />Why has it been so long? Honestly, no real reason. Just, I&#39;ve not really got round to it. Over the years I&#39;ve amassed quite the collection of TV shows I watch on a regular basis and between that and work and driving lessons and occasionally having a social life and travelling and everything, my love film watching has fallen by the wayside somewhat.<br /><br />But now it is summer hiatus, and this leaves me with a little more free time with which to indulge. Of course, the observant of you will have noticed that summer hiatus began a while back, so why has it taken so bally long to do this one? (forgive me, I&#39;ve been reading Jeeves and Wooster fic just now)<br /><br />Well, see what I have been doing is mostly aquiring new fandoms. You&#39;re surprised I can tell.</p><br /><lj-cut text=""Hawaii Five-0""><br /><p><br />First new fandom was Hawaii Five-0. The remake. They had a cross over episode with NCIS LA this season and that combined with the recommendations of several people that it was ridiculous in the good way and slashtastic as fuck was enough to convince me to give it a try. And, yeah, I watched the first two seasons in fairly short order. And yes, it is a damn ridiculous show about a special taskforce of 4 people in Hawaii who go around solving crime and not worrying about admissibility of evidence. Seriously, their interrogation techniques leave something to be desired. A colleague described it as being to NCIS LA what NCIS LA is to NCIS, and I have to agree. Less plot, more explosions and more emphasis on pretty mens. And ladies for those so inclined.<br /><br />And it takes place in Hawaii. Which means surfing. Which means beaches. Which means high probability of this happening:</p><p><img alt=""Steve.

No. Try again. This is Danny"" width=""200"" /></p>So&hellip; yeah. Now I have this to help balance out the more serious and gritty crime shows I watch.&nbsp; Which I think brings my total up to about 6. But hey, at least Silent Witness only airs about 8 episodes a year&hellip;<br /><br />Unusually for me, it hasn&#39;t made me particularly inclined to go and check out the orignial. Not sure why.<br /><br /></lj-cut><br /><br />My second new fandom has blindsided me rather. I went to see Rock of Ages a couple of weekends back with a couple of friends thinking it would be quite an entertaining couple of hours. I now have the soundtrack, have compiled a playlist of original tracks and am going to see the West End show in a few weeks. And may have spent part of today&rsquo;s sick day watching a very dodgy quality extra legal version because my local cinema isn&rsquo;t showing it any more and I require rocking out occasionally.<br /><lj-cut text=""Rock of Ages"">When I first heard about the movie I was&hellip; not psyched. It was a jukebox musical after all. An excuse to hamfistedly string together some tracks that follow some theme and appeal to the populist masses with overblown tripe and make a tonne of money despite being devoid of artistic merit. (Yeah, I am a bit of a theatre snob. This surprises you? I have strongly held opinions of people who arrive after the curtain, I think that if we must have a televised &ldquo;search for a star&rdquo; show, <i>must</i> it be on ITV?, and I firmly believe that Shakespeare is perfectly accessible and people who claim not to like it just haven&rsquo;t given it a chance.)<br /><p>And then I caught Russell Brand on Graham Norton and conceded the film looked fun, so was perfectly willing to give it a go when it was suggested.</p><p>And yeah. I got hooked. I loved the film. I got the soundtrack stuck in my head for days. In fact, in the last week, I have almost exclusively switched between listening to the OST and my own playlist. Turns out I love 80s Hair Metal a lot more than I thought I did.</p><p>And yes, the plot is stupidly predictable and the characters are all one dimensional.&nbsp; And jeez, would it kill you have just <i>one</i> female character who has some sort of reason for being that isn&rsquo;t to advance the plot of the male characters?</p><p>But hey, the character motivations may be paper thin, but at least they are always pretty obvious and make some sort of sense, and there are no particularly gaping plot holes, so it is a step up from Prometheus!</p><p>The cast rocks out pretty well, and all seem to be enjoying the fuck out of themselves. Especially Catherine Zita-Jones.</p><p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve tried to work out why I like this film so much and I think I&rsquo;ve boiled it down to 3 things:</p><p><b>1.Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand.</b></p><p>Ok, so I&rsquo;m not as anti-Russell Brand as a lot of people seem to be. I think he&rsquo;s better at his job than a lot of people give him credit for, and when he actually bothers to try is a *very* funny comedian. In fact, I saw him on his last tour at the O2, and very much enjoyed it. This is mostly because the show focussed on what he does best: taking the media apart piece by piece. Especially when applied to himself. And the segment where he applied the same to the death threats he had received after hosting some awards show in America was truly hilarious. And yes, he is also loud and crude and has entirely too high an opinion of himself, but he can be funny and charming if he wants to be.</p><p>And Alec Baldwin? Well he&rsquo;s never really appeared on my radar before now. When I think of him, the phrase &ldquo;kind of a douche&rdquo; springs to mind, but I honestly couldn&rsquo;t tell you <i>why</i>.</p><p>My point, that I am eventually getting to, is that of all the words I would use to describe either of them, the word &ldquo;cute&rdquo; is absolutely not one of them.</p><p>And yet, the two of them together flips the cute switch in my brain. They have the best duets, whether it&rsquo;s singing into a hairbrush to I Love Rock and Roll or the hilariously sappy and over blown Can&rsquo;t Fight This Feeling.</p><p>I think it provides one of the funniest and most emotionally warm moment of the whole film.</p><p><b>2) Tom Cruise</b></p><p>Again, if I was going to describe Tom Cruise I&rsquo;d go with &ldquo;short&rdquo;, &ldquo;batshit insane&rdquo; and ... I&rsquo;m not sure really, I think that covers all bases. I&rsquo;ll go with &ldquo;unexpectedly funny at times.&rdquo; Tropic Thunder, anyone?</p><p>And again, you&rsquo;ll notice that a word that is missing from that list is &ldquo;attractive&rdquo;.</p><p>And then, in this film, he looks like this:</p><p><img alt=""stacee jaxx does weird things to my brain"" height=""270"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/132736/original.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" title=""stacee jaxx does weird things to my brain"" width=""200"" /></p><p>And this:<br /><img alt=""Tom Cruise should not do weird things to my brain"" height=""290"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/133051/original.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" title=""tom cruise should not do weird things to my brain"" width=""200"" /></p><p>And, quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t quite know what do with myself.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not just the look, it&rsquo;s the whole thing. He *owns* the rock star persona in this film. Strutting about the stage, I was about to say making love to the audience, but no, <i>fucking </i>the audience hard and fast whilst he&rsquo;s on stage and they&rsquo;re down there in the arena and <i>knowing </i>that they love it. He&hellip; sells it. And my brain finds that hard to compute.</p><p>Of course, he has the other part of the rock star thing down pat to. The crazy part. The &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done so many drugs I honestly couldn&rsquo;t tell you if I&rsquo;m high or just insane right now&rdquo; part. It leads me too the slightly meta question of how much of that is really Tom Cruise? Is he simply a better actor than I give him credit for? Or has he managed to channel his own brand of crazy wonderfully into the character of Stacee Jaxx?</p><p>Either way. It works. And it shouldn&rsquo;t. Probably because on top of all of this, boy can sing. I mean, you know, I don&rsquo;t expect him to be releasing any albums soon, but he has the rock voice to do justice to Bon Jovi and Def Leppard. Although I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be many music buffs queuing up to disagree with me on that point.</p><p>Which brings us on to finally, finally, the very greatest reason why I love this film:</p><p><b>3) The music</b></p><p>What can one say? We&rsquo;re talking about a soundtrack comprised of Pat Benetar, Poison, Whitesnake, Foreigner, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and Journey, among others.</p><p>There are just some damn fine songs in the film. Songs you can&rsquo;t help but get your rock on to. I have had some of the finest ear worms in the last week or so. During my driving lesson just now, I spent a large amount of it with Rock You Like A Hurricane in the back of my mind. And I&rsquo;ve possibly made my neighbours sick of the sound of Wanted Dead Or Alive. Not that I think that is possible.</p><p>And, best of all, it finishes with Don&rsquo;t Stop Believing, which as well as being a damn fine song, is bound up with some very good memories. It always makes me think of The Losers which not only was another great, fun film, as well as being the film that convinced me that maybe, just maybe Chris Evans could be Cap, but it was also the first film I saw after handing in my dissertation, a film that all my friends had seen the week before, but I&rsquo;d had to cry off because of the aforementioned dissertation and had been told I *had* to see. So it&rsquo;s intimately bound up with that feeling of relief and freedom of finally being done with it all.</p><p>So yeah, this song brings it all back and I love it.</p><p>I shouldn&rsquo;t like this film, but I do. I even find Russell Brand&rsquo;s surreal and improbably wandering accent charming instead of annoying. Seriously though, I think he was aiming for Brummie, which he hits maybe 1 sentence in 10. The rest of the time it meanders between there and his natural accent. And he sings with an American accent, just to make it even more jarring. But still. I am charmed.</p><p>All in all, it&rsquo;s just a fun film. Not a good film, not by any stretch of the imagination. But it turns out I will forgive a film many things for appropriate use of Journey.</p><p>As those who follow me on Twitter will know, the appropriate use of Journey is &ldquo;in order to rock the fuck out&rdquo;.</p><br /></lj-cut><br /><p></p><p></p><p>And my final new fandom did the opposite of blindside me. It&rsquo;s something I knew, I hoped, I <i>prayed</i> I would like. &nbsp;I talk of course of Aaron Sorkin&rsquo;s new show, The Newsroom. And I&rsquo;m calling it. 10 minutes into the second episode I called it. Officially, I love the show.</p><br /><lj-cut text=""The Newsroom""><br /><p></p><p>It&rsquo;s about a news anchor (Jeff Daniels) who is popular because he stays neutral rather than expressing an opinion and thus never offends anyone. He is then pressed into answering the question &ldquo;What makes America the best country in the world&rdquo; and&nbsp; has a somewhat spectacular meltdown as he explains, in great detail, why that question is based on a faulty assumption. The network brings in a new Exec Producer, who also happens to be his ex and she has this radical idea: news should not be about entertainment. It should not care about ratings. It should not care about demographics. It should inform. It should explain. It should credit its viewers with a little intelligence.</p><p>And basically, the show is about them trying to do just that.</p><p>I can only describe it as a cross between The West Wing and Sports Night, but with HBO language*.&nbsp; It has the more idealistic tone of The West Wing but is lighthearted and, as it is about putting on a daily news show, it has a very similar energy and pace as Sports Night.</p><p>Which is good, really, as they are my two favourite Sorkin shows.</p><p><span style=""font-size:smaller;"">*HBO language: when everyone swears all the time to show how grown up they are. Actually, that&rsquo;s a disservice, it&rsquo;s not *gratuitous*, it just comes as a surprise after being so used to watching shows where you would <i>never</i> hear the word fuck.</span></p><p>Another great thing about it being on HBO is longer episodes. The first one was 1hr 15 and the second a full hour. More space to tell the story, more character development, more Sorkin dialogue.</p><p>And I love his way with dialogue. There is a rhythm and cadence to the way he uses words that is, quite simply, stunning. It manages to simultaneously sound like real people talking and have a gorgeous melody that washes into you. You can tell he likes language for language sake and I&rsquo;m sure the reason so many of his characters are writers is so that he can play.</p><p>Of course, it being Sorkin, it is very much an Author Tract, although, I think he, like David E Kelley, never lets character and plot take a backseat for too long when he does so. But as with all these things, I think it is much easier to forgive and ignore when you agree with the views being espoused, and as I do, I don&rsquo;t much care.</p><p>Also, it being Sorkin, I already have 2 conflicting ships. And a third which has already been upgraded to &ldquo;like burning&rdquo; on the How-Much-To-I-Ship-It-O-Meter.</p><p>And this has also made me realise that yes, yes indeed, 101 Dalmations did make me have a little bit of a crush on Jeff Daniels, and no, no it hasn&rsquo;t gone away. So there&rsquo;s that&hellip;</p><p>And OMG, I&rsquo;ve only just realised why Mackenzie, the EP, looked so familiar. She was Nina in Bright Young Things which may just very well be my most favouritest film of all time.</p><br /></lj-cut><br /><p></p><p><br />Anyway, I have burbled on for far, far too long already. Time to get to the review.</p><br /><lj-cut text=""Deception (2008)""><br /><p></p><p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800240/"">Deception (2008)</a></p><p><img alt=""Deception"" height=""256"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/133177/original.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" title=""Deception"" width=""200"" /></p><p>So, this was on my list because Ewan McGregor. Somehow the fact that Hugh Jackman was also in this film managed to pass me by and made for a pleasant surprise when I put it on.</p><p>It was&hellip; alright. The first 10 minutes were good. Then the middle half hour was boring as hell. Then the next forty minutes are pretty interesting. And then in the final 20 minutes, you keep expecting the film to end and it doesn&rsquo;t. I swear there are, like, 6 different plot twists in that time.</p><p>First of all, I do like to try and judge a film based on what other films it advertises on the DVD. This one&hellip; did not fill me with hope. First up was that film where Peter Petrelli was a potentially evil doctor who went round killing scumbags. Or something. I only remember it at all because it was called something like Pathology and when I saw the trailer at the cinema, it was what first made me start to believe that there were no good film titles left. That they had all been used up.</p><p>And the second was a film where Nic Cage was a hitman. And it did not look to be a good Nic Cage movie.</p><p>So the movie opens with Ewan McGregor in glasses, sporting what I can only describe as &ldquo;dweeb hair&rdquo;, you know, that sort of combed over look that in Hollywood immediately denotes you are terribly uncool. He is an accountant who goes around auditing different company&rsquo;s accounts. He is working late in an office block, in a conference room.<br /><br /><img alt=""Ewan McGregor's Dweeb Hair"" border=""0"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/133588/original.jpg"" title=""Ewan McGregor's Dweeb Hair"" /></p><p>Hugh Jackman arrives. He is a lawyer. He is immediately suave and cool. They hit it off. Hugh Jackman produces a joint and they proceed to get high in the conference room. Because that&rsquo;s what you do with someone you just met. My twitter feed tells me that this happens 4 minutes into the film.</p><p><img alt=""Hugh Jackman is suave yo"" border=""0"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/14211227/133767/original.jpg"" title=""Hugh Jackman is suave yo"" /></p><p>It is somewhat amusing that they are both playing Americans. Their accents aren&rsquo;t bad, it&rsquo;s just kinda obvious that it is neither of their natural accents. They blend fine with actual American accents, but when it&rsquo;s just the two of them it notices.</p><p>Anyway, they bump into each other the next day, and Hugh invites Ewan to go and play tennis. Which they do and mmmtenniswhites&hellip;. Whut? Ahem, yes, so then in the locker room talk immediately turns to sex because reasons. And then they go to a strip club. Well. First they go back to Hugh&rsquo;s place so that Ewan can borrow a suit. *Then* they go to the strip club.</p><p>After that they meet up for lunch and contrive to swap phones. And that just makes me wonder how often that actually happens. I mean, it&rsquo;s rare that I have the same phone as someone else, let alone not notice if I picked up the wrong one.</p><p>So, it happens, and it also turns out that Hugh Jackman has had to fly to London, so by the time Ewan McGegor notices he is long gone.</p><p>Ewan McGregor then starts to get&hellip; interesting&nbsp; phonecalls on Hugh Jackman&rsquo;s phone.</p><p>Turns out Mr Jackman is part of a sex club called The List. Basically, you have a list of anonymous numbers, you call someone up, ask if they&rsquo;re free. If they are, you arrange to meet up at a hotel and have sex. Instigator pays for the room, no names, no conversation etc.</p><p>And then Ewan McGregor meets up with lots of different women and has lots of sex and this is the point where my attention started to wander and I wasn&rsquo;t really paying much attention, and who would have thought a film with lots of naked Ewan McGregor would be boring?</p><p>He hooks up with a girl, they hit it off. They start meeting outside the rules. I consider turning off the film and trying to watch it another day. And then (and this is mostly what I picked up on later) they go to meet up, Ewan finds, instead of the girl, an empty room with a lot of blood and then gets hit over the head. When he comes to he calls the police, but they don&rsquo;t exactly take him seriously as he doesn&rsquo;t know her real name, or where she lives or anything and someone cleared up the blood.</p><p>It was around this point I started paying attention again.</p><p>So, turns out Hugh Jackman has taken the girl and if Ewan every wants to see her alive again, he needs to follow his instructions and do a little creative accounting to steal some money from the bank he is auditing.</p><p>Ewan does some investigating and discovers that Hugh Jackman is not who he says he is. He was never a lawyer for that firm, he never lived in that apartment, and it&rsquo;s not his real name. So Ewan tells him to stuff it, and then a woman matching the girl&rsquo;s description turns up dead, but it&rsquo;s not her, but serves to a) make the police suspect Ewan and b) makes him decide to do go through with it.</p><p>However he knows Hugh&rsquo;s real name and is pretty sure Mr Jackman is going to kill him for it. So he transfers the money, and heads out. Hugh Jackman has rigged his apartment to blow up and it does so, looking like a gasleak. A body is pulled from the wreckage. The movie seems like it is going to end. <i>(Ending 1)</i></p><p>Cut to Hugh Jackman dressing himself like Ewan and getting on a plane to Madrid where is going to pick up the money. He gets chatting to a guy and it is strongly implied that this guy will be his next victim. The movie seems like it is going to end. <i>(Ending 2)</i></p><p>Hugh Jackman gets to Madrid, where he meets up with the girl from earlier, and it turns out they&rsquo;d been in it together all along. She expresses misgivings and horror at Ewan McGregor being killed because she genuinely liked him, but Hugh Jackman shrugs it off like the sociopath he is. They go to collect the money. The movie seems like it is going to end. <i>(Ending 3)</i></p><p>However, there is a hold up, as there is a second signatory required on the account. Turns out that Ewan McGregor is a canny lad, and whilst he was transferring the money, added a second signatory to the account, himself. He turns up and demands half the money. Hugh Jackman, being rather over a barrel, agrees. They get the money and walk out of the bank. The girl has disappeared. The movie seems like it is going to end. <i>(Ending 4)</i></p><p>They walk into a slightly secluded park, Ewan explains how he realised that Hugh Jackman and the girl were in it together, and offers half of his share to Hugh Jackman for telling him where she is. Hugh Jackman pulls out a gun and threatens Ewan McGregor to get all the money. The girl turns up and shoots Hugh Jackman in the stomach before she can. And then runs off. Ewan McGregor leaves the money with a dying Hugh Jackman in the park. Close up on Mr Jackman as he dies. The movies seems like it is going to end. <i>(Ending 5)</i></p><p>Cut to Ewan McGregor as he catches up with the girl. They are seen walking into a town square together. Finally, <i>finally</i> the movie ends. <i>(Ending 6)</i></p><p>So, yeah. A not entirely terrible film. But dear god, it goes on at the end. And the middle is just boring. Distinctly Average.</p><br /></lj-cut><br /><p></p><p></p>"

I would be ranting about this on Twitter, but my dad follows me on there now, and I don't want this to ruin my day.<p>&nbsp;</p>Dad and everyone are coming to visit me today. Originally, their text said they would come ""late morning"". So, having spent all day yesterday cleaning (not that I mind that too much, as my flat really did need a proper clean) I get up this morning, tidy up a few last bits, and settle down to wait. Then, not five minutes ago (about 20 to 12), I get a phone call telling me they haven't left yet, but they'll let me know when they do. <p>&nbsp;</p>It's a 2 hour drive if you don't hit traffic. So, late morning has turned into mid afternoon, and instead of the day I was looking forward to spending with my family, I get a handful of hours. The half formed plans I had of what we could do kind of go out of the window, and I've been waiting for the last two hours for nothing. <p>&nbsp;</p>I wouldn't mind, but if they'd just *told* me earlier, then I could have adjusted my plans. I could have planned to do something this morning. Ok, I probably wouldn't have done, but it would have been nice to *know*.<p>&nbsp;</p>Oh, and they want to go for lunch when they get here. So I can't eat for a couple of hours.<p>&nbsp;</p>*sigh* As I said, I want to enjoy this time with my family, so I'm gonna try and shake this pissed off before they get here.

"event","So what has occurred since last I posted?<br /><br />Well, my father continues to follow me on twitter, but I tend to forget until he mocks me for spelling / grammar errors, so really, it could be much worse.<br /><br />I have had a series of awesome weekends. First I was in Cardiff, and that was just great, as it always is.&nbsp; I need to retreat to my geek space every so often, and it always just makes me feel better, seeing everyone. Even though I got far too little sleep, a fact I have only really just caught up on. But the lack of sleep was important! Because me and <lj user=""bethan_b_bad"" /> got to introduce <lj user=""plum177"" /> to the wonders of The Mrs Bradley Mysteries. For those of you who don&#39;t know, this was a very short lived series of murder mysteries set in the 20s starring Dame Diana Rigg as Mrs Bradley and Neil Dudgeon as her chauffeur George, and it was on when I was about 10. It&#39;s always great when you can go back and find things you loved as a kid, and they turn out to be as good as you remember. Even better when you can introduce someone new to them, and they love it too. It was this show, I think, that started my fascination with the 1920s. It was probably my gateway drug to Agatha Christie as well. Watching it back, I&#39;m not sure <i>how</i> I ended up watching it, because there were only 5 episodes ever, and its not really my parent&#39;s cup of tea, but nevertheless, it ended up being the show I was allowed to stay up and watch as a special treat. It was also the first show I remember watching mostly because I shipped characters in it. Because I shipped Mrs Bradley and George <i>like burning.</i> I still do. It&#39;s kind of impossible to watch the show and not. And there seems to be one person on the <i>ENTIRE INTERNETS</i> that writes it. I mean, what?!<br /><br />Anyway, that was a rather unexpected side note. My second awesome weekend was when 6 old friends from home came up to visit. The original plan was they would come up, we&#39;d wander about the town, go out for dinner, then find a pub to while away the hours in. But this was the weekend it snowed, and we all decided it was far too cold to go out, so we ordered pizza and stayed in the flat drinking and chatting. It was a really nice catch up, and we proved it was in fact possible to sleep 6 people on my floor, relatively comfortably. Not something I would have guessed.<br /><br />Then last weekend I went home to see one set of parents and had a fake!Birthday which involved presents and cards and cake and going to a world buffet in Staines that my stepdad had been dying to show me, which was very nice, but nevertheless, involved going to Staines.<br /><br />So that was the other thing that happened to me, I turned 23. I am now the same as as my mother was when she had me, and if that isn&#39;t a weird thought, I don&#39;t know what is. It was the oddest birthday I have thus far had, as it is the first I have spent both a) in work, and b) away from all of the people I care most about; my family, and my closest friends.(Last year I took my birthday off and stayed with parentals, you see) But I went out for dinner and a couple of drinks with some of the other grads from my office, so it could have been worse.<br /><br />And it was greatly improved by what happened the night before. On the Sunday I was travelling back from my mother&#39;s when a friend of mine put the word out across twitter that they had ended up with a spare ticket for Noises Off on Monday night. I spent about 5 minuted deliberating about whether I should go, as it meant missing choir for the third week in a row, but then I realised, <i>it was Noises Off.&nbsp; </i>I love the show, it is one of the funniest plays I have ever seen, so there was no way I couldn&#39;t go. And so I did. And it was brilliant. By the time the curtain fell I was <i>physically exhausted</i> from laughing so much. That is the sign of a good show, I think you&#39;ll agree :) I kind of want to see it again now.<br /><br />And the final thing of interest is that I got a new phone! It is <i>amazeballs</i>. It was so weird. One Friday at work I was complaining that it was at least another 6 weeks before I could upgrade, which was close enough for me to keep thinking &quot;I can upgrade soon&quot; but far enough away to still be a long wait. Not three hours later, I got a call from my provider, asking me if I&#39;d like to upgrade early! Ended up getting a much better phone than the one I was hoping for, and it arrived on the following Monday. V happy all round, really.<br /><br />So anyway, on with the latest LoveFilm film.<br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""I, Witness (2003)""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329216/"">I, Witness (2003)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000kbzbx/""><img alt="""" height=""150"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000kbzbx"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;"" width=""150"" /></a><br /><br /><br />So, this was on my list because James Spader. And it was... eh. You know those films that are good, that you enjoy watching, but once you&#39;ve seen them once, you have no urge or desire to see it again. It&#39;s one of those films. Also, I don&#39;t know if I was too tired to follow the intricacies of the plot, or if there were subplots that never really went anywhere. Well... it wasn&#39;t so much that, as it was trying to make several Important Points at once and so they weren&#39;t all fully developed.<br /><br />So the film opens in Mexico. We know this because there are Mexican Flags everywhere. First of all, we see a group of men, women and children huddling into a tunnel. They reach the blocked end of the tunnel, and, surprised turn back towards the entrance, where a silhouetted figure stands, he shoots a couple and then the tunnel collapses. Then we cut to two teenagers on motorbikes in the desert. They are scrambler type bikes, and the kids have all the gear that suggests they do dirt racing regularly. One of them falls of his bike and then out of nowhere they are both shot and killed.&nbsp; This part feels very much like the cold open of an episode of Criminal Minds or maybe NCIS LA.&nbsp; Then we cut to Jeff Daniels (who will, no matter what else he does, be Roger from the 101 Dalmatians movie to me) with long hair and a beard check into a hotel. We discover he is from some sort of Human Rights Watch charity / program sort of thing, and he is there to oversee a local company having an vote on whether the workers want to unionise. Also we find out his name is James Rhodes which makes me giggle a little and spend the rest of the film waiting for him to be called Rhodey.<br /><br />Then the bodies in the tunnel are a discovered, and a young cop is given the job of discovering what happened to them. The young cop is played by Peter Andre Romulan from the new Star Trek movie. Also he looks a bit like Joseph Gordon-Levitt. At this point James Spader turns up. He is a US State Department Official or something and has *epically* bouffant hair.&nbsp; It looks all a bit Kevin Keegan and actually makes me wonder when this film is meant to be set. So far we&#39;ve not seen any obvious technology and not had a very clear look at the cars, and people&#39;s clothes have been pretty generic, so I start to wonder if it&#39;s supposed to be set in 70s. However, a bit later, that most reliable of ways of ageing movies, the mobile phone turns up and firmly plants the movie in the early 00s. Plus James Spader&#39;s hair calms down a little:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000kc8q8/""><img alt="""" height=""375"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000kc8q8"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;"" width=""500"" /></a><br /><br />Anyway the tunnels belong so a drug cartel, so the Police Captain decides they&#39;re responsible but Peter Andre Romulan Cop decides there&#39;s something fishy going on. Jeff Daniels decides to observe the investigation.Oh and is an old friend of James Spader.<br /><br />We then see a protest at the factory that is voting whether to unionise, and then the cops turn up in full riot gear, and what had previously been a relatively peaceful protest becomes violent. YAY Police brutality(!)&nbsp; Jeff Daniels is suspicious that the company has hired people to cause trouble to try and disrupt the vote.<br /><br />Oh and then James Spader is having sex with a lawyer who was introduced a couple of scenes previously. It&#39;s kind of pointless, and I&#39;m not sure if it supposed to set up that they are in a relationship or what, and just generally doesn&#39;t really add anything. Except that James Spader has to keep his arms above his head in a slightly unnatural position in order to hide his tattoo. Oh and to make scene later when the lawyer turns up at Jeff Daniels&#39; hotel room as he&#39;s getting out of the shower and them James Spader turns up and jumps to the obvious conclusion and there is a little awkwardness, but then that doesn&#39;t seem to go anywhere.<br /><br />The investigation continues, Jeff Daniels gets menaced by drug cartel members, James Spader is a bit of a bastard, or at least entirely focussed on doing his job by the book. Oh and the company basically intimidates people out of voting for a union by holding a verbal ballot, so everyone has to say in front of everyone else what they are voting for, but apparently this is legal.<br /><br />And then we get The D&eacute;nouement! I really can&#39;t be bothered to go into the intricacies of it, but it turns out the company and the police were responsible for all the deaths and trying to cover it up and pin the blame on the cartel. Jeff Daniels ends up working with the cartel in order to get the evidence to prove it, then they end up in a shoot out with the police, at which point Jeff Daniels&#39; Plot Armour fails him and he dies, but not before managing to pass on the vital evidence. And so the guilty people get arrested, Jeff Daniels is still dead, Peter Andre Romulan Cop and the lawyer look sad, and there is a vague implication she might have been falling for Jeff Daniels and James Spader stands at the back of his funeral looking a bit uncomfortable and then walks away and I decide it&#39;s possible that he and Jeff Daniels are exes. Because the goggles are welded on tight.<br /><br />So... yeah. I think the big problem with this film is it is very sure it has a Message, but it&#39;s not entirely sure what The Message actually is. But it probably has something to do with the way the US treats Mexico. But is it that unions are good? Is it that big corporations are evil? Is it that white Americans patronise the Mexicans? Is it that Mexico needs the US? Is it all of the above? It&#39;s just a little... confused... And I think had it focussed on the people trying to investigate the murders, it would have been a tight drama, and might even have had a more powerful message.<br /><br />In conclusion, a pretty interesting crime thriller, slightly ruined by the fact it&#39;s not quite sure what point it&#39;s trying to make. Tattoo watch: hidden :(<br /><br /></lj-cut><br />"

"event","It has been a for*age* since I last posted something that was not Horrible Histories squee.<br /><br />What has happened since then? Well, I still love Horrible Histories. A lot. Maybe even more than before.<br /><br />Just before Christmas I passed my driving theory test. With better marks than any of the practices I took. This should not be taken as an indication of the fact that I shall soon be taking my practical test. This should be taken as an indication of the fact that they were apparently changing the rules this year and I wanted to pass it before they did. I say this because I am getting a little fed up of people going on at me for not passing yet. As if there is an exact amount of time it is supposed to take. And that amount of time is precisely how long it took them. I haven&#39;t even been learning for a year yet, so I really don&#39;t think I&#39;m doing terribly. I got quite snappy at The Other Grad a couple of days ago because he said I &quot;should&quot; be taking my test next month. As if he knows how my driving is going better than me. As you might be able to tell, it got me a little. But seriously, learning to drive is like having a baby, *everyone* has advice, everyone has a story to tell and everyone wants to give you the benefit of their advice. And it gets wearing.<br /><br />But anyway, I passed and I was pretty psyched. And spent a nice Christmas and a quiet New Year with my family, and I caught up with friends as well.<br /><br />And just last week I bought myself an awesome new TV as a Birthday / Christmas present. I&#39;m a little bit in love with it.<br /><br />But most excitingly, I&#39;m going to be in Cardiff next weekend. w00t!<br /><br />Anyway, on with the review:<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Heart and Souls (1993)""><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107091/"">Heart and Souls (1993)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000k8h33/""><img alt="""" height=""330"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000k8h33"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;"" width=""220"" /></a><br /><br />So this film means there is apparently a subgenre of &quot;films about the afterlife starring Robert Downey Junior&quot;.&nbsp; But this is a ton more awesome and 0.0001% as Chances Are (the creepy-ass reincarnation film (lol, I just mentally moved the hyphen))<br /><br />So the film starts (in 1959, apparently) by introducing us to 5 sets of people. There&#39;s a Small Time Crook, who is having a very intense conversation with a mob boss. About stealing stamps. Small Time Crook feels bad cos they were worth loads of money, and he stole them off a kid to give to the mob boss. Because mob bosses can be philatelists too.<br />There is an Aspiring Actress who has moved to the Big City in order to Make It. (She may not be an Aspiring Actress. I may have mind that up. The point is she&#39;s moved to the Big City) She is currently working as a waitress. Her boyfriend comes to visit her from whatever Small Town they come from and demands that she stop keeping him hanging on, and decide if she&#39;s going to marry him. Cos it&#39;s been forever since she first moved out or something. She gets annoyed and chucks him or something. It&#39;s been a while. Anyway the point is, she breaks up with her boyfriend. A short while later, she realised she&#39;s Made a Mistake and runs after him.<br />The third is an Shy Singer. He has a lovely voice, but he goes to audition for the chorus in The Theatre but is too scared to sing. It is implied this is not the first time he failed.<br />The fourth is a Hard Working Black Mother who has several kids but she has to leave them in order to work her night job.<br />All of these four people end up on the same bus. The fifth set is a couple driving to the hospital to have a baby.<br />Then the bus driver is too busy perving on a couple getting it on in a car in the next lane so he drives the bus off a bridge and they all die. Bus Driver floats up into the sky, but all of the passengers are stuck on Earth.<br /><br />Cut to: About a year later, previously pregnant couple&#39;s house. Child is about a year old. All the dead people are hanging around. It is revealed they are somehow linked to this kid, and they can&#39;t move more than a few metres away. No one can see them but the kid. Oh, and over the past year they&#39;ve been able to work up a <i>sweet </i>A Capella sound.<br /><br />Cut to: The kid is about 6. And apparently, having 4 friends no one else can see, talking to them, arguing with them and working up complicated dance routines with them and insisting they are real makes your parents worry.&nbsp; Well that and letting the invisible people convince you into sneaking to the dog track and placing bets for them. Anyway, then the ghosts decide that it&#39;s better for the kid if he can&#39;t see them, say goodbye and make themselves invisible to him also. But they&#39;re still stuck around him.<br /><br />Cut to: The 80s. The kid is all grown up and Robert Downey Junior. He is a Cold Hearted Businessman. The ghosts aren&#39;t happy with the way their boy turned out. Anyway. The bus they all died on turned up and The Bus Driver tells them he&#39;s come to take them to heaven as they&#39;ve had enough time to Do What They Needed To Do. Turns out, no one told them that the reason they were stuck on earth was that they had unfinished business to complete and they were supposed to use the kid to do so. Oh yeah, and they could possess him in order to do it. And the bus driver has been condemned to drive the the Bus To Heaven for Eternity as punishment.<br />They plead with the Bus Driver and he agrees to give them some extra time. So they make themselves re-visible to RDJ. Who is... somewhat shocked as, to him, the hallucinations he had a child have come back.&nbsp; They convince him they&#39;re real. And to help them with their unfinished business.<br />The Small Time Crook gives the stamps back to the kid,<br />The Shy Singer possesses Robert Downey Junior&nbsp; and sings the national anthem at a concert.<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000k9tf0/""><img alt="""" height=""300"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000k9tf0"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;"" width=""400"" /></a><br />The Hard Working Black Mother finds out what happened to her kids and gets to possess Robert Downey Junior in order to hug her now grown up son.<br />The Aspiring Actress <i>thinks</i> she is supposed to tell her ex that she loved him and made a mistake. But then she realises that actually she has to get RDJ and his girlfriend back together. Cos turns out that the reason that Robert Downey Junior is a Cold Hearted Businessman is that his best friends in all the world, the people he loved, left him when he was six and he never saw them again.<br /><br />And they all go to Heaven and RDJ lives happily ever after.<br /><br />As my use of capital letters may have showed you, this film is cliched as hell. But it&#39;s sweet and charming and cute. Oh and did I mention that at one point Robert Downey Junior sings and dances down the street?<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ka5qz/""><img alt="""" height=""308"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ka5qz"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;"" width=""469"" /></a><br /><br /><br />Also, it makes much of the relationships between these four disparate people, stuck together for the past 30 odd years, which gives the film more emotional depth.<br /><br />Also, Robert Downey Junior gets to show his acting ability when his character is possessed by the four ghosts. The different characterisations are subtle but distinct.<br /><br />And did I mention that he sings and dances down the street?<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""42""/><br /><br />So, Heart and Souls.

"event","So, anyone who has been following me on Twitter recently will know that my most recent fandom obsession is Horrible Histories.<br /><br />For those of you that don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about, well, keep reading and you will soon know.<br /><br />I refer, of course, to the current CBBC sketch show based on the series of books. Now, before you all turn your noses up at the thought of reading about a kids show, let me just tell you that it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s really not. For a start, it was always intended to be a family show, for all that it airs on CBBC. It was always meant to be the kind of show that the whole family could sit down and enjoy together. And thus, what we ended up with was a really intelligent sketch show that doesn&rsquo;t talk down to kids and is really funny.<br /><br />No, seriously, it is just properly funny. We&rsquo;re talking &quot;could give Blackadder a run for its money&quot; funny.<br /><lj-cut text=""Need convincing? Then read on...""><br />Let me start by showing what got me interested in the show. At some point in the last couple of years, I got linked to this video:<br /><lj-embed id=""31""/><br /><br />Just look what a great comic idea that is: the 4 King Georges as a boy band, singing about things that happened during their reigns. And how perfectly executed, with the lighting, the stools, the synchronised dance moves, the standing up on the key change!<br /><br />All of it is well thought out, well written and well executed. The songs are some of my favourite bits about the show, whether it&rsquo;s King Charles II as a rapper, Cleopatra as a Lady Ga-ga alike or Vikings a rock band.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""32""/><br /><br />But they aren&rsquo;t the only great bits of the show.<br /><br />There are some superbly executed spoofs of existing shows, such a Historical Master Chef, Ready Steady Feast, Historical Come Dine With Me or Historical Fashion Fix, complete with its very own Gok Wan:<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""33""/><br /><br /><br />Obviously, the kids watching will know these shows, but really only the parents will fully appreciate how well done these are (see what I mean about it not being just a kids show)<br /><br />I mean, just look at this next song; an Adam Ant parody about Highwaymen. How many kids have even heard of Adam Ant, let alone understand how spot on this is:<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""34""/><br /><br />But don&rsquo;t get the impression that everything about the show is a spoof or a parody (although I admit I haven&rsquo;t mentioned the &quot;I&rsquo;m a Shouty Man&quot; adverts). For example:<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""35""/><br /><br />And just watch this:<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""36""/><br /><br />Look at that: a sketch telling kids not to believe everything they&rsquo;re told.<br />In fact, large parts of the show, much likes the books, are about correcting common misconceptions.<br /><br />Exhibit A: Shakespeare and Richard III<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""37""/><br /><br />Yes, there is a high number of poo and fart gags, but history was grimy and dirty, and, lets face it, they can be funny. And at least they are usually making a historical point, rather than for shock value.<br /><br />And jokes about death. You can&rsquo;t get away from the fact that people died in horrible ways, but don&rsquo;t forget some of them were just damn stupid:<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""38""/><br /><br />Stupid Deaths is one of my favourite segments of the show. As is Bob Hale. With the Civil War report:<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""39""/><br /><br />We all love Bobsy! Especially when you realise that that pretty much has to be one take.<br /><br />But one of the best parts about this show is that it&rsquo;s not just funny, it is, for the most part, historically accurate as well. It manages to slip stealth learning into kids heads. And that is the very best kind of thing to do. Like in this sketch about the causes of the First World War:<br /><lj-embed id=""40""/><br /><br /><br />So, how do they manage it? How do they manage to be funny and intelligent and brilliant and all of those things? Simple. The people. The people involved a brilliant.<br /><br />For a start, Terry Deary (author of the amazing books that kicked all of this off) is involved in the writing of the show, and has even appeared in a number of episodes, so it clearly has his seal of approval.<br /><br />Secondly, they haven&rsquo;t got kids tv people in. They&rsquo;ve got comedy people in. The performers and writers all have careers in &ldquo;proper grown up comedy&rdquo; including Peep Show, Spy (a recent and excellent Sky One comedy which I may have cause to write more about later), Gavin and Stacy, The Armstrong and Miller Show, Rev, The Thick of It, The Impressions Show and The Office to name but a few. So these people aren&rsquo;t trying to make children&rsquo;s tv, they&rsquo;re trying to make funny tv. And that makes all the difference in the world.<br /><br /><br />I just can&rsquo;t explain how much I love this show. It just puts me in a good mood. Literally. A couple of weeks ago I had a really shitty journey home after visiting my dad, and by the time I got back to my dad&rsquo;s I was spitting tacks, ready to kill my neighbours because I happened to be able to hear them. One episode of Horrible Histories was all it took for me to relax and behave like a rational human being again.<br /><br />I&#39;m just gonna finish with one of the sketches I love:<br /><lj-embed id=""41""/><br /><br />Ok, so I&rsquo;ve spoken about the bits I love about the show, why I think it works and how happy it makes me. In the interest of balance, I think it&rsquo;s only fair to go on to the other things I like about the show; the pretty pretty men who make it.<br /><br />Yes, I&rsquo;m shallow, but I think that&rsquo;s been firmly established by now. It doesn&rsquo;t help that they are clearly good mates, are all on twitter and tweet adorably at each other. They make me just want to squeesh them in a great big hug.<br /><br />So first there must be special mention of Simon Farnaby because he is awesome and I love him, but he has scary hair and it scares me:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000eqa84/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000eqa84"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 171px; height: 171px;"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000erpr5/""><img alt="""" height=""260"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000erpr5"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;"" width=""195"" /></a><br /><br />And as previously established, I am shallow like a<br />shallow thing, so he will only be making a guest appearance in the coming picspam.<br /><br />Next we have Mat Baynton. He suffers from what I like to call &ldquo;The Reid Effect&rdquo; in that, much like Spencer Reid in Criminal Minds, the fandom, especially the teenage girl corner of the fandom, all love him and think he is the most wonderful thing because he is skinny and lanky and vaguely emo and a little bit woobie. I&hellip; well I can see the appeal of Mat more than Reid.<br />He is, after all, a Dandy Highwayman:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000esdkc/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000esdkc/s640x480"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 321px; height: 200px;"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000et020/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000et020/s640x480"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 316px; height: 197px;"" /></a><br /><br />He is the youngest cast member at only 26, and at times he looks even younger:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ewqz2/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ewqz2"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 295px; height: 234px;"" /></a><br /><br />Although, actually I don&rsquo;t know what that photo is from, so actually, he could just have been really young when it was taken.<br /><br />This, however, was from Horrible Histories so is about 2 years old. I like to call it &ldquo;The Artful Dodger, a few years later&rdquo;:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000exxp1/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000exxp1"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 211px; height: 158px;"" /></a><br /><br />As I said, he is a little bit emo, but I think this is overdoing the guyliner a bit<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000eyd51/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000eyd51"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 296px; height: 166px;"" /></a><br /><br />Perhaps hipster is a better description than emo:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ezk1f/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ezk1f/s640x480"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 268px; height: 359px;"" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f0kcw/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f0kcw/s640x480"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 488px; height: 311px;"" /></a><br />But however we describe him, we must remember that comedy is Srs Bsns!<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f1d4r/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f1d4r"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 298px; height: 224px;"" /></a><br /><br />Mat is, however, incapable of pulling a normal face in photos. It is entirely possible that he might just not *have* a normal face:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f2939/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f2939"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 364px; height: 218px;"" /></a><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f3913/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f3913/s640x480"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 231px; height: 348px;"" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f44fy/""><img alt="""" height=""348"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f44fy"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;"" width=""213"" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f50q0/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000f50q0/s640x480"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 259px; height: 347px;"" /></a><br /><br /><br />But that&rsquo;s ok, because on Horrible Histories he gets to wear a lot of uniforms.

Accidentally caught an episode the other week and I loved it. I think Mat Baynton is one of the best things about it because he plays the quirky best friend and gets to pop up at odd moments, say funny things and disappear.

It went quite well, everyone seemed pleased with what we came up with. I think something from our idea will be taken forward from here. I just hope we don&#39;t have to be too closely involved in it.

Very good. I can see why it won all the Oscars. It tells the story of the three bomb disposal guys and the last weeks of their tour of Iraq. It&#39;s a small, intimate movie, focussing just on these three guys and a few supporting characters. My favourite being the very British mercanaries who turn up for about 30 seconds before everyone starts getting shot. And by very British I mean, actually British, not Hollywood British.<br /><br />It is also homoerotic like woah. Well, duh, it&#39;s about the Army. They&#39;re all about the Male Bonding. I mean, obviously, my goggles are welded on, but still.<br /><br />My only issue with the film is the lighting. I mean obviously, I know that they&#39;re trying for a gritty and realistic feel, and they manage it. I just think that wouldn&#39;t have been lost had I been able to *see* what was on screen. Ok, so there&#39;s one scene where they&#39;re going through the streets at night without lights, and the bits where the screen is completely black and all you can hear is breathing, they are great for ramping up the tension. But the bit where they&#39;re on base and having a drink and arsing around, it would not have lost anything, had I been able to see more than their silouettes.<br /><br />But that aside, you really get a feel for the hell these men are going through and the tensions and moments of camaraderie between them all.&nbsp; A brilliant film."

"">James Barnes, Jim to his friends, had been Cabin Boy aboard <i>The Avenger</i> for nearly two months now, and in that time he had never seen Captain Rogers smile. The Dread Pirate Rogers was one of the most feared pirates in the seven seas, well known for his lightening raids on coastal towns with his brave and loyal pirate crew. Some said that he had made a deal with the devil in order to command his boat, others said he had cut out his heart for the love of a woman and whoever held it controlled the Captain, but the story that Jim was most inclined to believe was that he was an ex-Navy man, accused of a crime he hadn&rsquo;t committed, who had escaped and set out to find the man who set him up, and avenge the deaths of the men under his command who hadn&rsquo;t been so lucky.<br /><br />Jim paused in his chore of swabbing the deck to think about the time since he had joined the crew of <i>The Avenger</i>. He had run away to sea for excitement and adventure, but mostly it seemed to involve cleaning things and coiling ropes.<br />When he saw Clint, the best lookout on the ship, and the man who had taken him under his wing when he joined the crew, the only man who had really made him feel welcome, he complained about the dull days.<br />Clint had only grinned and slapped him on the back.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ah but just you wait till Cap gets sniff o&rsquo; the First Officer. Then we&rsquo;ll be in for some action,&rdquo; he said, with all the sagacity of a lad of nineteen who had been on the sea since he was twelve.<br /><br />&ldquo;The First Officer? What did he do?&rdquo; asked Jim, hoping for a story of betrayal and revenge like the ones his grandpa told him back home.<br /><br />&ldquo;Do? He went missing. Just disappeared one day when he was s&rsquo;posed to be fetchin&rsquo; supplies. No one saw him go, he vanished, like a genie. And Cap, he ain&rsquo;t cracked a smile since the moment he left.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Maybe he ran away?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Nah, he&rsquo;d never&rsquo;ave left the Cap&rsquo;n. They&rsquo;re closer&rsquo;n man and wife. I swear&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;What rubbish you feeding the boy, Barton?&rdquo;<br /><br />They were interrupted at that moment by Doc Blake, the ship&rsquo;s surgeon, a wiry man who walked with a limp ever since he had to sew up a cutlass wound in his own leg.<br /><br />&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; Doc. Just tellin&rsquo; Jimmy here about First Officer Stark and how he disappeared all spooky and peculiar.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk rot. He was kidnapped by one of the Captain&rsquo;s enemies, you mark my words. Don&rsquo;t you have a watch now? Git!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; said Barton, throwing an insult to salutes and grinning, before shinning up the rigging faster than you could say Jack Robinson.<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you listen to anything that young jackanapes says,&rdquo; growled the Doctor. &ldquo;If he had half the brains he was born with, he&rsquo;d be dangerous. Now, get along, the Captain wants to see you.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jim gulped nervously. Captain Rogers had barely said two words to him the whole time he&rsquo;d been aboard ship. He scurried off to the Captain&rsquo;s cabin.<br /><br />It was the first time he&rsquo;d been inside, and he was amazed at the size of it. There was a chart-covered desk that was bigger than the space where his hammock hung, and a bed that looked big enough to fit two people in.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ah, Jim, lad, there you are,&rdquo; said Captain Rogers, looking up from the piece of paper he was studying.<br /><br />Jim snapped to attention, hoping the Captain hadn&rsquo;t noticed him staring around the room.<br /><br />&ldquo;At ease, son, I&rsquo;m not going to eat you. How are you enjoying life at sea? Everything you were hoping it would be?&rdquo;<br /><br />Jim wondered what to say. Two months he&rsquo;d been aboard ship, and he still didn&rsquo;t feel quite like part of the crew. A grey<br />feeling hung over the ship, and Jim didn&rsquo;t know why. A feeling that something had stopped and everyone was held until it started again. Torn between honesty and the realisation that several days in the middle of the ocean was not the best<br />time to begin voicing dissenting opinions, Jim took the middle path.<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said, a little nervously, &ldquo;I thought there&rsquo;d be more&hellip; action. Less&hellip; waiting.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;&rdquo; said Captain Rogers, going back to studying the piece of paper in his hand.<br /><br />It was then that Jim noticed that spread across the desk were not sea charts as he had assumed, but maps of a land with strange names he did not recognise.<br /><br />&ldquo;Can you ride?&rdquo; the Captain asked, suddenly.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ride?&rdquo; asked Jim, taken aback. &ldquo;A horse?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes, a horse, boy, what did you think I meant? Can you ride?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Since I was five.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Good. Good.&rdquo; Captain Rogers started making notes on the map in front of him. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t worry, lad, soon you&rsquo;ll get all the action you ever dreamed of.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jim stood there for a minute or two longer, but when the Captain only continued to make notes, he quietly slipped out of the cabin, wondering what on earth the man was planning.<br /><br />He was startled out of his thoughts by the harsh shriek of Redwing, the parrot. He looked up; if Redwing was about, then Sam, the ship&rsquo;s armourer, couldn&rsquo;t be far behind.<br /><br />&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; Jim said, running up to the man, &ldquo;do you know what Cap&rsquo;s planning?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Aye, I think I have an inkling,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But when he&rsquo;s good n ready, the Cap&rsquo;n will lay it out for us. Keep ready. Something&rsquo;s in the wind.&rdquo;<br /><br />***<br /><br />Three days later, Clint shouted down from his perch in the crow&rsquo;s nest &ldquo;Land Ho! Thirty miles off the starboard bow. Should make dock by nightfall.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Good spot, Hawkeye,&rdquo; shouted the Captain, who had been strolling the deck, conversing intently with Sam. &ldquo;I knew I kept you on this ship for a reason.&rdquo;<br /><br />He had the closest thing to a smile Jim had seen him with since he joined the crew, although a grimace of determination might be a better description.<br /><br />&ldquo;Crew! Assemble! We have work to do before we rest tonight.&rdquo;<br /><br />Captain Rogers gathered his men and told them of his plan.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Dawn the next morning saw the crew of <i>The Avenger</i> mounted on the oddest assortment of equines ever seen. Captain Rogers had bought or hired near every beast that could charitably be called horse in the town where they had docked. Jim couldn&rsquo;t quite believe what the Captain had planned. For a start they had left The Avenger in dock, and for seconds they were about to head inland in search of a castle that some said was mere legend. It was action and adventure alright, but not quite the kind he had envisaged all those months ago. But it was better than coiling rope.<br /><br />They had left the ship under the care of Captain Fury, a salty old seadog with an eye patch and a wooden leg, and Jim very much doubted it would be there when they got back. However, there were whispers among the crew that Fury owed Captain Rogers a favour from way back in the war, and the Captain trusted him, so all Jim could do was hope for the best.<br /><br />Captain Rogers rode to the front of the crew on his white charger, and addressed the assembled men.<br /><br />&ldquo;Gentlemen. We have ahead of us a difficult journey. The going may be tough. It will be dangerous. Any man who wishes to leave now may do so with no fear.&rdquo; He paused. No one moved. &ldquo;Thank you. Your loyalty this day will be remembered. Come. Let us depart. We have far to travel before sundown.&rdquo;<br /><br />He turned and spurred his horse along the road, the morning sun glinting off of his blond hair. Jim urged his piebald pony forward with the other men, prepared to meet any danger.<br /><br />***<br /><br />It was a hard journey, a two week trek into country that only became more barren and inhospitable with every mile they travelled. On the morning of the fifteenth day, Clint came back from scouting ahead with a grin plastered all over his face.<br /><br />&ldquo;Cap, I see it! Round the next bend, in the distance, a huge castle with five towers and high walls. We&rsquo;ve found it. We&rsquo;ve found Baron Von Doom&rsquo;s castle!&rdquo;<br /><br />Captain Rogers spurred his horse onwards, the motley crew of ex-pirates following behind.<br /><br />They rounded the corner and stopped at the sight that greeted them. A castle, dark and forbidding, with dark clouds swirling around the tops of the high towers. This was what they had come all this way to find.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Captain Rogers went over the plan one more time. &ldquo;At first light tomorrow, we attack. The morning light weakens Doom, he is at his most vulnerable. Sam, you&rsquo;re with me. Everyone else, you distract the guards long enough for us to get into the castle, and keep them busy until we emerge. Then, head back for this clearing, find your horse and go. We meet up at the town ten miles west of the border and get to the ship as soon as may be.&nbsp; Doom is powerful, yes, but he has no power beyond the borders of his country. If we can reach it before he catches up with us, we&rsquo;ll be safe.&rdquo;<br /><br />***<br /><br />Jim crept up to the castle walls with the other pirates. They tensed, waiting, then at the Captain&rsquo;s signal, they threw grapples over the wall and swarmed up them. Nothing had prepared Jim for what awaited on the other side of the wall. Fifty, one hundred knights in armour, armed with swords, maces and halberds. They turned, as one, to look at the intruders, and began to walk towards them, the only sound the clanking of metal upon metal. Captain Rogers drew his cutlass and swung it at the neck of the nearest knight. It&rsquo;s head was severed in one blow, and it fell over,&nbsp; cogs and gears spilling all over the floor.<br /><br />&ldquo;See!&rdquo; he yelled, triumphantly, &ldquo;they are merely clockwork! Easily defeated!&rdquo;<br /><br />With a roar, the crew leapt to, drawing weapons and fighting the metal men with the fierceness that had won them a reputation on three separate continents.<br /><br />In the madness, Captain Rogers and Sam slipped away to the entrance of the tall central tower.<br /><br />For all that the knights were machines, they fought like dervishes, without tiring and without end. But they were no match for the crew of <i>The Avenger</i>, who took them down with military precision. But the machines kept coming. As fast as they destroyed them, new ones took their place, wave upon wave of them.<br /><br />Just as Jim thought he could swing his sword no more, Sam&rsquo;s voice cut through the sound of battle.<br /><br />&ldquo;Retreat, retreat, quickly, back over the wall!&rdquo;<br /><br />Jim looked up in time to see Sam emerge from the tower, followed by a man he almost didn&rsquo;t recognise as the Captian, so much did the ear splitting grin covering his face transform it. Behind him, holding his hand, was a woman, in a flowing pink gown, a large pink conical hat on her head, a pink veil covering her face. They had come all this way, just to rescue a princess? And, Jim decided as they got closer, she was the ugliest princess he had ever seen. He had only caught a glimpse as her veil whipped about as she ran, but she looked like she had a worse beard than his grandma!<br /><br />&ldquo;Run lad!&rdquo; shouted Doc Blake, pushing him towards the wall and running incredibly sure for a man with a limp. It was<br />almost as if battle had magically transformed him. &nbsp;<br /><br />Jim had little time to think then as he climbed back over the wall and ran for the clearing. As he reached the ground there came a great shout of anger from the depths of the castle, and lightning flashed from the clouds perpetually surrounding the towers. It spurred the men back to their camp even faster than before<br /><br />Jim jumped onto his pony and set off, looking over his shoulder in time to see the Princess swing herself into the saddle behind the Captain, her hat having been lost in the pell mell dash for the horses. It was then that Jim realised with a shock that she was no princess, that she was, in fact, a man, slight in build, with a neatly trimmed beard and a scholarly face.<br /><br />&ldquo;Come on, lad,&rdquo; Captain Rogers shouted, speeding past, &ldquo;move yourself!&rdquo;<br /><br />Even now, with magical storms brewing behind them and the ever present danger of more mechanical soldiers, the smile that Jim had observed earlier was still threatening to split his face in two.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Not until they had crossed the borders of Latveria did they slow down and pause to catch a breath. Jim had managed to keep pace with Captain Rogers, all the time wondering who on earth the man who rode with him was.<br />It wasn&rsquo;t until they made camp on fringe of the town where they had agreed to meet, that it occurred to Jim that there was no way that his little pony could have kept up with the Captain&rsquo;s charger, even carrying the weight of two, and so the man must have slowed down to allow him to keep up. Jim began to see why the crew of <i>The Avenger</i> followed their Captain so loyally.<br /><br />Captain Rogers greeted each man as he arrived, relaxing a little more every time someone returned safely. The camp was soon set up, and Logan, the ship&rsquo;s cook, began to make dinner. The man in the dress had disappeared into the Captain&rsquo;s tent, and arrived just as the food was ready, this time dressed in a dark red shirt, with black trousers and boots, a cutlass by his side and a feathered hat perched upon his head.<br /><br />The crew seated around the fire cheered as he emerged and sat down next to Captain Rogers.<br /><br />Clint raised his mug of ale. &ldquo;To First Officer Stark, the prettiest princess I ever did see!&rdquo;<br /><br />The pirates whooped and cheered, and even the Captain laughed, slinging an arm around the First Officer&rsquo;s shoulders and raising his glass.<br /><br />Jim watched the crew laugh and joke, celebrating the return of one of their own. So this was the famous first officer, whose loss had supposedly depressed the Captain&rsquo;s spirits so. Jim wondered how on earth he had ended up in that castle, dressed in that ridiculous dress. As if reading his mind, Sam leant forward, Redwing perched on his shoulder, and asked,<br /><br />&ldquo;So, Tony, why did Baron Von Doom kidnap you and lock you in his tower?&rdquo;<br /><br />First Officer Stark shrugged, &ldquo;Apparently, he needed a princess born when the planets aligned in order to complete some arcane ritual to summon demons or some such. Unfortunately for him, no princesses were born at the right time, and even more unfortunately for me, I was, and the Baron got hold of the idea that if he treated me like a princess I would suffice. Hence the stupid dress and locking me in the highest room of the tallest tower with only a spinning wheel and a magic mirror that thought it was a wit for company. I have never been so glad to see your ugly mug!&rdquo;<br /><br />The crew laughed, Jim joining in, realising for the first time how the Captian&rsquo;s mood had affected all of the crew.<br />He looked at the Captain, who seemed a full ten years younger, and at that moment decided that he would follow where he lead for the rest of his life.<br /><br />He crept closer to the fire, a feeling of belonging settling into his bones for the first time in a long time.<br /><br />&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s this lad?&rdquo; asked the first officer, noticing his movement. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall seeing his face before today.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;James. James Barnes,&rdquo; said Jim, suddenly nervous as every crew member turned to look at him. &ldquo;Everyone calls me Jim. I&rsquo;ve been Cabin Boy aboard <i>The Avenger</i> for these two months past.&rdquo;<br /><br />A shadow passed behind Stark&rsquo;s eyes at the reminder of how long he had been captive.<br /><br />&ldquo;You rode well earlier, boy.

"event","What have I been up to? Not all that much, as it happens. Since coming back from Cardiff I have spent all of my weeks at work and all of my weekends visiting one parent or another.<br /><br />My best friend from when I was small got married, which was just kinda scary cos she&#39;s only 4 days older than me and now she has a <i>husband</i>. But it was also lovely and sweet and they&#39;re clearly in love and it was just nice.<br /><br />I watched my brother in a couple of shows, one of which was Return to the Forbidden Planet, which reminded me just why it is one of my top 3 favourite musicals (I don&#39;t have a favourite. I have a top 3 of Return to the Forbidden Planet, Les Miserables and La Cage Aux Folles, which are all so absoultely different that I could never compare them to pick an absolute top).<br /><br />And I had a lovely day out in Brighton with <lj user=""requiem2adream"" /> where we wandered around town, got cookies and had long and intense conversations about comic books. Perfect day really.<br /><br />Oh and I continued working on my group project which I posted about a while back. I have to work with some complete morons, but I&#39;ve ranted enough about them IRL to want to do it here. Also the project is nearly over; on Thursday we are presenting our findings to a group of people that includes the CEO of the companly (*ulp*).<br /><br />Also coming up, I am going to see Doctor Faustus at the Globe, starring Arthur Darvill as Mephistopheles. JOY. It is a very slightly belated birthday present to Hayley, which I <i>in no way</i> picked because I really wanted to see it too. Nu-uh.<br /><br />And that&#39;s pretty much it. My driving lessons continue, and we&#39;re ramping up to show time with the chorus show.<br /><br />So, on to the review.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209109/"">Fourplay (2001)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e84t9/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e84t9"" style=""width: 100px; height: 149px;"" /></a><br />On my list because Colin Firth. And what an odd little film this is. For starters, Colin Firth has ridiculous <i>ridculous</i> facial hair.<br /><a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wkmXx6hk8y0/TmNp8IP7t_I/AAAAAAAAABQ/OSjEBd-JUmU/s1600/Colin+Firth%27s+ridiculous+facial+hair.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wkmXx6hk8y0/TmNp8IP7t_I/AAAAAAAAABQ/OSjEBd-JUmU/s1600/Colin+Firth%2527s+ridiculous+facial+hair.jpg"" style=""width: 321px; height: 241px;"" /></a><br /><br />See?<br /><br />So, the plot? Colin Firth is, I think, some kind of television producer or something, and he is married to an American who is the star of some really crap and unfunny looking sitcom. They are friends with an American who is one of the principal writers on the awful sitcom and is married to the French make up girl.<br /><br />Jack Dee also plays a writer and he just kind of confuses me because my hindbrain keeps throwing up the adjective &quot;hot&quot; to describe him whilst the rest of me goes &quot;but it&#39;s Jack Dee&quot; and it all just does not compute.<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--xT0YicMR-Y/TmNp-ic-KbI/AAAAAAAAABU/5WdLrMJY0KY/s1600/Jack+Dee+does+odd+things+to+my+brain.jpg"" style=""width: 139px; height: 206px;"" /><br /><br />This all takes place in Hollywood London, where the only parts of London that exist are inside the Circle Line, and even then, only the nice&nbsp; bits. Also, whilst this film claims to have been made in 2001, the tragic curtains (the hairstyle, I mean), the power suits and the quality of the film stock, all proclaim this to have been made in the mid-90s.<br /><br />Colin Firth&#39;s character frequents the most stereotypical pub you can imagine, where beer is still served in pint mugs with handles. Apparently he used to get drunk and beat people up, but I just can&#39;t imagine it. Not even later in the film when he <i>does</i> get drunk and beat people up.<br /><br />So, The Writer and The Star (you think I really cared enough to remember names?) share a possibly drunken kiss at some point and this stirs a mutual longing in them. They notice the The Producer and The Make-Up Artist share much more in common than they have with their actual spouses and also seem to have an attraction thing going on between them.<br /><br />The Writer and The Star then decide that it&#39;s not really cheating if the other too have sex with each other *first* so they spring a trap by planning a dual-couple retreat to a country B&amp;B and then crying off at the last minute, leaving the other two to go to the romantic getaway<br />alone. Except they&#39;re not alone because the two Americans have secretly set up shop in the room next door where they can hear if the others have sex through the incredibly thin walls. (This plan having been inspired by Jack Dee complaining about staying in the same place and hearing the couple next door all weekend). Then some &quot;wacky hijinks&quot; ensue with them having to swap rooms in order to be able to&nbsp; hear what occurs.<br /><br />It transpires, however, that hearing your spouse cheating on you isn&#39;t actually much of a turn on, and so The Americans are disappointed. Their day gets even worse, however when it turns out that The Producer and The Make Up-Artist have decided that they are in love and they want divorces and then subsequently marry each other. The Writer and The Star get together, largely, it seems, in order to have something to do.<br /><br />The Producer and The Make-Up Artist have some relationship difficulties and she wants to have counselling, but he, being all English and<br />reserved and shit doesn&#39;t want to, and only consents to go if they go to some chap he knows who isn&#39;t actually a relationship councillor, but<br />specialises in work-place relationships. This is none other than Stephen Fry who swiftly becomes the best thing about the movie and&nbsp; has<br />spectacularly floofy hair, of which, unfortunately, I cannot find a picture.<br /><br />The best part of the whole film is Colin Firth and Stephen Fry being incredibly English at each other whilst desperately trying <i>not</i> to discuss Colin Firth&#39;s sex life.<br /><br />Then some other shit happens that I really don&#39;t care about where it turns out that The Producer and The Make-Up Artist&#39;s relationship is<br />much stronger than The Writer and The Star&#39;s so the former stay together while the latter fall apart.<br /><br />So I guess the moral of the story is don&#39;t encourage your partner to cheat on you so that you can have sex with someone else?<br /><br />Yeah...<br /><br />Also, I discover this movie also goes under the title of Londinium, which I can&#39;t decide if it is better or worse than Fourplay. It&#39;s not <i>entirely</i><br />as pretentious as is sounds because The Make-Up artist writes a book called Londinium in the film (a fact I found too boring to remember<br />until now)<br /><br />This film was just... odd. And pointless."

<![endif]-->  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Goodness. What a busy week I&rsquo;ve had. Any yet, actually I haven&rsquo;t been that busy. I just spent the past week in Cardiff, catching up with everyone and basically pretending I was a student again.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was glorious. Going back to work on Monday is gonna <i style="""">suuuuuuck</i>.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longness and rambling""><p class=""MsoNormal"">Didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;do&rdquo; much this week, but that was fine by me. Spent one day in town going to New York Deli, Troutmark and Forbidden Planet. You know, the important stuff. Bought a couple of books and Civil War: Iron Man purely because it contains The Confession and as much as I know that reading it is going to rip my heart to shreds, I have to do it.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">But other than a brief sojourn into the city centre I did very little except hang with everybody, read fic, pootle about on the internet and watch films. A lot of films.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I guess that is what happens when you base your entire holiday around watching Captain America and having a Marvel Movie Weekend. Which is what I did. This was something we&rsquo;d been planning for over a year. Since before I went to Comic Con last year.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So what did we do? Simple. We decided to watch every single Marvel Movie we could before and after watching the Captain America Movie. Except Daredevil and Elektra. No one needs to be subjected to those. We started with Fantastic Four on the Friday night, which is a fun and entertaining movie that I will always have a soft spot for. Then we followed it with Spiderman which makes me want to punch Tobey Maguire in the face. It&rsquo;s so frustrating that I find him so irritating because I love Peter Parker. He&rsquo;s&hellip; well pretty high up on the list of my favourite heroes, even if I&rsquo;m not sure quite where.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>And Tobey Maguire isn&rsquo;t totally without acting ability, even if you couldn&rsquo;t tell from watching this movie. Another reason he annoyed me is that he look like Jake Gyllenhaal, only devoid of his charm and attractiveness. Really looking forward to the reboot.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">On Saturday morning we watched X-men Origins: Wolverine because&hellip; uh, I think we might be masochists?</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">And then because we apparently hadn&rsquo;t inflicted enough pain on ourselves, we watched Spiderman 2.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">We decided to alternate to spread out the crap a little, so next watched X-men. And then that evening we went to the cinema to see Captian America. Oh boy. I love that film beyond imagining. The last film to wring such physical joy from me on seeing it<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>was Star Trek. And I saw that 5 times at the cinema. I just&hellip; just&hellip; everything about Steve Rogers that caused me to fall harder and faster for a fictional character than I ever have before, was perfectly distilled into that film. I don&rsquo;t have the words. It was just wonderful.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">We decided after that that we should watch the continuity movies in chronological order. This decision had nothing to do with the fact that none of us could quite bring ourselves to put ourselves through X-2, X-3 and Spiderman 3. Nothing at all.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So when we got back we watched uh&hellip; an <i style="""">extra legal</i> copy of X-Men: First Class. (Ok so it&rsquo;s <i style="""">technically </i>not a continuity movie, but still. It rules. So it counts).</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Then Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk (the <i style="""">good </i>one), and another extra legal copy of Thor.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">From the Marvel Movie Marathon we discovered two things: if Marvel Science glows blue, that means it&rsquo;s working, and we never want to be the parents or surrogate parent figures of a Marvel movie character. These are not jobs with long life expectancies.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Other films we watched were Inception, Chances Are and Tangled. And proper love film reviews of those last two follow, along with The Men Who Stare at Goats.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Oh and we saw Captain America the second time. And it was still awesome.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I had been looking forward to this week for so long and I&rsquo;m so glad it was so awesome. I just hadn&rsquo;t realised how much I needed it. For a start I just needed a break. From work partly, but also from life in general. Now, I won&rsquo;t deny that I am an exceedingly lucky shit, and I ought to be more grateful than I am about how my life in general is at the moment, and don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am. But, well, I haven&rsquo;t had any time off since I started my job (christ, 11 months ago tomorrow it will be) that hasn&rsquo;t involved me bouncing up and down the country, rushing around to meet up with people, and generally not having the time to just <i style="""">do nothing</i>. Hell, I&rsquo;ve barely had a weekend that hasn&rsquo;t involved much of the same. So it was nice to have everyone I wanted to see in one place, to have no hard and fast plans, to not have to be somewhere or do something, to not have to try and cram everything into a few all to short days. Just be able to recharge my batteries.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">But more than that, I needed to just hang with my friends. This is the only place I can really explain it, because I know my family wouldn&rsquo;t understand, and neither can my colleagues, but I <i style="""">needed</i> to sit around and mock films and generally dork about with my friends. It&rsquo;s one of the things I miss the most, the communal watching experience, the silly jokes, but more than that, the ability to be <i style="""">me</i>, free and unfettered.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">It sounds stupid and pretentious but it&rsquo;s true. I work with a bunch of geeks and I like them all very much, and they understand me more than most, but I still can&rsquo;t be everything I am around them. I can quote obscure TV shows and books and let my enthusiasm for insignificant things show through, but I can&rsquo;t squee over how wonderfully slashy the last whatever I just watched was, I can&rsquo;t bounce about the fic I just read, and I can&rsquo;t go all mushy over Chris Evans in dress uniform. In short, I can be a fan, but I can&rsquo;t be a fangirl. And I wouldn&rsquo;t really want to. My colleagues don&rsquo;t need to know that much about my private life. (Case in point, this week, my friends were able to guess 3 out of the definite 4 people on my Exceptions List without trying, and got the fourth eventually. The guys at work don&rsquo;t need to know that. Really.)</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">And my family, well&hellip; my family have long since accepted that they will never understand some of the things that excite and enthuse me, and they are willing to put up with me rambling about the latest thing I&rsquo;m obsessing over as long as I am willing to put up with blank stares when I&rsquo;m done.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So, really, my friends are the only people who know everything about me, and don&rsquo;t just accept me, but understand and positively <i style="""">encourage</i> it. And normally, I&rsquo;m popping in for a whistlestop visit, there&rsquo;s a party or a something to do, and while we have a great time and a great catch up, I am always aware that time is short, and so we shouldn&rsquo;t just all be sitting in the front room on our laptops, not really saying much but sharing the companionship of mutual geekness.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So. That basically sums up why I love my friends so much and why this week was amazing and wonderful and just what I needed. I didn&rsquo;t quite expect it to turn into such and essay, but then, I never do. (Also I am amused at how I keep referring to <i style="""">my friends</i> as if I don&rsquo;t know that you guys are pretty much the only people who ever read this)</p></lj-cut><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;m going to go and cook some dinner, and when I&rsquo;m done, I&rsquo;ll write the movie reviews that I sat down to write in the first place.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">First up</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""The Men Who Stare At Goats (2010)""><p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1234548/"">The Men Who Stare At Goats (2009)</a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e3kqy/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e3kqy"" style=""width: 306px; height: 204px;"" alt="""" /></a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">This was on my list because the trailer looked ridiculous and I never got round to seeing it. And it was that. It is the goofiest film I have seen in quite some time. In the 60s the army set up a secret division called (if I remember correctly) The New Warriors with the aim of exploring non-violent and non-technological warfare. The unit is run by an ex-soldier-turned-hippie and using a variety of different New Age techniques and doctrines, starts developing psychic powers.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Flash forward to now and the Iraq War and a reporter (Ewan McGregor) seeks to prove himself to his ex-wife by becoming a war correspondent. Whilst waiting for entry to the country he meets George Clooney&rsquo;s character who claims to be psychic. Ewan McGregor accompanies George Clooney into the desert in an attempt to uncover the truth and to help George Clooney on his secret mission. Hijinks ensue. Including spiking a military base&rsquo;s water supply with LSD. And George Clooney has a ridik moustache.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">As I said, incredibly goofy. But thoroughly entertaining. And just the tone of film I happened to be looking for at the time.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">But what really made me like this film was that even if the plot hadn&rsquo;t been so goofy, it would still have been genuinely funny. A lot of the humour didn&rsquo;t come so much from the situation as the characters, especially Ewan and George bickering in their trek through the desert.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Half of the humour does come from the fact that the New Warriors or whatevs like to call themselves &ldquo;Jedi&rdquo; which leads to some classic exchanges like:</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Ewan McGregor: What&rsquo;s a Jedi?</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">George Clooney: I am.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">and George Clooney telling Ewan McGregor that he has an &ldquo;inner Jedi&rdquo;. There are other, more subtle Star Wars references that tickled me as well.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">The flashbacks to George Clooney&rsquo;s training were good even if he does sport the most hair you ever did see. There is a scene of awkward!Dancing that may well be my favourite.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e4ba3/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e4ba3"" style=""width: 205px; height: 131px;"" alt="""" /></a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Also, there is just something inherently funny about the sight of George Clooney giving Ewan McGregor a piggy back.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">All in all, a very silly and fun film. Some people might feel that the humour is a little dark, considering that it is set during a war that is very much current, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. George Clooney and Ewan McGregor have really good chemistry on screen, and their bickering is one of the highlights of the film. Plus, Ewan McGregor does that cute shy happy half smile of his that just sort of turns me to mush.</p></lj-cut><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Secondly,</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Chances Are (1989)""><p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097044/"">Chances Are (1989)</a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e5gdb/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e5gdb/s640x480"" style=""width: 155px; height: 237px;"" alt="""" /></a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">On my list because Robert Downey Junior. It looked like the kind of ridiculous crappy rom com he made in the 80s and 90s and that it would be silly and entertaining.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">It turns out that it tries to be that, but manages to be *really creepy*.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So, a woman (Cybill Shepherd) has been happily married for a year and has just found out she&rsquo;s pregnant. Her husband is played (at the moment &ndash; we&rsquo;ll get to that later) by the guy who played the bad guy in Flubber (and because of that I just can&rsquo;t see the character as being anything other than a douchebag because he is a douchebag in, like, <i style="""">everything</i>) His best friend is in love with her, and decided to tell</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">DouchebagFromFlubber on the day of their wedding, but that seems to be fine by him because they let him have a key to their house. He might live with them. It is unclear.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Possibly they just have some threesome thing going on. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. The best friend does not look like he would object as he appears to be in love with both of them.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Anyway, it&rsquo;s their anniversary and outside the restaurant DouchebagFromFlubber is run over and killed. The reaction to this scene probably should not have been group cackling and rewinding to see it again, but Cybill Shepherds reaction to seeing her husband knocked down in the street was just ridiculous.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Once in heaven he insists to be sent back to earth and since he kicks up such a fuss, the angels send him straight back instead of having to wait in the line for reincarnation.

"event","It's only been a couple of days since my last post, so not much to catch y'all up on. Pretty much the only thing of note that happened to me since then is I had a driving lesson earlier. And I sucked arse. Seriously bad. I dunno if I was to tired, if doing repetitive stuff at work all day just switched my brain off, or I was just having an off day, but I just kept making the same mistakes over and over. Was close to tears of frustration a couple of times. Alternatively, I could just be shit at driving.<br /><br />So, on to the review!<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Free Jimmy (2006)""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298337/"">Free Jimmy (2006)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e2br2/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e2br2/s640x480"" style=""width: 194px; height: 278px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />I have wanted to see this movie for several years now. It is originally a Norwgian film but they made an English, well dub isn't *quite* the right word, I think, as I'll explain. It first came onto my radar when it was announced that David Tennant would be voicing one of the characters in the English version. My interest was piqued, and I dug a bit deeper and discovered that Simon Pegg was writing the screenplay, as well as voicing a character. And this is why I don't really see it as a dub. To me, (and please correct me if I'm wrong) a dub is more of a straightforward translation, like subs but with voices, but to have someone else completely rewrite the screenplay strikes me as going just that step further. Also, from what I can tell, they've actually re-animated the characters' mouths to fit the words. <br />Anyway, with Simon Pegg on board I was certainly intrigued, and even more so to discover that the cast list contained Woody Harrelson, Jim Broadbent, Emilia Fox (ok, maybe not so much at the time as I&nbsp;wasn't watching Silent Witness back then), Kris Marshall, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Mark Gatiss.<br />The release date just kept getting pushed further and further back, until eventually it was released Direct to DVD in 2008 with very little fanfare, or indeed, distribution. And I just never got round to watching it. Until now...<br />...And unfortunately, I think I can say this is the first Love Film film that I&nbsp;just haven't enjoyed. I mean, Wolf was bad, but at least it was straying into &quot;so bad it's good&quot; territory.<br />I'm not sure I can can quite put my dissatisfaction with this movie into words. It starts with the art, I think. I just didn't like it. They seem to have gone for the &quot;claymation look in cg&quot; thing, but with none of the charm of either. I know this is supposed to be a dirty, grubby movie, and the art is supposed to reflect that, but I just didn't like it. The models for people are fairly stylised, but I wouldn't necessarily say outlandishly so, but the movement is really jerky and unrealistic. And it occasionally goes for really cartoonish violence that just seems out of place. I just didn't really enjoy any aspect of the art. Maybe if I had I would have been sucked into the story more. <br />And the story? Well, I knew the basics of the story going in, so it's not like I was shocked by the &quot;adult themes&quot; of the plot (and the 15 rating kind of gives it away). Although I could have lived without the sex scene. I just found it kind of boring. Basically, 3 stoners, called Gaz, Odd and Flea, are enticed by a mate, Roy Arnie to take a job at a dilapidated Russian circus, where one of the star attractions is Jimmy, and dilapidated elephant, who is a junkie because they keep him wasted on downers between shows to control him, and then perk him right up with speed when it's show time. It transpires that the reason Roy Arnie was so keen to get his mates to help out was that he hid about &pound;1million worth of heroin in Jimmy's arse (not, incidentally in the usual drug trafficking way, but by cutting him open and sewing him back up). He is also being followed by the Lappish Mafia for some other drug related dodad. I think he stole the arse-heroin off them. They are 3 dudes on motorbikes in ridiculous clothing. I imagine that if you are from Norway, this is some hilarious joke about something, but it just kinda comes of as weird in the English version. Meanwhile, a group of incompetent Animal Rights Activists hear about the circus and decide to, well, Free Jimmy. <br />And a group of inexplicably Scottish moose hunters are hanging around as well.&nbsp;<br />Blah, blah, blah, stuff happens, Jimmy gets lost on a Norwegian (oh yeah, the majority of the movie still takes place in Norway) moor, nearly dies from withdrawal, is rescued by a golden horned moose, and eventually all groups; stoners, mafia, activists, hunters and elephant end up in the same place, a mafia dude gets his head comically exploded by one of the hunters shooting him by accident. Which didn't make much sense to me, because, sure, you'd need something powerful to take down a moose, but they way the guy's head actually *explodes* was more like a shotgun, and I wouldn't have thought that's what you'd use. I'd have figured a high powered rifle or something, and I would have expected that to make a mess of the back of his head, but not so much the front. But what do I know?<br />Then Jimmy accidentally squishes flat the dog of one of the activists and she gets angry and shoots him, coincidentally right in the heroin, killing him instantly. The moose makes an avalanche to cover Jimmy... for some reason, I'd kind of stopped paying attention by this point. The movie ends with Roy Arnie, unaware that Jimmy is dead, heading out into a blizzard to look for him.<br />As I type the plot out, it reminds me a <em>lot</em> of Snatch or Lock, Stock. And I think that's it, I think that's why I don't like it. It's one of them done badly. The plot has too many twists and turns and doesn't really interleave the separate groups' stories very well. And it's not that the characters are unlikable, because I wouldn' t necessarily call the characters in Snatch or Lock, Stock *likable* it's just that they're lacking any charm to make you interested in them.<br />I guess that's the whole thing. The movie just lacks any kind of charm to draw you in. With the talent involved in this movie, I expected better. A disappointment.<br /></lj-cut>"

A mixture of Real Life and a continuing obsession with Channel Awesome got in the way.&nbsp; So what have I&nbsp;been up to?<br /><br />Well, I had a 3 day course on &quot;Introduction to Cryptography&quot; which was cool, I feel like I&nbsp;understand some of the more technical stuff rather more now.

I think Love Film did a &quot;Top Ten Liam Neeson Films&quot; article, and this was one of them, and it looked interesting.<br />And it certainly was. Well, it was a biopic of Alfred Kinsey, touching on his early life, but mostly concentrating on the time he was collecting data and writing his famous sex studies. It was lovely and character driven and wonderfully acted by a brilliant cast. And the cast, oh my, the cast. Liam Neeson, for a start. Laura Linnie plays his wife. She was Sarah, the American one in Love Actually. John Lithgow is his dad. Tim Curry is an academic rival. Chris O'Donnell (G. Callan in NCIS&nbsp;Los Angeles. With *hair*) is a researcher. As is Peter Sarsgaard. Who, coincidentally I saw today, looking almost unrecognisable in Green Lantern.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e0qth/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e0qth/s640x480"" style=""width: 382px; height: 172px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />Above: Peter Sarsgaard is second from the left, and Chris O'Donnell (with *hair*) is on the far right.<br />Below: Peter Sarsgaard in Green Lantern.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e1sbc/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000e1sbc"" style=""width: 219px; height: 146px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><br />And Oliver Platt is in charge of the university. Who, coincidentally, I saw today in X-men: First Class, looking the same as he always does.<br /><br />So, yes, this film is lovely.&nbsp; And contains quite a lot of sex. Duh.

"event","This has been rather a good week. It started off a bit sucky as work was a bit frustrating. It's quite annoying to not be able to do the thing you need to do because of the limitations of the language you are working in. The Guy continues to be a crap manager and I had a conversation with him that went like this:<br /><br />Me: I've put error handling in this C# code that will deal with any errors, but the underlying C that it relies on will only ever return success or will crash, not return a meaningful error.<br /><br />He: Well, don't rely on it staying like that, make sure you put error handling in.<br /><br /><em>(repeat ad nauseam)</em><br /><br />I&nbsp;was only telling him because fixing the C <em>so</em> isn't my department and I&nbsp;thought it might be something he should be aware of. But no, instead we have 5 minutes of him <em>comepletely missing my point and failing to listen to what I</em><em>'m actually saying</em>.<br /><br />But I&nbsp;can't complain too hard as I only worked for 3 days last week, as I had Thursday and Friday off. Because Thursday I was going to Thorpe Park with some friends from home for one of their birthdays. And because my life can never be <em>simple&nbsp;</em>this meant going back to Crawley. Because Thorpe Park is a pain in the arse to get to via public transport anyway, and even more so from north of London. So it was easier (for some value of easier) to take two days off work, go down to Crawley on Wednesday after work, stay with in Crawley Wednesday night, get driven up to Thorpe Park the next morning, go back to Crawley in the evening and then go back to Cambridge on Friday.<br /><br />So yeah, that's what I did. Thorpe Park was ace. The Saw Ride and Vortex weren't running which sucked because I was looking forward to going on both of them, and we got rained on a few times, but it was a good laugh and the queues weren't too big. And I <em>swear</em> they've sped up Colossus. <br /><br />Friday morning I&nbsp;went to see The Hangover: Part Two, which was entertaining enough, but would have been better if it wasn't basically <em>identical</em> to the first one. Note. For. Note. <br /><br />http://cracked.tumblr.com/post/5043893399/trailers-for-the-hangover-1-2-side-by-side<br /><br />Read that. It highlights how similar the two trailers are. Now imagine the *entire film* is like that. So, yeah. <br /><br />On Thursday I got a text from an old school friend asking me if I&nbsp;wanted to go to The London Expo on Saturday and I said &quot;hell yeah&quot;. It amuses me that they're trying to position themselves as &quot;London's Comic Con&quot;. I suppose it does feel <em>more</em> like Comic Con than any of the others, with stuff going on outside the centre and more exhibitions from companies showing off their new stuff, but it is still <em>very</em> heavily anime biased and until they give it a much broader appeal, it's just not going to cut it. And the stands were mostly for video games, so, eh. (BTW, Batman: Arkham City looks <em>amazeballs</em>) <br /><br />However, it being a less popular con meant I didn't have to queue up <em>forever</em> to get into the Futurama panel, which was just great. Those guys understand their audience and realise that, yeah we're interested in your answers to your questions, but we also want you to <em>do the funny voices</em>. So that was cool. <br /><br />And I bought some more shinies. I got Essential Captain America Vol. 2 for &pound;6 (Amazon price &pound;9ish), and vol 5 and 6 of Scott Pilgrim for &pound;5 each (RRP &pound;7.99) I also bought a Stargate Comic because it basically looked *awful*<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dwg8h/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 193px; height: 298px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dwg8h/s640x480"" /></a><br /><br />I&nbsp;assume that's supposed to be Daniel on the cover, event though his glasses are the wrong shape and he has Spock Eyebrows.

So many moments of joy when you realise who someone is, or what event they are alluding to. Neil Gaiman is just a genius. *gushes*<br /><br />I put off writing this review for a little while because all the AT4W watching I'd been doing had made my inner reviewer voice sound rather like Linkara... not obsessed, not obsessed, not obsessed. So now I've had a little bit of a break from watching them,  I thought I&nbsp;would bring you:<br /><lj-cut text=""Another Year (2010)""><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1431181/"">Another Year (2010)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dx2bz/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 115px; height: 164px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dx2bz/s640x480"" /></a><br /><br /><br />This film was on my list because I&nbsp;had seen the trailer for it and it looked like a nice, gentle People Stand About In Rooms And Talk About Their Feelings sort of drama, and I never got round to seeing it at the cinema. <br />And yes, what I&nbsp;thought it was was exactly what it was. It follows the main couple, Tom and Gerri, through the seasons as they deal with their friends' and family's crises. Not much happens, a few people get their hearts broken and life goes on. An enjoyable, meandering story, but not necessarily one I feel compelled to watch again. <br />Mostly notable for two things:<br />1) One of the characters is from Crawley, which is revealed thusly:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My car broke down on the motorway on the way to Brighton and <span class=""status-body""><span class=""status-content""><span class=""entry-content"">I got towed to Crawley, which is the last place I want to go cos I grew&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up there and I hate it</span></span></span>&quot;<br /><br />So you know, pretty accurate. So I spent the rest of the film thinking &quot;well she doesn't <em>sound</em> like she's from Crawley.&quot; But she was the most annoying character in the film. So you know, pretty accurate. She was one of those absolutely neurotic, wrapped up in themselves, everything that ever happens to them becomes a drama people. The sort who is just <em>exhausting</em> to be friends with. The kind where you sometimes wonder why in godmotheringfuck you are even friends with them in the first place. <br /><br />2) It doesn't end. This is my number one pet hate of these kinds of films. The story doesn't end. It just finishes. There is no conclusion. No closure. I know it's supposed to signify that life goes on, that time is an endless circle and that we have seen but a slice of the life of these characters and they will continue, as will we all, in the same comfortable rut that we have always been in, and other such pretentious bollocks, but it just irritates the fuck out of me. This film ends with a bunch of the characters sitting around the table chatting, as we zoom in on the Neurotic One as she realises that all her hopeful little fantasies about her friends' son (did I mention that? Yeah, she was in love with Tom and Gerri's son, and thought that they had a <em>connection.</em> And is thus heartbroken when he brings home his girlfriend. It's not completely creepy, as he is in his 30s and she is late 40s, early 50s, but she's known him since he was 10, which brings the creepy right back) were never going to happen and that she will be alone. FOREVER. Fade to black. It's just so... unsatisfying. You can end a film whilst still implying that life goes on. You can conclude a story and still show there are more to tell. Why just finish your film, practically mid sentence. It's like they writer just couldn't think of an ending.<br /><br />All in all, a pleasant film, but please dear god, end your films properly!</lj-cut>"

"event","As previously mentioned, I've been on a bit of a comics kick just recently. I blame Thor. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""In which there is a small amount of picspammaging and large amounts of squee"">So let me see, in the last few weeks I have: finally finished reading New Avengers, re-read most of the Steve/Tony fic I&nbsp;have bookmarked, written some fic myself, decided to start watching the entirety of Atop The 4th Wall, started reading House of M (and being <em>happy </em>about it because it means Steve and Tony are back together! YAY! Also snerking at Professor X and Magneto and looking forward to X-Men: First Class even more because of it) and discovered that 2am, me and Amazon.co.uk are 3 things that shouldn't mix. Despite wanting to buy <em>all the things</em> I was very good and only bought 3 Marvel Essentials books. I&nbsp;wanted to get Avengers Vol. 1 but it was out of stock but I&nbsp;decided to order it anyway. Instead I thought I&nbsp;would also order Avengers Vol. 2 because that was in stock, but only had a few copies left so I wanted to get it before they ran out. However, because I&nbsp;didn't want to start at Vol. 2, I&nbsp;needed something that would tide me over until Vol.1 arrived. So I also ordered Captain America Vol.1. This seemed a perfectly logical progression of ideas at the time. Now... eh.<br />Anywho, so after a small amount of package wrangling (they were too big to fit through the letterbox), I picked them up today.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dpp7z/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dpp7z"" style=""width: 319px; height: 207px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />Yay! Shiny!<br /><br />So anyway, I started reading Captain America this morning. It is everything you would want from Silver Age Captain America. Seriously, page 3 and this happens:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dq3gr/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dq3gr/s640x480"" style=""width: 200px; height: 308px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />Need I say more? It's also fun looking at the covers because, since these are Tales of Suspense issues, you also get the concurrent Iron Man covers. It's quite fun playing &quot;guess the story&quot; from the title and cover. Some day, I'm gonna have to get the Iron Man book with the corresponding stories in to play match up with. <br />Although, I'd also be quite interested to read about the adventures of Iron Captain and Man America<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dr51t/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dr51t"" style=""width: 304px; height: 197px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><br />The stories are ridiculous but fun. Apart from the hideously racist one where Cap rescues a pilot from those awful Chinese Commies in Vietnam and fights a Sumo Wrestler. Yeah...<br />And at the moment they're retelling the adventures of Captain America and Bucky during the Second World War, so there are lots of Nazis who go around talkink like zis mit ze most ridiculous accents effer vitnessed outside of an episode of&nbsp; 'Allo 'Allo.<br />And&nbsp; Cap has a penchant for standing like this:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ds9wr/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ds9wr"" style=""width: 299px; height: 194px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />He's going to do himself a mischief if he's not careful.<br /><br />But he's Cap and I love him. There is something so awesome about him taking on foes armed with just a shield. And I love how his fights are all about technique and style and not just pounding on your enemy until they give up because you're stronger than them. Whilst spouting awesome quips like this: <br /><span class=""status-body""><span class=""status-content""><span class=""entry-content""><br /></span></span></span><span class=""entry-content""> </span><em><span class=""entry-content"">Take it  easy with that gun, fella! If you stole it from the weapons room, it's  government property! You're </span><span class=""status-body""><span class=""status-content""><span class=""entry-content"">wasting the *taxpayer's* bullets!</span></span></span></em><span class=""status-body""><span class=""meta entry-meta""><a href=""http://twitter.com/niblick_iii/status/71909290490863616"" rel=""bookmark"" class=""entry-date""></a></span></span><em><span class=""status-body""><span class=""meta entry-meta"">        </span>      </span></em><br /><br />So, yeah, my love for Steve Rogers increases. (SO&nbsp;CANNOT&nbsp;WAIT&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;THE&nbsp;FILM)<br /><br />And then in town today, I discover that WHSmiths are doing a 3 for 2 offer on all books. Including all Graphic Novels. After realising I had a &pound;5 off voucher that I'd left at home, I decided to make the round trip back to my flat to pick it up so that I could justify to myself buying these books. (Also to pick up some dry cleaning I had forgotten in the first place). My main reason for this is simple. They had 1602. I don't think I&nbsp;was ever going to not buy that, was I? After nearly half an hour of agonising I decided to also get Secret War and Civil War. So I guess they can also tide me over until Avengers Vol 1 turns up.<span class=""status-body""><span class=""status-content"">           </span></span><br /></lj-cut><br />I guess you might like to pretend to be interested in what non-comics related things I've been up to? Well the answer is not really much work, that's for sure. Last week I spent 2 1/2 days at the Annual Graduate Conference, which was pretty fun, although I wasn't particularly impressed with the hotel. The organisers were amazingly innovative though, interrupting a rather boring keynote speech by fake kidnapping the speaker and then playing a video that showed all the company's senior management getting fake kidnapped too. The next day was spent doing activities to &quot;train us to help rescue the VPs&quot; which basically meant a day doing fun &quot;team building&quot; activities and playing with some of our company's tech. It was pretty cool. <br /><br />Unfortunately, about two hours after I got back on the Friday I was ill. Not sure if it was food poisoning from the hotel's lunch buffet (although that was about 6 hours previous) or just some unfortunately timed bug. I spent most of Saturday in bed, sleeping and running a temperature. Luckily, I had recovered enough by the evening to go and see Avenue Q! YAY! And proving that laughter is the best medicine, I was feeling pretty much 100% again by the time I got home.<br />Show was, as ever, brilliant. There was a nice little local touch too. During The Money Song, after they get back from collecting from the audience, Brian pulls a piece of paper out of a hat and says &quot;All I've got is this degree certificate from Oxford University. That's not worth anything!&quot; Cue gales of laughter. Made me smile. <br /><br />And then this week I&nbsp;spent one day on a training course, and a morning in a meeting, which we managed to stretch into having a site tour and meeting my dad for coffee. <br /><br />So yeah, between the conference, meetings, training course, bank holidays and just plain me having time off, I won't have worked a full week in the office from the beginning of April til the middle of June. Further, I will not have worked more than 3 1/2 days a week in the entire month of May. Nice work if you can get it.<br /><br />And finally, I watched another Love Film film:<br /><lj-cut text=""Speed Racer (2008)""><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080/"">Speed Racer (2008)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dt8t1/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dt8t1"" style=""width: 212px; height: 100px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />This was on my list because Roger Allam was in it. It's based on the cartoon of the same name, although I only know that because the cartoon's theme song is a musical motif in the film, and I only know what <em>that </em>sounds like because Ted's Band (The Worthless Peons if you cared) sing it on Scrubs. It's a film aimed at 8 year old boys, which, quite frankly, is a shame, because when it forgets this fact, it's actually a fairly decent family film, that managed to surprise me a couple of times plot wise. But then it remembers and pokes something irritating in our faces. Mostly in the form of the younger brother of the (bland, oh so incredibly bland) protagonist and his pet chimpanzee. Why he has a chimp is <em>never </em>commented on. <br /><br />The plot is... umm... so in the future (or an alternate reality, it's never explained) motor racing is *huge* and cars are magic, able to get into crashes without blowing up, bounce over their opponents and follow really ridiculous tracks that involve <em>turning upside-down</em>.  And then there is this kid who is as good as his dead brother and he races for his dad's independent company but one of the big names in racing want to sign him and actually the races are fixed in order to make more money for the companies involved and Speed Racer (yes that is his <em>actual name</em>) is setting out to fight for fairness and not betray his father and seek revenge for his brother and... aw who cares, SHINY&nbsp;CARS&nbsp;GO&nbsp;VROOM! The plot is convoluted, but kind of engaging, even if you forget it as soon as the credits roll. And only almost entirely predictable. Roger Allam has scenery for lunch, breakfast and dinner, <em>completely</em> enjoying himself and giving it the full panto villain, which is one of the things that prevents this movie from being utterly crap.<br />Stylistically, the film employs a kind of heightened reality with it's colour scheme that is very Tim Burton-esque. Very similar to Pushing Daisies; lots of bright primary colours and stuff. Which only makes Speed seem more bland.<br /><br />In summary, not too awful kid's film, that would have been better if they stopped pandering to the 8 year old boys in the audience. Then it would have had more global appeal.</lj-cut>"

I&rsquo;ve had a review I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write since the middle of April and haven&rsquo;t got round to yet (admittedly, only some of that can be blamed on busy, the rest is me being lazy) and I&rsquo;ve just added a second one.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""So whyfore have I been so busy?""><p class=""MsoNormal"">So, whyfore have I been so busy? Well, let me see, first off was Mothers Day at the beginning of April, so I was in Crawley visiting the mater. Then it was back to Cambridge Sunday night, then <i style="""">back</i> down to Crawley Monday evening as I had a two day training course Tuesday and Wednesday. Quite useful it is that I work for a company who have headquarters in my home town. Though would have been more useful had the course started on a Monday&hellip; Course was interesting, although was never going to compete with the Lake District, and frankly, I couldn&rsquo;t really see it&rsquo;s relevance to my day job. But still.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So, Wednesday night back to Cambridge, only to have a half day on Friday so that I can go back down south to see the show my step mum was in. It&rsquo;s a most unfortunate fact that all the time I was at university, she always managed to be in shows during exams, or during Fresher&rsquo;s week or at some other time that meant I couldn&rsquo;t get back to see it, whereas practically all of my dad&rsquo;s and brother&rsquo;s shows fell during the holidays, or in the middle of term when I was going home anyway. I always felt bad, as if my step mum might think it was a deliberate snub, when it <i style="""">completely</i> wasn&rsquo;t, hence moving heaven and earth to get back to see it. Especially as I would get to see both my brother&rsquo;s and my dad&rsquo;s shows later in the month, but more of that later.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">The show was an Olde Tyme Music Hall, and was absolutely fantastic. There were a lot of old faces that I hadn&rsquo;t seen in a while, people I&rsquo;ve known since I was four, so that was lovely. Fantastic songs, hilarious sketches, including one guy doing two Ronnie Barker monologues absolutely wonderfully (and did occasion a most amusing moment when I overheard two ladies next to me remark &ldquo;oo, it&rsquo;s just like something out of The Two Ronnies, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;)</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">But I couldn&rsquo;t stay for long as that Saturday was when I was to do my Swimamajig for Marie Curie Cancer Care. So Saturday afternoon, back on the train I hopped, back to Cambridge, ready to swim at 6pm. And I did it; I swam 1.5km in 54:37; a whole <i style="""">ten minutes </i>faster than my previous best time. I&rsquo;m rather proud of myself, as you may be able to tell. And they gave me a medal:</p>&nbsp;  <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ddps2/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ddps2/s640x480"" style=""width: 106px; height: 161px;"" alt="""" /></a><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

Put like that it sounds very posh, but it really wasn&rsquo;t. At my course in the Lake District, we were all assigned a Facilitated Learning Group, which is basically a group of (in my case) 10 grads and we&rsquo;re supposed to meet up 5 times before September to discuss career plans and yadda and yadda. We also have to do a challenge of some kind at some point. Anyway, there is me, The Other Grad, about 6 guys from the London office, and a guy from Belfast. Obviously, we had to have meeting in Belfast, as it just wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to expect him to fly over here every time. It was our first one, and as no one else wanted to do it, I volunteered. Meeting was long and boring, but still, it was in Belfast, so was pretty damn cool.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Belfast is&hellip; interesting. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s a place I really want to go to again, although I can&rsquo;t really judge the place on the 24 hours I spent there. However, driving to the hotel in the taxi, we noticed we were driving towards a large mural painted on the side of a building, informing us we were about to enter a unionist part of the city. May as well have been a big sign saying &ldquo;Fuck off English&rdquo;. Thankfully, we turned away from it, but we were still rather too close for my liking. And then we discovered that the hotel we were staying in had previously been bombed by the IRA. So that was uplifting. On the other hand, my room came with a rubber ducky!</p>&nbsp;  <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ded9s/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ded9s/s640x480"" style=""width: 134px; height: 207px;"" alt="""" /></a><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

It&rsquo;s the most uncomfortable I&rsquo;ve ever felt in a place, I think. Still, we ended up in a pub where some people were playing traditional Irish music, so that was pretty cool.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;Anyway, meeting over Wednesday afternoon, back to the airport we go. Oh yeah, and this is the trip I realise I have a little bit of a thing for one of the London Guys (he&rsquo;s tall, Scottish and a bit musical, are you really surprised?)</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;So the Friday wasn&rsquo;t exactly busy, but it was the day I met the new grad we have hired who starts in September. He has the same name as The Other Grad, and The Guy, so that&rsquo;s nice and easy to remember.  And not confusing at all. He seems like he might be a little boring, but we took him to lunch with everyone and he wasn&rsquo;t intimidated by the more &hellip; ponderously geeky members of staff. I think he might be one of those Serious Geeks though, which could damp my fun a little. He is also sorta nicknamed miniature!Tony Stark, because he sorta looks like him.  But with the good bits taken out. The Other Grad bet me &pound;5 I couldn&rsquo;t slip an Iron Man reference into our conversation. This is made harder by the fact that he&rsquo;s only seen the film. I managed it, but it was neither elegant, nor amusing, so he only game me &pound;2, but nevertheless, I made a profit that day!</p>Then that weekend I went to <lj user=""nevaendinstorey""/>&nbsp;&rsquo;s for her birthday and saw <lj user=""plum177""/>&nbsp;, <lj user=""bethan_b_bad""/>&nbsp;, <lj user=""requiem2adream""/>&nbsp; and <lj user=""bloodrunner666""/>&nbsp;.

<![endif]-->  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So then Wednesday I finished work and went on holiday for 13 days. It was lush. And where the me being busy excuse for not updating runs out and the me being lazy excuse kicks in.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Thursday was my step dad&rsquo;s birthday, and then in the evening I went to see my darling brother in Joseph and his Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat. It&rsquo;s not my favourite show, but this was very good. It was all kids from his drama school thing (it&rsquo;s one of those weekend things where they learn singing and dancing and acting, not quite a drama club, but not exactly a school either) and other branches in the area and they had a week&rsquo;s workshop to put but the show together. A <i style="""">week</i>. It was brilliant. My brother was Potiphar and had to wear a fat suit, and I discovered that not only can he sing and dance and act, but he has apparently inherited my dad&rsquo;s funny gene. And the pratfall gene. He absolutely had me in hysterics, with this really odd posh voice that I didn&rsquo;t even know he could do. There were some other brilliant kids in the show too.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">After that, I mostly bummed around, having a BBQ at my Nan&rsquo;s on Easter Sunday, having an old school sleep over round my friends&rsquo; on Sunday night and going to the cinema.</p>      <p class=""MsoNormal"">Thursday night was my dad&rsquo;s turn. He was in The Wizard of Oz. He was a crow in the first act and a rather camp Emerald City Guard in the second act. And in my not biased at all opinion he stole the show a little bit. Him and The Great And Powerful Oz. They just both had more energy and life than pretty much anyone in the cast. Well, I guess the dog they had playing Toto was a little show stealy as well. Very cute and very well behaved, despite being manhandled all over the shop. The Wicked Witch was delightfully over the top, and had proper Crazy Eyes.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Then we get to Friday. Ah Friday. Me and 5 other brave (or is that foolhardy) souls went to London, not to see the Royal Wedding, but to go to a recording of Cabin Pressure, which is only my favourite radio sitcom ever, about a small charter airline called MJN air. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Roger Allam, Stephanie Cole and the genius that is John Finnemore, who also writes it. I first got into it as part of the La Cage Aux Folles obsession, but it is so unbelievably funny, that I got hooked. I can&rsquo;t really describe how brilliant it was, you&rsquo;ll just have to listen to it when it airs in July. I think the last time I laughed so hard was, well, listening to the Cabin Pressure Christmas Special. Sheer, unadulterated awesome.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Anyway, after that, we found ourselves heading in the direction of the palace anyway, so decided to go and see what all the fuss was about. Didn&rsquo;t really get to see anything, but hey, I can say I was there!</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">And then Saturday, back on a train (again!), this time to Cardiff. And most excellent it was too. We cooked meat on a fire and watched the Royal Wedding, on iplayer, fast forwarding through the boring bits and playing the Royal Wedding Drinking Game which was mostly rules we made up as and when we felt like it. On Sunday, probably, we went to see Thor which was *awesome* and I need to see it again. Also saw trailers for Captain America which was even more awesome as well as Pirates of the Caribbean (not as awesome but has Roger Allam in it) and X-Men: First Class which looks ridiculous and fun and kind of awesome.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">And then Tuesday it was back home in time for work on Wednesday.<br />&nbsp;</p></lj-cut><p class=""MsoNormal"">Phew. That took rather longer than anticipated.</p>      <p class=""MsoNormal"">Also this month my obsession with The Axis of Awesome, and especially Benny, the keyboard player, continues to grow. Their songs are just awesome and he is just so cute! Look! He's asleep! In a hat!<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dfrc6/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dfrc6"" style=""width: 346px; height: 259px;"" alt="""" /></a><br />&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">After that brief break with sanity, I guess it's on to the reviews!</p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

This one a little more recent.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was a very silly romantic comedy. Matthew Perry is a process server who has to serve Liz Hurley with divorce papers. She runs away, and when he catches up, as the divorce would be better for her if she serves her husband first, they make a deal that he will not file the papers and help her serve her husband in return for&hellip; &lt;doctor evil voice&gt; &pound;1<em> million </em>dollars!<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>&lt;/doctor evil voice&gt;</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Thus begins a Mad Cap Romp from New York to Texas where Wacky Hijinks occur and the inevitable happens and they fall in love.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So far, so ridiculous rom com plot line. Not something that would actually happen, but at least grounded in a reality of a sort. However, there are just a few little odd moments that completely screw with your suspension of disbelief and leave you going &ldquo;oh come on, that is so beyond ridiculous, that would <i style="""">never, never</i> happen in real life.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">The first of these is that Matthew Perry grows wine in his apartment. Wine. In his apartment. Apparently he really wants his own vineyard, but as he can&rsquo;t afford it, he has to make do with his apartment.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">On it&rsquo;s own, not too terrible, and probably something you could overlook if it wasn&rsquo;t for the rest of it.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">The second is one of the Wacky Hijinks that occur at an airport and involve our heroes getting onto that bit where they weigh your luggage and send it to the plane and end up in the big bit where they sort all of the suitcases. It&rsquo;s like that scene from Toy Story 2. It makes no sense. There is no way in any reality that they would be able to do that. Oh yeah, and then she empties a whole bunch of suitcases in order to steal some clothes. How pissed off would you be if that was your holiday?</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">The final is The Husband&rsquo;s Bodyguard. A large black guy who dresses like a cowboy. Complete with snakeskin shoes. That still have the heads of the snakes on. The first time we see him, he is in a basement and has a whimpering man in office wear tied to a pole and is threatening him with serious physical torture. And what does the poor tortured man say? &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the stapler is!&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">I mean seriously what? You expect me to believe that this dude has a guy on his payroll who tortures people to find out <i style="""">the location of office equipment</i>. It&rsquo;s just ridiculous. It&rsquo;s the straw that breaks the camels back. Once I see how ridiculous this is, I can&rsquo;t help but notice all the normal ridiculous bits that I would normally ignore or let slide. Movie, you made me question your inner reality too deeply and you broke it.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">One the good side, the movie also contains Matthew Perry in a tux with Designer Stubble. And he was something of a Bad Boy so got to smoke and wear a leather jacket and have spiky hair. And apparently (according to my live tweeting) a coat and scarf combination that looked like it walked off of the cover of GQ.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">So, in summary, a decently ok rom com ruined by just <i style="""">being too ridiculous</i>.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p></lj-cut><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Secondly,<br />&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Wolf""><p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111742/"">Wolf (1994)</a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dhwer/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 136px; height: 206px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dhwer/s640x480"" /></a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">This has James Spader in it. Also Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer. And David Hyde Pierce. And in a blink-and-you&rsquo;ll-miss-it role, Alison Janney.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;This is a werewolf movie. This is not a horror movie. I think the imdb summary sums it up best &ndash; &ldquo;Publisher Will Randall becomes a werewolf and has to fight to keep his job.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">That&rsquo;s right. A character becomes a werewolf and the film is mostly about the struggle he has keeping his job as editor of a large publishing house. It&rsquo;s a&hellip; I guess it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;people stand around in rooms and talk about their feelings&rdquo; film.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;Basic plot: Jack Nicholson runs over a wolf and gets bit. He slowly changes into a werewolf. He discovers James Spader has been having an affair with his wife and bites him. Later on he kills his wife. He has an almost relationship with Michelle Pfeiffer. James Spader also turns into a werewolf. They fight. Some people die. James Spader is shot. Jack Nicholson&hellip; possibly runs off to live in the woods. It is implied that Michelle Pfeiffer is somehow also a werewolf. The film ends.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;And that&rsquo;s it. It is almost definitely the most boring werewolf movie you will ever see. The thing is, I would much rather watch James Spader&rsquo;s story. Not just because he is pretty. I mean, he is, but that&rsquo;s not why. I just think that his is a much more interesting story. The proper werewolf horror movie story. You don&rsquo;t really get to see him much, but you get the feeling<i style=""""> he </i>was the one who went on mad killing rampages and killed teenagers in forests.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;Also, Jack Nicholson is just <i style="""">fucking creepy</i>. What with him smiling like the Joker <i style="""">all the damn time</i>. I get that that is just his normal smile, but <i style="""">who the fuck smiles like the joker all the time???</i> Also, early on I decided he looked like a Zombie Dean Stockwell, and now I can&rsquo;t unsee it.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dkqe7/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 296px; height: 125px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dkqe7"" /></a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">And now you won't&nbsp; be able to either...<br /><br />Tattoo watch: alas, no. *sadface*<br />Summary: I never thought werewolves could be so <i style="""">boring</i>.</p></lj-cut><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>"

That was long and boring but at least I&nbsp;was writing about something concrete. Something with substance. My report is a page full of Reacher Guilt words and phrases. I will admit that watching The West Wing whilst writing didn't exactly help my concentration, but I find myself in the the position of being unable to care. I'll go back and look at it later, maybe rework it, and then get my mentor to look at it and tell me it's all waffle and no substance and I've done it wrong. <br />Also I spent nearly 5 hours yesterday tidying my flat. Ok, so mostly this because I hadn't cleaned in probably about a month, but still! EXTREME&nbsp;CLEANING!<br /><br />Went swimming this morning. This is the second time in three days that I have swam 1.5km. In three days I have swam 3km. I am awesome. Ok, so I was totally making up for missing two week's worth of training swims, but still.

It was *amazeballs*. Last Friday I managed to get last minute tickets for&nbsp; Roger Daltrey performing Tommy at the Royal Albert Hall on Thursday night for the Teenage Cancer Trust. I uhmmed and ahhed for a little bit because the tickets were (with delivery and booking charges) about &pound;40, and it was a Thursday and that meant running to London directly after work, not getting back till late and then going to work the next day. Until I realised I was trying to decide whether to see <em>Roger Daltrey perform Tommy at the Royal Albert Hall</em>. I mean seriously. How many more chances was I going to get? And how much closer was I going to get to actually seeing The Who live? So I went for it. And I'm so glad I did. I wish I had thought to take my camera so that I could have got pictures or video or something. But wow. WOW. He still has it. The voice. The stage presence. The absolute ROCK. The man has seriously raised swinging a microphone to an absolute *art form* And as if my night couldn't get any better, Pete Townshend came on stage to sing The Acid Queen which is probably my second favourite song on the whole album. And to play as well. And well, if you haven't seen Pete Townshend play a guitar you, my friend, have missed out. And I don't mean the whole showboating, windmilling anarchy, although that is very impressive, I just mean the sheer skill with which he plays. Don't believe me? Just watch his playing in this:<br /><lj-embed id=""19""/><br /><br /> Then there was about a half hour encore which was kind of The Who's Greatest Hits, and Pete Townshend came on for Baba O'Riley. Then we <em>did</em> get to see the proper full on windmilling rocking out. I was just so happy. I saw my favourite band play live, and with half of them dead and those that remain past retirement age it could have been awful, but it wasn't. It was just rock.<br /><br />Anyway, last night I watched<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/"">Pulp Fiction (1994)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dchr9/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dchr9"" style=""width: 198px; height: 133px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />So this is another one of those films where people just look at you blankly when you say you haven't seen it. It is also #5 on the imdb top 250. I enjoyed it very much, which I wasn't sure I would, I must admit. I would say I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it, but it reminded me a lot of Lock, Stock whilst I was watching it, so I don't think the surprise is that great. I would say this film was compelling. You didn't want your attention to drift for a minute in case you missed something. I suppose kind of nothing happens in it, but, frankly, who cares? I loved the time jumps.&nbsp; It's getting to be one of my favourite tropes. I love well constructed narratives that shift timelines, either teasing you with things that happened and then going back to explain them later or&nbsp; picking up on something inconsequential that you saw earlier and expanding it. I didn't explain that very well I guess, but you know what I mean. I love stories that start at the end or the middle and then go back and fill you in on what happened in between. It only works if you can still follow the plot and if the narrative leads you there and makes it clear where in time you are. I think Aaron Sorkin introduced me to it. Some of his best episodes of well, anything are when he does that. The Social Network manages superbly. And so does Pulp Fiction. I really love the way that the narrative ends about 2/3 of the way through the film, and the film ends about halfway through the story. It's a really nice way to shake up your expectations and keep you on your toes. It was all very good. I don't think I can say that it moved me, or that it has immediately hopped up in my pantheon of all time greatest films but it was very good and I would certainly watch it again."

"event","My training course in the Lake District was absolutely fantastic. It was incredibly intense, including travel time, it was four 12 hour days. I could cope with the concentration, just not so much the full on being with people. Spending 12 hours a day with my friends? Fine, but even then I start to crave my own space. Spending 12 hours a day with colleagues? With colleagues I barely knew? By the end of the four days I just couldn't wait to, well do what I did this weekend, hide away from people in my flat and do very little. But all of that, <em>all of that</em> was completely worth it for what we actually did. I canoed across Lake Windermere. Let me say that again: I&nbsp;CANOED&nbsp;ACROSS&nbsp;LAKE&nbsp;WINDERMERE. I'm not entirely sure why I'm quite so proud of this but I am. It was something I really wanted to try and I&nbsp;did it. I think the reason&nbsp; I'm so proud is that I did good at physical activity. I can<em> never</em> do good at physical activity. The really active guy, the one who did climbing and had been canoeing before, was impressed and surprised that I&nbsp;hadn't canoed before. I kept up with the guys and canoed every stroke.&nbsp; *shrug* Also I <em>really</em> enjoyed it. Out on the water, in the sun. It was lovely. I also climbed a hill in the morning. We were above the clouds and looked down at the lake in the valley. There were other challenges, but they're rather harder to explain. Lots of team building, lots of problem solving. And the best bit of it. We <em>got paid to do it</em>. Standing on a hill, looking at this beautiful country that I&nbsp;live in, the sun shining down on me, and <em>I got paid for it</em>.<br /><br />Anyway, now on to my next Love Film review.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1319694/"">Glorious 39 (2009)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000db83e/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000db83e"" style=""width: 168px; height: 168px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />This was a David Tennant film. I was surprised in the first instance that it was a period drama where David Tennant was allowed to be Scottish. Posh Scottish (they don't sound like us &lt;/ obscure Cabin Pressure reference&gt;), but Scottish, nonetheless. I must admit to being a tiny bit disappointed (I enjoy his Upper Class Twit accent), but then he said &quot;doom&quot; and I&nbsp;was happy. And he wore a tux. And I was very happy. He was only in the first 20 minutes at most. I wouldn't have expected that from the DVD cover. However, Glorious 39 was a very good good film. It was rather a head fucky film, a, and I&nbsp;hate to fall in to &quot;film review language&quot;, but it was a &quot;taught thriller&quot;. One of those films that is just ever so slightly unsettling because you share the character's disorientation. Despite being absolutely nothing like it, plotwise, it reminded me an awful lot of Donnie Darko. The viewing experience was very similar. A good film, a very good film."

I'm really looking forward to it now. It's all a bit of a mystery and none of us really no what to expect. Not even the people who've already done this training course will tell us what's going to happen.<br />That's what I should be doing. Instead, I'm writing a review of the film I watched last night:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307507/"">The Stickup (2002)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dawc6/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000dawc6"" style=""width: 229px; height: 171px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />This was an awesome film. I can't really say much about it because, well, it's a thriller. One where the plot twists are absolutely integral. All I can say is that it involves a bank in Nowheresville, Some State, being robbed and the investigation into it. And James Spader looking awesome in sunglasses (see above). There is also a green FBI agent who isn't a total moron, which, like, <em>never</em> happens in films not about the FBI. Very nicely done film, it plays with the timeline of events to help keep the suspense, jumping around in flashbacks of various lengths of time ago. I&nbsp;think it was this that made me realise that James Spader in something written by Aaron Sorkin would be beyond awesome. Can that happen, please universe? Also, James Spader is topless a few times and there are fleeting glimpses of tattoo. *grin*<br />All in all a very good film. It goes on the list.<br /><br />The fact that I&nbsp;ate breakfast whilst writing this totally counts as productivity, right? Right?!<br /><br />"

"event","A review for the film I watched last night which was on my list because Matthew Perry was in it.<br />The film was:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095736/"">A Night In The Life of Jimmy Reardon (1988)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d8cdy/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 205px; height: 205px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d8cdy"" /></a><br /><br />Ok, so this was *so* totally not the film I was expecting to watch. Look at that DVD cover and what sort of film do you imagine? I think you could be forgiven for thinking, as I did, that what you were about to experience was a late 80s teen movie set in a high school and probably involving jocks. And a prom. Or something. *Not* what this film is about. The film starts by displaying a Aldous Huxley quote: <em>&quot;Our goal is to discover that we have always been where we ought to be. Unhappily we make the task exceedingly difficult for ourselves</em>&quot;<br />It was at this point I realised I may have been wrong in my assumptions. Actually, this isn't true. At <em>this</em> point I&nbsp;just figured I was in for a particularly pretentious 80s teen movie. Turns out, that contrary to what the cover picture would have you believe, this film is actually set in the 60s and is based on the book <em>Aren't You Even Gonna Kiss Me Goodbye?</em> by William Richert, who directed the film. <br />It stars River Phoenix as a 17 year old who has just graduated high school and is getting ready to go off to college. Well, he is supposedly 17, but he looks about 12, which gets particularly skeevy later on as we shall see. His family is... well... if he was British, he'd be lower middle class. Not much money, his father went to college and has a steady white collar job. His friends (Matthew Perry among them) are <em>obscenely </em>rich. The living in mansions with tennis courts kinds of rich. It's at this point I should point out that the first thing we see of Matthew Perry is he is playing pool or snooker or billiards or something. I didn't exactly notice because he was <em>wearing a fez</em>. For no adequately explored reason. He's just. Wearing a fez. The fez distracted me so much that I didn't at the time notice just how very very *young* Matt Perry looks. You know how young he looks in early Friends? Well this was <em>six years</em> before that. Photographic proof you say? Very well.<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d9dzy/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 320px; height: 208px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d9dzy"" /></a><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""And now... spoilers"">So, the plot. Well. River Phoenix is going steady with Obscenely Rich girl Lisa. But he has slept with a girl who has conned him out of money by pretending she needed an abortion so he now no longer has the $110 he needs to go to the college of his choice. His father will only pay if he goes to his Alma Mater. I think there is a thing where he wants to be a poet and his dad want him to go to business school but it's not very clear. So he decides that rather than do that, he'll go and... er grow pineapples in Hawaii because that's where his girlfriend is going. Except that he doesn't have any money. And his father won't give him any. So now, instead he has to raise $80ish dollars for a plane fare.<br />Oh yeah, he has also been having... some sort of fuck buddies relationship with another of their obscenely rich friends, because... uh... I dunno actually. Possibly because she likes kinky sex and he is a randy fucker. Well... slightly kinky role playing anyway.&nbsp; This is rather skeevy because seriously, he looks 12 and she doesn't look much older. So River runs around trying to get this money before his girlfriend leaves. Then his mother asks hims to drive home a friend of hers of whom his father Disapproves. He is not happy about this because he is about to go out with his girlfriend and it's the night before she leaves. So obviously, he drives the friend home and has sex with her instead of seeing his girlfriend. As you do. He then goes to pick up said gf, only to discover that she's got sick of waiting and went with the sickeningly handsome and rich boy next door. So he storms the party they're at and they have a heated argument.&nbsp; She then decides that even though he was hours late she should forgive him and follow through with her plan to &quot;go all the way&quot;. However, he can't get it up, due to having all the sex with his mum's friend. She calls him on it, revealing that she knew he was a cheating douchebag and yet stayed with him and then decides, she planned to lose her virginity that night, and lose her virginity she will, by jingo!And she doesn't care who with. So she flounces off to Boy Next Door. River gets all annoyed because, god dammit, there is only room for one cheating ho in this relationship and it will damn well be him! In his fit of annoyance he accidentally crashes his Dad's car which causes him to discover that the reason his dad disapproved of the friend was that he was having an affair with her. This somehow makes him bond with his dad because... err... maybe because they've had sex with the same woman and if that's the case it's just <em>wrong</em>. But anyway he decides to do what his dad wants and go to the business school. The end.<br />*shrug* I'm not really sure. There was what was attempting to be a subplot about him being a performance poet sort of thing, and I guess in the directors cut more is made of it but it isn't really mentioned.<br />I can't believe I missed one of the most notable bits of this film: it's narrated by River Phoenix's character. In this really weird half pretentious nobend half film noir detective way. It's just kind of odd.<br />So, conclusions? A very weird little film. Not what I expected at all. River Phoenix is good, but looks far too young to be having that much sex. And Matt Perry needs to be in it more.<br /></lj-cut>"

"event","Just in case you were wondering (and I know you hang on my every word with baited breath, don't you? Don't you...?) I hadn't forgotten my plan to review every love film film that I watch. The last 3 discs I've been sent have been The Man From U.N.C.L.E. which I decided didn't count as it was a TV show. Even if the DVDs themselves contained films based off of the TV show. Also, I didn't want to bombard you with 5 basically identical reviews. Let me just say in summary: THRUSH *really* need to read The Evil Overlord List, Napoleon Solo is a man-whore, but I&nbsp;can't help but like him, Leo G. Carrol has *amazing* eyebrows and OMFG is David McCallum pretty. Also, I discover I have a thing for pilots. I can tell you're surprised. Also, I&nbsp;need to watch the actual series *like burning* right now. <br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d6qyh/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d6qyh"" style=""width: 345px; height: 224px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />Because everyone needs a half naked Illya Kuryakin tied up in their living room... I mean...what?<br /><br />Ahem...<br /><br /><br />So, moving on to the film I&nbsp;have just finished watching:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/"">12 Angry Men (1957)</a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d772r/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d772r"" style=""width: 233px; height: 161px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><br />This film is #7 on the imdb top 250. And rightly so. The first thing that struck me about this film was how theatrical it was. And I don't mean dramatic flourishes and over the top declaiming, I mean that the film was staged as if it were a play. Which works so incredibly well. They could have tried to make it more, shown us more than we would have seen on the stage, but it doesn't. It focusses on those 12 men stuck in that one room, trying to decide whether to kill a man or not. Any attempt to show us more about these men's lives, or showing us reconstructions of the crime would have diluted the tension of being in that room. In fact, the fact that it's a film set, not a theatre set makes it even more clautrophobic, because it's enclosed. You can see the room from every angle, feel like you're in it with those men. More films need to be treated as plays. It draws you in.&nbsp; There are some incredibly powerful scenes in this film. Every character has their moment and it is wonderful to see each of them unravel or reveal more about themselves. These 12 men, these strangers, have been put in a room to decide whether an 18 year old boy killed is father or not. And if he is found guilty, he will be sent to the chair. If they find him guilty, they will have written his death sentence. Emotional, evocative and powerful. One of my favourite scenes is when Juror #10 starts this huge bigoted rant about how the boy must be guilty because &quot;his kind&quot; have less respect for human life and so on and so forth, and one by one, the other people at the table get up and move to the edge of the room, turning their back on him or otherwise signalling that they want nothing to do with him. Very theatrical. Very powerful.<br />And that is another thing I love. None of the characters are named. They are referred to by their juror number, if at all. They don't need to be named.&nbsp; They are so incredibly individual as characters, they don't need to be uniquely identified by anything as banal as names. <br />And I think I'd better finish this review before it gets any more pretentious and wanky. And just say, they don't make 'em like this any more, they really don't. It's a slick, smooth, incredibly well written character study, and the world needs more.<br />Summary: Amazing, powerful, evocative drama at its best.<br /><br />"

Mostly it is films I have not seen.&nbsp; There are one or two I have, but don't own and a couple of tv show and games as well.<br />I am using this as a way of seeing all the films I&nbsp;haven't seen but really should. So, to that end, my list conains<br />1) All of the top 20 on the imdb top 250 films that I haven't seen<br />2) A few of the recent must sees that I missed.<br /><br />Because I am nothing if not a fan girl and lover of great and terrible indie films, I also went through some of my favourite actors and added their back catalogue. So I also have a whole bunch of films from<br />a) James Spader<br />b) Robert Downey Jr<br />c) Chris Evans<br />d) Colin Firth<br />e) Matthew Perry<br /><br />Anyway, so this is my plan:<br />As I&nbsp;enjoyed 30 days of films so much,&nbsp; I&nbsp;am going to review every film that I haven't already seen that I&nbsp;watch via Love Film. And let's just see how long I&nbsp;keep it up for.<br /><br /><br /><br />So the first film I watched was:<br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103125/""><br />True Colors (1991)</a><br /><lj-cut text=""WARNING: here be spoilers""><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d422b/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d422b/s640x480"" style=""width: 399px; height: 221px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />This was an absolutely awesome film.&nbsp; John Cusak and James Spader a best friends right through Law School. John Cusak is from a Poor Background and has Ambition and James Spader comes from a Rich Background and has Principles. John Cusak wants to bee elected to Congress and James Spader wants to become a prosecutor and Make A Difference. He also has a girlfriend who is the daughter of a Senator. John Cusak will Stop At Nothing to get what he wants, including dropping out of Law School to work for&nbsp; the Senator, stealing James Spader's girlfriend and marrying her. Anyway, this is where Mandy My Name Is Inigo Montoya You Killed My Father Perpare To Die Patinkin comes in. He is a Corrupt Businessman (and I wouldn't be surprised if he also had Mob Connections) and offers to fund John Cusak's campaign. For A Price. So, having sold his soul, John Cusak proceeds to screw over anyone he ever knew in order to reach the top. In retaliation for having his career severly curtiled by John Cusak's screwing, James Spader then volunteers to work undercover on John Cusak's campaign and thus Take Him Down From The Inside. <br />Another film where James Spader has *way* more chemistry with his male co star than his Designate Love Interest. The intensity of their relationship in the first half of the film just makes the unravelling of it in the second half all the more interesting to watch. <br />Tattoo watch: not seen, but the cause of James Spader's character rather bizarrely having sex half wearing a dressing gown, ie one arm in, one arm out.</lj-cut><br />"

"event","So you know how I&nbsp;said in my last post that there were a couple of incidents on Christmas Day that were causing me some angst over a week later? Well now it's over two weeks later and the angst is back. I'm not sure it ever really went away. I told myself I&nbsp;was going to use my LJ to document the positive things going on, instead of just whinging and complaining, but right now, I really *really* need the catharsis.<br /><br />As I&nbsp;said before, it's my step dad's mum. I&nbsp;don't know why this woman has so much power over me to make me feel terrible, but I really wish she didn't. For the last few years she has managed to make me feel that I'm not family, that I was only a temporary grandchild, but now they have their proper blood related issue (my sisters), I am no longer of any consequence. Whether this is actually the case I don't know. The fact is my sisters where born just as I was changing from being a cute little kid to a teenager with absolutely nothing in common with her, so maybe it's just that she doesn't know how to relate to me. I'm sure I didn't help, her making me feel like this meant I avoided going to visit if I&nbsp;could, so I didn't exactly send out &quot;include me&quot; messages. And it was silly things that got to me. When the girls were younger she would often buy them little presents, just silly things like art sets from primark. Nothing major. And I could see that. I could see that as a teenager there's nothing really she could have got me to make me feel included. It wasn't that that got to me. Really, I wasn't. Well maybe a tiny bit. But I could have lived with it if she had once, just once acknowledged that I might feel left out, if she'd just said something, anything to suggest she'd ever thought of my existence at all. Just show that she realised that she'd exlcuded me. |But she never did. Never. <br />This is something that I have come to terms with. I can live with this fact. At the time it was something I could mostly live with. It just hit me sometimes as thoroughly unfair.<br /><br />But this time. This time she really crossed a line. I hate that she upset me this much that I am practically sobbing just typing it. With one comment she managed to cut, I guess, into my deepest insecurities. And what was this comment? Just that, in casual conversation, to me, she said something about my step dad having two daughters. That was it. I know that techincally, that's true. But I think, what about me? I know I'm not his daughter by birth, but he's helped raise me since I was 3. I spent more time with him than with my dad. Do I not count? Was I just a lodger for the 15 years I lived with him? 18, actually, as I didn't properly move out till this year.&nbsp; I just... if she was being malicious about it, that would be one thing. But I don't think she even realised what she said. She didn't even think about how I might feel about her saying it. Even if she'd referenced that he brought me up, again just showed that she *thought* about me at all. But it's not that she thinks it that really gets to me. That's not what has me on the verge of tears every time the thought enters my brain. No the thought that festers, the tought that cackles away to me in the back of my head is <em>what if she's right</em>. What if, after all these years, I don't count as important as a my sisters to my step dad. What if I'm not as good as a daughter to him? It may seem hipocritical of me, after all, I don't think of him as my dad. But that's not the point. The point is, he is as important to me as my dad, and my mum, and my stepmum. I have four parents, not two. And the thought that I might not be family, not proper family to him just leaves me in the most abject misery I have ever felt. I think the last time I felt this bad was when my grandad died.<br /><br />The thing is, intellecutally, I know, I <em>know&nbsp;</em>that it isn't the case. I know we're family. But it doesn't stop the thought buzzing around my head like a malevolent&nbsp; bee. It doesn't stop me wondering <em>what if I'm wrong?</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />I hate that this stupid, thoughtless woman has the power to make me feel like this. I hate it so much. I hate that even writing this down has left me an emotional wreck. I hate that I know that this thought is going to come back to haunt me. I hate that I have to go out and sing tonight and that if anyone asks me what's wrong I will just break down again. I hate that if I don't go I'll just spend the night dwelling and feel worse. I&nbsp;hate that I have a 40 minute bus ride each way on my own, and that the chances of me getting away with forgetting for a bit are slim. I hate that this whole situation has affected me at work and nearly made me start sobbing at my desk at least three times. And most of all I hate that I really need a hug and there's no one here to give me one."

"event","So, Christmas is over, and I'm back at work.<br /><br />It was a sort of New Year's Resolution to post more so I'm attempting just that.<br /><br />Christmas and New Year were both very good. On Christmas Eve I told my sisters they could wake me up when they opened their stockings, as long as it was after 6.30. They woke me up at 6.31. Sneaky little buggers they are. So we watched them open their presents, and then I snuck back to bed for a sneaky nap (having elected to take the last shower). After the usual Children Torture of Having To Wait For Daddy To Be Ready Before We Can Open Presents, we did, indeed open the presents.<br />No major presents this year, but then I didn't ask for any, just got some books (that I've read all of) and dvds that I asked for. Also got a few bits for the house, like a hand mixer, some tongs and a tool kit. Biggest present I got was a hoody from Superdry from my Dad and Stepmum. My Stepmum had remembered me complaining about how much I liked their clothes but how expensive they were so thought they'd get me something. Unfortunately, I've discovered it's like a gateway drug, the hoody is so awesome and comfortable that I just want *more*. <br />Anyway, after opening the presents we had a big fried breakfast and eventually went out for a walk round the local nature reserve. Not particularly enjoyable because the paths were all icy and were *treacherous* However, the lake was frozen over, and I've *never* seen that before and it was *pretty*.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d33kc/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d33kc/s640x480"" style=""width: 256px; height: 170px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />After that my Stepdad's parents and sister came over for dinner in the evening and it was a nice day (barring a couple of incidents that caused me some angst today, which I won't go into, just know it's my Stepdad's Mum again). Then boxing day was the traditional get together my Nan's. Fourteen of us this year. Good fun as usual. <br /><br />I then went to my dad's, nice to see them. Watched my dad and brother in panto which was excellent. Dad was scarily good at his first time as the Dame, you wouldn't have been able to tell.<br /><br />I had originally intended to go to an old school friend's place in Brighton for a New Year's party, but he came down with the flu, so he cancelled it. So I ended up sending the New Year with my dad, in the first time in, ... possibly ever, actually. Me, my dad, brother, stepmum and my stepmum's parents had a really nice dinner, I had pork belly ribs with a really nice bbq glaze, as did my brother, and everyone else had steak. Then we watched Carry On films and played Articualte! until midnight. It was very nice to have quiet new year for once. <br /><br />Then it was back to my mum's, back to Cambridge on Monday and back to work yesterday. Work is alright at the moment, lots of deadlines and The Other Grad is on holiday till next Monday which makes it more boring. Still one more day and it's the weekend.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and I have a new bookcase. Well, it's my old bookcase that I had in my room when I&nbsp;was 7. It's cool, all my books have shelf space now. At the weekend I'm going to get a DVD rack as well, just to get some more storage.<br /><br />And finally, as it's the New Year, and I'm no longer pinging between Cambridge and Crawley for family birthdays and stuff, I think I can say I'm thoroughly settled in, so come visit!"

<![endif]-->  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Today has been&hellip; Christmas Evey. I did the traditional icing of the Yule Log and then I made a chocolate cheesecake that I hope will be scrummy. In a bit we&rsquo;re going over my aunt&rsquo;s for a little pre-Christmas gathering, which should be fun.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So due to problems with the internet, I didn&rsquo;t get to post the post I wrote last night until this afternoon, but still, I make it time for</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">&middot;</span> Day 30 - Your favourite movie of all time</strong></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Boy howdy is this hard. I have a page of notes from when I worked out what films I would talk about, and there are a few possibilities listed and then &ldquo;GAH GAH FGAH I DON&rsquo;T KNOW THERE ARE TOO MANY TOO PICK&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">That pretty much sums it up. I like a lot of films. A lot. But I don&rsquo;t think I can put my finger on just one film that is my absolute all time favourite. How can I? I can pick my favourite action film, my favourite animated film, my favourite comedy, my favourite romance, my favourite drama. Just about. After a lot of thought and hair pulling. But how can I pick which of those is my favourite? I like all these films for different reasons? How can I compare them? It&rsquo;s like comparing apples and oranges. I have thought, and thought and tried to find a way to answer this question, but I just can&rsquo;t. So, what I think I&rsquo;ll do is I&rsquo;ll talk about all of the films on my list of possible favourites. Most of them I have already talked about with one category or another, like <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325123/"">Bright Young Things (2003)</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/"">The Lion King (1994)</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090213/"">Tuff Turf (1985)</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/"">Die Hard (1988)</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104940/"">The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)</a> and<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/""> Hot Fuzz (2007)</a>.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So, the ones I haven&rsquo;t talked about before:</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/"">Brokeback Mountain (2005)</a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d03bt/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d03bt"" style=""width: 316px; height: 208px;"" alt="""" /></a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I love this film because it&rsquo;s a nice, unhurried drama. It&rsquo;s gorgeously shot, too. All the rolling vistas and wide open spaces. The space around the characters makes the story feel more intimate. I also think the music has a special something. But, mostly, I like this film because I am an old romantic, and sometimes, you just gotta have a bit of good old romantic tragedy. Another film that makes me cry every time I see it; the shirts at the end always have me welling up. Plus Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger have fantastic chemistry that makes me sad we won&rsquo;t get to see them act together again.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796366/"">Star Trek (2009)</a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d1qd1/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d1qd1"" style=""width: 259px; height: 145px;"" alt="""" /></a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">It&rsquo;s a sci-fi action adventure romp. It has Leonard Nimoy. The cast is pretty and talented. I mean, really, what more do you want from a Star Trek reboot? I love the way that even if you don&rsquo;t really know Star Trek, it is a thoroughly enjoyable film, but that there are lots of little remarks and references and call backs to delight the long time fan. And <i style="""">yes</i>, so the plot is convoluted and a little silly, and <i style="""">yes</i>, black holes don&rsquo;t work that way, but did you ever <i style="""">see</i> the original series? I think this film really captures the spirit of the original series, whilst still making it accessible for a whole new audience</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>      <p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100405/"">Pretty Woman (1990)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d2e6t/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000d2e6t"" style=""width: 165px; height: 165px;"" alt="""" /></a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Cinderella meets Pygmalion. Julia Roberts. Richard Gere. Again, another film to delight the sappy romantic in me. This was probably the first &ldquo;grown up&rdquo; romantic comedy, and possibly my favourite of what I think of as<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>the &ldquo;Big 3&rdquo; of late 80s /early 90s rom coms &ndash; this, Dirty Dancing (), and When Harry Met Sally (). As I&rsquo;ve grown older, I can appreciate why people don&rsquo;t like it, and how much the Hooker With A Heart Of Gold stereotype has been done to death, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop me liking it a lot. I can&rsquo;t put my finger on quite why, but I do. Actually, I think I can put my finger on why. Cinderella meets Pygmalion. Did I mention what a huge romantic I am?</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So there we have it. Not a comprehensive list of my favourite films by any stretch of the imagination, but certainly the first that came to mind.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">And now it&rsquo;s over.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>30 Days of Film. And it&rsquo;s only taken me 4 months. Possibly closer to five. It&rsquo;s been really good fun, actually. Analysing my picks, and getting to tell you all about things I love. And hate. Who knows, maybe next year I&rsquo;ll do something similar, but this time, actually finish it on time!</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>"

I can't pick.&nbsp; I love them all, really I do, and I'm not sure I&nbsp;could pick. So, I'm going to cheat. And talk about them all.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/"">Shaun of the Dead (2004)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cw9xc/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cw9xc/s320x240"" style=""width: 191px; height: 143px;"" alt="""" /></a><br />I'm trying to remember if I'd seen Spaced before this came out... I think not, as I was just 15 when it did. So this was my first introduction to the genius of Edgar Wright. It's just so undeniably British. So wonderfully home grown. How can I not love it?<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/"">Hot Fuzz (2007)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cx117/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cx117/s320x240"" style=""width: 110px; height: 163px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />I find the characters slightly more likeable than in Shaun, and more shit blows up. But I still can't pick it above SOTD. Genius. Just genius in a slightly different way. It's less.... initmate. The whole scope of this film is bigger.  <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/"">Scot Pilgrim Vs The World (2010)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cyb0a/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cyb0a/s320x240"" style=""width: 114px; height: 169px;"" alt="""" /></a><br />Not one of the Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy, on the other hand, fantastic. I can kind of see what Simon Pegg means when he says it's the closest thing to a third series of Spaced that we're going to get. <br /><br />I know I've been rather terse talking about these films, but, well, I hardly need to explain the plots to anyone. And I think the reasons why I like them are obvious. They are funny, intelligent, well written, nicely paced, have brilliant plots and have that inimitable Edgar Wright style that is unforgettable. Genius and 5 star through and through. And you can't make me play favourites!"

"event","So, yeah, watching Die Hard last night made me feel better. As did eating chocolate and talking to my mum. And if I'm honest probably the latter. However, I also fell dead asleep whilst watching in (thank goodness I've got into the habit of setting the sleep timer on my tv) So there was no post yesterday. <br />Today was uneventful. All that happened was I&nbsp;got soaked on my way home from work. Properly drenched. Wouldn't have minded so much except I was 10 minutes away from home which meant if I hadn't stopped by the station on my way home to pick up some train tickets, I'd have been home before it started. And I phoned up to grumble at the broadband people. To get anything done in this country, you have to complain till you're blue in the nose. Maybe I'll have internet by the end of next week.

And there's films I dismissed that it turned out were really good. If there were no such things as DVDs maybe I'd wish I'd seen them at the cinema. But there's very few where I've thought &quot;OMG, I *wish* I'd seen this at the time.<br />For petty, childish reasons, I wish I'd seen <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/"">Ratatouille (2007)</a>, I'm not sure I exactly have a burning desire to see it, although I have heard it's very good, but I still haven't seen it. It's just, I realised the other day that it's the only Pixar film I never saw at the cinema. And I'm not exactly sure why...<br />I guess some of the classic Bond films, and action films like <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/"">Die Hard (1988)</a> would be good on the big screen, but it's not like it's not possible with a DVD and a big enough screen. The same goes for the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/"">Wizard of Oz (1939)</a>, although I would love to have seen it when it came out and was fresh and exciting.<br />Which, I guess, leads me to my pick:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/"">The Empire Strikes Back (1980)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cs2x3/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cs2x3/s320x240"" style=""width: 115px; height: 143px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />Why do I wish I'd seen this at the cinema (I refuse to say &quot;in theatres&quot;, that's where I go to see live acting)? I'd have thought it would be obvious. I'd loved to have seen the plot twist (and do I really need to say which one?) back when it actually <em>was</em> a plot twist. When it was&nbsp; revaltion to shake the audience. Now, it's ubiquitous. People who've never seen the film knows what happens (even if they misquote it). Hell, I'm pretty sure kids know it before they even know what Star Wars <em>is</em>!!<br />And, hah, I managed to get the whole way through the post without mentioning that I meant the fact that Darth Vader is Luke's father...damn.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","I am not happy right now. In fact, a fairer thing to say would be that I am supremely pissed off right now. 
Tonight was supposed to be good. I was going to the open evening of a vocal harmony group that I was thinking of joining. I was looking forward to it; I&rsquo;ve missed singing properly a lot whilst I&rsquo;ve been at uni, and it was one of the things I promised myself I&rsquo;d take up again once I got a job. Plus I was looking forward to meeting people who aren&rsquo;t my work colleagues. Not that there is anything wrong with my work colleagues, but I would like my circle of friends to be a little wider than that. 
But no, Google Maps has other ideas. I find out where the church is that this is supposed to be taking place and get directions on Google Maps. All fine and dandy. Then I realise I need to take a detour to a cashpoint and think &ldquo;ah it&rsquo;ll just be 10 minutes out of my way&rdquo;. Except I was wrong and it&rsquo;s more like 20. So I carry on walking on my merry way, gradually getting wetter feet as my jeans soak up the water on the ground and I inadvertently step in puddles. I&rsquo;m gonna be about 20 minutes late at this stage, but what can you do. Everything is fine, until I get to my &ldquo;destination&rdquo;. The fucker&rsquo;s not there. Now last time I checked, churches didn&rsquo;t come equipped with cloaking devices. Which means that Google maps has sent me to the wrong place. Google Maps has one fucking job, tell you where places are, and it can&rsquo;t even do that properly. Fuckers. Fuck knows where I was supposed to be, and fucked if I&rsquo;m gonna wander around bits of Cambridge I don&rsquo;t know, on my own, in the dark. So I walk to the nearest bus stop and get the bus home. Which takes about half an hour. So what do I get out of my evening? Well, about an hour and a half&rsquo;s walk, wet feet and jeans, the beginning of blisters on my feet from walking in wet socks and &pound;1.85 poorer.
I think it&rsquo;s safe to say I am a rabbit of negative euphoria right now.


Yeah, yeah, so I can email them and go along next week, having found out properly where it is I&rsquo;m supposed to go, but right now I&rsquo;m too fucked off for that to make me feel any better.

I&rsquo;m going to go and watch Die Hard now. If it makes me feel any better I may write today&rsquo;s 30 Days of Film post."

"event","Ah, lazy Sundays. They are the best. Did very little today except read fic and watch DVDs. What more can a girl want?<br /><br /><br />So, <br /><br /><strong>&bull;  Day 26 - A movie that you love but everyone else hates</strong><br /><br />Well, I like a lot of movies that not many people like, or that some people I know like but others don't or that everyone I know likes, but no one else in the history of ever does. Examples include Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull (2008) (yeah there were bits of it I didn't like, but it had the atmosphere of an Indiana Jones film) and The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy (2005), which, again , has it's flaws but isn't too terrible. But I'm not too sure that I love any of them. But I think what I'll go for is<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/"">Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)</a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cra5z/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 113px; height: 169px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cra5z/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />Because it's the film I most try to convince other people to give a go. I can see why a lot of people don't like it, it is one of those sort of frat boy comedies like Knocked Up and 40 Year Old Virgin. Not only that but it has Russel Brand in it, and I know a lot of people can't stand him. <br />And yes, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but the thing about those sorts of films, and the thing that you never get from the trailer, the thing you only get from watching it is that these films have a lot of heart. Yes, they have more than their fair share of cock jokes, but they can also be quite sweet, and in fact, possibly portray healthier relationships than the ones in &quot;chick flicks&quot;. As for Russel Brand, well he is basically playing himself, I have to admit, but he does it with an amount of humour that stops hims being just an annoying prick. He must be fairly likable, or they wouldn't have given him is own sequel. I quite like Russel Brand as a stand up, at least when he puts the effort into it, and especially when he is ripping apart newspaper articles, so I'm not as predisposed to hate him in this as some, but I&nbsp;thought he did well.<br />The plot, for those of you who don't know, is about a guy who is the composer for a CSI-like TV show and is dating the star (Sarah Marshall). She then dumps him and takes up with a rock star (played by Brand). He goes to Hawaii to get away from it all, only to find he has ended up in the same hotel as her and the new boyfriend.&nbsp; Cue much awkwardness. Along the way he gets to know the receptionist at the hotel and falls for her. Then they have a fight. He goes back home, and fulfils his ambition of putting on a Vampire Puppet Musical about Dracula. She comes to see his show when invited. Now, if this was a chick flick he'd have either a) got back with Sarah Marshall or b) run away with the receptionist and it would be all hearts and flowers. But a) Sarah Marshall is a bitch only on the look out for her own fame and has been cheating on him, and b) they've known each other for a week at most, that's hardly the basis of the most stable relationship. The way the characters interact seems much more real. Both have been stuck in something of a rut, and meeting each other gives each the impetus to move on and reach for their dreams. I've always preferred stories where someone changes, not for a person, not in order to gain that person's affection / attention, but <em>because</em> of that person, because meeting that person made them want to be better, made them see what what they could acheive, for themselves, for their own good. In my mind, that's more romantic. But that might just be me.<br />My other reason's for liking this fllm include: The main guy is played by Jason Segel. He is awesome. The videos / lyrics for Russel Brand's character's songs are just&nbsp; brilliant. Funny and almost-plausible. And, of course, The Vampire Puppet Musical. It's just genius. <br /><lj-embed id=""16""/><br />I can't find a video of the full on production at the end of the film so instead, I picked Jason Segel performing Dracula's Lament earlier in the film."

Practically every other frame is a visual gag, a reference to some other film or genre, or a terrible pun. Or there&rsquo;s something funny in the background that you&rsquo;re not noticing. And Airplane is kind of the Daddy of them all. One of the earliest of them, and it is absolutely packed with jokes. Bursting with them, you might say. Before this film, Leslie Neilson was considered a serious actor and in fact, it&rsquo;s him playing exactly the same sort of character he played in serious films with all the anarchy going on around him that really sells the film. Without him it would just be too absurd. In fact all of the main cast do a pretty stellar job of acting a serious movie amid some of the funniest scenes ever. If they tried to play up the comedy it would just descend into madness.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">The plot is entirely absurd. Both the pilot and the co-pilot of a flight get food poisoning, so to bring them all in to safety, they have to rely on a guy who flew fighters in the War, has basically got PTSD and hasn&rsquo;t flown since. And is only on the flight to convince his girlfriend, an air stewardess, not to leave him. The thing that makes this better? The writers actually bought the rights to an existing 50s B movie and used the plot from that. And then built the jokes around it.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">It would take for ever to explain just what&rsquo;s funny about this film but let me see if I can&rsquo;t pick me some highlights&hellip; the Crash Position, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t call me Shirley&rdquo;, &ldquo;I picked the wrong day to quit blank&rdquo;, the hysterical woman, the old lady who can speak Jive. And that&rsquo;s off the top of my head, having not watched in in months. I&rsquo;m not sure a minute, nay 30 seconds of this film goes by without a gag of one form or another.</p></meta></meta></meta></meta>"

"event","Well I missed posting yesterday because a couple of drinks after work for a guy's leaving do ended up with about six of us staying in the pub until closing. Since I'd been at the pub since about 20 past 5, I was rather un-sober by the time I got home. A great evening, getting to know my colleagues a bit more. Tequila happened and I demonstrated just how shit I am at pool. And this evening I went to see Scott Pilgrim again with the other new guy and the guy who's leaving. And it really sucks that they're the two people I've got on with best this week, and one of them isn't just leaving the company, he's emigrating to Australia. I think we could have been good friends. TBF, I'm just kind of surprised that he took the time and effort to talk to me and get to know me, I'm not sure many people would bother with someone who started in their last week.<br />So yeah, so was ever so more than slightly hung over this morning. Luckily, Friday is traditionally pub lunch day, where everyone goes to the pub and ends up taking at least 1 1/2 hours break. Plus I spent most of the day playing 20 questions over IRC.<br />But hey, I'm starting on actual work soon, and I had a meeting yesterday that, whilst it lasted all day a) got me another free lunch (also down the pub) and b) was actually quite interesting because it served as a really good introduction to the part of the project that I'll be working on.<br /><br />If I haven't said it before, I think I&nbsp;like this place. <br /><br />Oh yeah, and I should add to my list of mentals in my office. The guy who sits diagonally opposite me used to do cage fighting.<br /><br />All in all, it's been a pretty good first week, and from starting the week being terrified of having responsibility, I'm now kind of looking forward to doing some real work.<br /><br />And as I missed yesterday, a double dose of memeness.<br /><br /><meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8""><meta name=""ProgId"" content=""Word.Document""><meta name=""Generator"" content=""Microsoft Word 11""><meta name=""Originator"" content=""Microsoft Word 11""><link rel=""File-List"" href=""file:///C:\Users\Michelle\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtml1\01\clip_filelist.xml"" /><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

They would make fantastic family films in the vein of the Narnia series. But I guess that the books aren't well known enough and maybe a little too British to really make it to a wider audience. And considering the utter hatchet job they made of The Dark Is Rising (the second book in the series for a start, and these stories really need to be told in order) maybe they should just stary away. I love these books too much to see them butchered.<br />So I think<br /><br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables_%28musical%29"">A film of the musical of the book of Les Miserables.</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ch0a7/""><img width=""320"" height=""212"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ch0a7/s320x240"" /></a><br />(John Owen-Jones as Jean Valjean. Because.)<br /><br />It's a great show. It's in it's 25th year currently, and still playing to packed houses. Hell, it's popular enough to withstand <em>two concurrent West End productions</em>.(The original and the 25th Anniversary Tour which is finishing it's run in, I believe, the Barbican)<br />Yes, the show is long, and no, I'm not sure there is all that much you could cut, but I would gladly sit through a film that long. They would have to be careful not to stunt cast too much and make sure they cast people who can actually sing and act, but I think they could do it. I'm not going to dream cast it here, because we'd be here all night and I would be casting people most of you will never have hear of or care about.<br />The show is just so spectacular, so moving, so brilliant that I think it would work. Sure, it would make everyone cry, but (judging by my reaction) they'd just want to march back in and see it again. There have been <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&amp;q=les+miserables"">numerous attempts</a> to adapt Victor Hugo's classic novel (and yes, before you ask, I have read the unabridged novel. More than once. And I&nbsp;think it's fantastic) with varying degrees of success. I think though, that the musical is the closest you can come the feeling of the 1200 page book. The music can convey more of the emotion and sentiment that gets lost in the necessary editing than mere words could do. <br />So anyway. That's my pick. A film of Les Miserables. With singing.</p>  </meta></meta></meta></meta></meta></meta></meta></meta>"

"event","Today was... boring work wise, but good in the area of getting to know my colleagues better. There is a guy a bit further up from me, who has Bernard Black hair. It's quite long and the fringe is gelled up,&nbsp; as far as I can tell, by him putting gel in it and running his hand through it. Consequently his hair sticks up at all kinds of odd (and occasionally improbable) angles. It was quite distracting when I was talking to him earlier. <br />The office has several irc channels, and I've been sitting on them the last few days, getting a feel for what was going on, but I stated to get involved in some of the conversations today, so it's nice to feel I'm getting on with people and getting to know them a bit. There's a non-work-related channel that has some brilliantly odd conversations<br />A guy who is leaving at the end of this week specifically came over to invite me to his leaving drinks tomorrow night, which I thought was cool considering he's, you know, <em>leaving</em> so won't ever actually get to know me.<br />Going to see Scott Pilgrim again on Friday with a couple of guys from work.<br />Oh, and I got invited to the semi-regular Whisky Night (well, Rum Night this time) where people gather, have a meal and test out some whisky (or rum). Kind of feel like I've been let into the club a bit. Best thing is, what happens when you get a room full of not only geeks, but engineers to organise something important like alcohol tasting? Shit gets <em>organised</em>. It has it's own wiki page. Set out like a project&nbsp; / minutes page. Each night has it's own section which lists who was there, the whisky they drank, and what everyone thought of it. Each night also has a &quot;lessons learnt&quot; section that includes such gems as &quot;cats are xxx's kryptonite&quot; and &quot;you can make fizzy bovril with a soda stream&quot; (There are occasionally sensible things like where was good for a meal etc)<br />I am starting to really like the guys in this office.<br />Also, I went swimming after work today. I'd forgotten a) how much I like swimming b)how hungry I get after swimming and c)how good swimming makes me feel. I think I actually had more energy when I left the pool than when I got in. Gonna make it a weekly occurrence.<br /><br />So, memewards.<br /><br />&bull;  Day 22 - Favourite documentary<br /><br />I don't think I've ever actually watched a documentary film, not one that's had a cinema release. I don't really watch documentaries all that much. <br />I think, if it's not cheating too much (what with it being made for TV and in two parts) I pick<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808482/"">Stephen Fry: The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive (2006)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cf4pe/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 234px; height: 128px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cf4pe/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />A charming, touching documentary showing various people coping with their illness and telling their stories. Obviously, it is a subject very dear to Stephen's heart, and he is very candid about his own experiences, including filming some of his mood cycles. This makes his interviews all the more interesting as he knows what questions to ask to get the heart of how it affects people. The mix of celebrities and &quot;real&quot; people is a good balance as well. I teared up more than once watching it. I also found the more &quot;technical&quot; bits interesting such as the various treatments on offer and the&nbsp; research being done at the moment. Heartfelt and informative.<br />"

Was a good day though. Didn&rsquo;t do any actual work, just getting up to speed on the systems and getting to know people. Lots of stuff to read and take in. There was another new starter (although technically he&rsquo;s not really that new as he started a month ago) and I had actually met him before at my assessment centre for the job so that was cool. We got on really well, and accidentally took a 30 minute tea break today cos we got chatting. And then we spent the afternoon messaging each other in irc. He also may be pretty. That&rsquo;s not me being coy, that&rsquo;s me not having objectivity here. He could be pretty or it could be what I like to call Best Of A Bad Bunch Syndrome, where by being the most attractive person in a group of not particularly attractive people your objective attractiveness gets overestimated. Regardless, I forsee there could be trouble in the future with me developing crush. Ah well.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I got a free lunch today. I have a &ldquo;buddy&rdquo;, someone who had been working there a while and knows the ropes and who&rsquo;s job it is to be a point of contact for stuff and make sure I&rsquo;m settling in and everything. Well anyway, my buddy&rsquo;s team overreached their targets last month and so their manager was taking them all out for lunch and I got invited too. And a very nice pub lunch too. One of the things I have been worrying about is finding friends and getting on with everyone, especially because most people are a fair bit older than me. Forgetting, of course, that these are people who have decided to do computers for a living, and thus are probably rather big geeks themselves. So non-work related lunch talk mainly centred on films, with topics such as what films should be in the top 250 on imdb, what films should be in the bottom 100 on imdb, how confusing Donnie Darko was, why aren&rsquo;t the Star Wars films in the top 5, how crap Transformers is, whether Lord of the Rings is any good or if it&rsquo;s just because it&rsquo;s the only film made of the book, and how much Die Hard, Inception and Scott Pilgrim rock. Other conversational topics included how to get rid of bats, finding people in a swimming pool without your glasses and whether comparethemeerkat.com gets more traffic than comparethemarket.com. I think I&rsquo;m gonna fit right in.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">There is a fortnightly meeting of the development team in the afternoon and I sat in on that as well.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">There are some characters in my office. I can tell already. The team leader sounds like a more camp Edgar Wright. There is a man with a Great Big Bushy Beard. There is a guy I can see from my desk who had taken his shoes off all day. Perfectly reasonable behaviour until I realised he&rsquo;s gone to the meeting in his socks. This required going downstairs. And there was a guy I went to lunch with who was wearing an odd sort of boonie hat.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">They seem like a nice bunch, quite friendly and relaxed and that. Can&rsquo;t remember anyone&rsquo;s name, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll get the hang.</p></lj-cut><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Anyway, enough about me, moving on to:</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><b style=""""><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">&middot;</span><span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Day 20 - Favourite movie from your favourite actor/actress<o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">This one is fairly easy because there was only one pick for absolute favourite. There are a lot of actors and actresses I really like, ones who will draw me to see something if they are in it, because they are really talented, because they&rsquo;re generally in really good things, because I like their personality and yes, because they are prettyful. But really, there is only one person who completely encompasses all of these things (with Robert Downey Junior and James Spader coming a close joint second) and I think it&rsquo;s fairly obvious that that person is David Tennant. And once I&rsquo;d decided that it was a no brainer which film I would pick.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325123/"">Bright Young Things (2002)</a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p><br /></o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cd45r/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 210px; height: 157px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cd45r/s320x240"" /></a></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I love this film. Pure and simple. The 20s and 30s is my favourite period in history for all the global, political, financial and social upheaval that was going on, for the depression and the political extremes that rose out of trying to cope with it. With prohibition and gangsters in America and<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>the rise of jazz both there and here. With a world licking its wounds from the First World War and driving inexorably to the Second. And the beginning of the breakdown of the class structure in Britain (not saying that it&rsquo;s gone, far from it, but the rigidity started to break down here)</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">And this film captures it so brilliantly. Especially it captures the new Bright Young Things with their jazz and liquor and drugs and sex and frivolous spending clashing with the austere old guard of the Edwardian aristocracy.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">It&rsquo;s based on a book which I adore; Vile Bodies by Evelyn Waugh (unintentional poetry there)</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">The book is brilliant and the film really brings it alive, the odd rhythm of the speech and conversations, the characters, everything.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">The screenplay is written and the film is directed by Stephen Fry and a fantastic job he makes of it too.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">The cast is brilliant. Only Mr Fry could make a film with a main cast of (then) relative unknowns and then have some *huge* stars in minor supporting roles. Of course some the main cast have gone on to do very well indeed, you may have heard of them. Let&rsquo;s see, there is Fenella Woolgar, Michael Sheen, of course David Tennant and another wee Scottish actor, he&rsquo;s been in a few things, James McAvoy I think he&rsquo;s called? /sarcasm.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Incidentally there are are three Scottish actors in this film and all of them have pitch perfect upper class English accents. In fact, James McAcoy&rsquo;s accent is so good that the editor asked why he kept putting on that silly Scottish accent between takes.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">And the supporting cast? Well let&rsquo;s see, there is a brief cameo by Mark Gatiss. Also appearing are Stockard Channing, Imelda Satunton, Dan Ackroyd, Jim Broadbent, Richard E. Grant, Simon Callow, Peter O&rsquo;Toole and&nbsp; Sir John Mills in on of his last film roles before he died.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">A cast, I think you&rsquo;ll agree, to which the descriptor &ldquo;stellar&rdquo; may be appropriately applied.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I just love it. It has so many things that I like all in one place. It are genius. Fact.</p></meta></meta></meta></meta>"

<![endif]-->  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I currently have no internet, but thought I&rsquo;d write this cos I know you are all breathless with anticipation to find out what I&rsquo;m doing these first few days in Cambridge. I will post this when I get connected to the internet. (Actually it&rsquo;s mostly to give me something to do in the evenings)</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut because I do go on...""><p class=""MsoNormal""><b style="""">Sunday<o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So I moved in today. Got the last of my stuff in&hellip; I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what I&rsquo;m going to do with everything. My flat is not so good on the whole storage thing, and I have rather a lot of stuff. My, my dad and my brother built my desk. It&rsquo;s pretty awesome. My step mum sorted out my kitchen, cleaning and putting things in places and stuff. Oh and we built a pan stand (exciting). I unpacked a few things. In the evening we went to Frankie and Benny&rsquo;s for dinner, and it seems to me that Cambridge is the place to come for excellent service. My brother ordered ribs that were *swimming* in barbeque sauce, which he found a little too spicy. He scraped most of it off, but still had difficulties. All my step mum did was say to the waitress &ldquo;could you get him a glass of water, because he&rsquo;s finding it a little spicy.&rdquo; The waitress immediately went off and came back with a glass of water, a glass of pepsi, and then took my brother&rsquo;s plate away and said she&rsquo;d get him some more with less sauce, because he wasn&rsquo;t going to enjoy it. And so a little later he got back some ribs with the barbeque sauce in a jug so he could pour on as much as he liked.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Normally you have to complain till you&rsquo;re blue in the face to get that kind of thing.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Oh yeah, and asked me how old I was when I ordered alcohol and when I said I was 21 she gave the *best* reaction ever. I don&rsquo;t think I can give it full justice. Dad walked me home and that was my day.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><b style="""">Monday<o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Slept like the dead last night. Good because I worried I&rsquo;d sleep badly, first night and all. I guess getting four hours sleep on Saturday wasn&rsquo;t quite so stupid. This morning we went to Tesco, and I rather took advantage of the fact that my parents were paying. To be fair, first shops are always expensive cos you need to get *everything* and I also needed to get cleaning stuff which isn&rsquo;t cheap. And some flat bits.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">After putting it away, we spent the afternoon in the city centre; wandering around shops, having lunch in a tea shop, watching people punt on the river, having afternoon tea in another tea shop and just generally doing touristy stuff. They went home and I lay in bed and watched Studio 60 for a couple of hours. I unpacked a few more things, and now just have piles of things I need to find homes for. Gonna unpack a bit more in a minute and then go and make a sandwich.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><b style="""">Tuesday<o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Well I seem to have the sleeping thing down pat which is nice. Haven&rsquo;t left the flat at all today as I have been unpacking and rearranging my books and dvds all day. Because yes, I do need to have them in some semblance of an order and yes, I do keep an inventory of all my stuff and I had to add a bunch of things to it. But hey. I did spend about 4 hours sorting books today, which was possibly a little nuts, but once I&rsquo;d pulled them all off of the shelves what else was I supposed to do with them?</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I watched about two discs of Studio 60 and revelled in its awesome. I discovered I have nearly 70 CDs, 190 DVDs and 320 books. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how all that happened, but I am glad to books outweigh the DVDs.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I cooked my first meal in my flat which was a pretty scrummy stir fry, but since it was nearly midnight by the time I sat down to eat (those damn books) I think rat stew would have tasted nice.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">The really pissing annoying thing about the day was that I found out that I can&rsquo;t sign up for internet until my phone line gets activated on Monday, and from that point it will take about 10 days. I&rsquo;m feeling pretty cut off now, especially as my mum and step dad are in Spain until Friday. At least I have my phone, although it is rather an exercise in frustration trying to do anything meaningful with it. And just to add insult to injury, Peep, the HTC twitter client is down, so I&rsquo;m having to use the website.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I love my Dad, and he&rsquo;s been great, recognising that I was a little bit overwhelmed and doing the Dad thing and getting things started and basically giving me the swift kick up the backside that I needed to start thinking again. He also saw how I was feeling a little lost at the prospect of them leaving, so has called me the last two nights to see how I was. The only thing is he is The Practical One, so when I was bemoaning my internet woes, he was all, well at least next time you know to be a bit quicker off the ball with sorting these things out. I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking, &ldquo;Well duh, but that doesn&rsquo;t help me now.&rdquo; When I said I was blaming BT for taking a week to flick some switches (seriously, they don&rsquo;t even need to install a phone line, it&rsquo;s already here) he said it wasn&rsquo;t really their fault to which my response was &ldquo;it makes me feel better&rdquo; and he said it wouldn&rsquo;t make him feel better because he couldn&rsquo;t change it in the future, whilst my way of thinking was that if I said it&rsquo;s all my fault, I would be spending the entire time sitting here thinking &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t I sort this sooner. I should have sorted this sooner&rdquo; when the fact is I couldn&rsquo;t sort it until I was physically in the flat and knew my number, and that noone, of all the many people I know who have done all of this before, and especially those who were in the flat with me thought to say &ldquo;it takes a while to set these kinds of things up maybe you should get onto that&rdquo; since, obviously I should know these things by osmosis. I&rsquo;m wandering <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>from the point a little. What I mean is, the past is past, the fact that I should have sorted it earlier doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that I <i style="""">didn&rsquo;t.</i> And whilst I&rsquo;m sure we all learnt a valuable lesson for the future, the future isn&rsquo;t here yet, so in the here and now it makes me feel better to blame BT for being ridiculous. Also, the lesson I&rsquo;m taking away from this is &ldquo;next time you move, sort stuff out sooner because BT are dicks who take a whole week to turn some stuff on.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">My brother has also been lovely, I think he worries about me which is really sweet, he rang me this afternoon, admittedly mostly to tell me he&rsquo;d just bought a unicycle, but his first question was to ask me if I was ok. Not just the usual &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo; which, as my step dad always says, is a greeting, not a question, but &ldquo;are you ok?&rdquo; which implies you actually care about the answer.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><b style="""">Wednesday<o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Ok, so I admit the sleeping thing is probably more to do with going until I reach the point of exhaustion, but the point is I get an unbroken night&rsquo;s sleep. I worked out this morning that my kitchen faces east cos I could see the sun rising when I went to get a glass of water early. Which means my living room window faces south, a fact I should have realised before because it gets the sun most of the day. So that&rsquo;s nice. I left the house today, to go and give blood, but they couldn&rsquo;t find a vein so I couldn&rsquo;t. But the people were singularly lovely. So that&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;m just about to go to an internet caf&eacute; up the road called &ldquo;web and eat&rdquo; (I like this name, it&rsquo;s very&hellip; Ronseal, it does exactly what it says on the tin), because trying to reply to email on my phone is annoying and I need to send an important one to my boss. After that I may go on an exploratory walk, or I may go to the cinema, or I may just come home and play video games. Part of me is not looking forward to starting work because I&rsquo;ll have to give up all this free time, whilst the other part of me just wants to see people at this stage. Maybe I&rsquo;ll convince my mum to come up next weekend instead of the weekend after. Now I need to go and make a list of all the things I need to do at the internet caf&eacute;.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&hellip;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Internet caf&eacute;d out. Went for a little wander on my way back. The more I see the more I fall in love with this city. It&rsquo;s just so&hellip; picturesque. So many amazing buildings. My road is just a road full of quirk. The houses have so much character. All different ages and styles. And some are fucking *huge*!</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Cooking dinner now. Sausage and mash. Om nom nom</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><b style="""">Thursday<o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Today I went exploring in town.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I found Forbidden Planet, which is *tiny*. The whole shop is probably smaller than the downstairs of the Cardiff one. It does appear to be the only comic book shop in town, which sucks a little. Or at least it&rsquo;s the only one I&rsquo;ve found. I joined the local library which is good for two reasons: 1) it&rsquo;s a library and 2) members get free wi fi access.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I also found out about various clubs and singing groups and stuff, so I&rsquo;m going to see which ones I want to join.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">The history of this town is amazing, you can&rsquo;t throw a stone without hitting something that is over 100 years old. There is a sculpture thing celebrating the city&rsquo;s octocentenary. 800 years, its unimaginable.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I also found a fudge shop that sells fudge that is <i style="""">to die for</i>. Gorgeous. And pretty expensive. I&rsquo;m going to get some when I get paid. Nommy.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Feeling a little lonely though. Just need to find people. Once I start work and join some clubs hopefully that will get better. And hope my mum can come and visit this weekend.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">My feet are killing me now though. And I need to wash up before I eat. And I&rsquo;m hungry. Ugh.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Oh yeah, and I started watching Sports Night. It&rsquo;s really weird to see Aaron Sorkin writing half hour comedy. His style is so much better suited to 1 hour drama. Or drama with a large pinch of comedy. And the laugh track is weird. That being said, I really like it. I have no interest in sports but I really like the characters. And there is still Aaron Sorkin&rsquo;s genius.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>One of the things I really love about it is that it only takes place in the studio and offices of the show. It brings a really interesting story telling style to it, because we never see anything that happens outside of the building, we are only told about it. It&rsquo;s kind of like watching play.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So, Sports Night. Awesome. My feet. Hurting. Cambridge City. Fun.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><b style="""">Friday<o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Not much of a day today. Spent the day mostly watching Sports Night. I love Dan and Casey. The second season goes out of the building but only in interior sets. And then I went for a walk. And bought chocolate pudding. And then watched more Sports Night. Now I&rsquo;m watching Tim Minchin. I think the lack of human contact is sending me slightly mad. One of the highlights of the day was discovering that my tv remote fits exactly into my slipper. And I invented the Chocolate Pudding Dance.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Still my mum, and possibly the rest of my family, is coming to visit tomorrow, so I&rsquo;ll have people to *talk* to! W00t!</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">My baby brother had his first day at secondary school and doesn&rsquo;t that make me feel old. I was worried for him because he was really worried, but he seems to have had a great time.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Also, I feel I should mention that I managed, err&hellip; three days before I caved and started reading fic on my phone. Maybe it would have been longer if I hadn&rsquo;t started watching Sports Night. Still, thank god I get the internet on my phone. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d survive if I didn&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t really explain how much I can&rsquo;t wait till I can get broadband set up in the flat. Really.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><b style="""">Saturday<o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">My mum, step dad and sisters came up to visit today. It was wonderful. Seriously, I just can&rsquo;t explain how great it was to see them all again. I always thought I did fine with my own company, but it turns out that I do only when I can also see people whenever I want. 4 days without people to speak to face to face near sent me crazy. There were a couple of minor incidents; my mother really isn&rsquo;t very good at map reading and has a slightly rubbish sense of direction, my step dad doesn&rsquo;t know the area and was driving and neither of them were listening to me when I a) can read maps pretty well and have a good sense of direction, and b) know the area a little better and so could have directed them towards where they wanted to go a little easier. Also, I get the feeling my step dad doesn&rsquo;t like the flat. Actually it&rsquo;s more that a feeling, he said something about it that I can&rsquo;t quite remember, and when I asked him what he didn&rsquo;t like he wouldn&rsquo;t say and got all pissy at me. I was trying to ask light heartedly, just to see his opinion, because, you know, I do genuinely care about the opinion of a man who has been a major part of my life since I was four years old. I don&rsquo;t have two parents, I have four, and I want them all to be happy for me. It may have come out slightly defensively, but I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way, and like I said, I care about is opinion, so if he doesn&rsquo;t like my choices then I feel like he is disparaging my judgement. He already decided he didn&rsquo;t like Cambridge much, that it was full of Hooray Henrys. Well, it&rsquo;s Cambridge, what do you expect? I won&rsquo;t deny that it&rsquo;s a posh city, hell it has bespoke tailors on what feels like every street corner. But if that&rsquo;s all you take away from it, I can&rsquo;t help but feel you&rsquo;re missing the point. I just adore the history of the place, it seeps from every pore of every building, you can feel it in the air. Ok, so that&rsquo;s rather pretentiously poetic, but it just irked me. And now that he won&rsquo;t say why he doesn&rsquo;t like it, I&rsquo;m left wondering, is it just because it&rsquo;s kind of cluttered because it&rsquo;s full of my stuff? Is it because he doesn&rsquo;t like the area? The building? The flat itself? He doesn&rsquo;t like that I&rsquo;ve moved away? Is it because he&rsquo;s looking at it through the eyes of someone in their forties with a mortgage and three kids (hmm and isn&rsquo;t it telling I nearly wrote two), instead of through the eyes of someone in their 20s with their first real place? Is it because he thinks I&rsquo;m being ripped off? Does he not like the fact that he wasn&rsquo;t really involved in the decision making process? Is he still annoyed with me for not wanting to do everything his way when I moved in? I just don&rsquo;t know, and it takes the wind out of my sails a little bit to think that the one of the most important people in my life doesn&rsquo;t approve.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Woah. Apparently that was niggling at me more that I thought. I guess I&rsquo;ll just have to ask him again and explain why it&rsquo;s important to me.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">All of that aside, I am so glad they came. Just so happy to see them. I didn&rsquo;t miss them this much when I was at university.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Sunday</strong></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Why didn&rsquo;t I think of this before? Seriously, and I didn&rsquo;t even think of it. Couldn&rsquo;t use my phone as a 3G tether for my laptop because the network had locked down those settings. Wasn&rsquo;t until I was talking to a friend last night and they pointed out that there was probably an app to work around it. So today I spent an hour or so sorting it out so now I can access the internet on my laptop. And just in time to give updates on my first week at work in glorious technicolour.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Today was a boring day. I had a mini fry up (egg, sausage, fried bread) and fell asleep for about an hour afterwards. I started watching NCIS Los Angeles and I&rsquo;m starting to get hooked. It&rsquo;s certainly getting better, and Hetty is awesome. And they got rid of the Irritating Blonde Woman from the pilot (they even kill her off in a later episode of NCIS) so I quite like all of the characters now. Though Eric will never be as awesome as Abby.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I sorted out the internet (yay) and ironed all my clothes for this week.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I am absolutely *bricking* it for tomorrow. This is it, I&rsquo;m about to start work for reals. With a big girls job. And I don&rsquo;t get to stop for another 50 years. Its abso-bloody-fucking-lutely *terrifying* I just hope this first week I get to ease in gently.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p></lj-cut><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">TL,DR: I moved, I did stuff, I whined, I worked out how to get internet on my laptop via my phone.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Expect a<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>full update on my first day tomorrow.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">And now, without further ado:</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><b style=""""><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">&middot;</span><span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Day 19 - Favourite movie based on a book/comic/etc<o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><b style=""""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Hoo boy. This is a tough one. Partly because my favourite comic book movies aren&rsquo;t coming out for a while&hellip; (if I saw clips from them at Comic Con, I&rsquo;m totally allowed to say that) It&rsquo;s also tough because so many films <i style="""">are</i> based on books/comics/etc. And you might not even realise. Right now, I seem to mostly be able to think of comic book movies, so, there you go. One that isn&rsquo;t is <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325123/"">Bright Young Things (2002) </a><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480255/"">The Losers (2010)</a> I&rsquo;ve already mentioned. I was *this* close to picking <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/"">Scott Pilgrim vs The World (2010)</a>, but I think I need to see it again before I can decide where it ranks.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">So I&rsquo;m deciding to go with</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/"">Iron Man (2008)</a></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ccerg/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ccerg/s320x240"" style=""width: 89px; height: 132px;"" alt="""" /></a>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Why? Well, mostly because it was the film that got me into comic book movies and thus comic books. I&rsquo;d seen a few various comic book movies in the past, but never been particularly overly impressed. But Iron Man had something special. It didn&rsquo;t try to explain too much in an origin movie, it was well cast, it had a good plot, it had a sarcastic mainframe and an adorable robot. And because of that I watched Iron Man 2 and because of that I got psyched over Thor and the Avengers movies and because of that I started reading The New Avengers and because of that I got more psyched over the movies and because of that I had a much more enjoyable Comic Con and because of that I got even more psyched about the movies and hooked on comics in general. So I pick it because I can pretty much pinpoint it as the first cause of a trend that is likely to end up with me with a framed print of Captain America on my wall in the near future. And by likely I mean I really *really* want it.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p></meta></meta></meta></meta>"

"event","After yesterday's litany of woe, today has been better. In fact, it's been pretty good. Most of the day was spent tidying the house and packing, which was pretty boring and then I broke the hoover. The plastic handle bit snapped. My uncle randomly happened to be delivering furniture to next door, and he stopped by to say good bye. Then my aunt came with a set of scales she had bought me. And then my nan invited over for dinner. And then I went to see Scott Pilgrim. Ok, I lied, today has been *very* good.<br /><br />After today I'm gonna have to put this on hiatus until I get broadband in my flat, and I don't know how long that's going to take. Whilst I do have the internet on my phone, it's not really conducive to writing long and involved posts. But as soon as I get connected to the tubes I'll carry on because it's been so much fun writing about all these films<br /><br /><strong>&bull;  Day 18 - A movie that you wish more people would&rsquo;ve seen</strong><br /><br />Hmm... toughie. I wish more people had seen <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090213/"">Tuff Turf (1985)</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325123/"">Bright Young Things (2003)</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066740/"">The Abominable Doctor Phibes (1971)</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274812/"">Secretary (2002)</a> and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373469/"">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)</a><br /><br />But my pick is:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1045772/"">I Love You Phillip Morris (2009)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ca4p3/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000ca4p3/s320x240"" style=""width: 219px; height: 131px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />Why? Well because it's an indie film that somehow managed to end up with two a-listers in the cast. Because when Jim Carrey isn't being &quot;madcap&quot; I really like him and I think he's a good actor (love The Truman Show and Liar Liar). He's rather like Robin Williams that way. Because Ewan McGegor. Because it's based on a true story. Because it's great to have a film about gay characters that isn't about the fact that they are gay. Because no one in America would touch it for distribution because of Teh Gay. And it took forever to be released over here as well.&nbsp; Seriously, it premiered at the Sundance festival in January of 2009 but wasn't released in Britain till March this year. The internet tells me it is being released in the USA in December. Hopefully.<br />It is just such a brilliant film. Sweet, funny, heartbreaking. For those of you who don't know, it's about Steven Russel (Carrey) a man who is happily married (and having secret gay sex in motels) until a car crash makes him realise he can't pretend anymore so he decides to leave his wife and go and live the life he wants. This costs a lot of money, so he becomes a con man to make up for it. He is caught and whilst in prison he meets and falls in love with Phillip Morris (McGregor). When Phillip is released, Steven repeatedly attempts to escape to be with him. Parts of it make me awwwwwwww so much. Admittedly, Jim Carrey and sex were two things my brain didn't really need linking and Ewan McGregor as a blond is odd but grew on me, although the... Georgia (I think) accent was <em>weird</em>.<br />But other than that I just kind of want to hug this film all over.<br />When I went to see it at the cinema with <lj user=""plum177""/>&nbsp;, the audience was kind of split between those people who had come to see it expecting a mad Jim Carrey film and those who actually knew what the film was about. Which led to one of the funniest overheard phrases as we walked out, which was one guy's opinion of what the film needed: &quot;more funny, less bumming.&quot;&nbsp; There was also one point (a scene with Phillip and Stephen dancing together in their cell) where a girl very loudly awwed at it. Not that I heard, I was too busy melting into a pile of mush.<br />So, yeah, it's just a sweet little film that deserves a bigger audience.<br /><br />Incidentally, whilst I was looking for the above picture I found this:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cb71f/""><img width=""320"" height=""213"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000cb71f/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />Which threw me for a loop a little because I found myself thinking &quot;Jim Carrey looks hot in that picture&quot; which is not a thought I'm used to having. Is it just me? Also Ewan's hair is FLOOOOOOOFY!!!!<br />"

"event","Today has been... not a good day. <br /><lj-cut text=""Cut for emo and boring"">I started out the day trying to get broadband sorted for my flat. So it's written into my contract that I can't change the telephone number of the flat without written permission from the landlord. Which is fair enough, just need to check the &quot;keep my old number box&quot;. Except to do that you need to know your old number. Which I don't. So I can either find this out when I get to my flat with a phone or ring the letting agents to see if they know. As the point of the exercise was to get all of this sorted before I moved, so I could organise any installations during the week before I start work I go with option B. Except the guy who manages my flat isn't in. And, obviously, this is specialised knowledge only he would know and it couldn't possibly be replicated, I don't know, in a file or something. So the girl says he'll call me back when he gets in. Which is, of course, estate agent code for &quot;I probably won't even tell him about this call and even if I do he ain't ringing you back.&quot; But obviously, I wait all day to see if he will cos I don't wanna phone again and seem all nagging fish wife. Yeah, yeah, I know.<br />Anyway, during the course of this I look back over the stuff for the setting up of the internet, and it tells me that if I want to keep my own number, it will take 5 -7 <em>weeks</em> to sort out. <em>Weeks.</em> Fucking WEEKS. They expect me to be without internet for nearly two months! What the fucking fuck?&nbsp;<br />Anyway, all of this rather severely pissed me off, and I couldn't really complain to my mum and solicit advice, because she, my stepdad and my sisters are currently visiting my stepdad's parents in Spain. My dad is less use in situations like this because he always wants to be <em>practical</em> and offers advice when all I want to do is bitch and moan, and then when I <em>do </em> want advice, he's all &quot;well it's up to you, what do you think you should do?&quot;<br />It was at this point that my brain decided to fully comprehend the fact that I was moving out of my parents' house <em>forever</em>, moving to a city where I knew absolutely no one, would be working in an almost entirely male office, all of whom are at least five years older than me, and I'd be living completely on my own for the first time and, oh yeah, my mum wouldn't be here when I left and wouldn't be back in the country for another week. Cue me crying wretchedly for half an hour. And, you know what, sobbing in a house alone? <em>Really</em> not fun. And the worst bit of it was that I couldn't even phone my mum to tell her this because there was no way I was going to ruin her holiday by telling her that what I really wanted was for her to get on the next plane home so that she could come and give me a hug. <br />So this mood pretty much put paid to me doing anything productive today. Instead, I spent a couple of hours on <a href=""http://www.regretsy.com"">regretsy</a>, and looking at the weird shit made me feel better enough that I didn't feel the need to cry down the phone at my dad when he finished work at 12.30 as I had originally planned. Then I went to Tesco to buy doritos (there was much left over dip from the party last night) and Ben and Jerries. I came back to discover all the bread had gone mouldy in the last couple of days, so I had to throw away about 3/4s of a loaf. Then I discovered that someone had left a mug and a bowl in the dishwasher and not told me and the bowl was starting to grow things. After lunch I finally managed to enthuse myself with enough energy to walk into town to get a birthday present for my friend who I was going to see this evening. I really wasn't in the mood for doing anything other than hiding from the world under my duvet, let alone shopping so this took some doing. I rather stupidly decided not to take my mp3 player, and thus had nothing to distract myself from my thoughts as I walked, which were not exactly in my happy place at that point. Leading to me nearly bursting into tears in the middle of town on at least three separate occasions and starting crying on the way home. So I bought a phone for my house and the required birthday present, cheering up a little at Hawkins Bazaar. Then I walked through town feeling vaguely restless. I guess I was feeling slightly destructive, but even at my most upset and pissed off I generally remain rational enough to not do any lasting damage, so this transmuted itself to wanting to do something really stupid and spend loads of money on something I didn't need. Like a PS3. Which is a good idea when you have to wait a month before you get paid, have to pay rent and bills before then and owe your parents lots of money. So at this point I was walking past schuh and decided it was a better idea to go in. Where I ended up buying some Converse. Which is better than a PS3 I guess. They are really nice, double tongued black and royal/electric blue type colour, but it's not like I'd had my eye on them for a while, they were a complete impulse purchase. They are here:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.converse.com/#/products/Shoes/ChuckTaylor/117256F"">www.converse.com/#/products/Shoes/ChuckTaylor/117256F</a> and according to the website are men's shoes but were in the ladies section of the shop, and frankly, Converse are pretty bloody unisex anyway. And I let myself be talked into buying a tote bag as well. And then I went into HMV and ended up buying Studio 60 on DVD. Which, at least, I had had my eye on for ages and was reduced to &pound;7 in the sale.<br />I got home, really, <em>really</em> not in the mood to go back out and be sociable and just wanting to hide under my duvet even more. Cue more regretsy. But I had bought my friend a present and thus I needed to give it to her. I went to wrap the present and realised I had forgotten to get paper. It was too late to get any so I scoured the house for some. And ended up with Christmas paper. Really crap Christmas paper. <br />Oh yeah, and just to add insult to injury, the parka I really want, the replica of the Quadrophenia parka that I have wanted for nearly two years now and had promised myself I would buy this winter as I had a job, it's been discontinued. They don't make them anymore.<br />This story has a happy ending though, because once I'd actually got to my friend's house, it turned out that what I really needed was a few hours laughing and joking and not thinking about the future. And cake. And then when I got home,&nbsp; I got a phone call from a friend who had seen my tweets from earlier in the day and wanted to makes sure I was ok. We hadn't spoken to each other since graduation, and then only briefly, so we ended up chatting for nearly an hour until my phone battery died, catching up and comparing flats. Which completed the evenings cheering up, so much so that even recounting the day's events has not uncheered me.</lj-cut><br /><br />I feel today's topic fits in rather well with the overall mood of today, so without further ado I give you:<br /><br /><strong>&bull;  Day 17 - A movie that disappointed you the most</strong><br /><br /><br />A few to choose from in this category, I guess. The Music of Chance was disappointing because it didn't end. We watched <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102685/"">Point Break (1991)</a> as part of the Hot Fuzz double bill (ie, with Bad Boys II) and that was disappointing. The only two good bits are the foot chase (which is pretty damn special) and the bit where he fires his gun in the air and says &quot;ahhh&quot;. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311429/"">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003)</a> is really disappointing, Sean Connery being the only thing that makes that film watchable.<br /><br />But my number one pick is:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084434/"">An Officer and a Gentleman (1982)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000c8c0y/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000c8c0y/s320x240"" style=""width: 112px; height: 170px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />So why so disappointing? The ending. And the hype. And the hype about the ending. It's one of those films you hear of as being one of the most romantic films ever. And the final scene has to be one of the most parodied scenes ever.<br /><br /><br /> <lj-cut text=""Here be spoilers"">It's the story of a group of cadets going through Naval Flight school to become Naval Aviators and their various relationships with the local women, focussing particularly on Richard Gere's character. He has a relationship with a girl, at the end of his training they break up, then he changes his mind and comes, in full Naval Dress Whites to the factory where she works with all the other girls and literally sweeps her off her feet and carries her out of there. Strings swell and the audience leaves the cinema wiping a tear from their eye. Romantic music, naval uniforms, Richard Gere back when he was pretty, what more could I want?<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000c9xwh/""><img width=""235"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000c9xwh/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />Except, I found myself thinking, hang on a minute, all she needed was a man to come and sweep her off her feet and take her away from this life of drudgery? Really?<br />And it doesn't feel like it fits with the film. It really feels tacked on, like the film originally ended with them breaking up and then they showed it to a test audience who said &quot;make film have happy ending. me not like sad.&quot; and so they hastily shot this scene and threw it haphazardly at the end of the film.<br />And the worst part of it is, it could be a really good film. Right up until that point, up until the last five minutes of the film I was really enjoying it. It was a nice little drama, a character study of how a group of people are thrown together and bond with the cadets becoming friends over their tough training and the fact that they all start dating the local girls who are all friends (and who also serially date each new batch of recruits when they come in). It was about the different ways to fall in love and the different ways to cope. About how sometimes the person you need walks into your life at just the right time. The fact that the main couple broke up at the end was the perfect bittersweet ending. They didn't break up because of some massive fight, or misunderstanding, they just had both got all they needed from the relationship and it was time to move on. <br />And then they give it the big Hollywood production and they all live happily ever after the end. And I can't help thinking they'd both have been better off if they'd stayed apart.<br /></lj-cut><br />So there we go, An Officer And A Gentleman is my most disappointing film because an absolutely lovely film is spoiled by a happy ending. And it's not often I say that.<br />"

"event","This is my second slightly tipsy 30 days of film post. Just had a bunch of people over as a sort of leaving party get together thing. It was a brilliant night. Alas, my week got so busy I had to have it on Thursday, and most people had to work so it wasn't a long night. But fun. Also, I am now *possibly*, kind of, a little bit addicted to Guitar Hero. So that's another thing to add to my list of things to buy. Oops?<br /><br />On with the meme!<br /><strong><br />&bull;  Day 16 - A movie that you used to love but now hate</strong><br /><br />This one was actually quite easy as there was only really one pick and that was:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243155/"">Bridget Jones' Diary (2001)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000c7sd2/""><img border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000c7sd2/s320x240"" style=""width: 124px; height: 185px;"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />(guys, guys, guys, the Danish title is Bridget Jones' Dagbog! Awesome)<br /><br />So, why did I love this film? And how did I come to hate it? Well, funnily enough, the reason is also the subject of <a href=""http://niblick-iii.livejournal.com/28052.html"">yesterday's post</a>; Elizabeth Bennet.<br />The story goes like this:<br />One upon a time there was a Michelle. This Michelle liked Colin Firth very much, and thought that Bridget Jones' Diary was just the best film ever because it was full of Colin Firth being all brooding and silent, and then all romantic. And then Michelle found out that Bridget Jones' Diary was based on Pride and Prejudice. And that they had made an adaptation of it also starring Colin Firth and he was *even more* brooding and silent. And there was a scene with a lake. Then Michelle found that said adaptation was being repeated on BBC 3. Michelle watched the first two episodes and loved it so much she bought the DVD, despite missing the other four episodes. After watching the whole thing Michelle went into the nearest bookshop and bought the book. And then Michelle read the book and went... &quot;Hang on? So they took this independent minded, intelligent woman who didn't have the aspirations that society expected her to have and was perfectly happy with the fact that she wasn't going to find the kind of love that would induce her to marry and so would be alone and decided that the best modern analogy they could come up with was a whiny, slightly stupid woman obsessed with her looks and weight who was absolutely desperate to shack up with some man? And they thought this was a *good* thing?&quot;&nbsp;<br />And thus Michelle hated Bridget Jones' Diary (although not with the fiery passion of a thousand suns, because, you know, it <em>still has Colin Firth in it</em>.)<br />The End."

My and my brother made butterfly cakes (from a packet, I tried to convince him to make it from scratch but he didn't want to *shrugs* some people) and then spent the afternoon playing Guitar Hero. I suck. A bit. Ok a lot. Onwards to:<br /><br /><strong>&bull;  Day 15 - A character who you can relate to the most</strong><br /><br />I'm not really sure I particularly relate to anyone in films. Not many 21-year-old female computer scientist geeks around. At least not ones that don't conform to every sterotype going. So my pick is... cheating a little I guess. I mean, the character is *in* films. But a) not originally and b) the films that you'll all think of I refuse to watch because, no and I haven't seen the one made in the 40s. But I think this is the character I relate to most. That is:<br /><br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bennet"">Elizabeth Bennet (Pride and Prejudice)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000c5476/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 140px; height: 129px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000c5476"" /></a><br /><br />Ok so I'm slightly cheating there as that is a picture of Jennifer Ehle from the 1995 BBC version, but I refuse to acknowledge Ms Sticky McStickerson (otherwise known as Kiera Knightly) as Elizabeth. <br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000c6y23/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 120px; height: 151px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/niblick_iii/pic/000c6y23/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />Nothing (well not much) against her, just really don't like the film (and no I haven't seen it, but as I was active in P&amp;P fandom (and yes, they have one) at the time it came out, I know enough of the details to make me dislike it)<br />Anyway, back to the whole character I relate to thing. I know, I know, it sounds odd, out of all the characters in everything ever, I feel I can relate to a member of the minor Regency gentry? Well yes. Strip away the details of the period and look at Lizzie's essential character and what do you have? And intelligent young woman who knows her own mind, refuses to conform the society's expectations of how she should act and decides how she wants to live her life based on what she wants and will make her happy, not what everyone else thinks she should want. She also stands up for herself and her principles and won't be cowed by her &quot;betters.&quot;<br />As a 21-year-old female computer scientist geek, I can relate. Boy howdy can I relate. I've spend most of my life refusing to conform to society's expectations of how I should act and doing things that makes me happy not what people think I should want to do. And as for the second bit? That's what I hope to be. That's what I aspire to. I like to think I even achieve it from time to time.<br />So that's it really, that's why the character I can relate to most is Elizabeth Bennet."

Some people are surprised that I like action movies, and other people are surprised that I like rom coms. But I think most people kind of know that by now so I'm going to pick a different genre. Which I have previously describes as &quot;people stand around in rooms and talk about their feelings.&quot; Those kind of slow paced dramas where not all that much happens plot-wise but there is a lot of character development.<br />It's not the kind of film I like to watch often, but I do like them.

It's just a lovely, intimate little film with an amazing cast. It has Jake Gyllenhaal, Dusting Hoffman, Susan Sarandon and Holly Hunter (albeit briefly). The story is about a young man (Gyllanhaal) in the aftermath of his fianc&eacute;e's tragic death (she was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was shot). <lj-cut text=""The rest of the plot (eg spoilers) under the cut"">He is staying with his fianc&eacute;e's parents (Hoffman and Sarandon) and the three of them band together to cope with the loss and the funeral. However, as the story unravels, you discover that he and his fianc&eacute;e had broken up, and when she was killed she was on her way to tell her parents and call off the wedding. As they don't know this, he feels compelled to carry on the charade that they were deliriously happy, to go into business with her father as they had planned, in other words to be stuck with these people when all he wants to do is get away and move on. He meets a girl in the local bar and falls in love with her and struggles to find a way to tell his ex-future-in-laws the truth.</lj-cut><br />It is a really nice study of loss and grief and love and healing."

She came with 3 love holes but now has 8 total, of which are not ""love holes"".  They said she could withstand 250lbs, but didn't meet her standards at the Frost housewarming party.  We tried to bring her back from the dead with no avail.

"event","So I am sad to see one of my friends leaving me for the bleak and dreary state of Colorado.  She is leaving me behind with no one to go to Poor Paul's with and no one to entertain me as my psuedo-boyfriend while mine is away constantly with his job.  

The house is looking a bit better with the addition of a regulation horseshoe pit in the backyard and outdoor speakers.  It should be nice for the party.  So yes the Frost family is a bit odd in nature, as we like things that no one else likes.  Ie, my brother will read anything if it costs $4 or less at the bookstore including Star War novels and other such trash.  Sometimes I think he is one of those scary guys who show up at conventions with spock ears on and the formidable V hand sign.  I embrace it, we are geeks.  I type in this mindless journal and read non-fiction.  

The summer is here and I have only been to the beach a few times.  It makes me sad that I don't have the money to spend on gas for the hour trip.  I miss it.  I only have a slight tan and I haven't played beach vball for 3 months.  It's been a sad summer.  No drunken day binges on the weekends, and no lounging out at the pool.  

So I am still a jobless fucker.  The Bacardi bitch never gave me a callback and, well, fuck I guess I haven't been actively looking.  So it is all my fault yes?  That I am a lazy fucker waiting for a job to fall into my lap as always?

Illegal fireworks at my house.  I could probably open my own stand.  I might do that.  Sell illegal fireworks out of a beat up truck in the back of an alley, and wait for my first ass raping.  But hey, in all, it's a job?  Whom else will sell those illegal fireworks to the citizens of Florida??  Who is going to light that drunkard mullet haired bald fat fucker's hand on fire while trying to light a roman candle??  Who is going to put out your oversprayed hairspray spikes when you pretend that your sparkler is a glowstick???  ME!!!! I keep jobs in America by doing my small part.  I keep the jobs in the hospitals, EMTS, and the firemen.  Me, the average law-breaking citizen.   Let the ass raping commence for the freedom and prosperity of American life."

June 28 is a big party at my house.  It is a housewarming pool party/bbq for those fortunate to know my  brother and I.  If anyone knows Mr. T's address let me know it got lost in the move and we might have jello wrestling.  I don't know if I have a shower cap that will fit his afro.  

Funny how your actions come and bite you in the ass 3 fold.  How you treat someone....say your first real boyfriend, and you don't treat him that well, you don't appreciate him, you take him for granted.  You break up and grow up.  Next boyfriend you have he treats you like you treated your ex boyfriend.  It's laws of science.  You kick yourself in the ass cause now you know how awful it feels.  You try to change it the way things are going and there you are sitting by yourself on the beach wondering if things will ever get better"

The Publix near my house is like my second home.  I am there quite often buying shit I forgot the day before.  I know who makes the best subs, who the slow baggers are, who stares at my butt when I walk in, I know it all.  The nice old guy, Mac, knows that he doesn't have to ask me paper or plastic.  He knows I don't give a shit.  He likes to surprise me with paper one day plastic the next.  He flashes me a 2000 watt smile as I wheel my cart, that always grabs to the right, out and to the chevy.

My roommates and I decide to go the the ole Publix in the morning to get some odds and ends.  That is all except for the older bitchy one. Her sister was visiting.
Three girls shove into the front seat of a S10 and off we go.  After picking up milk, ice cream, and subs we arrive home.  
My roommate who was driving, Becky, realizes that she doens't have her house key and that our older roommate is gone.  We are stuck, locked out of our third floor apartment.  After doing some kungfu kicks on the door trying to break it down, we finally come up the idea of going to the main office and getting a copy of our key.  Yeah! Great! The office opens up at one! Oh yeah great....it was eleven thirty.  Fuck.  We sit around on the second floor banging on doors, we especially try to knock on the door of the apartment below us, cause we have this great idea to climb from the second balcony to the third floor balcony(our apartment).  No fucking answer.  I don't think that boys's can wake up before noon on a weekday.  Especially potsmoking boys.Around noonish a boy emerges from the depths of his slumber with two lady friends.  He fucking got lucky last night......  We tell them our story and the we scope out the balcony situation.  Since I am the Evel Kenevel of the group I try to scale the balconies.  WIth me standing on the second floor balcony railing.. I can grab the bottom of the railing of our balcony.  The railings are like 4 feet of the ground and I am standing on a thin ass railing two stories up trying to climb up a metal fence without using my legs.  I, being a girl, lack the neccesary upper body strength am having trouble.  I dangle from the bottom of my balcony..... so close to getting inside of my apartment being able to eat my Publix turkey sub in the comfort of my couch.  So close, but so fucking far....... Yup, this is what I think of before my end.  I don't see my life flashing before my eyes, I picture me sitting on the couch biting into a sub with a glob of mayonnaise on my face wiping it off with my shirt with my legs prooped up on the coffee table.  My grip was slipping as I was trying to pull myself up four feet of railing....My feet were searching for ground finding nothing but still air as my feet thrashed around in my chucks.   I didn't fall that time, but my time was soon to come.  My feet found the railing below me and I step onto a keg that I jimmyhatched to make a makeshift step.  We resumed sitting on the steps.  I ate my sub ate Ice cream without a spoon into our roommate came home.

After that I had played beach volleyball from like three until eight...  I found out that my good knee had a miniscus tear in it, yeah.. I said GOOD knee"

I saw so much shit, and if you are not certified I highly recommend it.  I don't think that I will ever snorkel again.  While diving I saw so many colorful fish, reefs, coral,sponges that I never want to leave.  I also saw three nurse sharks mating!  I guess the animal kingdom likes it freaky. I also saw lobsters, stingrays, thousands of fish, and snapper.  When underwater you just forget everything that was bothering you up on the surface.

Saturday I went to the keys.  This was after drving eight and a half hours from Tallahassee to Sebring to Ft. Lauderdale.  After that I had to drive two and a half hours more at seven in the morning.  I was dead tired and I slept the whole time while we were at sea fishing. My other half was down below and was spearfishing.(I hope to do this soon) He caught two grouper, one snapper, and one hogfish, but a moray eel almost bit his fin off and scared the shit out of him.

"event","What is this?  Asian girls can't have ghetto bootys!  It defeats everything that is known in the world!  Well, tis all true.  I once had a booty comparable to JLO.  

Being from a small town there is not much to do.  The main thing to do on a Fri or Sat night is to go into the woods and drink mass quantities of Bud Light.This was done by most of the local high schoolers.  My friends and I often frequented  these parties quite often.  We were masters of eluding police and letting our bladders free in bushes, without getting out pants and shoes wet(In both cases)....although there has been some accidents over the years.  Being masters at this we all had a routine down.  The person who needed to break the seal first would wait for another.  They went together, they were peeing buddies for the night.  My partner that night was ""H"" (name changed for protection).  I have not been with H a whole lot to the outskirts of parties to relieve ourselves but she was my partner that night.  Usually the routine goes like this: One girl goes behind random bush while the other girl keeps lookout for things(other girls, boys, animals) then they alternate.  But H was new I guess.  She greeted her bush(not that kind) with a yellow stream only 10 feet away from me.  She didn't know that she was supposed to wait for me to go and then it was her turn. (by the way this is why girls go the bathroom in pairs).  Just as I finished my business and about to pull up my pants a loud crashing noise was heard before me.  A crashing noise amongst the trees.  Screaming I pulled up my pants, not even realizing the earth that I had scooped up with it.  As I ran screaming for my life I forgot about H to save my own ass.  I caught up with my friends and beer stash and proceeded to tell them my story while gulping down a beer like Red Foxx from The Man Show.  Now that I slowed down and collected my thoughts I noticed a burning pain from down below(not that kind of burning) It felt like my ass was on fire(no, not hemmoroids eiether)  I was freaking out and went to the car- (this was a 1980 Ford LTD with two working doors) We all sat down inside and Lacey turned on her interiour light.  I pulled down my pants to see what the hell was happening.  My legs and hips were covered in red and pink splotches.  It seems that in my hasty departure from my makeshift bathroom, I scooped up a handful of fireants.  By this time I was howling in agony as friends were howling in laughter.  I told Lacey to get off the main drag so I coul get the ants off.  I stripped down from the waist down and started to get these ants off of me.  I used three bottles of beer and drenched my ass and girly bits to get rid of the hideous ants.  I shook my pants out and finally I was ant free.  I put my clothes back on and my friends and I returened to the party.  By then everyone found out what happened.  For some reason everybody thought that I was a hero or something because I was given free beer all that night.  My ass hurt so bad I figured I would get drunk just so I couldn't feel it anymore.  I woke up the next morning in my bed not knowing how I got there.  My ass had swelled up  to two and a half times it's size!  My ass was huge!  It looked like I had ate cornbread all my life!  This was the day when a little korean girl defied all odds and grew a ghetto booty and gave JLO a run for her money.
For two weeks afterward I scratched my ass, not hiding it from public.  I didn't give a fuck, boys do it all the time.  It itched, I scratched.  It wasn't how you think that you had a booger in your nose but you don't want to pick it because you are in public.  Me ? I didn't give a fuck and merrily scratched away no matter where I was.  From then on I was known as ""Ants in the Pants"" Frost.

"event","We look to you for guidance.  You stand there with your Dockers, beard and monotone voice, standing behind a midget podium.  Reading the book us, a forty year old to twenty somethings.  He stands talking, never looking up from his teacher's edition.  His top button is unbuttoned revealing a peek at his auburn chest hair.  Everything is big about him.  His egg shpaed head, stomach way beyond his belt, his ass tight and lumpy in his khaki's, 
and feet stuck in Wal-mart wingtips.  I wonder why his hand never comes out of his pocket.  Slight combover man trying to grab my attention and interest using a book.  Droning on an on.  Reading everything on the pages that feed his children.  
       Here we are, creatures of habit.  We come in everyday and sit in the same exact seats we sat in last week.  Carrying on the same conversations as last week.  Nothing has changed except for the clothes.  Everything else is the same.  The teacher's monotone voice fills our ears but the words don't stay.  He still stands behind his podium with hand in pocket.  His belly bigger and less hair.


You notice someone you know but not really.  Maybe someone you see in class but never talked to.  You feel obligated to give the half assed smile, and even a ""hi how you doing? Good"" 

Am sad that the highlight of the day was buying twelve rolls of toilet paper for $1.99.

Brought up making my own beer with friend.  He suggested I try making my own weed beer.  I don't even smoke.  I don't even know how to inhale...Also suggested was Meatball Beer.  Somehow this brings up scary images in my head.  Like a twelve inch hot meatball sub from Subway in a bottle of Bud Light.  The smell alone will be enough to make you sick not just slurping down fifty bottles of beer.  On further thought I think that pretzel beer will taste nice.....hmmmmm pretzel beer...

You know that you are desperate when you try to pick up guys from a gas station.  
Today I went to the PaperBack Rack  and bought some more useless language books.  MY collection now consists of Dutch, Turkish, Italian, French, Spanish, and Serb-Croation.

I find it funny that the front picture of the Dutch phrase book has an older man with missing teeth.  Is that the most attractive thing in the Netherlands?"

"event","Sitting on an ""non-jet"" aircraft waiting for my chilled beverage, I overhear the stewardess and lady passenger having a conversation.  ""I do too! ,oh my god! yes! I do too!"" the lady passenger exclaimed.  She looks like a mixture between Dixie Carter and Elaine Benes.  Only hearing the forementioned conversation it makes me wonder what they both have in common.  Did they both puncture their brains while picking their nose today?  Do they both share a love of silent ninja movies?  Do they both breakdance?  Are they in a secret society of baby eaters? Do they both sing Disney musicals in their spare time?  Do they make 3 Stooges noises when they have sex?? What? What? Oh what do they do?

Well I woke up so very very late for my 6:25am flight.  I woke up at 5:50am.  Flying throught town at 60mph(that's alot in Tally the highest speed limit is 45 and the average 35mph)I passed three cops but luckily I installed ""stealh mode combat"" on the caprice so it is invisible to any 5-0's.  Got to termianl, butted ahead of three popel and was informed I had six minutes to get to gate.  And oh wait, come with me in this little room so I can check your bag.  After, a little rummaging I was clear to go to the other security point, by this time I was three minutes to flight time.  The security checkpoint was longer than the line for Magic Mountain at Disney Land!  I raced ahead, saying ""sorry, 6:25 flight,do you mind?""  Then I saw her.  A cheap sweater on a stool.  We locked eyes, I saw pure evil.  Tiny fires were burning in her eyes.  Growling, she says that there isn't cutting in line. But I am sorry my flight is about to leave, I say. ""That is why you are supposed to gt here two hours before ma'm"" the sweater with glowing red eyes roared.  Fire consumed her face.  Was this a showdown iwth Satan, the Prince of Darkness, Lucifer himself right here in Tallahasee airport? ""Well, I asked everyone in line"",I pleaded with the Ruler of Darkness. The angelic guy piped in behind me that it was ok with him and Beezelbub grudgingly let me in.  Obviously he didn't like devils with bad sweaters and bad earrings.  I made it to the gate with one minute reamining.  I had to endure another searching of myslef and baggage.  After doing what seemed like a sobriety test I was able to board the plane.  An hour layover in Orlando.  Wasn't expecting that.  I sat and watched men attend to the plane that I was just on.  Men with kneepads.  Ha, a little humor came into my day.  Does that conjure up wicked thoughts into anyone else's brian?  Whoa! I thinkt that I just saw Jerry Garcia complete with tiedye shirt.  I wonder if Devil with cheap sweater conjred up the dead to haunt me.  Evil woman.  I hope that her earrings make her ears saggy.  Or maybe those earrings were horns?  A lady came and started a converstaion with me talking about he weather.  Hse was tall and had black stringy hair, prime canidate for HBO's taxicab confessions.

"event","Well, I am bloody sick.  I have a cold and I have been sitting around the house blowing my nose all day and wiping my hands on my shirt.  Sounds gross? Well how about this? I can't remember the last time I took a shower.  Ever noticed when someone is sick that the last thing they want to do is shower?  Well that's me!  And how come even if you do take a shower,if you are sick you still stink?  Maybe this is what I will do with my life, I will answer all my questions. 

Fuck school, it is only a waste of time and money.

Self-censorship.  Everybody does it.  We hide our feelings from others due to the fact that they will judge us against what we think of ourselves.

I think that exactly matching sweaters and hats are just to much.  Also, wearing shorts with a big bulky sweater is just ridiculous.

Anybody wearing all black tennis shoes not at work should be shot.

Another day,same old routine.  I hit the snooze button three or four times.  Finally drag ass to the shower.  I pee while the water gets hot.  Wash hair first, slowly waking up.  Then body,then face.  Then stand letting the water warm me.  Turn the water off, grope for a towel, finding none.  I sprint to my bedroom trying to find the towels from the night before wadded up on my floor.  Finding them still wet, I wrap the wettest around my hair, and stand in front of the mirror naked trying to look for the fat that has sprouted there over night.  I brush my teeth with my black toothbrush and stare blankly at the mirror.  Reading my feel good chinese fortunes that I had taped up to make me happy.  ""Someone special admires you"", and ""Rarely does great beauty and virtue dwell together as they do in you"".  Look around for my favorite jeans, fuck it if I wore them yesterday. I don't give a damn.  Finish getting dressed and grab water(to get that sickenly sweet taste of toothpaste out of mouth) head out the door.  This happens everyday that I have school.  In fact it is going to happen tommorow.

"event","Well, the time has come to share myself with the world.  No longer will I be selfish and keep me to myself.  Born into relativly normal home.  Three bedroooms, two bathrooms...complete normalcy.  Two parents and one brother. I am half and half ethnicity.  One half being Korean which will keep me thin and young all my life.  My father looks like a mid western beer guzling bowler, complete with gut.  
I am a young girl trying to find her purpose in life.  I am intersted in the oddest things yet do not own an interest that would easliy get me a college degree.  I hate school with a passion and do not own the ambition to make something out of myself.  I don't find living five days out of the week 9-5 in a cubicle ""making something out of myself.""  With that college seems useless.  College makes us dull so we can spend the rest of our lives living out the same days, and being happy with it.  We are gradually turning in to mind numbing zombies, yet no one realizes it because we are ""successful""
Being in the shadow of a great mind and supposed life is very hard.  My brother is seven years older than me and has what my mom calls ""made it"".  He graduated full scholarship from Florida State and became a Chemical Engineer.  Graduated third in his class just so he didn't have to do a speech.  Where as I, lost my scholarship my first year in college and graduated with a respectable GPA but lower in the totem pole.  

I try to be my ownself, not being a conformist. (hey, I resisted the fucking stupid butterfly clips taht girls were wearing a couple of years of go)  I try hard to be open minded (my older cousin recently got married to another lesbian)  But what in the world can I do that makes me happy and money at the same time realistically? nothing.

Well, I went out to a club tonight and I was on a mission to get drunk.  Twenty three jello shots later and nothing has happened except for my nice rosy cheeks. This surprised me cause I haven't gotten drunk in about a year.  I went to Latin Night at Atlantis and I shaked my groove thing for what it was worth(or least I tried to).  It scared me of the number of sweaty men tried to dance with me and my friends.  It being so late right now and I have to wake up early to go house shopping.  I am in dire need of a house,job, tan.  It has been so cold lately.  Like fucking forties and what not.  I long to be in Sebring where I can wake up and get on the lake to go wakeboarding.  



When I was around four I used to live on a military base.  Parallel to my road was a playground.  I used to go there with my other little friends and my stuffed animal of big bird with a blue shirt on him that said friend.  (jealous anyone?) Well I guess the thought never occurred to me to go home when I needed to go the bathroom, I just went right then and there.  Fuck bathrooms.  I just kept on swinging in the swing taking a big ole shit. When you are little swings are the shit, not just things to shit on.  When it was time for me to go home I would waddle(just like a penguin, so the shit wouldn't actually touch me all that much)with my big bird in hand.  I would then get washed off with the garden house in the front yard.

In kindergarten, my class was at recess, not at the sandbox but at the playground.  I had to pee so badly but I figured I could wait until recess was over.  I didn't want to waste one moment.  Well, in line to wait to go down the slide, I sat waiting at the top. The kids and I were going to do the train, where three or four kids would go at a time down the slide.  I was at the very top.  Well, I couldn't hold it any longer and I let my river flow.

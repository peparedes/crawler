"event","life is only as good as the memories we make,
and i'm taking back what belongs to me.
Polaroids of classrooms unattended
These relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks,
only they're gone faster than the smell after it rains.

if you could go anywhere right now, where would you go?
and would you miss me when you get there?

i don't think i ever told you
but i know you always did you best
and the hard times, they only made us stronger

rachel come over to my house, 'cause you're the one for me
we'll drink cheap wine and watch for shooting stars"

"event","i wrote a song today that kinda of dealt with my depression problem.  i think it helped. i don't feel better about the reasons i'm depressed but i think i won't appear as depressed anymore. it's a start."

"event","i wish that i could have like three wishes or something. that would be swell.  and i could wish for anything i want.  the odd thing, though, is probably that none of my wishes would be for anything material.  is that weird?"

"event","so she lies to me. and breaks promises. the two things that i can't stand.  it's like a slap to the face.  it may be over little things, but now i have to wonder if there's anything else that she's lying about.  and i've dealt with this smoking thing for six months now.  it's not healthy, for her of course, but for me to, having to be around it all the time.  it's the only time i'm disgusted by her too.  she's the most attractive girl i know until she lights up a cigarette, then it's the total opposite.  and the smell. she always smells like stale cigarettes.  and all im trying to do is help.  i want us to be together forever, but doing that shit certainly wont' help.  i wanna have kids someday too, but not with someone who smokes and will fuck up a kid and give em all kinds of defects because of it.  but worst of all she lied to me, staight to my face.. then laughed at me like it didn't matter. and broke a promise.  of all the people i know, i thought she was the one person i could count on not to do either."

"event","well look at this... i'm bored enough (and can't sleep) so i'm writing in this stupid thing.  but at least i can 'dedicate' an entry to my honey:

Where are you?
Please believe in me.
I'm not hanging up the phone
'til i hear you say,
""I love you.
I need you near.""

Oh and what i wouldn't give
Just to kiss your lips again
To hold your hand next to my heart
And wake up with you in our apartment.

Just one last time
Can i call you my sweetheart?
My best friend
Why do all good things come to an end.
( quite frankly, i'm used to good things coming to an end, but i'm pretty sure we won't)"

"event","I often wonder if fate is a real thing. I'm not very religious, but i always had a strange belief in fate. That no matter what i did, things would always work out in the end because it was supposed to. But then i hate thinking that what if it's not a real thing, and some of the choices in my life were wrong and can't be corrected. maybe i think too much."

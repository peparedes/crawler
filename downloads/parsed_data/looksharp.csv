And can you see

Many times
We've been out drinking
And many times
We've shared our thoughts

But did you ever, ever notice
The kind of thoughts I got

Well you know I have a love
A love for everyone I know
And you know I have a drive
To live I won't let go

But can you see it's opposition
Comes a-rising up sometimes
That it's dreadful and position
Comes blacking in my mind

Confusion in her eyes that says it all, 
She's lost control. 
And she's clinging to the nearest passer-by, 
She's lost control. 
And she gave away the secrets of her past, 
And said: I've lost control again, 
And of a voice that told her when and where to act, 
She said: I've lost control again.

And she turned to me and took me by the hand and said, 
I've lost control again.
And how I'll never know just why or understand, 
She said: I've lost control again.
And she screamed out kicking on her side and said, 
I've lost control again.
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die.
She said I've lost control. 
She's lost control again. 
She's lost control. 
She's lost control again. 
She's lost control.

Well I had to phone her friend my case, 
And say she's lost control again. 
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes, 
And said I've lost control again. 
But she expressed herself in many different ways, 
Until she lost control again. 
And walked upon the edge of no escape, 
And laughed I've lost control. 
She's lost control again. 
She's lost control. 
She's lost control again. 
She's lost control."

<P>Your body might recognize that your brain is actually singing <EM>Starman</EM> by David Bowie as covered by Seu Jorge (in Portuguese) so your body can at least hum along, but this may make the separation&nbsp;between <STRONG>mind</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and<STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body</STRONG>&nbsp;even more severe because you know all of the words in English but you can't, for the life of you, wrap your tongue around the tantalizing, teasing gibberish Portuguese that your BRAIN is sending you.</P>
<P>So once you have successfully completed this schism [which is really no big feat...as stated above, it is quite simple], you will soon discover that the true challenge falls in the realm of&nbsp;trying to force your mindandbody to work together again. There will be many times that you will <EM>think</EM> you have accomplished this...getting high, a sunny day, going barefoot are the big tricksters, and perhaps they denote a smaller connection...but the cat's meow of <STRONG>mindbodysynthesis</STRONG>&nbsp; is <EM>tears of joy</EM>. Really. When you find someone who has imperfections so perfectly arranged that they confuse both your body and mind so much that your happiness becomes sadness--you can't believe you are lucky enough to have this brilliant confusion-that is Bliss.</P>

"event","The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said: 

""If you please--draw me a sheep!"" 

""What!"" 

""Draw me a sheep!"""

"event","What a strange, strange boy
He sees the cars as sets of waves
Sequences of mass and space
He sees the damage in my face

We got high on travel
And we got drunk on alcohol
And on love the strongest poison and medicine of all
See how that feeling comes and goes
Like the pull of moon on tides
Now I am surf rising
Now parched ribs of sand at his side
What a strange, strange boy
I gave him clothes and jewelry
I gave him my warm body
I gave him power over me

"event","<center> ok,so .. this past month has had the most changes that my life has ever gone through. They are good changes. life is crazy.

School is over, thank God. I have been out for about 3 weeks now. and my grades were awesome. so im 99.9% positive that i got into the nursing program. Only  3 of us out of my group of friends, of like 10, know that our grades met the standards for the program. That's how hard this fuckin program is ... it was one crazy year. i feel proud though, that i was one of the few that proved that i can do it.

Jonathan and I borke up over a month ago, and I have been doing pretty good, actually very good, considering we were together for 4 fuckin years. 

I am now seeing this guy Charlie, and he is amazing, and of coarse he is in the Marines, just my luck ... i meet an awesome guy and he is in the military, marines of all. but i fall for him more and more. He's the polar opposite of Jonathan hahaha. I love being around Charlie, he's so much fun.

The other day I was talkin to someone who said something to me that I never thought I would hear, especially from him, he said ""damn sarah, you didn't give anyone a chance to get you"" ... it made my day thats fer sure. but it has been surprising at how many people told me similar things in this past month. i never thought anyone really noticed me."

yea, so if most of you didn't know, me and jonathan have broken up. It's been a week now. we have our reasons. it was a great four years.

school is almost over and I can't wait! Finals are approaching and i have like freshmanitis lol. I just want it to be summer. I'm sick of all the drama here at school. it's all girl, what did i expect? haha

I can't wait till next year, Im almost positive that I will get in the nursing program, so that's exciting. I can't wait till we start clinicals, that should be interesting haha. 

I also can't wait till next year because i will be roomming with someone who isn't insane and is my best friend haha. I love her, her name is Liz.

Yesterday was the last time the OC will EVER film here again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAYAYAYAYAYA. haha. it was graduation. it's really fucking annoying when they are here. I wish I was as skinny as Mischa Barton. She had the cutest dress on.

anyways, how is everyone else doing?"

"event","<p>wow, i haven't been on here in forever.<br /><br />It's weird seeing all your posts and thinking about how much my life has change since highschool. I have made so many new friends and have just made a&nbsp;totally different life for myself, and I love it.<br /><br />My life has consisted of school, friends, and jonathan. Both of our lives have changed, and&nbsp;so&nbsp;has our relationship. It is so much stronger. I dont know what i would do without him.&nbsp;<br /><br />School is so hard and so time consuming. I thought this semester was going to be a breeze compared to last semester, but was I wrong. I wish I could go back to last year, but then again I love this year, and dont want to go back. Now that i think about it, i&nbsp;don't want to go back. My friends are so awesome, my relationship with jonathan is so much stronger, and i have just grown up so much this year now that i think back to it.&nbsp;<br /><br />The drama is definately there, but it's not like highschool, thats for sure. like my&nbsp;roommate getting pregnant, then supposedly having a miscarriage, but we all know she went to plan parenthood. ha.&nbsp;<br /><br />I just can't put into words how much this year has changed me and how much fun it has been.<br /></p>"

It's so awesome too because cory is there. hi cory! lol. but jonathan already has close friends and a best friend there in so. carolina (they met in bootcamp). i met a couple of them at his grad. im so proud of him :).

"event","Here's Jonathan, reporting from bootcamp:

Hey everyone,
Man this sucks. Its like a mix between bnad camp and maximum security prison. No, it's not so bad. I'm getting use to it. I've done pretty well so far, and apparently we have gotten past the worst week (week 2). It's suppose to feel much faster and much less pointless from now on. My days have been filled with inspections (to make sure my underwear and everything are ironed and folded properly), PT, IT (intensive training- punishment), lots of eating, yelling, and cleaning. We clean a lot. A LOT. LOTS.

The food  here is bearable, but the gas it produces is rancid (and it produces a lot). My RDCs are the best in my ship (we are the best division so far thanks to them) and are also the least difficult to deal with. They teach us what we are suppose to do rather than beat us for not doing it, after not being taught, which the other divisions do. Don't get me wrong, our chief can be ruthless when it comes to discipling us.

I heard the Air Force Boot CAMP is easy as hell. I won't go into what they do, but if you decide to join the ""military"" and don't want to stop being a civilian, join the Air Force. If you want to join a real military, join the navy or the marines. Don't do Army. Just my words of advice. Actually I'm hoping that someone will join to keep me company.

Ok, I need some letters. My address is:

(ok so i already gave you guys the address and dont feel like typing it out again. So if you want it, go to my live journal entries)

 (now back to jonathan)  WRITE ME!!!! I wanna know everyone is. Let me know what is going on back at home. Send me some pictures. Marching Band has helped me so much with this whole thing. A lot of the discipline, marching, leadership, and experience with large groups carries over into this. I'm a section leader here, which is much like a section leader in the band. It's pretty cool- I get a collar device (two chevrons and an eagle). Ok, I hope everyone is doing well! Merry Christmas, and Chanika (i had to spell it like he did in the letter LOL), and enjoy Kwanza and what not, and happy new years! TTYL WRITE ME!!!!!!!



-Jonathan


ahhhh ... i miss him sooo much. I look forward to his letters sooo much. I started crying becasue i thought iw asn't going to get one this week, because i got one on thursday last week, and the only days he can write are on sundays. but i was very releaved to see i got one from him. :) HIS MOM BAUGHT ME A PLANE TICKET (ALONG WITH HER'S AND JAMES') TO GO SEE HIS GRADUATION!!!!!!!!!! I was so excited when she told me.



Omg!!! Im so happy. ASOLUTELY NO SCHOOL FOR A WHOLE MONTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but i already miss my friends. :("

O.M.G i just wanted to grab my clarinet and run onto the field and start playing with them. i just wanted to stay there and watch the practice lol. i also saw ben, haha. but he didn't see me. they sounded awesome. i kept telling my friends that we should go back and watch lol, and they just laughed at me. im such a nerd. but i really do wish i could play in that band. i think i can (seeing as my school is the sister school to UCLA) but i just dont have time. maybe i'll transfer in a couple years lol, just for the band. anyway, just thought i would tell you guys.

Walter came out with out a scratch, but cynthia didn't. They hit a telephone pole and it took the firefighters 25 minutes to get it off of her. Walter was speeding in order to check if his brakes were working properly, not a smart idea. Walter is one of my frends and i am happy that he is ok, but what he did was extremely irresponsible. Cynthia was one of my lab partners for anatomy last year along with my friend parissa, and they were really good friends. It's so weird .... me and cynthia also go to the same church and got confirmed the same year. I can't believe it. She was so gorgeous and had so much ahead of her.</P>"

"event","My psych professor said FUCK in class today, lol, but in context with what we were talking about. it was pretty funny.

we had a freakin fire drill at 9 30 in the pm last night! crazy people. so me and amanda walk in our room after the fire drill and our room smells like shit lol, literally, shit. So we sprayed air freshner throughout the room and bathroom, and one of sweetmates walk in and was like, ""I'm so sorry guys!!"" lol. our sweetmates our the girls that share the bathroom with us. we were laughing so hard, not becasue she smelled everything up, but because it smelled and she was embarrssed lol. So, we talked it over and now we are not emabarrassed to say that we have to take a shit LOL. ahh... Karen was like "" well that sux that my shit had to be the one that like broke the ice"" lol. I mean, what the heck? you can hold a shit for a whole year, ya kno? lol. its perfectly natural.

now i have to go study for anatomy with hannah.

why do we have to worry about whats normal and absurd, or conformity. just be yourself. i kno we do have it in our society, but i dont think we should lol. normal should just mean being yourself, that should be the norm."

"event","So, as most of you know, the O.C. films at my school. Today they happen to be filming. Everybody is like freaking out and its really annoying lol, and its quite an inconvenience when trying to get to class because all the film crap is like right in my path way to my classes. I did see adam brody though, that was kind cool lol. Its hard to tell where to go and stuff too, because there are extras everywhere and you cant tell where you can and cant walk. so i jus walk across the circle not caring at all lol. I personally have never watched a full episode yet. I aonly watched it a little bit once, to see if they were at mt st marys at all.

<P>GOD! I dont get it. I've been in this different happy mode, this different feeling in my new life, but then when i think i have gotten rid of all those old feelings of being sad and depressed, it happens. jus .. SNAP! here they are, the same problems, and they bring back all these horrible memories of how i use to feel at home in simi, laying in bed and crying myself to sleep every other night. It's weird. I feel like i live in a different world now, but then i realize that my old world isn't going to go away jus because im in college now, everything is still with me, i jus live somewhere else. Its actually making things&nbsp;worse now. At this point i feel like im beating a dead horse. You know, i get all excited about coming home during the weekend, but once i enter simi this flood of jus, boredom and what am i going to actually do this weekend that i should be so&nbsp;happy about?, rushes through me.</P>

"event","<P>It's real now. I didn't think it was actually going to happen, in that i knew it was gunna happen but jus couldn't. jackie is gone. I thought that if I didn't admit to it, it wasn't really going to happen.&nbsp;this is the first time im actually admitting it, and my head is spinning like mad. I'm not suppose to be doing this alone. Jackie has always been right beside me or behind me in lines waiting to get our IDs, or going to the first day of 1st grade together and being attatched to the hip all through&nbsp;elementry school&nbsp;, or being there with me on the first day of 6th grade going into the big bad world of middle school,&nbsp;crying with me because we both didn't want to be in band,&nbsp;being there right next to me when we moved to simi in the middle of 7th grade and we were eachothers only friends, she was there&nbsp;walking with me to 1st period&nbsp;band on the first day of highschool, being the first to congradulate me on making first chair clarinet because she was the one who came with me to check, and then being half the reason i joined marching band, she was&nbsp;always there when i had a&nbsp;question on my hw, she was always with me in the back room hanging out when mary was getting yelled at, lol, she was standing right next to me when Royal played the show for the seniors one last time,&nbsp;and then we had our final walk together .... graduation. She was right next to me then. You know, it may have seemed that sometimes i hated being in the same grade with her, but i loved every single moment of it, and I wouldn't have had at any other way. I never had to worry about being alone when going into something new, because she was always doing&nbsp;it with me. I always had someone to talk to to. She was my permanant best friend. I couldn't cry at the airport this moening, i dunno for some reason i couldn't show her, and i looked at mary and she was crying her eyes out, i felt horrible. Seeing jackie go up the escaltor and seeing the tears in her eyes made our lives together these past 12 years flash before my eyes. i couldn't believe this was actually&nbsp;happening. I didn't think i would take it this hard.&nbsp;I wish everyone could experience what i have with their sister or brother. I wouldn't trade anything.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I dont know what I'm gunna&nbsp;do without you Jackie.&nbsp;I love you.</P>"

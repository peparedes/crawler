"event","Hey guys!  

I know it's been awhile since I've updated but I've been a busy little bee lately!  Work at Gadzooks is going well.  I work about 20-25 hours a week-- crazy, I know but the money is good!  School is going very well-- I'm doing great in all of my classes except for one but it's still early and I can still improve.  I'm hoping for another 3.5 semester.  My sorority, CHI OMEGA is amazing!  I love it and all my new sisters/friends.  I've been really busy with that, but I love every minute of it.  I think joining Chi Omega was the best thing I could have ever done because I don't think I've been this happy in a long time!  We have Serenades Tuesday, which is when we go and do a dance that we made up and have been working on in front of all the fraternity boys.  Should be fun and interesting and I'm really looking forawrd to it.  Friends, well my friends are doing great.  I miss everyone from home though A LOT and if I seem like I don't have time to talk or time for you guys-- I'm sorry:(  I just hope you guys understand that this will all change soon-- I'm in a very hectik period of life right now!  I can't wait to come home for Thanksgiving and part of Christmas and see all of you.  I do have all intentions of visiting MSU, U of M, and Central soon-- so no worries!  As for the boy status, Dave and I did get back together a few weeks ago but split up last Tuesday.  It was hard, but I'm dealing with it well and I truly believe we will get back together soon.  I miss him like crazy, but I know everything will work out in the end.  He's amazing and that's all there is to it!:)  Family-- well my family is doing great minus a few problems here and there.  My mom had surgery about 2 weeks ago and is doing great now, I miss her like WHOA.  My step-dad is doing good too with his job and health and everything.  I miss him and my mom lots!  My Dad and sister are great-- I miss them a lot too.  Megan got an internship for student teaching at Cousino and that's going good for her.  I'm glad she likes what she's doing:)  My Dad just had his birthday last week and I wish I could have been home for it to celebrate, but I couldn't because of school and crap:(  And as for Oreo, she's still the crazy dog she's been.  I miss her like crazy because as you all know, I'm in love with my dog!  As for me-- I love life and every part of it.  I play intramural volleyball on Thursdays with a few of my sorority sisters.  Our team is really good and I just miss playing so much!  I've been stressed lately with everything going on all at once, but soon things will calm down.  The days are long but fun!  I can't wait for Acapulco with my all my girls because it's just gonna be a CRAZY FUN time!  But basically, I've just been working, going to classes, doing my sorority stuff and making as much time as possible for my friends and family and of course FUN TIME!  Like I said, life is great and I love it!  Anyways, that's about it for now!  I hope everyone has a great Halloween because I know I will staying in and working on my 3 presentations due this week along with my 2 papers and 2 exams!  YIKES!  Wish me luck!

Love all of you and miss you bunches!  XoXo~ Jen



P.S.  Who's coming up and staying with me WMU/CMU weekend?  Let me know so I can make proper arrangements!;)"

"event","Well it has definitely been awhile since I've written in this thing!  With finals next week, life is quickly becoming so stressful and hecktic.  I haven't really been up to all that much lately.  Hangin out with my girls and partyin it up when there is time to actually have fun!  Thanksgiving break was wonderful!  Had breakfast/dinner with the family at our house then I went to my Dads later on at night.  Put together a big plate of food since he didn't have any plans.  Hung out with my mom most of the time over break which was awesome.  If you know our relationship, then you will know why.  My mom is my best friend and it's hard being 2 1/2 hours away from someone you're so close to.  We definitely did get up at 4am the day after Thanksgiving to get the bargain deals.  Went to Kohl's and were like the 5th people in line standing out in the freezing cold at 5am.  I worked one day at the Peel too and made some pretty damn good money.  I really need to work a lot during Christmas, but we'll see what happens that.  I have a lot on my agenda and am in dire need to see all my friends! <333  Hung out with the guys and went to Beriut Palace (hookah bar) and went back to Chris' house with everyone one of the nights.  Saw my girl Karolin, misssss you!  Decorated the house for Christmas with my mom and just spent a lot of much needed quality time with my family.  Came back to school on Sunday and just studied my butt off for the last quiz.  After tomorrow I am officially done with all my classes minus my ONLY two finals on Thursday.  It will be nice to have another 5 days off, but who knows what I'll do with myself.  You can only stay occupied for so long until it gets boring.  This weekend is going to consist of doing nothing but working on my English portfolio which is worth a whopping 70% of our grade!  Tomorrow night the girls and I are doing pizza and movies and just hangin out.  I really do love all the new friends I've made here.  I couldn't be any happier and I'm so glad I decided to go away.  So today, my girls I'm living with next year we signed our lease at University Club!  I am beyond excited to live with them.  We are going to have a blast and I just cannot wait, although we will have to work harder than we play for sure.  These girls are just awesome and have the greatest personalities.  I'm really glad that everything worked out for the better in the end.  I can't believe that this semester is just a week away from being over.  It's amazing how time flies when you're havin fun!  I'm doing so good in all of my classes and I'm so proud of myself.  I'm going for a GPA of 3.5 and I know I'm really close to that and it's just so awesome to have one that high.  Never did I ever have close to that in high school, so I'm just in awe with myself.  I've proved to a lot of people (friends, family, acquaintences, etc) that I can do it.  I'm very excited to say the least for Christmas break.  I have a feeling this will be probably the best one ever!  Adrienne and I are seeing the Rockettes December 14 and I'm really looking forward to that.  I've always wanted to go see them and I finally have the chance to.  I'm finally installing a new radio in my car too.  It's been since July I've been without a radio since them assholes decided to break in my car and steal it!  I don't have all that much Christmas shopping to do this year either which is nice-- definitely will be saving!  I wish I had the money to be able to buy like the perfect gifts for everyone, but I'm on an extremely low budget, so I guess thats why I need to work!  Well I guess thats a run down of whats been up!

"event","<P>Well where to begin?&nbsp; First off, this is going to be an extremely long entry because I have so much to write and tell ya'll!&nbsp; So the past week has been great, however, with a few exceptions but it's okay!&nbsp; I ended off with Friday, so I'll start with Saturday of last weekend...</P>
<P><STRONG>Saturday</STRONG> was fairly well.&nbsp; Didn't really do much during the day, but went out later.&nbsp; Lauren called me up, so her, Kelly and myself went out for a bit and saw Team America!&nbsp; That was by far one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in a long time.&nbsp; Definitely had some good times with the girls there!</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Me</FONT>: ""Where's that at?""&nbsp; <BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Lauren</FONT>: ""Jen, it's Washington D.C.""&nbsp; <BR>*Oooops, definitely had a blonde moment:-\<BR>Before the movies, Kyle called me up to lemme know of a party out in the Heights.&nbsp; I told him no because I was headin out with the girls, but I wound up tryin to go there after the show and of course, Jen got lost!&nbsp; I swear, I have no sense of direction.&nbsp; Got a call and went to go help a friend, but plans failed, so I came home around like 2ish and called it a night.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sunday</STRONG> was boring for the most part.&nbsp; Went back to school and just studied my butt off for a Sociology quiz the next day.</P>
<P><STRONG>Monday</STRONG> just watched the shows with David- the girls were all busy.&nbsp; Didn't do too much besides homework, TV and nap!</P>
<P><STRONG>Tuesday</STRONG> was bettter.&nbsp; Actually made it to all my classes!&nbsp; It's rough having a 9:30am class.&nbsp; Took a nap (like always) and then went to my English class.&nbsp; My buddy Andy was nice enough to drive me back to the valleys since it was so cold, so yay for that!&nbsp; Watched Real World and Laguna Beach with the girls and that was pretty much.&nbsp; Found out some bad news, which totally sucks.&nbsp; It definitely ruined my week, but oh well what are ya gonna do?&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Wednesday</STRONG> was alright.&nbsp; Made it to all of my classes again.. 2 days in a row is good for me!&nbsp; Had conferences with my English teacher about my paper and it went real well.&nbsp; She said how I'm an phenominal writer and I should definitely take more writing classes.&nbsp; That made my day better for sure.&nbsp; Later on went and visited Staci in valley 3.&nbsp; We hung out for a few hours, did some homework and just chilled.&nbsp; After I left her place, I went and visited Kaz n Jon.&nbsp; Stayed there for a bit and then Jon walked me back up to my room and that was that!</P>
<P><STRONG>Thursday</STRONG> I had NO classes!&nbsp; It was a wonderful day for sure.&nbsp; Slept in until about 11-11:30ish, ate a little and then watched TV with Kit-Kat and wound up fallin asleep AGAIN!&nbsp; Packed up for the weekend to come home, did a few other things and hung out w/Jon later.&nbsp; We were supposed to all go to Deja Vu (a strip club, for all of you who dont know), but that fell through.&nbsp; Other than that, didn't do too much!</P>
<P><STRONG>Friday</STRONG> was a great day for sure.&nbsp; Went to my classes and then came home with Will and Staci.&nbsp; Showered real fast, then headed off to my job interview at Circuit City!&nbsp; That went very good and I have a second interview during Thanksgiving break.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; definitely good because I need to work mad hours during Christmas break.&nbsp; Between there (if I get the job) and Orange Peel, I'll be set with money for hopefully the rest of the school year.&nbsp; After that, I came back ate dinner and went out with Kiki, my Smooth Criminal buddy!:-D&nbsp; We were going to just get dessert and catch up, but we wound up stopping into Chucks and visiting Paula!&nbsp; I havent been there since I got fired and it's definitely different.&nbsp; I miss it, but it's not for me anymore.&nbsp; Ohh well!&nbsp; So after being there for about an hour or so, we headed to Applebee's and got dessert.&nbsp; YuMmM!&nbsp; We left around 10:30 and I met up w/the guys to go bowling with everyone.&nbsp; That was what was supposed to happen, but didnt.&nbsp; We all just wound up goin to the movies and seeing Saw.&nbsp; It was a good movie, but I'm a whimp and get scared easily so my face was covered with my scarf most of the time.&nbsp; HaHa!&nbsp; Came back around 1ish and that was that!</P>
<P><STRONG>Today</STRONG> has been decent so far.&nbsp; Cant say it wasn't a let down because if I did, I'd be lying to myself.&nbsp; Went in this morning for my MRI.&nbsp; It was alright- kinda scary, but really annoying.&nbsp; Oh well at least it's done and over with and I don't have to come home again until Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Went and ran some errands with my Mom and then came back.&nbsp; Stayed here for a little while then went shoppin with Adrienne.&nbsp; Always a great way to get my frustrations out:o)&nbsp; After the mall, we hit up a few more places and now I'm here.&nbsp; Hopefully tonite will be awesome- I'm looking forward to it!&nbsp; </P>
<P>So that's whats been up with me lately.&nbsp; A short run down, but to the point.&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to Thanksgiving and Christmas break.. I can't wait to see everyone again!&nbsp; I miss ya'll a lot.&nbsp; A possible trip to State soon with Staci is in the picture to see Lauren and everyone else.&nbsp; I'm excited to go party there for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm really hoping to get the job at Circuit City with the guys.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;it'd definitely be fun!&nbsp; I'm hoping over Christmas break to be working at least&nbsp;40 hours a week- I really need to!&nbsp;&nbsp;December 14th, Adrienne, myself, and her family are all going to see the Rockettes perform.&nbsp; I've always wanted to see them, so&nbsp;I'm looking forward to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I schedule my classes Monday morning at 7am, yuck!&nbsp; I don't like getting up early as it is and to have to be up around&nbsp;6:30 am is totally going to suck.&nbsp; I'm hoping to schedule it so that I have no&nbsp;Friday classes or classes&nbsp;past 3pm.&nbsp; My neighbor got a new puppy, sooo cute!&nbsp; He's a black sharpae and black lab mix.&nbsp; His name is Monny and he's soooo adorable.&nbsp; Oreo now has a new friend to play with, which is good.&nbsp; I love the holiday season, but&nbsp;it's depressing not having someone to share it with.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows maybe that'll change one day, but I have my doubts.&nbsp; Other than that, I think that's really it.&nbsp; Not too much else goin on in my life, so I hope ya'll enjoy reading this!</P>

"event","<P>So the past few days have been very interesting to say the least! Here's how it goes (it's going to be long!)... </P>
<P><STRONG>Tuesday</STRONG> was Election Day and no homework! I hung out with my &lt;3 girls &lt;3 and watched Real World and Laguna Beach and all the Election stuff. Maranda and I decided it would be fun to start yelling out our window to support Kerry/Edwards. Well that resulted in a nice valley 2 riot and it was quite interesting!&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Wednesday</STRONG> had no homework AGAIN! Found out that Bush/Cheney won the election. That ticked me off majorly. The economy is going to fall even more, which will result in even more inflation. There will be a draft soon, so I think. I just don't get how Bush could win again. Can people not see that he has done close to nothing good for our country?&nbsp; But whatever. Took my Math pretest and did fairly well, so that was a plus. Later on, Kat and I watched movies on Lifetime most of the night and that was that! </P>
<P><STRONG>Thursday</STRONG> was an overall great day! Went to my classes and packed up to head home for the weekend. My mom had like mini surgery and I had to get things done for all these tests I have to have next week, so that's why I had to leave. Found out I got a 3.8 out of a 4.0 scale on my English paper &lt;~~ made my day! Came back from my classes, took a nap and headed off to the train station. The train was an hour late, so that really pissed me off. But I have to say that this ride was by far better than the last one even with the delay. I ended up meeting three new awesome people that go to Western. They kept me occupied the whole 3 1/2 hrs, so that was goooood. Finally got home around 2am! Stayed up and chatted with my mom and Oreo (both were very excited to see me:o)!) Bed at 3am </P>
<P><STRONG>Today</STRONG> was a great day by far! Woke up, hung out with my mom and Oreo for most of the day. Got blood drawn for my tests next weekend and ran some errands. Talked to Adrienne and we went out for awhile. It was nice and I love that girl sooo much. She's always there for me and always has been and that is what makes her such a great friend! Came home, took a nap, ate dinner and watched a movie with the family then eventually showered and ventured on out. Originally, Kelly, Chris, Lauren, myself and others were supposed to go bowling, but Lauren got side tracked leavin State. Chris and I went to Big Boy's and got some dessert to pass by time and had some nice conversations especially about politics since we both agree on the same things. Soo Lauren called and we met her and Kelly up at Nationals. My fatass ate again! After that we took off to a hotel parrrrtay! Verrrry fun and met some new people. It's kinda weird how small the world is when you meet someone who knows people you party with up at school. We stayed there for awhile, then we took off for the night. Overall it was a great night! I reallllly missed them all and it was great catching up especially since I haven't seen them for such a longgg time. </P>
<P>So lately I've been doing a lot of thinkin since the homework has been light. I've realized some a lot of things through all of this. Some good and some bad, so here it goes... </P>
<P>-I don't like the fact that I feel like I'm being used by some people </P>
<P>-I don't like how I'm so <STRONG>nieve</STRONG> and won't accept the truth even when it's been shown plenty of times</P>
<P>+I love Western and I love all my new friends I've made ESPECIALLY Kit-Kat, Anna Bananna, Moe, and Sam &lt;3 </P>
<P>+I do have a great life even though it doesn't go how I always want it to </P>
<P>-I miss all of my friends from Central, State and U of M and from the Heights too;o)</P>
<P>-I feel like I've lost contact with so many people from high school (mainly my fault)</P>
<P>&nbsp;+I'm going to try and reinstate the lost friendships</P>
<P>-I do <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> like being lied to </P>
<P>-I don't like feeling like I'm being blown off either (people, I really can accept the truth)</P>
<P>+Thanksgiving Break is in 3 weeks and Christmas in 5 weeks, which means lots of time to hang out with everyone!&nbsp; Can't wait:-D</P>
<P>+Chris and Kelly possibly getting me jobs at Circuit City and h00ters!</P>
<P>+Hanging out with friends I haven't seen in a long time:-D</P>
<P>+Being happy all the time</P>
<P>So this nice long entry basically sums everything up!&nbsp; Some of these points are directed to certain people, so if you think one of the negatives might be you, it probably is!&nbsp; Other than that, I think that's it!&nbsp; Make sure ya'll comment it up&lt;3</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>XoXo</P>

Finally decided to update this thing after a long time.  In case you didn't know, I'm up at Western now and I absolutely love it.  Have made some of the greatest friends ever & I wouldn't trade them for anything!  I have an awesome roomie, Kit-Kat and she's the best one ever.  Definitely some good times in 405 LeFevere!  Anyways, here's what was up for this weekend...


Friday: Longggg day!  Didn't do much of anything except hang out with my girls.  It was nice to catch up:o)

Saturday: Took care of some business for most of the day.  It was CMU/WMU weekend and unfortunately WMU lost, although they should have won!  Later on I dyed my hair dark brown with blonde and red highlights- super cute!  Went out and partied it up with my girls!  Big party and it was a great time!  Everybody looked so cute, espically my Lady Marmalad girls.  I went as a prisoner, although the outfit was a bit different.  It was super cute and sexy, just had to see it to know.  Definitely had some good times, thanks girls! <3

Sunday: HaLLoWeeN!  Didn't even do anything today, just kinda hung out and relaxed.  Movie night and popcorn with my homies and that's probably it.


As for the love life, there currently isn't one; however, there is a definitely a crush on someone;)  Hopefully things will go in the direction I'd like them too, but only time will tell.  Just gotta wait and see what fate has in store for this one, but let's just hope somethin good:-D


Anyways, I think that's about it!

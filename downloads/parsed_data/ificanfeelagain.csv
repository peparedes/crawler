"event","Well herro herro,

So im sitting in the super 8 in grand prairie looking forward to comming home tomorrow and i figured i should do somthing to pass the time, So since i have nothing better to do teh journal update it is. So far work is still just as amazing now as it was a year ago. I have gotten a very good reputation with the ampm and with the clients and it showed when i got my raise this year, still not six figures but halfway to it so im not going to complain. 

Ive seen alot of westren canada and met some amazing people. So far the best trip i have had was to vancouver island, but there have been some good times in winnipeg as well. I should have enought flyer miles to go to mexico by this time next year lol. So far i have been to the following places: Winnipeg (2nd Home now), Dawson creek (couldnt find joey), Thompson Manitoba (Middle of fucking nowhere), Nanimo (meth meth meth...meh), Vancouver Airport, Ft St John, Teulon (45 mins outside of winnipeg), Vermillion (Install Was Fun), Grand prairie (Closes at 11 like kimberley), Salmon arm and kelowna (vacation here i come...so fucking nice out there). Still havent managed to hit saskatchewan but im sure i will.....I wonder if dog river is ready for storepoint..only fans of corner gas will get that one. I think im going to try to do an entry for each place ive gone to. That way i can keep this updated and it will waste some time for me. 

Still havent talked to nick or leanne. I wish them the best but otherwise they are dead to me. Otherwise not much to report, rent went up on the place krista and i have but thats life in calgary i guess. 

Xmas is comming soon and once again i dont care, Its not that i dont like xmas but its just more stress and headache. But as always ill get more into the spirit of xmas when it truly comes alive on boxing day ....gotta love those sales.

I wish i had a guitar here. I miss playing. 

Peace"

Work is going well. Im out of town alot and flying all over the country. The pager time sucks becase it really disturbs your life but the money gained from it makes it all worthwhile. I love my job and what i do and its been 7 months now. Quitting Air liquide and Coop was the best thing that has ever happend to me. 

Life at home is another matter. Things with krista are not well and this relationship is going to end. I shouldnt be suprized and im not really. Its just a matter of time. Shes not the person i fell for anymore and as a result i dont want to be part of this relationship now. Its become so negitive that i dont even want to be a part of it. I told her last night that things need to change and if they didnt i was gone. In reality i dont think they are going to change regardless of time and its only a matter of when it will end not if. 

Last night also marks an intresting addition to life. My friend cj is with this new woman named holly and is so happy. He and holly want to hook myself and her friend rochelle up and i met her for the first time last night. I dont know what it was about her but i havent stopped thinking about her. Its pretty bad when you have someone and your friends are telling you that you can move in with them and are trying to hook you up with someone else. Either that or its a sign. 

I guess i just need to make a choice."

One of the lines from what i consider to be one of the greatest songs ever. This week marks the begining of a new chapter in my life. You see myself and my gf have decided to share the habitrail and move in together. Its seems only fitting that since i began this journal at the end of my previous experiance of living with someone i should add into it the begining of the next. Funnny its almost three years since my last experament with this and as a result i feel it is only right that i should reflect on the past 3 years and see what i have accomplished since. 

One. I have fucked over 16 women in 3 years. This is only 5.333 per year but considering i know people that havent been with more then 1 person in 3 years this makes me quite the slut. Not that i care, im clean and i enjoyed each person i was with and would not change anything. 

Two. I bought a new car. Its pimp. I like it alot. 2003 grand am. Pimp. Nuff said.

Three. I have gone back to school. Im am currently half way through a buisness degree which i plan to finish asap. Hoping to continue in september we shall see

Four. I am still just as in debt as before :( But i can deal with that because i had to go into debt to pay off the first one. Now that it is paid i will be alot better off becuase i will be able to pay it finally. 

Five. I love my job. I finally got on with a company that treats me well and i feel very lucky to have had to opportunity. I can actually make a career out of it and that feels great. 

Im sure there is alot more but the important things have stayed the same. No babies lol. In any case i hope that i keep this journal going as i feel its a great way to keep track of my life. Anyhow my pager just went off, stupid assholes cant run a computer. 

Later

I ain't got regrets, i won't change a thing, and the man i am now is not the man i was then, as time goes by, i'll tell you my friend, Why ain't i bleeding"

To my former best friend and brother. Dont marry her, shes not right for you. I will probably never talk to you again after i move so good luck in life.

"event","Anyhow in time all things must be done and so to i must update. A fair bit to report but i need to make this rather quick so it will be more like the highlights of life over the past little while. Kristin's funeral was alright but the priest turned it into a recruitment session so i was less then impressed. I dont think that the funeral was in the spirit of her life at all but then again funerals are for the living not the dead. 

My ex finacee's old boss passed on the weekend i got back from kristin's funeral. I pretended to be upset for her sake but in actuality i have some pretty bitter feelings about that whole branch people on the tree of life so i thought it best i not attend her funeral. 

Work is going alright i guess. Im still working all alone and im rather tired of it. My boss is a fucking retard who should not be in the position he's in, and truly i think he is only in the job becuase he has been around 20+ years. I swear he could not organize/manage a good shit even with the help of fiber hightned diet and a german couple. Im going to start looking into other avenues before i get to deep into the bullshit and politics. Its a great company to work for but it need some serious re-working of the chain of operations.

Therefore over the inevitable

 -Bhagavad Gita 


Its taken a couple of days for me to decided to write about this and i still am unsure of what to write. I recived a phone call from my mother on monday afternoon that i am still reeling from and will be for some time. On august 29th a dear friend/former lover of mine was killed in a car accident. Her name is kristen and she and i were together on and off since i was in grade 8. The only reason we stayed friends after i moved is because she would not let our friendship die. Tonight im heading down to bc for the funeral and i am going to pay my last respects. My biggest regret is that she has left us to soon, and that she will be unable to see her young son grow up. A man should never have to bury his gf, even if she is no longer his, just as a parent should never have to bury a child. 

goodbye sweetie, i will love you always.

A bamboo grove,all chopped down.
From it, warring wings.

Evening folks long time no update. A fair bit to fill you in on so ill get right into it. My new job is still going fantastic and i enjoy it more each day. My boss has decided that i would be a good canidate to run our north location with my store management experiance so i have been transfered to that store and will be running it untill futher notice. Im feeling very good about this considering that i only started with them a month ago. The more time i spend working for this company the more i feel i made a good desision in leaving my previous job. Although there are times i miss co-op, not for the job but the people. 

Along with work has come a sudden increase in my pay scale. Now i had an idea of what to expect but you never really understand how much of a change it really makes untill you experiance it. Its weird to be once again ahead on my bills and to be able to enjoy life. Not to mention that the weekends off are an extreme enjoyment. Its nice to get off work at night and have work end. I dont get called at home for things and if i need to be off early for some reason i can just go. Another bonus is i already know the direction that i wish to head with the company and when i mentioned it they actually said what do you need to know to get there, just ask and we will show you. 

Life in the outside work respect has been awsome as well. Ive been playing alot of guitar these days, largely because i went and bought a new one, but ive actually gotten to the point where i can middle my way through a song or to. Now this isent a huge accomplishment by any means but its a sign to me that life is on the right track. Another thing that has happend is that i met someone. We have been seeing each other for about 3 weeks now and its going well. Things are nice and casual and i can actually be myself around her. Plus the fact that she has a good head on her shoulders is a bonus for sure. 

In all i would have to say life is good. Im actually happy again and this time its genuine and not a front. 

LAter for now. 

Chris"

I begin my new job tommorrow and i am scared, not because of the job, i know that im going to blow them away. Im more scared for how much my life will change because of it. Just going to a standard monday to friday schedlule is going to be a huge change. I will finally be able to plan for my life and not have to try to work it in around my job. This means that i can start hikeing on the weekends like i have wanted to, i can finally take more classes to finish my program at sait and most of all i can finally give the time to a relationship that i couldnt before. 

The money aspect is going to make a large change for me as well. The fact that i got a 7000 a year pay raise just to my base salary is going to make alot of change in my life. Ill finally be able to clear up my debt load and actually get ahead for once. It looks weird just reading that but its the truth i will actually be able to pay my bills and not be check to check now. 

My holidays were great and my father and i talked and he apoligized for being an asshole. He told me that he just worries about me and that he knows that i am makeing the right choice and that he is proud of me. This almost put me into tears. 

Now all i need to do is find that one person. And to be honest i think i have but i dont know how to tell her or if she feels the same way. I wish that i had some kind of sign that she wants to be with me. Oh well all things come in time and im sure the answer will as well.

Looking back on it i was being foolish by giving 3 weeks notice like i did. I dont know what i was thinking. Maybe it was the small sense of loyalty i felt to them still. In any case im done. It felt nice to leave and hear people telling me that they would miss me and that they were happy for me as they new how badly screwed over i was there. I was called by a few managers and they all told me best of luck and that i should have been givivn somthing more then i was. Its hard to belive that after 6 years i no longer have a set of keys to the buisness. Of course my dad was a dick about it and thinks i burned a bridge when i left, no matter what i say to him he dosent think i left on good terms. He just dosent understand but then again he never did understand me or my life. Nobody seems to."

When the president talks to God
Are the conversations brief or long?
Does he ask to rape our women's' rights
And send poor farm kids off to die?
Does God suggest an oil hike
When the president talks to God?

When the president talks to God
Are the consonants all hard or soft?
Is he resolute all down the line?
Is every issue black or white?
Does what God say ever change his mind
When the president talks to God?

When the president talks to God
Does he fake that drawl or merely nod?
Agree which convicts should be killed?
Where prisons should be built and filled?
Which voter fraud must be concealed
When the president talks to God?

When the president talks to God
I wonder which one plays the better cop
We should find some jobs. the ghetto's broke
No, they're lazy, George, I say we don't
Just give 'em more liquor stores and dirty coke
That's what God recommends

When the president talks to God
Do they drink near beer and go play golf
While they pick which countries to invade
Which Muslim souls still can be saved?
I guess god just calls a spade a spade
When the president talks to God

When the president talks to God
Does he ever think that maybe he's not?
That that voice is just inside his head
When he kneels next to the presidential bed
Does he ever smell his own bullshit
When the president talks to God?

I doubt it

"event","Sent to me over Msn Today:

""I just wanted to say that it has been a pleasure to be your friend and while I had wished it could last, I know that it just isn't.  Relationships are exciting things that require two people to actually be involved.  I can say without hesitation that we are not really involved.  You seeminly put me on the outside and that's fine - but I wish you could have told me.  It had been really hard to see you transition from talking to me everynight to never being there to share in those great moments.  I guess what I am trying to say is that relationships are funny things.

There are those that open you up to something new and exotic.  Those that are old and familiar
Those that bring up lots of questions.  Those that bring you somewhere unexcepted.

Those that bring you far from where you started. 

And there are those that end
I want to thank you for the summer and everything that you did.  You were so needed and I love you for everything that you have done.

You have once been a good friend to me.  And it is unfair that I continue to beleive that you will suddenly, magically be that friend again.""

Now i will admit that i did put this person on the back burner but not without my reasons. But at no time was i not willing to be there for her. Yes it does take two people to maintain a friendship and i did stop calling everynight, she found a bf and i didnt want to seem as though i was trying to move in on someone elses women (although i would have loved to cuz she is amazing). But the fact remains that she could have called me as well as its not like my main numbers have changed. 

If she has decided to end our friendship then so be it. That is not the desision i would have made and although she may not have thought so i do value our friendship. I cant help it if our schedules did not match up and that my work schdule has been changed drasticly from what it was. Its not just her who i dont see. I have 2 roomates that i can go 4 days at a time without seeing and we live together. And my gf i havent seen in a week now because things are so hectic. 

Now im not saying that its not my fault as yes i could have put out more effort as i think everyone could. But that works both ways. I always though that a true friendship didnt have to have a begining or an ending just the knowlage that even if you didnt talk to someone for months you could still call them and that they would still care about you. I guess perseption is diffrent for everyone."

"event","well hello again and welcome to another installment of crap from my ever running mind. I guess the more intresting things are that i have once again broken my vow of not just screwing random women as there have been another 3 this past month. My friends think its quite cool and think i should contiune this trend for as long as i can. I am of the other opinion. I dont want to keep doing this but somtimes its just to pornorific to pass up, i mean who in there right mind would pass up an offer of getting drunk and laid in a hottub. In any case i have decided that i need to curtail this behavior so i will once again attempt to go a month without getting laid. I figure the month is the turning point so that is my goal....unless something really freaking amazing presents itself... then its on. I also have found out that if i attempt a relationship with anyone then i need to ensure that i dont screw them within the first 12 hours of meeting. I find that if i do this then they automaticly become in the words of metal gear ""just a box"". I think thats one of the reasons why everyone since i met since jenn has just been a fuck buddy. So far the trend i see is if im intrested in the woman and i dont sleep with her the first 3 weeks then things tend to progress to more of a relationship standpoint and i actually begin to care for them. This will be a great test as i have met 4 wonderfull women in the past could of weeks online and things are now to the point were we being meeting each other face to face. There is one in particular named miranda who i am rather intrested in. For some reason she has definatly peaked my intrest in a very good fashion. She suprized me today and came past my work and we met for the first time. It was great and we are going to try to get toghter tommorrow night for coffee after shes off work and im done school. Here's hoping things work out. 

I guess the next biggest thing is i bought a bowflex and i have actually stuck to my plan of useing it. Its quite an amazing piece of machine and i would be lying if i said it didnt kick my ass the first few days. Its gotten much better now and im really begining to enjoy the burn im getting from it. I want to lose alot of this weight by summer as well as build up my muscles. I can already feel my arms getting a little bigger from it and my abs feel alot stronger although they dont show it yet... but they will:)

School is going well although i find the class very boring. I think that its because of the teacher i have becuase honestly this chick shoudl take her own advice. The other night were sitting in class and shes telling us when making presentations its important to monitor the audiance reactions and adjsut your presentations accordingly, Meanwhile half the class has left and the rest of us are slowly falling asleep. Maybe she should have listen to what she was teaching. I cant wait till this class is done and im back into more intresting classes. 

Work is hectic and kind of a pain in the ass. But not much i can do other then stick it out for now. IM looking at other jobs right now but im not taking anything seriously untill i know what happens with the bursaries i applied for through work. 2000 bucks will pay for alot more school and that is fine by me. 

Anyhow i need to get up at 4 in the moring so ill catch you later"

"event","Well its been about a month since i have updated this so i figure that i should at least take some time to do so. Im currently just at the begining of 2 weeks holidays and thus far it has been great. I have managed to finish putting away all of the boxes and crap in the new place, went out for my buddies birthday and just genrally relaxed. The move out of the old place went really well and im getting as good portion of my damage back so im pleased. I was talking to melissa about it at pauls party and she offerd to pay me any of the diffrence that i didnt get back. I told her no becuase she haddent lived there in 2 years and that it was fine. I also spent some time talking to her new bf peter. Hes a really nice guy and everyone was shocked that he and i were sitting there bullshitting. They invited me to there superbowl party this weekend and i may go but i havent decided. In any case its nice to be back in the social swing of things again. I saw alot of my old friends at pauls party and it was weird. I never knew how many people missed me but my phone got stolen and when i eventually got it back that night there were a whole bunch of new numbers in it. Needless to say i have a few phonecalls to make. I finally went to my public relations class after missing the first 2 weeks. It was pretty good and i seem to have a natural feel for the matirial or at least thats what my teacher says. 

So my friends are all trying to hook me up with a woman named erin. I am not unopposed to the idea so im going to see where things go as i am throughly tired of what i have been doing up untill this point. This month alone i have fucked 3 diffrent woman and while the fact that in some small male way that is impressive, i find that in the bigger picture i am totally unfullfilled by this. I have come to the conclusion that im not going to put out anymore becuase it seems like when im seeing someone and things get psyical the next day all they want is a fuck buddy and nothing more. Not that its that bad of a situation becuase i can get some at anytime i wish but when your not looking for just a fuck it is very unfullfilling outherwise. But i went and got checked out the other day and have a clean bill of health so now that im at that point im not going to sleep with anyone else untill i see where things go with erin or for that matter anyone else. 

Work is good, myself and tony are about to begin a manual that will completely change the how the training is handled at the gas bars. When its done it will just be another addition to my otherwise impressive file, but for now it will keep me occupied becuase really thats what chris needs. Anyhow im going to end off here as its time to go do my daily workout and then crack the homework being as i have 10 chapters to read by tommrrow. 

later"

"event","Good evening and welcome back to the show. Going to be a short update tonight but a good one. I found out jsut who fucked me over for the mangers position and im not suprized at who or why. Needless to say it has givin me more motivation to beat this and get the job next time, mostly for the big fuck you it will be to them when i do. School is almost done, i have 1 more exam monday and then im finished for this term. I still dont know if i am going back next term but heres hoping. Xmas is getting closer although i could really give a shit anymore. IM looking forward to all the new found overtime i have picked up. Overtime = Bling Bling for chris and really who dosent enjoy a little more bling now and again. Trish and i still talk all the time but the enjoyment is not there for me anymore. 

Went over to my buddy cjs house last night. Drank 3 bottles of wine and had a great time. Were going to be getting together on the 23rd as well for some more wine and a good guitar session. Im very much looking forward to it. I need to hang out with him more. 

Got a very suprizing phone call tonight from katie. Seems her and clayton are having trouble and so she called to talk (see jenn your not the only one who does it). It was nice to talk to her even though the subject matter was not the best. I Hope things work out for her and him becuase she really loves him although to be honest is part of me wishes it was me with her and not him. But like everything in life it will happen if it is supposed to be so i guess i just need to wait. 

Melissa and i are going out on monday after my exam for coffee. It should be a good time and im glad were really starting to build on this friendship we have started. 

Other then that not much else to report. Life is pretty uneventfull otherwise. I may send katie the address to this journal so she can add her 2 cents in here, Could make for some intresting reading anyhow."

"event","Well to add to the fun week i have had i figured out last night that i cannot go home for xmas. Becuase i did my job and fired the one guy this week it has totally fucked me from being able to take any time off to go home for xmas. After looking at the schedule the only way i can keep my store running witout major problems is to cancel my holidays and cover the shortage myself. So lets recap, in one week i fired a good friend, lost my gf and now cannot take the holidays i have been looking forward to for over 4 months. The pity offers have started to come in from people asking me to spend xmas with them now. I have turned them all down becuase really if i dont have my own xmas i really dont want to sit on the outside and watch someone else's. 

Only 3 more weeks till this fucking year is over."

"event","Well here we go again, Once i again i meet an amazing woman, have an instant connection with her, we get along great and everything seems right. Then just like ususal 2 weeks into it she relaizes that shes not ready for a relationship and i get the standard ""your an amazing guy and i want to stay friends and evertually i do want to be with you but right now its not the right time for me"" speech. Ladies hear me now if you are not ready for a relationship with someone then dont show intrest in someone and start one. All it does is fuck them up afterward when you end it 2 weeks later because your not over the first guy. When your with someone for a a few years you very rarely can just move on a few months later. Take the time to sort out yourself before you try and move on because all you do is set someone else back otherwise. I am truly tired of being the rebound guy but it seems like everytime i meet someone thats all that happens. I guess what confuses me the most is ive been told im exactly what they need, want and are looking for. But if that were true why am i single now and why when they are ready to be with someone does it seem like they always go for the guy who treats them like shit in the end. I guess im screwed becuase i will never be able to be that kind of boyfriend, husband for anyone. I have to much respect for my partners for that. 

a tout le monde, a tout les amis, je vous aime, je dois partir

"event","Lots to write about today as its been about 2 weeks since i have put down my thoughts so here goes nothing. Might as well start with last monday when i recived a call from melissa (ex fiancee). It seems she got tired of waiting for me to call her about going for coffee so she dedided to call me. At first i was really apprihensive about meeting her and wasent sure if i was going to go or not. Well after talking to a very smart lady i know i decided to go for it. And man am i glad i did becuase i finally got alot of the answers ive been searching for. We talked for about 3 hours and nothing was off limits. We talked about our lives since weve been together, how we feel about each other, how we were dealing with things and most importantly we both got closure and actually started building the foundation of a friendhip that we both feel is long overdue in its inseption. For me it was like a giant weight had been lifted from my back because i finally relaized that i am not the rock in the middle of the river that people use to cross and leave behind. That for me was the biggest question that i had about myself and she was able to answer it for me. There is still alot of work to go in building a frinedship but were on the right path and thats the thing that counts. I found out that she was still dealing with the same demons as i was inside and you could see that she got as much out of this as i did. I hope this helped her to finally get some closure as well so that her and peter can have an honest chance together. I know i have ripped on her alot and i told her so, she had done the same things, but the truth is that she really is an amazing person and it just turned out that our paths in life were not the same. I dont regret anything that happend and if i was ever made to live it again i would do so in a heartbeat becuase it changed me so much as a person. Now by no means did i get all the answers i have been looking for but if we as humans had all the answers it would make life pretty boring, but i did get the ones that i needed to find the strenght to pull down the walls i had been trying so hard to build. their not all gone and it'll be along time before that happens but they have come down far enough that i can see the other side and can see whats waiting and to me thats the biggest victory. 

On wednsday at work i was told that i will not be gettign interviewd for the managers position. Im dissapointed but i wasent suprized. There reasons for it were as follows:

- i have no tolareance for incompatance. If i have to go over something simple with someone more then 3 times i get extremely frustrated with them. Not this is not nessesarilly a bad trait for a manager to have but i still need to extend the amount of patiance i have and even i agree with this statment. It was said that not everyone learns like is do an that i am actually the exception in this case as i tend to not only learn things the first time i am shown but 9 times out of 10 i have figured it out before i am shown and have already found a better way to do it. 

- When im right and i know im right and i can prove it i will not deviat from that thought. This results in me telling my bosses in no uncertain terms to pull there heads out of there asses and get a clue. Now with my current manager this is alright to do becuase her and i have an amazing working relationship and we can do this to each other. My problem is i tend to tell her boss this when hes wrong (in more professonal ways) and when he still dosent clue in i make it my job to not only let his boss know but i make him look stupid in the process. This is somthing i need to work on and am planning to do so. Next time he can just look stupid on his own without my help...he sure dosent need it. moron.

- The last thing that thay said is that i am far to hard on myself. I hate to be beaten by somthing simple and i when i am i get extreamley frustrated and then i dont stop untill i have beaten the problem. They said i needed to learn to accept that i am not going to do eveything perfectly and that it is ok to make mistakes. I myself have real trouble with this as i cannot change this part of my personality.

In all if i work on these things and can show that i have shown imporvment in them (which they said in all relaity im not that far from in the first place) that in 6 months they would recomend me without question because im 98% ready now. Even though i was dissapointed with this outcome i know now what i need to work on and i have the tools to do so. I feel pretty good about it beucase i know how hard it is to get this far along in the prosses and if i only have to take 6 months to get there then im going to re-double my efforts. Not becuase i want the position that badly but becuase i cannot be beaten when i am this close (issue number 3 comming out strong).

The next thing that has happend is that i met someone. Her names is trish and we actually went to the same high school together although she was a year younger then me. We knew of each other but had never talked before. Anyhow she sent me an email online and told me a little about herself. I was intregued right then i must admit but then when relized that we knew some of the same people and had other things in common it just clicked. Ive been talking to her everynight for 4 and 5 hours at a time and she has come up to my work and seen me. Its so weird but it feels so right and im so happy. There is never a dull moment when i talk to her and when we have to get off the phone its always so hard to do so. We talk about everything and the more we talk the more we have in common. We think the same so much and i find that when we talk online were both typing the same thing at the same time. And when i look into her eyes i see somthing amazing....i dont know what it is yet but i cant wait to find out. Needless to say i can see myself falling for this woman and although it scares me i dont want to run away. Nick and i have talked about it and he dosent want to see me hurt myself again by running from somthing good. I coudnt really explain it to him but i know i wont do that this time. Anyhow i think this is a good time to leave off, I need to get some stuff done around the hut before i see trish tonight."

"event","So i have hit a point in my life where i am unsure what to do next. Life is pretty good in most aspects but it is completely lacking in others. Work is good, my homelife is great and for the most part i know alot of people who would love to be where i am in there own lives. My problem is that i am not. I am very unhappy and yet i have no reason to be. I am tired of getting up in the morning to do the same shit day in and day out. And its not like i dont know whats missing becuase i do know. 

I miss being with someone who i can talk to and spend some of this meaninless time with. I need that someone who makes this puzzle of a life come together for me. And yet at the same time im so unsure of myself that i dont think that i should be with anyone at this point right now anyhow. My self confidence has been so low in this regard for so long now that i dont think i even know how to be happy anymore. I keep looking for something that i honestly dont think ill ever find again, and even if i did find it i dont think i would be able to hang onto it anyhow. I keep building up walls between me and those who i care about while at the same time i refuse to let anyone past the ones that are already there. All i want is to die but im so scared of who i would hurt if i did that i cant bring myself to do it. And as much as i try to explain things to others they never really understand and i honestly dont think they could anyway. It wouldnt reallly make a diffrence if i wasent here, all thats left right now is a shell anyhow. 

I guess really that someone who im missing is me, but i think im the only one who is.

If there's any bitches in this room 
Then there's something I gotta say 
For all the fools who feel for verse 
Girl who comes and wait 
I've been down that road and now I'm back 
sitting on square one 
trying to pick myself up 
where I started from 

(Obie Trice) 
I never would of thought that I'de see you outta control 
even though my penis was deep down in your hole 
You should know between us we was like mates and soul 
nothing could intervine us especially no hoes 
you was more so da shalon<- (??) type but chose to more shows 
haunted you nights I supposed thats how it goes 
with time spent, emotion grows 
in the beginning friends, we decided to roll 
so whos responsible when you get excited explode 
and Obis grinning leave you in vite<-(??) that obies cold 
but bitches they gone talk niggas they gone hate 
we established this way before we became mates 
so whats the quiettist that you chilled with all that fire 
get you desire when I retire 

Chorus 1x 

Spend some time with me 
Spend a little bit

I never thought I'de find, someone to be mine 
Lord knows I was right, cause you just crossed the line 

Spend some time with me 
Spend a little bit 

(Eminem) 
I used to say I never met a girl like you before 
Still aint got a fuckin clue is to who you truly are 
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters 
Till you went as far as going and snoopin through my drawers 
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you throw me for 
Cant believe I almost flew to couver for some stupid whore 
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours 
All I ever wanted from you is a few booty calls 
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad 
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewerly off 
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off 
It was a shock it struck me as I But it turned me on 
You started getting moody on me pretty soon we part 
Even the ruder you got the more beautiful you got to me 
And who even knew that who would had even thought possibily you 
because you shoot another one of them god damn darts at me 
Its true that I got shot in the heart 
but when someone seems too good to be true they usually are 
But see, when you're in it its too hard to see 
till you pull up and see some other dudes car parked and reach 
up under the seat as your heart starts to beat 
before you make a decision its life altering 
and just as you hall and you turn and you start to leave 
you hear them words echoeing almost haunting that taunting ring 

Chorus 1x 

(Stat Quo) 
(yea right bitch, spend time with my dick) 
In most cases, stats out to tomb to fuck a bitch 
My only motiv is to get head and fuck a bitch 
but you was different, thought we shared a cuvanent<-(??) 
even held your hand in public 
we suffering because of this 
shot down some hoe anotha other shit 
trying to play sick thought ima a tricked off rip 
Ill admit i was caught in the mix, down to commit 
feeding you the best of me, I shoulda fed you to pigs 
we started off close and close 
but who could of perdicted to know 
your tried for the ways would of stopped I grow 
and the final result, back in that same boat 
I ask my self, do I love these hoes? Nopee!

"event","Hello hello and welcome to another update. Im not stoned this time and im rather happy about that. As much as i enjoyed my slide backwards into who i was 4 years ago it is once again time to come back to reality and face life such as it is. I find every once in a while its nice to let go and drift away from life but when you come down the world is still there and you still have to face it. I think tonight would be a good night to lay everything out on the line as i have to be awake at 4:30 am for work and its already 12:45.. so at this point sleep is something i will not be doing i think. 

I am not happy with my work. My work is enjoyable enough and im good at what i do but when it boils down to it i am not stimulated mentaly enough to continue with them in a life long capacity. I dont think i get paid well enough for what i do and i want more money. So i am going elsewhere to try to find the stimulation i need. So far i have applied at a number of diffrent places and will be continuing to do so untill my needs are met. 

My love life doesent full fill me. I have a number of options open in this avenue right now but i do not find any of my current prospects worth the effort. Not one of them has created any stimulation mentally at all for me in the past 2 months. 2 of them i have decided are only worth putting any effort into because they amuse me and even then the effort i put in is minimal. The most full filling part of my love life right now is trying to figure out how to date my cashier at work, but the problem is her and i have been friends so long that it may be not worth the risk to see what may be there. 

I have also come to the conclusion that things with me and a certain someone need to have a resolution. There needs to be a defining point where i either tell her how i truly feel and hope that she feels the same or i dont and i let it go. But i can no longer go on kicking myself over what might have been, or second guessing what may be. Either shes scared to tell me how she feels because she dosent know herself or shes just playing with my heart for kicks. I really dont think its the latter becase she's just not that cruel. 

My sex life bores me. Ive been with 2 diffrent women this past week and both times i would rather have been reading a magazine or sleeping. I go through the motions becuase i have nothing better to do and it offers a small amount of stimulation if only for a few hours. 

The only thing that i am finding any enjoyment in these days is school. Other then that i have nothing that keeps me fullfilled. My days are empty and without meaning and i am tired of it. I long for the days when i will either find that someone who makes them worth being concious for becuase i know shes out there, ive met her twice now and both times i let her go, and both times i regret, or i long for the endless sleep that i know will come someday, because if this is all there is to life then its quite the letdown. 

I think there comes a time in everyones life when you finally know what it is that will make you truly happy. For me its the never ending hope that i will someday find my place in this world and not feel so alone. That i will once again find that person who loves, understands and wants me for who i am. Twice i have found this feeling with someone, this aura around them , the look in there eyes and sound in there voice. The feel of their touch on my skin. The way that whenever i was in their arms i felt nothing but free and loved. 

Katie, im sorry i ever left you. You were the first love of my life and to this day i still miss you. Not a day goes by that i dont think about you. I hope that someday you find the happiness that you deserve. I am truly lucky to have been with you. Thank you for all you have taught me. 

Melissa, Im sorry for never truly loving you. I tried to and for awhile i thought i truly did, but i was lying to myself and to you. You are an amazing woman and you have a kind heart, Thank you for letting me have a place in it. I only wish i could have let you into mine the same way. 

Jenn, although i was with you only a short time i was happier with you then i had been in along time. You may not have thought you were something special but your wrong. You amazed, intrigued and made me feel special (and not in a ""have you seen my baseball"" kind of way either). I wish i hadnt gotten scared, If i had not maybe someday i would have been the guy on the porch when you got home. Whoever your with is a lucky man, hopefully there not to blind to see it like so many of us are.   


The war is on, too weak to move 
Call it off, sorry refused 
So we bend the bracket 
Shove it down anything to make it fit 

Maybe, finally, i can leave some of my past behind me."

"event","Well i figure its about time i post another update. Not to much has happend in the last little while. Ive been really busy with school and when im not at school or working on my homework im at work. Not to much has really been happening otherwise. One new development it that im looking for a new job. I came to the conclusion that i need something more challanging then anything i can get with coop. Even if i were to accept the managers position it would still be the same shit im doing now except more meetings to attend and i just dont feel theres enough of a challange for me involved there. Ive also decided i want something that centers around my diploma and since im not in a rush to find a new job im being very specific with what im applying on. Thats why ive only applied for 10 places so far. My parents arent very happy with this turn of events as they think i should stay with coop and work my way up. They just dont understand my thoughts and why i need the challange. Hell my dad worked for the same company all his life and so has mom. I have to admit im kinda nervous about it ive been with coop almost 6 years and ive got it really good there. But at the same time im bored as hell and no amount of small projects can keep me intrested. I talked to jenn the other day which was nice. I miss her alot and unfortuatly i have really let things slide between us as friends. I guess its because i cant stop thinking about what might have been. Man i should have told her how i felt/feel but im just scared becuse i dont know if she felt/feels the same way as i do. I wish i knew. Anyhow i gotta get a move on as i have to be at work in a half hour. Happy thanksgiving."

I do remember alot of puking being done by yours truly. This is the result of the mass quantity of booze that was consumed by myself. I do remember talking to melissa last night although i dont remember what we talked about or how her phone number ended up on my bedside table this morning. I also remember amy straddleing my leg at one point and us holding each other but once again no other details to add to this. I remember seeing allison for the first time in months and haveing a great conversation by the golf machine...about what i dont remember....although she did look exceptonally good. I will write more once someone fills me in."

"event","So its been awhile since ive added anything to this so once again here we go. School is going great and each class i go to just makes it that much more concrete that i have made the correct choice. Not to mention that this week begain the not so subtle push of chris towards a mangers positon has been upped in its intensity this past week. So far i have been given a 3000 page ""Every managers desk referance"" from my boss and her boss because they feel its something im going to get alot of use out of soon. There was also a copy of the one minute manger sitting in my box 2 days later that was taken out for me by my boss. Ive have also been introuduced to a number of high profile people in the past little while who under normal circumstance would not really have anything to do with me , but they have all told me that they have heard alot about me and they look forward to working with me soon. What is scary though is i no longer feel like i dont deserve this, yes thats right chris has finally figured out somthing and that is i am dam good at what i do and i deserve more responsibilty and all the praise i get. This to me is a total brekathrough.....i have self esteem now. Now by no means is this a large breakthrough but a person has to start somewhere. 

I have been so busy these days that if i had another 7 hours in the day i dont think it would be enough time. My mondays are esspecially brutal becuse im on the go from 4:30am till 11pm only to be off and running at 4:30 am again. Thank god for caffine and pepsi because without them i think i would become a zombie otherwise. 

My 24th brithday is this friday. So far my weekend is so busy. Friday i work from 5:30am till 2:30pm then i come home and finish my homework before i go see stabilo play at sait. Then i have to be back at sait the next morning at 9 for class untill 12. From class my term project group are going to the buissness that were doing the marketing plan for  and were going to start putting the first part of the project together. Then i come home and get changed because a whole bunch of us are going to the point and feather in ranchlands to celebrate my birthday. So far about 20 people are going to show and counting. Then sunday is more homework from saturdays class and were back to the monday routine. PLus my boss is gone so i have her job and my own to do so this week im going to be working about 50 hrs. Not only do we have our sales to track now but were doing the liquor stores as well and im the only one who knows how to do it correctly. Busy busy busy. But hey ill sleep when im dead. 

Nothing really that new on the love life front. I met a girl named melissa (scary isent it) and im not very intrested in her. She dosent seem to have what im looking for and there was really no clicking what so ever. But this isent a bad thing beacause i really dont have the time for someone right now anyway. Things in my life have shifted into overdrive and show no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Maybe when i go home at xmas things will be calmer but somehow i dont think so. 

Anyhow i gotta get moving. Have to be at sait by 5 and i have a few errands to run before hand. 

Later"

"event","I saw jenn last night, and once again i have achived whatever it is that my subconcious mind wants because i did push her away. I hope shes happy with him and that he treats her well because she is an amazing person. 

At this point it seems that fate has decided to keep me alone and to my own devices, to which end i am unsure of. I hope something changes soon as i am begining to lose faith in ever finding someone. 

Another thing that has been brought up is that i am to hard on myself and untill i learn to love myself i cannot really love anyone. Now if i take all of this into consideration, i come to the conclusion that this may be the hint to re-evaluate myself as a person and answer the question that i have been asked on a number of occasions. 

Why are you so hard on yourself?

My answer is becuase i know that im nothing. And no matter how i try to change things and no matter what i do to better myself as a person i will never love myself because i dont feel that who i am is worth loveing and i never will. I will alway be the person behind the scene's and thats where i want to be. If nobody knows your there you cant get hurt and you cant hurt anyone in return. 

The last thing i want to do is hurt anyone, life is to short to fill it with pain and sadness but it seems that no matter how hard i try i always end up hurting those who i care about the most. 

Its time to shift my focus from finding someone to finding myself. Its been far to long since ive known who i am as a person and its a reunion that is far overdue. Becuase i think that only after i know myself will i be ready to drop my walls and let someone else know me as well.

Anyhow i also bought a new laptop computer this week. I should recive it by ups by the end of this week or next. Im really excited about it becuase ive wanted a laptop for some time and this one has everything i was looking for in it. 

Work is going good. Not to much to say there. I like my staff and even my new customers have been great. 

Mom and dad came into town this past weekend. It was nice seeing them and we had a good visit. I miss them alot and i dont see them as much as i would like. Esspecially now that dads knees are so much worse. We went to market mall on monday and we had to get dad a wheelchair so that he could make it through the mall. I have to say that it almost broke me to see him in so much pain. Hopefully once he gets the other knee replaced it will change things for the better. 

they also made me an open ended offer which shocked the hell out of me. We got talking about how i want to buy my own place in the next 2 years and they said that once i found the place i wanted to build and where that they would give me the down payment for it. Needless to say im really looking at places right now with a whole diffrent outlook becuase i know that if i really want to i can buy one now. 

Oh and im going to the coors light trauma tour in sylvan lake this saturday. Should be a good time.

"event","Now in these cynical times 
Sterotypical minds 
Got me falling from my pinnacle the minute I climb 
Now these subliminal thoughts got individuals blind 
I'm trying to look beyond the lies 
Just to see what I'll find 
I'm like a flower in a cave 
Another hour in the maze 
And I'll cower to the power of my criminal ways 
The sun is shining but I'm catching minimal rays 
It's time for me to grow out of this childish phase 
My life is like a battle that I'll probably never win 
'Cause I keep thinking big and risking everything 
Life's a challenge and I wonder if I'll ever find the balance 
Mixed emotions and confusion topped off with many talents 

Chorus: 
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever change 
Can I change 
Would I change 
Or am I always gonna be the same 
I blame the world for making me such a freak 
But the world wants to blame it on me 
(my life is twisted) 

My finger's pointing in the mirror 
I'm the one now 
I see my shadow in the sun dial 
Am I really out of change 
Put my freedom in a cage 
Slow down 
Man I got a son now 
There's nothing new thay all said it 
And I know it but I had to go throught it myself 
I'm hard-headed 
That's the only way I'll learn 
Get caught in the fire ther's no escaping the burn 
And it burns 
Change this 
Change that 
Change is full of lies 
I remain the same cat wear a good disquise 
Living life loking through my third blind crooked eye 
So if I change I'd be changing for the worst wouldn't I? 

Chorus: 
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever change 
Can I change 
Would I change 
Or am I always gonna be the same 
I blame the world for making me such a freak 
But the world wants to blame it on me 
(my life is twisted) 

I wanna run but if I run I'm only running from myself 
Would it be easier if I were someone else 
I'm like a child playin' with matches that's never beeen burned 
Relearning all the lessons that I've already learned 
On a highway to a destinatin I've earned 
So many exits, but I've never bothered to turn 
I'm like a piece of shard glass laying on a frame of a window 
That was broken by the bricks of pain 
Sometimes I feel just like the devil's guinea pig 
He's watching me just to see how deep I can dig 
I admit I'm fucked up and got a lot to learn 
So now I'm dancing in the ashes of the bridge I've burned 

Chorus: 
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever change 
Can I change 
Would I change 
Or am I always gonna be the same 
I blame the world for making me such a freak 
But the world wants to blame it on me 
(my life is twisted)

Fitting song i think."

"event","So the last week has been intresting as hell. Being a manager is alot of work but very full-filling. In any case i am rather drunk right now so this post could be intresting. today i had the board of directors out for a site inspection. It was fun and i was suprized to see just how far up my reputation has gone. When the c.e.o. of the company comes up and knows you by your full name its a pretty good feeling, not to mention the VP's of cid and operations also know you and make it a point to make sure they see you while there on site. I guess the most suprising thing to me is the fact that some of the board knew who i was and wanted to meet me as well. Im beinging to think that maybe my friends are right and this is the companys way of pushing me towards a managers position, the problem is i dont know if i want one. 

So i havent heard from jenn at all and in honesty i dont think i will. Im pretty sure that i ruined anything we had, but thats the way it goes i guess. Although i would be lying if i said that i didnt miss talking to her. I find myself looking at the phone each time it rings hopeing it will play stairway to heaven so i can hear her voice. Man i am such a fool for letting her go. But whats done is done and i cant change it so i have to push on and see what doors open for me now. To be honest i really dont think i want be with anyone right now. If this whole thing has taught me anything its that i am never going to be happy in any relationship and that i should concentrate on work and school instead of any kind of romantic endevor. Although if i had the chance i would fight my damndest to make things work between her and i. I just wish i would have told her that. 

So in closing i want to say to jenn that i wish her the best and good luck. The man she chooses to be with is very lucky and i only wish it was me as she truly was one of a kind. My own stupidity has once again cost me somthing great."

"event","Well once again i have pushed away someone who i truly cared for. In my Inifnate stupididty which at this point seems to have no bounds i have pushed away the one person who made me feel happy again. Yes i know im ususally a very happy person and for the most part i will agree with those who say that. But the happiness i speak of is not the normal everyday happiness that everyone has. What i am talking about is the kind of happiness that makes you feel almost electrified. It makes your heart race and your pulse quicken. It makes you muddle your words when you talk and your thoughts when your silent. It makes you laugh when theres no need to and above all else it makes you feel like nothing in the world could stand in your way. 

I was seeing the most wonderfull women i have ever met and truth be told i was begining to fall for her. She really is an awsome person and i wish i would have told her how i was feeling. I would have done anything she asked and she knew that. The thing that made me care for her though was the fact that she never did. She never once made me feel like i was just and errand boy or a servant like so many others have and it felt really really good. And for the first time ever it really felt like she just wanted me for who i was. Not for my car or my money but she truly liked me for me. Because of that i would have done anything for her. 

She made me laugh, smile and run through a million diffrent emotions that i never new i had. Not to mention the fact that she wouldnt bullshit about anything. With her it was straight to the point and it is such a nice change to find someone like that. 

She really is the one who i want to be with, More then anything i wish i could hold her and truly tell her how im feeling becuase it would clear up so much. Maybe even save what we may have had. In any case i do hope i get to hear from her again becuse i want to tell her how i feel to her face.

I owe her that much."

"event","Have you ever had something happen to you that totally changes your perspective on life but you dont know how it changed it you just know that it did. Thats what i had happen over the past few nights. 

The first thing happend while over at nicks for dinner with him and leanne. I never said anything but watching the two of them together and the way they were so honest and open with each other really made me think about what it was that im missing in my life. I really miss that kind of companionship and in truth i havent had that in years at least not in a relationship anyhow. The way they looked at one another really made me see just how in love they really are and in all honesty made me a little sad becuase i miss the feeling of being able to look into someones eyes and be able so say so much without making a sound. We talked about our futures and having our kids grow up together and it hit me on the way home that everything we talked about may never happen because i cant be happy in a realationship no matter how hard i try. I know why i cant be happy, its because i wont let all my walls down unless i feel that feeling again. When i can look into someones eyes and see my future with them ill know that shes the one. 

The realization has also hit me that jenn and i no matter how much of an attraction there is between us will not work. Shes intlligent, beautifull, funny and all around everything i could ever want in a partner. I get tounge tied when im around her and nervous with all kinds of good butterflys in my stomach. The thing is i know im not good enough for her. We come from two very diffrent backgrounds and unfortunatly i will never fit into her world and i know that if i tried i would just be someone im not and that would not be fair to her. Shes going to have an amazing career and future and i dont doubt that someday youll see her on the front page of the newspaper becuase shes done something that blows peoples minds, where as i will be happy If im doing something i love and have the same friends then as i do today. Im a very simple person where as shes very complex, but its that complexity about her that i like more and more each day. I have never met anyone like her and i feel like my life has become enriched just by the 2 months ive known her. I care about her because of who she is not because of what she can do for me. 

Shes always worried about hurting me and I tell her not to worry because in truth i hurt myself enough for the both of us and then i hide the wounds in the darkness of my mind.

Now before you get all freaked on me i shall explain this one in further detail for you fellow readers. The reasons for this are as follows 1. she is intllegent and makes me feel like i am capable of anything if i put my mind to it. 2. she intrests me in so many ways. i have never met a woman with so much depth before and it just makes me want to improve myself so i can become more complete. 3. She understands me on a level that nobody ever has. I can ramble on in a sentance that would make sence to nobody else but me and she still understands what im talking about. 4. she feels right. I dont know how else to explain it but she just feels right. even though we are as diffrent as we are she still feels right. 

there are alot more reasons but right now i cant really get into them as im not in the best state of mind. Suffice it to say that i wish i could tell her how i feel but im scared that im going to screw things up. She wants to just be friends for now and i will respect that. But to be truthfull i can see this being serious for along time and to be honest i hope she feels the same way.

"event","well hello all and welcome to another additon to my journal (canned applause goes off). 

This past week has been very busy as we opened the store on friday. Buisness is begining to pick up and hopefully will continue along this trend. Ive been opening the store everyday since weve opened and then i go back in at night to help teach the other guys to close. Needless to say im very tired but i enjoy it as well. I guess i am turing into a bit of a workahilic but hey thats not a bad thing. The only downside besides the lack of sleep is i havent been able to see/talk to jenn as much. I miss her and the hours long conversations we had at night. She suprized me the other night and came up to see me and introduce me to her friend candice. Candice is really nice and i can see why jenn is friends with her as shes very outgoing and friendly. It was really nice to see jenn though even if it was just for 15 minutes. I ended up going down there last night to help her set up her digital camera before i went back into work and to be honest i didnt want to leave. I really need to make it up to her because i know that i dont call her nearly as much as i use to. I sure did not want to let her go when i hugged her last night though because i really liked holding her. Shes feels so right if that makes sense at all. 

Anyhow before i get all sappy and crap im going to cut off here.

Lots of setup work and cleaing today but we got 3/4 of the stuff we can do finished. We would have gotten more done but some of the shelves are not fully assembled because were waiting for replacement parts. But in all a very fullfilling day. The only casualty was my cell phone. The piece of shit died on me and rather then trying to mess with it i went and bought a new one. 

Life is pretty good, Graham moves in this month and he leanne and i are quite excited about it. It should be a good time for all.

"event","Time for the monthly update on my life. I really need to make more of an effort with this then i have been. Anyhow life has been going well i guess. My new store opens on the 29th and i am comming off a weeks holidays fresh and recharged for the months of stress ahead. Im actually looking forward to the challanges its going to bring because i need somthing a little more faster paced than the past store. Not that there was anything wrong with brentwood but after 2 years the store was to the point where it would run itself. Hopefully that trend will continue long after myself and deb have left although i have my doubts. 

Ive been seeing a woman named jenn for about 4 weeks now. Shes very smart and beautifull and i enjoy her company very much. She makes me smile which is a nice change for me. Some people thought i had forgotten how (myself included). Right now were working on our friendship as she is recently out of a serious relationship and dosent need anything more then a friend right now which is perfectly fine with me. I dont think im as ready for a serious relationship as i thought i was anyway so we've hit a happy medium. Shes the first person that when i muddle what im trying to say and it comes out backawards still understands the point im trying to make. And even though i know she is smarter then i am i dont feel dumb around her. I can see her becomeing one of my best friends even if things dont work out romanticly and thats a really nice feeling to have. Not to mention she makes me laugh.

Ive also re-enrolled in school for september. Im truly excited about going back for this next term. I think a large part of that is im able to appriciate it now that ive matured more and grown more as a person. 

My cousin reagans wedding is this weekend. I opted out of going as im not very close to her. But at the same time i do wish her the best and hope things work out well for her. Ive been asked by alot of people why im not going and ive been rather reserved about it. Ive told them its because of work but in reality its becaue im closer to some of my co-workers then i am to that side of the family and have no real intrest in attending. Thanks for the invite but as i said at graduation to little to late. You should have taken an intrest in my life before now instead of treating me like i didnt exist all these years. 

thats about it tonight. Maybe more tommorrow."

"event","Isent it amazing when shit finally becomes clear to you that your life can take such an amazing turn for the better. To explain this will need to start at the begining of my holidays with nick. He and i fucked off with our friend cj to my cabin in b.c. for about a week after the last post was added into my journal here. It was a good time had by all.We did some quading, squirrel hunting and drinking and just realxed and forgot about the real world for a week. At the end of the time we decided to go into my home town for a couple of days to see some people and do some laundry before we came back here. Well on the way into kimberley i called katie and left a message that we were coming into town. When we got to my parents place her bf clayton called and we set up a coffee date for the evening. Well we went out and a good time was had by all. Nick got a new appriciation for her and for the first time someone actually understood why i was so hung up on her. Needless to say we proceeded to go to the bar and he got me drunk as we discussed her and we finally came to the conclusion that it wasent her that i was in love with but the model number she was. I shall explaine this in more detail. See we have come to the conclusion that women come in diffrent states of completion and will become upgraded with time. The base model the f-1000 is you basic money grubbing slut (see ex-fiancee melissa) that has no inteligence at all. they are the cheapest and most abused model number as they are plentyfull and can be easily obtained by white trash (see peter). The f-1000 can be mistaken for a better model number buy dressing it up in nice clothes and a fresh coat of paint each day but alas this will only last as long as the software remains uncorupted, afterward the unit is usless and will only responed to currency and chocolate(see melissa's fat ass) and must be replaced. The next unit up the line in the f-3000 (see amy) this unit has better parts, better software and all around better operating software. Its major flaw is that it becomes attached to its owner to fast and trys to progress the emotonal aspect of the relationship faster then the psyical aspect and as you know you need to test the hardware before you commit to the purchase of the unit in a long term capacity. This unit will make someone very happy and is a good all round purchase for most people. It is loyal hard working and reliable. The pinicale of the female model is the f-5500 (see katie) this model is smart, beautifull and all around the total package. When one has a 5500 one does not forget about it or leave it willingly and if you should ever have to you will never forget about the time when you had one. 

My problem is that i bypassed the whole echlon of the upgrade and buy dumb luck i ended up with a 5500 as my first love. This was the conclusion that we came up to while i was being served more and more beer in hopes that my brother was able to dive deeper into my emotonal being (which he sucseeded...asshole...hehe). This combined with the fact that i finaly relaized that if i didnt say the 4 words ""i still love you"" when i was back in her bed holding her in febuary obviously means that i am not supposed to be with her and to move on with my life. To this end i say thank you katie for the memories and for showing me what real love is i will never forget you for this. Im glad you and i have a friendship now and i hope somday i have the balls to show you this...but somehow i really dont think i will.

"event","Wow its been quite some time since i last updated this thing. Well alot has happend in the past little while. I have finished school with a 3.0 avarage. I have found out i have been transfered to a new store that hasent even been built yet with my manager. I was seeing a girl named robin who i then ended it wiht after 3 weeks as shes fucking nuts. And i built my new computer. I have also come to the total conclusion that i will never be happy with anyone in my life except for katie and i am begining to accept that fact. I dont know what it is about her but i am head over heals for her still. And because i keep compareing all the others to her i am not happy with any one. Like amie, her and i could have had a very good long lasting relationship but i ended it becuase i was going back to bc to see katie and i didnt want to be with anyone in case somthing happend. I just cant seem to get her out of my head. My boss gave me a budda zen test the other day and it had a section with 5 diffrent colors. You had to put a persons name next to each color. Here is how mine went. 

yellow - lisa
Orange - jessica
Green - brock
red - katie
White - leanne

Well here is what the diffrent colors mean. 

yellow- somone who is close to you
green - somone you will never forget
orange - a true friend
white - your soulmate
red - someone who you truly love

Go figure even a fucking zen test can figure out that i still love her. I wish i knew what to do. I miss her so bad it hurts somtimes. I keep thinking about holding her in my arms 2 months ago and i long to be back there. God i wish i coulf figure this out. 

~Its a shame they never told you about the demons in your eyes~

Its amazing what will jump out at you. That was a piece of graffti i saw at work. And it touched my soul"

"event","Well hello hello,

This will be a first for me as i dont think i have ever written anything down while high before. Yes that is correct i am baked off my ass right now and enjoying it quite a lot. Anyhow a few years ago i was dateing this girl named kathy. Now kathy was/is a really cool chick and i was lucky enough to be with her for awhile until in my own stupidness (is that a word...well it is now haha) i lost her and as so many other times in life i lost contact with her. Now lucky for me a good friend and long time brother of mine stayed in touch with her and last week when he spent the night her added her to my msn list. The next thing i know were talking for the first time in 3 years. We only talked for a few minutes but i couldnt get this girl off my mind. In all honestly shes never really been of my mind totaly. This is the only other woman in my life that has ever come close to my feelings for kate. And inevitably thats what ended us i got scared and ended it. In  any case im just drivin home from work tonight when my cell rings and lo and behold its kathy. Shes asked me if i would like to come get high with her and josh. Well of course i said yes and about 1/2 hour later im at her place. Well we talked and hugged (god she still feels good in your arms) and then we went downstairs. Well her and i got to talking about how life has been and it turns out that her and i have both been keeping up on each others lifes. She like myself has taken quite an intrest in computers and we ended up talking about it for quite some time. Its really funny the other day when my new gas attendant andrew found out i was married we got to talking about my ex and then some of the things ive been through and stuff. I said to him that i enjoyed all the experiances iv had and im happy with life. He asked me then if there was anything i regreted and i told him that there were only 2 things i regreted, 1. was moving up here and leaving katie behind 2, was moving in with melissa when we did , we should have waited. Funny how life becomes clear at the strangest times. 

Anyhow its late and in to quote my favorite movie:

i am frank, frank must go.

untill next time
~X~"

"event","My heart is broke, my will is gone 
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon 
She hook me to the gills all of her forbidden thrills 
I call her baby for short then I ramble on 
She'll forget about me 

My soul is high, my mind is free 
Met a shorty with some back call her Destiny 
She showed me all my fates, my stream of conscious navigates 
I orbit around the sun at high velocity 
Don't forget about me, don't forget about 
Sweet things won't you save my soul 
Pretty lady, won't you take me home [X2]...tonight 

My arms are heavy, my body's tense 
Got the hot's for this honey named Confidence 
She points out all of my flaws, breaking all of her favorite laws 
Never speaks a word in my defense, just forget about me 

My spirit's weak, my lust will thrive 
Got a thing for this bitch said her name's a lie 
She controls me with her fear, my prayers fall on her cold deaf ear 
She says have a good time and take your dive 
Just forget about me, just forget about 
Sweet things, won't you save my soul (yeah) 
Pretty lady, won't you take me home 
Sweet thing won't you save my soul (yeah) 
Pretty lady won't you take me home...tonight 
I've got a Babylon feelin', I've got a Babylon feelin' 
I've got a Babylon feelin', I'm feelin' Babylon 

My heart is broke, my will is gone 
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon 
She hook me to the gills, all of her forbidden thrills 
I call her baby for short then I ramble on, and I ramble on 
I've got a Babylon feelin', I've got a Babylon feelin' 
I've got a Babylon feelin', feelin', feelin', yeah [X4] 

Got this in my email today:

""Hey,

Don't have a heck of a lot to say except that I think I'm falling headover 
heels in love with..........  We've already kind of talked of living together 
eventually.  It's fabulous, I am so excited.  Things are going so good, but 
I have to go do homework now.""

It sucks to love somone who wont love you back. The worst part is they have only been together less then a fucking month. 1 FUCKING MONTH!!!!!!! 1 month ago i was laying beside her in her bed. We were holding each other as though it was the last timw on earth it was ever going to happen. I guess maybe it was. 

fuck am i a stupid man."

"event","Wow i think i have just heard one of the greatest songs in my life. The new evelast track White Trash Beautiful is an amazing song. If you havent heard it then dowload it now as you wont be dissapointed. Well My ex amy came over last night. It was pretty cool and stuff. We talked and ended up getting back together. I dont know how long its going to last but hey why not go for it. I also got my mid-term marks back and holy shit i got an A on it. Never though that would happen but i guess i just might have finally found the career path that i should be on. 

I emailed katie the other night after she emailed me. She really happy with this new guy clayton and im happy for her. If i cant be the one to make her happy at least someone can. Althought i have to admit that its really nice being able to talk to her about life as a friend and not my gf. I hope she has finally found the love that she has been missing. 

Ive been talking to my buddy justin ever since i was back in bc and fuck is it nice. I forgot just how much i missed talking to him. Hes a good guy and im glad he was man enough to talk to me just as im glad that i was able to pull my head out of my ass and forgive the past bullshit. 

In all right now life is pretty good ... wow i havent said that in along time. Hello self glad to have you back with us again cause its been quite some time. 

* white trash beautiful , theres somthing you should know , my heart belongs to you , i know you could have found a better guy , ill love you till the day i die , i swear to god its true , im comming home to you*"

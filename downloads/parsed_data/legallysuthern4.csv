SCREW IT!!!!!!!!! WHAT CAN U DO IN 4 DAYS?!?!?!?!?!?!? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!!!!!! IM PISSED ABOUT THAT!!!!!!!!!! grrrrrrrrr) but anyway yea & i was thinking....how many ppl r actually reading this? i dont think anyone is i mean unless ur really bored ur not gunna sit there & read like a page of crap about someone elses drama...dont we all have enough of that in our own lives? i mean if someone tells u a story over the phone or online or something like that but i mean sitting there reading a full page?!?!?!? i think not!!!! no one has enough time for that i dont think! at least i dont! like me & luke were talking & it was like this:

me: sooooo i havent talked to u in forever...do u have a gf
luke: no
me: & why not?
luke: i dont have the time...school football dinner homework bed & then it starts over again
me: i kno thats my problem too not enough time
luke: there just rnt enough hours in the day!
me: i kno its sad!!! i mean were only 13!!!!!!
luke: i kno it is sad!

it was sooo funny today in choir....ok so first kno this... we have a warm up that goes...who washed washington's white wooly underwear when washington's washing woman went west (and we singit really really fast & its so much fun) anyway...so mr womack (on of the choir teachers) was saying that he wanted the tenor/bass choir (the guys with the period before us) to sing that but lightly & softly but he ended up saying something like...""ok guys now sing who washed washington's but, lightly & softly"" & they all started laughing & they were like u said who washed washington's but!!!! hahahahahaha ok u had to b there to hear him explain it but it was still funny

ok the other thing...ok ya kno how sunday was september 11? ok well i watched this thing that talked about flight 93 which was the one that was gunna hit the capital building but it didnt & the story was that these 4 guys hijacked the plane (obviously) & so all of the ppl were pushed back into coach & so the ppl were calling their families & thier families were telling them that there were planes that flew into the twin towers & the pentagon & so the ppl realized that they couldnt sit back & let them drive the plane into the capital & kill all of the ppl that were in there....they were gunna stop them so they brought the flight attendants cart (which weighs somewhere around 200-300 pounds) & they smashed into one of the guys & they threw boiling water at another guy & stuff & so the guy who was driving the plane desided to just run it into the ground but they said that the ppl were trying to break into the cockpit & the recording of the sound hasnt been released yet but some of the family members that heard it said that right when the tape stoped ...it sounded like the ppl broke into the cockpit & yea it was cool but another sad thing was that a lot of the ppl switched flights just to b on that one & the truth is that all of those ppl saved everyone who was left in the capital...cool huh! i thought it was
anyway

today i made 35$ for babysitting my neighbors & im saving up for christmas & the 8th grade trip!!!!!!! but anyway for christmas every year my parents always gives us one big present & then a bunch of little ones like...when i was little i would get like a bike or something like that & last year i got my stareo& stuff and i figured out what i want as my big present this year...this is how my idea came to me...ok so i was thinking about how hearing some inside jokes from my friends in rochester & seeing pictures still isnt the same as actually being there to hang out with everyone so i decided that i want one of those vido cameras that makes dvd's so when i come to visit all my rochester peeps i can video tape it & then when i miss everyone or when i want to remember the good ol days then i can watch my dvd...it would b soooo much fun!
now im really excited & i cant wait till christmas break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

yesterday was so fun.  me and my friend rebecka & my cousin monica went to see red eye last night! it was the first night it was out plus it was a friday night so it was chaos at the movie theater! but heres the story:

ok so we were supposed to go to the 7:30 show and we ordered tickets online and everything but we couldnt make that one because monica had too much traffic coming home form work so we were going to go to the 8:55 so we called rebecka's mom to see if we could cancel the tickets online and get new ones but then rebeckas mom was mad because she said that we couldnt cancel the tickets we could just order new ones.  so monica called the movie theater & they said that we could go to coustomer service when we got there & chage the times so becka called her mom and i called my dad so it was good. we were late to the theater and the coustomer service line was kinda long so it took a while. when we got our tickets becka went to the bathroom and monica got snacks and i went to get seats.  well turns out they gave us tickets for the 9:50 show not the 8:55 show so i talked to a guy after walking into several different red eye theaters.  finally we found the right theater but we couldnt find 3 seats next to each other. luckily some nice ppl moved over so we watched the movie.  it was a good movie like a good story behind it ya kno but it wasnt scary i thought it would be really scary but it wasnt it just had like one scary part the rest of it is just suspenceful but it was good.

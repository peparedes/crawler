"event","So.  Starting tomorrow, November 1, is National Novel Writing Month.  Everyone is hereby challenged to write 50,000 words in 30 days.  That is only 100 pages in 30 days, or 1,500 words a day using single-spaced, 12pt Times New Roman text.  That's the equivilant of a 3-page essay, people!  I know that all the students here can pull off a half-assed 3-page essay in a single day.

Regardless, I am taking up that challenge.  And, for the explicit entertainment of my entire audience here in the LJ community, I shall be posting my progress periodically.  I won't be posting all of my 1,500 words each day, as that'd be stupid if I stopped in the middle of a sentence or if it makes a paragraph end too short.  I will also report how many words I actually will accomplish each day in addition to the day's excerpt.  For a heads-up, I shall be posting a <i>filme noir</i> that I've been wanting to write for ages.  Those who know me and my sadistic writing fetishes will know the topic of my <i>filme</i> ahead of time.  Those who don't ... well, enjoy the ride anyway.  Don't forget to buckle up!

Don't forget to post any critiques in the conveniently placed Comments section of each post.  I'll gladly take all props and flames that I can acquire from this madness.

But, until tomorrow, peeps, have a safe Halloween and keep it surreal.  ^_^"

<b>Series:  </b>Katamari Damacy/X 1999 x-over
<b>P.S:  </b>Don't even ask ... I don't think that <i>I</i> want to know ...

<i>The Stars of Destiny have gathered in Tokyo for the final showdown.  The seven Seals and the seven Angels square off against each other at the foot of the Tokyo Tower; it is a standstill.  The ""true"" Kamui had yet to be determined, and not enough people have died enough to make it a traditional CLAMP climax.</i>

""The Earth <i>will</i> have its revolution, Kamui,"" <i>Fuuma snarled.</i>

""Not if I can help it, Fuuma,"" <i>Kamui yelled back from the other side of the Tower grounds.

The Dragons of Earth stare and snarl at the Dragons of Heaven.  The Dragons of Heaven start charging up their supernatural CLAMP School powers.  Finally, both groups decide that they're sick and tired of looking at each other from afar; the two groups charge against each other.

Suddenly, a the ground begins to shake, causing the cliche apocalyptic battle to pause.  The Dragons of Earth and Heaven look around, confused and try to determine where this new source of phenominal power is coming from.  Subaru and Seishiro are the first ones to be picked up by a two hundred metre tall ball of <b>stuff</b> being pushed by a one inch tall, green, ant-like thingy.  The remainder of the Stars of Destiny scream in horror as they too are stuck to the Gobstopper of Hell, the third army to perfectly balance the powers with an interest in the end of the world.

Oblivious to the screams of humanity, the giant <b>katamari</b> blissfully rolls on to pick up the Tokyo Tower, saved from the imminent doom it was about to face in CLAMP fashion.  There goes the neighbourhood ... Literally.</i>"

"event","For those who don't quite notice, it is very difficult for me to be honest with my emotions.  Normally, I take it in stride on the grounds that it comes with the whole package about what it is that I can do and what it is that I have been <i>charged</i> to do.  Yes, that is correct; I have been ordained, destined, ordered, what have you, to do these things that I do.  I do not care what people think about personal choice or whatnot; the bottom line is that I have been given a task for this world, and it is imperative that I <i>must</i> accomplish this task before my time is up.  I tried to avoid it in the past, believe me, but now it has come back to bite me in my huge, hairy, white ass and it has not let go, nor will it ever let go until I have done what I must.

For those who never cared, I am an empath, through and through.  I detect emotions in other people when I do not wish to.  I tried ""turning it off,"" but it ended up harming me more than anything.  That being said, it is very difficult to lie to me.  One must be very adept in masking one's emotions in order to pull the wool over my eyes about something.  Either that, or one must be a professional bullshitter.  ""You can't con a con artist,"" right Magz?  Because one cannot lie to me, for all intents and purposes, people have come to trust me with things that I should never come in contact with.  I do not betray this trust, not by any means, and through that display of trust, I have been able to heal and help a great number of individuals in my time.  Granted, a couple dozen may not seem much on the wider scale of 33 million in the country or 6 billion globally, but who knows how many people those couple dozen have helped because of the help they all received?  Your guess is as good as mine, and I am not the one to say.

So, I ask any who take time to read this, how is it that I cannot be honest with myself?  Better yet, is it any surprise to any of you who care that I cannot actually come out and tell you all exactly what is bothering me?  All I can say is that I hurt and I wish for someone to be merciful and stab me so that I may feel physical pain where I feel emotional/spiritual/internal pain.  God, it's almost 2 in the morning and I have a 0930 class.  I cannot sleep because of this pain that is, for once, not gaseous in nature.  At least everyone else is asleep, and I can type like this without bothering anyone.  Perhaps ... No.  I have defeated that particular demon a long time ago, and I am <i>not</i> letting it win this time.  I have too much at stake to let it beat me, now.

Yeah, well whatever.  I shall go and see if I can get to sleep.  If not, then I shall merely refrain from attending class tomorrow.  It is not as though I need to know everything <i>all</i> the time, right?"

"event","You know what, Guys?  I've been thinking a lot of where I'm heading on this adventure with you lot.  I've been starting to think if it's all going to be worth it or not.  I had three conversations this week that have me thinking that we were destined for something else.  Not to say that we deserve what we're striving for, but that there are other things for us to pursue as well.  What I'm wondering is merely the order in which to do things.

The first conversation I had got me wanting to give all this up and become a troll.  I tried to convince someone to go trolling around Fairview Park Mall during his four-hour break one day.  He said that he won't troll anywhere other than eBay *rolls eyes* and that he'll never go anywhere that he has to pay retail ever again.  So, that got me thinking that I wanted to be a professional troll.  But, in order to do that, I'd have to obtain enough funds to purchase either of the bridges crossing over to the United States from Ontario and rename it the Greg Brightman Troll Bridge.  Then, I'd have to get signs which all read ""Pay Troll,"" and I'd have to be there to collect it.

The second one got me thinking that we're getting into the wrong industry.  For this year's busness computing classes, the textbooks came with a 128MB USB key.  Not a bad deal for the first year students.  And losers like me who had their paperwork lost in the bureaucracy and now have to retake the damned course.  *grumble grumble*  Well, in any case, I had placed my key on my keychain and got talking about it with another friend of mine.  I joked, ""Yeah, I put my USB key on my keychain, left the appartment, tried out the new key.  Heeeeeey!  Wait a minute!""  The idea that was spawned in that flash-in-the-pan moment of insight was the new wave of electronic security.  It is somewhat complex and costly, but rather feasible:  Store a person's personal information including a DNA sample onto a memory stick.  Then a security unit at home is programmed with a system that contains all authorized users, as well as a confirmation protocol which verifies the DNA of the holder is the DNA in the system.  Complex and expensive, but rather effective, don't you think?

The third one has me semi-devoted to bring the prophecies of John Titor to reality.  John Titor claims to be a time traveller who came back from an America that was destroyed by a civil war.  A NUCLEAR civil war.  He says that it's supposed to start within the next decade or so.  I believe that I have a cause.  First, think upon the legal definition of the word ""rape.""  Next, think about what the Catholic church has been doing to erradicate homosexuality.  Finally, think about who runs the Catholic church.  I have come to the conclusion that it is the men in the church who are attempting to force sexuality upon society upon unwilling participants.  That, for all intents and purposes, is rape.  Perhaps I shall do some digging and seed sowing over the next couple of months and see what happens ...

So, uhm, yeah.  That's what I've been thinking about Guys.  Believe me, I'm still in on The Plan, but I'm already planning for other ventures and/or possibilities.  You know, to cover all my bases and all and to dream about a more distant future.  *shrug*  Man's gotta dream doesn't he?

Keep it surreal."

"event","<i>I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
And right now, you don't care.</i>

It's finally gotten to the point where I see work as a means of escape.  Yeah, that's right, I've finally snapped.  Again.  It seems as though, this late in the work term, that I'm able to finally cut loose around the guys there.  This comes from the blasted fact that I have to be serious in the ""outside world,"" so to speak.  It's more than the fact that school's starting and I have to shift it back into gear again, too.  As of late, the universe, God, Fate, what have you, has decided that it was time to remind me of my (materially) rewardless and thankless job here on this mortal coil.  To pile onto matters, karma has chosen this to be its time to finally get back to me with that downswing by slowly taking away whatever happiness that I've obtained for me, piece by heartsickening piece.

<i>Welcome to the Jungle,
We've got fun and games.</i>

It's gotten to the point that even my video and card games, fiction (which I should try to start up again) and even my RPs have become my ""normal life.""  Part of it comes, I think, from me having to do my ""job"" on more than one occasion during some sessions at these activities.  What can I say?  I'm a very responsible person.  Whenever something goes wrong, I'm responsible!  Seriously though, it kinda feels good to have the sense of <i>belonging</i> and <i>purpose</i> that I get when I'm called off to wear my metaphorical cape and mask.  I have to rent the tux, top hat and cane, and roses don't come cheap so any of my clientelle who wish that of me gets charged extra.  :B

<i>I would do anything for love,
But I won't do <b>that.</b></i>

I got my highlights done the other week.  Everyone in my ""family"" said that I've become gaier because of it.  Everyone in my family didn't recognize me when they came to bring me back here, to the Land of Boredom.  One of the guys at work asked me, ""So do the drapes match the carpet?""  My response: ""You can find out the next time I invite you over for a drink.""  It's for random trade-offs such as that which I live.  Events in my life caused me to think that I had to ""grow up faster than normal,"" and now I feel as though I need to get that childishness back.  At the same time, I also desire the seriousness and rigorous trials that come with ""adulthood"" and ""real life,"" and I want to get it all in as quickly as I can.  Thus, I am going to miss the people at Lake Erie Steel; as childish as they can be, they are very much serious and I admire them greatly.  That same guy I had the banter with, I gave my contact information to so as to not burn any of my bridges or sever any connections with possible business partners or clientelle.  He runs his own business - many of them do, as a matter of fact - and I've offered him advice about how to proceed with things.  And, who knows?  He may have need of my <i>other</i> services in the future, as well.

<i>Pride is just the price I pay;
Destiny is calling me
To open up my eager eyes.</i>

In my ""year in limbo,"" that being the year I stayed in Windsor without being in school, I felt utterly horrible.  I felt that I failed and failed <i><b>big time.</b></i>  I felt that I had failed my family, my friends, my mentors, my loved ones and even myself.  Because of this, I have an irrational abhorrance and fear of failure.  Even when I first moved to Kitchener, I felt as though I was failing everyone that I had made a promise, a deal, and a commitment to; it was as though everyone else was riding the waves of success and I was dragging my feet, even though it was all that I could do at any given point in time.  But, it didn't take too long, relatively, for me to realize that I <i>am</i> succeeding because <i>I</i> am doing the things that <i>I</i> want, how <i>I</i> want them done, and with whom <i>I</i> want to share this success.  Talking to my co-worker rekindled that fire.  I look at the <i>children</i> in my class and I see lost souls who are only there either for the prospect of big money for small work or because of their parents.  Oh, granted, there are those rare ones who share the same sentiments as I do, but I've not seen them in my particular class.  That being said, I <i>know</i> that I am better than the rest of those <i>bloody <b>children</b></i> because I <i><b>want</b></i> it, and nothin's gonna stop in my way until I <i><b>get</b></i> it.  Those of you who want to latch on now, you had better buckle your seatbelts, 'cause you'll be in for the ride of your life.  I <i>gar-own-tay!</i>

<i>'Cause it's now or never;
I ain't gonna live forever ...
It's.  My.  Life.</i>"

"event","I have worked in the Slab Caster at Lake Erie Steel Company for about three months, now.  I've worked there before, on two seperate four-month work terms, and I am ashamed to admit that this has never occured to me until earlier this week.  At a steel mill, particularily in the Slab Caster, it is easy for one to determine a steelworker's sexuality strictly based upon his own responsiblities.  It is at this time that I wish to share my findings with the LJ popluace.

<i><b>Craneman, Pulpit Operator, Steelpourer:</b>  These jobs are located somewhere above the Caster floor proper.  As such, individuals who fill these positions look down upon most of the Caster crew throughout the shift.  Thus, due to their ""elevated status,"" they enjoy being dominant and ""on top"" in their sexual relations.
<b>Slab Cutter, Grade Stamper:</b>  These jobs are located below the Caster floor proper.  People working at these tasks are completely at the mercy of those on the Caster floor, as they cannot do their job until slabs of steel are available.  That being said, people filling these roles tend to be submissive and ""on the bottom"" of their sexual relations.
<b>Strand Operator, Tundishman, Utilityman:</b>  These jobs take place on the Caster floor itself.  The duties that these individuals perform are routine in nature, but are known to be controlled by the Foreman's every whim.  This makes these individuals subject to long, torturous shifts filled with unpredictable workloads and making them very much masochistic.
<b>Foreman:</b>  Need I say any more?  The Foreman is in charge of the whole operation, or so he thinks.  This mentality enables a Foreman to delegate menial tasks to members of his crew at random and he takes great pleasure in it.  As if nobody here already knew, Foremen are very, very sadistic.</i>

Well.  I hope that everyone here has been well-educated in the workings of a steel mill.  Any questions, boys and girls?  If not, then keep it surreal."

"event","I finally found out where the disco ball is at the steel mill!  After three summers and one winter of searching, I have finally been told where the elusive artefact resides!  One of the guys that I'm <i>really</i> close with *wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more, say no more* spilled the beans and told me of the complex rite they perform in the dead of winter, when all they want to do is dance, dance, dance.  

Apparently, the button is contained in a secret panel in the pulpit which overlooks the Caster, and is unlocked through three keys which must be turned simultaneously.  Then, after The Button is pressed, everything stops, and the guys strip off their coveralls and shirts as the main lights dim and the club lights start up and flash on and off to the beat and rhythm of <i>Everybody Dance Now</i> while the ball decends from a hidden chamber high above the Caster.

As closet-gay they are, my co-workers are very shy about performing this ritual in the summer, when students such as myself are around.  Which is quite understandable, however, when there are curious individuals such as I who want to participate in this bonding ritual, one should accomodate.  But, sadly, there are females who are hired, as well, and the guys don't want any more sexual harrassment claims.  However, now that our own female - another student - is out on Worker's Compensation for spraining her ankle Wednesday night/Thursday morning, we have absolutely no problem with that impediment.

Said incident is the third that we've had in the last two weeks in my building.  The first one in my department, thankfully.  Hopefully, the last.  Even more hopefully, I may be the next one, so I may luxuriate at home while under Comp for the rest of the summer.  ^_^

Also, I found out that I was working during a full moon the hard way, again.  For the second time this summer, I felt utterly depressed while on the job and people started a) freaking out and b) mocking me for it.  Worst yet, everyone else suffers the ""hyper type"" of lunacy where I'm at.  Even more worse, most of them don't even realize it.  Worst of all, nobody fucking cares.  

But, why should I expect them to, being in a ""real man's"" job such as this?  Nobody realize what I do on a daily basis at that place, so nobody can help me when I get like this.  Nobody'll ever realize that I had felt guilty to being so close to the incident and not being able to do anything - and, possibly being indirectly responsible for the accident - that I had most likely wasted my own energy trying to make sure that she could heal somewhat quickly and not be in as much pain or discomfort while aiding the Emergency Response Team get her out fo the building.  Then, after all that, I had helped those on the floor get set up and prepared for start-up (for we had to stop production for a while, at that time) when everyone else responsible for the task was sitting on their own lazy, self-important, selfish asses and then gave my own casting team a half-hour break for each of them both after we started up, while being drained, hot, sweaty, and parched.

On the one hand, I like the fact that nobody knows what I do and who I am.  On the other hand, nobody knows who I am or what I do, so nobody can help me.  So, where do I turn, other than to myself for twelve hours at a time?  Only for six more weeks do I have to endure this.  Mayhap less, if I collapse inexplicibly.

[/long, pent-up, fury-filled rant]

I know that this is two days late, but still:

Keep it surreal, folks.  And, my new catch phrase I wish to try out: <i>Love as thou wilt.</i>"

"event","<u>Alternate Title:</u>  Everybody Dance Now!

I was kind of inspired for the title by <i>Sex and the City.</i>  It was explained that the title of that particular television series was made to point out to viewers that the show was about <i>both</i> things, rather than just having sex while in a city.  Don't ask where this flash of artistic insight came from, as it has already left me.

The point is that last weekend was the Pride Festival in Toronto, and people at work brought in a copy of the Toronto Sun with highlights of the parade.  Being the middle-aged steelworkers that they are, eternally stuck in their insensitive and inflexible ways, said newspaper was decorated with many lewd comments about other colleagues.  One comment was made that the Sunshine Girl on the back page was actually female, much to everyone's surprise.  I left the argument about how much plastic and thousands of dollars worth of surgery that could have been used to ensure that it was a female alone, needless to say.

Therefore, on my crew at the least, there is no Pride <i>in</i> the Steel Mill.  Hence the title and its inspiration.

This is also surprising, due to the ever infamous episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> where Homer takes Bart to the gay steel mill.  That episode has, unofficially, made the song, <i>Everybody Dance Now</i> the theme song for the United Steelworkers of America.  By the way, I'm still looking for that disco ball.  It's my last summer at the plant, and I intend on finding it, even if it means pushing all the buttons that nobody wants me to push.

I hope that all of my Canadian subscribers have a fun long weekend.  I am working nights all weekend, so have some extra fun for little ol' me, will ya?  Please?  *twinkle twinkle*"

"event","Why does it seem as though, as of late, I'm being forced to speed up my normally relaxed-paced life beyond what my capabilities lie?

Work is one thing.  There, I have to deal with the unethical, yet completely legal, it seems, treatment of being ""the student.""  Whatever.  I'll do any task that I'm asked to do there without complaint because that makes me a better man than the rest of them.  Even still, we have an understanding there that I can only do so much at my own pace, else I may get myself into some physical trouble.  Not that I'll die or get in some sort of ""serious"" condition, though those are very strong possibilities, but instead, it's more likely that I'll be unable to perform <i>any</i> task due to passing out right there on the floor because of one health problem or another.

My ambitions are another thing.  Research and work for The Plan is going rather well, considering we have been actively working on it for a few days.  However, the Plan Leader seems to be more ambitious than I am, and wants to be set up and ready for take-off within a year.  That scares me.  First, from a financial POV, it seems to be unrealistic to get up and running in that amount of time.  Second, co-ordination with Plan Members seems to be off right now, even though there are hopes that will rectify within the next two or three months.  *shrug*  Again, whatever.  This is my ambition as well, and I will do this, but keep in mind, ""haste makes waste,"" and I do not wish to see this highly successful endeavour to fail because we get sloppy, y'know?

Finally, there are those who - and there are a lot of you, despite popular belief - I've said, ""Hang on.  Wait a minute.  I need time to catch up; you're going too fast for me,"" and have just kept on going at a pace that would make Speed Racer embarassed.  Even with my current rate of progress and success in my personal goals to benefit the whole, it just seems as though people just want to keep going on without me.  *shrug*  Perhaps, I'm being told that I had better get the lead out, or nobody's going to wait anymore.  Whatever.  If that's the case, and you don't need me, then I will come to the same conclusion; I won't drag anyone down, just as I won't let anyone drag <i>me</i> down, or just drag me.  Besides, if it comes to that extreme, then perhaps you were just using me all along, anyway.  And, you all should know how I feel about that ...

So, in conclusion, I say once again:  Slow down, and take it easy for a while.  Despite our fleeting moments here on this mortal coil, we are not running out of so much time that we still cannot just <i>enjoy</i> life anymore.  Perhaps one needs better management to make one's one desires and ambitions come to fruition, for though it seems as though I'm moving at a snail's pace, I'm still doing rather well for myself.

I implore you, smell the roses once in a while and, above all else, keep it surreal.  'Cause, sometimes, reality sucks."

Number of other, non-serious injuries I have acquired to date: 4
Times I have wanted to lay my Foreman out: 22
Times my Foreman <i>took me off of the job</i> to perform other, meaningless tasks: 3
Factor by which I can perform my Foreman's job better than he can: 200x

"event","Well, I went for my physical yesterday.  Apparently, I passed the seeing and hearing tests satisfactorily.  I was kinda worried, as I usually fail those types of tests.  And personality tests; those are the worst.  Anyway, I have all of my papers lined up, proving that I was a student last term and that I will be a student next term, when they tell me that I don't have the right one.  -.-  Five pieces of information that are telling them both, most of which are bearing the college's letterhead and/or seal!  The fuck?  Haven't you heard of ""derived information?""  I understand that the company - and others like it - have been reamed by students in the past because of them saying that they'll be back, only to not in the end.  But, the letter that the company now wants is, in all actuality, less proof that students will be returning than before.  The letter must detail that the student has been registered in a course, as well as a projected graduation date.  This does not, in truth, say anything about the student being elgible to attend the following term.  On top of that, it is ultimately the student's decision to return or not.  So, basically, what all this means is that I was there, with every scrap of information that says that I am elgible to resume my education in the Fall, as well as the intention of continuing in the Fall, and they want a piece of paper that says neither but also has the college's seal.  The fuck?  Let's ignore the fact that the company may still be purchased by an outside investor in the near future, presenting the chance of my employment being shot up to all Hell.

So, I called the college about this.  After ten minutes of listening to an automated message, I got to talk to someone real about this.  She said that I had to be physically present in the Registrar's Office in order for this thing to be processed.  I don't care about the $15 charge that cannot possbily be billed to me, or even charged to my student account as part of next year's tuition.  As much as I hated Windsor's administration, they didn't charge me for this type of letter.  All <i>they</i> did was make it a painfully long process to obtain it, the bastards.  *sigh*  Now, I'm waiting on Phil to see if he can take me up to the college sometime before Friday.  If not, then I'll have to bother family.  I'd rather not, firstly because it's family, secondly because if Phil and I make it too late and the Registrar closes before we get there, we can still dick around with people in the Tri-City.

Stupid college, stupid universe, stupid life.

I still say that none of this would be happening if that accident never happened.  Maybe I'm still too arrogant, and I've not learned my lessons from that incident.  Maybe I really <i>am</i> dead, and I'm really walking around as a zombie.  Naaaah.  That can't be what it is.  I mean, at the very least, I would have been shot by Resident Evil or White Wolf LARPers by now, if that was the case.

"event","So, okay.  It's been a long time since I've updated here, but that's what I get for having a useless piece of crap computer that decided to die on me after only four years of servitude.  On top of that, there's my inability to take control of a shared computer for more than an hour or so, and my facination with being <i>outside</i> when the sun is shining and playing video games when it's not.  By these powers combined, I am Captain No-Life.  Well, there are the few communities that I have joined in the last couple of months, but I'll get to them later.

But, for now, I'd like to ask what the <i>hell</i> is wrong with this world?  Everytime I leave a place, things there go to absolute shit!  This all started when I first went off to school: Some people got themselves into dire straits not long after I had initially moved to Windsor.  It happened again when I left Windsor after my first year there to work at Stelco; tensions quickly flared up in the new house <i>before</i> we had *really* moved in.  When I got back in Windsor, people here in Simcoe started to die on me for no fucking reason.  I can't remember for the life of me what happened when I moved during the next year, but I'm pretty sure that it was something that drove me insane - more so than normal.  Finally, when I moved to K-W, I find that The House is breaking up - finally, after everyone wanting to kill His Perpetually-Insane Whaleness - and now that I'm back in Simcoe, I hear that Kevin, of all people, is engaged to a girl that he virtually doesn't know.  What the hell, people?  I know that since my accident I've been wearing an astral ""Kick Me"" sign on my back, but seriously!  Why must I always be the only one who provides the brains in an area?  This is <i>me</i> we're talking about.  I don't have <i>any</i> brains, let alone enough to provide to an entire network of friends.

Grrr.  So, yeah.  I'm back in Simcoe again.  Waiting to go to a physical, again.  Starting next week, I'll be working at Ye Olde Steel Mill, again.  After the summer, I'll be having people mob me for money, again.  *sigh*  Times are tough.  Apparently, in the factory that I'm working in (not confirmed yet, will be today), there was an accident with the ocillator a few months back.  The entire plant was shut down for the two weeks that it took for them to get the cooled steel out of the line and off of the Caster's floor.  I know that it's a relatively safe job, but who knew that the 10% chance of something going horribly wrong would have actually happened?  Hopefully, since something drastic has already happened, nothing bad will happen to me this summer.

Since March, I've belonged to a couple of communities that I found through Gaia Online.  I've spent so much time on them, that I forgot all about Gaia afterwards, and it was a struggle for Emi and Allan to get me to do my homework and final reports.  They're both communities for the Wheel of Time novels by Robert Jordan - one is a discussion board mostly on theories and speculations about the series, the other is more of a role-playing site where members interact with each other in a text-based environment that is intended to simulate the world of the books.  On the RP site, I have decided to personify myself as on of the five biggest fangirl crushes of the series.  I did so with the intention of acting somewhat differently from what the character does cannonically, and I'm doing a rather good job at it, if I do say so myself.  Despite this, one fangirl hasn't been disuaded at all by my performance and has decided to have a crush on poor Perrin Aybara of the Wheel of Time Realms.  I'm enjoying it to no end; I have lots of fun playing as this character, fulfilling my own desires as well as this fangirl's.  On top of that, Emi seems to approve.  Mainly 'cause it gives her some sort of perverse entertainment, but that's another story.  The thing is, though, that the more that I RP with this fangirl, the more I have the feeling that it's <i>someone</i> that I know.  Now, I know that the odds of this are against me, especially with a webcommunity, but it's just been tickling at the back of my mind that she's been to this LJ - it's listed as my website on the community - and saw that it was me and is now having even more pleasure out of it.  Even if it <i>is</i> someone that I know, I have absolute faith that I will <i>never</i> find out who it is.  Thus, I continue to have my fun.

*sigh*  Times are tough.

"event","Okay, people who care, listen up 'cause I can only say this once.

My computer has fried itself.  I don't know how it happened, but every attempt to recussitate it has failed.  I'm assuming the motherboard had decided to die on me after four and a half years of faithful, loyal, undying servitude.  Thus, I sit here and give you this message from one of the college's computers.

Don't expect me to be online at all too often, let alone on MSN or any gaming sites as I used to.  Even if we <i>did</i> manage to transplant my monitor to Emi's computer as we had successfully done with my mouse, with three users and one computer, I'll be sacrificing my nerdy needs during my spare time and instead will be using these things at Conestoga.  However, I wish to leave a message for Mr. Phil Klassen, if he reads this, regarding quotes for repairs and/or a completely new system.

This incident does not come to me as a surprise.  Three days ago, I had my presentation on Thailand for my English course.  That's right, people, a Geography assignment for English class.  It was supposed to be done on the Tuesday before Reading Week, but the school's network was hacked into and infected with a virus, causing the entire thing to go down.  My idiots of group members had decided that it was a good thing to have all of their presentation material on the network.  *wishes he had a Mallet of Kabong +20 to beat them repeatedly with*  So, we were pushed all the way back to this past Tuedsday, March 15, 2005.  The Ides of March.  Go figure, huh?

The fun doesn't stop there.  When I came home that day was when I found out that my computer decided to kill itself in some unritualistic fashion.  Yesterday, I found out that I'm missing $50 from my bank account that has gone unaccounted for, leaving me with a bank balance precariously hovering close to the red.

I attribute this to the fact that the Universe has decided to get as many kicks in as it can, as it knows that it has to pay me back next year, the Year of the Dog.  This will also be my only public admission that none of this would have happened if Fyl and I had decided to just stay in Simcoe during Reading Week.  None of you will <i>ever</i> get me to admit that publically again, so get over it.  =P

On the plus side, with me not having a computer to distract me, I can finally get the 60 pages of fiction finished within the 30 days that I'd <i>like</i> to have it finished in.  I'm entering in the Arrowsmith Writing Contest where I have the chance to win upto $500.  The entry doesn't have to be postmarked until May 15, but I'd like to have it done by the end of April so that I'm not entering with the ""last-minute rush.""

So, that's my life this week.  Again, I'll be updating as much as I can while at the school, but I won't be on for much else.  Now, I must leave you all; the Universe is calling me for my 10:00am beatings.

Keep it surreal for me, all."

"event","To everyone who interacts with me on a daily basis, and to those who think that he or she knows me,

If you've not gathered by now, I am a very offensive person.  Someday, everyone of you will be offended by something that I say or do.  Maybe it was today, maybe yesterday, a year ago, tomorrow or when we're all old and grey - or still young, but grey.  This, dear friends, is inevitible and cannot be avoided.  Now, I can hear some of you protesting that I've never been offensive in my life.  Well, that can be attributed to one of two reasons: 1) I've not offended you, yet or 2) you don't remember me offending you in the past because you wish to remember my once-dominant kind nature.  To some, my being unconditionally kind and generous was offensive in and of itself.  Once upon a time, I tried not to offend <i>anyone,</i> but it slowly came to me that me being who and what I am is offensive and I can't change that.  So, now, I don't rightly care if I offend anyone on the grounds of that <i>is</i> who and how I am, and it is <i>you</i> who has to deal with it, be it for a day, week, a few months, three years, three decades or for the rest of our lives - both yours <i>and</i> mine.  Hell, now that I think about it, this post will offend someone who reads it, regardless of if he or she is on my LJ Friends List or a random viewer, and I don't care.

These thoughts came to me after yet another crap-tacular day with the children at the college.  During a presentation before the Break, a bunch of them were talking over the members of my group, and I reigned them in.  These <i>children</i> thought that <i>I</i> was rude about it and wrote comments on our grading sheets - yes, students evaluate presentations in my Marketing class - such as ""Don't yell at the audience,"" or ""Attacking the audience is rude and caused us to not learn anything after,"" and my personal favourite, ""You wouldn't yell at your boss or a large group.""  I actually agree with that last one.  If my boss was being a dick when I was presenting information that would save him from losing his company, I would roll up my presentation and leave quietly.  I couldn't really do that with an <i>academic</i> presentation, because that's what is required to succeed in the course.

Thus, I summarize, mostly for the sake of those who are in my program - I dare not say ""class,"" for you are definitely <i>not</i> in my class - who may have got a hold of the URL to this journal by saying this:  Like me or hate me.  Abhor me or love me.  I don't care much which you choose to think of me, because as I said above, you have to put up with me for at least two more months, upto sixty years.  Deal with it.

Sincerely,
Greg Brightman

You are a four-sided die, a d4. Otherwise known as a tetrahedron, a ""Caltrop"", or (to a lesser degree) ""Ol' Pointy"". This crap bores you, so I'll get to the point. Others tend to see you as petty, conniving, manipulative, argumentative, defensive, greedy, and needlessly antagonistic. You see yourself as focused, effective, efficient, influencing, shrewd, tactical, and direct. Both points of view are in fact correct. You always know the best way to get things done, a fact that never wins sympathy with others. Whenever you manage to gain control of a situation, your solutions are swift and brutal. Unfortunately everyone else is convinced that granting you such power is, ""a bad thing"" and often conspire to keep it out of your hands. Such short-sighted fools!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It is my wish to forward good news to all shareholders and investors interested in my welfare.  I am alright, I am okay.  I survived and I will live, or so the doctors have informed me.  Both Mr. Klassen and I are in a little bit of pain, but nothing horribly serious.  I, personally, suffered minor back pain and bruising on and around my kneecaps.  Sadly, the small hit that I took to the top of my head did not shake anything on the inside loose, thus I am sad to say that I have not changed much mentally.

My thanks to all who were concerned about either of us.  Your concern was unwarranted, though muchly appreciated.

"event","Well, I'm entering the Midterm Phase of Semester Two of my first year of my Accounting studies.  I write three exams this week, one after Slack Week, plus one presentation this week as well.  Now, to those who remember <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/perrin__aybara/2004/09/23/"">this,</a> Heaven forbid, I'm far away from that group, now.  Thank God!  Well, I do at least.  If you all could thank whatever you'd like for me, that'd be much appreciated, as I appreciate the help.  So, today I will not rant about my presentation group.  Instead, I will rant about the topic of the presentation.

The presentation is for my Professional Presentations Skills course, where the professor has <i>not taught us any.</i>  Our presentation is on the business practices of a country where English is not the primary language.  My group decided to do Thailand on the grounds that Japan was already picked and the hope of getting a better grade because of a) the difficulty and obscurity of the research available on the country and b) the recent events that have happened to said country.  Yeesh.  How grade school can you get?  So, after getting over the fact that this is a horrible project to assign us <i>and</i> to have it be worth 50% of our final grade, I decided to get my ass in gear and provide for the group a scale map of Thailand and the nations which surround it, a PowerPoint Slideshow featuring what little bullshit we could come up with including my research on Geography, Demographics, History and Politics, and a script for my part of the presentation.  All of which took me a total of approximately 72 hours of work, spread over the spanse of about four weeks.

Now, I'm finished with only 36 hours left to ""rehearse"" our project.  Truth be told, had two of my group not left for a vacation <i>before</i> Spring Break, I would have been ready for presentation and rehearsal by this time last week.  But, I decided that if they were going to slack off and damage my grade, I'm not gonna work my ass off to give them a semi-decent one.  I know it'll probably hurt me in the end, but that's what they get for thinking that I'd do all the fucking work.  *sighs in frustration*  I know I said that I'm not gonna rant about them, but it's never going to leave me now that I've proved myself to be another god among men and that I know everything.  <i>That</i> itself is gonna fuck me more than anything.

Anyway, that's a brief update on my scholarly life.  I shall update you on my mental status and my social life possibly tomorrow, Tuesday or Wednesday when I'm not so bloody busy.  I will, however, leave you with this announcement:

This is a repeat broadcast to those who stumble upon this on a semi-regular basis and either live in the Kitchener-Waterloo region or who can get here on a regular basis.  I am currently in the late stages of planning a Sailor Moon Role-Playing Game.  Anyone who are interested and meet the requirements above please either email me at aybarastudios@gmail.com or comment to this post.  If you do not or cannot meet these requirements, but are still interested, contact me with any suggestions for an alternative method of involving you in this endeavour.  I plan to start within the next two weeks, and will be running sessions on Sunday of every week.  Thank you."

"event","I hate being like this.
I have absolutely no rational reason to be so, either; it just started out of the blue and for some reason, I can't really shake it.
Anyone who knows me well knows that I'll attempt to not let it visibly affect me and I'll just keep on moving, but only the very few who <i>reallly</i> know me would know what memories have suddenly resurfaced.
It didn't help when Winamp decided to randomly play a song that's very significant and important to me and the situation that I've been in today.
The lyrics to said song can be found here:

<lj-cut text=""Hold On""><b>Hold On</b>
<i>by The Dustkickers</i>, 1997 from the album: ""twentythree""

Sitting on the front porch with my back turned toward the wind,
I'm looking forward to the chance of seeing your smile again.
And as I sit and think about the passing of these days,
On a stormy night in the fire and rain, 
When the wind blew out your flame . . . 

Hold on, hold on.
The light upon the stand shines out for all to see.
Hold on, hold on.
That light illuminates the dark surrounding me.

Turning through the pages of the life that I live here,
I'm struck by mystery of lives that disappear.
Well, the wind blows colder now, but the fire burns deep inside,
And I can see my way on a stormy night,
In the fire and rain when the wind calls out your name . . .

Hold on, hold on.
The light upon the stand shines out for all to see.
Hold on, hold on.
That light illuminates the dark surrounding me.

In my dreams, I still believe your light is there;
The wind has settled down and we've all taken care.
Then I awake to find reality's cold stare,
But there's a promise that the new day brings,
A song of hope that I can sing
Because the hands that heal my wounds
Surround me even now . . .

Hold on, hold on.
The light upon the stand shines out for all to see.
Hold on, hold on.
That light illuminates the dark surrounding me.
Hold on, hold on.
That light upon the stand shines out for all to see.
Hold on, hold on.
That light illuminates the dark surrounding me.

Sitting on the front porch with my back turned towards the wind,
I'm looking forward to the chance to see your smile again . . .</lj-cut>

I still don't know why I miss her, but I do.  Perhaps I'll never really know what impact she had on my life in that short time that we knew each other.  *shrugs, sighs*  But, knowing me, I'll be over it by tomorrow.  Heck, in an hour if I can help it ^__^

I'm fine.  Really."

"event","Wow.  It's been a long time since I've posted <i>anything,</i> let alone anything of substance.  Happy for the silence, people?  Gotten used to it?  Well, too bad, 'cause I've been so bored lately that I feel like I could post everyday from now on.  So, suck it up!  :P  Nah, just kidding.  I know that you all love me.  I mean, it <i>is</i> me, after all.  ^_^

So, to start off, thanks to <lj user=""emagnus""> for running into this one:

<a href=""http://quizilla.com/users/Squall19/quizzes/Which%20Suikoden%20True%20Rune%20Are%20You%20Compatible%20With%3F/""><img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/S/Squall19/1046117213_sSouleater.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Soul Eater""><br> <font size=""-1"">Which Suikoden True Rune Are You Compatible With?</font></a><BR> <font size=""-3"">brought to you by <a href=""http://quizilla.com"">Quizilla</a></font>

<i>You are most compatible with the Soul Eater. You have a lot of pain and sorrow inside of you, which at times may seem as though it is too much to bear. Even so, you never let it stop you, and press on in life. You have great abilities and talents, and as you were raised much was expected from you. You also have a sense of responsibility, both to your commitments and the people you care about, and will try to fulfill it regardless of your doubts and uncertainty. You probably wonder why your life turned out the way it did, and wish you could change something in it. The current owner of the Soul Eater is Tir McDohl. His best friend Ted, who had kept the rune for 400 years, asked him to take it so it could be protected from the Sorcerous Windy. After he aquired the rune, the destinies of the people closest to him were bent toward death, and the Soul Eater took the souls of Odessa, the leader of the Resistance, his loyal guardian and friend Gremio, his Father, and even Ted, who commanded the rune to take him, so he could be free from Windy's control, who had captured him. When Windy later tries to take the rune from Tir, the rune itself refuses her as its master, and stays with Tir and protects him from her power. After the war, Tir declined the role of leadership, and instead wandered the land with Gremio, who was revived with the power of the collective 108 Stars. The Rune is said to be cursed, and its motives and nature are unclear. Although it is clearly a burden to the bearer, Gremio remarks that he did not believe the rune itself was evil. Its true power is also uncertain, although Leknaat warned Tir never to use the full power of the rune.</i>

To which, I am not at all surprised.  Though, I was hoping for the Blue Moon Rune, Soul Eater really suits me, given the descritptions above and what people who truly know me can attest to.

Second, to those who do not have me on their MSN list - Heaven forbid it be so! - I would like to announce the revival of Pyrite, Dark Lord of the Negaverse!  This statement is relevant to a vast minority of you, but I would like it to have been declared to the LiveJournal community anyway.  However, to clarify, I received the necessary reference material for the Sailor Moon Role Playing Game, which I once had a character named Pyrite.  Pyrite was a pyromaniac whose sole goal was to ignite the entire Earth with the fires of his burning desire.  However, he was trapped in a state of limbo for over a year, now due to unforseen circimstances and he has been yammering on in my head and got along quite amicably with Gregor and Chichiro Frolov - no relation.  Now, he's found his Portal out of that place, and is currently looking for people to bring his godly wrath upon, so I have been ordered to make a call out to anyone who's reading this and who can make it to the K-W area on a weekly basis to give me a shout, if one is interested in joining a brand new SM:RPG campaign.

So, that's an update on my relevant life for you folks.  I hope that you enjoyed it.  Until next time, I'll see you later, space cowboy!"

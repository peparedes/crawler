"event","I have been stuck in my room for almost a week now, thanks to tonsillitis and a 103F fever that comes and goes, so it was only a matter of time before I got round to updating my LJ, I guess. Being sick and alone in a foreign country is really depressing - when you're sick, you want sympathy, right? Well, none of that here, folks. Soldier on! I am soldiering on (in bed) but my tonsils have gone a bit nuts and have almost closed my throat off completely -- I can only manage to swallow yoghurt and water so I've lost quite a bit of weight. 

Anyway, anyway. I signed and returned the contracts for the teaching job in Beijing, so I guess I'm going there in September. The contracts were a bit alarming: 'I vow to uphold the morals of the Chinese people' and 'I vow not to engage in religious activities unsuitable for an expert' and so on. I have no idea what that really means but apparently the govt. drafts all contracts for foreign experts so perhaps it's just an easy way to get rid of them if things get troublesome somehow.

Whilst in Tokyo this time I have been on a couple of nice trips, albeit rather touristy for once. I drove (yes, me behind the wheel) to Nikkou with my friend Tomo, whose dad provided us with a room and dinner at his nice member's club. I was tricked into believing that for the equivalent of 25 quid you could get a nice room with a view, all day access to three open air hot springs along with a six course dinner and all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet. When I sneaked a peek the ACTUAL bill I felt rather embarrassed, but that's Japanese hospitality for you.

Nikkou is famous predominantly for its huge shrine complex, Toshougu, which includes the famous hear/see/speak-no-evil monkeys and the crying dragon (which is a sumi-e drawing of a dragon on the ceiling such that if you stand exactly underneath its face and clack two wooden blocks together, the acoustics conspire to make a mad shrieking call. Nice crowd-pleaser.) There's also a big fat cat whose eyes never stop following you, 5-story pagoda, 100 odd colourful and architecturally interesting buildings covered in the Tokugawa crests etc. etc.  But I find shrine complexes quite tedious without knowing the historical context. But it's worth going for the dragon and explanation of the Japanese / Chinese zodiac that comes with it.

The town of Nikkou itself is on the shore of a fairly big lake surrounded by an array of tall mountains rich in iron-ore deposits (the tallest mountain is roughly twice the height of Snowdon). There are also a couple of large waterfalls, but the extensive tourist-orientated constructions take them out of their natural setting (e.g. a lift going down through 100 meters of bedrock so that you can look at the waterfall from the bottom via a gaudy white platform with giftshop). 

Slightly further afield from the lake is an expanse of extremely bio-diverse moorland, quite unusual in Japan, over several kilometers of which two tracks of raised planks have been lain (with occasional three-lane sections for overtaking / popular areas), so that you can get out and about over the boggy bits and explore four of five distinct environments all within about 20 minutes of each other. Definitely worth doing. The main place is called 'akanuma' which means 'red moor', essentially, thanks to the iron ore naturally turning most of the rivers in the area a sort of industrial orange colour.

As for food, the famous thing you're supposed to eat is 'yuba-dofu', a kind of tofu which tastes very malty. Most people associate this with Kyoto but apparently it originated in Nikkou thanks to the super pure water. We had it with soba and udon, in both tempura form and raw form. Very nice.

The following day, I dragged Tomo up into the mountains to visit a farm and we milked some cows and played with some sheep. There wasn't all that much to do there, though. Didn't justify the size of advertisement in the brochures! However, the view from the winding mountain passes and a massive, unexpected bridge at 2300 feet was pretty spectacular.  Which reminds me, since Nikkou is in a valley high in the mountains, entering and leaving that area is similarly interesting, as you negotiate 48 consecutive hairpin bends (the 'irohazaka', named after the 48 characters of the old japanese syllabrary), ascending about half the height of Snowdon by the end of it. 

The other trip was to Yokohama, a fairly unattractive coastal town which has a day-trip's worth of things to see. The first is the fantastic museum inside a large art-deco Japanese passanger liner that used to sail between the US and Tokyo pre- and post-WWII. It's all been preserved as it used to be, with minimal intrusions, and you can see exactly how the different classes spent their time on the ship (down to the level of exactly what they ate for every meal on a particular trip, hour-by-hour breakdowns of their daily activities etc.) and the general feeling is that almost no interesting detail has been left unmentioned. It also pointed out that the cost for a pair of first-class cabins (very nice and stately) was 1000 yen -- the same price as a house in Tokyo. I wanted to know the third-class rate too (where people slept 8 to a room and helped out the cabin crew with their chores), but that alone remained a mystery. (Actually, another mystery was the presence of a 24-hour on-board post-office.)

As for other attractions, Yokohama offers the largest Chinatown in Japan -- it really is huge, but it is also entirely uniform and uninspiring. Every shop sells either a) chestnuts, b) dumplings, c) chinese food (all with the same range of set meals), d) stuffed panda toys, e) fortune telling or f) outrageously expensive orientalist tat like carpets and rosewood tables. Moved swiftly on.

The area is almost famous for being the place where Perry and his black ships dropped anchor at the beginning of the Meiji period and so there are quite a few foreign buildings dotted around, (including an ""English house"" that looks like a porta-kabin with a roof and concrete chimneys bolted on, surrounded by a veritable Valentine's day-full of exotic rose beds). But it's better than 'French Mountain', which has at its peak nothing but a burnt down ruin of the former French Embassy. This made me laugh for hours. 

Apart from that, there have been the usual odd experiences. The best one was helping a 93-year old class B war criminal (who worked in china during the occupation for the japanese military police and sent chinese soldiers off for vivisection experiments) wrap up my leftover rice in a restaurant so that he could take it home to feed the pigeons in his garden. I've also been giving talks to future summer school students about what to expect, and will play golf with the head of Nichidai's international office somewhere near Mt Fuji. So nothing very electrifying, really. But whether you read this or not, I'm one hour closer towards health now!

Hope you're all having fun.

PS Unlikely music recommendation! http://www.myspace.com/ericwhitacre  <--- this is the kind of music I really enjoy. It's an odd fusion of classical, choral, anime sound track, etc. etc.   When his musical 'Paradise Lost' opens in the UK it'll be a big hit, I'm sure, so you heard it here first folks."

"event","Well, it's been a long time, MONTHS even, but here we are again writing in Livejournal. I don't think anyone reads this anymore but just in case, I'm saying 'hello', so you should say 'hello' back. And more.

Recently I returned to Tokyo, having previously returned to the UK. My flight back here was somewhat surprising -- I was supposed to be transiting in Sri Lanka, but there was no flight from Sri Lanka to Tokyo. Instead, after I badgered the staff for a while, they sent me to the Maldives to get a flight from there. Very strange. Stranger still was the fact that the airport sold paper made out of elephant dung under the banner 'CONVERSAVTION THROUGH INNOVATION: BECAUSE EXTINCT IS FOREVER'. I think there's some question mark about the economies of rearing herds of elephants purely for their dung, but perhaps paper is one of the valuable hot commodities in cheap land-adled, cheap food-adled Sri Lanka? Seems unlikely.

Well, I am going to have dinner with the British Ambassador on Monday, as one does. I'm taking a Japanese guy from Sophia University who is perhaps one of the best networkers I've ever met and intends to work for the Diet. His earnestness is unparalleled and he always invites me to cultural events where he can meet new people. I'm really bad at networking -- all I do is lose people's businesscards and get their names wrong -- so it's good to be in the presence of someone who knows how to do it!

I got a job offer to work in a University in Beijing -- it's the top technical university in China, sort of an aeronautics/aerospace place full of PILOTS and SPACE SHIPS and so on (I imagine), but since Beijing is absolutely massive, chocked full of pollution and cramstuffed with people, I'm not sure whether to say yes or not. To be honest, it's very likely that I will say yes, because learning Chinese might be quite nice AND AND AND I can go to North Korea AND get the Trans-Mongolian Express to Ulaan Baatar for just 90 quid! Armenian Gun Runners use that train! But I suppose I should think of a better justification before sending the contract back.

Also, don'ttellanyonebut I am currently engaged in DUBIOUS PRACTICES with someone who works at the reception desk of a hotel. I think it's basically all to do with my fantasy of living in a Murakami Haruki novel, but anyway. It's fun. I like to TRANSGRESS SOCIAL BOUNDARIES. Who doesn't. It had to be done at some point in life. SECRET!

But but, more seriously, I also took someone on a three day trip to Yorkshire and the castles of North Wales before I came back to Japan. We stayed at a farm on Anglesey with a crazy old lady (73) who would drop everything (including breakfast) in order to break out into the show tunes with which she once entertained the Chinese fleets off the coast of Hong Kong. She also had a fantastic blind assistant whose principle job was to lay the table for breakfast -- well, you can imagine how successful that was! Anyway, my touring partner and I got on very well. We visited the South Stacks lighthouse late in the evening and it was all deserted and romantic. We played hide and seek in Canaerfon Castle and actually lost each other for two hours. We also got lost at night on the country lanes trying to find the farm, which was fine for me, being quite used to country lanes, but rather vomit-inducing for PERSON X since they are best-described as a city-dweller unaccustomed to not being able to see what's coming round the next bend. I thought this was quite endearing. Anyway, they are now in Turkey with some Turkish family (despite not being Turkish) and I am waiting for them to HURRY UP and come to Japan so that we can go to Russia together.

Lastly, I REVAMPED the garden, including the use of a MIDI DIGGER to flatten what was once a large hill (: D!!!) followed by the laying of a long path and the sowing of a wild-flower meadow. I also imported a collection of rare Himalayan flowering gingers which look a bit like alien beings from space. They're going to go in amongst the buttercups and daisies to add a sense of OMINOUSNESS to proceedings. I also bought a giant 6ft stone obelisk (I've ALWAYS wanted one!!!!) and covered it in yoghurt to encourage moss.

At the moment I'm also reviewing a couple of philosophy books for a magazine and the Institute of Ideas. I'll post the link here when it's done. Some of you may be SO EXCITED that your bottom jaw will hang limp and your cornflakes will tumble like cultural snow onto your gaping, hungry, grateful lap. Maybe. God I'm so hungry. I've been trying to cook toast all day using the microwave but all I managed to do was melt six candles that I'd left sitting on top of it. I can't move them now -- they're sort of welded to the top. Why don't microwaves cook toast?!

Well, okay, I'm going to go to the station to pick up half a dozen high school girls who are coming round to teach me how to cook various Japanese dishes that they like. : D  PS SUPER TASTY GRAPEFRUITS ARE SO CHEAP AT THE MOMENT AUGHHHH WHAT WILL I DO WITH MYSELF I DON'T KNOW *STUFFS FACE RELENTLESSLY* Also big boxes of Dorset Cereals for 398 yen is almost worth a poem.

First, the Guardian found his Oxford profile through a girl called Phillipa Neal.

And the AFP had a good look at all the groups about him.
http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/pakistanbhuttosoninternetoffbeat

And then The Mail found a picture of him dressed like a devil on Hallowe'en, which was widely published.

Then some jerk called Tonay made a fake profile with fake quotes that were picked up by press everywhere.
e.g. http://www.dnaindia.com/mobile/report.asp?n=1142724

Now Bhutto's party are trying to claim that this was the Pakistani Govt. trying to undermine Bilawal.

And so it goes on. Can't people just leave it? A few of my friends are now starting to panic and are ditching people they don't trust in droves."

"event","I may yet apply for the JET scheme, you know, now that I'm now doing a TEFL course in London. I've found the perfect school... it's on a tiny island with 2000 inhabitants 1300km from mainland Japan. It takes 25.5 hours to get there by boat and there's no airport. So if you get sick, the military have to rescue you. I'm really quite excited by the idea. I could learn to fish and look after the marine turtles.

Quite out of the blue, the Japanese Cultural Secretary has invited me to dinner at his house in Westminster next Friday. I feel like a bit of a fraud (being unemployed and not really of any significance to anyone), but I'm going anyway. The only downside is that he added 'I'm looking forward to meeting your wife', which raises issues several. (Anyone want to be a wife for an evening? No? Oh well.)

But for now I'm just going to wait for <i>Spooks</i> to come on, even though it clashes with Cerys and <i>I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here</i>. I'm really addicted to <i>Spooks</i>. I even bought (for the first time in years) a load of DVDs yesterday - the first two seasons.

<lj-cut text=""Funtime Grammar Clarification"">

<b>1) Correct the following...</b>

a) 
I'd like some informations about your courses.
Here you go.

b) 
Have you got any money? 
Yes, I've been to the bank yesterday.

c) 
Is John ill? He's lost a lot of weight. 
Yes, he's looking rather slender, isn't he.

d) 
Why didn't you answer the telephone?
Because I had a bath.

<b>2) How would you explain the above mistakes to someone learning English?</b>

<b>3) What is the difference in meaning in the following sentences? How could you help an English learner appreciate the differences?</b>

a) 
i) If I had the money, I'd buy a new car.
ii) If I have the money, I'll buy a new car.

b)
i) The house was very isolated.
ii) The house was very secluded.

c)
i) Give me a hand with this bag, will you?
ii) Would you give me a hand with this bag, please?

<b>4) Write 300 words about a positive learning experience you've had.</b>

</lj-cut>

Just got trick-or-treated by a bunch of kids dressed as spiders. Very cute but demanding. I could only give them four walnuts and a KitKat each which did not go down well. 

The Japanese Embassy invited me to a symposium and reception next week on <i>The Tale of Genji</i>, which looks quite interesting.

I've also made the snap decision to take part in NaNoWriMo, although the kind of book I want to write will take far too much researching to get done in a month. So I'll write something more straightforward just to see how it goes. It says you have to tell everyone you're doing it so that the fear of personal humiliation will motivate you to actually get it done -- I'm a firm believer in this kind of tactic so let's go!"

"event","I've moved house. I'm now living on my own in a small village in Suffolk, about 8 miles north of Bury St Edmunds. The house is a tiny 250 year old cottage. The ceilings are about 6 ft 3'' (like me), with head-crunching exposed beams; there's no oven in the kitchen (it's outside in a shed behind a rocking horse) and the stairs are, for whatever reason, not in the house but in a summer house in the garden down the road, necessitating a ladder. It's a slightly strange arrangement -- somewhere between a house and a tent -- but it suits me just fine. Even if I do have to put a plank down to use the toilet (the bathroom is sort of lacking in floor).

It used to be owned by gypsies. Next door is a former bassist from Motorhead (now writing books and plays with the intention of becoming an author) and on the other side is a 48-year-old lady called Leanne who has a 28-year-old bit of stuff from Cuba called Turbo (and let's hope that's a name and not a description or I'll never get any sleep -- stud partition ain't exactly soundproof). She's yet to get him through customs, though.

I got a scholarship to study Japanese in Tokyo for three months from January. Meanwhile, I'm applying for graduate jobs that start next September. I'll also be studying for a CELTA qualification in Covent Garden from the end of November (during which time I'll live in Highgate). So just like usual I'm living out of a suitcase."

9) Voldemort's hand was trembling on the elder wand and Harry gripped Draco's very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away.
10) Voldemort's chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.

"event","Well, so, 2nd round interview was okay but not great - no idea whether I'm going to get through to the next round or not but should find out in the next couple of days. Lots of top quality people although some were a bit rah. The girls were quite nice and there was one cute guy who had really weird earrings - sort of loops the size of rings inside his earlobes. Looked almost tribal, but he was white and skinny.

Japanese Embassy was also fun - I talked to the secretary for culture and a British chap called Simon who was the most useful person since sliced bread. Saturday I interviewed another dozen people or so for designer / composer / other positions and my friend Daisy (who directed the German tour) had a Victoriana party in the evening, so cravattes all round. Going on a kind of is-it-isn't-it date with a guy called Peter (not the rubbish one) who I haven't seen for about two years (er, as it was with the other Peter -- in fact the parallels with the rubbish Peter are rather endless so I hope this one's a bit better. I think 95% of the guys I've fancied have either been called Dan or Peter.) 

Yesterday I went to formal with the whole crew + half the cast for the Japan tour, which was good except for the fact that one of the cast has a serious attention-seeking problem so he made a total fool of himself. His energy will have to be harnessed.

Tonight Alastair Campbell came to Pembroke and the Master invited me to go for a drink with them both (and a few fellows and other grads) but I got distracted by someone else whose son is high up in ANA and might be able to hook us up with cheaper flights. Woohoo. Handed in a draft of my corporate responsibility essay today. (Although it's just not looking great...)

Anyway, I'm SO TIRED. I want term to end so I can be a normal human being again. I have to go to the docs tomorrow and then they're sending me to an ENT specialist when I have time because something's wrong with my throat. ;_;

And I'm really worried about Helen. Really worried. arghhhhhhhh."

"event","Typically surreal weekend. Yesterday I had lunch with two profs from Seikei, one of whom was this ace 30/40-something guy with long hair and a full length trenchcoat (collar up) who specialises in Jazz influences in American Literature (and, it turned out, has drunk with Murakami on a number of occasions - jealous). Anyway, result was that our tour should be visiting there on the 21st/22nd.

Then Helen came up from London and gave me a proof of her new book 'The Opposite House' which seems a bit darker and more surreal (and generally more mature) than TIG. I'm actually a bit surprised by how good it is so far (given that she was writing about Cuba without ever having been there). She also gave me a little black fish keyring that was made by a Kenyan lady. It's cute as buttons. : D She's starting writing her third book about a racist house next week.

Then I had dinner and went to see the Seafarer (transferred from the National) with Prof Mellor, my aesthetics supervisor and two Egyptology Profs who seemed to think I ran a catering business (adding to the growing sense of anonymity I have for having achieved nothing of any substance on my own merits). Production was excellent: drunking Irishmen stumbling around telling narratives and urinating themselves for 45 minutes before a Faustian bargain from 25 years ago crops up and the devil has one chap's soul on the line in a game of poker. Awesome. But as usual hell was characterised as That Place where No-One Loves You, Not Even God which I found quite upsetting somehow.

Today I'm trying to finish one of these goddamn essays and I'm having teacakes with another MPhil student who is a technofeminist and doesn't wear matching pairs of shoes. I'm not sure if I respect this in him or not. Probably I do. Why not."

The third round, if I make it, is interviews with the board of trustees. I did a bit of research and I don't think there could be a more intimidating list of people:

Nick Clegg (MP)
The Lady Adrian (wife of a former master of Pembroke)
Masahiro Dozen (president of Daiwa securities)
Lord Broers FREng FRS (former Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, made a Life Baron by the Queen)
The Lord Carrington KG (former foreign secretary, advisor to six PMs, former secretary-general of NATO)
Christopher Everett CBE
Hiroaki Fujii (former Japanese Ambassador to the UK)
Prof Sir John Gurdon FRS (head of Wellcome Institute at Cambridge, first guy to clone anything back in the 60s)
Yoshinari Hara (chairman of Daiwa Securities)
Merryn Somerset Webb (editor of Moneyweek)
Sir John Whitehead GCMG CVO (former UK Ambassador to Japan)

"event","I am just about finished with my essay on the aesthetics of nature. Now I'm starting another sexy one on organisations. It's a bit like the animal rights issue but applied to corporations (which I think are more interesting from a metaphysical point of view - they're easily shown to be sentient beings with distinct mental properties from their members, which is quite freaky when you think about it). Anyway, under US and UK law, corporations are treated as individuals (in parallel with the way persons are treated). But this is a dubious framework, because it's not clear that the mental lives of corporations and the mental lives of people are analogous. So having established how strong the analogy is, I'll try and work out what normative considerations should be read off the metaphysics and look at whether that really gives a solid philosophical foundation for the legal rights they have under the law.

Japan Tour is progressing slowly. We now have a full cast as of this week. I have about 20K in sight for funding although we've only got about 10.5K so far. Venues are being slow as any plans presented to Japanese institutions have endless committees to get through. A lady from the RSC called Thelma Holt is helping us to get a professional venue in central Tokyo. The Japanese Ambassador is coming in April for a photoshoot with us. For the 17 days of the tour we've booked ourselves into a fantastic little pastel multi-coloured toytown near Yoyogi Park (next to Harajuku) which is there specially to provide cheap accommodation for youth groups. 

Met the head of the BBC's natural-history dept. last week. Nice guy. He's going to help me get David Attenborough to come and talk at Pembroke. Or so he said. I like David Attenborough so I'm well up for that.

Had a Round 1 Daiwa interview last Tuesday which did not go particularly well. I'm not tremendously hopeful that I'll be invited back for round 2 but I find out tomorrow or Wednesday. If I don't get to go to Japan for two years I'll just cry though, because I don't have any other immediate plans."

"event","The Canon Mini-DV Cam did not come with a cable to connect it to the computer, despite including video editing software. It also came with instructions in French, German and Italian but not English. This follows on from a delivery to my sister two days ago of an HP Printer which did not include a USB cable to connect it to the computer. Both companies said these cables were optional (OPTIONAL! What else are you going to do with a printer!?) and required a CABLE UPGRADE of several hundred pounds plus expedited shipping by military jet from Papua New Guinea.

What annoyed me MOST of all though was the structure of the conversation which went EXACTLY like this:

Me: ""My printer arrived today but it doesn't include a USB cable. Can you send me one please?""
Woman in broken English: ""Have you visited our customer support website?""
Me: ""No, I don't want support I just want a cable.""
Woman in broken English: ""Are you aware of our customer support website?""
Me: ""Well no, but...""
Woman in broken English: ""Our customer support website is located at hp.com/whatever.asp and has a lot of information about the product or service you have purchased.""
Me: ""Good, but I still want a cable.""
Woman in broken English: ""Most customer problems can be resolved using the help database on our website.""
Me: ""Cable! Cable! Cable! Cable! You can't download a USB cable!""
Woman in broken English: ""I don't understand your problem. Let me transfer you to our retail department.""
Me: ""AAAAAAAAAAAAA. ANGRY FACE.""
Smooth Retail Man in Northern Accent: ""Blah blah blah how can we help?""
Me: ""My printer arrived today but it doesn't include a USB cable. Can you send me one please?""
Man: ""Oh, actually, our printers don't come with USB cables anymore.""
Me: ""Well they did the last time.""
Man: ""Yes, we don't supply them. New policy. They're now optional extras. I can sell you one for 6 pounds plus shipping.""
Me: ""Isn't this like selling someone a coat without buttons?""
Man: ""Err, well... actually, you know, if you go to a large Tesco you can buy one for a lot less.""
Me: ""Oh. Well, thanks for your honesty.""
Man: ""Yeah our prices are... Oh god... OH GOD NO!!! *sound of whirring and screaming*""
Automated Voice: ""Your call has been placed in a queue and will be answered by the System shortly.""
Me: *hang up*

Since then a strange symbol has appeared on the palm of my hand and the cat has been vomiting green blood and asking us in very formal language if she mightn't trouble us for some rotisserie fried chicken. Odd place, Lincolnshire.

"event","Okay! SO I spent New Years in leafy Highgate having a venison dinner. This was widely considered fun by all, although I was upset not to get down to the Thames to see the fireworks. Then we spent New Year's Day wandering around on Hampstead Heath in formal attire, which became muddy and slidey as we slipped and groped our way balefully amongst the swales and tors. 

New Year started badly, with my friend's toilets backing up at 8am, and me getting fined 50 quid on the way home for failing to produce a Young Person's Railcard. I was desperately tired and not in the mood for arsey GNER man so I probably got what I deserved from a karma point of view. Nonetheless, my first complaint letter of the year went off this morning (following rapidly on from one to Liberty for selling me a salt and pepper set that completely fails to achieve its sole purpose - the salt just pours out of it whether you want it to or not!) One thing a philosophy degree gives you is the ability to write cast-iron complaints letters. 

Today I punched two new holes in my belts because I have somehow lost more weight and am now even thinner than ever (37-29-37 sounds nice but is quite unhealthy for someone who's 6 foot 4). I also got my father a Mini-DV cam for his birthday present. He's sixty this week. The camera was already half price but I got another ten percent and some free tat, the function of which I can't identify. Haggling is the new black.

Anyway, resolutions: 
1) don't worry, don't take things so seriously 
2) just get on with it 
3) be spontaneous, have fun
4) don't take any shit from anyone
5) go to more exciting countries 
6) dress smart, think smart -- replacing ties with cravattes for formal occasions where possible
7) haggle for everything over twenty quid
8) be more confident
9) go to more social events 
10) talk to more people in german

Okay, let's do it!"

"event","So I went to London for a couple of days and had a great time. So many fun things happened.

- Party in The Shunt (members club in the vaults under London Bridge station)
- Riding the ponies in Leicster Square with Heather, followed by christmas shopping. (I got my mother some hot pink kitchen scales and <a href=""http://www.eu.forzieri.com/usa/product_view.asp?l=usa&c=gbr&iwsid=&pf_id=al38473-003&dept_id=71&id_valore1=&id_valore2=66&id_valore3=&id_valore4=&id_valore5=&source=shopusuk&listid=1x"">these</a> lovely salt and pepper shakers from Liberty).
- Making a <a href=""http://cambridge.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2079734&l=c2f86&id=36903846"">Castle Cake</a>(!) with Heather and playing on it with Lord of the Rings board game characters
- Meeting Helen and giving her the cake gatehouse as a belated birthday present. She ditched her agent of three years and has now moved to the Wylie agency, which is a big move for her.
- Finding out college were refunding a large part of my US expenses since they agreed they had misled me.
- Going to Selfridges and spending a large part of that refund on a 1/250 limited edition pink-pinstripe suit with buttons made from laser etched horn! It just fitted so perfectly I'd probably have been mad not to buy it! Anyway, despite there being no sale on, I got the biggest discount you could imagine. I spent one hour chatting with the staff and got to know them all really well - unfortunately, my really quite normal questions gave them all existential crises because it turned out they were all at the age (~28) where they had to settle into careers and they were just avoiding the fact that retail was not the career they wanted. One, a former builder from Bromley, was trying to get into event management; the manager, from Johannesberg, hated how rude customers were and how many targets he had to meet, but didn't have a diverse enough CV to get out of men's fashion; the third guy (a tailor of Hong Kong extraction) had done a degree in photography, and wanted to get into a career in image and image manipulation, but couldn't take the risk to get out of retail. This last guy was super-lovely. But by the end of it they were all so depressed that they gave me 300 pounds off the suit, and a free 75 pound pink shirt, and some free silver cufflinks! And I got the Hong Kong guy's phone number.

Anyway, yesterday I went to an antique's fair and bought my sister her present (four mugs) and today I'm going to a pub near Gainsborough for lunch with my second mum. Then the day after that I'm going to Chatsworth House to hang out with a vet who works there, who is quite pretty and wants to teach me how to milk a cow."

"event","Having gone and returned, Cambridge is totally different from before, but just as cold. The major plus point is that I have an oven, and I have so far made a fruitcake, jam tarts, a devil's food cake and a carrot cake. (The latter being best.) Philosophy MPhil and German Diploma are going quite well although I still haven't found the German assistant in college who does the oral practice - it's apparently quite a feat to miss her because she's ubiquitous and has shock-red hair. Another Pembroke Grad studying History has dragged me into the CU United Nations Association, as he's editing their magazine but doesn't know much about the UN. The society seems to consist of 95% Hong Kong students and 5% other ethnicities, but they seem to have a sense of irony - e.g. our anti-poverty black tie 3-course dinner with pledge to the Queen in Latin. Nonetheless, I'm going to help them get some speakers if I can.

I'm currently under some mild excitement because I got asked if I'd do the Philosophy undergraduate admissions interviews for one of the colleges. It seems quite surreal that there are people out there paying cold hard cash to be coached through an interview that involves them talking to me. There's a course in a fortnight or so that tells me all the key skills -- although I'm not sure whether two admin staff are going to know best about how to be a good philosophy interviewer. They've lumped our session together with History of Art and Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, amongst others, which I wouldn't have thought constituted (prima facie at least) a set of subjects that required the same abilities and thus the same interview techniques. But we'll see what they say. 

Oh, and guess who asked me how I was doing the other day? Digeridoos, mate! Rolf Harris! He was in college qua host of a TV documentary on Bill Oddie's life, so we had a quick chat as he was frogmarched from one court to the next."

Therefore, I want to go <a href=""http://www.kamchatkapeninsula.com/visit.html"">HERE</a>! The idea of being airlifted to a tiny reindeer herding community in an old soviet transport is rather appealing, especially when it's 200 miles from anywhere on an active volcanic plateau that's 3000m above sea level and full of highly explosive geysers...!!! And TUNDRA!!! Ever since I flew to Japan and stared out of the window at dusk and saw nothing but desolate, unending tundra in every direction I've wanted to go. Getting lost would have no meaning in a place like that! You can't get lost when there's nothing to go to! Apparently, some of the nomadic farming communities in these areas go nuts from watching the movement of the sun, and they drop their hoes and they walk west until they die miserable and alone. It's quite a place.

Utterly unrelated, it just occurred to me that ever since floppy disks, hardware marketing has used a decimal version of bytes rather than the binary one. 1.44 MB (decimal) is in fact only 1.4 MB (binary) because it's 1,440,000 bytes. So when you get that ""100 GB"" hard drive, you're really only getting about 93 GB (binary). 7 GB marketed out of nothing! It's a scandal, just like everything else. 

It's the same con as you get with monitors - 19 inch, for example, is usually the diagonal measurement before they put the screen in the casing. So out with the ruler next time."

"event","I never really wrote about the summer school. It was markedly different from previous ones - the boys were all sex-mad. 

One boy actually introduced himself with a confession that the first person he had had sex with was his cram-school teacher, when he was 17, whilst in the house of her then boyfriend, no less, who also happened to be his Maths supervisor. He still meets up with her for secret rendez-vous apparently. But he and I got on really well after he realised he didn't need to impress me with his sexploits - he emails me every day now. But in case you care, the second person he slept with was some girl he met in a rental karaoke room (they had to do it 'riding style' due to space constraints but at least it was cheaper than going to a Love Hotel).

So they say Romance is dead, but it isn't. Here's another story. Several of the participants were much older than any we'd had before - some were in their 30s doing Masters courses (in this case, Children's Literature) whilst one lady was 47 and a housewife - she'd saved from her part time job for ten years to come to the UK.  But there was even one retired man (63) who used to work for a watch company. At 11pm one night, I met him by chance outside Pembroke's front gate. He happened to be in the company of two construction workers of burly physique, clutching some beer. I asked what was going on, and it turned out they'd met in the Bath House (pub) and the two workmen had brought the old man some drinks and taken him on a two-and-a-half hour tour of town. How nice, I commented, that the old man could meet some local people. Where did they go on the tour? To see the whale at the Downing site and the Millpond, it transpired. This made me raise an eyebrow because it takes 2 mins to get to the whale, and 5 minutes to get to the Millpond. Yet the tour was apparently two-and-a-half hours. 

But before I could ask the obvious, one worker started licking the old man's face. 

Without drawing attention to this new and frankly rather frightening development, I took the old man inside and bid the men adieu. The next day, I asked the old man if he'd be seeing his new friends again. ""Oh,"" he said happily, ""my pub lovers!""

Actually, I won't write about the other major sex-related stories, which included a session of strip jenga and an invitation from one boy to a group masturbation session (at the end of a conversation about whether he had any pets). Boy: ""That guy won last time"" *cheerfully points to a shy boy who waves unabashed* ""1 minute 20 seconds!""

My conclusion is that we can all find happiness somewhere, be it in a cram-school, a karaoke bar, in group masturbation sessions in a youth hostel, or by a Millpond with two workmen you just picked up at a pub. There's really something for everyone on a Pembroke summer school."

I really quite liked the first episode, even though it had a crappy sort of cyber-UI on all the computers (which is a pet hate), and too many shit plot devices. But second episode was middling to poor and generally rubbish, although the riot was pretty well thought out. Third episode, given that it features the word thermobaric in the trailer, does not look like it will set our faces to stun. It sounds like something one of the many security-obsessed US foundations would make a presentation about. Ooh look what happens if you smuggle a nuclear device out of Russia and try and blow it up in inner-city London! Isn't it terrible?!

I took the Waseda kids to Snowdonia,  London, Saffron Walden etc. then went with Mitsuru and his adorable girlfriend Miwa to Oxford, Bath, the Cotswolds, Flamborough Head, Robin Hood's Bay, Scarborough, and the Yorkshire Moors (to see the Harry Potter railway). Miwa has a child-like simplicity that's really quite amazing. She was pouncing on crickets at the Flamborough lighthouse. Anyway, I think I must have driven about 15 hours in total over the last couple of days and I am really rather tired.

I'm off to Brighton on Wednesday with Topheles and Shilov to visit Kai, with a brief stop in Acton to have coffee with a Thai boy who claims to be my brother.

Oh, and I've decided that if I'm going to try and get a Daiwa scholarship thing, then I will suggest my year's placement be with the British Council. Its Tokyo office is near to Akihabara so I could live in Kichijouji (nice area) without it being too much faff.

Less thrillingly, according to the doctor, my mum's lungs (emphysema) have about five years left, assuming she doesn't get any chest infections etc.  I don't know what that means more generally, but it's probably best not to think about it."

Shockingly, we actually won the pub quiz which we never ever did during our school years. One of the questions was ""Who invented the refrigeration process in 1925?"" We thought we'd be hilarious and put down ""Captain Birdseye"". This was, unbelievably, the right answer - Captain Clarence Birdseye was culprit. The only three I knew that the others didn't involved political geography or royalty - which US state has the place with the world's highest rainfall (Hawaii), which flag is saffron white and green with a wheel in the middle (India), and a picture question: what number in line is this person for the British throne? (12th - Viscount Linley) But all the stuff about like films and music and football and crap I hadn't got a clue. It transpired that one of Helen's friends slept with Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Velvet Goldmine etc.) - he has a small penis and is not good in bed, if you want to be disabused of any fantasies. 

Helen and Morgan are coming over tomorrow and we're going to take the boat out for a spin on the pond and then head into Brigg for a Chinese and drinking fun. The last time I went to Brigg with Morgan, we ended up swapping trousers on the pavement outside a pizza place, and stealing someone's pumpkins. So could be good. Nothing quite like old friends."

"event","Right, so, Edinburgh was fun - Cerys Matthews gig was amazingly good, and I got to chat with her for about 10 minutes afterwards before she disappeared with her kids. I got one of the roadies to give me a copy of the playlist, so she and the piano player (an absolute legend of a nutcase from America called Ben Atkins) signed it for me. Another girl, an even bigger fan than I am, was practically crying because she couldn't get her camera to work, so I made Rik take a picture for her with mine for subsequent emailing. So we got chatting, and if anyone remembers a Melody Maker article which described how Cerys had a pair of knickers thrown at her during a performance of Ballad of Tom Jones (and tampons thrown at her during a performance of She's A Millionaire), this was the girl that threw them. 

Cerys' support was a guy called Richard James (which seemed quite suitable to Rik and I), who we later met wandering lost and drunken around the streets outside the Underbelly. We had a chat with him whilst leading him to the Three Sisters pub, and it turns out he used to be part of Gorky's Zygotic Mynci (another Welsh group that produced a few good tracks).

The next day, I met up with Kyla (awesome fullname: Kyla Gimmel Bowen-la Grange), who I reckon must officially be the world's most desirable person to have as a girlfriend - stunningly attractive, amazing voice, very intelligent (she's a philosophy student at Pembroke hehe), ultra-nice, and very obviously destined for a career as a singer-songwriter. In fact, you can listen to her demo stuff on her MySpace <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/kylabowenlagrange"">here</a>. (Live recordings.) We had a good old natter about how Pembroke was last year and she ranted about some of the Christian philosophers ruining the Immoral Sciences Club.

Rik (22) and Rowan (21) are getting a mortgage on a property out in a village near Edinburgh, which is pretty cool. I'm well impressed by how mature and domestic they are. They've been living together for ages now with their two dogs, Arran and Lewis. I want domesticity!

My new no-hair seems to attract more people than the old hair. I got chatted up in the Underbelly toilets by one of the staff (a quite nice guy also called James) - and I think I liked him all the more because he was chatting away unembarrasedly whilst standing in his underwear trying to get a load of glue off his trousers. Someone else tried to pick me up ten minutes later - a drunken transvestite with a faux-Morningside accent. When she came over and started feeling me up in the bar at 11am, I thought she must have been advertising a play. But the smeared make-up, collapsing wig and drunken staggering in heels eventually proved she wasn't. Nonetheless, I wasn't very well able to get up and leave without seeming somewhat closed-minded (and she was quite fun to talk to) -- however, who should happen in to the bar at that point that a whole load of my friends from Pembroke! Initial excitement that they hadn't seen me for two years and shock at my lack of hair turned into awkward feet-shuffling and oh-is-that-the-time-we'd-best-be-going-really excuses as they realised I was having my thigh groped by a man in a wig. God knows what they think of me now.

Anyway, irrespective of all that, I got my MPhil funding from the AHRC, so I'm back at Cam again next year. Since the maintenance stipend they give is more than generous, I rewarded myself by re-upgrading my phone to the SonyEricsson K800i (with free Sky TV on it for a month ohohohoho). It doesn't come with a memory card, though, which sucks a bit.

I also got a letter from Pembroke asking me to write a few articles for a big 50-year historical perspective on what's happened to Pembroke since the war. Sounds fun, except the co-ordinator for the articles doesn't have email! I can't believe it! 

PS IP's Leyla has disappeared ""on indefinite leave""! Hurrah!"

"event","Ooh, my bro-in-law's first interview using a presentation I made for him resulted in a job offer! *happy happy*  His first in 108 applications! (That's no reflection on his abilities - it's just that his age is now a perennial problem.) Anyway, this job would involve giving the British Deer Society an image makeover. We had some great slides showing exactly how the structure of the image would look, the clarity of which they loved according to this letter. *contributed!* *excited!* etc.

Anyway, this job's alright but he really wants one of the other jobs we made presentations for, so wait-and-see.

Less good news: while I was in Japan, I gave a half-hour presentation to a bunch of high school students and teachers about what to expect from their summer school at Pembroke this year. It was the first one for that particular institution so no-one had any idea what to expect and I was 'first contact' or whatever you want to call it. The presentation went well enough, but I got text messages from the TAs today telling me that the school has been a disaster, thanks to, they claim, the total ineptitude of one of the IP staff who'd been in charge of running it. (There was a lot of controversy over her appointment in the first place because there was strong evidence that she'd exploited students on a previous summer school when working as a language teacher. I haven't anything positive to say about her - in response to my emails asking what she'd like mentioned in the presentation, I got nothing, so I phoned her. She came up with some meaningless waffle on the spot, and said she'd send me an email the next day. And then forgot.) Anyway, I'm not pleased because the institution in question may now associate me with this particular programme.

But I was also told that one of the other (non-inept) staff in IP is leaving, so there's a vacancy coming up........"

"event","Had a nicely international selection of emails today. The best one was from a friend at the UN who's overseeing all the Lebanon chatter - but rather than talk about that, he went on about how he had to be the best man in a Japanese wedding and attached some pictures of his friend Jane Goodall (of talking monkeys fame) getting the Legion d'Honneur earlier in the year. People have such exciting lives. 

Also got emails from two new Japanese people and my language professor from Oxy who I'd turned into a Murakami fan. Pembroke's IP also emailed to say they wanted some bears sourcing wearing T-shirts with Pembroke's crest on them - yet another pointless initiative to get teh finest profits no doubt. 

Tried to take part in the Cerys Matthews chat this morning but my questions weren't asked. Was excited to be called six times by <lj user=""jay_nyasu_mint""> but I half suspect he didn't intend to call me at all, since he never said anything when I answered, which made for an exciting conversation.

Now for the story of total embarrassment: went to the JobCentre+ to 'sign on' for the first time (quite excited). Waited 40 minutes. Asked how long it would take - confused look, because it's all running to schedule. Inquiries as to why I'm not on the list. Turns out they cancelled my claim because I didn't turn up to sign on the 18th 2 weeks ago! I knew nothing of this supposed signing. 

It turns out it was partly my fault, because it was written on one of my bits of paper, but I had been somewhat misled during the interview I had as to when I should come. But I had phoned them for other reasons and sent them a document they requested on the 18th, so it's not as if they had any argument for assuming I wanted my claim cancelling just because I didn't go to see them that day.

But what really embarrassed me and made me write a complaint letter was the loud voice in which I was told that I'd buggered up and that I'd have to start all over again from the very first hour-long phone interview, along with the fact that they hadn't even bothered to tell me my claim had been cancelled. This is despite the fact they sent me correspondence on the 20th, two days after the claim was apparently cancelled, without any mention that I'd made a mistake. I mean, think if I had a mortgage and kids to support! I'd have lost another two weeks just because they didn't bother to tell me I'd screwed up! Do the social services of England reward all human error with public embarrassment and unnecessary expense and inconvenience?

Anyway, we'll see what happens. Apart from all that, made another carrot cake and did another presentation for my brother in law, this time on starting up a parts and services division within a logistics company. Quite interesting, really."

"event","Some of the reporters who comment on UNIFIL have absolutely no idea how the UN works. They say UNIFIL has been ineffective against the rebels etc. -  but UNIFIL was never mandated to be effective. It's an observer force and it observes until the SC tells it to do something else.  It's a deterrent.

To mandate a force like UNIFIL, the SC requires a decision agreed by all the P5 (US, UK, France, China, Russia) - a decision which must pay respect to what any troop-contributing countries are prepared to agree to. The UN doesn't have an army - any UN hat on the ground is just some State's national army doing double duty. And therefore you will not get troops on the ground if the SC decision says they have to be ready to kick some ass, but there is no prior reason for a State that has usefully trained combatants to be prepared to put its troops at risk over the particular issue at hand. That's simply because no-one in the UN can tell any State what to do, unless it is something it already wants to do for existing political reasons. And that's why the current multi-national force is having difficulties - the US and UK won't go, so who else has an interest in ponying up the soldiers? The US and UK will have to do some baiting.

Anyway, the UN, partially excluding advocacy and diplomacy roles by the lead members of the Secretariat, is almost wholly subjugated to States' national interests and all its activities are nothing more than a mosaic of those co-inciding interests. One most basic points of the UN, in short, is to be a forum that ensures that any politically possible agreements among States can actually occur within a legitimising framework. It's not a poor-man's world government that some people seem to think it is."

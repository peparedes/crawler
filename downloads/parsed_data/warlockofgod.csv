"event","hi guys i miss you all  two weeks ago after bible study i sat and listen to two people talk about thare problum and it stired me something affiel that two people who see each other evary day and dont realize that thay hurt eachother so much this got me to thinking how have i hurt people that i didnt eaven know i hurt  the more i thaught about it the more i realized i do it to alot of people and to god when i ignor him and do what i whant and live the life i whant this is some thing that i haveent ever thought about be for and it is vary profound that we all do it so often and dont eaven realize it  


what is love 
love is never having to say sorry but whantig to when you do something rong 
it is when you look past the falts of the past and see the feutcer
love is forgiving eaven when it hurts 
and love is the one thing that we all have in commen 
god is love and we all have him eaven if we chose not to see him at times

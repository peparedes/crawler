I think that is as far as my achievements go so far, but I will keep you updated as my life progresses."

"event","HAHA.  Once again I seem to have found myself at arms with fighting for the physical world and the world in my head.  I am new to livejournal, so just keep with me.  Any beautiful women who are missing a man I'm here for ya.  Later, peace out."

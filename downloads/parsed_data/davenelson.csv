"event","Lost some of the anger, i wish i could get it back.  I want to get her out of my mind but i dont.  When i try to get her out of my mind, its like a Wile E. Coyote - RoadRunner cartoon. With me as the Coyote.  I just cant succeed. 

I wish we could get together again.

Its like waiting for a movie sequel.  There's room for the sequel, so much more they needed to do that they couldnt finish it all in one movie, they gotta do more.  

Only difference with this situation, i dont know if i can look forward to any trailers about this.


Damn i want her back."

"event","She's off having fun in her hometown, about 300 miles from me.  Too busy to call me but once and never answers my phone calls.  What should i do for fun?  Havent tried to call her for the last few days to see if she would call me.  No calls.  Did get a text message saying i should stop missing her so much.  Apparently she's always out and about, shopping or playing with the baby.  Yeah....right.  


I need some liquor...bad."

Strange, i feel like ive gone back in time.  

I keep thinking about the past...specifcally high school, the plays i used to be/work on.  And then i pass a wreck on the same spot with two almost identical cars to the ones that were in my original wreck in the same spot. 

Felt like Marty McFly passing the same stuff in BTTF 2.  

Had to make sure and ask the first person i came across what year it was.  Im sure they thought i was nuts.  I was pretty woozy when i first woke up and suddenly it didnt seem like such an absurd thing to do.


Damn crazy if you ask me."

Im not holdin my breath anymore.  If i hold anymore, im going to turn three shades past blue.  She's a bitch.  Why is it i have to call her 300 times before she answers, and if i dont answer on the first ring she gives me...ive lost my chance to see her?   Talk about bloody unfair.   To hell with her.  Im going to give her one last chance.  Then...if it happens again...what do you know..im a free man."

"event","i swear...is it possible to love someone and then be really pissed with them all in 2 seconds of time?  I feel like she's a drug that ive been trying to quit.  Dying to see her, and then ..wanting to the fuck away faster than Superman can fly.  I think she's the same way.  On the phone...nothing but ""i want to see you, i love you"" over and over again...and once im there...""you have to leave"" just up out of the blue,...and i didnt even do anything!  I kinda feel like those N and S magnets...wanting to get close but still pushing away even as we get closer...not an exact similie but it will do for now."

"event","I dont know now.  Everyone i talk to says the same thing. That she's cheating/doesnt want to be with me.

From everything i see, that was what i thought too...but i didnt know if maybe i was just too close to the situation to be scientific or whatever about it.

Women dont call their boyfriends someone else's name do they?

Women LIKE taking pictures with their boyfriends dont they?

Why the hell does she not take pics with me, when there are 50 on her damn camera with her and other people...especially her ""friend"" Matt, and only two of me..that she took while i was working one night?

It doesnt make sense any other way.


oooaaahhhhhh....


What do i do now?"

"event","I have a friend who is leaving town pretty soon and I and my girlfriend decided to take her out on the town to celebrate her last night here.  We ended up eating dinner at a place called the crab shack, then out to play some pool in a bar downtown.  I couldnt believe who showed up to play next to us...a ..well best way to describe it would be a woman with HUGE breasts who was hot as hell.  Was kinda funny to see her have on a shirt tied up underneath her boobs with ""im up here"" with an arrow across those big knockers but damn did i spend a lot of the night reading that.  All the more reason i kept missing my shots in pool...lol.  WNYX newstime 2:54am..."

Best Australia Day ever!  I feel like I've been hit by several trucks this morning, all localised around the head and thigh area.  

We decided at 1am Friday night that my brothers, my sister-in-law's siblings and I would enter the sand modeling competition at 8:30 am down at the lake entrance.  Not expecting anything but a bit of fun and a few props, we went down entered and built a sand model of a giant kangaroo.  Totally awesome, we got major props.  There were like, a dozen people around us the entire time after it took shape.  Then after we were done, we found out there was a $300 first prize... we came second place (stupid giant turtle), but that got us $180 prize money!  So we split it $30 each (mines been drank away) and $30 on lunch!

Then in the afternoon, the parents and I went to other celebrations with our greek friends as we do every aus day, which is always nice.  We got flag tattoos, drank from a giant bong shaped bottle.  Nothing says Australia like ridiculous amounts of sun exposure.

Then we went out at night, hence the headache.  I'll get the pictures of the kangaroo soon, you HAVE to see this thing!

Oh yeah, and the hottest 100 was awesome!  It's a annual competition where you vote for your favourite songs of the year.  Congratulations Muse!  Way to beat Silverchair by 13 votes! (there were 700 000 votes in total)"

I told the bear to wish you a Happy Birthday PROPERLY or he gets it.  I guess we're eating teddy bear for Christmas tommorow.

Despite his obvious failings at greetings, I hope your birthday is full of joy and joyness."

"event","I thought I'd upload a few photos to share because I'm extremely lax with LJ and everybody loves photos.  The first one's are from my 19th birthday party, it was a Greek Gods and Goddess's dress up and I went as Mania, Goddess of Insanity.  My bro went as Morpheus, God of Dreams, so it was really just an excuse for us to go as Delirium and Dream from the Sandman comic book series.  The other photos are just a selection from my little '50 photos to represent summer' collection.  I hope you enjoy.

Late at night when I was about to go to sleep, nice and drunk, I realised, I should finally make that drunk LJ post I've always wanted to make!  Problem was, the computer was off and I couldn't be f*cked to turn it on again, so instead I wrote the message in my scrap book.  So with no futher ado, 

<lj-cut text=""my message to you all:"">

""I'm not quite fully drunk but this will do.  There's a talkshow here in Aus called Rove Live & at the end of every interview the ask the guest, ""Who would you turn gay for?""  Me? MEGGLES.  I apologise to everyone else but I <3 u.  It's just that Meggles really does it for me.  Her & Shirley Manson, together.

 *Daydream interlude*

Everybody watch Adam Hill's comedy on Youtube.  I want to stalk this man, he is incredible in his awesomeness.  IT'S MY BIRTHDAY! (well not officially 'cause it's past midnight) Can we start a petition to get Josh Holloway to play Gambit?

I LOVE YOU ALL, I'm sobering up & need to sleep.

(I have a crush on Peter Petrelli and Charlie Cox)

Iri rocks my world!!!
Still haven't got earrings :(""



....yes, it's incredible how dull it is. :D"

I just got back from a 4 day weekend where I went to my cousins wedding.  It was quite awesome, very hippie.  The ceremony was a park in the middle of the forest and the reception was in a marquee in a caravan park, but they had a circus perfomance and I started the dancing (surprise) and more lesbians than...well, ten points to anyone who can finish the sentence.

I went for a job interview last week, same place I did work experience at, it's a market research company.  If I get it I'll be doing a full time job as well as part time uni, which scares the shit out of me, but it's a great opportunity and bla bla bla...

I watched the movie Sunshine over the weekend.  I really enjoyed it because it played out like an old style sci-fi with the slow atmosphere building start and the creepyness and exciting ending.  Also, the guy who plays the main character (I don't know his actor name yet) has officially made his way into 2nd place in my 'best eyes' category, he spent whole scene not saying anything and acting with his eyes.  I pointed this out to my brother and then the next thing that happened was a guy asked him a question and he just stared back at him and the other guy was like ""Alright"", like he had answered.  It was very good timing.

Lastly, my grandpa has just found out he has emphysema, not that he realises how serious that is.  Look, I love him unconditionally of course, but you can't feel too bad because it was only a matter a time before a lifestyle that includes heavy smoking, drinking, gambling my mothers and my grandmothers life into the shithouse, eating constantly and ignoring your diabetes catches up with you.  It sucks, but just another proof that 'Smoking, the S is for stupid'."

So instead of actually showing you the cool, lets just to a 'coming soon to a Lou journal near you':

-Pic spam!  From the Priscilla party I went to!  'Cause I know you're all dying to see me dressed as a man dressed as a woman.
-New icons!  Harry Potter was fun, but I'm thinking I need something more general, something to match my emotions.  Perhaps even (due to my ridiculously short flist) personalised icons for mah friends!
-A new article for TOM!  Yes, this is the one I've been writing for like, a month.  I'm very procrastinating with everything, but I wrote some today instead of doing my econ homework. (Luckily I made a new friend who let me copy of her during the quiz, but now I feel all dirty and soulless)
-A made up meme that allows me to be a fangirl in exactly the ways I want!  Oh, you'll like it, and you'll do it to! (but maybe not)

Now, let's tour casa de lou.  We shall start with the ever poised door, shown here is the warning I feel it is my duty to give to all ye who dare enter:
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a115/discolou/P8180039.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

This theme is continued inside the room with a homage to the greats:
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a115/discolou/P8180040.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

Moving on from here we see the everlasting ""Bunch of corkboards I stuck up and now have random crap on"":
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a115/discolou/P8180041.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

Taking a closer look we can see some of Lou's favourite pieces(ten points to anyone who can name them all!):
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a115/discolou/P8180042.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

We also see a glimpse of Lou's infamous fangirlishness(my tiny little Lost homage in the bottom corner, awww):
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a115/discolou/P8180043.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

One section of the room that is still under construction in the inside of the door.  We can however see that Lou has chosen to base it on the magazine cover style, popular in 96 (20 points to anyone who can name them all):
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a115/discolou/P8180044.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

Next to the door there is a classic double of movie posters, although it is rumoured that Lou was unsatisfied when the movie theatre didn't have an X-men poster with her dearest Wolvie on it:
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a115/discolou/P8180045.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

It is no secret that Lou is a complete nerd.  Note the dragon statues and many fantasy/science fiction novels in her bookcase:

Our hostess is also quite partial to history, her favourite of her pieces being the canopic jars her brother brought her back from Egypt:

There is a great story behind this piece.  After getting her new blinds Lou was interested in investing in curtains as well.  When nobody got them for her, she decided to put a slinky up instead:

In this dark corner of the room we see a small collection of music posters that Lou can see from her bed.  This makes her happy:

The last two selections we bring to you are from a different section of the house, while none the less being inspired by Lou.  Firstly, the famous Angel workstation:

"event","Hey, I passed the next stage of getting my drivers license.  This is the last stage I'll be on before getting a full license, which sounds good, but I'm going to be on it for 2 years at least! *le sigh*

I was feeling so icky in my stomach the whole time.  I hate what my body does when I'm nervous.  ANYway, this new stage lets me legally drive 100km instead of 90km maximum, have more than one passenger between 11pm and 5am and other stuff I don't really know nor care about.  

Our whole getting a license thing is just sooo overcautious though.  The very minimum you have to be on all the stages before getting your full license is 3 and a half years, but almost everyone is on them longer than that.  That's probably how long I've been on mine so far, and I still have two years to go! 

Every stage has a test, and of course, they cost you like a bitch.  Getting my green P's today cost me $105 AU.  Grrr...

In other good news, I found an awesome Op Shop dress to wear to the Priscilla, Queen of the Desert dress up I'm going to tommorrow (think drag queen).  It's blue and glittery and only cost $5, yay!

I promised a pic spam.  I'll try to get one in after lunch and after I take the car to the car repair place.  Ugh, didn't think today would be so busy."

Also, I got a whiteboard, which may not sound so exciting but I've wanted one for like, ever.  I haven't really been able to use it for real purposes yet though, mainly just writing things like ""This is my whiteboard, not your whiteboard!""

I'm excited to buy some of Eri's jewellery.  I've decided I don't need department stores when I have my own jewellery making friend half way across the globe.  We'll see how it goes.

I think Meggles said talk about shoes and boys.  Well, I don't actually have the love for shoes that most women do.  I love lipstick, t-shirts and funky skirts/dresses, but don't own enough.  I'll try and picspam some poses ;)

I'm definetely going to have a real picspam in the next few days.  I feel like I've neglected you guys because I haven't shown much of my life.  Sooooo, in this post, make requests, what do you want to know?  What do you want to see?  Want to know my embarrisingly short love life story?  Hey, I feel like sharing.  

Hmm, she also said talk about boys.  Most of the 'boys' in my life don't have names, they are, 'that cute bartender', 'the guy from economics' etc.  I wish my imagination wasn't so vivid and satisfying, otherwise I would be more bothered to make a real effort.

Have I told you guys this week how much I ADORE YOU ALL!  Where is Iri?  I think I need to tell you all more.  Viva la resurgence of toasters!

Also, I watched almost the whole first season of Supernatural for the first time yesterday and I want to know if anyone else loves it so I have a can have a Supernatural buddy.

Oh, and of course, if the rest doesn't entice you, I had a crossover slash dream last night.  Me.  I know.  Wanna find out who was involved? (If this doesn't get Lissa to read, I don't know what will)

<lj-cut text=""You'll just have to click, but remember SPOILERS"">

Firstly:

SNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  Sorry, had to get that out.

I really enjoyed the book.  Much better than the 'leaked' copy I started reading and then stopped because it disgusted me.  J K did everything I wanted from her.  Sure, it could have been better, the epilogue was slightly too cheery for me, but the rest was great.

I didn't even mind the convuluted 'everyone who has ever been in a HP book turns up' thing, because I wanted to see them all.

The deaths tore me up.  I sobbed for a couple of minutes when Dobby died.  When I read the sentence about Fred I just slammed the book down on my bed and sat in shock for a few minutes.  I then went out to get a glass of water for the shock and Mum and Dad, seeing me emerge assumed I'd finished and I'm all like ""No *quiver*...FRED!!!"".  They were like ""O_o"".  Snape's death just made me emotionally numb, and the memories.

Who is ready to unashamedly jump onto the Snape/Lily bandwagon?  *raises hand*

erm...that's all I can think of now.  oh!  R/Hr was done very nicely, thankyou for not screwing that up JK, preciate it :)

I gotta make some icons now, but first:

Dean Winchester is all kinds of hot.  He is the newest member in my anti-hero club. (not that hard to get into, be hot and don't be Jack Shephard)

My dream!  Okay, it's not that naughty or anything, it was just surprising for me because I'm not a slasher.  I dreamt Alex Karev (Grey's Anatomy) kissed Peter Petrelli.  It. was. awesome!  I had my first uni lectures today but I couldn't concentrate because my brain kept going back to ""Where did my head come up with that?  I've never considered that...*replays*""  Yes, so now, I have to immortalise it in writing because you know how dreams tend to fade away from you.

That's all for now, but I need to discuss, my inner fangirl is going crazy!"

"event","Hey, I finally had a dream about y'all!  Quite disturbing actually:

<lj-cut text=""If this doesn't disprove my sanity, nothing will"">

Okay, you know with dreams there are only certain parts you can remember right?  I can remember two parts, the first,  makes slightly more sense so I'll do that first.

I met Eri!  Now, everyone was there, but I had already met everyone else and we were just hanging.  We happened to be hanging at some sort of market fair and I wandered off and found a stand that was selling jewelery, and I noticed that two of the pieces were the two noose earrings that Eri had made.  So I looked up at the girl behind the counter (who did look like you), but because I'm all 'better to be safe than sorry' I was like, ""What's your name?"", and Eri answered back Eri (even though in real life you be all like Alex, but whatever, dream.)

Then I was squeeling and we were hugging and I was like ""you have to come meet everyone else""

I then saw MasterMinion (you were going by screename in this dream) running away across the road and Eri asked ""Who's that"" and I said it was Meggles even though in truth it looked like neither of you and actually looked like Squid.

The only other thing I remember is everyone meeting up, (you were all there, don't worry), and group hugging.

The other part was a little weirder.  In my dream the toaster wasn't actually a chatroom but some sort of alternate reality where we all met up through over the internet and went on adventures.  We were all on an adventure in a castle and the castle started to fill with water and we had to get out.  All of us got out expect for one person who had the screenname 'Camel' (who actually was a toaster in this dream).  I told my mum about Camel dying and she said ""Well, of course she did, with a a screenname like Camel, only people who use actual names like Ali and Gabs survive"", which is mainly weird because I would never expose my mum to the crazyness of toaster.  Anyway, I don't know if this bodes badly for Squid and Ice.

Then after that I was talking to Camel in the toaster chatroom (even though she did literally die, go figure) and I explained to her that she died because of her sub-par screenname.  I don't think she was very happy.

erm...that's about it.  Dreams are fun...ooo, there were spiders crawling up the side of the castle after we all (but Camel) got out.  They were really big and scary O_o"

Got any idea how I can pass the time?  *squee*  I don't have any memories of waiting for babies to come because everyone in my family who is younger than me came when I was too young to remember.  So it's weird, I've never really been around babies and I'm not too great with kids but I'm just sooo incredibly excited for Aaron and Christine!  They will seriously make the best parents ever."

"event","Milo (Peter Petrelli) cut his hair.  This makes me very sad and angry.  It reminds me of the Scrubs episode where JD hooks up with that girl that is only interested in his hair, ""You know, if it weren't for your hair, I don't think I'd be remotely interested in you.""

Okay, that's a bit harsh, I'm sure after I get over the shock I will love him just as much.  I'm just a little emotional right now and needed to vent :(

On another note, I dyed my hair purple.  It is awesome!  I'm one step closer to getting hair that looks like a mutant's, which is eternally my goal.  I was considering Jean Grey Pheonix hair, but wasn't sure if it would suit my complextion.

Now, let's all look at some Milo pictures to see the damage:

You rank up there with your seduction skills, though you might not know it.
That's because you're a natural at seduction. You don't realize your power!
The root of your natural seduction power: your innocence and optimism.

You're the type of person who happily plays around and creates a unique little world.
Little do you know that your personal paradise is so appealing that it sucks people in.
You find joy in everything - so is it any surprise that people find joy in you?

You bring back the inner child in everyone you meet with your sincere and spontaneous ways.
Your childlike (but not childish) behavior also inspires others to care for you.
As a result, those who you befriend and date tend to be incredibly loyal to you.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>

List your 6 fave shows and then answer the questions. It's much more fun if you make your list first. 

1. Lost 
2. House
3. Scrubs
4. Grey's Anatomy
5. Stargate SG1
6. Simpsons

<lj-cut text=""Click"">

1. Who is your favourite character from #2?
Wilson.

2. Who is your least favourite character from #4?
Derrick (sp?)  McDreamy my ass, just kinda makes me bored.

3. What would a crossover between #1 and #5 include?
Lost and Stargate.  Now lets keep in mind that I haven't watched Stargate in like forever and I'm not up on the newer eps.  I guess the losties would find a stargate on the island and maybe they could travel back to normal through the gate :)  Oh and Daniel Jackson would hook up with one of the lostie girls, probably Claire. 

4. Who is your favourite ship from #6?
The Simpsons?  That's what the ship question is about?  erm...Burns/Smithers?

5. If you were to set one person from #3 and one person from #6 on a blind date, who would they be?
Okay, I really wanted to put something other than a cartoon, but I ran out of shows and need to watch more TV.  I'd send Kelso on a date with Selma

6. If you could meet one person from #4 and spend the day with them, who would it be, and what would you do?
George, and just play video games or something

7. If you could change one thing about #2's plotline, what would you change?
Even thougth I LOVE House, I would center some more storylines around the other characters because I don't feel I know them enough.

8. Explain a relationship between two people (not necessarily romantic) from show #3, and why you like the relationship between them.
Jordan/Dr Cox.  It took me awhile to come around to it but now I love the 9 parts hate 1 part love relationship that they have.

9. If the lead title characters (first name in the credits) from #1 and #5 were both drowning, and you could only save one, who would it be?
erm...not a big fan of title characters in general.  I'd pick Jack from stargate over Jack from Lost though

10. If you could change the title characters' order in the credits for #6, what order would you choose?
I don't care

11. If you were able to add a new character, any kind of character you wanted, to the storyline for #4, what would the character be like and what would their role be?
A hot, damaged, sarcastic smartass and their role would be to make me swoone :)

12. What happens in your favourite episode of show #2?
Three stories.  I can't be bothered to retell the storyline, but it's really well done

13. If you could kill off one of the characters of #1, who would it be and how would you do it?
Oh, let me think...Charlie.  I would hang him for good, fitting punishment

14. If you got the chance to visit the set for either show #3 or show #5, which would you choose?
3, Just cause I'm more into it now

15. Who out of each of the shows would you like to date?
Lost: Sawyer 
House: Wilson
Scrubs: Dr Cox
Grey's Anatomy: erm...Alex or George
Stargate: Daniel
Simpsons: lol, umm,Lenny, heh"

"event","Step One

- Make a post (public, friendslocked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fandom-related (""I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

- If you wish for real life things (not fics or icons), make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

- Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ so that the holiday joy will spread.

Step Two

- Surf around your friendslist (or friendsfriends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list. And now here's the important part:

- If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use--or even know where you could get someone's dream purebred Basset Hound for free--do it.

You needn't spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out, it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf--to spread the joy. Gifts can be made anonymously or not--it's your call.

There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Just...wish, and it might come true. Give, and you might receive. And you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special.

<lj-cut text=""My wishlist"">
1. Animated Romy Icons:  I really want some.  Like, so I could have a section of the comic for an icon, mmmm.

2. Scrubs wallpapers:  because it is my new love.

3. Cult ships vids:  Anything Conmama, EClaire, Chana and hell any...any other weird pairing.  Shock me, I'm just soooooooo sick of canon vids.

4. Unlimited downloads: though I won't get it from anyone reading this, it would still be nice.

5. James Wilson art:  As in, the character off House MD.  There really isn't enough Wilson art around.

6. A creavtive UN: Or just a UN in general, because they make me happier than I can describe.

7. Scrubs season 4: Once again, won't be coming my way, but I had to write it

8. Something that will restore my excitement over conmama, the vid would probably work well, but that multi-chapter thing meggles was asking for sounds quite nice too

9. erm...some new clothes? Because I'm sick of assaulting people when I don't have anything to wear out.

10. World peac...just kidding.  How about a nice big christmas party?"

I've had three tests so far, had ancient history today, it went well (I hope).

I finish not this friday, the friday after, and will hopefully just be moping round the house (oh god please) after that time when im not working.

I'm not really stressed, but I get stressed a bit each night before an exam.  I've got business studies tomorrow so lets just wait for the worry to come after I realise just how much I should of learnt.

I bought the box set of Lost season 2 and Xmen 3 to reward myself after I finished my first exam.  I am now spending a lot of my time trying to resist watching them (sidenote: wolverine is hot)

I also got tickets to the big day out recently which is extremely exciting but because it happened awhile ago I can't convey the excitement here, this is a link to the lineup:
http://www.bigdayout.com/lineup/artists.php

erm...I really, really miss hanging out with everyone, even though it's only been like a few weeks and I still come on sometimes.  I've been getting ideas for vids and not being able to do them, which is such a bitch.

Anyway, I should really get back to business studies, thanks for the rant."

"event","I got a job!

It was weird, I'm still kinda...shocked.

There's me, with my little resume's in mah little bag, 18, never had a job before, walking around Stockland Shellharbour trying not to show that I was shit scared. 

So most of the places I went to were like ""you have to apply online"" or ""we're don't really need you but we'll take your resume and put it in a pile where it's greatest hope will be to be recycled and not thrown out""...anyhow.

I go into this shop called Dusk, they sell candles, and I'm all like ""My name's Louiza, I'd like to apply for a job"" and the girl all smily and shows me to this woman who is walking out of a door out the back and she's all like ""you're early!  You caught me eating my lunch"" and I'm all like  ""WTF mate?"".  So she sits me down to interview me and she's like ""I'll just get your resume"" and I'm all like ""Umm...I've got my resume right here.""
""Your not Jessica""
""No...I'm a new person.""
""Oh...well I'll interview you now anyway.""

So we talk for awhile and at some point in the conversation I realise she's giving me the job.  So now I am a 'Christmas Angel' at Dusk.  Yes, it's just a christmas job but I am planning to impress the hell out of them with my skills and get the job after the break.

So she tells me all about the uniform and everything and now I'm still in shock...

Oh, and as I was walking out she introduced me to the girls who were working there and they seemed really nice and there I go and get my top caught on one of the decorations as i'm talking to them, lol.  The girl helped me out of it and then she says ""Hehe, I just wanted to give you a hug"" jokingly.  Did I mention how nice they seemed?

Haha, one other thing that helped me get the job, fate apparentely.  The woman said to me numerous times ""This must be fate, you came at the perfect time.""  I was like, ""erm...yeah!""

So there we go, my RL is actually getting a kick in the bum of change for once, which is nice."

"event","Okay, I'll be trying to make most of my internet time on here for the next few weeks as I really shouldn't have time for it.  It's that time, my HSC starts in two and a half weeks and that means study.  This means if you see me in toaster or on LF I want you to give me virtual slap and send me back to the working desk.

Today, as well as doing lovely things such as integration and crime fiction writing, I am preparing a resume.  A little confession I have is that I am turning 18 in like, 3 days and I have never made a resume or gone for a job, call me lazy...whatever.  Anyway, after the tests are over I'm going to have nothing but time so it is about time I tried to make some money, that is if people will employ an 18 year old over a lower paid 15 year old which is quite unlikely.  Making a resume is extremely boring and that's probably why I haven't made one.

So although I will need to make entries on here for the sake of getting my daily fill of the internet, do not expect them to be particularly interesting.  If you do however, wish to leave me encouraging messages that I can respond to with hugs and kisses, feel free."

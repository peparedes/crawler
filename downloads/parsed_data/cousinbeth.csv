Current mood: grumpy

So recently when I was at the ""doctor"" she and I were talking about how the heck I will ever find someone who thinks I am as great as I am and will want to marry me and be my bff.
Well, she told me that although both men and women list ""sense of humor"" as one of the most important attributes in a potential mate, men want women who appreciate their sense of humor, not funny women. Dammit, I'm so funny that my friend who worked for Conan O'Brien told Conan O'Brien that I was the funniest person she ever met. I am so screwed.
I am doomed to be the girl who every guy likes to hang out with for fun, or in between girlfriends, but that they never want to get serious with.
That's it! From now on, no more Miss funny girl. I am going to be serious and sour 24/7. I will consider it a socialogical study, and see what happens.
It's going to be hard, I mean, I don't try to be funny, I just find myself saying stuff that makes milk shoot out noses, and bladders fail. I am not sure how I can change that. Shizzle, I am doomed, doomed I tell you!"

It's so funny, cause I remember when I was in college I thought ""Man I can't wait til all I have to do is work"". and now I think ""Man, I wish I was back in college."" things were so easy then. Go to lots of parties, meet lots of boys, do some homework, hang out with the dorm mates, make excuses as to why homework is not done, party party party on weekends how fun!
Work life is overwhelming right now. I am so lucky to have the co-workers and friends that I have. they make it easier to manage.
So, thanks to Jenny from the block, Jonny. Erick with a K, tara, Holly, Elissa, Karen and Auntie Karen, Matty, Gregg, Danielle, Kellie, Darlene, Kipper, taylor and whomever else i forgot. you have made it so much better to get back into the grind after my horrible two week, but in reality, three month ""vacation"".

"event","Stepford is alive and well

So, I moved to California four years ago..holy cow! I have lived in the OC since I moved out here. I love it...beautiful, scenic, not as many silicone parts as L.A, but still home to the beautiful people and I have such envy of the houses out here. I mean, a one bedroom condo in a crappy pre-fab area goes for 400K.
Anyway, I moved a month ago (back into an apartment with my friend Elissa pictures here with the purple wig...we are friends not lesbians, we both like guys, so any takers, here we are!) and it was a nightmare. I was supposed to move from Rancho Santa Margarita (aka the gateway to hell) to Mission Viejo.

Well, my friends showed up on the morning of the move with the truck, and we loaded all my wordly belongnigs in by 10:00am. Yay! So, we get a call from the new apartment complex here's a synopsisi:
Elissa: ""Hello""
Apartement jerk: ""Umm hi, I know you're supposed to move in right now and that your lease started at midnight, but we haven't changed the carpets yet.""
elissa: Ok, well we've got the truck loaded and are on our way there.
Apartment jerk: "" ok, I guess. It will only take an hour or so to change the carpets.
Elissa: ""Whatever!"" Slams the phone as much as you can on a cell.

So, we drive to the new place and when we get there the apartment leasing jackass says ""Ummmm, I don't really want to let you see the place"" So of course, we're like, ""Oh it's on we are going there right now.""
BTW, I had my dog with me because I though we were moving in.
So, we go to the apartment. We walk in and were overwhelmed with the kind of smell that would accompany most CSI episodes if they had smell-evision. Urine, feces, general nastiness. We walked in and I though ""Oh my God, how will I live here it's disgusting???!!!!"" My friend Erick pointed to a corner and said"" Hey that's poop!!!"" and then we all realized we were walking in cat litter.
We ran out in horror..not to mention that the carpets were stained black, as if the former occupant has thrown every bit of leftover drink, and food on the floor when he was done, and that he held his cats up in the air and rotated them around the carpet like a sprinkler when they had to pee or poop.
Man this is a lot to type.
So, we walked back out to the truck and a guy walks up to us and says ""Hey, I've still got all my stuff in your garage, they are giving me a new garage today, so I'll be out in a few hours.""
Okay, WTHell???? So, we are all talking about how horrible this is and how we can't possibly live there. My friends Jen and Matt offered me $100.00 per month not to move in. And Matt looks down at his legs and screams :""What's on us????!!!!""
Yupp, we were all infested with fleas. Including Trixie (my dog) she had them all over her, even running across her face!
So, I marched over to the office and said""You know how you have that 30-day satisfaction gauruntee? We're not satisified and we are not moving here!"" The jackass leasing agent (We'll call her Heather cause that's her name), says ""oh, even if we change the carpets?"" I'm like screaming ""HEATHER, WE ALL HAVE FLEAS AND SOMEONE IS IN OUR GARAGE. WE JUST WALKED THROUGH POO. HELL NO WE ARE NOT LIVING HERE. WE WANT OUR MONEY BACK NOW.""
To which she replied: um we'll get you a check by Wednesday. Sorry...
to which I replied ""HOW CAN YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF AND LOOK ME AS A PERSON IN THE EYE AND TRY TO THINK IT'S OK FOR YOU TO RENT THAT PLACE TO A HUMAN PERESON. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMDE AND FEEL HORRIBLE ABOUT YOURSELF. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? I AM HOMELESS, THANKS A LOT!!!""
She kind of got teary which made me happy in a mean way.
So, i walked back over to the truck and saw the guy in the garage and it clicked that maybe he was the caveman who had been living in the apartment. So I asked him: ""Did you live in number 88?"" And he said (with no shame or hesitation) ""Yup"" and I said ""You are a human, how can you live like that? I feel really sorry for your quality of life because residentially that is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen and WE ALL HAVE FLEAS BECAUSE OF YOU!!!!
He then screamed at me ""LOOK IN THE MIRROR"" Say what,
So I went back to the truck and almost started crying but instead we started calling every apartment complex we could think of and asked if we could move in that day. finally we found one. Of course it's like $200.00 more than we expected to pay, but it's beautiful.
It's in a magical place called Ladera Ranch. Until I moved here, I always referred to this place as a cult. It is perfect. Perfect lawns, perfect people, perfect houses, perfect 2.2 kids and dogs per family, parks on every corner.
Anyway, I am now a happy resident of Stepford, CA. Whatever they pipe into the air here has affected my senses and I walk around with a big crazy grin and say ""Hello, how are you?"" to everyone I pass while walking Trixie. It's awesome.
STW We're suing the other apartment complex.
And the absolute kicker is that hte guy who was in the garage refused to move into the other apartment that they offered him because it has ""a bad smell"". For real..."

"event","Something terrible happened last night. My friends and I went out to celebrate my roommates birthday. We went to dinner and then to a very ""hole in the wall"" cowboy bar. It was pretty boring, so we decided to go to a different bar. I should insert here that I was the driver and had nothing to drink. Actually, we were all really low-key for some reason. On our way to the next bar, we passed an accident that was really bad. We got re-routed through a parking lot and got kind of lost for a few minutes. We were thinking that i was kind of funny that we were lost in a parking lot. Then we went on our way. We got to the intersection the the bar is at, and were stopped at a red light. 

Suddenly, a huge crash happened in front of us! A car had gone through the red light and got hit by an oncoming car head-on. The on-coming car filled with smoke, and we could see in the other car that the passenger looked slumped over and in bad shape. I looked around and ran to the car that was filled with smoke. There was a tow truck next to us that we could see was calling in the accident, so we decided to get out and do something. We went over to the CRV first (not the car that caused the accident). There were 4 people inside. They all were able to walk, but one girl's shoe was stuck under the seat, so she was stuck and she and her boyfriend were panicking. We weren't sure if the car was on fire or what. Thankfully it was just the airbags that were smokey. I helped one girl who was hurt over to the sidewalk, and then went over to the other car. 

The lady in the passenger seat of the other car was not conscious and was barely breathing. I tried to talk to her, but no response. I didn't know what to do, but thought if I tilted her seat back it might help her breath or something. I didn't want to tilt her head in case she had spinal or neck injuries.  Her husband was having trouble breathing. The two girls from the other car were having trouble breathing, the two guys from the other car were cut up, but ok. I went to help the girls on the sidewalk and my roomie stayed with the elderly lady in the car. After a minute (so fast!!!) the fire dept showed up.
The ambulance took the elderly man from the one car to the hospital. Then they put a blanket over the elderly woman...she died. It was horrible. I had just held her hand and touched her head and tried to do something. It made me so sad. On the one hand, I do hope that my death could be that quick and painless, but on the other hand, that couple had no idea that the wife would die that night. The elderly man had turned left at the light thinking that it was green, but really, the straight lights were green, and the turn arrow was red. The man kept saying ""I thought it was green...I thought it was green"".

The guys in the other car were so shaken up. The driver had just moved out here with his wife. He was very upset.

It was so sad. I feel really glum today. I know there is nothing we could have done differently to make the situation different...it's not that. I am just not sure why we showed up at that light at that moment. I think it was God that led us there, sober, even though we were out for a party. I can't get the images out of my head. I wish there was a way to get back in touch with any of the people involved."

1. Three weeks ago I found out I got a $10,000.00 per year paycut.
2. Two weeks ago I decided I needed to give notice at my job due to #1.
3. One week ago I worked up the guts to do #2 (haha!! do #2!!!)
3. Present tense: I am frantically looking for jobs so that I am not unemployed and homeless on June 1st (my lease runs out May 31, so that's the end date I gave work.)
So if you know anyone who's looking for a residential program manager with great flexibility and creativity who happens to love planning and running activities and events, point them in my direction!"

"event","So, maybe you remember how I mailed many of you the Jason Mraz Curbside Prophet cd last year at this time. Last night I saw him live in San Diego. It was the last night of his Curside Prophet tour. We got the tickets last week, kind of last minute. I was very annoyed to be paying $45 to see him live, but also didn't want to miss the chance. I kind of hate seeing artists who get pretty popular after they get big. I don't go for overblown self-important stage shows (except NSYNC...)
The show was awesome! First of all, it was in the Symphony Hall, so it was small and had great acoustics. Jason Mraz got his start in the coffe houses in San Diego, so there were loads of people he knew in the audience. It was really a personal and great perormance. He narrates and free-form sings the whole time. There's not a quite or boring moment. Even when he plays the popular songs from his album, he makes them unique and adds in new lyrics and musical interludes, that make it really cool.
If you ever have the chance to see him live in a similar venue, do it!"

1. I saw the MaryKate and Ahsley movie New York Minute with the kids I work with. I loved every New York Minute of it. IT was cheesy, predictable and foolish! It was great! I can't wait till the Hillary Duff Cinderella movie comes out...hope the kids want to see it so I have an excuse!

2. I lost 5 pounds...bringing my total to 25. I still have about 40 to go, but at least I'm back in it a little. I took a many months break between the first 20 and this five, but I'll get there.

3. I hosted poker night last Monday for the first time since the Superbowl. It was fun. We didn't play too much, but it was still fun to have friends over and hang-out for a change. 

4. Trixie is 15 pounds now. She's 5 months old and really good! She is very funny and smart.It's almost time for her to have ""the operation"". I'm nervous about finding the right vet. I'm not wild about the one I've been going to.

I guess that's it for now."

It wasn't moving or rattling, so that's a positive. A guy there got a stick and chased it out through the fence. Of course, there are snake holes popping up all over the grass in the park, so I expect to see more.  I didn't know they are poisonous...dumb I know but whatever. Now I'm scared. I don't want my flesh melting and falling off due to a snake bite while picking up a tennis ball for Trixie!

On a lighter note, I'm pretty sure that one of the guys from <b>Blink 182</b> goes to the dog park. His name is Mark and he has a chocolate lab puppy named Sasha. She's cute and so is he. I really do think it's him. He looks and sounds just like him...I'll have to ask next time I see him."

"event","I have a huge crush on one of the guys who has been working at our site for the past three weeks. I have had the crush on him since the first second I started talking to him a few weeks ago. His name is Hector, and he's a foreman for a carpet business (he might own the company, I'm not sure). He is really a hottie. He's also funny and smart and bi-lingual and cool and fun to spend time with. One afternoon I broke my va uum and he fixed it for me. Seriously, given my love of vacuuming, that is the way to my heart. I was hanging out with him whenever possible when I was down at the building a couple weeks ago, and then I had to stop going to do other stuff. By the time I got back down there this past week, his work there was done and just the guys who work for him were still working at the site. I was sure I would never see him again and not get to slide him my number.
Saturday me and my friends parked there in order to hit the town for a big parade, and guess who was there making sure the job was all done and done correctly? Hector!!
Yay!! He has my number now and should call soon. The only problem is that when I put my number in his phone and he dialed it, it went right to my voicmail, and I never got a missed call or message. I hope he can get it together so that it will connect. 

In other news, Trixie is now driving me to drink. She spent most of yesterday barking and biting. I hope this phase passes quickly. The only thing that stops her is my throwing a Mountain Dew can with pennies in it on the floor when she starts barking. She hates that can. She was running through the room like it was going to jump up and bite her! I hate to say it, but it was secretly funny to see her streaking across the floor in a hurry to get away from that can."

While going to the mailbox I passed a couple of cute guys who were skate boarding and riding a scooter around the parking lot. We said hello which almost nobody bothers to do in this stupid apartment complex. Anyway, I was sure that it was a guy from the current Road Rules/Real World Challenge whose name I wasn't sure of. Remember, I always spot quasi-celebs wherever I go. I was also sure that it wasn't him, but just looked a little like him. I didn't see the two guys again.
Until this morning. I was driving to the complex and the two guys were crossing the street.I was on the phone with Jen and said ""Hey, there goes ""Road Rules"" crossing the street."" Then I laughed cause I had nick named a stranger ""Road Rules"".
An hour later I was at the pool with Doug, and who happened to be sitting there but ""Road Rules"" himself. He and his friend popped open a Corona and I got caught staring. I apologized for staring and drooling and told them I was coveting the beer. They offered me one which I refused cause I was working. We ended up in  semi-long discussion about the work I do, the place we are building and one thing led to another. Turns out his name is Jeremy, he just got voted off of the Inferno on MTV (he said ""I have appeared on a show on MTV called Road Rules, it runs Monday nights at 10 if you want to catch it"" It was funny, not stuck-up, but rather like he was advertising for MTV) and he is a national speaker about abstinence and works for a church. He is a very commited Christian and seemingly nice guy.(Yes we had a very interesting chat about how people assualt Christians who drink alcohol...) He wants to come volunteer at Casa de Amma. The ball is in his court...he has my card and info. I hope he gets in touch. He is one of those people who reek of inner-peace and quiet confidence. Would be great to have him around our new place."

While at the local cowboy bar, I started up a conversation with some guys who were decidedly not the cowboy types. You know, mesh trucker hats, thick eye glasses and sneakers with black socks (a style that I was also rocking...just the black socks and sneakers though. I look awful in glasses and can't wear baseball hats to save my life. Anyhooo...)characters really. They turned out to be really cool and fun! We gave them a lift home and stopped at the Harbor House for some chow on the way. I made the mistake of ordering a short stack of pancakes with my Bud Light...I'll never do that again. What a bad combination. 
So, when we got to their house, Ryan and Johnny (those are their names) said ""Hey girls, we would love to play you a song inside, come in for a minute."" We were like ""Yeah whatever..."" but went in anyway just for the laughs. They had a full drum set and an array of guitars to play. They played us three songs that were flawless. It was sweet.
We had to head home since it is now officially moving  day, but Ryan asked for my number before we left (go girl! haha!) I gave him my card with my cell # written on the back. He noticed that my last name is Farrell and was like ""Uh, Farrell? like Perry? like Jane's Addiction????"" And I said. ""Yup, one in the same"" He then played me my own private version of ""Jane Says"" which happens to be one of my all time favorite songs. It was really cool. Ryan may be one of the funniest guys I have ever met, except for the guy I went out with last weekend from Texas. But other than him, oh and Chip, Ryan is definitely the funniest guy I've ever met. I don't expect to ever hear from him again...but hope is what keeps us girls going."

9:45- Went to church

11:30- Did volunteer child care at church

1:15- Stopped at party store and (as if completely forgetting the teachings and beautiful experiences of earlier church time) fought off Orange County house wives for the last three football shaped helium balloons at the party store, bought some other stuff that made me laugh (ok, pom poms and a fake Oscar trophy to be explained later)

1:45- Got home and helped roommate arrange high-fat manly snacks on football shaped plastic trays while drinking a Negra Modela with lime

1:50- Gayed-up the ambiance of the Super bowl party by putting out balloons, football shaped dishes, and writing ""Tom Brady is hot"" on the window in window chalk while laughing profusely at my own humor

2:00- 7:00- Welcomed friends and proceeded to consume beer and approximately 5,000 calories and 632 grams of fat (mostly saturated) while watching my Patriots (finally) win the game in the last minute, and watching Jt get cozy with one now-famous boob

7:00-7:02- Held private award ceremony in which Mattributes won a bogus Oscar in the category of ""Best male performance in a Saddleback Church Comedy Improv show""

7:02-whenever- Took my poker playing friends in almost every hand we played. It was only my second time ever playing...I won $7.00

9:00-9:03- Ate a heaping mouthful of <b>""Mrs. Fresheleys Creme Filled Red Velvet Fingers""</b>...later challenged Ellie29 to do the same for the huge sum of one American dollar...she did it. Waiting for the photo proof from Moneysocal.

"event","I watched you fall asleep again. I dont know why i dreamt what i did, again. You woke me up again. I brushed my teeth again. I reached out for your hand, and you for mine again. I looked at you through that almost window...again. I almost escaped you, again. You found me again. I cant change if you wont, but you wont change if i wont, so were stuck here...again. You saved me again. I wonder why you tell me all the things i already know again. i thank you again for keeping the things that make me sad a secret. Were falling so far from each other with time, but were ever so close, what can i say to you that you dont already know? I sometimes wish you werent there more than anything, maybe thats to say i wish i werent there. I feel alone even though your around. You require so much of me, but i struggle to fulfill even the basic requests. Am i everything you wanted. Am i what you imagined id be as a child...far from it. I dont know how long i can hide you from the world. I want to share you, i just dont want you to get hurt...I have so much to say to you, but you of all know that words cant describe my feelings of you..."

With the way this world works.

Happy I am not,
With the way people slave all there lives only to try and have fun at the age of 50 when they are to tired to do the things they desire.

Happy I am not,
With the way we accept the captive lives we were born into.

Happy I am not, 
With the Media's freedom to brainwash, and my lack of resistance to them.

Happy I am not, 
With my current ant like position in this, the only world in wich I live, run by a select few, but most definatly not selected by me. 

Happy I am not,
With a mind thats free to explore, to learn, to communicate, but is limited by untruth.

Happy I am not, 
With my life as It is now.

Happy I am not, 
With the game I was born into, where awards and fame seperate the masses. Where freedom depends on how much you own. 

I love america because I was programmed to say that. Im a bad person if I think otherwise. I dont stand a chance against you.. You are them and I am them, but I think of them as a machine that cant be stopped or contolled by me. 

I dont know the truth and I will probably die never knowing it, so I will create my own truth...

I found an engine for Arata for 450 dollars, only problem is i dont have any money... i dont know what im saying in this journal, kinda seems like im just beating around the bush.....I miss my friend ashly, one day we were talking, then the next day we were like sorta talking.then we were just not talking at all. I suppose its my fault for some reason, i must have done something. Now if we ever do start talking again its gonna be all weird,like forced or something. We never really hang out, so it makes conversation sorta hard to do. Maybe this marks the part where we(bonnie and clyde) get shot up in the car and its the end of everything. I just miss my friend and it makes me sad. I have had so many friends that were best friends, and over the years they just sorta faded away and somehow once a year they would pop up. I dont really.........I Miss you all.."

So if if on my face there's a smile, underneath it all is lonlyness.I guess thats why i like videogames. They turn me into someone else. When im playing a game i have nothing to worry about. I can do what i was put there to do. I can be the hero.

I always say the Wrong things and do exactly what i dont want to. When i finally have the right thing to say, i dont say it. To make it worse Arata(my car)is now not just sick but i believe hes on his last legs. When im driving, or trying to drive i feel happy, but not with other people in the car. I guess i could survive on a deserted island, wouldnt feel to much different. I have friends, but Im under all of them. I can take all you can dish, but i cant let go of it. It will stay with me forever. this isnt directed to anyone. Just thoughts. I dont like to have enemies. but eventualy i will say something to make you angry, or maybe i will annoy you.
or what do i do when i cant make you laugh. I cant walk without stepping on toes. 

Look at me different, becuase im not who you think. im alone, i was in the womb alone, and sadly i will die alone.

I love when music hits me right where it counts. You know when you hear a good song and it makes you all emo. When it gives you a feeling inside that only you know, or at least you think only you know. Well music to me is a gateway to things, like a drug it gets my imagination flowing. I want so much to get the message but sometimes it doesnt come, and when that message doesnt come its because the song is poo to me at that point in time. I didnt like Mr. Marley about 3 years ago that much, but now i dont hear a bobby song that i dont like. I guess Music is like food, different flavors for different time.

I cannot lie to anybody that is taking the time to read my ""mind"" i think about japan almost 22 hours a day but WHY, WHY THE HELL DO I WANT TO GO TO JAPAN SO MUCH..i have no clue. Sometimes i think when i get there i wont like it(try to make myself think), but thats not the case because, i know that im supposed to go there for some reason. the land of the rising sun. (i just saw an mr2 in the background on the news). Sometimes i think ""maybe if i take japanese classes i can get a job and move to japan"". i wouldnt even think twice about moving to japan and never coming back to america...i mean, what reason do i have to stay here. ive seen alot of it, not enough of it. but then i think i have never seen japan, i dont even know how people would/will accept me when/if i go. Every time i read about it it makes me wish that much more that i was there and that i never had to be here,sometimes i wish i lived there without knowing japanese then i wouldnt have to listen to what people had to say...but alas eventually i would learn. i feel all the time like there is this long rope attached to me and it goes all the way to somewhere in japan and im supposed to grab hold and follow it back home. but where is this place? i dont know if ill ever make it to japan but when and if i do.....i know i will be happy. but to the question of why do i want to go to japan, i just dont have any one short answer. maybe i will just start telling people, ""because thats where im supposed to be""......"

"event","Oh My Goddess, last night was the greatest night of my life....almost. It wasn't all bad though. OK lets start at the beginning, it was a light and super clear day i had just arrived at Zachary Zablosky's House, i knew something wasn't right because his room smelled like his dogs breath...ok forget all of the details.

Well now its 6:45 and We had already went to the warehouse to pick up our tickets to see the Living Legends on there ""Almost famous tour"" Dafari was touring with them. The main event of the night was supposed to be the Alkoholiks on there ""straight No Chasers Tour"" but more people came to see the Living Legends. Now to get back on track, its 6:45 and ahahah we don't have ride. This concert is at the Cajun house on 3rd ave and Scottsdale road. So Zach calls his dad and tells him to come pick  him up. Well we get there at 7:19 and we get in line to get in. The concert is supposed to start at 8:00, at about 9:30 we finally get in. 

The Concert...
Well the concert was dope.It ended about 1:25ish. so we get off the bar counter and realize what we knew would soon come...We had no ride home.....LoL now all i could do was laugh, we weren't angry because i had a dollar so we got some change and called my house...well my parents had just got home and had went to sleep so they weren't coming to get us. so with our last 50cents we called zachs sister. Now his sister is a complicated person so..well she basically said no there is no way i'm coming to pick you up because you got me in trouble..goodnight.So both of us, weary from the concert, penniless and assed out by our families made the choice we knew we had to..

The Journey....
Ok now i don't know about you but i don't usually walk home from Scottsdale rd and 3rd Ave. to Warner and price but, what choice did i have...So were walking and talking, i know the talking is what got us through the walking...and The whole time we keep on talking about how bad this sucks and how hard it is to walk this far and how were gonna get shot up before we get close, or our energy is gonna drain out and were gonna have to start a fire and sleep in a park(i had some matches some guy gave me).We were so angry..so zach had to say it, he just had to say it...""at least its not raining"". Well 1 1/2 hours or so later we reached Mckellips we had decided an hour ago that when we got to this one bus stop by our friend jimmy's house we would sit down. When we sat down it felt like we were floating around and all these pains we didn't know existed showed up. so we got back up and kept on treckin this is where zachs comment comes in. i feel a drip hit me in the eye and i just start to laugh, then all of a sudden a furious wind starts to blow and it starts pouring. Then we start talking about if we just had some money to get some hot chocolate how much better things would be, Bam!! 5 minutes later zach finds 2 dollars on the sidewalk Yay!!. Now we have something to live for so we don't jump of off the Rio Salado PkWay Bridge. We keep on walking and were all happy because we know as soon as we get to University there is a texaco and we can get all of the Hot chocolate we need. Yay, i get all excited and start skippin and i realize i cant even feel when i skip. Yay!! were at the light waiting to cross the street we can see Texaco(remember its raining).So we run(slide our feet across the ground really fast)across the street and go up to the door, the excitment building up inside...Clank, the door is locked and the guy tells us if we want to get something we have to tell him what we want and he will give it to us through the little window, pff peace out man. Good ol zach ""To circle K with us"". Yay!! we get to circle k where its not 40 degrees inside but warm and purchase not hot chocolate, but a butterfinger froth cappachino. ah with every sip i could feel my body becoming that much warmer.At the time my mouth was happy to take in all the warm goodness, but now i realize that i burnt the poop out of my tongue. Then we saw a homeless guy sleeping outside under this thing with a small blanket next to his wheel chair and we realized that the 20 miles that we had to walk wasn't that bad after all, because we actually had some place to walk to. so finally at 4:50 we arrive at zachs house and i get my skateboard and hurry to the bus stop so i can catch the bus to the middle of the research park and skate home. i got home at about 5:30 because i had to walk through my neighborhood so as not to wake up the neighbors. Got home washed my face brushed my teeth put on nice warm jammies, put on a dvd and went to sleep.

PS..
I didn't go to school today but i called my teacher and told her and she agreed that i shouldn't have come in..made my morning all the more better, plus the bus driver on the bus was a cool guy."

But before i got in the shower i got naked...About 15 minutes later my buddie justin called and told me he was outside. So i went outside but forgot my sweater and we made our way to the Car Show. so were there and im cold as a mofo but its cool because im so happ happ that there are all these cars, you know how it is when you dont care about somthing because there is somthing else so good your fine. well we ""chilled"" there for a while and everything was ""cool"". Well finally at like 11:00 we get the word on where the races are. We go to the gas station on mill and southern and everyone is getting gas, 40 minutes later everybody is ready. so we hop on the freeway and everybody is weaving in and out of traffic all these euro cars doing like 90-100. me and justin got the car up to 119...Let me tell you a bit about justin, the only thing his car has going for him is his Audy system. but other than that its a regular Automatic(lol)Civic. He thinks his car is super dope, me and my mom got to 120 easily on the way to california in our Malibu.But back to the story at hand. So were riding on the freway for about an hour and a half. then we finally get off and go to the first spot to race. when we get there i find out that its right behind the freeway on by arizona mills. now this makes me angry because im cold and i have been riding in a car for an hour and a half just to get to some place thats only 15 minutes away from where we were an hour and a half ago. I was soon happy again because when we got there there was about 15 cars and lots of people. so were racing for a while and then, The Piggies come in a truck. Everybody runs to there cars and drives away. now i ran but since i dont have a car i was kind left standing in the road alone. Oh yeah, by this time my nose is running and im shaking like a crack head. So im standing there all alone and cold holding my backpack(filled with my video camera and related materials) then some Mexican guys from the bugout crew pulled up in a blazer and told me to hop in. so im driving around for 20 minutes with these people ive never met looking for justin. well i finally find him and everyone else at a texico in tempe somewhere. and then we all drive out to the budweiser plant to finish out the races. Some guy there had a 280 zx with so much torque that when he revved it up the back of the car almost touched the ground, but he lost to a guy named robert in a delsol. well we went to big justins house at around 3:50 watched a movie and then justin took me home at 5:20. all in all it was a good night, if you dont count the fact that my throat hurt bad i was sneazing so much it made me angry my nose was running like a toilet in a bathroom at a bar, and i had church in the morning. but hey all in all it was a high quality nicht."

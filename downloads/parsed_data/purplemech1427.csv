"event","This is my last entry. Well alot has gone on. I have been working alot lately. I have been taking care of things that need to be taken care of. My car is dying on me. I am now on anti-depressents. Jamie broke up with me. She says its cause of the whole sneaking around thing and I know it has partly to do with taht but I know that it was mainly for the fact that she likes sean kelley. I dont hate her for dumping me for him. What ever it wont bother me. I am 20 years old and I expected way to much out of her to tell you the truth. I wanted to be with her for a long time but I knew it wouldnt happen cause I knew there would be someone out there that could take her from me. In all truth I dont care anymore. I am not being an asshole when I say that. What I mean by that is that she is young and she is someone that wants to experience alot. I understand that completly. I am young to but I am to mature in my mind for anythign like that. I have been hurt way to much to deal with that anymore. So in turn I dont have to wonder if I am gonna lose her to any other guy now. I dont have to worry about her cheating on me anymore. I dont have to think much anymore. I still have feelings for her yeah that will always be but she is now a lost love. I hope that she isnt hurt by sean kelley cause to tell you the truth if he hurts her even though me and jamie arent dating I will kill him. I will beat him severly. Dont hurt her sean she deserves to be loved to be with someone that will take care of her and charish her. Dont hurt her I dotn care if your in vermont or in boston you cheat on her if you two start dating if your not already if you take advantage of her you wont have to worry about her uncle sean look out for me. I will kill you believe me. So anyway my life is shit but I am happy right now. Jamie if you read this please know your happiness still will always come first. As long as your happy then you will be fine. I am here if you need someone to talk to you know that. And I dont hate you believe me. I said I would care for you forever and I will always care for you. Some day down the road we will meet up again and we will catch up and rememeber the good days. It was great while it lasted. I appreciate you giving me a chance. Someday you will see that commitment isnt that hard or that scary. Someday you will see and I hope you dont have to figure it out the hard way. I am not tryin to be an asshole when i say this jamie but beware of sean. He goes to college remember that and he does party. Thats all i am gonna say. well peeps thats it I will see ya'll on the flip side of life."

"event","Yea so I am updating again because I have some thoughts that I need to get out. I have been watching people and hearing complaints about things they have no control over. I have done some complaining myself. Hell I am guilty for alot of shit. People complain about things that they cant control we all need to realize that we cant control life. Things happen theres no stopping it. In the end we just need to accept what has happened. We may not like it sometimes but if you just accept it then you can move on to the next thing. Look forward to somethign better. I was always tryin to control what happened. I wanted things to go my way or I wasnt having it. I learned the hard way that it doesnt work like that. People please dont take this the wrong way. I am not sayin I am better than you or that I have been through more than you. I am just tryin to help people out. I am tryin to open everyones minds up a bit. Tryin to make things go your way doesnt work believe me. Like tryin to get someone that doesnt like you or doesnt want to be with you. Stop look at the situation and move on. There are plenty more. Things like tryin to make everyone beleive that you have worse problems than them. You dont know that. You may have bad problems in life but you never know if someone has worse. Dont think that life is against you. Tell you the truth the way I see it its against everyone. We all need to work together to get through it all. We all need to just see that life goes its own way. If we work hard at something we feel can become better than work harder. Like getting a raise at work, bringing your grades up, or ever making someone feel special in a way, letting someone know how much you care for them. Things like that. If we all gave each other compliments each day instead of the usual dirty look or bad remark i think things will get better. If people stopped judging people without knowing them dam you might meet someone incredible. Get to know someone let them show you there true side. We all hide from others, we all put on a different side when we first meet someone. It happens its who we are. But get to know someone by talking to them. Dont listen to what other people say cause you never know they may be lying. Know someone before you judge them. If I had judged the people I know before I met them I wouldnt have the friends I have now. If I had and this is nothing against her or even at that sayin anything but if I had listened to what everyone said about my girlfriend that she moves from guy to guy. If i had listened to that and not takin the chance i did take on asking her out then I would never of fallen in love. I would of never seein gods most beautiful angel. If I had listened to everyone that told me I was being a jerk to a friend that liked her for reasons unlike mine I dont think I would of been together with her as long. I dont think that she would of fallen for me. In which i thank god for. I have never felt anything like the feelings that i have for her. If I hadnt listened to my own mind if i hadnt let things get to me mabe i dont knwo but mabe we wouldnt of broken up when we did. We are back together now and I wont let anything get in the way anymore. I love her dearly and i wont let that change. We need to listen to our hearts not our minds. Our hearts know what we truely want not the mind. The mind questions alot. The mind doesnt focus like the heart. I am no better than anyone else. I complain about thigns that i want to. I want somethigs that i knwo i cant have too. Hell if you want to know wat one is heres one. I wish that I could know what it is that my girlfriend was feeling. If she feels that something is different. I wish she would tell me if she has doubts or anythign like that. I wont ask her and if you read this babe thats just a wish. I dont want you to tell me if you dont want to. I dont doubt our relationship at all. I want to be together for as long as possible."

"event","I have been thinking way to much lately. I feel confused about things. Confused on what to do about my life. Things with jamie are good. I love her and I hope not to lose her. The only thing is, is that her mother absolutly hates me. Jamie and her mom get in fights all the time now and I feel like I am the cause of all of it. I hate the fact that they fight about me and the situation at hand. I really do care for jamie with all my heart and I wont ever give up on our relationship. She means the world to me. She is my everything. I dont know wat is gonna go on with us. I hope we can get through all this. She is so beautiful, radiant, gorgeous, and very down to earth. Every time I see her my heart jumps. Everytime we hold hands my mind starts to race. Everytime we kiss time seems to slow down and my mind clears. When ever I spend time with her all my aches and pains go away. My mind clears and becomes more focused. I feel like a real person, someone that is worth atleast something. It may not be much that I am worth I know I am not worth all that much to many people. But with her I feel that I am atleast worth just a little bit. I feel like I can actually say I am a real person a man. That feeling is great and unbelievable. She has the beauty that surpasses angels and the goddess aphrodite. She is a most precious soul. She deserves the world. I want to give her the world no matter the cost of money or time. I want to go out and see the world and I hope that mabe just mabe she will be there by my side. I want to show her that she is worth everything and worth loving. I want her to know that she is beautiful and I want to show her off to the world no matter what she looks like cause to me she is always beautiful. I dont care what my friends say about me spending as much time with her as I can. I dont care if they call me names or say that I am dropping them for her. I am not dropping them for her I want to bring her into my life. Have her hangout with us every once in a while. I do love my girlfriend and I want her to know how much I love her. It may be something wierd to know how much someone loves you and it may be frightening. But my love is true. My love is pure. I would give my life for her if it meant that she will be saved and able to live her life. I was afraid at first to love her cause I didnt know if my love would be accepted. If it would be seen and known. I was afraid and now I am not. I am afraid for her to break up with me and hating me in the end. I am afraid that if something happens in which i hope nothing does that she will hate me. I love you jamie with all I have. I would never ask you to show me your love or to tell me how you feel about me. I know you dont get attached to someone. I know you dont tell them how you feel. I would never ask you to explain cause I know that you atleast have some feelings for me. You say you love me and that is more than enough. I would never doubt that love. I would never question it. I dont want to."

"event","Well alot of shit is happening. I am able to see jamie which is awesome. Her mother knows that we are gonna hangout now so its great. But the thing is that her mother absolutly hates me. A good part of it is due to things i did myself. But I know that a great part of it has to do with backus's jealousy. In his jealousy he told her things about me that probly werent true at all. I wish i could fix things and let her know that i am not a liar or a bad person. I think my friends are starting to doubt me too. My work is starting to suck again. I am just tryin to get through all this shit. The only thing that keeps me goin is jamie. I love her with all i have."

Work is good cause I got more hours which means more money. I am gonna get my car inspected this week. Hopefully she will pass inspection. I have decide that I am gonna save some cash for a down payment and get a new car. I am gonna ask my mother to co-sign on a car loan with me. If she does I believe that I will be able to get a new car. I am gonna try and get a truck. I dotn want to drive a car anymore. I love trucks and I can get it better pimped than i can my car. So in anycase. I am trying for a truck and I am able to see my girl alot more. I am as happy as they get."

"event","How can I tell you, how much I really love you?
Words of romance, spoken just for you.
The crispness, of each new day's beginning,
Falling in love, again once more with you. 

How can I tell you, how much I really love you?
Without the songs, written throughout all time.
Empty gongs, without a sense of rhythm,
Endless noise, with lyrics that now don't rhyme.
 
How can I tell you, how much I really love you?
Mere existence, if you weren't here with me.
Your soft touch, releasing my heart's passions,
Your caress, opening my eyes to see.
 
How can I tell you, how much I really love you?
Your splendour, words just can't describe.
Captured in, the crimson of the sunset,
Overshadowed, by the beauty you have inside.
 
I love you.....


A poem for my beautiful girlfriend. Jamie I love you babe. I will always be here no matter how hard things get."

Mabe if she wants to she can come over here every once in a while. I dont know if that will work though. But if it does I will be happy cause I will be able to see her. I love her dearly and I wont let anythign get in the way of our relationship. If she doesnt want her mother to know fine. If she is willing to be with me than everything is good. I love her I truely do. I wont let her go. I cant let her go. WEll confusion is setting in and I am kinda goin haywire."

Then I woke up before she could give me an answer. Sorta bummed taht I didnt get to see what she said lol. But mabe its a forsight to the future. Mabe its just what i want to happen really badly. Either way I know I love her. With all my heart and soul. I cant imagine being with anyone else but her. She makes me happy. Something I have never felt. She is my one true love."

"event","I am feeling kinda down about things. I havent seen my girlfriend in almost two weeks. I have a 166 dollar ticket i gotta pay. Stupid connecticut cops. lol. I have been working my ass off at work and not even been recognized for it. I am kinda just upset really. The plans that I do make kinda get messed up all the time. I wanna see my girlfriend I love her dearly and I miss her. I cant go over to her house and see her cause her mother doesnt know yet. Its all good with me. When my Jamie is ready to tell her mother then she is ready. And I will be right there afterwards to explain myself and to prove myself. I want to be with jamie for the longest time possible. I would love it if we could see each other alot more. I would love it if we stayed together for more than a year cause then I would feel that we could do 2 or more. I would love to spend my life with her. I know its a bit early to say and I probly shouldnt say it. But I would give her the world. I would love to be with her for the rest of my life. She is amazing and an angel. The things that I feel are amazing. The feelings that I have for her are true. I have never felt like this before not for anything. Ever since my father died I just lost all my emotions. All my heart was black and cold. I didnt want to be in a relationship cause I feared pain and rejection. I was afraid of people. Afraid of what they thought of me. So I kept to myself. I always kept to myself. I almost killed myself once and never thought twice about it. I was alone depressed and scared. When I graduated I was gonna leave. Somewere I dont know were but somewere. I waited a couple of days after I graduated cause my friend wanted me to go to his party. So I waited. I am most thankful I did cause that day I was ready to leave after the party. Then all of a sudden I saw her. I saw Jamie. I couldnt keep my eyes off of her. I was mesmorized. It wasnt till we were at her uncles house that nite that I realized that all my depression was gone and I was actually happy. Genuinly happy. I felt amazing. So that nite I decided I had to get to know her. I had to see if I had a chance. I didnt feel that I did but I couldnt let her go. I couldnt let the chance go. So on the fourth of July that year I asked her out. She said yes and everything in my life turned around since that day. I was happy for once. I cared for someone truely cared for her. I wasnt afaid or scared. Only scared to lose her. We had great times and a couple of problems. I didnt have a job or a car. My friend backus who liked her sister then her was extremly upset. But I didnt care cause I had found the one I wanted to show my love for. I wanted her to know me. To see me for real. Things got a bit complicated and we broke up. There was to much drama with the whole backus thing and someone told her family that I was flirting with a bunch of girls when we were together. I wasnt I swear on my fathers grave I wasnt. I knew she had somethigns in her head too that she needed to figure out. I had somethings in my head to. So we broke up. I was devasted but I knew it was for the best. 2 months we werent together. 2 months my life turned the other way again. But I found out what was wrong in my head. I was afraid that I loved her to much. That I had fallen for someone that couldnt love me back. I was wrong. I am glad I was wrong. We stopped talking for like a month. But then we started  talking again. I told her how I felt. How much she meant to me. She told me she missed me and that she wanted to be with me again. She told me I would have to wait for the right moment when things were in the clear. I told her I would wait forever for another chance to prove my love. 2 days before my birthday I asked her out again. She said yes and things were once again perfect. I was happy again and I was focused. I told her that I would get a job very soon. That I would be able to take her out this be able to spend money on her. She told me she didnt care about money. I got a job. I work at town fair tire as a tire changer in westspringfield. I got my car back. We are now in two months back together. I love her so much. I am so afraid to lose her. I cant lose her again. I promised myself that watever comes up I will never give up. I wont. When she finally decides to let her family know that we are back together I will prove to them that I can be the man they want her to have. I will spend a fortune on her. I will get her watever she desired. I will prove to them that I do love her. And that I would never cheat or never want another girl. She is perfect everythign that I could wish for. I know I sound sappy but I really do care for her. I really do. I would do anything for her. I would give my life if it meant saving hers. I want her to be happy and thats what I want. I dont want her for sexual reasons. I dont think like that. I want to be with her for the fact that she makes me happy. That I love her with all my heart. And that she loves me back. I could explain everythign about her that makes me stop breathing but I dont have all the room I need. I LOVE YOU JAMIE with all my heart and soul. My heart was torn and scared all my life. I was played by many girls. My mind twisted into a knot by those girls. But ever since we started dating my heart began to heal. And my mind is unraveling. I believe destiny brought us together. I believe it was fate that we got back together. I love you so much."

"event","Yea i was supposed to go to the movies on yesterday with jamie and ellen and some dude that ellen knows. That got messed up because jamie couldnt go out anywere because of the snow. I got alot of thoughts in my head. I always wonder if the things I want most and the things that that make me happy are supposed to last. I have come to realize that everything that has gone wrong in my life is due to me. If I was smart I would still be working at the cracker barrell. If i wasnt so lazy I would of graduated with good grades. If I hadnt said anything if I had kept my mouth shut I might not of lost my girlfriend for the time I did. I dont know anymore. I see things differently now. Things seem a little off beat. I cant seem to focus my mind anymore. I feel lost and out of place. I have my girlfriend Jamie back and I couldnt ask for anything more. I am happy and feel like someone again. But sometimes I feel like I am not worthy. I dont have a job or money and it seems that people think I am nothing. I shouldnt let it get to me and I dont know why i do. I do love her with all my heart and I will be able to show her a great time soon enough. I will have a job soon. I will be able to take her out and buy her things. I will one day show up at her door with a rose in hand. I think she would be in shock if i did that. I feel that she loves me and she says she does. I know I can be a good boyfriend to her. I amy not be a great person but I wanna be the best for her. If I had all the money in the world I would give all away if it meant that we could be together. My happiness is not a concern anymore because being with her makes me happy. All I want is for her to be happy. I am gonna surprise one day with flowers alot of floweres. I am gonna make it so that when she comes home and opens the door there are loads of them all over her house. She deserves the best. I hope that I wont lose her again cause I know I can be a good boyfriend to her. I know I can show her alot of good things. Wow it seems all I do is talk about her huh. Sorry for the people who read these things. I know I talk aobut her alot but thats because I truely care for her."

"event","Today has been very very stressfull. My mother has been home sick and she makes me feel like a fucking idiot sometimes. When she asks me for help she tells me I am doing it wrong and that I need to do this or that. I swear to god I am gonna flip on her sometime soon. Bruces kids (my moms boyfriend) are getting on my nerves. I am gonna strangle them. Chelsea is 11 and she thinks that she is better than everyone. I am gonna boot her in the face soon. Nathaniel is a good kid but he is getting just as bad as his sister. You know how it is monkey see monkey do. I need to get away. I need to go out somewere I dont know were. I wish my girlfriend jamie could come over I know that would come me down alot. Well I hope that I dont have a nervous break down."

"event","Its 1131 at nite. I cant really sleep cause I have so many thoughts on my mind. I keep thinking about my life. I have been through so many things. I am a person that feels like I am seperate from everyone else in this world. Sometimes I feel like as if I was meant to be someone that is supposed to help people. Then I look back and see that alot of the people that I have helped have stepped all over me. I am not complaining just thoughts. The one thing I think most about is my girlfriend Jamie. When we were first dating it was amazing. I found someone that was willin to be with me. Someone to share my feelings with. When we broke up I was so upset at myself. I had lost someone very special and important. I wished everyday that I could turn back the hands of time to try and change things around. I would of never said anythign I said and never would of broken up. I wished each day that I could get another chance. I finally have my second chance. I really dont want to mess things up. I know people say that I might not be in love with her and that I dont know what love is. No I am in love with her. Everyone has there own definition of love. I know what love is. If I didnt I wouldnt say it to my family. I care for her alot. She tells me that she loves me and that I believe. I am a firm believer in destiny and fate. I believe that it was destiny that we met and I believe that it was fate that we are together. She was meant to be in my life. They say you only get three great ones. Its up to you to chose which one is best for you. I say you chose but not which one is the best rather which one you would do absolutly anythign for. I am not some kinda freak that says that he wants to marry someone early off in the relationship. I am not one of those guys who gets seriously obsessed. I am one of those people that feels that it takes time and patience when it comes to a relationship. I believe that only time will tell if the relationship is supposed to last. I am more than willing to spend the time to see if mine and Jamies relationship last. I do love her. No one and I mean no one can say other wise. You wanna know my reasoning and my definition. Ok. I love her because when ever I am around her when ever I talk to her I have no more worries in my head. My mind and all the thoughts just shut down and focus on her. When ever I see her I get butterflies in my stomach and my heart races. I think she is gorgeous. Her personality is marvoulus. Her voice is that of sirens beautiful and mesmorizing. Her eyes I love her eyes. The one thing that makes me love her is who I am now. If I had not met her I would of been someone completly different. I love who I am now and who I am when I am with her. I love who she is and who she is when she is with me. Nothing anyone says to me can make me change my feelings for her. This probly sounds like a sappy love message to a girl from a guy. No I am just writing down my thoughts. Simple as that."

"event","Today was a great day. I got to see my girlfriend Jamie which I was most happy seeing her. She beat the crap out of me with one hand cause she had surgery on the other one.lol. But its all good I still love her either way. I got to spend pretty much the entire day with her it was great. I had to drive home in wat I call a quick one day blizzard from hell. I alomst got stuck on the way home. I almost got in like 2 accidents.lol. This big ole propane truck almost hit this chik in a truck tryin to turn around and I almost hit the propane truck. It wasnt a fun experience. But I am happy cause I got to see my girlfriend and thats all that mattered today."

"event","Yea so today is sunday. I am bored and I have nothing to do. I applied at subway for a job. Hey its a job for now right. I hope that I do get this job it will get my cougar back on the road and I will be able to bring my angel out every once in a while. Stcc sent me something yesterday. I am gonna go to college in september for Auto Mechanics it seems. I hope I do. It will be awesome if I get into that. I will be able to become a mechanic making money alot of money after just 2 years. I keep hearing things about mine and jamies realationship. It seems people dont really like the fact that we are together. I guess people dont think I am good enough to be with her. Because I have no money. No car. I cant take her out. And I cant buy her gifts. All that does make a difference I know. But why dont you people and you know who you are if you read this just let her make the decision by herself. I love her with all my heart. I know people say that I truely didnt care for her when we were dating before. Thats all a lie. I fell in love with her. I fell in love with her the first day we met. People also need to leave her alone about our relationship. If you got something to say about me dont say it to her. Say it to me man to man face to face. I wont hit you or get upset at you. Instead I truely pity all that have something against us. I pity you because you just cant seem to accept that we are happy together. I dont know how she truely feels about our relationship and me. But that doesnt matter. I would never ask her to explain herself. She tells me she loves me thats all I need. I believe her. So in all this drama and shit that has been goin on. Let it go people. You got better things to do than try to ruin jamie's and my relationship. I love her isnt that all that counts."

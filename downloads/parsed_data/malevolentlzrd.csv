I'm not obviously one of the Christian faith but I remember hearing a hymn or sermon in a church when I was younger that saying and I didn't know exactly what it meant at the time. I thought it had to do more with greed than anything.

So this past week, if  I decided to give it a theme , it would  more than likely called the week of awckardness. My best friend finally came back to Louisiana, only to find out that he had to go to court and has failed to call our boss at the faire, so I told them hey Jake's back and they flip because they could of used his help this week. This is why sometime's I feel like his wife. I have to remind of his duties or his responsibilities. Just common sense shit.

Then at the faire I started getting a crazy migraine and I knew right away something was wrong. More like someone was really tense and I knew I didn't want to be there. Turns out 2 of my friends(One I've known for years and the other is one from the faire who I became really good friends with since last year.)  get into a major blow out brawl on their anniversary none other. I'm caught in the middle of hearing this shit and there's another couple going through the exact same shit so i just end up hearing all this shit that has no direct effect on me but is giving me a fucking headache. At one point one of the girl's said she was stressed the other night and felt the need to scream and felt better afterwards. What?!  You've got to be kidding me! I've never had to do that or even feel the need to. 
  The main problem with both couple's is the lack of communication, actually nobody actually took the time to even really listen to each other, everyone of them was demanding to be heard and to be respected, all thought they were right and they were all wrong. I don't understand that out of 4 people (3 who are older than me)who dated each other not one has caught on to what it takes to be in a long lasting relationship. Don't get me wrong I'm still single but I know what it takes and I also know that at this time, I just wanna have fun and not have that in my life. 
 So what does that have to do with the saying I refered to earlier in this post. I'm glad I'm comfortable with who I am, that I don't allow petty shit to get to me, that even when I'm mad I can at least tell myself to try to see the other person's point of view, and finally I'm that I have my own place cuz if you do get on my nerves i can just kick your ass out."

"event","So I have been away for awhile and that happens pretty much once a year where I tend to disappear and get away from everyone, just cuz I like being alone for a little. Most recently because of seeing that everyone I come across dumps all thier problems on me, the expect me to have some magicl answer for them , when the damed answer was in thier face the whole friggin time. 
 Here's a fine example, just the other day my little sister the drama queen dumps the problem on my lap and my dad and step mother's that one of her neighbors is hitting on her even though he's realy in a bad relationship and has a kid to the woman, and she's talking about how much she gives him a headache. Here's when I get disgusted and just verbally assaulted the shit out of my sister. I reply to her that the obvious thing to do is to remind the neighbor that she is married, and there is nothing she can do for said neighbor and if he persists just keep reminding him that she is married. He can't have her she is taking. What made it ridiculous is the whole time she's talking about this said conversation not once did she remind the guy of what I would think would be the ending to such a ridiculous saga. I finally flipped on my sister and yelled at her that she is a moron for loving nothing more than to attract some serious drama bullshit, and that she needs to stop watching Soap Opera's. ""Are you fucking serious?! Are you for real?! Hello?! Just remind him your married and stop leading him on, you did the same shit with that guy I knew and then ran to me for help. Stop being such a spotlight whore and you wouldn't have these problems""

 Remember my last entry when I was in shick because I didn't get fired for calling my boss an asshole , finally that little bitch a week later fired me, so for the most part I have been having fun hanging with friends and doing some part time work. Odd isn't it? That when you should be your most stressed out (i.e being a single female, in your own place and then losing your job) your at most free."

"event","I was laughing my ass off last weekend as I walked out of my office and out into the night. I had just called my boss an asshole to his face. He happen to make a rude ass comment that I don't do my job. I sit here all day on the fucking computer and call business now granted I don't get the highest numbers (as I would like them to be)but all my shit closes. Last month alone I made enough money for the company to compensate for 2 people's salary. I feel no remorse in standing my ground and pointing that fact out after calling him an asshole. Surprisingly I'm still not fired.

 I hung out with my ex boyfriend on Sat. night only to get happy drunk, get  hit on by one of his friends and call my ex drunk demanding the new cute boy's number.

 Went to go swimming this weekend and my strap broke,of course having huge boobs like mine this doesn't surprise me, I grab my old swim suit thinking I could still fit in it. Well I can with the bottom part at least, this then leaves me no choice but to swim in a bra. I forgot there was a small tear above my left breast on the bra, thus showing a little more cleavage than I care to endure.

 Not to mention Chris a couple of weeks ago,making me very flushed as he kept hitting on me all night and kept grabbing my ass. Like a jackass I allowed him to crash at my place,which ended up me staying up all night making sure he doesn't try any more moves on me and making sure I knew where my daggers were.(worst case scenario)
 
 I've become fed up with myself and the stupid shit I allow to happen in my life.
 I thought about the last guy I really fell for and remembered how many times he said I wasn't for him,then we kiss, how it would never work, then have sex. The fucking yo-yo factor I got tired of very quickly and I caught it enough time to stop it from happening again,that only worked for like a month, he finally gave me a big fuck you and here I am online,feeling more furious and crushed then before. Defeat is something I don't bow down to,but I have no choice, I have to leave it all go."

"event","I'm being watched at my job, because me going on to MySpace apparently causes viruses. I don't know shit about computers, but I'll say that this is utter bullshit. I also understand that while I have the shitiest job in the company,I don't feel that I should be treated like the fucking janitor. The fact that the secretary is gone and everbody else is ""too busy doing my job"" to answer the fucking phone drives me nuts. I have to now cut into my time doing my job to do what boss man said was to be everyone's responsiblities.
 
I've gotten more frustrated with hummanity as a whole than I ever had. I don't remember how it begun, but it's gotten really nasty really quick. I've become very anti-social at work even with clients. I have no desire to do my job anymore. I have no desire to do anything at this point. 

 The best thing that has happened recently is that Kelly Jawnz gave me a much needed make-over. After the past couple of months where I was living one person's lifetime in the span 2 mos, I've become so drained. I don't know if I just need to relax, quit my job, or become a hermit? I was taught at a very young age that I needed to be mature and responsible for myself once I got out in the real world, the only problem is I never had time to be a kid from age 14 and up. So now all I want... is to play hookie from work, to not have to worry about bills and keep my awesome apt., to just go away like I did some years ago to some random fucking state where I only know like 1 or 2 people and just hang there for a while.

I heard this poem this weekend and 2 lines really stuck out to me. 
-May you have sorrows to make you more human
-May you have mistakes to make you more humble.

I laughed as this poem was read aloud and commented ""If sorrows make me more human. Than I'm more Human than Human. Mistakes don't make humbleness, mistakes make you learn, but you can always be a cocky son of a bitch""

Something funny did happen however this weekend. I ended up without even trying getting a rent-a-boyfriend. We hang out, we tell people we're seeing each other, we hold hands at shows and other events where the public is involved, then we get sloppy drunk and pass out next to each other. Meantime no heavy petting,kissing or sex is involved. The weekday comes and we're off to work only calling each other once during the week to make sure what we're doing that following weekend. It's perfect. It looks and sounds like I'm dating some awesome guy but with no strings attached and no love involved so nothing goes horribly wrong. Why hasn't anyone thought of this before!"

"event","Thursday was cloudy and miserable in general. I've been sick for a week, and I finally have no choice but to face reality, I might have cancer. I try to see the plus side of it. I'll lose weight, My hair will be thinner( hey maybe even a new haircut), and I will possibly never be able to give birth. Like I would care. I don't plan on having children anyways. As I walk towards the double doors of the docs office that I visit today I realize my breathing is becoming very shallow, I'm finding it harder to breathe. Is It because I'm scared or is it the fact that my nose is stuffy? Of all things in my life that I had to face usually by myself, Thursday was a day that I don't want to face at all. I wished that one of my good friends would be here to hold my hand but knowing when it came time for the testing it wouldn't of mattered they wouldn't be allowed in. I was scared shitless for the first time in a long time. 
The doc enters the room, I think I served him bagels everyday when I worked at the deli about 2 blocks away from where I was standing that day. He's older and british, surprisngly he has nice teeth, or maybe they are dentures. He talks to me for a bit , he explains what going to happen next and goes through out the scenarios depending on my results. He start to work, I look at the nurse present in the office, She glances down at me and asks is I'm sick.
I nod yes. "" oh that explains why you look so pale!"" I chuckle "" No it doesn't."" I reply in a monotone voice.
 She and the doc glance at each other for a second. I'm going to have a biopsy. The nurse grabs my hand, she realizes I started shaking. At this moment I'm thinking I will join my aunt and uncle. I will die of cancer. I'm so young in years but I lived a very full life in such a short amount of time, there's more I want to do though. I wonder if they have a make- a- wish foundation for adults. (mind you I'm thinking about this in the span of 5 minutes) I wanna go to Ireland, No Wait!! I wanna meet John Fruscainte, No Wait!!!! I wanna go on tour one last time, No I wanna get laid by some really hot model guy that will never have the chance with had it not be for the fact that I have cancer!!!! the doc looks up at me, For a split second I'm thinking did I say any of these thoughts aloud. ""Well Dear you don't have cancer."" Wait huh?! "" You don't have cancer, you don't have pre-cancer, from the looks of it, you have a common virus that if ignored for 5 years could lead to cancer, we caught it so early you have nothing to wrry about.""  Whaddya mean I have a virus? I was tested 2 mos ago and the results came back fine! ""I will assume dear that you have had sex with more than one guy more than once."" Uh well yeah!  ""Well it's a common thing dear, you can be a virgin and then have sex with one guy, only once, with a condom and still catch the virus, it's relatively harmless and most women have it. You shouldn't be alarmed just because I said it's a virus but that's what it is."" Uh well viruses are usually a bad thing doc.  ""Oh yes indeed very much so, but this was caught early enough in time, that you coudln't even get sick from it. Are you ok???""
 By this time I'm sitting up I have my face in my hands and you can see again that I'm breathing heavy.  I don't know whether to cry or just start breathing again. It feels like I've been under water for the longest time, staying there to I almost run out of breath, and now I'm finally up for air.  ""Mrs.Roman are you ok?!"" Yeah, so I can smoke and not have to worry?  "" well how many do you smoke a day?"" About 6 or 7 daily  ""Then your fine. You see the magic number you should be concerned about is 15. If you smoke that many a day, there would be a concern,but we can't prove that how many you smoke actually does any real harm.""  No shit? Good Cuz I need a cigarette right now! The doc gives me this perplexed look. Well hell you told me 2 mos. ago that i might have cancer and I needed a smoke then, then you tell me the day of my procedure, that the machine broke, I needed one then too and now I have nothing to worry about, I'm relieved, I need a cigarette.
 The doc laughs and tells me to get dressed and go pay my bill, the worst is over. I'm ok (I promise)"

"event","So to put it mildly before I get out my ninja swords. The fucking machine at the goddamn doctors broke,So now I have to wait another fucking 2 weeks just to get tested to see how bad the fucking cancer is and then wait 2 more weeks for the goddamn results. The ironic part is they must be damn lucky I'm not drinking. I swear like this all the motherfucking time.

So as for my 3 cheers for sweet revenge story I ran into someone last night that made me very happy for clearing up some things.
 No I'm not giving details out... not yet,I wanna see where this is going, no real reason to get all excited only to get let down in the end.
 So tonight for 2nd time in a row this week I'm heading to York. I think that's gonna be my new hang out spot, New people and more fun. Parents anniversary. Holy shit how can 2 people not only love each other but live under the same damn roof for 25 years. I can't imagine. My oldest relationship with anyone is faded, he's engaged and too far to even call or see on a daily basis. 
 I wonder if anyone else has seen the change in the tides,. how people just naturally tend to drift off somewhere. Soon it will be my turn."

 You goddamn humans with your fucking emotions, glad I'm an android aka not human I couldn't even begin with all the troubles you all have. The only emotion I have that resembles yours is anger.
 With that said, Ben now has a new girlfriend. And it's all good considering he came to me and asked for a card reading. I saw this coming. I remember specifically telling him this female wouldn't be from around this area and she would change him but not in a bad way. She would be good for him.  Yet I despise her. It's nothing she did to me but she denied me the good sex I was having. Damn It! I had a good thing going. Ben and I went out, had a drink or 2, watch Carnivale and then have good sex. It was great. Yeah I know It sounds like I'm being a slut, No not even. I was comfortable with the relationship I had with him and I won't have that again. Therefore I'm  not liking the new chick. 

 I really want to just take a week off and head off to some other state to relax. I don't care if I just sleep all day and then head out to local bars all night. Just something better than being in town. 

I find it odd I have people actually calling me to go out. What?! You actually want to hang with me? Why?

 Oh and I quit drinking again. I made it past a week and a half last time which was only like 2 weeks ago, but I realized my tolerance for alcohol and drunks have gone to shit. I used to be more laid back but I don't know what happened. eh I need a vacation"

"event","So for the past couple of weeks Ben and I started talking again. 
 He failed to tell me that he was seeing other woman again and I felt a little hurt by this. So much so that one night while being piss drunk I called him at 3am and asked how his date was going. Apparently this is all I said. You know me well enough this is like the mildest insult I could ever give other than my personal favorite ""your mom"". Ben took this very personally and e-mailed me on myspace letting me know that his date went ""swimmingly"" Later he called me and also said he felt the need to leave a smart ass remark on my phone. I had enough of him and his snide remarks.   
 Feeling like a yo-yo with him drove me to finally say I have had enough. So last night while at the M.C chris show I had the feeling he would show up and for the past couple of days have talked to numerous friends about the situation. It was agreed by all that Ben is not good for me in any circumstance. Sure enough I was right, he showed up and acted like everything is cool. Well my luck changed! 
 My friends backed me up and I was surprised that so many people that were at the show as well pointed out that ben was there and asked if I wanted them to get rid of him. I decided no, I could handle my own. Then Mike Casey's woman (anya) points out a very cute friend of hers and let me know he was asking about me. Damn ain't I the lucky one indeed?! Hell yeah I got a number and I think we made out in the chameleon in front of ben. I was trashed at this point so I don't really remember.  

 Oh yeah and this is the coolest thing of all. Yesterday while at work I went to giant for lunch and ordered a sandwich like no other. Without thinking about it I ordered a Broodwich! Well the only thing that was missing was the bacon. Yes there was even Sundried tomatoes on it! and i ate the bitch well at least half of it. ha how cool is that going to M.c Chris and having a broodwich. I think there should be a Aqua Teen Hunger Force party and the broodwich should be the appetizer! That would own. 
 This weekend should be fun, the foxx is coming down and i think we are going to do a shoot. I'm going to a boxing party (whatever the hell that is) and I'm thinking of asking the new boy to join moi! Painting eggs with the fam. I have no clue where I'm going to be for Easter seein I forgot about it in the first place. eh who knows. If it's nice enough I might just ride the bike somewhere that day."

"event","I originally wanted to post something I wrote years ago that I thought was funny. Very recently a more pressing issue has come to surface and I feel the need to rant. I'm goin through some serious bullshit at my job. The dilemma I have is deciding if I should move on or just tough it out here. I have a serious with problem with local businesses because most of the owners always think they have all their shit together and listen to noone else but themselves. Don't get me wrong I'm a big fan of confidence but I loathe pride.It's even worse when it's a family owned business. In the past 10 years I've worked for numerous companies. Some privately owned, some are franchises. I like bigger corporations because they have more benefits and are more flexible, but they usually pay less and try to stick with so many regulations it's ridiculous. In the end you realize how expendable you really are. Seriously who really wants to know that they are never good enough in the eyes of the big boss. Local businesses are fun because usually you get more freedom, if you have something that you think that should be discussed you can walk right up to the boss or whoever you need to with little to no problems and you the usual little perks (i.e bonus check for x-mas). Well as I stated before the owners usually have a huge ego and are too busy with their head stuck up their asses. Understanding that they have probably have worked for ""the man"" before and figure they can do it better themselves seems like a good idea but they many times forget that they are not doing it alone and have a need for a strong back-up team and plan.
  This said I'm very annoyed at the fact that my boss at the current time thinks I'm a blundering idiot. I've have been involved in the sales aspect of companies for about 8 years. I have have built companies up single handedly and watch them fall apart after I chose to left. Currently there is a woman working with me to beef up my sales because of said boss not being happy with how things are going. It's even worse because said woman is said boss's mother. If I have a problem with her accusing me of not doing my job (today she accused me of lying, bitch!), or not knowing what I'm doing I can't confront my manager on this because he will ultimately take this personally. I find it funny he even called his mom. I imagine the conversation goes like this "" mom there's a worker here and she's not doing her job. Can you help me?!"" ""Sure son I'll take care of the nasty witch for you. don't you worry your little head. Now who's my big man?!"" ""I am! thanx mom!""
 This is the way of the world if you refuse to change then everything else around you will and you will be left behind scratching your head trying to desperately figure out what went wrong.
  I strongly believe that said boss made one major wrong move and that was hiring just based on a reference without looking extensively at my resume. Why is that such a bad idea rhea? Because he has no clue of what I have done before and what I can do for his comp.therefore the reason why he thinks I'm an idiot. 
  Man I wish I had a mirror so I could point it at him and point to the real ass in the company."

 All the pics I have from over the years are gone due to assholes stealing my shit or being auctioned off due to negligence (hmmm did I spell that word right?) that which is not my own. So I don't really have anything to reference my life to.
 In any case I wrote something a while ago based on what I could remember. It's kinda universal things but I felt like sharing it with the few people who read my ridiculous shit.
 
 Being so naive to believe in Santa Claus. Your 1st best friend. Chicken pox will take your life of that I am certain. Are you that kid that ate paste or the one that made fun of that kid? Were school lunches ever good? Never wanting summer to end. Hanging by the lake, the few that got to hang with the older crowd. Hating gym class. Time passed you got a little older & a little jaded. Missing nap time, being the most opinionated and the most judge at the same time. If you went to private school you already knew about the uniforms. That weird hair phase (everyone had one). Posters all over your bedroom. Your 1st love letter written with those stupid hearts over the ""i's"", 1st loved letter received with those x's & o's. which one is which?
 Then it finally came to the day you hit the biggest building of them all at the time known as High school. Learning responsibility in the form of Home Ec. Saying goodbye to your beloved trapper keeper. figuring things to doodle while you hear another speech. First love and the speech that follows after that. ""This won't last"" The lockers were always either too small or some gawd awful color weren't they? Skipping class to do something more ""productive"", Cliques,Cliques,Cliques.Backpack really killing my back. Smoking either behind the school or in the bathroom. Which one did you do? The eternal question what are you gonna do with your life. Such a bullshit answer that by the time graduation hits you are no longer near that goal. So what does the future hold for you? Work, Military or even more school. It almost time to leave you feel elated, but somehow you feel you should made more of a statement. They say it's time to move on come on lets go, the only option I chose was to float on."

"event","Well not only was last week hell, but the beginning of this week definitely made me reevaluate moving to San Diego.
 By now you should know about a good friend Eric who last week decided to commit suicide. It's hard to believe that someone who was always there in your time of need, one of the first to give you a hug and reassure you that things would get better decided to take his life. One would think that when you already lost so many people in your life due to many factors from car accidents to diseases to drownings and even suicide that you would either go numb or just in general get used to saying goodbye. It doesn't happen that way. Although I'm upset that he's gone, I'm more pissed than anything on the route he took. The funeral is tomorow, I'm bracing myself now as I type this.
 Moving on to more interesting news. I found out Wed. that I might have cancer of the cervix. Yay! yet another thing to add on my ""wtf"" list. I haven't told many people yet just because of what else has been goin on. I don't know if I want to yet either. It's weird. The tests results came back inconclusive, they say it's not cancer but then again they won't know until closer examination and that won't happen to April because they are booked as is. Ok as morbid as this sounds, I could deal with the fact that I had cancer. I'm at higher risk because my family has a long history of cancer. It's the unknown I'm not happy about. It could be something I will have for the rest of my life. I don't know much about health related issues except for diet and exercise. I thought about it. If I have to have chemo,good I have way too much thick hair anyways, I loose a significant amount of weight and most likely become sterile (meaning never have children). I made these comments to a friend of mine last night and he gave me the weirdest look. He said ""I never heard someone so optimistic about having cancer!"" Well what choice do I have?! I'm tired of moping around as is and no one is gonna look after me, I have no choice but to take care of myself by being as positive as I can possibly be.
 Hey this isn't all bad news. I might get my Kaylee this weekend and Jessie and I decided to go to San Diego for vacation in May. So that is definitely a reason to kick the shit out of whatever I have, remain focused and stay positive."

Ok once again yeah I'm pagan, but waving my wand doesn't do shit to them. I simply did nothing more than just hang out with him and listen to what he has to say. How in the world is that conjuring up a false image of someone I don't know.
 I really do miss him already. I can't just hang around and hope that things will get better in his personal life and not drag me down.
 So what do you do when this happens? You call your ex who your still good friends with! You talk about stupid shit and laugh about it. You then dwell on why the hell you two broke up in the first place. You realize it's a repeating pattern. You break up with the ones that could possibly be the closest ever to you. And so yes I called Ryan. Gawd I miss that punk! hehe
He's still hot! (fucker!) and his daughter is getting so super cute (like she wasn't in the first place. Coincidentally it also happens to be our year anniversary. One year ago to the date we met at our favorite bar,all thanx to his ex brother in law and his ex-wife.
  Odd isn't it how life repeats itself."

"event","Well I have to say guttentag to some people that currently are in my life and shouldn't be.
I decided that it would be this week to tell them. This is sad they never did anything to hurt me per se',but they did. 
When they are happy, I'm happy. When they cry, I cry.
Some would say oh your in love or oh you guys just live parallel lives. No It's not that at all! I don't want to feel what they feel all the fucking time, I want to get on with my life and I want them learn period! 
  I'm tired of the expression ""you are so easy to talk to"" why?! I can't be the only sucker who is willing to listen. There's a gajillion of you guys on live journal alone! 
  I love my life, really I do I've been doing really well for myself the past couple of months. I finally decided to get off my ass and fix what's wrong in my life. What I don't get is what takes people so long to do just that!  
  I mean yeah I'm pagan but a wave of my wand is not going to save your ass!
 This shit frustrates me soo much not only because of the people involved but I, myself have been mulling over this decision for a while. I don't want to lose the relationship with these people but I can't hang onto it either. I know it will be better in the end but the goodbye part itself is gonna kill me. I should be use to this. I'm a phoenix, I rise from the ashes everytime, something new,refreshed ready to take on whatever comes my way. 


Goodbye lover, goodbye friend. I'm sorry"

Another week of boring ass job.
 I feel as wound up as a freaking clock spring for no reason other than, I hate my job.
 I haven't had this much hate in me for a long time.
 Ben is being moody! He likes to take pot shots at me so I just through it back in such a twisted fuck way that he get's thrown off, at least for a little.
 I finally heard from Sara I can get my stuff back anytime now, but I can't remember where her mom lives. oh what the hell!
 Speaking of bad memories, my great uncle died on Monday. My Mom called me to tell me about it and asked if I remember him. My response was ""He Has a wife that's darker than him. That's all I can remember"" He got buried yesterday and of course tons of family was there and asking my mom where was I. Blah, bleh, bleh! I don't know, I'm not much of a family person and if these people wanted to get ahold of me they could but they don't so what do I care. Tired of calling them just to say hi, they assume that I always want something. I never did ask for anything just to clear that up.

 What's goin on you ask?
 Honestly just kinda forgot to ...sorry!
So the past weeks I have had reunions with people which isn't bad this always happens in cycles. Months pass and I hang with the same ol friends then I go out out one week to the same places I always go to and then everyone is there. Drunk Crew, Metal Bros, Dance parnuh's, Diner Buds and Club Hoppers! It's very strange to put them in categories like this but I hang out with these people during very different times in my life,not like I was having an identity crises or anything.
 By the way if you are over 21 and have to deal with obnoxious college kids while standing in line to get in a club, turning around give them the meanest face possible and tell them to shut the fuck up, you'll rip their throats out before they even blink is hilarious! 
 The ex douche has a new g/f. Wow someone is obviously dumber than me! I never called him my boyfriend so that's good! So the new girl got hustled by my friends for $30 and they also told the douche that yeah he is an asshole,(what the hell? Is "" Do you think I'm an asshole"" the only question he ever asks?) followed by the fact the lied and said I have a new boyfriend. Ok The last Phil wasn't my b/f and neither is Ben! I like Ben and all but it's wierd I fully enjoy being single right now! Except you know when there's Soft Core Porn laying around. I kid! I kid!
 Totally different subject. It's time for another vacation. Since I was supposed to take one back in November but didn't because I took the shitty job I have now and didn't got to Florida with Justin like I should have. **muttering** Stupid responsibilties with their freakin maturity shit!!!!
 So now is the question of where should I go? I already did L.a , I promised Sara sometime San Diego, but I don't know if I really want to stay in the states this year. Shit is cheap now in Europe, it's the off season for germany,italy,and ireland right before it hit spring! Hell might be warmer there.
 Enough of the rambling time for a smoke."

"event","So around Thanksgiving time I get a call from my Friend Chris. He's in town and at ""the bar"". I grab my jacket and head out to see him. We play brief catch up as he through out the whole night calls other friends and makes them all come out for a drink. Just like the good ol Punk Rock Days except back then I was underage. Chris recites names off of a invisible list of people I supposedly am to remember, but he forgot I drank a lot of memories (which includes names and faces ) away. This sux, it bothers me that these people who I booked their bands for, who I drank with, and in some cases saved their asses from going to jail I can't recall a name of them or their band, or their face for that matter. Finally one name rings a bell: Ben. I remember always referring him as ""The Drunk Guy"" seeing every time I saw him he wore nothing but black, shades all the time, was intimidating because the man has a gift for words (the man used his lips and tongue prettier than a Water St. whore), and of course drunk. I years later find out that most of the drinking consumed by him was because of nothing more than the fact the he has an anti-social dysfunction. Ben was in a couple of bands that I was friends with and anytime they wanted a show they got one with no problems and for a small fee of oh say... lager or mad dog ( yeah this was a while ago) I would also forget the fact the we deal with only all age shows and therefore alcohol is not allowed. Chris mentions that Ben is one of the people he called and he's coming over soon. ""Soon like now?! Oh shit and I look like hell"" I say to myself. I had a crush on Ben, but never managed to say anything to him because the whole ""I'm drunk and too punk rock for you!"" attitude coming form his side. Which once again I found out years later the ""tude"" also dealt with him being anti-social. As The thoughts of him course through my brain, a slow smile and feeling of warm subsides and i realize I'm literally day dreaming in a bar.I open my eyes just in time. Chris jumps up and waves someone over, I turn to see who it is: It's Ben. He's with other people I know and some god awful looking chick that kinda looks like a Living Dead Doll.  Greeeeaaaaaattttt! I think too myself another punk chick that's he's with I'll never will get my chance. Then the best thing in the world happened. He explains to Chris and myself that the ""Doll"" oops I mean girl is actually my friend Angel's Fiance and then looks over to me has a big smile across his face and says ""Hey Gorgeous!"" followed by the best hug ever received. I'm elated to say the least. Flash Forward to a couple of days after New Year's. I get a strange message on my ""myspace"" account from someone who has a pic of turkey buzzards for their profile. The Subject simply says "" Yarrrrgh!"" I'm thinking what the fuck is this shit, when I open the message I realize it's Ben. My Ben! He somehow found out I'm online and found me to just say hello and invite me over for some GTA action! Sweet I'm all about it. I get his number and leave a message, another weekend passes nothing, I'm upset. What the hell! The guy wants to play video games and can't call back! I call again maybe i dialed the wrong number. I didn't, He answers, apologizes that he couldn't answer the phone because he was at work and cell phones are not allowed. We talk for an hour and he sounds so cool even on the phone. I realize I'm gushing and try to maintain my cool. By the way it never works. We set up hanging out later that even. He calls, I was taking a nap, he feels bad and coos how sorry he is. (HOOOOOTTTTTT!) I reassure him I'm ok, let's just hang damnit! he picks me up and we start chilling by each grabbing a beer and watching the 3 amigos. I know what you're thinking. "" Wow Rhea that's lame"" But NO! I love the 3 amigos, it's one of my favorite of all time! We quote parts of the movie and continue our conversation that we left off on the phone, we drink more and then it's time to pick another movie to watch. I glance over the selection while ben squats in front of me. I notice he has some choice movies which includes Labyrinth, Goonies, and Snatch. I decide on Snatch but before I could say anything Ben turns aorund to face me and plants one right on the mouth. We Kiss!!!! Oh I can't even describe how awesome it was. This of course leads to sex which is better than ever imagined! We end up falling asleep watching Family Guy. Yep weird, awesome first date. We wouldn't of slept with each other, we both said that that was not our intention. We have been seeing each other since. He's helped put my new bed together, we have had many long conversations at random places, we watch Aqua Teen together till the sunrises. Ok so I'm a cheap date, but this sooo makes up for dip shit that I was seeing before this guy. 
Ok I swear I'm done this thing it's way too long."

"event","Sooooo since the last entry I have gone out and done somethings that were cool but mostly funny/confusing events have left me to jot my thoughts down.
 New years led me to some place, way in the country, where amish people dwell way too much but I could get away with screamin like an idiot at some retarded g/f of a friend that she should really not try to mount me and concentrate on how stupid she looks trying to do said act. Also since best bud jakey brung me Jager for x-mas (no it's still not gone!) I decided to bring that down and do as much as I wanted.
 Well forgetting that I am in the country. I hear a weird noise a follow it towards a wooden fence. Not seeing anything at 1am makes me believe that no one is around till I turn. my head more to the right to see a cow staring at me! I jump and scream ""Oh Shit!"" and without really thinking take a swing at the cow. It moos very loudly seeing I punched it in the nose and ran like all hell! I slept with one eye open that night fearing the wrath of the bovine.
 Well next day with the weather being so warm, my buds and I decide to head over to the pinnacle and hang there for a while. Later on that night the girls and I figure we could go for one last drink before we have to work the next day and head to ""our"" bar, and that's when the shit hit the ceiling. 
As we enter we happened to see my ex and his roommate just about to leave. Which one you ask? well the most recent who is a complete idiot. I'm relieved that he is leaving seeing everytime I run into him he has nothing of real value to say to me and asks me about 10-15 times in a night if I think he's an asshole. 
The girls and Myself manage to order a drink and start a round up of touch screen mania when dip-shit walks back in the door. He's drunk. His eyes are glossy and half opened,he sways back and forth. He keeps nudging me only to ask what's up and of course my favorite question. I decide that I could be a little nicer since the only reason I choose not to speak to him is because he sucks in bed. He wants to play a round of darts with the girls: I oblige. We play,we lost, but there was a lite, pleasant conversation involved.  We return to the touch screen.  While all three of us are trying to play, I notice my ex is now nudging one of my friends. I think nothing of it. Then I overhear my friend say ""yeah you kinda are an asshole."" to which the ex replies ""well can you blame me for trying?!""  my ears perk up I look through the corner of my eye as to see what the hell is going on. It hits me like a ton of bricks: My ex is fucking hitting on one of my closest friends while I'm not even 2ft. away!
 I lean over towards them and look him in the eye yelling ""What the fuck is going on?!"" He's now swaying back and forth. My friend suggest that we go, I tell her I have to have a talk with him first. she nods agreeing, I get the hint; he was hitting on her.  Argument ensues. He denies hitting on her, denies that he told her that he dumped me, and denies that he told other male friends of mine that we were dating after the fact that I dumped him.He also prays that I don't punch him. The bar is silent although there are others still drinking. I glare at him and tell him to leave. 
 Ok so why did the little episode bother me. well for one this happens roughly a week after I dump him. If you are a guy and have common sense when the girl you were just seeing is around with her cute friends, you would either approach your ex and let her know about the crush you have and ask them if it's cool or you wait until said ex walks away before you hit on said cute friend. NOT WHEN THEY ARE 18 INCHES AWAY! This led me to two things . He obviously is a bigger idiot than I thought and he blatantly has not dated that much.
well my lunch is getting cold so part 2 will have to wait."

"event","so what to say about x-mas?
well I got stuff I didn't ask for and didn't want like a hat and gloves. why do I want this? I just got a new apartment why the hell do I want a hat and gloves? 
  However 2 people rule this year! My cousin's cuz they got me a brand new stereo which I did really need since my old one was beat all to hell and sold in my old storage unit with kim's stuff as well. And one of best friends Jakey cuz he supplied me with my favorite: Jager and Parrot Bay! 
  I pretty much dumped the last guy since he sucked in all ways possible.
 The new apartment is soooo nice. I have to of course add more things but eventually I'll get there. I brought myslef a phone for the new place Merry x-mas to me!
  Spoke to Ryan he's doin kinda shitty. I jokingly asked if his hair is getting grayer by the minute to which he replied : "" pretty much,yeah!""
 Yeah I know I'm so pathetic I date a guy, dump a guy, and then call up the ex, but I generally do miss Ryan. He's just a good guy, sometimes a little too honest but other than that can't complain. 
 Oh yeah the really funny thing is I don't really celebrate x-mas cuz I'm pagan. I celebrate yule, which is more traditional form . I don't celebrate the birth of jesus, I celebrate the coming of the winter and ahh it's hard to explain without some knowledge of wicca.  So yeah every year I'm forced to deal with x-mas shopping anyways since most of my family has a southern baptist background. I don't even get along with most of my family so why do I deal with this crap? One because people like jake who rule and know me, know how I am supply me with enough alcohol to keep me happy and I can zone out when dealing with them. Second because when I show up it keeps the family happy, I give them a brief idea of what the hell I'm doin and then they leave me alone until they want something again.  
  Ohyeah I'm all about the family life can't you tell?"

It took forever to get to this point but the new job (even though it's a boring one)pays me well enough that I could finally do something. 
 Oh yeah and I have a boyfriend. His name is Phil and he's nothing spectacular. I know that's a mean thing to say but really he doesn't seem to have a real sense of humor, he has no distinguishable features, and well he rather bores me, but there's nothing wrong with being boring I need that balance in my life since the rest of my life is insane.

4) How come Playtex ""Ultra Suppport"" come in boring colors and then are the same price as regular Victoria Secret Bras?
5) Why can't big girls get love on the thong joint? Come on now! You know Big Girls wanna feel sexy too! They be getting love from the nuccas why not from thong companies?"

 Currently staying at my cousins. Seems my son's Landlord is out for blood and it makes no sense considering he's selling the building. I figured I bounce just to make things less complicated. So I've been apt. hunting and I found one that I fell in love with right away. Crossing fingers that I get this. Made me realize that my need for my own space is definitly coming soon without a doubt. Last time I actually had time to myself for a decent amount of time is when I went to L.A while Ethan was at work.    
 Thanksgiving: boring as hell same shit holiday time. Gossip between family and my need to get the hell out of town. 
 My job can best be summed up the same way I explain it to everyone who asks. It's boring, I hate it but it pays more and I get benefits.  
 Been hanging with a couple of carefully picked friends,actually going out and doing stuff other than drink although primarily that's what we do. But hey I'm not going to say no to 75 cents pitchers and Keg stands are fun!
 My date with a particular person actually was relaxing because I am god awful when it comes to dating. Except when I was with Ryan: he always made me feel comfortable. I kinda miss him but you know you always miss what you can't have. Back to the fun date I had. This person is very much a Soulmate, not in the married and happily ever after way, more in the friends for life, always be there for each other way. Nice and comforting like that favorite pair of shoes. OK he's not a pair of shoes ,I don't feel like being creative dammit. 
 Starting to look forward to the spring although winter hasn't fully arrived yet. 
 Need to get a license, need to get a passport. I think now is the time to head overseas. So now it's a tie between finding family in Genoa Italy, or just enjoying some alone time in Ireland. I still planning on San Diego just don't know how soon. 
 Everytime I plan on going somewhere some stupid fucking boy enters my life and I end up falling for the bullshit. I can honestly say I'm very happy being single right now. At least till I see one of my happy couple friends and get disgusted."

The new job is not as bad as I thought. It's taking me awhile to get used to it and overcome the stupidest challenge I ever had to deal with. Luckily someone reminded me of who I am and my natural tendecies, which then bitch slapped me and made go to work. It helped a lot. 
 been very tired. Over the past 2 weeks I have been everywhere: B-more,Nj,Philly,York. This past weekend was the first weekend I was in town the whole time. 
 The ""date"" turned out to be a bit of a surprise. Fun not at all what I would expect to happen but I saw things coming anyways. 
 Odb died on Sat. Dude that sux, that guy was great funny as hell. I mean other than Dave Chapel he was my favorite crackhead. 
 I didn't do much on my birthday. Pretty much the same thing I do on monday's: go to the Blue Star, get wasted, sing karoke and crash as soon as I get back at the house. The only difference now was that more people joined me. 
I got a gift certificate from work for Barnes and Noble. Thus I ended up getting somethings I really wanted. @ books! The Davinci Code and Blinkiing with Fists. Ok the first one I heard frompeople is really good and it has to deal with catholiscm and paganism. How the two have links,more like how catholics and Christians have stole our ideas and banned the good things in our lives. Before I start really ripping on Priests... Blinking with Fists is a book of poems by BIlly Corgan and if you know me at all, you know I'm teh biggest Smashing Pumpkins Freak in the world, so of course I had to get this book. As I rode back toward the house after getting the books I decided I wanted to be a noble british poet man and real aloud some of the poems in the book. I realized you end up paying more attention to the words had I not said them in my normal voice.  So then Now I'm really insopired to go to an open mike and read poems aloud...that are not mine. Basically I'm reading stufff I like and making fun of people at the same time. hahahahaha I will never stop being mischievous tis in my blood. 
 HOLY SHITE I'M 25!!!!! should I act differently now! I'm older and supposed to mature but I don't realy care either way. Ironic part here:most of my friends that tell me never to get old are all younger than me."

 Geez what a wild last week.
 I left The mortgage place. I got flowers,and cards and ice cream cake oh my! It's was a bit overwhelming.
Then b-more this weekend! I was in this house not even a couple of hours before I found out it was haunted and saw a ghost. Who then showed me his face and lead me to his collection of rare books and records. It was really cool. The house is just a part of an old farm with many houses on the property. It was really nice to hang with some friends from the faire and just to sit there and watch the leaves fall. I needed to relax. 
 I did dress up as California Copperhead from Kill Bill I don't have pics yet but will hopefully soon.
 I started the new job yesterday. It looks easy enough in fact easier than Old Guard, however my only problem is here at this job I end up talking to professionals more and I don't speak their language. I talk to everybody the same way and treat them the same way, to me they are no different than anyone else. So it's wierd that I have to learn to speak their language. I should get it down by tommorow.
 My birthday is next week. I'll be 25 it's weird. I can honestly say that by the time I turn 25, I would of have quit my old job,started a new career, and even dumped my b/f! Yeah you heard that right I dumped Ryan. It's not that he did anything really wrong it's just we both are busy with other things and the whole ""some girl's hotel party"" thing really got to me. It's ridiculous, there's no reason why I should even care that much about it. So I wrote a letter to Ryan and told him he seems really busy and I'm not sure what he wants, but once he figures it out he can call me. Besides I should have a date by next week anyways! Hahaha I'm not telling yet we'll see what happens!"

"event","So finally the faire has ended for this year! There is so mnay things to say about that, I just don't know how to put it together.  The affair with the actor ended a while ago but I found out he was kinda doin this thing to a couple of other girls, then came to funky formal time he went stag and took no one home. haha! Met a lot of cool and kick ass people this year, the fight circle crew, the game pirates, even new people in my area, Queen Mary Rulez!
 I guess I should explain funky formal. It's a huge party for the faire staff at a hotel. You can just funky or formal. You drink ,you dance and yes lot's of hook ups occur. I didn't hook up with anyone seeing I have Ryan but currently he's pissing me off, so instead I danced my ass off all night, including the cha cha slide bitches!
 Saturday night I lost my voice but didn't care and headed off to E-town to see my other hottie drummer. Justin told me that night he's quitting the band and my heart just fell. He's like the coolest guy ever and invited yours truly to Key West, probably come my birthday he won't even be around which sux cuz I was hoping to either get a lapdance or at least a body shot off of him! WHAT?! It's my birthday and he's hot a girl can dream right?!  I actually started crying  when justin told me about this. Like I said he's awesome, I talk to him more than Ryan at this point. No nothing happened between Justin and myself (unless you include the kick in the nuts thing),it's just I'm really gonna miss him, he's so much fun to hang with. We plan tokeep in touch. I dunno he only lives in Jersey.
 Sunday still have no voice and a broken cross. I don't remember if I mentioned that I was a Nun the last couple of weeks at the faire. So uh yeah I went to hug someone and he try to make my boobs vibrate, next thing you know..oops the cross broke and fell from in between us. We both cracked up laughing saying if that's not proof that my faith has broken we don't even know what to say then.
 I still have no voice currently. Really sux right now, I have this week to finish up at the mortgage place. I'm trying to leave on the best of terms and my voice is completly shot. I knew I should of took a damn vacation!
 After leaving the company I'm heading off to B-more for a halloween party then I start the new job and that weekend I'm either heading to Jersey for another party or staying in town and see Justin one more time. My birthday is in 2 weeks then. Nov. 8th people don't you forget it! I still currently have no plans of what I'm doin hoping this year will end the streak of not getting a stripper for this day finally. It's been 7 yrs. I continiously have asked for one and still no show.
 So the Ryan deal... if I think of what he said to me I get so mad. No one has gotten to me like this in a  long time (j-dub and Brad have both gotten to me this bad by what they said to me). So Thursady night I discover that not only is Ryan's a mama's boy but he also was goin to got to ""some girls"" birthday party that was at a hotel. Only it got moved to friday and he couldn't go since he has her daughter on friday's.( Never been happier that my b/f has a daughter at this point.)  Well as you can tell when he mentioned this party I got pissed, well guess what Ryan did ... he just started laughing about it. I told him nothing was wrong but he knew. I have no problem with him getting drunk with his friends at some party. SOME GIRL'S HOTEL PARTY! I have a huge problem with. I know this chick plans on getting laid that night. Now Ryan is saying some girl because he's doesn't know her well or doesn't want me to know who she is. He forgets who I am. I know everyone pratically! Either way Ryan or the chick plan on gettin some ass and I lost it. I kept thinking you better pray I don't know who the chick is or find out where the party is at! I can only see myself breaking into the room and slamming the girls face to a wall. But hey I'm sensible... that would only happen if Ryan was in the room! I'm don't know if getting this worked up about a boy is even worth it. 
  So when Sunday came around I just drank and danced my ass of that night (I think I lost like 10lbs. that night)and for once forgot I had a b/f ,just had a blast with friends that I won't see till like next August."

"event","Not a goddamn thing for once!
There has been a lot that I have left out of entries , mostly cuz I forgot. So here's a brief wrap up of the past 3 months.

School Daze song I made up since the begginning of the faire:

School days school days oh how I hate school days. Snotty noses,big nerds and punk ass kids,little teenage girl with glitter lipsticks. Oh i can't wait for school day cuz that's the day that I get paid!

Doin the school days actually left me with mixed feelings. All I can say is suburban middle school kids need to be beat down! After insulting boys about pimping their dad out and getting a rose for it, I'm pretty sure nothing has changed in high schools across the U.S. Plus I hope my 13yr.old that I taught to pimp is doin good and finally getting those dates he wanted. I don't care if he's young! He was sweet,respectful,and cute as hell! That kid is gonna have so many girls on his jock in 3 yrs. it'll be ridiculous! Oh and the Tech school in reading Area those kids had Ila and myself dying! Nick and Seany are awesome! Seany, if for some odd reason you ever read this thank for the river dance/stripper dance on the top of my counter. Oh and the mysterious gorgeous boy also from schukill I'll see you when your 18. lol (joking) 

Jolene's birthday was a couple of weeks ago and if you know Jolene you know this means herself and I causing havoc somewhere. The place that we targeted that night was The Village. First we went to the Alley Kat and I ended up doin mutiple Jager bombs since multiple people there hate jager ( pussies!) I met Jolene's mom for the first time which was fun and interesting. So Jolene's dad has a crush on me and mine has one on her. For a while now I've been threatening Jule's that I will become her mom and ground her if she don't calm the fuck down sometimes. So I tested the theory and told Jule's mom that I wanted her husband! She gave nme the go ahead so now I have a new daughter and 2 more grandkids! lol! Later at the village Jule's mom accompined us and we laughed as Jule's decide's to go on the stage and do the fucking thriller dance! Who the fuck does the thriller dance! Eventually Jule's mom leaves , leaving us like 2 teenage girl at a school party. It's on! We get trashed, We flirt, We drink hustle, We see our ex's and make fun of them ( Owen + yellow shirt with blue sails= god awful look), We accidently kick our crushes in the nuts! OK it was me! I did it! the super hot drummer that I've crushed on for a year got kicked in the nuts by moi. He started it I walked by him with the intention of just light flirting when he upped and kicked me in the ass! So I went to kick him in the leg and just misjudged is all! Needless to say we both kinda pissed and we ended up hugging each other. Jule's and myself left alone and very happily drunk!
 
 Like I said before Jose and Mel came down to work the faire for a little . Jose from Ohio and Mel from Maryland also worked the faire last year so it was a nice little reunion for us this year. We went to cheers which is a nice country bar and believe me you get stares when 2 spanish people walk into a bar together. while waiting for Mel, Jose and I had enough time to try our pick up/bust/lines on each other,then did a 180 and talked about our significant others. This is the night I became addicted to Shirley Temple's. I dunno why I just did. we did many shot of Capt Morgan's ""Private Stock"" : a smooth and very strong brand of rum. I also decided that if your a pirate at the faire you get lot's of ass so I'm making a shirt for Jose that says"" Pirate's get all the Booty!"". When Mel shows up we finally decided to play music on the jukebox,mind you it's country bar so we had slim picking.  The music of choice that night was Duran Duran,Poison, and CCR which us then lead us into conversations with older folk at the bar which all agreed are swinger sand rather disgusting. The Male decide to tell us really gross sex tricks involving pencils. I can no longer look pencils in the same manner I used to.

 Before that week there was Scottish weekend when Drumma Klanna showed up and in the end I ended up talking hip-hop media and getting retarded drunk with the bagpiper. We both agreed Will Smith should be shot and the Roses really do smell like poo-oh-ooh yeah!

 Patrick Swayze is the Anti-Christ. Thank You Donnie Darko! Someone else share's my feelings for Patrick Swayze! Fuck Ghost! Nobody puts Swayze in the corner!

 Oh and i know this is cheezy but I have a new guilty pleasure: Maroon 5! I like the guys voice I'm sorry but I do and because of that voice I would bone the shit out of him. This decision came to me one day at work and hearing the voice. I announced my decision quite loudly, which lead to other girls professing their love for the voice! See I'm not alone ha ha"

"event","Manticipation-(n) A delicious torment of deliberately to have sex with someone you want NOW!.
 I learned this term whil reading Glamour. Thank You June issue. I know I shouldn't be reading such a cheesy zine but I wanted to do more than just work.
 All this time I've been trying to think of ways to describe my absolute feelings for why I'm crazy about Ryan without repeating ""he's awesome"" for like the 18th time. Do I think he's the one? No. What makes me think is great is that he taught me that we can have our differences talk about them in a calm manor and move on. Agree to disagree pretty much. Also be patient. Being with him for the past couple of months not really getting to see each other,just calling each other makes me really understand that I am suffering from Manticipation.  
 Even when we hang out and he's one of the guys I still don't mind it,still is the only one I wanna take home with me at the end of the night. 
 Wicked sense of humor just like mine. 
 He's not exactly a man's man, not romantic movie bullshit chivalrous,but enough for me. I always wanted a traditional Irish guy maybe because I'm part irish I dunno.
 My type of guy has dark hair,not fat,not skinny,he's tough,stands up for his friends and his beliefs,and be a good kisser,camps,canoes,a fix it man, can entertain a 2yr.old by making silly faces,maybe not a gourmet chef but can make a mean steak! Hardworking but not always wrapped up in his work,funny and can drink. Doesn't have to be all school smart must have some street smarts and still willing to learn.
 I want him in no way that can be described. 3 months together and no sex. If the oppurtunity would come up (and it has) I would still wait. I'm into him for who he is,the sex is worth waiting for. When it does happen... you won't hear from me for a couple of days because I'll still be in a daze. The wait itself is more sexy and exciting to me than actually doing the act. I'm not talking about this bullshit jr.high sex-ed ""I'm worth waiting for"" speech.Making both of us wait learning more about each other and just some light make out sessions is just as fun as full blown lose your mind hours of sex."

Been a little haywire on the home and work front but I'm hoping that comes to an end soon.
 Ryan and I are still together just been a little hard since we both have no cars and insanely busy.
 I up and decided to quit Old Guard , I'm so tired of the place I started just zoning the fuck out and pay no attention to anyone. Don't worry I got another job. I'm now goin to be doin advertising for a website design company which starts the beggining of next month. I'm excited and nervous about this job. It's another job where I have no clue what the hell I'm exactly doin but I always give my best. My dept. is having a going away party for me next week this is so wierd.
 The faire was full of surprise like My roomate up there and a friend of mine decided to go on a date, the vice president of old guard surpised Ila and myself by showing up on sunday, I ate a really good meal at Bube's (filet mignon bitches),met a kick ass chick from b-more. goin to hang with her on halloween, a 13yr.old trying to pimp me out but instead I pimped him out!(anthony) You gotta see the blinging ring he gave me lmao! The last school days were an interesting mix. One day I got nothing but bratty jr.high kids the next day I got a whole High school worshipping me! Of course they were from one of my favorite places! Go New Hope! Oh yeah and I pimped a hot ass 18yr.old (corey) Not to mention my costume on halloween is a Nun! It's the scariest thing I could think of being!
 Last wed. Kari and myself went to the village and damn did kari down like 6 gin and tonics in 2hrs. that was sick even in my eyes! holy shit was it funny but hey at least she got her minds off of a certain someone for a bit. Her haircut is cute as shit.
 Still fighting off a hellish cold. 
 Called my girl Karen since I haven't seen her in forever she's in New Orleans, lucky bitch.
 Unfortunately I'm not goin to Key West now with the new job and all I need all the money I can collect to get a car so I don't have to take a bus the whole damn winter.
 Anyways i need to get some more rest for this weekend is the last weekend at the faire sadly the madness comes to an end. Jesse,Meg,Yaddie,Eric, and Punk Rock Mike all are coming this weekend to the faire then it's off to the Funky Formal where I get in a retarded costume and dance my ass off! Woo Hoo I dunno what I'm goin as there though I'll throw something together. 
 Oh and to top all of this off I saw Brad! That's right B-rad the jerk that I used to be in love and lived with, stole a bunch of my shit and has a hand in severing the ties between Carson,Coasey,and I. He really is a Rent A Cop! LMAO! He got really built though which is what he wanted to do but he still looks like such a douche in his uniform. I saw him looking over at me then I pointed said pretty loud ""That's Brad?!"" and busted laughing. Kudos goes to Ila who was with me at the time and also added by saying "" How ironic that for a Thief he's a Rent A Cop!"" which also led me into bursts of laughter."

"event","So it's a ridiculous time of the day right now, I've been up since 2:30 am I can't sleep unfortunately I have a serious cold and find myself waking up not being able to breathe.  It's been like this for a couple of days. 
 Last week pushed myself to complete both jobs to the best of my abilities only to find myself delusional from exhaustion. 
 I went out to see my cutie friend Justin at the Chameleon and he invited me to Key West,Fl for my vacation. As well as another old hottie friend Mark. Seeing I don't have the money right now to move to San Diego,and since the holidays are coming up it would be a ridiculously expensive move. 
 This weekend was insane people didn't show up which again led me to think how people really do disgust me at times. However I mada insane amount of money for my boss and it was his birthday so I got him a cake and a card. He was pleased to say the least.
 The shock that knocked me off my ass was that the actor who I messed with in the beginning of the faire gave me a rose yesterday! Then to top that off said I made him realize that he's growing as a person and I gave him somewhat of an ago boost! Holy Shit I'm a Fucking Mentor! 
 My boy Jose is back from the Michigan faire, and he brung Mel too! Both of these people I hung out with last season and they are just as much as I am an asshole! We drank on Friday and haven't hung out yet but hopefully we can before the leave for New Orleans.
 I got to talk to Ryan a couple of times last week, I don't what to say about that. Right now I see My crush Justin more than I see my own boyfriend. Justin wants me to go to Florida and hang with him. I have no clue how Ryan is goin to take this. We can't be serious right now cuz of our schedules but we are supposed to be seeing each other and I don't even see him that much. I adore both of the guys because of who they are and I have good times with both. I haven't even had sex with either of them and as lude as this sounds that would actually help me out if I found out what they are like in an intimate situation. (hehe hey I need love too damnit muddafucker). They both have never disrespect me even in their wildest moments, have tons of stuff in common with both. Hell both are even drummers! Man pimping really ain't easy! I'm afraid to talk to Ryan about what's goin on in my head because if I tell him everything he'll either dump me or ...naw he'll probably just dump me then run and hide.
 Also another person from my past is creeping back in. My ol son Carson was working with a band that I'm friends with. Don't get me wrong the new band kicks ass and I love what Carson has done for the band. Carson is a fucking genius, it's just sad that we don't talk anymore because the influence Brad put on him. Maybe we'll talk again one day but I doubt anytime soon. 
Man it's hot as balls in this place. I'm goin to try to get some rest seeing I have to do both jobs all this week with once again no days off! fuck me man!"

"event","So many thing have happened this past week it's been crazy. Yeah last week I did see the Scottish drummers it was like the whole faire was there. Yadie and Jesse came along we had a great fucking time getting drunk and just dancing.
 Still have to wear that stupid brace for a couple more days. 
My friend Jules birthday was last wed. so we decide to go to the village, that was like another reunion. well hmmm I can't tell who had more of a good time jules or me seeing we both did stupid shit that night. Jules ended up on the stage doin the thriller dance and I ended up kicking someone I have seriously been crushing on for the past year in the nuts. The best part is neither of us really remember what all happened we got that wasted.
 The next day I was smoking a cigarette on the window sill when the window decided to fall on my left hand. So to recap real quick my right hand is in a brace and on limited use for another week at that point and a window just fell on my left hand. Needless to say I didn't go to work that day and yes right now my whole left hand is black and blue right now.
 Now to the faire: I was so busy I was happy as hell we broke records in my area including myself. Made over a grand in the past 2 and a half days for my boss, I'm hoping nucca be giving bonuses. As for that actor I made out with a while ago well guess what this weekend he propositioned me and I'm proud to say I turned him down. I'm not goin to ruin the past couple of months being with Ryan just cause some dork wants a booty call!
 Speaking of Ryan, I have got to talk to him a couple of times but I still haven't seen him since he came to see me at the faire. My natural reaction is to break with him. He lives in Holtwood which is like long distance practically, I'm so busy right now that I don't get to spend much time with anyone let alone him. I guess I feel guilt but at the same time it's not like Ryan isn't busy himself: he has his daughter, his job and his band. I should be ecstatic because we are in the same boat and there's no pressure coming from him at all for me to change my schedule. I dunno what to do about bein with Ryan. It sucks this is best relationship I've ever been in but I'm still not happy. I'm such a bitch. 
 I plan on getting another job after the faire to get all the money I need to move since I injured both hands I lost money paying doctor bills, not being in work and paying for my pain killers.  I'm still goin to be to to busy. 
 I need another vacation."

"event","Where do I start? I guess to put it simply the subject of this entry best explains the past week for me, I had to remember alot of my past experiences to deal with current events. 
 Last monday I woke up to excrutiating pain in my right hand only to find out that I do have tendonitis and have to wear a brace for the next two weeks. I have to limit my use of the right hand as well which really sux considering I'm right handed. Plus I really need to loans to close soon considering I had to take a day off because of my hand hurting so much and I paid for my bills with cash so i'm behind in getting other things that I need coming up soon such as my contacts and new works clothes.
 Ryan and I had got to talk for a bit last week as well. We are still doin good and he seems to really care for me. As he puts it concering us (bein a couple) I'm having a good time, don't worry about it, I'm used to just having one night stands. I don't know if this is supposed to make me fell better or what,but right now I'm enjoying myself as well just being with him.
 Work as usual sux. We got a nice little threat from the co-president that if numbers don't go up were goin to be eliminated like survivor! Too bad our numbers have been goin up and he just need to get an enema to remove the stick up his ass. Of course the somment mentioned above left everyone in the office stressed, and in a rather foul mood. I wish they do my job for a day so they can shut the fuck up and see it's not that easy as talking to someone on the phone and in 10 secs try to get them to tell you about their finances.
 I didn't work at the faire on Sat. cuz of my hand not to mention it rained so hard we knew not a lot of people were goin to be around.  My girls came up for that day and I just hung out them . We saw all the good shows,drank,eat,laughed, checked out hot guys. The thing that drove me nuts that day though is when it came to audience partcipation in some of the shows the girls decided to volunteer me! What the hell?! I work there I'm not supposed to be involved in the shows on my days off too! Lmao!  It was cold as hell for a while that day but I think they had a good time.
 The next day I played mentor for some people who had their personal issues and seem to believe I know all the answers. I really don't but for some reason I'm the one to go to. I didn't work at my regular spot which was fine with me I got some time off of that thing. Plus this weekend we had drummers from Scotland performing at various stages round the faire I got to see them and talked a bit to them afterwards. I have a small crush on one of them but that's because he lloks like Ryan, which is really creepy and spooky that I actually just said that. I think I just found my real type: Guys that are tall, have short brown hair and plays drums!
 My friend Meghan got married on Sat. and turns out she's 6 months. pregnant. My friend Kim is pregnant too! 
I guess I miss out alot of my friends happenings since I work at the faire but I'm ok with that I need breaks from them sometimes, it's not like they annoy me or something. I just need my space from people so I can do my own thing and if they decided to show up ( hint hint Kari hint hint) that's cool!
 Hopefully tonite I go to Bube's Brewery to see the drummers one more time. What can I say I attract musicians and I love it!"

"event","this week went so fast and was so wonderful, I wish time went a little slower. This week I had lost my voice, but still manage to get my job done and had a loan close, crossing fingers that the other loan that's supposed to close this week will. I had the top number for the week and was in a general good mood. 
Ryan and I only talked last monday, but I got huge surprise later that weekend from him. Some of my g/f's are coming this weekend to the faire. I'm excited maybe this week I'll take a day off and get to hang with them. I didn't this weekend because Ryan never got back to me, so this of course pissed me off and was left in my head to fester till saturday when I finally said fuck him and decided to go wine tasting after work. As I got there I paid no atttention to the people around me and decided to just do whatever everybody else was drinking when I heard a very familiar ""Hey"",only to look up and see it was my Ryan ! Of course my jaw dropped and I screamed you asshole and ran over to him only to find out his phone died and that's why he couldn't get ahold of me and when he went to find me I was on my break. Nonetheless we spent 2hrs together with his friends and had a good time. Including some good kissing! (hee hee)
So Ryan was forgiving but Jess wasn't. Jess a person who a couple of times for the past couple of months has asked me about getting her a job at the faire had her chance to get some extra money this week working doin breaks on sat. and sun and for the next 2 weeks working doin other games only not to show up leaving me embarassed since I recommended her,but pissing me off and my boss who ended up calling her a fucking hussy! So I decided to say Fuck Her and ignore any incoming calls from her. One thing that always pisses me off more than anything is that people can't fucking back up their word. If you are going to do something fucking do it and don't be a pussy about it. Last time she backed out becasue it's too far of a drive yet I know for a fact there are people who work at the faire that drive from Quarryville,Jersey,Delaware and even Baltimore every weekend just to be a part of this. Man I just thought of this great line from an incubus song that goes like"" Remember when that when you procrstinate you choose lies, thinking goin gray watching you procrastinate!"""

"event","I'm half awake half asleep so if half of this doesn't make sense come back later once I figure out what I was trying to say.
 I can't even really remember much of last week except there were some personal issues I had to deal with so I shut myself away from people for a time. 
 This weekend was crazy I broke it off with the actor. I can't full around while I'm supposed to be with Ryan . It's not fair to him to get hurt in the whole ordeal that I, like a dumbass started up. 
 I told the actor the truth: that I'm really into someone else and have the possibilty to go even further into that relationship, I don't know if it'll work but I don't want to risk the chance of fucking it up and never knowing.  Surprisingly the actor was cool with the idea and was a little upset we can't have ""fun"" anymore.
 Then for the next 2 days I was busting ass dealing with way too many children at one time. Being a fairy sux, when it's kids fantasy weekend! It's like Village of The Damned:they all look alike and start swarming you!  

 However I took most pleasure in particular into 2 events that happend this weekend while working. The first being That I met Ryan Dunn of Jackass,and Viva La Bam fame. He kept staring at my game so I invited him up with a ""Are you gonna just stand there or do you like to watch?"" Of course he came up and I should explain the game I was teaching kids was how to joust. You ride a wooden horse with a fake lance in your hand then grab a ring out of a dragon's mouth. I made a bet with Ryan D's g/f that if he should get it she would have to buy him a beer. Of course he got it but also broke the ring which is attached to a rope. I thought that was of course going to happen considering who the person was. So I can now say Ryan Dunn rode my pony and busted my O ring! hehe
 2nd thing was actually later on the same day. Another cute ass actor at the faire who I guess was supposed to portay Sir Walter Raleigh  (who discovered V.A: my home niggas woo-woo)  decided to also try my game unfortunately I think in real life he's afraid of heights. Anyways he's standing there talking to some kids behind him and as he's bent over I realize I can see his underwear. I then tell the kids in front of him whoever sings I see London I see France I'll give them another prize... only one kid took the challenge.  Needless to say Sir Walter was embarressed while the Kid and I cracked up laughing for quite some time. That kid got a free ride by the way!
 On top of all this I lost my voice twice this weekend I'm trying to get it back now. 
Of course I slept over for the weekend I like I always do and only one night I had to deal with drunken idiots. I just waked around and hung with others.   
 I gotta say this is the coolest job in the world, I get paid to stand around,look cute,and just talk to people. 
 I wonder if I would be considered and asshole because the person that worked with me on my game this weekend was so much dicking around that I told my bosses I don't see the point in keeping him around. He would walk away from his game not telling anyone, not obeying the rules,taking his good ol time and apparently can't multi-task. I dunno I have doubts about him and his sister. They both are big kids not in a good way like more of the annoying I gotta babysit two brats way. Whatever the only thing I guess to do now concerning them is ignore them . They have no direct effect on me and they'll fuck themselves over in the end.
 My older sister Naomi and my friend Tanya b-day is today I have to call them and wish them a good one.
 Talked to my Ryan, who i'm still convinced is the awesomest guy in the world. I might have to give him the title of Man'o the Millenium. Currently John Simon has that title but hey Ryan's my boyfrend and I can give the title to whomever I want since, I made it up. I can't wait to this weekend  when he comes up and wears a kilt! mmmmmmm kilt aggrrrhhrhuhhuhhuh!"

"event","Uh this weekned was cool but a downer due to the insurance issue we had at the games area and the paper fucked up and said it was the whole fair, I hope we sue so I can get paid bitches. 
 Man that places is like temptation island for me because so there's hot guys more than last year and I just love good eye candy. even in ren clothes, regular clothes, shirtless, pantless: Oops did I just say that? Oh well yea the point is too much eye candy turns me into a walking hormone. Hence the comment I made last night at Brendee's.   
 Sara and Bob are back and I'm talking about Scotch Eggs, how good they are and Jess makes a comment about how gross they look and she's right they are disgutsing to look at I'll give her that but what exactly I said was yeah they look like a hairy nut! Thank You Thank You yet another time where I should insert my foot into my mouth!
 So Sara and Bob are back only to Thursady and I got to see them for a whole half hour they seemed tired. 
 It always seems like I'm missing so much of the ol life when i work at the faire but if I didn't so that i'd get bored and probaly disappear somewhere else though.
 Let's ee i got happy drunk and called Ryan on his phone last night and left a happy drunk message , I'm sure I'll hear about it soon enough. I hope he doesn't get annoyed by that. I forewarned him that eventually will do that. It's been three weeks since I've seen him last but with our schedules it's goin to be like that  till the end of Oct. unless I hitchhike to Holtwood sometime. 
 I need a hovercraft bad! 
 Imakinga chicken I'm so excited about making a fucking chicken it's ridiculous!
 Every bone in my body cracks and aches but for what reason I have no idea. Wow I think this is a first where all my friends and myself are all hooked up at the same time and we are all content with our relationships. Wierd!
 I can't think of anything else to say."

  Caught Colleen ( from ol guard) at her desk trying to dance in her chair to some god awful early 90's music.
 Man I dial the phone like it's a typewriter. Oh well we all have our quirks right?! Or is it perks?! 
 Still trying to spruce up this journal here. I hate technology! Kinda wished I had a laptop or at least a tape recorder instead or writting this shit down and typing it up later.
 My realization that I hate overly poppy music came today as I heard that annoying Counting Crows song off the Shrek 2 sdtrk.
  Wonder how cool it would be to just a cabin  in the woods kidnap Ryan, along with some othe people to experiment with me by avoiding all technological forms of communicating. No phones of any type and no computers. Just a Tv, lot's of bug spray, a month's supply of food,condomns and Harps! What?! Been since April since I had sex. Holy Shit! I just realized I could one of those people in ""The Village"". Oh and I'm not talking about those antisocial fuckers either! They're too bitter!
  I could really go for some grapefruit!
  Curious if Ethan came back from L.a to his cousin's wedding. Not because I miss him,so I can rip him an new asshole. I'm vengeful like that!
 Been amusing myself highlighting some phrases in an italian book except I keep referencing to hookers in the translation.
 Finally I'm getting praise at work because I continue to stay and stick it all through all the bullshit. Oh wait it's because I got kicked out early yesterday!
  Omg! Dashboard Confessional is playing on the radio. Chris Carra-bah-bah-ba kinda has this hot, annoying voice.Usually before he get's to the chorus 's in his songs he's almost like a whisper and that's hot but then he does this high talking screaming thing and it's really wierd. Not to mention he's all about wooing the ladies. For the Ladies!!!!!"

"event","with so much drama in the O-G-C it's kinda hard working in this D-E-P-T.
 Last night I got a calls from a couple of friends to come and hang out but with going from the Faire straight to Ol Guard I was too beat to do anything and think clearly. 
 I started to start doin Yoga with Crystal. Yeah I know it makes no sense me doing this shite but after I got my hot outfit this past weekend and realized my gut is soooo unappealing I figured I give it a shot. 
 More shit ensues at the ol main job which is discouraging I found myself now questioning every day why I am there to the point I write reminders on my calendar daily. Oddly none of the stuff goin on directly has no effect on me ,but I still don't care to hear about it either.
I also did possibly the dorkiest, lovey type, shit last night. I called Ryan just to tell him I missed him and he should buy a mo-ped to see me! He just laughed then sang over the phone to me, while tending to his daughter. It's so sickening sweet I can't take it.
 Right now really getting into Lynkin Park which I purposely avoided because they were looped with the nu metal bands which I'm not a big fan of. Then I heard Dj Hahn's stuff on the albums and it's hot!  I was like god damn! That's some good shit! 
 Man I really do swear like a pirate! Oh well Fuck It! haha"

"event","Weekend 2 of the faire was odd to put it mildly. 
 First we found out the person who was supplying us with insurance actually scammed over 17,000 people of their money and ran, didn't properly give us notification of our insurance running out and as of midnight sat.even we can not operate the games till we do. Then it downpoured so the game I usually work on I couldn't do. Met this absolutley beautiful chick who was an exchange student from Romania who turned out to be only 16. My only thought was if they look that good at 16 damn all guy will be in trouble by the time they hit 18. Needless to say my nerdy ass self remembering geography impressed her as we talked about transylvania,lithuania and Latvain gangstas. My god she was hot! I'm not gay or even bi but if I was a guy I'd do her! 
 I decided to spend the night at the faire since Joey was having his friend from Ny here for the weekend ( and as luck will have it is still here till tuesday! he's cool though)I dunno if that was the best decision to stay over at the faire seeing after one of my co-workers and myself made a beer run I headed to the pub to see what's goin on, I got another job at the faire selling clothes which is cool because I now have a hot new outfit I get to keep and received an extra $10 for food and drink.  
Then I did something dumb. I made out with an actor!  I dunno why I did it. Normally I only do this if I'm single or I have a dickhead b/f which isn't the case at this point. 
Ryan is awesome and I really like him.He has never done me wrong and I pull some stupid shit like kissing some guy when Ryan and I have agreed our terms are look but don't touch when it comes to others. I oddly have no guilt about this. Regret kinda, like I should of told the guy last week that I was seeing someone like I told like 3 other guys that hit on me any chance they can get. I dunno this guy is also really nice and spiritual, on a whole new plane, I guess that's what did it for me. Then I kinda wished the next day the guy would be an asshole like most boys are after some heavy petting action with some unknown girl the night before, but guess what? he wasn't!! All I could think was ""Oh Fuuuuck!!!"" 
 The next day I wore the hot costume and got some stares seeing the outfit is pretty saucy! (not I think next w/kend I shall charge a dollar for staring at my chest otherwise I'll let the woman know what their man has been doin! hehehe hustler bitches!) 
 And finally after a long day I find out that Ila one of the girls that works with me now at both jobs decided to go to a bbq in philly after the faire sat.night and isn't coming back into town so now myself and Jules (co worker) need to find ways home. Even though I hooked Ila up with a job and Jules pays her gas money, didn't matter that she calls at the last minute so jules is running around the faire like a chicken with it's head cut off trying to find us a ride! I told my boss this and he said well if games start back up she should know since she volunteered to help us out today and didn't call that she will not have a job here as well. So she just fucked herself up!    Considering if I should just go ahead and Donkey Punch first chance I see her?Hmmmmm?! 
 WOW whatta w/kend and think this is going to continue till Oct.24th! 
 Oh shit and Ryan is coming to Faire to hang with me On Sept.11 and 12th, I'm so screwed.  
Goddamnit!"

"event","well nuthing has gone on too much since the last post. I started the Ren. Faire with no sure person to help so I ended up haivng to load the shit myself a couple of time. That's ok I got strong in my arms so no one better piss me off any time soon. I'll kill them by putting them into a headlock. 
 Sara has not contaced me  :-( wonder what's goin on with that. 
My job once again decided to make some changes , they're getting rid of some people and promoting other. I was rather annoyed with the fact that I'm still not up with a promotion, considering I've been working with my boss in particular for over a 18 months total,. Not even a raise! I don't know if it's worth sticking around there or just go into something temporary get my money and go. 
 I still haven't told ryan about my move. I don't want him to think it's a waste of time to continue seeing each other if I'm leaving in Nov. 
Man I need a vacation. With Joey having his friend coming down today from Ny, I'm going to be crashing at the Faire grounds for the weekend. It'll be like camping only way cooler and more beer!"

"event","People who meet me for the first time say I'm either intimidating or I'm a strong person. It's funny because I don't really think of myself that way at all. I feel like I'm a go-getter. I'm naturally hyper, I can't sit still in one place for too long, I can't let life pass me by and I can't take no for an answer.
 
       3 things that drive me crazy about humanity in general:
1)Procrastination: Don't sit there and wait for shit to happen. Go out there and make it happen.

2) Blame Game: One ""It"" (whatever that may be) happens if you a shall fail  and believe me it happens to all of us, don't point fingers. You slipped somewhere, maybe you took the wrong advice, maybe you didn't know as much as you thought, but please get off your ass, admit you can't dwell in the past and move on.

3) Stubbornness: If you can't accept the fact that you are not always right, I really have no respect for you as a person. I know that sounds harsh, in all honesty being stubborn means a refusal to change , to grow as a whole and if you're not willing to accept that: Your Fucked!
 It really bothers me when someone say don't change, I welcome change! I rather live and learn than just live. Although I'm still pretty much the same person since like 14. Still love my men with long hair, still don't give a fuck what other think of me, I still do whatever I want. It still took a while for me to grow into that person. I like the feeling of being free: to go,feel,fuck, say whatever I want. Now to achieve peace of mind now that's the challenge. *steps off soapbox* Thank YOu Thank YOu( bowing)
 On a completely different note: It's official, I'm seeing someone! I can't say a bad thing about the guy. Even when we drink he never disrespects me and is so much fun!. I end up non-stop laughing and smiling when I'm with him. He has common sense, realistic,practical,caring. We can have a serious conversation,turn around say how cool it would be to have these gigantic animal as pets to train to kill ( he wants the eagle from Lord o the Rings , I want a Panda Bear) and then battle our pets to see who's better! 
He's an awesome daddy too, he the goofy type, Singing along with her ,playing here comes the airplane,bouncing her on his knee. It's what i think every kid wanted: the kick ass dad.I hung out with him Tuesday night, and I met the mom and the grand mom, kid brother, and the daughter. She's cute as hell and it was cool just to see how they interact with each other. We had a nice time together,but as i said a million times before we always do. I'm more laid back when I'm with him , like no faking I'm completely comfortable with him wherever we go, there's no anxiety and if you know me the one thing that causes instant stress is me and the dating scene. The best way too put it is the same way Ryan described us as being a couple: Sometimes there's no need to say anything, it just is."

Sara is coming back can't wait. Man it sux right now kinda. everybody is hooked up except for me and d.b but he has bacon! I have someone i guess i dunno i don't really want to push a relationship right now because I'm gonna busy again round this time because of my 2 jobs.

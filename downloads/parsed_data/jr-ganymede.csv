"event","In the late afternoon, Jeeves is still out playing chess with Redding. The rooms have of course been cleaned to perfection before the manservant's departure, so the handwritten letter on the silver tray on the end-table is all the more noticeable. It reads, in familiar cursive scrawl:

<i>Bertie-

Hello, old thing! I hope you're well? Sorry about not popping in to visit, seeing as we're on the same ship and all, but brother and I have had an awfully hard time stowing away to the Americas as it is, and we were a mite worried about news of our plans getting back to Merry Olde. Do hope you don't take it personally, old chap.

Anyway, reason for the letter. Said dearest brother seems to have gotten into something of a scrape. He was a bit tight at the ship's bar last night when he ran into some bird named Florence who apparently knows of our family. They chatted for a while before mistakes were made, sadly including something that may have been a proposal. I really don't know how these things happen.

Well, the next morning was dashed embarrassing, because sobriety led Claude to see the proverbial light and, frankly, not want to marry this Florence girl at all. She's really quite severe, you see. So when Florence saw him this morn and started talking flower arrangements, he panicked and said it was ME who she'd met! Of all the nerve, am I right?

And of course I couldn't let myself get sucked into holy matrimony, so I informed dearest Florence that I couldn't possibly bear to marry her because, now of clearer mind, I saw that it would be dashed dreadful of me to go marrying Florence when I knew that my dearest cousin Bertram held such a torch for her.

Just thought you should know.

Ta!

"event","The ship is a lovely one - steam billows from its impressively-painted stacks, rising in thick endless puffs into the chilly morning sky. It seems to somehow fuel the surrounding commotion. People of every kind are shoulder to shoulder, both on the dock and the boat. Ticket men stand on boxes to yell out numbers and costs, times and names. Security and trade officers travel around the perimeter in small, careful packs, looking out for anyone appearing just a mite too shifty. Deck hands scramble in seemingly random directions, checking this and that and barking incomprehensible notes to each other. This is too tight, that needs to be refastened... it all gets lost in the cacophony.

And, of course, there are the passengers. While most of them are clutching at each other, trying not to get lost in the push and shove of shoulders and well-polished shoes, a tall gentleman in an understated black bowler seems to be wading through the mob like it was nothing more than a field of grain. Something about his stature convinces people, tacitly, to make way for this man and the younger, not-quite-as-tall gentleman just behind him.

""We are nearly there, sir."""

"event","It is a crisp November morning in London. The trees rustle with the faint wind as the foot traffic in the streets below shuffle along - it is otherwise pleasantly still in the world. The sun is shining through a thin veil of pale grey clouds.

The bedside clock ticks to precisely quarter past ten when Jeeves enters the young master's bedroom with the tea tray. Added to the usual arrangement is a glass of restorative, just beside the cup of immaculately-prepared Earl Grey; Mr. Wooster had something of a late evening last night, Jeeves is given to understand, with some of his associates from the Drones Club.

""Good morning, sir."""

"event","<lj-cut text=""A Brief Biography"">Reginald Jeeves is a recurring fictional character in the short stories and novels of P. G. Wodehouse, being the ""gentleman's personal gentleman"" (valet) of Bertie Wooster. Created in 1915 and named in the title of most of his stories since 1916 and most of his books from 1919 to 1974, he is Wodehouse's most famous character. Jeeves has come to be seen as the quintessential example of his profession.

The essential conceit that drives the Jeeves stories is that the brilliant valet is firmly in control of his rich and foppish young employer's life. Much of the comic effect derives from the fact that the clueless Bertie Wooster, who narrates most of the stories, is for the most part blissfully unaware of how he is being manipulated. When Bertie gets into one of his scrapes, leading to an unwanted social obligation, legal trouble, or marriage engagement, Jeeves invariably comes up with a subtle plan to save the day, often without Bertie's knowledge.

Jeeves is a member of the Junior Ganymede Club, a club for butlers and valets, in whose club book all members must write down all the wrongdoings of their employers. Thus, butlers and valets can be forewarned before taking up employment with the more infamous employers mentioned in the club book. The section labelled 'WOOSTER B' is the largest in the book.

Jeeves is known for his convoluted, yet precise, speech and for quoting from Shakespeare and famous romantic poets. In his free time, he likes to relax with ""improving"" books such as the complete works of Spinoza, or to read ""Dostoyevsky and the great Russians"". He ""glides"" or ""shimmers"" in and out of rooms and may appear or disappear suddenly and without warning. His potable concoctions, both of the alcoholic and the morning after variety, are legendary.

Jeeves has distinct opinions about certain items that Bertie adopts, such as a moustache, monogrammed handkerchiefs, a straw boater, an alpine hat, a scarlet cummerbund, spats in the Eton colours, white dinner jacket, or purple socks. Should Jeeves express his disapproval for an accessory of Bertie's, it is certain that his charge will reluctantly dispose of it in some way or another before the end of the story, or will announce his intention to do so only to find Jeeves has already ""taken the liberty"" of discarding it himself.

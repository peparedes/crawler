Holy sh--&nbsp; I left off at what post?&nbsp; Gotta try to be brief then, somehow, never managed before.&nbsp; Brief with a side of spoilers&hellip;
 
Post 2034.&nbsp; Twentysome pages ago, using the long form.
Okay, so Odin and the boys of the Hunt get some motorcycles and make a run for it, which surely couldn&rsquo;t work except that, for one of them, it does.&nbsp; Artemis, privately in cahoots, privately gives Glen the name of that one.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s in the wind in L.A.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s an argument in the party about whether smashing Dando&rsquo;s skull was something We Angels are supposed to do.
No such argument about whether We Angels should loot Kingman&rsquo;s place though, and there they acquire a Discord Doll belonging to William Squire, highly delusional center of all good gossip in L.A. Glen grabs a few things, including a Castling artifact, and hauls them all out of there before the demons get too close and they all head to Kane&rsquo;s place in Pomona.
Ryuki prepares to meet his new direct superior, a Judge who calls himself Judge Stone.&nbsp; Mitch catches up with the cherub Dennis, and Glen moves all the goodies to his home, or was it his shop?&nbsp; Glen&rsquo;s demon batteries/hostages don&rsquo;t go anywhere, but the same cannot be said for his ethereal black hound.&nbsp; And Sunae and Kane, passengers in Alex&rsquo;s car, pick up a ghost hitchhiker with a message from the ethereals.&nbsp; Dennis will watch out for the wandering Hunter and pay off his debt to Ruby. 
 
Kane tells Corat that he&rsquo;s heard rumors of attacks against major tethers.&nbsp; Sunae thinks that&rsquo;s serious, but Corat figures there&rsquo;s no way Hell would make open attacks.&nbsp; Corat is wrong.
Ryuki gathers everyone at the office for giggles at Ruby&rsquo;s expense and giggles at Judge Stone&rsquo;s expense. He throws in an old kimono with some interesting history&mdash;actually he throws the location of same to Ruby, in a stage production in Santa Cruz.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see if she takes that bait.&nbsp; She also wants taxes on Kingman&rsquo;s stuff and is threatening to make L.A. very inhospitable if she doesn&rsquo;t get them.
(2401)
Corat runs out, leaving you his phone.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a text message: The text reads: &quot;911 direct atk. This is war&quot;. It&#39;s from Dig(nity), the Seneschal of the Dream tether at the movie theater you were at earlier.
 
War just went hot. It&rsquo;s not the Dream theater under attack, it&rsquo;s the War tether at Pohang where a bunch of teenaged kids bought their nation&rsquo;s survival with their lives.&nbsp; Dig tells everyone to stay in San Fran, that Pohang is a slaughter, but Kane&rsquo;s a Malakite and jumps through the rapidly shrinking portal that is the other end of the tether.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s hopelessly outnumbered but manages to save his fellow Malakim from a fate worse than death:&nbsp; captivity.&nbsp; A local cherub/sniper sends Kane back to Heaven at some expense, but at least there are no hostages. At the theater, Judge Stone gives Mitch his true name Briathos and tries to corral the folks there. Presumptuous like a Judge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruby calls to swear it&rsquo;s not her, that it has to be Baal&rsquo;s boys retaliating for all the party&rsquo;s been doing in L.A.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s mostly right, but missing one piece of the puzzle&mdash;what else is eating Baal?&nbsp; She does tell you that the next attack will be on Kumamoto Castle.

"event","Characters in <i>Mile Higher Club/The Pacific War,</i> in approximate order clockwise from upper left

<b>The Wild Hunt</b>--ethereals from a mixed British and Norse mythos.&nbsp; A small contingent helped track <i>Frank/Ah Pukuh</i>, but the bulk of them remained in the Dreams where they were clearly plotting to help their fellows escape their angelic handlers.
<b>Hereward the Wake</b>--ethereal, in life an 11th century British hero
<b>Dando of the Dogs</b>--ethereal, in life a fallen priest.&nbsp; His fight helped <i>von Galen </i>escape.
<b>Bernhard von Galen</b>--nobleman/bishop of Munster, 17th century Germany.&nbsp; Like Hereward he also travels with the Hunt, but alone among them escaped into Los Angeles.&nbsp; Of the party, only <i>Glen</i> knows his name.
<b>Artemis</b>--Greek goddess of the moon and the hunt, not usually associated with the Wild Hunt but sent to accompany them.&nbsp; She told <i>Glen</i> about <i>von Galen</i>.
&nbsp;&nbsp; (not pictured--the <b>Olympians</b>, one of a few pantheons that survives the Ban intact)
the ghost <b>hitchhiker</b>--common urban legend become ethereal.&nbsp; Delivered the ethereals&#39; message to the party, identified the party by <i>Dando&#39;s</i> blood on their hands, er, handkerchief
<b>Baron Samedi,</b> Loa&nbsp;&nbsp; Puckish ethereal trickster well embroiled in celestial affairs.&nbsp; Generally considered a benign pain in the butt, but occasionally chafes outwardly at angelic standards
<b>Papa Legba</b>, the father and leader of the Loa.&nbsp; Wise enough to keep his mouth shut
<b>Frank/Ah Pukuh,</b> a hybrid of a Mayan slaughter god and an imprisoned Balseraph of the War.&nbsp; Based loosely on Uncle Frank from Hellraiser.&nbsp; <i>Kingman</i> set him loose for maximum impact.&nbsp; While tracking him the party crossed paths with<i> Ruby</i>, who was possibly trying to contain the situation, and <i>Ajosshi</i> who was attracted by the noise.&nbsp; He was also actively assisted by <i>Tishbite</i> and his compatriots.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (not pictured, his paramour <b>Julia</b>, the ghost of the lover he killed)
<b>Jerry Kingman</b>, sorcerer dying of cancer and trying to get out of his deal.&nbsp; Kane sent him onward.&nbsp; His lair contained references to New Age beliefs, kitschy <i>Egyptology</i>, and a smattering of <i>Santeria</i>.
his apprentice <b>DeShawn</b>, young man last seen in a tailcoat and top hat
Ryuki&#39;s <b>late uncle Shiro</b>, died violently after brokering a family truce and summoned to use as leverage against <i>Ryuki</i>
Miyako the younger, <b>Mia </b>Watari.&nbsp; Was an occasional customer of J<i>erry Kingman&#39;s.</i>
(not pictured, Ryuki&#39;s father <b>Ryukawa</b>, stepmother <b>Miyako</b>, sister <i>Mia, </i>brother <b>Ken</b>, bodyguard <b>Scott Green</b>, and unnamed family in Nagasaki)
<b>Ryuki Watari</b>, primary NPC.&nbsp; Banking heir, born <i>Creation </i>soldier, and sorcerer.&nbsp; Currently IST <i>Dominic</i>.
<b>&quot;angels&quot;</b>, <i>Kingman </i>believed that <i>Ryuki</i>&#39;s fascination with angels had provided him with angelic contacts he could use to help him.
<b>Briathos</b>, his immediate supervisor and trainer.&nbsp; An Elohite that appears to have a sense of humor, or cluelessness, hard to tell
<b>Dominic</b>, the archangel
<b>Nisroc</b>, angel of Spies, technically answers to <i>Michael </i>but acts as a &#39;red phone&#39; between he and <i>Dominic</i>.&nbsp; Directly aided the party in the house attack with/against <i>Ruby</i> and against <i>Ajosshi</i>.
<b>Michael,</b> archangel of War
<b>Corat,</b> primary NPC, Ofanite.&nbsp; Formerly of <i>Wind </i>as a pilgrimage guide, now of <i>War</i> beginning as a spy recruiter.&nbsp; A transition like this can lead to instability in an angel.
<b>1973 Triad</b>, Tokyo.&nbsp; Convicted <i>Corat</i> in a case involving tampering by <i>Michael</i> of a seraph of the <i>Sword</i>.
<b>unnamed seraph</b> of the <i>Sword</i>.&nbsp; Held the deciding vote in the case and was undecided until approached by <i>Michael</i>
<b>Laurence</b>, his superior
<b>Hamael</b>, Word of Dignity, his servitor.&nbsp; Appears to have some relationship with <b>Soldekai (not pictured),</b> though that may simply be similar temperaments.
<b>Methariel</b>, PC seraph of the <i>Sword</i> (MHC), vetted <i>Ryuki</i> for <i>Laurence</i>.&nbsp; As much as Ryuki enjoyed toying with him, his clarity is definitely missed by the young soldier as he navigates celestial politics
Miyamoto <b>Musashi</b>--Saint of the Sword and military hero of old Japan.&nbsp; Fought against the Christians at Amakusa
<b>Dig</b>nity (not the be confused with Hamael, whose Word is Dignity and on whom she has a crush), Seneschal of the theater tether of Dreams.&nbsp; Apparently well-acquainted with Corat.
<b>Blandine,</b> archangel of Dreams
<b>David</b>, archangel of Stone
<b>Janus</b>, archangel of the Wind
<b>Mahmud</b>, malakite of Faith, friend of Hamael
<b>&quot;Hunter&quot;</b>, pseudonym of a Tsayadim friend of Mahmud&#39;s and possibly Hamael&#39;s
<b>Khalid</b>, archangel of Faith, but Hunter&#39;s superior?
<b>Marc</b>, archangel of Trade
<b>Mitchem</b>, PC, his servitor in the hostile territory of Los Angeles, and has been so for some time.
<b>Zahirah</b>, PC Bright Lilim, formerly of Faith, now up above being remade by Novalis
<b>Novalis</b>, archangel of Flowers.&nbsp; Active in Hawaii, among other places
<b>Gabriel</b>, archangel of Fire.&nbsp; Very unstable, and stays apart from the other archangels.&nbsp; Holds a tether on Kilauea in tandem with <i>Pele</i>.&nbsp; Sponsored <i>Sunae</i>&#39;s family directly while keeping them apart from all others.
<b>Dennis the Firebug</b>, former Djinn in L.A., recently redeemed by <i>Marc</i> with <i>Mitch</i>&#39;s guidance, servitor of <i>Gabriel</i>.&nbsp; Based loosely on Denis Leary
<b>Ashbel</b>, PC servitor of Fire
<b>Grandpa</b>, Saint of Fire, technically Sunae&#39;s great-great-times x grandfather.&nbsp; A very harsh master which tends to rile those around him.&nbsp; <i>Ashbel, Ryuki, and Marty</i> among others have already promised him grievous bodily harm.
<b>Sunae</b>, PC, Soldier of Fire
<b>James &quot;Kahuna&quot; Bouchier</b>, reformed sorcerer.&nbsp; Damned and subsequently brought to redemption by <i>Zahirah</i>, though his redemption is contingent on staying away from sorcery.&nbsp; <i>Ryuki</i>&#39;s teacher since the age of eleven.&nbsp; Priest of <i>Pele</i>, who offered him purpose and shelter from demons.&nbsp; Godfather to <i>Grace</i>.
(not pictured)<b> Lei&#39;alani</b>, mother of <i>Grace</i>,&nbsp; ex-fling and now co-parent with <i>Ryuki</i>.&nbsp; Regards <i>Kahuna</i> as a wise friend.
<b>Zahirah</b>, PC.&nbsp; Bright Lilim, formerly a mere Lilim, switched from Faith to Flowers.&nbsp; It was she who first damned<i> Kahuna</i>, and she who brought him back.&nbsp; She has met <i>Grace</i> in person though at this point Grace&#39;s dad does not yet know it.
<b>Kane</b>, servitor of <i>Eli</i> currently in service to <i>David</i>.
<b>Pele</b>, goddess and former princess of Hawaii.&nbsp; She has a tether at Kilauea and an active cult on the islands, fed in part by superstitious tourists

<b>Ruby</b>, Lilim, and functionally the demon queen of Los Angeles since no earlier than 2000.&nbsp; She &#39;rules&#39; the renegade town through a network of favors owed, though she&#39;s had to compete with <i>Ryuki</i> for business.&nbsp; The rivalry between the two of them seems to work well for running the town, at least so far.
<b>Ajosshi</b>, Knight of the Game, sent to L.A. to quiet things down and perhaps knock the Lilim queen down to size.&nbsp; While his mission failed, it may have let Hell see that angels were working with her, or at least not actively against her, to achieve mutual ends.
<b>Asmodeus</b>, the Game.&nbsp; The slippery status of Los Angeles might be a problem for him, or it might be a cudgel to beat other demons--and angels--with.
<b>Baal</b>, demon price of The War.&nbsp; He can&#39;t be happy that angels are moving openly in Los Angeles, when less than 20 years ago they were humiliated and slaughtered.&nbsp; The attack on Pohang could be a counterattack in his mind.&nbsp; He is certainly encouraging Michael to think in that direction, wanting to heat up The War and get it done with.
<b>William Squire</b>, renegade Balseraph.&nbsp; In his delusions he believed he was the puppetmaster of the entire War, but in practice he was an excellent spy, able to track <i>Baal</i> and<i> Michael&#39;</i>s secret meetings through a combination of skill and luck.&nbsp; Numerous discords from being reminded that he was not in fact the puppetmaster were put into a discord doll.&nbsp; That doll was being held for safekeeping by <i>Jerry Kingman</i> who may or may not have understood its significance.
<b>Lilith</b>, demon princess of Freedom.&nbsp; Superior to <i>Ruby</i> (or not?) and former superior to <i>Zahirah</i>.

<b>Eli</b>, archangel of Creation.&nbsp; Blessed <i>Kumiko</i> while she was in the womb, and so is technically <i>Ryuki</i>&#39;s superior.&nbsp; Is also <i>Kane</i>&#39;s superior.&nbsp; <i>Kumiko</i> was one of many so blessed, and while at the time he was acting more or less randomly, before his walkabout he would have been able to create the conditions where this would happen on purpose.
<b>Pepito</b>, impudite of Dark Humor. A &quot;sick puppy&quot; i.e. a demon too stupid to serve <i>Kobal</i> effectively so he was placed in the role of a child in order to corrupt his caretakers.&nbsp; This position allowed him to spin <i>Corat </i>towards a fall, leading to at least one discord.&nbsp; Went to school with <i>Danae</i> the telepath (listed under &quot;other spies&quot;).
<b>Tishbite, Tyura, and Golmorath</b>, canon demons from L. Rel.&nbsp; Tishbite imprisoned the other two inside televisions as part of a failed project meant to impress his superior Vapula.&nbsp; Tishbite connected with Frank, using his technical skills to help <i>Frank</i> communicate and possibly enlist his aid to stay out of the private room in Hell <i>Vapula</i> has no doubt prepared for him.&nbsp; Tyura and Golmorath help Tishbite stay out not because they like him in any way but because their mere existence will make them a target for Hell&#39;s wrath.
<b>Vapula</b>, demon prince of Technology
Hosogawa Tadotoshi, late daimyo of Kumamoto Castle and friend and sponsor to Musashi in life.&nbsp; Now revered as a kami.
<b>The kami,</b> gods of Japan including deceased relatives and other people who were noteworthy in life.&nbsp; In order to survive they made a deal with <i>Nybbas</i> in the post-war era to spread their image worldwide.&nbsp; Despite the demon&#39;s fine print and the disdain of fellow ethereals, the kami survived and fulfilled the contract, ending it recently to <i>Nybbas</i>&#39; frustration.
<b>Nybbas</b>, demon prince of The Media.&nbsp; Took a loss in Japan but sees opportunity in Los Angeles.
<b>Beleth</b>, demon princess of Nightmares.
<b>Baku-ya</b> and two accomplices, nightmare demons behind the attempted attack against Kumamoto Castle.
<b>the Dylan twins</b>, Bill and Ed, detained in the Loa compound where it was insinuated that they were spying there.
<b>Marty, Kevin, and other spies</b>, recruited by Corat for Nisroc, their existence is supposed to be a secret."

"event","I&#39;ve been tossing this around in my brain a bit, made easier by my own temporary infirmities.&nbsp; Inspired in part by Diaz&#39; death scene in The Grey and a couple other films like it, and Into Thin Air.&nbsp; I happen to have a friend named Nate who I pictured when I wrote this, although he lives in a comfortably warm climate and I sincerely hope he continues to do so for a very long time.

No one could remember the incident, unless Nate&rsquo;s memories had somehow survived his death, and he&rsquo;d somehow conveyed those memories to someone who could make the connection.&nbsp; Too many somehows.&nbsp; Corat himself had lost the memory many years later to the hand of a celestial surgeon-executioner who lacked Laurence&rsquo;s merciful and technical precision&hellip;and since it had only been Nate and Corat, there was no one else to remember.&nbsp; But it happened all the same, and perhaps the wind knows&hellip;
It was early enough in the 20<sup>th</sup> century that men believed all things were possible and the Himalayas&nbsp; conspired to prove them wrong.&nbsp; It was also a time that complicated role building like never before.&nbsp; Corat&rsquo;s superior (if you could call it that&mdash;hierarchies are very loose in Janus&rsquo; camp) went with the classics and inserted Corat&rsquo;s role into the society of the sherpas.&nbsp; It was a natural fit to his personality and a chance to increase the talents that highlighted his could-be Word.
A group went up the mountain but got separated by the weather and Nate&rsquo;s insistence on pushing through it.&nbsp; Corat&mdash;obviously not his name under the circumstances&mdash;loved the speed but advised more caution.&nbsp; The two of them got well ahead of the group which pleased his employer but it left them dangerously exposed with no established camp above them.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d counseled Nate to go back to camp but by the time he listened it was too late.&nbsp; They had to shelter under an outcropping, eat what they&rsquo;d packed and stay warm as best they could.&nbsp; If the storm passed quickly&hellip;it did not.
Corat talked with Nate about life and hubris, about what was important and what could be left behind, about how one day there&rsquo;d be a camp not far from there and no one else would be stuck in this situation.&nbsp; Nate spoke of hope that the storm would die, that their snow half-cave would be enough shelter, that they would be found in time.&nbsp; He tried to light a fire from the tiny bit of brush they could find but the flame wouldn&rsquo;t hold.&nbsp; When Nate finally realized the gravity of the situation he apologized for taking Corat away from his family with his own foolish pride.&nbsp; It is then that the conversation got honest.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be going to see my family.&nbsp; In Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nate wondered silently whether his Sherpa was a Christian, but didn&rsquo;t say anything.&nbsp; Oxygen was precious now, and words had to be chosen carefully.&nbsp; Nate pulled his coat closer around him and noticed his fingers were not moving anymore.&nbsp; Corat noticed too.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an angel.&rdquo;
Nate laughed and thought it through.&nbsp; &ldquo;You grow wings. &nbsp;You fly out.&nbsp; You fall like a stone.&nbsp; Air&rsquo;s too thin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had he believed it was a simple rescue fantasy, or did he understand?&nbsp; &ldquo;Truth?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Truth.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My wife told me not to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nate was confessing.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a priest.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nate nodded, put a stiff hand up to tell him to stop.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you make it to camp?&rdquo;
Corat shook his head sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cold, okay.&nbsp; Fatigue, okay.&nbsp; Air, not okay. &lsquo;&hellip;the breath of the Almighty gives me life&rsquo;.&rdquo;
Nate understood.&nbsp; &ldquo;Job 33.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Maybe, if I could see my feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; He started to get up. Nate pulled at him.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Call God.&nbsp; Rise up.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I could.&nbsp; Just rise up, be gone.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t. &nbsp;I stay.&rdquo;&nbsp; That his role was due to retire soon barely crossed his mind. &nbsp;He had to stay and offer comfort on Nate&rsquo;s last journey.
They sat and talked awhile, carefully chosen words, until Nate passed into death-cold&rsquo;s sleep.&nbsp; Corat listened even when Nate&rsquo;s words stopped making sense.&nbsp; It was horrible that the storm was calming because it was too late for his pilgrim&hellip;his friend.&nbsp; He waited until he was certain Nate was gone and then got up, facing the winds and the mountain, climbing up.
He could have ascended, simply.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t just to protect the role, since neither body would be found for decades, if ever.&nbsp; He intended to understand death, to feel life slipping away and to know intimately the struggle of his late friend, and of all who go through it, to the very end.&nbsp; Trauma would take much of that memory, but it could not take the experience of it, the moments from now until then.
Corat walked until he no longer could, then lay down where he might enjoy the beauty of killing nature.&nbsp; It was not to be; the storm was not finished with the mountain yet.&nbsp; He felt the cold, the limbs dying, the mind losing its grip.
When he arrived in the Canopy there was not one word of derision, no scolding for dying alone on a mountain.&nbsp; They understood that something profound had taken place, even if no one would ever know the details.

"event","Since it is wildly impractical to do Snark at work...

characters

<b>Snark</b>--narration voice of the GM. Usually gives attitude with her summaries, occasionally gives spoilers or other underlying information.

<b>Corat</b>--Now a Wheel of War, he&#39;s still adjusting to the transition. A longtime guide, he chafes when asked to lead, preferring to offer advice over giving orders--yet a Malakite needs orders.
Adding to his discomfort is the appeal of his conviction over the Yasukuni pilgrimage. Sure it would be nice to clean Dominic&#39;s proverbial house, but why now? Why now that his memories of the events are all but gone? Why exonerate a Warrior when an odd mix of characters is setting fire to a cold war?

<b>Ryuki Watari</b>--Now a Soldier of Judgement, though a very newly minted one. This decision has received a slightly warmer reception than he expected, and he&#39;s keeping mum about some of his reasons for making it. Some of them, though, were laid bare by Dominique. He thinks that with Nisroc&#39;s intervention and his own wiles he can keep the secrets dear to him from the old inquisitor-seraph, but Corat at least thinks he&#39;s being incredibly naive, and this has put a tiny wedge in their friendship.
Ryuki, in his infinite humility, intends to save the world from the celestial war that has made his life so &#39;interesting&#39;.

<u>The Infernals</u>

<b>Ruby</b>&mdash;unaffiliated Lilim, de facto demon queen of Los Angeles. She has something of a pact with the angels of the party. She definitely has a rivalry with Ryuki, and he functions as an alternative for demons who want to make a deal but don&#39;t want to pay her prices.
She knows basically everything there is to know about the city, and will sell it to you at a price...

<b>William Squire</b>&mdash;Balseraph. Somehow the late Gerald Kingman ended up with his Discord doll, showing that Squire is very much on the edge. Squire will tell you that he is the puppetmaster of demonkind, certainly an all-knowing kind of guy, but either he&#39;s becoming a good guy or that&#39;s just not true.

<b>Ajosshi</b>&mdash;the latest in a long line of Gamesters to walk into L.A. expecting to make it their town, only to get shown the door without their vessels. Big, powerful and smart, but still not enough.
His favorite soldier, unnamed. Also killed in that battle.

<b>Tishbite </b>and his three companions. Balseraph Baron of Technology, with <b>Golmorath</b>, Impudite Knight of Nightmares; <b>Tyura,</b> Impudite Baron of Fire; and <b>Sandernog</b>, Impudite Baron of the Media. They&#39;re at cross-purposes, but they agree on one thing: don&#39;t get caught. (L. Reliquarum, canon characters)

Princes involved so far: <b>Asmodeus,</b> who&#39;s bothered by the appearance that they&#39;ve lost L.A. Sending in guys like Ajosshi is a win-win for him though&mdash;either they get humiliated or they win the town. Asmodeus sends his most egotistical guys into this assignment.
<b>Baal</b>, who&#39;s bothered by the possibility that they&#39;ve lost L.A. and is eager for a counterattack.
<b>Kobal </b>should be concerned about the amount of firepower brought to bear on a mere sick puppy, but he&#39;s still laughing at how an idiot Impudite could cost Heaven so many resources.

<u>The Celestials</u>

<b>Corat</b>, who answers to<b> Ihi&#39;Velga</b>, who answers to<b> Nisroc,</b> who answers to Michael and occasionally to<b> Dominic</b>.

<b>Nisroc</b>, word of Spies&mdash;still the only real line of communication between Michael and Dominic, outside of some very formal words at the Seraphim Council.

<b>Judge Stone/Briathos</b>, Elohite.&mdash;Ryuki&#39;s Dominican recruiter and at this point his direct superior.

<b>Hamael,</b> word of Dignity, well-regarded Malakite of the Sword. Methariel&#39;s direct superior.
<b>Mahmud,</b> Malakite of Faith, his Tsayadim friend. He probably has more than one.

<b>Derek</b>, Kyriotate seneschal of the red-eye tether of Wind, 767 from Honolulu to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Denver and back.
<b>Dignity</b>, Cherub seneschal of the Hilltop Theater tether of Dreams in San Francisco.
<b>Elias</b>, seneschal of the soul food restaurant tether of Creation in Los Angeles.
? , seneschal of the ice cream truck tether of Trade in Los Angeles.

<b>Jasmine</b>, estranged friend of Corat&#39;s, Mercurian of Flowers and a stripper by trade. L.A. resident.

Archangesl interested so far:&nbsp; <b>Michael, Dominic, Novalis, Eli.</b>

<u>The Ethereals</u>

<b>The Loa</b>, notably the <b>Baron Samedi</b> and their leader <b>Papa Legba</b>. They are allied with Heaven which has caused friction with the other ethereals, though since their concept is of gods to the downtrodden they&#39;re not completely shunned. If anything they&#39;re rather popular these days, throwing wonderful parties.

The <b>Lord of Misrule</b>, capable of leading a mob at a party.

<b>The Aesir</b> and <b>the Olympians</b> receive Essence from their place in the Western canon and in pop culture. Certainly they have to fight neophyte pretenders for that Essence, but it&#39;s coming in enough to ensure their survival.

The <b>Wild Hunt</b> contains members of the Aesir, spirits of dead heroes and legends of Anglo-Saxon folklore, proving that ethereals can band together. This surprises most ethereals, who tend to be highly tribal.
Among them Christoph <b>Bernhard von Galen</b>. In life a 17th century prince and bishop who knew his way around a battlefield and enjoyed hunting.
<b>Hereward the Wake</b>, among other epithets. An 11th century English hero known for his chivalry and the loyalty he inspired in others.

The<b> Japanese pantheon</b> has just thrown off their Media masters, but their allegiances are not yet known.

<b>Ah Pukuh</b>, the ethereal half of &ldquo;Frank&rdquo;. Mayan god of death and slaughter, seduced the ghost who goes by Julia. He was defeated and exiled, and probably near-dead.

<b>Black Shuck</b>, one-eyed hound of the English highways, known for protecting lone women and meting out vigilante justice. And being a dog.

Certain denizens of the spirit jars

<u>Ghosts and others</u>

<b>Julia</b>&mdash;the adoring and scheming lover of &ldquo;Frank&rdquo;.

Dream soldiers <b>the Dylan brothers</b>.

Ryuki&#39;s late uncle <b>Shiro Watari</b>.

The <b>girl-guide</b> he spoke of in the afterlife, a ghostlike recording put there by angels of Destiny to tell the newly-dead where they are and where they should go.

<b>Ryuki&#39;s mother and daughter</b>, both affected by Eli&#39;s gift.

His FWB <b>Bobbi.</b>

Family friends and business partners the<b> Ivanovs</b>. Good guys capable of shady deals.

Various medical personnel on either side of the war, in Los Angeles.

The late <b>Gerald Kingman</b> and <b>Gavin Russo</b>, both killed with swords.&nbsp; Ryuki&#39;s a suspect, but so are a number of other people.&nbsp; Guys into magic tend to also be into swords, though they&#39;re usually not functional ones."

"event","<i>This was a bad time for portentous dreams</i>, he thought.&nbsp; Like he had time.&nbsp; After spending basically the whole night up with the Dylans, Ryuki hopped on a two hour flight back to the bay, planning a nap to get him through work that day.&nbsp; The nap had to be interrupted by a dream, and possibly someone else&#39;s to boot.&nbsp; Bother.

In the dream he wasn&#39;t himself--he was a divorced, middle-aged woman.&nbsp; He didn&#39;t know her name or much about her but that was the nature of dreams.&nbsp; Sometimes you were a different age or race or even species, though it was rare of him to switch genders.&nbsp; She-himself had an ex-husband who had reappeared in her life and intended to mooch off her a bit, living in her home and claiming to go to work every day when she had strong suspicions he was doing no such thing.&nbsp; So far not too far a stretch from Ryuki&#39;s own expectations:&nbsp; moochers kind of came with privilege.&nbsp; In this dream the ex had spread a rumor that her brother had gone violently mad, probably a a ruse to isolate an older brother from protecting his younger sister as a brother does, and perhaps to make friends uncomfortable approaching any serious subject with her.&nbsp; He saw right through it.&nbsp; This curiously short fellow led her and some friends, for some reason, down a steep set of stairs into a subway station.&nbsp; Five floors down, he didn&#39;t know why five, but when they got there the place was awe-inspiring.&nbsp; The walls were coal black so you could not really see the depth of them, and in front of them were edifices made of limestone or marble or ice, a blindingly white substance without shine.&nbsp; The effect suggested blacklight without actually bearing that purple hue, and it was awesome.&nbsp; The dreamer&#39;s short ex stopped and gaped, along with her and the friends with them.&nbsp; Then she/Ryuki snapped out of awe and came to a lucid thought--if the ex had taken this subway to work every day, he would cease to be awestruck by its beauty.&nbsp; He was awestruck, however, and revealed to be a liar, a fraud, a moocher.

He woke as the plane landed, before sending the dream-guy away.&nbsp; Annoyed and wondering whether he&#39;d truly jumped in to someone else&#39;s dream, he picked up a bottle of water and energy drink to get him through the day.&nbsp; Morning workout was light and the shower chilly, and he&#39;d get through it alright.

He got into the office on time, no clear signs of the night he&#39;d had.&nbsp; &quot;You have another 4:30 appointment,&quot; Nicole told him, indicating the type of appointment by failing to say more.

&quot;IHS?&quot;&nbsp; Ryuki used the cover name he&#39;d started for angelic business back at his graduation party.

&quot;He appears to be.&nbsp; &#39;Harry Stone&#39;, said he was a judge but didn&#39;t correct me when I called him &#39;Your Honor&#39; at the office.&nbsp; Either he&#39;s really fond of the title or he&#39;s not a justice.&quot;

&quot;And just a name?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all he&#39;d give me.&quot;

&quot;And he has an appointment?&nbsp; Nicole, you&#39;re slipping.&quot;&nbsp; It was a tease but one with truth in it.

&quot;He dropped a name or two.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s better.&nbsp; I&#39;ll have to give you more on what to expect from these people.&quot;

And with that he went through his ordinary day, wondering who or what precisely &#39;Harry Stone&#39; was.&nbsp; He called Gerhard&#39;s old number again, despite knowing that the angel who was Gerhard now went by another role, and got the answer he expected, which was none at all.

<i>Harry Stone,</i> he thought, <i>I know that name from somewhere</i>.&nbsp; He asked the magic box aka his internet browser and it made sense:&nbsp; the name was a character from &quot;Night Court&quot;, a show he used to watch staying up late babysitting his siblings. <i> Seraph?</i> he wondered.&nbsp; <i>Or just an angel with a shallow role?

--------------------------------------a little later----------------------</i>

A few appointments later he came up with a plan.&nbsp; Excusing himself when a client cancelled, Ryuki acted on the advice from the dream.&nbsp; <i>The liar is revealed when he is awestruck by something he should have seen everyday</i>, he thought.&nbsp; <i>So what beautiful thing does a human being see every day that an angel would find entrancing? </i> It was a harder question than it first appeared, since he himself would take those things for granted.&nbsp; He hoofed it to the local pet shop and looked around.&nbsp; No cats or dogs, not at the office.&nbsp; Something visual...&nbsp; He stopped to look at the golden snails but found himself enchanted by their dreamy dancelike motion, and decided they were too pretty for his purposes (and that sleep deprivation was bad for him).&nbsp; Near them, however, was a rack of betta fish.&nbsp; Not as low maintenance as the snail would be, sure, but still not a terrible burden between him and his brother.&nbsp; He moved four similar-looking fish together and chose one of two that he really couldn&#39;t tell apart, a common enough looking fellow for a fish.

He got it back to his office and plunked it down on his desk in its classy but plain little bowl.&nbsp; He shifted it over to one side so his guest&#39;s gaze would not naturally fall on it, and then teased the little creature into puffing up.&nbsp; Satisfied that he had an ordinary fish to lure a very special bird with, he napped in his chair until Nicole informed him that his next appointment was on the way.&nbsp; He plodded through it, a patient client who trusted him well enough to forgive a lapse.&nbsp; Afterwards he called Nicole again.

&quot;Hey.&quot;&nbsp; He was tired, but he was also feeling puckish.&nbsp; &quot;Can you tell &#39;Harry Stone&#39; to postpone, say until Friday?&nbsp; See if you can get any more information out of him.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try, boss.&quot; 

&quot;And if the front desk can spare you a sec, I&#39;d like to brief you on what to expect.&nbsp; Confidentially.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;&nbsp; Nicole was a professional who believed, like most people who knew him, that Ryuki suffered from persistent but largely harmless delusions.&nbsp; This belief was barely touched by the existence of &quot;IHS&quot; (in hoc signus, if her research was correct) but as always it was a premise on which he and thus she would base action, with little regard for objective reality except to warn his father when the rabbit hole got too deep.&nbsp; She took notes on titles and quirks as if IHS were just another company and not the company of angels he told her truthfully that they were.&nbsp; He knew she was humoring him but saw no reason to lie.&nbsp; Best she hear the truth and not believe it than hear a plausible lie that contained a dangerous omission of fact.

Exhausted by his own life, Ryuki went home early that day."

"event","<p>I&#39;m slightly inebriated and otherwise not all there, but aware enough to know that the Angelfire page is low on capacity.&nbsp; So these are notes on the characters who come to mind:<br /><br />Ruby<br />independent Lilim, formerly of Lust<br />theme song:&nbsp; Poe: Angry Johnny<br />While L.A. is in fact a renegade town since 2000, this lady told herself that power equalled freedom and collected as much of it as she could.&nbsp; Her own vessel looks a bit like the late Brittany Murphy, but in dangerous situations she&#39;ll call in a favor and use someone else&#39;s, preferably someone prettier or slinkier&#39;s<br />While she has an extensive web of geasa-based power (and some mere alliances, a couple arguable friendships and a couple arguable slaves), she still has to be mindful of Hell itself.&nbsp;<br />song:&nbsp; Nancy Sinatra:&nbsp; These Boots Are Made for Walking<br />Because Ruby can&#39;t take on a demon prince herself.&nbsp; Fortunately the rest of the folks in L.A. hate the Game as much as she does, and Gamesters are generally sent home the hard way.&nbsp; Ajeosshi was more powerful than most, but otherwise the only thing unusual about his fate was that angels were involved.<br />Ryuki is a business competitor and she treats him as such, as long as you consider geasing someone into a very compromising position to be mere business--as she does.&nbsp; She may have the Enslavement Song--she&#39;s certainly convinced him that she has.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ajeosshi<br />(the name is from Ajeossi, which is a Korean word meaning uncle or protector, possibly Big Brother)<br />Like most Gamesters he was ambitious, and like most he got smashed to roadkill when he tried to &#39;enforce&#39; in L.A.&nbsp; When he insinuated that he had a powerful backer, was he bluffing?<br />Although he was defeated, his vessel-death and Trauma were actually self-inflicted.&nbsp; By hiding the Humanity (Song?) he prompted the angels to overdose him.&nbsp; The Game takes traitors poorly, and giving the angels a chance to question him...tsk tsk.<br /><br />He had a Soldier of Hell with him, a long-serving young fellow.&nbsp; He was also able to hijack at least some of Ruby&#39;s minions, though by Song or force or fear...well, certainly could have been all three.<br /></p>"

"event","<i>Am I doing the right thing?</i>&nbsp; he thought, but it wasn&#39;t really a question.&nbsp; Of course I&#39;m doing the right thing.&nbsp; Who else is going to be there, on such short notice?&nbsp; Marty, maybe, but he&#39;s probably working tonight.&nbsp; Pylus, their angel from Dreams?&nbsp; Maybe, but how could he possibly understand what they were going through?&nbsp; Even with centuries of experience you can&#39;t know what it is to be a parent with a sick kid, can&#39;t know--well, maybe can&#39;t know--what it is to have a brother who might not make it back.&nbsp; Maybe they did get the latter, it&#39;s true.&nbsp; But there was so much he understood that someone outside their Dirty Dozenish could not, and he had to be there, for Karen if no one else.&nbsp; He had to be an equal, not a boss, but an experienced equal who knew what to tell a doctor and how to deal with being a Cassandra.&nbsp;<br /><br />When he knocked on the Dylan family door he knew at that moment that he&#39;d done the right thing.&nbsp; They were all awake and crushed him in a hug the minute he walked in the door.&nbsp;<i> I&#39;m doing the right thing</i>, he thought, the only question is <i>Can I convince the angel of that?</i>&nbsp; And he didn&#39;t know Pylus, and Pylus didn&#39;t know him, and that was going to be an uphill battle made more difficult by his own lack of Superior.<br /><br />That was only partly by accident.&nbsp; He was sincere about Judgement, liked the simplicity and authority of that archangel, liked that it represented the polar opposite of what Corat&#39;s stood for while still standing on the same side.&nbsp; Part of that was hedging his bets--if things did go sideways among angels he wanted to be in between as a peacemaker, not on one side killing and dying.&nbsp; Much of that was his inherent curiosity--he&#39;d pick up bits from both opposites and have to puzzle them together, and puzzles always thrilled him.&nbsp; But she said no, and he wasn&#39;t going to disgrace either of them by an appeal.&nbsp; He would have to find another.<br /><br />Marty and Kevin, both wise men and close friends, nudged him towards Michael.&nbsp; He held a terrific amount of informal authority by way of history, as opposed to Laurence&#39;s formal authority.&nbsp; He&#39;d grok the rebelliousness, the headstrong tendency to do things one&#39;s own way, to occasionally buck orders.&nbsp; And he loved to fight--despite getting older and more responsible and despite facial surgery, Ryuki still loved the barfight.&nbsp; As long as the other guy understood it for the bonding and recreation that it was, and most guys did, it was purely a good time, and Michael&#39;s angels would definitely approve.&nbsp; It looked like the perfect match, except...<br /><br />The War, the angel wars, was in Ryuki&#39;s mind exactly what was wrong with the whole situation.&nbsp; It drove them to compromises, to sacrifice people and fellow angels for mere objectives, to fight and make noise.&nbsp; And had there been no war maybe, just maybe Eli would not have hidden, and his family wouild not carry its mixed blessing, he might have grown up with both parents together, might not have had to learn to lie so much so young.&nbsp; War was his one big beef, and he&#39;d have a hard time looking Michael in eye (well, discounting that whole head explodey feeling) and not telling him that his Word was inherently wrong...even if you included ordinary human wars, which were a whole other category.<br /><br />He sat down at the table, accepted their tea, and talked with the Dylans about what was going on."

Three more demons walk up and one of them gives Ryuki a headache, identifying that demon as a Big Guy. Corat rubs his figurative hands together at the thought of taking out Ruby and her minions. Ryuki reminds them that killing her could destabilize L.A. Is that what he means, or does he care? And if he cares, is it for the girl she&#39;s possessing or the demon herself? Oh sure, he says it&#39;s because he doesn&#39;t need another full-time job i.e. running L.A. and keeping Baal out without her around.</font></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><span style=""font-size:medium;""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif"">Mitch tries reasoning with<strike> him</strike>, her!&nbsp; her!&nbsp; My students&#39; bad habits are rubbing off on me!&nbsp; help! but even a Tradesman struggles against a determined Lilim.

Gilbert&#39;s no fool, and the old soldier leads Mitchim into the house to consult with the Kyrio Seneschal.&nbsp; She likes having a human to talk through and tells Mitch to get Gilbert the hell out of there, that tethers are worth less than lives essentially.&nbsp; Or that people are easier to get out of suburbia than trucks I suppose.<br /><br />The howls of dogs tell you that the wild slaughter-god is on the loose, and the chatter from the fake cops tells you that they&#39;re working for him as much as Hell.&nbsp; Which means in a backhanded way the charnel house is working with Ruby, demon anarchist ruler of L.A.<br /><br />Meanwhile back at the Hilltop an Italian-speaking ghost keeps asking to help, so Glen lets her out of her bottle.&nbsp; Oh she&#39;s pretty but oh so skinny, and oh such a liar.&nbsp; After a bit of dialogue they realize she&#39;s a starving ghost and that she calls the slaughter-god Frank, and that he&#39;s her lover.&nbsp; She kinda&nbsp; mentions that he&#39;s also her killer--such an ugly turn in their relationship.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ryuki shows up.&nbsp; He can&#39;t miss a good time like this.<br /><br />And a little summary on post #804, which would have saved me a bit of time if I&#39;d gone there.<br /><br />Julia tells Glen about the Black Shuck in the other jar before he realizes she&#39;s trouble and puts her back.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first volley in the fight in suburbia goes to the Kyrio, who sics? siccs?&nbsp; a nest of wasps on the demons who though they&#39;d go around back.&nbsp; It&#39;s only the first shot.&nbsp; This fight is going to get ugly, especially once the Wheel of War and the Fighting Creationer with the flaming blade get there.<br /><br />Dignity and Nisroc sing a wormhole Song together so deus ex memoratora we can get everybody to suburban L.A. for the big conflagration.&nbsp; Which I&#39;ll have to write about later, since I&#39;m paying by the hour...<br /><br />(left off approx. post #848)"

While he didn&#39;t have true precognition, not under most circumstances anyway, he could sniff and surmise and decide that this guest could touch the profound truths of the Symphony. He gave the newcomer his full attention, discarding the Distracted Old Man as well as he could. &ldquo;Come in, come in.&rdquo;...</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif"">&nbsp;</font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif"">...When the conversation turned deeper he shifted forms to that of a matronly black woman. He was quoting The Matrix, hoping his guest would catch the reference. Not the haughty old Architect but the comforting and wise and slightly mad Oracle. &ldquo;There&#39;s this book,&rdquo; she said, poking through some more ordinary archives for just the volume. &ldquo;Chanced on it really. A nice explanation of evolution.&rdquo; She waved away her guest&#39;s concern. &ldquo;It is quite relevant to the subject at hand. Be patient.&rdquo; She flipped the cover open to the title page, <i>The Evolution of Consciousness</i>. &ldquo;Not the most recent book on the topic, but one with a premise that illustrates your question perfectly.

Yves was going to take her time with this explanation; cutting to the chase would give grave injustice to a topic so very serious. &ldquo;Imagine the human organism as a ship, a great ocean liner with a crew of hundreds. You have that picture? Except instead of trained and resourceful crew you have a collection of simple creatures. One knows how to keep the boiler running but is pointless for navigation. Another can read the waves but has no concept of stars. Et cetera et cetera, hundreds of these specialized simpletons. Together, for different reasons, they manage to sail this ship. After all there have been billions of ships, and simple odds say that <i>some </i>of them will survive.&rdquo;</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif"">&nbsp;</font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif"">The guest nodded, fussed a little, urged Yves to continue if there was more to say.</font></font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif"">&nbsp;</font></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><font face=""Times New Roman, serif"">&ldquo;<font face=""Times New Roman, serif"">Now, in all of those simple-creature crewmen, you have one whose job it is to watch the clock. It can think back, hmmm, a couple hours ago the weather was fine, and now it&#39;s choppy. So says the weather creature. It can think forward: now we have enough fuel, but soon we will be low again, so says the fuel creature. For all this fine thinking our clock-watcher fancies himself bright. He puts the clock by the wheel and tells the wheelman (who ignores him half the time) where to steer, and imagines himself the captain, imagines himself a <i>self,</i> the mind of the ship. He&#39;s wrong of course; the ship has no mind, it is only wood and metal and a hundred very lucky simple creatures. And this, Mr. Ornstein tells us, is the human mind.

It was the look of a mind being blown apart by a radical new idea then reforming around that idea, shattered momentarily and then whole as though whole were an inevitable state. &ldquo;And the ship is the Host, and we were all one Godhead once. And then we&mdash;at the time <i><b>I</b></i>&mdash;chose to shatter myself, to break the Mind into its component parts.&rdquo; The guest was horrified; Yves was saying in essence that God was mad and had committed suicide. &ldquo;Why? I don&#39;t recall exactly. There was something to be learned. Perhaps there was something to be tested: would we reassemble? Can we? Can we ever be One again? I don&#39;t know, but I believe. That&#39;s what we have, isn&#39;t it? Faith.

Why else leave Heaven but to move among humanity, to protect them? And incidentally to see what Whole looks like. Oh sure, whole but wildly imperfect.

"event","As Janus rolled up to Michael&#39;s tent he was greeted with &quot;Oh, not you too!&quot;&nbsp; This was an uncharacteristically unfriendly greeting from his older brother, who showed not a hint of a jest in the words.<br /><br />&quot;Why are you so irritated, Michael.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Just got a visit from one of Blandine&#39;s people, raving about keeping secrets and Indian gifts, and on and on.&nbsp;<br /><lj-cut><br />And the worst part?&quot;&nbsp; Between the lines he saw part of the problem was that Michael couldn&#39;t fight this, had to simply talk it out with... &quot;The message included an insinuation that I was hiding truths from her by not speaking to her personally.&nbsp; <i>Through a messenger</i>.&quot;&nbsp; Michael was in a fine mood indeed.<br /><br />&quot;Indian gifts?&nbsp; What?&quot;&nbsp; Janus eyed his sword invitingly, and Michael considered whether that would take the edge off his anger, and whether that was wise.&nbsp; The two angels circled each other, deciding whether combat was an answer or a distraction.<br /><br />&quot;The Dylan brothers.&nbsp; One of the cadre of spies we found.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You mean the guys I nearly poached for myself?&nbsp; And may yet?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The very ones.&nbsp; One of them has been dragged into the Marches, and Blandine seems to think their prior history had something to do with it.&nbsp; As if Spies himself...!!!&quot;<br /><br />Janus swung his sword, punctuating his verbal cutting-off.&nbsp; &quot;Nobody trusts Spies, except you and Dominic.&nbsp; It&#39;s one of the Host&#39;s finer jokes.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;So that&#39;s what was so funny...&quot;&nbsp; he didn&#39;t need to mention Asmodeus, knew that Janus knew about their little beer and darts sessions. &quot;Still, how far to take this?&nbsp; Take the surgical approach and risk losing the guy?&nbsp; Marc was right you know.&nbsp; Those soldiers have a union.&nbsp; I let one down, we all have to deal with all of them.&nbsp; And Spies, and Corat, who is just so recently made whole again.&nbsp; Ugly, ugly.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He&#39;s not the only one.&nbsp; You should hear Khalid.&nbsp; He&#39;s thinking of giving up his Bright, for her sake.&quot;<br /><br />Janus blinked, and nearly got whacked with a sword.&nbsp; He just stood there.&nbsp; &quot;You&#39;re serious?&quot;&nbsp; Michael nodded, and Janus resumed combat.&nbsp;<br /><br />Somewhere in San Francisco, Corat was looking for an ass to kick, to complete the rite.&nbsp; Unfortunately his phone kept ringing, and he couldn&#39;t just let it.&nbsp; He wondered briefly if Zadkiel had an opening... or if Glen would loan him one of his conquests.<br /><br />Michael listened to his servitor, grateful that its messenger was an Ofanite.&nbsp; They could talk fast.&nbsp; &quot;So there&#39;s an ethereal loose in L.A.&nbsp; So why don&#39;t I bend Laurence&#39;s ear and put together a two-pronged attack.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Because he would veto it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Would he?&nbsp; Why is that?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Because a frontal attack on the Marches invites the two lovers into mutual annihilation.&nbsp; And a frontal attack on L.A. is not only a potential loss but it begs the other side to counterattack.&nbsp; Which begins a war that breaks open our secrets and kills a couple billion human beings in the process.&quot;<br /><br />Michael smirked.&nbsp; It was not a pretty thing.<br /><br />&quot;Michael!&nbsp; It is not that time and you know it!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Do I?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;There are <i>signs</i>.&nbsp; They are <i>not </i>there.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What if somebody killed Gabriel?&nbsp; Then the signs would never be there...would that change the day or the hour?&quot;<br /><br />Janus&#39; eyes grew wide.&nbsp; &quot;Much as I enjoy the idea of wiping the slate clean, brother, you know this is wrong.&quot;&nbsp; It&#39;s clear Michael&#39;s entertaining the thought, so Janus puts his full weight and speed into the attack.&nbsp; It pulled him out of his reverie a minute.&nbsp; &quot;And if--big if--this full-scale war happens and it&#39;s not the time, and demons and angels weaken each other and the human race, what is left?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Dreams.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Ethereals.&quot;&nbsp; They said it in unison.&nbsp; It was a brilliant plan, if they were right, or maybe just an extraordinarily lucky one.&nbsp; But luck was with them too.&nbsp; A passing angel caught a snippet of their conversation and added in one more thought.<br /><br />&quot;Remember Uriel.&quot;<br /><br /></lj-cut><br />"

"event","Glen prepares a ward he expects will protect Shiro in transit, because he&#39;s going to summon him back to San Francisco and safety.&nbsp; He takes Dennis&#39; advice and abuses Bruce, demanding a hit of Essence for the task.&nbsp; Ryuki doesn&#39;t plan to summon the angels, just build a distraction so the demons are too busy elsewhere to hassle them on their way out.&nbsp; He calls in a favor from an Eric in L.A. who builds a quickie rave, the better to call funloving people and the demons who prey on them...and heck, just some funloving demons.&nbsp;<br /><br />Kingman meanwhile is trying to be clever, since he&#39;s clearly facing overwhelming force.&nbsp; He&#39;s telling himself he&#39;s a good guy but he&#39;s not convincing the angels of this.&nbsp; Corat finds a bookshelf full of jars, which will prove to be very important.&nbsp; See, when Kingman lies that he&#39;s not holding anyone hostage, he&#39;s lying about the beings in those jars.<br /><br />Kane gives up on Kingman and tries to bring his young--and apparently uninitiated--apprentice into the fold.&nbsp; Kingman makes the painful mistake of attacking Zahirah and gets hamstrung by the Malakite...literally.&nbsp; Ryuki yells for the angels to spare his life, until his uncle arrives wounded--then he&#39;s all murder.&nbsp; Sunae tries to contain him and his anger, but he tells her all he wants is to let his uncle back into his briefcase/anchor, and then he wants to take a walk to calm down.&nbsp; There&#39;s one message left that Shiro needs to convey, if he has the stuffing left to convey it...<br /><br />Kingman does the math and realizes that he&#39;s going to Hell and taking what he knows with him, so why tell the angels anything at all?&nbsp; Apparently the jars contain some serious baddies and the angels want to know who.&nbsp; Kane resorts to cool, small, calculated torture.&nbsp; Zahirah objects by trying to put herself between Kingman and the nasty sword.&nbsp; Even Ida, the normally quiet Mercurian, has a problem with this.&nbsp;<br /><br />Meanwhile we discover that Ryuki&#39;s &quot;talking a walk to let off steam&quot; involves walking into a room full of fellow sorcerers and banishing anyone who tries to get away from the walking tantrum.&nbsp; This does irritate the two angels who were going to get medieval on Bruce, but they let him go with a stern warning/threat.&nbsp; Nisroc will later kibosh any plans for retaliation, to the frustration of those angels.&nbsp;<br />Sunae, and I quote, &quot;doesn&#39;t dare leave him unattended&quot; and is less concerned by the use of a pack of mints as a reliquary and more concerned by banishing demons in a crowded room.&nbsp; But, he says, that&#39;s kind of the point.<br /><br />Kane promises Kingman a swift and merciful death if he talks.&nbsp; It&#39;s down to that.&nbsp; Kane wants to leave a message of comfort for his beloved blue-haired lady customers, but Kane says no.&nbsp; They need hard truth, not pretty comforting lies.&nbsp;<br /><br />Corat&#39;s talking to a scared DeShawn and watching a pack of demons milling around just outside one of the wards, the far outer ward apparently being broken.&nbsp; Kane runs him through for his treachery, and if the slaughter god&#39;s passing didn&#39;t wake the whole supernatural neighborhood the sound of unnatural death probably did.<br /><br />Kane offers to label the jars for them but instead hurls one down, breaking its seal.&nbsp; Inside it is an ethereal of slaughter and human sacrifice, but one smart enough to boogie out of there.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ash changes Superiors, with Gabriel&#39;s blessing.&nbsp; He shows up with an ambulance so they can all get out of there with the jars.&nbsp; Unfortunately there are too many of them and those.&nbsp; Kane calls on the inspiration of Creation, who reminds him that L.A. has its own <i>mobile</i> tether.<br /><br />In the confusion DeShawn says that Kingman taught the Baron to shore up wards, but since everyone&#39;s in a panic no one followed up on that.&nbsp; Ahem.&nbsp;<br /><br />The angels need to ramp up the distraction, so Sunae calls the cops on the rave.&nbsp; Marc&#39;s ice cream truck is not far away and it arrives not long after it&#39;s called.&nbsp; The driver, an older man soldier named Gilbert, says to hide the fact that they (the angels or their helpers) arranged the rave and bust.&nbsp; Wouldn&#39;t want the demons who consider L.A. theirs to throw a tizzy about angelic interference.<br /><br />Kingman arrives at the gates of Hell and sings like a canary.&nbsp; This will affect things down the line.<br /><br />Ryuki warns Corat not to mess with the jars or even talk around them, but he&#39;s not taken seriously.&nbsp; Corat goes celestial to look around the neighborhood, then goes old-school to wound the three lingering demons with a longbow courteously provided by Gilbert.&nbsp; And then they truck it outta there.&nbsp; Space is tight and Corat insists on riding on the roof.&nbsp; He has to be asked to do it lying down and not preening like an overarmed Cupid.&nbsp; Gilbert leads the caravan to Griffith Park.&nbsp; Briefly they have someone following them but they manage to shake him.<br /><br />And the jars whisper among themselves.<br /><br />Corat shoots three loitering demons just to keep them from running to anyone with the news, and tells them to keep quiet in case they&#39;re too dumb to get the message.&nbsp; With Kingman dead it&#39;s up to DeShawn to label the jars, and he actually does a decent job of it.&nbsp; Granted, <i>names</i> would have been awfully useful.<br /><br />There&#39;s some discussion about whether DeShawn can be trusted, but the two sorcerers know from experience exactly how to motivate someone like him.&nbsp; It&#39;s not nice, but it&#39;s right.&nbsp; Ryuki tips his hand that he wants folks to be at least even-handed with the ethereals in those jars.<br /><br />Gilbert consults the Seneschal, a Kyrio in a flock of birds, who tells them their tail will show up in about fifteen minutes but that they can get away with a bit of noise until then.&nbsp;<br /><br />Back in San Francisco Glen packs up his book booth with the aid of his &#39;slave&#39; and tosses it in the back of a large old car.&nbsp; Well I suspect he put the demon in the front seat so folks in the back could keep an eye on him.&nbsp; Meanwhile Ryuki&#39;s a bit twitchy--he&#39;s still got his uncle in his suitcase, and though he&#39;s not mentioning it both he and Shiro were wounded in the last battle.&nbsp; Sunae catches the edginess and gives him the permission he wants to go home and take care of the family. Glen drops his things off at his bookstore.<br /><br />The angels sort the jars into talking and non-talking and DeShawn labels them, moving four of the non-talking ones out of their pile.&nbsp; Then they try to move the jars through the ice cream truck tether to a theater tether in San Francisco.&nbsp; All go except two.<br /><br />Ryuki gets home and talks to his father, never an easy thing to do, and gets his blessing on his new career path.&nbsp; At first he forgets the important thing, but after a nap he remembers to tell his dad about the peace agreement Shiro had brokered.&nbsp; Ryukawa mentions he wants to de-fund the Oahu office, and old battle between these two, but he leaves it unsolved.&nbsp; Ryukawa is not heartless--after Ryuki&#39;s nap he&#39;s found sitting in his easy chair, holding the briefcase and trying to hide the tears.<br /><br />And Bruce is being a pain in the butt.<br /><br />Now the Seneschal of the Hilltop tether is a partisan soul and not at all happy to be dealing with a Warrior instead of a Windy, but there&#39;s a war on and she&#39;ll help her own side.&nbsp; He says he&#39;s calling one of Eli&#39;s soldiers to help identify the jars and this soothes her a bit.&nbsp;<br /><br />Kane has Sunae&#39;s sword and they&#39;re in lurv.<br /><br />Corat and the angels take the jars through to the Hilltop but two of them won&#39;t go.&nbsp;<br /><br />Kane offers to have some stoners he knows repaint a disguise for the ambulance.&nbsp; Ash takes a pass.<br /><br />Ryuki&#39;s still out dealing with his family thing, Ash has the ambulance with the corpse and the two balky jars,&nbsp; so everyone&#39;s just trying to get to the same spot now.<br /><br />"

"event","So it occurs to Dennis that sorcery doesn&#39;t work on him anymore, and won&#39;t Ryuki be surprised? &nbsp; Ryuki who&#39;s hawking a book to Glen, his favorite (book) dealer.&nbsp; Dennis and Mitch offer to stash Bruce in a hotel room but Bruce is wise to this (non-) trick, where he sits in a hotel room waiting for black-winged doom.&nbsp; Mitch then asks Dennis why he&#39;s got such a hard-on to beat up Ryuki, and the explanation buys him some stalling time.&nbsp; (It&#39;s because Ryuki demanded Dennis count the wards in another wizard&#39;s lair...by walking through them.)

Kane hears Sunae talking about being in drag and Bruce talking about being dragged to death and decides the latter is more interesting. &nbsp; Awkwardly he interrupts the smooth operator...

Dennis prepares to do bodily harm to the guy who&#39;s cockblocking his demon ex-buddy.&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; Bruce encourages this.

When it comes to contacting ghosts, Zahirah would trust Ryuki over the Baron Samedi.&nbsp; And is willing to say so to her boss.&nbsp; Is the world upside-down?

Then Ryuki recognizes Dennis and Bruce as &#39;those two demons&#39; and offers to bag &#39;em for his dealer buddy Glen.&nbsp; Glen agrees and It&#39;s Showtime!&nbsp; Ryuki goes into full David Copperfield meets Jackie Chan mode and sliiiides Bruce into a little ribbon trap just so.&nbsp; Smooth.&nbsp; And then Dennis charges.&nbsp; Smoothly he puts up a hand to banish the, um...he&#39;s not a Djinn anymore?&nbsp;

Glen doesn&#39;t even wait for Ryuki to get his balance back before he starts wheeling and dealing with Bruce.&nbsp; It&#39;s cheaper to cut a deal with a captive demon, just not--at least in Bruce&#39;s case--not as effective in stopping sneakiness.&nbsp; Once the deal is made Glen releases him by picking up the ribbon.&nbsp; Oooh Ryuki&#39;s gonna want that back.

Lucky for Ryuki he&#39;d made arrangements with Ida who makes Dennis&#39; limbs go all rubbery, and the Malakite of Creation turned a box of pencils into a foundation of sand..&nbsp; Then Ryuki lays a magic Charm on--since he won&#39;t get through to Dennis--four innocent bystanders who think it&#39;s their mission to make peace here.&nbsp; Attack of the hippies!&nbsp; Dennis is neutralized.

Everyone&#39;s annoyed at Mitch for failing to mention he had a demon in tow.

Sunae offers Kane the use of her sword, should he need it.&nbsp; He&#39;ll need it.

Bruce makes noise, he&#39;s ringing in my ear...and draws Kane&#39;s and Zahirah&#39;s attention.&nbsp; Meh, that sorcerer&#39;s got him under control, for now.

Ryuki comes onto Zahirah hard, or at least that&#39;s what he wants the room to believe.&nbsp; It&#39;s a cheap excuse to whisper in her ear--how wrong is that?--to get the group together somewhere where they can talk privately.&nbsp; They post Dennis with Bruce at Glen&#39;s booth and variously make their ways to room F.

Ryuki insults Dennis in Helltongue.&nbsp; Apparently the descendant of translators has picked up one or two choice words.&nbsp; But talking to Glen he found the gesture worked better, putting Glen&#39;s hand on the unnaturally cold handle of his briefcase, formerly his late uncle&#39;s briefcase.&nbsp; His uncle is hanging around tonight, and Glen is an occasional medium.&nbsp; Glen gets dragged to room F while he prepares to summon Uncle Shiro there.

Corat reminds Kane not to start anything--because Malakim need reminding of that sort of thing--because he has to finish whatever gets started.

Shiro is apparently a smart-ass, even in death, even with a chunk of skull missing.&nbsp; Yep, runs in the family apparently.&nbsp; Little wonder they were run out of Nagasaki.&nbsp; He asks to possess someone since apparently sarcasm doesn&#39;t do well secondhand, and refuses Ryuki&#39;s offer because he needs to talk to him.&nbsp; Instead, Sunae steps up and Shiro is charmed.&nbsp; Being inside a woman is happy no matter how literally inside you get.&nbsp;

Glen tries to up his fee.&nbsp; Corat plays the War card.&nbsp; Glen gets very reasonable.

Shiro is a talkative guy but easily as suspicious as the rest of his family.&nbsp; He tells a tale of the rat in the shrine to prove he&#39;s him, at least to Ryuki.&nbsp; Then he asks Ryuki if he&#39;s still healthy and sane, &#39;cos he hasn&#39;t made the moves on Zahirah yet.&nbsp; Um, angel.&nbsp; Um, nun.&nbsp; He makes his acquaintance, then at Sunae&#39;s suggestion asks for a sake, the better to settle into a tale.

First, he speaks of a swampy guy trying to con ghosts our of their Essence.&nbsp; No fool Shiro, but he&#39;s also smart enough to see that a ghost who&#39;s fading away might grasp at that straw at the end.&nbsp; He also found a spooky little girl who seemed to be a message in a bottle from Azrael, telling anyone who wanted to know what the rules of being dead are.&nbsp; He also told everyone what his neice had confessed to him at his shrine, that she&#39;d called Psychic to the Celebrities Jerry Kingman to try to get Shiro&#39;s answer to his brother&#39;s question, permission for Ryuki to become an undercover, er, cop.

They are soon joined by Pavel (Ryuki&#39;s friend), and Mia and Ken (his paternal siblings).&nbsp; Snug.&nbsp; Ken sets down the cake and leaves, still reeling from being at the helm of the real estate department during a crash.&nbsp; Ryuki decides that <b>this</b> is a good time to ask his father about working for angels...in front of everybody.&nbsp; Pavel gets it, the angels get it, his father doesn&#39;t get it...&quot;IHS&quot;?&nbsp; But he explains it&#39;s undercover law enforcement and that he gets.&nbsp; Ryukawa, dubious about all this, lays down a gauntlet.&nbsp; Ask your uncle.&nbsp; Your late uncle.&nbsp; The one who was probably murdered by Japanese cops or their mob friends.&nbsp; How you manage that is up to you.<br /><br />His sister Mia...well, she&#39;s hellllllping!&nbsp; She knows a phone psychic who can hook them up.&nbsp; Well, Ryuki knows that phone psychic too, as a fellow sorcerer and a con artist (like, he might argue, most sorcerers) who would gladly box him up and send him to a demon for a bribe.&nbsp; So Ryuki does what any man in his family would do when threatened--he attacks!&nbsp; His younger sister&#39;s phone!&nbsp; Ryukawa is mortified--so much for being the calm, refined family.&nbsp;<br /><br />But enough drama for one episode.&nbsp; Ryuki puts &quot;call dead uncle&quot; and &quot;tie up sister&quot; on his to-do list and the lot go downstairs to a local pub.</lj-cut><br /><br /><br />"

"event","<em>Well, that went better than I expected.</em>&nbsp; Ryuki sat down on his bed to gather his thoughts, and to sober up enough to contact his uncle Shiro.&nbsp; Shiro and he had often been drinking buddies, so being a little tipsy and smelling of bar might get his attention, let him enjoy the nostalgia.&nbsp; Being dead had to suck, and Ryuki would provide any little comfort he could.&nbsp; Instead of washing, as was the usual prerequisite for talking to <em>kami</em>, he went to the shrine garden as he was, stopping in the kitchen for a bowl of rice to offer.&nbsp; Miyako gave him token resistance, it was her kitchen and how dare a man defile it.<br /><br />Ryuki gave the proper greetings to the spirits that had been his family members, clapping and bowing in the correct sequence and leaving a few pennies in the box.&nbsp; He then walked off the path and over the gravel to his uncle's marker, careful not to cross the paths of the guide statues.&nbsp; He knelt at the shrine and left the bowl of rice there, chatting briefly and intimately with Shiro as he had done often in both life and death.&nbsp; A tiny cold spot drifted through his space, settling momentarily on the briefcase at the shrine's base, the one that Shiro had on him the night he died.&nbsp; As a sign it was ambiguous, but Ryuki had faith.&nbsp; As much as he tested and teased, in this he had faith.<br /><br />On the plane late that night he laughed to himself.&nbsp; The two new angels, neither was a seraph or at least not a sensitive one.&nbsp; He knew the <a href=""http://www.sjgames.com/in-nomine/articles/Resources/sillyartifacts.html"">Squeaky Hammer</a>--you don't forget a name like that.&nbsp; And he knew the demons bragged that it had been Dominic's booby prize, a silly MacGuffin that nobody knew quite what it was supposed to do.&nbsp; They had laughed mightily at the thought of Heaven's stiffest upper lip having a cloak that squeaked.<br /><br />Neither angel had called him on the lie.<br /><br />He wondered what mission they were really sent for, and whether they themselves knew.&nbsp; He kept his copy of the address book, counting himself the unofficial faceman for Corat's misfits.&nbsp; <br /><br />Shiro had a pet mouse--not something he would have kept in life, but found by necessity now that he was dead, and transported to America on top of it.&nbsp; He slipped his psyche into the mouse, carefully watching the house before letting himself into the garden.&nbsp; They'd left his spirit a path out of the garden, so his rage at the injustice of his death would not be visited on his family.&nbsp; Mostly he left them be, but it kept his humanity alive to be treated to the occasional bowl of rice, and the mouse gave him the feel of a full belly, always a pleasant and grounding thing.&nbsp; Dammit his nephew forgot the sake!&nbsp; <br /><br />Ryukawa knew about the shrine visits, knew about the mouse, knew how often the kids snuck into the kitchen late at night when their mother/stepmother was not guarding it.&nbsp; He felt no need to interfere or even to get out of bed.&nbsp; His castle was secure.<br /><br />Ryuki slept on the plane but not well enough, having no tether Disturbances to rock him to sleep.&nbsp; His daughter used him as a pillow to watch Saturday morning cartoons, though he suspected she was humoring him, getting a little old for that stuff.&nbsp; Besides which, mornings on Oahu were so much more interesting outside."

Which would be a real handy trick right about now, if he could control it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But noooo, he goes around spending Essence like it's quarters in a dollar store, dropping a couple of noisemakers in trash cans--one of which Sunae picks up, and sees what's inside.&nbsp; Unmentionables.&nbsp; Eeeww.&nbsp; He tries to shake off Shenmachel but he just won't go, well except for a couple hours earlier when Ryuki stepped out for dinner and some bokken.&nbsp; So he has these bokken and gets to spar with an angel of the Sword, and of course gets his ass kicked but is happy just to have put up a solid defense and um, not get killed.&nbsp; He and Sunae compare scars, and it's just no contest.&nbsp; He can't even get that cute little orderly alone for a quickie, and if he weren't, um, surrounded by angels who he's been obsessed with pretty much since he figured out what they are, if it weren't for that teensy little detail the night would be wasted.<br /><br />If he only knew that the renegade demon that he'd gouged was getting redeemed, by Marc of all of them.&nbsp; He's still in debt to Ruby though, the demon queen of L.A., and that hasn't come to call yet.&nbsp; He owes her a walk into angel territory and information she can use on Corat and Ryuki.<br /><br />The Andersons look like pretty solid folk.&nbsp; Atheism aside they're damned perfect missionaries.&nbsp; The Dylan boys take Sunae out to dinner and they're damned perfect dates...well except for the part where Shenmachel's boss Hamael pulls him upstairs, leaving the wiz alone to do shenanigans.<br /><br />Corat wakes up and after a tearful reunion--no, not manly men!--calls for his angel crew to figure out what's up.&nbsp; Dominic's wigged on to it all, that's what's up.&nbsp; Three days from now there's supposed to be a big powwow.&nbsp; Ha.&nbsp; More like three hours.&nbsp; He realizes Ryuki's left his laptop in the room with a webcam on, and the party has to talk him down from spying on his little buddy who is obviously spying on him.&nbsp; Instead he talks about Marty, Kevin, Danae, the rest of them as well as Ryuki's teacher James.&nbsp; And Hayley definitely has a demon on staff, as they're about to discover rather dramatically.<br /><br />It seems the recruits have all managed to meet each other, get each others' contact information, and get together for a serious talk that includes Ryuki despite the surveillance he's been under.&nbsp; Clever little bunch of people, or should I say unit?<br /><br /><p>So the angels and soldier traipse out to the tour bus and knock on the door, and the recruits all file outside to chat.&nbsp; Little do they know the demon Vetis has traipsed out with them, hopping from bus driver to tour manager with Shedite ease.&nbsp; And it hops, and hops again, and while everybody's figuring everybody else out it hopes into Danae the telepath whose mind can tell it who everybody is underneath.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that he's the only one--it seems that Kevin stole Corat's dossier book, copied it, and put it back.&nbsp; So that's how they're all connected.<br /><br />And then Shelley tries to hook up with, or unhook the fly of, Ryuki.&nbsp; Not her fault really, just a Shedite taking an educated guess at where a sorcerer's weakness is.&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; It hops into Ryuki but waits for the chance to strike.&nbsp; How'd he manage to get a married woman to molest the guy in front of everyone?&nbsp; You'll Never Do Lunch in This Town Again if you don't know.&nbsp; He wants the book to send back to Nybbas, just needs to get it out of there.&nbsp; Ash outs the demon and a fight ensues, and Vetis twists Ryuki's arm long enough to make the jump into Kevin.&nbsp; No literally, twists his arm.<br />&nbsp;</p>And oh yeah, they have an audience.&nbsp; A dozen or three angels from the hospital, just watching.&nbsp; That Shedite ain't going nowhere.&nbsp; Well except maybe between people--he manages to play the shell game with a couple of the recruits before being found out, at which point he tries to fall on Sunae's sword.&nbsp; Nope, just gets shoved out into a nice little ribbon port-a-ward.&nbsp;&nbsp; It/he uses his last bargaining chip, which is trying to convince Ryuki that the angels will turn on his &quot;Hawaiian girl&quot;.&nbsp; Nope, just pisses the wiz off which is fuel for the banishing.&nbsp; <br /><br />So they've got a wounded tube-o-demon and Zahira wants to give it a chance to redeem itself.&nbsp; Bring on the archangels!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we discover just how important this group is, because Janus shoves Eli out of his car and then swings back around to join them.&nbsp; Khalid was nearby anyway in his Dr. Sexy vessel, so he steps out to address the demon problem.&nbsp; Mr. Personality i.e. Sunae's grandfather shows, and a couple of the recruits (and Ash) want to assault him for slapping a woman.&nbsp; Other archangels pop in, Gabriel, Michael and Marc, and Nisroc, not necessarily in that order.&nbsp; It seems Ryuki's <em>sensitive</em>, as Gabriel's appearance makes him pass out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once he wakes up and realizes how close he came to getting snuffed without calling his Hawaiian girl, Ryuki gets a little angsty.&nbsp; He doesn't like what the Symphonic sense has done with his family and Eli's dancing around that subject.&nbsp; The recruits form a unit, a union really and discuss what they want from being recruited, while Eli keeps intruding with personal questions about Ryuki's parentage.&nbsp; Somehow they manage to get a coherent list to negotiate with, and are about to present it when...Dominique strides in.<br /><br /><br /><p>Now he/she's doing her best to be reassuring, what with the curvy Latina vessel and all, but there's a limit with a reputation like Dom's.&nbsp; And then when Khalid insists on her covering up, that doesn't help.&nbsp; She's clearly got a bead on Eli and, possibly because he presents like a harmlessly addled old guy, the recruits are protecting him.&nbsp; And Ash, poor dear, is attuned to Ryuki and Sunae who have their hands linked with Zahira...and Dom doesn't like the idea of a sorcerer.&nbsp; And Ryuki doesn't like the idea of an archangel in the family tree, even indirectly, and wants desperately to sock Eli in the face.&nbsp; Which nobody's going to let him do.&nbsp; It appears though that he's no so special, that Eli was handing out Symphonic sense like kisses back in '57, which doesn't make Dom <em>or </em>Ryuki happy with him.<br /><br />Mitchim wisely suggests taking this argument away from the n00bs.<br /><br />Nisroc, seeing the price of peace, tries to maneuver folks into letting Ryuki get that swing, but it doesn't look good...</p><br />"

"event","My English-language students wanted to play cards today and I indulged them, provided they explain the game to me...in English.&nbsp; I even ended up playing some, but damn.&nbsp; Can anyone make sense of this?

Start by dealing a hand of five cards.&nbsp; Determine direction of play.

There's a play pile, a draw pile, and a discard pile.&nbsp; Dealer lays out a card in the play pile.&nbsp; Player matches either suit or number of the card in the play pile.&nbsp; Straightforward so far, right?

If a player is down to one card in her hand, someone has to say 'one card'.&nbsp; If it's the player, all other players draw one card.&nbsp; If someone else says it first, the player with one card must draw another.&nbsp; First player to run out of cards wins.

If you can't play any card, draw one more.&nbsp; However, under circumstances that still aren't clear to me, you may have to draw a number of cards based on the top card in the play pile:
red card:&nbsp; draw 15
black card:&nbsp; draw 13
Ace:&nbsp; draw 11
Deuce:&nbsp; draw 2
3:&nbsp; draw none

ugh, time to go.&nbsp; Will type more later."

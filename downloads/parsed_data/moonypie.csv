http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/may/13/michael-sheen-hamlet-young-vic

http://nationaltheatrewales.org/content/passion

I was just telling Julie yesterday, or the day before, that I didn't think Sheen was going back to theater anytime soon because he's been doing so many films.

Hence, my total surprise when I read today, by chance, that he'll be playing Hamlet in 2011 in London. I investigated and discovered, as can be read above, that he'll be doing a show around Easter in his native Port Talbot. 

Now, I know not many on my flist care because...who the hell is Michael Sheen anyway?...but fuck it...

If I have to sell a kidney - for whatever reason; money or just to say I had to sell a kidney - I AM GOING TO SEE MICHAEL SHEEN ON STAGE! There are no words to describe how excited I am that Sheen is doing theater in the UK in 2011. I honestly thought he'd gone pure movie-ness, but oh no! Quality man that he is, he will not give up the stage! 

So, that's John Simm on September 16 doing Hamlet (yeah, that's right; I'm watching the Master play Hamlet...word yo), and Sheen sometime in 2011 playing Hamlet. Plus, my Easter break spent in Cardiff stalking Skaski (*we hope*) and traveling to Port Talbot to see Sheen be all Welsh. 

Made.of.win.

Even after speaking with my Cursillo girls last night, who came up with a few good suggestions, I'm still inclined to just let it be and just not be on facebook. 

I mean really - how over-stimulated with technology can one girl be? I already spend an inordinate amount of time on the internet; I don't need a phone where I can constantly check my e-mails (thank you Welshie for getting me one to use in the UK!) and I don't need to continue to have a facebook account where I will inevitably cyber-stalk people.

Even though I know I am and will continue to miss out on events people no longer e-mail or call about, I am accepting this. It is a drawback, but then, whatever one chooses, there are always drawbacks.

Being in the UK may change my mind a bit, since I'll miss people, but still, I have the e-mail addresses of the people I care most about. And of course, I have LJ for my lovely flist! 

Cheerie-Bye.

RA&nbsp;really brought Thornton to life; they did a gorgeous job with the casting and directing; it was brilliantly written). <br /><br />A&nbsp;huge disappointment for me was LOTR. I think that is because the Fellowship of the Ring was so well adapted and I had so few complaints, I expected the other two films to be as good. They really let me down by what they did with Faramir, though. He is my favorite character in the LOTR&nbsp;novels, and poor David Wenham was trying so hard to do him justice, but they wrote him so terribly. I was gutted. <br /><br />Cheerie-Bye!"

Slept horribly though, as I've clearly pulled a muscle in my thigh and every time I would turn over, my hip would start aching and I'd wake up. No idea what I did in my sleep to injure myself thus. Oh well. <br /><br />The following is stolen from everyone. I've decided to finally fill one out as I could write a regular entry or something, but I just don't feel like it...<br /><br />Pick your five favorite TV shows (in no particular order) and answer the following questions. Don't cheat!<br /> <br /> 1. Rome<br /> 2. Buffy the Vampire Slayer<br /> 3. Highlander<br /> 4. Doctor Who<br /> 5. Outnumbered<br /> <br /> Results<br /> <br /> 01. Who's your favourite character in 2?<br /> Spike. In Seasons 1 and 2, it was Xander, but they just stopped developing his character, and Spike is made of win.<br /> <br /> 02. Who's your least favourite character in 1?<br /> ...do I need to say that bint's name? I can't even read about archeological finds in Egypt now because they always end up mentioning her...and she just makes me twitch, the slutty cow.<br /> <br /> 03. What's your favourite episode of 4?<br />I love, love, love the one with the statues...and now I&nbsp;can't remember the name of it. Oh, for shame!&nbsp;But it's that one and the Girl in the Fireplace.<br /> <br /> 04. What's your favourite season of 5?<br /> Well, there's only been two so far, and it's a really tough call, because Karen is just so ickle and stealable in the first, but my favorite episodes are the Wedding and the Airport, so I guess I'll say 2 just for that.<br /> <br /> 05. Who is your favourite ship in 3?<br /> Duncan and Methos. They are OTP whether the writers (or Methos...) admit it or not. (Because there is a 10th anniversary special where Methos is interviewed and claims Duncan isn't his type. Tch. Yeah, whatever.)<br /> <br /> 06. Who is your antiship in 2?<br /> Hmmm...I'll say that I dislike all of Willow's girlfriends (because her conversion to being a lesbian made absolutely no sense to me), and I'll say that a ship I wanted but never happened was Willow and Xander *sniffles* It was almost...almost...and then stupid writers!<br /> <br /> 07. How long have you watched 1?<br /> My brother let me borrow his Series 1 two years ago - so 2008 ish. It was after the show was over, of course. Rome aired while I was at SXU, and I never had time to dedicate myself to watching a TV show faithfully while I was in school. I was given the series with the express order that my parents were never to know - as, in John's words, &quot;There's a lot of sex and it's violent, and I don't want mom and dad to think I'm corrupting you or something *eye roll*&quot; Of course, I bought Series 1 and 2 for myself last year, and I watch episodes regularly because it's just such a brilliant show! The cast, the writing...except for the bint...it's utterly fantastic.<br /> <br /> 08. How did you become interested in 3?<br /> Well! I started watching Highlander in grammar school, around 6th grade, but I didn't become a fan until the last series was airing on primetime and the reruns of the early series were already on Sci-Fi. I caught all the episodes the summer of my sophomore year of high school (when I was about 15); they were on every single morning - it was back to back Dark Shadows, Forever Knight and then Highlander. And after that, I was hooked on Methos.<br /> <br /> 09. Who's your favourite actor/actress in 4?<br /> Ah, this is what makes it so devastating!&nbsp;The Tennant!&nbsp;Clearly. He just owned the Doctor, and I adored him.<br /> <br /> 10. Which do you prefer: Show 1, 2 or 5?<br /> ...<br /> <br /> No idea. Honestly, that's such a tough choice. Buffy was my first fandom; Rome is one of the best put together shows I've ever seen, but Outnumbered makes me laugh out loud no matter how many times I watch it. It's really impossible to say! *flails*<br /> <br /> 11. Which show have you seen more episodes of, 1 or 3?<br /> I'd say about the same. I've seen, at some point, every episode of Highlander - and there are 6 seasons of that. I've also seen every episode of Rome...several times. But again, I own series 3-5 of Highlander and have rewatched Methos' episodes a lot. So...aye, I'd say about the same.<br /> <br /> 12. If you could be anyone from 4, who would you be?<br /> Wow...tough call. Would I want to be the Doctor and fly around space and time in my Tardis?&nbsp;Or would I want to be one of his companions?&nbsp;I suppose I'm not one for a certain immortality; I wouldn't want to live 900 years. So, I'll say Sarah Jane Smith. Because she didn't 1.) get stuck in another dimension/universe, 2.) wasn't a bit of a prig to begin with and 3.)&nbsp;didn't end up married to Mickey because Russell Davies SUCKS. *cough*<br /> <br /> 13. How would you kill off your favourite character in 1?<br /> ...they did. <br /> <br /> But it's a toss up between Antony and Pullo anyway, and Pullo makes it through to the end, so I suppose I could think of a death for him. It would have to be truly epic, and he'd have to go down fighting though, because he's the ultimate soldier. In fact, the only way he could go would be fighting with the 13th. Thirteeeeeeeeeeeeeeen!<br /> <br /> 14. Give a random quote from 2?<br /> &quot;I may be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.&quot; - See? Spike = Made of Awesome.<br /> <br /> 16. Would a 3/4 crossover work?<br /> ...that would be made of win...I&nbsp;mean, I don't think it would work really. I&nbsp;just have this image of the Doctor getting sucked into the Game, and that probably wouldn't go over so well, but the Doctor meets Duncan MacLeod:&nbsp;priceless. I&nbsp;should write that just for fun. And then Methos can go, &quot;Oh, you're the Doctor?&nbsp;Yeah me, too. I've been Death, a doctor, you know...typical stuff.&quot; &quot;...Death?&quot;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, I'm one of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;...OH!&nbsp;That was YOU&nbsp;in the cheap mask and wig?&quot;&nbsp;&quot;...yes, well...it was the Bronze Age. Craftsmenship wasn't at its peak.&quot; <br /> <br /> 17. Pair 2 characters in 1 that would make an unlikely but strangely okay couple?<br /> Well, that's tricky. The idea of Pullo and Atia does hold a certain amusement...and I think they could make it work. <br /> <br /> 18. Has 5 inspired you in any way?<br /> Yes! Second gen...<br /> <br /> 19. Overall, which show has a better cast, 2 or 4?<br />Buffy or Doctor Who...Buffy or Doctor Who. You know, I might have to go with the overall consistency of Buffy. The fact that it's the same cast for seven series, pulling it together every show; I mean, the writing went down the toilet from seasons 4 - 6, but the cast always kept it together. Doctor Who changes every other season or so, so I have to give credit to a cast that works together for as long as they did on Buffy and still kept their characters interesting!&nbsp;<br /> <br /> 20. Which has better theme music, 3 or 5?<br /> Highlander. Even if Outnumbered had proper theme music...nothing beats Queen. Nothing! 		</lj-cut><br /><lj-cut text=""Just for fun...""><br />Cheerie-Bye!</lj-cut><lj-cut></lj-cut>"

"event","I took one for the team, non-Twilight readers, and I saw New Moon. Yes, I admit, I love Michael Sheen THAT much that I went to see a film I knew he would be in for 5 minutes (it was more like 10 really) when I hadn't even read the series or seen the first film. 

That being said, I admit I have no comparisons to draw and am commenting without bias (in so much as not having any expectations...other than that I wouldn't like the writing...which I didn't - no offense to Twilight fans). Let me say that much too: this isn't to give offense. I respect fandoms, given that I have been a member of many myself! I'm just critiquing a film...

Which ultimately has reminded me of how old I am. Not in terms of years, given that I'm only 24, but...well, I just didn't get it. All the angst...all the ""I can't live without you; OMG my heart is breaking, emotional turmoil, emotional turmoil all over a bloke."" It's supposed to be romantic and epic but...yeah, I don't get into that sort of romance anymore. It was much more appealing when I wasn't sitting here going, ""Right, marriage, babies, building a future with someone that is relatively normal and happy."" It's the same reason I stopped finding the Buffy/Angel romance appealing (apart from the fact Spike is clearly much cooler *cough*). Or even Romeo and Juliet...I just don't care about forbidden love or the drama drama drama of these relationships. I want simple; I like simple...sweet, even ordinary, stories that make me go, ""Yeah...I want that,"" or better yet, ""Wow, that's lovely...and attainable."" 

Plus, it bugs me to NO END that Bella's life falls apart when Edward leaves her. Her life...that wrapped around a boy...*shakes head* Be strong woman! Stop looking for a man to make you happy! (note: this is just what I got from the film; again, I have not read the books and so don't know if that's how it is in the novel)

ANYWHO! I loved Charlie. He was just lovely and I had a few moments where I awwwwwwwed. I was probably the only person in the theater except mothers who were there for their daughters who did, but whatever! And the lad who played Jake - there were some good scenes there! I was very convinced by his character and liked him a lot more than I liked Edward, but then 1.) I have a thing for werewolves and 2.) Edward wasn't in this enough to convince me...

But then, I also thought R-Pattz was awful. I was thoroughly unimpressed with his over-dramatic, cheesy portrayal, just as I wanted to smack Kristen Stewart throughout the entire film. It made me glad Sheen was in the one that featured Jake more than Edward.

As for Sheen...heh heh heh...all I have to say is, could the man have been any more campy? Bless him!

"event","And don't let anyone tell you different. <br /><br />Now, on to the post:<br /><br />Haven't been on LJ in a couple of days as I've just been...I don't know. The LJ and I don't see as much of each other since I graduated university. We'll have our brief affairs where I'll post twice in a day and then every day for a few days after, and then we'll need our space and I won't post or even go on for several days. Such is our relationship.<br /><br />And on a different note (we know how much I like to ignore transitions; I blame being an English major and having to write all those stellar papers - and they were, for the record, usually stellar *wink, wink*) -<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Love""><br /> I finished watching <i>Sparkhouse </i>Wednesday night. It puzzled me until this morning as to why I didn't like it. No, wait, I take that back, why I didn't like Carol and Andrew's relationship (Carol and Andrew = the sort of Heathcliffe and Cathy, as the story is a modern adaptation-ish of Wuthering Heights). Now, as most of you know, I like Heathcliffe's character about as much as I like being chased by a herd of wild boars, so it might not seem that surprising that I wasn't into the ""Andrew/Carol"" thing. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't just that. It wasn't <i>just </i>that Andrew was a putz and that he's sort of crazy (because who the hell attacks sweet, adorable John with a shovel?!). It's that I've gotten to the point where I find Andrew and Carol's relationship appalling. <br /> <br /> Soul mates? Destined to be together? ""I cannot live without my love""? It makes me roll my eyes. Why, you ask? It's not the sentimentality of it, actually. It's that Carol and Andrew are two people who <i>aren't good for each other</i>. In fact, from my viewing, I'd say those two brought out the worst in each other. But because there's a passion between them, a history, it's supposedly a ""great love"" (the same is true of the actual Heathcliffe and Cathy story).<br /> <br /> A great love? Really? Two emotionally unbalanced people who only serve to make each other more volatile because of their intense passion for one other; two people who bring out the selfishness in the other, ignoring the pain they cause other people who love them. That's considered great love?<br /><br />I've had ""exciting."" I've had ""passion."" And as with Carol and Andrew, I had it with a guy who usually didn't bring out my better qualities, because ultimately, our relationship was based around said ""passion."" It was love, sure. And though it's long since gone, all I have to do is remember how I acted and how miserable I felt when it ended to know it was a powerful love. <br /><br />But good? Great? No. Crazy, messed up Andrews don't know how to give the sort of love that sustains a relationship, the sort of love that, I think, leads to <i>genuine</i> happiness. Give me a John any day - a man who has a sense of duty and self-sacrifice, whose steady, kind nature, whose hard working attitude makes you want to emulate him. And sure, this John character has his faults - his awkwardness made me uncomfortable at times just watching him. <br /><br />But that's the sort of man who makes you want to be a better person. And personally, having had a relationship where there was always a certain thrill, I'd much rather have what some would consider a boring love - simple, genuine, with a man I respect and admire. No need for dramatic declarations of love next time. <br /><br />*shrug* At least they left the ending open-ended, so maybe Carol will learn to appreciate John...after she gets over Andrew the Tool.<br /><br /> </div><br />Cheerie-Bye!"

"event","Yes, Spring is in the air. <br /><br />How do I know? <br /><br />Well, I look outside and instead of the snow that had been plaguing Chicago all winter, I see rain...lots of rain...<br /><br />AND I can go outside without a coat (not that I recommend it as 50 degrees F isn't exactly ""warm""). <br /><br />Needless to say, this has sparked in me the desire to do things. Yes...<i>things</i>. <br /><br />And so, now that I am working and making decent money, I have been thinking about what I can do now that I have a regular schedule (not that crazy university one where I'm living at good ole SXU from 8:00 am to 11:00 pm Monday - Saturday...during tech/show weeks at least). <br /><br />And here's what I'm planning on trying to do for this summer:<br /><br />-Piano lessons (a must. This is the one thing I <i>will </i>do and plan to commit myself to unless I loathe and despise it and decide that the whole ""music ministry thing/working as a director for a Church"" isn't what I want after all.)<br />-Horseback riding lessons (because I've wanted to since I was ten, and you know what, I'm sick of saying I <i>want</i> to do things. I intend to do 3 months of lessons - that way, I will have at least some knowledge and will have fulfilled this burning desire to be like Sorsha from <i>Willow</i> - don't ask about that one...just let me have my crazy fantasies).<br />-Voice lessons (if I have the money - if not in May, then after the horseback riding lessons are over)<br /><br />Those are pretty simple things. There is so much I want to do, but I've decided to take it one step at a time; I've also realized, as with this horse riding business, that I can just try things. 3 months of something like horse riding is enough to satisfy the curiosity for me, and if I love it, I can always keep going and find a way to budget it in. <br /><br />After horseback riding, I'm going to look into trumpet lessons (depending on if I want/am taking voice lessons). It's time I picked up the old brass horn again. But we'll see with that one. That can get very expensive (as my trumpet is over ten years old now! Eeek!).<br /><br />Anyone care to join me in any of these endeavors? I figured I'd be going it alone, but I'm always up company and like to make sure people know they are welcome.<br /><br />Cheerie-Bye!"

As if I'm not educated or maybe if I just looked at it a different way I'd see the truth. <br /><br />Well, I have looked at it - many different ways, and for me, Catholic Christianity, Jesus, the Trinity, the whole thing, is the Truth.

I've always ""believed"" in God's love, but for the first time in my life, I understand and feel it. And I hate that I feel like I can't share that. <br /><br />No, I don't hate it. It makes me sad. Sad that people have lived so horribly that they've tainted Christianity/Catholicism for others. Sad that some people are so judgmental and critical.

I just did. *shrug* Few of you on my flist are Christian, so it might not mean as much as it could, but I think there are several parts of this that anyone would find beautiful...<br /><br />A Message from Jesus to a woman called ""Anne""<br /><br />""My dear friend, you will learn so much about love in heaven. You will look back at your time on earth and you will understand that many things that occurred to you were both exercises in love and opportunities to love. There is misunderstanding about love in the world but those who follow Me, My beloved apostles, seek to master love as I mastered love, in sacrifice. <br /><br />It is true that love creates joy. This is true. But when we take on love, it is also at times like taking on a burden which must then be carried. We should not decide for love and then, finding that love burdensome at times, set it down and walk away from it. This is not how it is done. On the contrary, if you love as I loved, you will find at times that the weight of love is heavy. I experienced this on Calvary when I carried My love for you to My death. Did I make the right decision, to pay the ultimate price for love? Of course I did. What else would I do, given the wonderful creation that is you? In the same way, I want each of My apostles to expect their love for Me to be a burden to them at times. This is normal. I want each of My apostles to expect their love for others to be a burden to them at times. This is also normal. In love, there are times when the decision to love feels light, of course, and there seems to be no burden to it at all. Rejoice in these times. In love, there are other times when the burden causes you to question your commitment. Do not be afraid of these times. This questioning is necessary for your growth. I experienced this, too. I was tempted toward an easier way. When love is tried this way and triumphs, that love becomes firmer and less likely to be disappointed later. Welcome the challenges to love, even while you decide for love. I will be with you in each situation, counselling you to humility and gentleness. View each challenge as a worthy exercise, allowed by heaven to teach you about eternity. See the opportunities to love all of those around you, particularly those whom you find it difficult to agree with at times.<br /><br />Please do not be alarmed when you are disappointed in love, when others fail you. This was also My experience and this will also benefit you because it will help you to learn forgiveness. I will bring you to greater holiness with each experience if you remember that I am with you and that I love you perfectly and completely. From the secure place that is My heart, you will go forward with self assurance, confident that you are cherished. This confidence will express itself in an increased ability to love those around you. <br /><br />Be at peace, dear apostles. My plan is such that you will learn to live like residents of heaven. All is well.""<br /></div> <br />Cheerie-Bye!"

I'm mostly back on the path of losing weight, though since every week day is a 12 hour day, I don't really have the time, energy or inclination to work out. 

I'm writing; mainly pointless things, and yet, it feels good to have ideas again - to write stories that people want to read.

I'm missing Scotland like crazy, and I'm sure as soon as the temperature gets warmer and things start to turn green again I will feel the sharp ache, the longing for distant shores. 

I'm happy to live with fantasy men until someone worthy comes along; I'm breaking myself of the googly eyed, flirty habit and have decided to give up on men all together for now because I still seriously question my judgment when it comes to men.

I would post all the reasons I hate working at the mag, but I am at work, and everyone is coming down for lunch - and as I am the unfortunate admin assistant *gags*, my desk is right by the lunch table.

Of course, my once supportive parents have turned the pressure on, and I fear the day Jim (the boss) tells me I can be hired on as a regular employee because I know my parents are going to say, ""Well...the job has benefits, it's full-time and you are at least working in a publishing environment."" *rolls eyes and bangs head on desk until I pass out* Yes...and oh how my mistakes this past week have taught me how to use a postage meter! Yes, the jobs looking for editing experience will be impressed by that. 

Sorry, I don't mean to rant and rave; I am grateful to have a steady gig that pays me money - I just feel myself getting stuck and a lot of my hope is fading away as less and less jobs I am qualified for are getting posted and I have not been on an interview in over a month.

Several cute new tops (mainly stuff I can wear to work AND out and about), a Russian composer (a CD...not the composer himself as that's just awkward), and a Monet calendar were nice, but the real treasures were, of course, the BBC DVD's, which were as follows this year: Doctor Who Series 3 and ""A Holy Wholly Happy Ending"" aka the series finale of the Vicar of Dibley with, you guessed it, Richard Armitage as the vicar's love interest.&nbsp;

Needless to say, my last few hours of Christmas were spent watching Blackadder's Christmas Carol with my cousins (as tradition and our love of Blackadder dictate) and RA being all cute and adorable and not the villain. Glorious.&nbsp;

And the giant Christmas Eve party didn't go so bad either. I mean, I was largely ignored by all my relatives, so I mostly avoided all their pitiful looks of ""Oh, she still hasn't found a full time job.""

Speaking of, here I sit, at another temp job doing reception. I dread my first phone call...it's not that I can't handle answering phones or something...I just fear dropping a call or something...oh wait...just got one and I think I may have dropped it (DAMN IT!). &nbsp;Anywho, receptionist also means sitting around all day...probably putzing around online (awww shucks...isn't that what I do at home anyway?) and reading Dostoevsky when I need a break...because lazy git that I am I've been reading The Idiot for the past five months!&nbsp;

Other news, while the holidays are my favorite time of year, I'm very excited they are pretty much over, as I'm sick of my ovaries acting up and prompting me to want a man.

"event","Well, Wednesday September 26 was a good day for Ms. Moony Griz!&nbsp;Staying good on the WW program worked, and I lost 3.6 pounds this week (I don't expect that to be a regular thing, but it was definitely needed). Even better, I checked my hotmail account this morning (set up strictly for job searching stuff), and I had an e-mail from one of the places I applied last week asking me to call and set up an interview (Tuesday at 2:00); super convenient, too, since&nbsp;the place is in the loop, and I can take the train (and oh yeah, this place actually IS hiring).

So, I'm feeling very encouraged right now, and I appreciate everyone who has been supporting me as I prattle on! Depending on how the interview goes and what the job is like, I may start prattling again - but I'm hoping something good will happen!

I was going to post an entire character thing earlier today (if only my stupid computer at work didn't suck), but now I'm just going to say that H.R.G./Noah Bennet is my favorite character. For real. Who'd have thought that on a show filled with attractive men I'd be asking for the older guy with the funny glasses to get as much screen time as possible? *Scenes tonight at his new paper company - AMAZING!*

Right, enough Heroes for now. I'll just leave you with this: An ice cream truck needs to run Angela Petrelli over. Don't ask me why it's an ice cream truck; I have no control when I'm painting the future.

It was not until yesterday that I realized Thomas Lennon was in the film. This made me say, ""Hey, I should have seen it!"" Now, while looking at <em>The State's </em>official website, I see that Thomas Lennon and Ben Garrant wrote the script, with Garrant directing the film! I am kicking myself because 1.) if the script was written by Lennon and Garrant it is sure to be hilarious and 2.) because I like supporting former State cast members.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anywho, I also found out that the two cute State cast members (Ken Marino and Michael Showalter) are still single, or at least unmarried. Not that I think I have a big chance, but for some reason, the relationship status of those actors and such who we like is very important (can I get an ""Amen""?).&nbsp;<br /><br />The real, and exciting news, the reason I was on the site, was because <em>The State </em>is finally coming out on DVD and will be out in October! All the episodes! Like I did when I got series two of <em>Doctor Who</em>, I am probably going to be a hermit every night until I watch the disks all the way through.&nbsp;AT LAST!

Alas, I am still jobless. I should get a call today from the place I had the phone interview for last week, but I'm not feeling positive that I'll get an in-person interview. I don't know why.&nbsp;I'm trying not to start wigging out, but I need to get insurance that isn't going to wipe out my savings in three months. After the call today, which I'm hoping I will get so I know where I stand, I am going to apply for jobs 11, 12, 13 and possibly 14. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that by application 20 or so I'll be at the considering hiring stage for some place. *head on desk* It's just all very discouraging.

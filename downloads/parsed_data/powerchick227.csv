Some people try to make it like there life is so hard and they cant believe it.What happens to you is up to you. I know i have fucked up in my life and i am not the poster child for  good advice. People tell you there is a 2 nd chance but people also have to move on.Not only boys but every one. Went to a party tonight for work but i got thrown in a pool but this guy Chris what an ass. I am leaving for sunset tomorrow and  am not sure when i get back so i wont be on for  a couple days then i have a wedding fri and my friends are throwing a summer prom on sat and i dont have a date cuz well i am not that good looking so i dont balm people.
 I cant see my contacks are all messed up.I made a promise to my self that this year would be different not like last years prosime. I am just going to be me and get over eveything and one . I am not going to live my life in the shadows and wait for my luck to come. I am going to just have fun and live up to what i know i can. Why wait ,why think one day my day will come nothing is going to come by acking you have to just do it.Dont ever think one day  its  gunna get better and you will know what to do .Just peace and love and keep your true friends and be yourself. Dont try to hard its not cool.

And you read all of my entries so I feel pretty special that you keep checking up on me and everything. And i know that you are trying to be hurtful to me. But I just wanted to say thank you for reading all about all of my problems and everything I am going through.
Thank you

"event","He always wanted to explain things.
But no one cared. 
So he drew.
Sometimes he would draw and it wasn't anything. 
He wanted to carve it in stone or write it in the sky.
He would lie out on the grass and look up at the sky. 
And it would be only the sky and him and the things inside of him that needed saying.
And it was after that he drew the picture.
He kept it under his pillow and would let no one see it. 
And he would look at it every night and think about it. 
And when it was dark and his eyes were closed, he could see it. 
And it was all of him.
And he loved it. 
When he started school he brought it with him. 
Not to show anyone, but just to have it with him like a friend. 
It was funny about school.
He sat in a square, brown room. 
Like all the other rooms.
And it was tight and closed.
And stiff.
He hated to hold the pencil and chalk.
With his arm stiff and his feet flat on the floor,
stiff.
With his teacher watching and watching.
The teacher came and smiled at him.
She told him to wear a tie like all the other boys.
He said he didn't matter. 
After that they drew.
And he drew all yellow and it was the way he felt about morning.
The teacher came and smiled at him.
""What's this?"" she said, ""why don't you draw like Ken's drawing""
""Isn't that beautiful?""
After that his mother bought him a tie. 
And he always drew rocket ships and airplanes like everyone else.
And he threw the old picture away.
And when he lay out alone looking at the sky.
It was big and blue and all of everything,
But he wasn't anymore.
He was a sweare inside the brouwn.
And his hands were stiff.
And the things inside of him that needed saying didn't need it anymore.
It had stopped pushing.
It was crushed.
Stiff.
Like everything else.

"event","Alright so people these past few days have been really really hard.Eric hasnt been doing all that great latly. And tuesday night he had to go to the hospital. He hasnt been able to get out of bed for a couple of days. I think its the kemo and everything but I dont really know. I have cried myself to sleep the past to nights and i have just a hard time with this. Eric has always been there for me and i have always gone to him when i needed someone but what happenes when he isnt there for me to go to? Its just that the docters thought he had beat if for a while there (it was like a month) They couldnt find any cancer in him. But then he went back in and they were just like ""oops look we found more cancer"". And that kind of pisses me off! Cause everything was alright for a while and then now its even worse. But im just really really scared for him right now. 
Keep Eric in your prayers please

OF COARSE YOU ALL DO....Well lightning stuck the side of my house causing a HUGE power surge....My TV is fried.....all of my lamps were crap...The Air Conditioning was toast...And of coarse the computer just melted.... So what did i do for entertainment in a house that is burning hot, has no tv...no electisity in my room?? OHH this is great...I organised my closit! WHOO HOO WHAT A FUN TIME....

Well now we have this new computer...and its all good in the hood(haha good stuff laura) AND MY CLOSET IS SOO CLEAN! We got the AC working again and got all the lamps fixed in my room... But that WAS one scary ass storm if i do say so myself...Had a heart attack when lighting hit the house....Whoa scary shit

Well then on yesterday...My dog had a little run in with a scunk...Awww my poor poor smelly pink dog.....My backyard still smells and she is pink from the tomato juice bath...

Well that was my week and Im just so glad to have a computer back...But allas i shall go now

luv you all

And just a whole lot of other crap happened. And me and laura got back from up north a couple of weeks ago... We had soo much fun and i got absolutly toasted! Well summer school is going just peachy other than the kid behind me smells like some kind of weird bread. So mainly life is going pretty good. And now its 12 more days until i get my braces off! I CANT WAIT... Nice straight teeth...It will be great but i keep having these crazy dreams that something goes wrong when they are taking them off..Last night i was knocked up...again...and they wouldnt take them off cause of that...

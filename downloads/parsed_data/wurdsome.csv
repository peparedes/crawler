"event","My first world problems don't seem so bad now that <a href=""http://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/"">Apple is giving rebates</a> to all the people who bitched and moaned about the iPhone price dropping after they bought theirs. I thought it was universally understood that ""early adopter"" was synonymous with ""i paid $200 more than I should have"". Did anyone at all think they were getting a bargain when they stood in line to buy a $600 phone?

I don't blame people for buying iPhones. They're cool. I want one, and I've been trying to calculate how long I have to hang on to my relatively new phone before i can justify upgrading again. But it's hard not to blame these people for taking their buyer's remorse out on Apple. If you don't balk at a $600 price tag on a phone, that kinda implies that you're ok with spending a couple hundred dollars more than you should.

Anyway, boo fucking hoo people."

"event","<a href=""http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/04/02itunes.html"">Apple Unveils Higher Quality DRM-Free Music on the iTunes Store</a>

Granted, letting consumers choose between crippleware and DRM-free music is a step in the right direction. Hmm, I wonder what they'll pick? (And please, make the right choice here people. It's 30 friggin cents.)

There are a couple of problems with this...

One, it's a little insulting to have to pay to ""upgrade"" music I already paid for and should be able to do whatever the hell I want with in my own home. But, screw it. If it really takes proof that consumers don't want DRM and that it provides them absolutely no value, fine. I'll play your little game. Hopefully some of the smaller labels that don't suck will be all over this and open up their catalogs as well.

Two, it's still AAC. Unless companies either open up their proprietary standards or additionally give consumers a choice between proprietary files or plain ol mp3s, they'll be doing as much harm as the record companies (or at least more than EMI in the short term). If my music files are DRM-free but still won't play on half the devices in my home, Apple and Microsoft will become the digital music bad guys. Apple doesn't need a proprietary format after building an mp3 player that overwhelmingly kicks the crap out of everything else out there.

Anyway, it's a hobble in the right direction. Don't fuck this up, Steve, and don't stop here."

"event","Several computers have come and gone over the last few years (ok, not as many of them have gone as Kaz would like). All of them have been enjoyable in their way, but none was an upgrade from the Dell desktop I bought about four years ago (five? who knows). From the $50 desktop I got from Kaz's company to the two Dell laptop hand-me-downs (thanks Kaz and skc), it didn't take long before this mound of hardware was chugging through simple tasks and repeatedly letting me know it was very tired.

So finally, after patiently waiting for a moment of financial stability, I went to the shiny Apple store and bought a shiny MacBook Pro. Damn, it's sweet. This is the first new Mac that I've owned, and it'll take some adjusting. Like everyone else, I kept trying to click by tapping the touch pad rather than the button. I'm still not sure why the home and end keys (extra bluetooth keyboard, also sweet) don't seem to do anything. But the good is far outweighing the bad (or just slightly less good) at this point. Some other bonuses:

- at long last, a huge performance upgrade
- an actual bash shell, not a barely functional putty client for windows
- expose is fun
- the apple remote is cool
- it handles a monitor a whole lot better than any windows laptop I've used
- and finally, it runs World of Warcraft like nobody's business

I'm sure there's plenty more good to come. I think I'm mostly glad that I've finally reached a point in my life where I can make a large purchase and leave myself significantly more than two dollars in the bank."

"event","I'll do you one better <lj user=""liquidbrain6502"">, I'm going to complain about our HD-DVR. We had used Tivo for a couple of years and loved it. Then we got a new TV and decided to go with HD. The HD Tivo boxes are absurdly expensive, so we went with the cheap and hopefully acceptable Comcast alternative, which is their Motorola DVR. What a piece of crap. I can't think of any other way to explain its issues--it's just a piece of crap. The fast forward and rewind are so unresponsive that they're virtually useless, the software is terrible from the interface to the features, and apparently if you use more than 80% of the storage it just sort of gives up and takes a nap. It's like having a half-assed coworker who does his work acceptably most of the time and then ends up screwing you by skipping out early on a day that you need him (maybe this is just karma).

So it sucks, and I feel like a bit of an asshole for complaining about something like this. There are far worse things to be than a mostly satisfied consumer of electronics and premium media services."

"event","Since I'm sort of a late starter with sci-fi/fantasy books, I've started making my way through the lists of <a href=""http://www.worldcon.org/hugos.html"">Hugo</a> and <a href=""http://dpsinfo.com/awardweb/nebulas/"">Nebula</a> award winning novels. These lists have some obvious classics, and a lot of not-so-obvious authors who may or may not still be in print.

Having finally read Dune for the first time, I've moved on to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Camouflage-Ace-Science-Fiction-Haldeman/dp/0441012523/sr=1-2/qid=1167919589/ref=pd_bbs_2/105-0261830-3584421?ie=UTF8&s=books""><i>Camouflage</i></a> by Joe Haldeman. I'm sure this has been done to death, but it leaves me wondering about the criteria for judging sci fi and fantasy and whether (or how much) the majority of the genres has lowered the bar rather than the classics raising it. I can't pass judgment on Mr. Haldeman just yet, but I'm at least comfortable saying this ain't Dune. I am at least making an effort not to judge any of them by the silliness of their covers.

Both lists include some clearly talented writers, but are they a minority, and have they lent credibility to an otherwise mediocre list? How about the lists themselves? Am I missing out on too many authors who are more deserving than the winners?

Don't get me wrong, I don't expect all of these books to hold their own against Moby Dick. I'll still read them and will most likely still enjoy them. The whole point of this exercise is to find more of what I like and don't like, so hopefully the majority of it will be positive."

      Heuristic, detached, and analytical to a fualt, you are most like The Oracle.  You are able to tackle any subject with a fine toothed comb, and you possess an ability to pinpoint nuances and shades of meaning that other people do not have and cannot understand.  Accomplishment and realization of ideas are, for you, secondary to the rigorous exploration of ideas and questions -- you are, first and foremost, a theorist.  You hate authority, convention, tradition, and under no circumstances do you accept a leadership role (although, you will gladly advise leadership when they're going astray, whether they want you to or not).  Abstraction and generalities are your interests, details and particulars are usually inconsequential and uninteresting.  You excel at language, mathematics and philosophy.
<br>
<br>
You are typically easy-going and non-confrontational until someone violates one of the very few principles that you deem sacred, at which point you can fly into a rage.  Although you possess a much greater understanding of process and systems than the people around you, you are always conscious of the possibility that you've missed something or made a mistake.  You don't tend to become attached to particular theories, and will immediately discard mistaken notions once they're revealed to be incorrect (but you don't tolerate iconoclasts who try to discredit validated theories through the use of fallacies and bad data).  Despite being outwardly humble, you probably think of yourself as being smarter than most other people.  That's because you are.  In fact, in your dealings with people your understanding of their motives is so expansive that you know what they're going to say before they say it, and in world affairs, you usually know what is going to take place before it actually does.  This ability would make you unbeatable in debates if only you were a little less pensive about your own conclusions, and a little more outgoing.

"event","if i call them ""errands"" and not ""shopping"" it makes the purchases sound more important and necessary. here are some finds at <a href=""http://www.sciplus.com/"">american science & surplus</a>, which i highly recommend for all your scientific and surplus needs.

- 1 lb of rubber bands
- 1 walkman that has seen better days, to be harvested for parts for the next robot project
- 2 1.5 VDC electric motors for no reason in particular
- 1 LCD display from what was probably an NEC cd player
- 2 3/8"" dowell rods for a <a href=""http://www.kennethsnelson.net/icons/struc.htm"">""tensegrity""</a> thingy from make magazine that seems to do nothing but look pretty cool
- 1 plastic travel soap container that might serve as mousebot's new case, which i guess might make it a soapbot.

all for a grand total of $11.50.

anyone happen to know of other places in the chicago area that are good for electronics scraps? AS&S is very cool, but a little small and there isn't much turnover in the inventory."

in the case pictures you can see the two holes that are cut in the case where two small electric motors will be mounted. the article i'm getting all this stuff from sort of glosses over how to get those right so the motors (and wheels) are aligned well and the bot can move in a straight line. i'm preparing for some drafting nerdness to hopefully solve the problem."

"event","more progress on mousebot today. he had a bad diode, and we all hate those, which is probably why the guinea pig mouse that has sacrificed it's usefulness as an interface device ended up in a junk drawer in my former employer's office in the first place. so yet another mouse (courtesy of the $50 PC i got from miss kaz's company) made the sacrifice and gave up its diodes so mousebot could have eyes. 

since i'm employed again i spent some money yesterday and got a pretty cool work table (sort of a craftsman heavy duty TV tray that can be folded up and put away) and a vice for holding whatever i happen to be putting the dremel to. it's a nice boost to productivity to not have to spend as much time worrying about losing a finger.

all the case preparation is pretty much done, so now it's time to start putting his brain together. i didn't really know what i was doing before, and now i really don't. luckily only 9 volts of electricity are involved, and no power tools."

"event","in the dead of winter early this year, i started accumulating parts and tools for some electronics projects. starting off with <a href=""http://www.makezine.com/images/02/mousey.pdf"">this one [pdf]</a> in particular (if you've read <a href=""http://makezine.com/"">make magazine</a> you're probably familiar with it). why? good question. i suppose if i had to make a list of things to do before i die, making a robot would probably be on there somewhere.

it didn't take long to realize that a) soldering inside an unventilated apartment wasn't going to happen, b) soldering outside wasn't going to happen since it was hovering around freezing, and c) what the hell am i doing with a soldering iron in the first place?

undaunted, i've jumped back in and resumed work on turning a mouse into a robot. for the time being, what i have is no longer a mouse and not yet a robot. things i've learned so far:

1. old mechanical mice are pretty nifty devices when you dig through one and see how it works.
2. since it took about 5 seconds of hollowing out the mouse case with a dremel for a piece of plastic shrapnel to come flying at my face, <a href=""http://www.aosafety.com/diy/eye_detail.cfm?con_prod_num=91252&con_family_id=45&con_platform_id=10"">these</a> were a wise purchase. the good people at make magazine said that plastic dust was nasty stuff, and they were right.
3. the <a href=""http://www.dremel.com/en-us/tools/tool-detail.htm?H=188091&G=66204&I=69676"">dremel</a> is a potentially evil little tool that i have what i consider a healthy respect for (read: fear of)

next steps are a little more work hollowing out the case so the new electronics will fit and cutting holes for two little electric motors to stick out. cutting these holes is a step where i'm fairly likely to screw up and destroy the whole damn thing."

"event","Since before the release of <i>Kid A</i> I've been wondering what a Yorke solo album would sound like. Now that I've had a chance to finally <a href=""http://www.theeraser.net/"">hear one</a> several times, I'm still not sure what to make of it. But it was pretty cool to come across <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=4L-xPDgDZA8&search=thom%20yorke%20clock"">this clip</a> of him doing ""The Clock"" on the Henry Rollins Show. 
<lj-cut>
One of the things I've loved about the Radiohead stuff that came after <i>OK Computer</i> has been their ability to take stuff that's been so heavily processed and that seems so dependent on electronic instrumentation and to not only translate it to a guitar or piano, but to do that and have it make sense. Behind all the bleeps and blops (and make no mistake, I'm a big fan of both) there are still Songs, maybe even one as simple as ""High and Dry"" and its three-chord progression in the old days. 

As much as I was tempted to think so at first, this album is more than Thom fiddling on his laptop during downtime with the band. Yorke's music has become a matter of process, and for whatever reason I find a little comfort in being reminded these songs could have started with an acoustic guitar just as easily as with an oscillator."

<blockquote>Astral Weeks, insofar as it can be pinned down, is a record about people stunned by life, completely overwhelmed, stalled in their skins, their ages and selves, paralyzed by the enormity of what in one moment of vision they can comprehend. It is a precious and terrible gift, born of a terrible truth, because what they see is both infinitely beautiful and terminally horrifying: the unlimited human ability to create or destroy, according to whim.</blockquote>

Things that you don't care to see
From what makes me smile
To what makes me cry
You tell me you like me
I turn my head and sigh
""What is it that you like about me?""
I so leisurely ask
""You're so cute and  really happy
and always in a good mood""
To this i just laugh
That's really not me
Just the illusion i've sold you
Just an illusion of ""me""
Only one knew what was truly there
But she looks down on me now
My ""I love you""'s don't matter anymore
I'm just a knot in her hair
'Cuz of this i've grown quite weary
And very pissy at that
""Ryan, i really like you""
All i think is 'Fuck that'
You won't take the time to get to know me
I'm just another notch on your belt
One more person of many
But i won't fall into your trap
You keep thinking you know me
Try to play me for a fucking fool
Stay the fuck outta my life
What you're doing isn't very cool
Before you try to get with me
Let me give you some advice
I'm not all about the nookie
So don't try to bribe me with that cookie
Please take the time to get no know me
Who knows what we could be?
We could take it to a higher level, see
but first, you gotta get off your knees
Just look me in the eyes
It means the world to me
I don't want the things you think i do
I would be honored to just hold you
I'm sorry i'm not who you think i am
I'm sorry that i've lied
I hope one day i'll be rid of my mask
Or to know that i have tried
One day you'll get to know me
All you gotta do love, is ask.
By: Me"

"event","Alright, i'm confused as sin as to what i'm doing relationship-wise.  I'm not quite sure where the galz i like stand on going into a relationship with me, nor am i quite sure i'm completely willing to go all out into a relationship...
Katie and i have been arguing.  I hate still liking her.  She's the main reason i haven't jumped into a relationship:  I don't want to be unfair since i feel i'd be comparing them to her (which is a nasty habit that i don't want to bring unto anyone).
So NEwhooz, i don't NEthing else to write.  I already wrote out my whole arguement i had today... which i'll post below...:
""Alright, so today in skewl i stated that i don't believe in God, and that erupted into a childish arguement between Jayne and I (no offense to you Jayne, but we were acting childish)
So i'll write my beliefs down.  Just also know that i change my beliefs on a constant basis, all depending on the circumstances that have occured, but this is the rough outline of my thoughts/beliefs...
1) i don't believe in one entity ruling over everything, nor do i believe in multiple entities ruling over anything.  I am more of a spiritual person in this aspect.  I don't deny that there is a God, i just don't believe that the way most people view God is the way it is.  I guess i'm more into Plato's theory of ""God"" than anything, but this is just a rough generalization of my views on God.
2) i don't believe in organized religion in the state it is currently in.  I am strongly secular/non-observant.  But if i were to be forced to join a religion, i would become JewBu (Judaism-Buddhism) or i'd be a Buddhist, possibly of the Zen kind.  Only reason i would become Jewish in any way shape or form is because i enjoy the Jewish culture.
3) i do what i consider is good/right.  This is the aspect of my beliefs that is constantly under construction (in a sense).  I basically follow the ""Do unto others..."" shpeal, although i can't always since i know that what i find pleasant, isn't always what others do, so there's some complications with that...
4) As far as the after-life shpeal, i don't know.  Nor do i really care.  I believe that i will/am living a (relatively) good life, so if there is a God and he is judging me, i don't quite think i'll be going to hell (in assumption there is one).  If i cease to exist, then i won't have to worry about it, now will i?
5) i don't care what other people believe in, as long as it isn't based on the hatred of others.  Like the Christian Identity movement.  I feel that this movement is giving a horrible name to Christians, and a horrible name to Human beings.  In case you don't know, the Christian Identity movement is a white-supremisist movement (Anglo-Saxon) and it uses the Christian bible as a tool to spread their hate.  They regard anyone of any other skin color as ""beasts of burden"" and therefore less than them... i find this hilarious because i do quite so believe that Jesus of Nazareth (sp?) is of Middle-Eastern decent, and therefore dark-skinned or a light brown.
6) i love cheese...mmmmmm......
Anywhooz, this is a horrible explanation as to what i believe.  The truth is, i'm in a constant state of chaos as to what to believe, so i have no set beliefs (except trying to do good/right, no matter what my definition of it is at the time).  But i would have it no other way.  I feel the only way to ""spiritual enlightenment"" is to question things and re-evaluate things rather than (in my opinion) being spoonfed others beliefs.
Plus i have a little bit of a problem with people's faith being benefit-oriented.  I don't like the thought that people are only being good because they are going to benefit from it.  I find it to be another from of human greed, but then again, greed isn't always bad, and what right do i have to judge other people's motives?... none
And blind faith.  That upsets me the most.  I just want people to think for themselves...
NEwhooz, enough bitching and complaining and offending people...
peace"""

A little further along, I stopped at Chorro Grande, which I have hiked completely now.&nbsp; This time I only hiked up far enough to check the rocks for water.&nbsp; The waterfall there is quite dry.&nbsp; Then back to the car.

I drove up to the pass the road uses and turned up the ridge road, happily open for another week.&nbsp; I dodged a few very deep potholes, once driving up the side of the cliff to do so, but everyone else was clearly doing it too.&nbsp; I dodged a lot of deep holes that didn&#39;t drop so steeply at the sides and probably weren&#39;t a danger to forward progress.&nbsp; I dodged most of the last few people on the mountain coming the other direction.&nbsp; Pine Mountain Campgroud was empty, but I was headed for Reyes Peak Campground.&nbsp; It had a couple people, but then most of them left too.&nbsp; In the evening, I spotted a couple headlamps coming up Chorro Grande who camped a little way up the road and there was one more car as well.&nbsp; There was also a lot of chairs that looked like they were just claiming a site that wasn&#39;t really occupied.

Being away from the buzz of electronics was nice, but was replaced by the moan of wind through the upper levels of the trees.&nbsp; The stove tried to get me because it wouldn&#39;t pressurize, but I made use of still having the instructions and fixed it quickly.&nbsp; I settled down on a very thick Thermarest that turned out not to be warm enough to keep the ground from sucking the heat from me, but I&#39;d brought a blue mat into the tent too to put my stuff on, so that was quickly fixed too."

"event","I was looking for a pumpkin bread recipe and find that they come in two categories: quick bread with plenty of pumpkin in it but are really cake, or risen bread that only have plenty of pumpkin if the recipe makes 3 loaves.&nbsp; In fact, all the risen breads seem determined to make more than one loaf with just a little pumpkin puree.&nbsp; I just want to toss the ingredients into the bread maker and press start, but that doesn&#39;t work for 2-3 lbs of bread.&nbsp; So I tossed together a white bread with 1 cup of pumpkin and a bit too much spice in the wrong ratio.&nbsp; I know, &quot;too much&quot; isn&#39;t something one should say, but there is a balance that must be achieved.&nbsp; It was a bit too wet and didn&#39;t rise enough and really could use a little more sweet.&nbsp; I tried with a bit of whole wheat to help take up a bit more moisture and toned down (some of) the spices and doubled the sugar, coming out with something that&#39;s very nice indeed.&nbsp; Well, maybe a little sweet now, but very gobble worthy.

1 1/3 cups white flour
2/3 cups wheat flour
4 tablespoons dried milk or buttermilk
1 tablespoon butter
3-4 tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon ginger
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon cloves
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 cup pumpkin
2 teaspoons yeast
1 tablespoon wheat gluten (optional)

Mix it all together into bread in the usual way.&nbsp; For me that means into the bread maker and hit the dough setting, which includes a 1 hour rise time after the half hour of kneading.&nbsp; I did have to add 2 tablespoons extra whole wheat to get the right moisture content still.&nbsp; Pumpkin purees will vary, so you do need to know what to expect moisture wise.&nbsp; It could probably have used a punch down and a second rise period, as is common with whole wheat breads.

For a loaf, drop the dough, punched down again and shaped, into a greased loaf pan, cover and let rise 45 minutes to 1 hour.&nbsp; Put it in the oven at 300 &deg;F for an hour, then pull it out and enjoy.&nbsp; Or let it cool, if you must.&nbsp; (These are my usual loaf baking instructions, used for the first loaf.)

For rolls, split it into 16 pieces, roll into balls and flatten.&nbsp; Place them on a greased cookie sheet and score crosswise (cut into them with a sharp knife).&nbsp; Cover and let rise for 30-45 minutes.&nbsp; Pop in the oven at 400 &deg;F for 12 minutes.&nbsp; We cooked them for on the convection setting on an insulated sheet, so it should take about the same for conventional ovens on conventional sheets.

Pumpkin purees vary.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure how ours compares to the canned sort.&nbsp; It is probably very similar.&nbsp; Ours are obtained thus: Take one carved jack-o-lantern on Nov 1st, split it and bake it, I think for about 4 hours at something in the 300 &deg;F range.&nbsp; Let cool, scoop out, dump in the blender (updated to Cuisinart), and puree.&nbsp; The resulting orange stuff gets dumped in pint containers and into the freezer until use.&nbsp; And that&#39;s why our pumpkins didn&#39;t get carved until Halloween."

"event","While at the top of the hill on my Sunday hike, I took some photos of a rather ostentatious pink castle chocked with palm trees.&nbsp; It drew the eye quite enthusiastically.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t notice at the time, but above this home was something much more understated, but still quite striking in its way.<br /><br /><img alt=""small but not cheap"" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-h2rS5RxrrcY/UI6Fwsc66KI/AAAAAAAAC40/WF2EE_2VAK0/s800/20121017_sketch_house.jpg"" /><br /><br />So this is what occupies the top of the hill.&nbsp; It may say a few things the castle says, but it just mentions them instead of screaming them."

"event","Went way down the coast to just inside Malibu, that city with quite extensive boarders, and hiked with a group in and near Leo Carrillo.&nbsp; We hiked up the Yellow Hill Fire Road, and then back down hitting a couple peaks that the road missed.&nbsp; The wind picked up as the heat grew, balancing it out a little, but leaving us quite dry at the end.<br /><br />On the way back up the coast, I stopped near Point Mugu to play with my brush pens.<br /><br /><img alt=""highway 1 wiggling along the coast at Point Mugu"" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fdZlacG4H0w/UI6Fv_nBOvI/AAAAAAAAC4c/BCjYArGcgvw/s800/20121014_sketch_coast.jpg"" /><br /><br />The new black brush pen from Kuretake is shorter and stiffer than the Pentel, but is still young enough to work nicely in the wind.&nbsp; Still, not quite as fun to use."

"event","Determined to find that pedestrian tunnel and the rest of the Sea to Backcountry trail, I stopped at the fire road and poked around a little.&nbsp; Weaving around the plants by the river, I found it and passed through.&nbsp; Beyond, there was much poison oak.&nbsp; I made my way as best I could, trying to follow trail.&nbsp; At first the trail seemed very clear, but with loads of plant to avoid all around it, some of it head height.&nbsp; It got a little less so, but I could still see cuts on the branches of the bordering bushes.&nbsp; Then it started to seem more and more like animal trail and quickly I was forced to just push through the easiest place.&nbsp; I made my way toward a hill that had seemed to have trail on it in the satellite photos and would be much easier to travel on since it was just dry grass.&nbsp; I made my way up, turning onto a bit that looked like trail cut, but as soon as it was out to where it was flat, no cutting had been required and the trail vanished again.&nbsp; I made my way upward to where there should be trail, then seeing all sorts of poison oak up the hill, decided to just follow the grasslands toward the traditional starting point.&nbsp; I passed a windbreak someone had built of stones and soon bumped into trail.&nbsp; I continued along it the same direction to fire road, then turned up it.&nbsp; Fire road turns into trail, possibly at the forest boundary.&nbsp; Trail branches and does funny things at a saddle and I skipped a small section of it.&nbsp; I saw below someone had put a &quot;no trespassing&quot; sign along trail that continued down the canyon on the other side of the saddle.&nbsp; I continued up and found the backside of another.&nbsp; Maybe someone thinks it&#39;s funny on Trespass Trail?&nbsp; Isn&#39;t that name historical?&nbsp; I continued to the top.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, and it rained.&nbsp; A lot while I ate, but my sun hat turns easily to a rain hat by simply remaining on my head.&nbsp; It was finishing as I left the peak, but I should have waited just a little longer for some good clearing.&nbsp; Ah well.<br /><br />Then I went down for what seemed much more than I&#39;d climbed.&nbsp; I spotted a trail to the side and followed it past one spring that was being collected only to pour out a pipe with holes in it.&nbsp; This spring isn&#39;t actually hot even though it has some of the same white grime I saw in Lassen around it.&nbsp; I took a photo of the water spouting out the holes in the pipe, and then, slowly, fewer and fewer spouted.&nbsp; The housing of the spring was quite noisy, but I couldn&#39;t look inside to see what was making the racket.&nbsp; Back to the trail, I followed it to a dry canyon, then took a trail that had branched off downward.&nbsp; A bit of smell and noise made it clear I&#39;d got to the hot spring.&nbsp; I felt the water in the pools, but it wasn&#39;t very warm.&nbsp; I remember the runoff at the fire road being warmer when I passed before.&nbsp; I was expecting the pools to be quite hot.<br /><br /><img gaviota="""" hot="""" not="""" so="""" src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lTAOpFIRZSU/UHehNft4hDI/AAAAAAAAC3o/Mnvs4eT8oe0/s800/20121011_sketch_water.jpg"" /><br /><br />I headed down and found that the trail I&#39;d come in on had been very close to the junction of the fire roads.&nbsp; I followed it back, to a sign just past where I&#39;d joined it that indicated a junction with a trail going up the hill and looked for such again, but didn&#39;t find it.&nbsp; A little further, I did find a junction and followed the trail a little way in the direction that wasn&#39;t mine, but it just seemed to want to climb.&nbsp; Along the trail above, there had been another sign indicating a junction that had a trail going down, so these may meet.&nbsp; I turned back and made my way down again, this time looking to get down to the freeway as much by the grasslands as possible, then follow it back to the pedestrian underpass.&nbsp; It worked well until I bumped into an old bit of fence.&nbsp; I followed it down, coming to bushes I had to push through, but others probably had been this way.&nbsp; Just short of a gate that would never open for me, the barbed wire was loose and the rest of the way to the roadway looked like an easy walk, so I climbed through.&nbsp; I was only a little way from the underpass, and popped under to the car again.<br /><br />And it was cleaner than when I left it.&nbsp; Imagine that?&nbsp; Parking next to a gravel road and the car is cleaner."

I got off one photo and used it for reference here.&nbsp; Wonder why they all wear such big waders.&nbsp; Maybe it makes more sense when the ocean isn&#39;t so flat."

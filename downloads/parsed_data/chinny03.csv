"event","I was expecting a disappointing weekend but it didn't turn out that bad.  Friday everyone went to the bars or went home for the weekeend so it left me and Chris at my house.  I decided to go to my friends house and there were a few people there.  It was a lot better than hanging out at my house.  Then on Saturday I had to have an interview and meetings and crap like that until 8 or 9.  I was so bummed everything lasted that late because I was going to tailgate at the football game.  So I just pregamed at my house as usual.  There was a little party going on behind my house so we all stopped over there before going to another party.  The party we went to wasn't bad.  I didn't think it would get busted up because no one was in the streets and no trouble was being caused.  I was wrong.  The cops came one time and didn't bust it up.  They were their for a while, but I just stayed and drank beer.  After the cops left so many people came back.  Bout an hour later the place was flooded with cops.  People started chanting ""Michigan sucks"" and a bunch of football cheers that pissed the cops off.  The last time I saw this many cops was when their was a huge ass fight at a party.  I passed all the cops finally then when I was almost home one passes me really slowly and scared the shit outta me.  I was drunk, but I was minding my own business walking straight with nothing on me.  So when he turned down my street and got outta view I crossed the street and went by the house that was having the first party we went to.  Then I just cocntinued to walk through the back yard to my house.  Very scary moment.  Then Joe calls me and says he is lost and doesn't know where he is at. So after an hour of trying to find where he is at my neighbor and I went to go find him.  He was so drunk that he fell on the sidewalk.  Now he has a big mark on his head.  He just says he got in a fight which I think is pretty funny.  That is about it for the weekend.  It could have been a lot better and could have been a lot worse."

"event","I haven't updated this in a while because I moved into my house in Akron and we didn't get the Intrenet until this Sunday.  It was good to have a week off from work so I could relax before school started.  I can definately say I got caught up on my partying that week.  First week of school wasn't too bad.  Of course the classes sucked, but on the other hand it was nice to see all the new stuff we got on campus.  The campus looks a lot better than it did last year.  

I have a good feeling about this year.  I know people this year that I can hang out with unlike last year where I was still meeting people.  Almost everynight someone is over at my house hanging out.  Tuesday I waken up by Deisz going through my hall yelling ""Slow motion"" I really didn't mind it made me laugh, and I didn't have to wake up untitl like 11 that day.  That's what I like about my schedule.  Thursday night came around and we were pregaming at my house and all of a sudden everyone left to go to a party on Nash.  I didn't wanna walk there when I was drunk so I just chilled with Joe and Chris.  Then Shawn said he wanted to go to the party so we went.  Good thing I did.  It was a good time.  I got to see a bunch of people that I haven't seen all summer.  Friday sucked for me I didn't go to any parties just chilled at my house.  Then Saturday came.  Saturday was a good time.  Dan from down the street threw an 8 kegger.  We did the usual and pregamed at the house and then walked down the street.  There was so many people at that party.  I got to see more people I haven't got to see for a long time.  For some reason I kept running from my house and back to the party.  The next day Joe was tellin me all this stuff that I was doing but I don't remember any of it.  Sunday was a let down for me.  Shawn almost got in a fight for yelling at a girl to take off her shirt.  So a bunch of us stopped that.  He was out of it.  Him and Brad were playing Mario Cart with the loser taking shots and they ended up killing a bottle and a half in less than an hour.  I went to the party on Carroll but I didn't know anyone.  It was a good size party to.  It was like 4 houses in a row threw a party.  Then I come home and smelled something burning.  The oven was on and a piece of my garlic bread was completely black.  I'm surprised the house didn't burn down.  It was an eventful weekend.  Well I'm out for now."

"event","Finally, tomorrow is my last day of work.  Unfortunately it will be a long one.I have gotten to know a lot of cool people from work this summer.  I can't wait to move into my house on Tuesday.  I can finally hang out with my friends again, and not have to work.  Even though they want me to manage a Pizza Hut while I'm at school.  Their is no way it is going to happen.  I can't work 35+ hours a week, go to school, get good grades, and have a social life.  On top of that, they want me to be able to deliver pizzas.  I am definately not delivering pizzas in Akron because of safety reasons.  Who knows what I'll end up doing.  I need to work to pay for bills, but I really need a break.  I've been busting my ass all summer and have had no social life.  I'm going to end up working my ass off all through college and not have any fun.  These are supposed to be the best years of my life and so far they have sucked.  Well anyways... I didn't do too much today.  I got up and attempted to pack my shit.  I still have a lot left to do but I have no time because I am always working.  Then today at work this guy that works with me was tellin me bout how he used to do all these drugs when he was younger.    Then ten minutes later he was telling me about how his girlfriend hates it when he starts doing her when she is sleeping.  This guy cracks me up at work with all of his stories.  Well I'm tired so I'm done writing for the night."

"event","4 more days of work left I'm so excited.  It's gonna be the longest 4 days ever.  I won't have time to pack and get ready to move.  I can't wait to get back to school.  I don't wanna go to class.  I just wanna hang out and party with my friends.  I haven't had much fun this summer at all.  I wonder who commented on my post as Anonymous.  I'm always up for partying especiallly with girls.  Too bad I don't know who you are lol.  Not much else has gone on lately.  I bought Tony Hawk's Underground.  It is a pretty sweet game, but I haven't played it a lot since I've been working.  Well I'm done writing for the night.  Peace out."

"event","I'm on my final stretch of working this summer.  Only 8 more days in a row I have to work without a day off.  It leaves me with no time to pack and getting ready for when I move into my house in Akron.  Last night we threw a party at my house in Akron.  I had a decent time.  Was bummed that a bunch of people didn't come.  But it will probablly be better when school starts anyways.  Anyways, I got off work on Friday and drove down to Akron and just chilled and watched movies.  Then Witt comes stumbling in drunk as hell and goes to the TV and grabs a big stack of DVD's and says he is gonna watch all of them.  It was funny watch him stumble around.  After the movie I just went to bed.  I was awakened by construction workers outside our house at 8AM.  They were cementing some shit behind our house.  Later on in the day Bhagyesh decided to write ""Brad is gay 4ever"" and ""I love hos"" on the cement.  So I just chilled and watched movies and played X Box.  Around 10 I had to wake Witt and Brad up to see where we were going to get our keg at for the party.  We hurried to figure everything out because you couldn't get kegs past noon on Saturdays.  The only place we knew of was this brewery in Waco.  So I drove like 40 minutes each way to pick the keg up.  The whole ride back the keg was rolling around in my car.  The rest of the day we just chilled and did nothing.  The party wasn't big at all which is good because I didn't want the cops to come.  But it would have been nice to have a few more people.  I had a decent time.  These old black dudes showed up at our house and kicked it with us.  I find it funny in a way, but on the other hand I don't want some 40 year old black dude kickin it with us.  Our neighbor came over and slammed a few beers with us.  He is pretty cool.  Deisz came over with 2 bottles of Red Label.  Hanging out with Diesz is always a blast.  You get to hear of all the stupid but funny shit he says and does.  Everyone got to hear about his ""experiences"" in Cancun.  Wow I'm writing a lot of shit down that no ones cares about lol.  If you wanna know more about the party just come talk to me, but I'm outta here for the night I'm tired as hell.  Peace out."

"event","OK. So I finally got one of these after I kept on reading everyone elses.  I am bored so I'm like what the hell.  I'm not a very good writer so I might write some things that make no sense or are in fragments and jump around a lot.  Just thought I would let you all know that.  Anyways, work sucked as usual.  I can't wait to leave work, but the bad thing is I might get transferred because I need a job during school.  So if I do get transferred I'm letting them know I am not working on Friday or Saturday nights because I have better things to do if you know what I mean.  So I was at work today and the RGM, Mike told me Keith or I had to be at the store tomorrow morning to open it because he might not be there.  He said he has interviews or some shit to do in Chesterland.  So Keith lives in Euclid and would be really pissed off if I called him up and asked him if he could open the store.  So I took one for the team and have to open the store tomorrow.  Better yet, I open the store, leave when Mike gets there, and go home or go somewhere, then go back and work a 4-close shift.  I hate it.  I also hate being the bad guy at work.  If you didn't know I'm the assistant manager at Pizza Hut.  I hate telling people what to do.  So I tell them in a nice way, but lately people aren't doing what I told them to do or it takes them 3 hours to do it.  They wonder why I get mad at them.  Anyways, I can't wait until Saturday.  I'm gonna try to move some of my stuff into my new house in Akron.  To top it off I guess we are having a party/get together.  I'm not sure how big it is going to be but it will be fun because all I've done this summer is worked.  I haven't gotten to hang out with any of my friends.  Plus, there isn't really a lot to do in Hartsgrove.  So if anyone wants to hang out some time gimme a call lol I'd love to hang out with you.  All I do is work, sleep, and wake up and go back to work again.  Well that's enough of me writing tonight.  I gotta work in a few hours anyways."

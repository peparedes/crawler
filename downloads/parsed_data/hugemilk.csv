"event","well, I did not do much today except the dishes and read my book, Dragons of Autumn Twilight(which is the book I am getting Margie to read).  I might not get the cow tattoo, cuz it might not be something I want 1o yrs down the road( u were right).
 And I get my BMX trick bike this weekend, so I am stoked about that.  The first tricks I wanna learn are: 180, bunnyhop, and Endo. those wll be my first and hopefully more will follow.

I was a total fucking jerk to Margie last night.  I guess I was jealous of her having a certain friend.....but I am over that now.  She can have all the friends she desires, becasue I know that she is my girlfriend...my better half if you will.  So, margie, if you are reading this(which i know you will be), I am so sorry.  

Love you,

For breakfast all I had was a some Hershey's Kisses, and some Tootise Rolls, not much but I did not want to cook.  Yesterday tho, I made some kinda cool hotdog-hash brown concotion.; it was shibby.  

I actually have a plan for my summer vacation next year.  After, I am done with my first year of college, I am getting a buddy and am going to travel, the whole summer.  Right now on my agenda is Oregon, New Jersey, Nevada, Utah, Missouri, Edmonton, Albera, and other places.  I listed those names becaus eI have friends in those states.

I am talking to Mar-G, right now, she got back form work not too long ago.  She picks flowers and does stuff with them.  We talked for like, 2 hours on the phone and online, so it was a good ending to a good day.

"event","Me jealous of Frank and Rhihana?  Alright, I admit it.....I am not jealous of their relationship.  I don't really care what they do, it is their life as long as they don't do stuff at my house( u guys know what I mean).  They are good for each other, and I was just letting Rhihana know that Frank did say I love you, but she said it first, so I thought he should not have said it back.  But he USED to always hug her.   I really have nothing to be jealous about.  

Sorry, Rhihana and Frank"

I mean, I DID get off fast, but I had to right then, but only cuz my mom made me go with her to the store,  so I could not say bye.  So, if she reads this later, I am sorry, if I made her mad. 

I talked to Kyle today, and I was depressed because I have not seen him in so long, and I want to see him, since we have known each other for 13 yrs.  I don't know how to invite him down here or ask if I could come visit him.  

I am reading a book called Dragons of Fallen Sun.  It is part of the Dragonlance saga.  I really like fantasy books, but I used to like sci-fi also; but just now read fantasy. Dragonlance is the best, but anything by Piers Anthony, Davied Eddings, David Gemmel, or Terry Brooks is good.

I get my haircut tomorrow.  I don't know what I will get, but I usually get it short and spikey, so I don't know what I will do now.  My mom and dad my go appartment hunting while I am at the library.  

Speaking of my dad, he works in glass, and I asked him to talk to his boss, since there only 3 people that work at this glass shop, if I could work there.  He said he will talk to him.  My dad his been working in glass for like 17 yrs. now.

I was online last night talking to Margie, for like, ever(which was cool).  Ever since our little break up and we got back together we have found out more about each other, and have found more to talk about.  Except yesterday I think I overstepped my boundries a little.  I was just talking about her friends, which are mostly stoners.  I don't do that and neither does she, so I asked why she hung out with them, and she said they were here best friends.  So, I was a little out of line.

Not much happened today, and I am not really doing anything today to celebrate the 4th of July.  I am kinda bummed cuz my cousin did not invite me over to do anything, but it is ok, it is not like we are the best of friends or anything.
 On the 7th, it is my friend Kyle's birthday.  We have known each other for about 13 yrs. now.  When I moved to Silver Springs, Nevada he was the first person to come over to my house and introdce himself to me.  Oh, BTW, how many of you have ever been to Silver Springs or heard of it?  I know at least one other person, that did not live there who has heard of it.
 I go back to the library tomorrow, and I will see if I can stay out of the line of fire and don't get into trouble lol.

I could go to her with any problem, big or small, and not worry what she will say, cuz she will be honest with me no matter what.  At the end of the world, I would want to be with 5 people, Margie would top my list(the other 4 being my mom, my dad, grandma, and grandpa).  
 Also, if I am troubled, just knowing Marie is there, is enough to make me happy.  Just to hear her voice, it make my heart sing.

"event","Hi, me again. Well, today I had an ass-day(sucky, shitty day).  I got kicked out of the library where I work/volunteer.  Cuz, Margie(a worker there, NOT my g/f), decided that I was disrupting the other volunteers, which I was not.   So, I left, but I work/volunteer on Thursday and Friday. I got in trouble cuz I was not scheduled today, but I was working anyway.  Well, Frank works Thursday also, and he is not scheduled either, so  If he does not get talked to by Margie, then I will know that she has a personel vendetta against me.
 Speaking of Margie, I talked to my girlfriend, Margie(aka Butters) today so that made me feel a WHOLE lot better; like she always does :)  I don't know what it is about her, but she always makes me feel better.  I love her sooooooooo much.  She is my whole world.

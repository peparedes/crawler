"event","I know you all wanted me to update so here i am...hah.
so i also know that you are all interested in what has been new with me as well.

so i have been trying to get a job over the summer to no sucess so far...anyone w/ connections feel free to let the desperate child know :)
hah
............................................

i have been helping people with their dating problems which is so ironic. Kevin and Alex drive each other insane, Nick ignores and doesnt do stuff with Ashli, and now, Megan DeBoer has been asking me for advice on how she should deal with her boyfriend, alex keller. i just find this so ironic...i can help everyone else but yet look where i am. especially when megan is like ""oooh well you sure know how to deal w/ girls well""...or dont i? oh well
...blah..
while on the subject, my attempt to start a friendship with you-know-who (i think only alyssa, kitty, and ashli know...im not sure tho). it resulted in her thinking that i am weird and shit like that. i was so mad...(alyssa we have to go dump some trash). its like, ""ohh blab blah blabbity...i like everybody. i am not a mean person. blob blop bloop..."" 
ugh...
what a bitch

i cannot wait until summer...even tho i will seriously miss some of my friends who are going away to college, the summer will be a blast. i am going to see Panic! at the disco on july 14, camp for a week, and then to chicago for a week and a half to two weeks to stay w/ my cousin. i won't see my cousins from florida this summer which is hard. its been over two years since i've last seen them and i hate it that they live so far away. my mom said that we can go visit them over thanksgiving or christmas, which will be cool, especially cause that means one less holiday w/ the marini's and a holiday w/ the schmidt's....suh-weeeeet...

speaking of relatives, my grandma is moving on May 30th to her new appartment out on M-59 and Van Dyke (hahah dyke...). it sucks...she'll be so far away from us and the only reason she is moving is to get closer to my stupid aunt who tends to get in arguements with my mom a lot. its gonna be a serious cut down on time i get to see with my grandma. she's my only grandparent left and shes 86 so i wanna spend as much time with her as i possibly can.
__________________________________________________________________________________

ashli, nick, alex, and kevin are all going to ashli's cottage over memorial day and i am not...thanks guys, way to not only not invite me, but to totally include me. bleh. whatever


note: i suggest you all see the movie ""crash""...its the one that won best picture at the academy awards and it is phenomonal (sp?). even tho its really sad, its amazing.

another note: rachael ray has made Time Magazine's list of 100 Most Influential people...wow i love that lady

i kinda wanna know if this is still worth updating anymore...lemme know if u read it"

"event","How far does it go to be mean to someone? i am probably the biggest hypocrite out there. i hate it when people are mean but yet i am really mean to this one kid at school and people have said stuff to me about it. the worst thing is, i have no sympathy whatsoever. does that make me a bad person? i have a personal vandetta against him that makes my wrath against him seem to grow. its like drugs...
i can stop it, not stop being mean...wow...when did i ever thing i would come to this?
what do i do?
he invites me to a ""party"" and i mysteriously get plans
he sends me mail and i'm afriad to open it just because its from him...
i have made one of my best friends kick him out of our group for new york or i told him i would be mad at him for not doing it...
i guess i need help
i dont hate people, really...i love people
just not him...
answers for the confused?
and yes a public entry"

"event","Well, i survived MORP! it was a lot of fun if you were there. i had so much fun. we pranked danielle with the creepy lesbian girl and that was a priceless moment! MORP friends, remember the two OTHER lesbians?? eww...lol. cassie and kelli were so fun to be around and danielle was boring ignorant and rude like usual. so what did i expect? which brings me to another point. she needs to seriously think about how she treats other people. she looked like she wasnt having fun at the dance, she is such a martyr. why did she even come then?? for example, i was walking and talking to kelli and she just walks right in between us and starts talking to kelli. it's like hello! i was here too! just because you're so uptight doesnt mean you have to be an asshole about it! sheesh! also, after school today, i was going to tell her about how mcmillian was teasing her again so cassie's like ""oh danielle!!! tommy has something to tell you!"" (which is akward but w/e) so she replies ""ya, sure he does..i really have to go to the bathroom? cassie will you come with me?"" i mean how rude!!! i dont know why she acts so mean to people but...oh...idk it's wierd. i want to talk to her about it and how i feel used, but is it really worth it? i think that if i continue talking about her i will get even more upset!! hey...look a quarter!"

"event","Well...here i am...I was convinced to make one of these things so don't complain. I am probably not the type of person who sits here all day going on and on about a crush or something. But if its someone who pisses me off...you should expect it ;). Well let's first start off by saying that today my mom had surgery and it's hell. Not because she survived, but because it's everyone wait on her at her discretion. Oh...you have no idea. I probably bombed my chair test today but thats ok. UGH! It's not! he's such an asshole. I have a life outside of pep band and for some goddamn reason, he just doesnt seem to get it. Go figure huh? and now my driving has been delayed because of the shitty thing!!! WTF?! Some people have been totally rude to me lately. It's so annoying! It's like, fine you dont have to talk to me, but to talk and be so rude! Don't expcet me to be all ""peachy"" about it either. I'm going to give u hell...honestly. But obviously you just dont get it. Why is it half the time i loan people money they never pay back...ok im done

what a terrible mistake you were, both times. i wish i felt nothing for you and had never met you. you are all wrinkled around your eyes. you have bad breath and a worse temper. your teeth are messed up and your eyes bulge out. you embarrass yourself trying to be a two bit town hipster. i hope your relationship fizzles and you are left all alone. 

i am a bad person.

"event","i have actually been really happy to date, with a few minor setbacks like fearing grad school and wondering if mfs hated my guts. also, you shouldn't be reading this see, so if you do and see things you don't like, it's your own fault.

i imed him because i can't stop having nightmares about mfs hating me. i asked him flat out if he did and he said no. and it made me feel a lot better. he wrote: it just hurts a little. which is surprising, because i didn't think he cared. i mean, i hurt really bad towards the end of the summer and start of school but i'm actually over it. and i know a lot of that has to do with finding someone who matches me a lot better, and who treats me the way that i want to be treated, and has so much in common with me.. so i guess what i'm saying is that i've been lucky. really lucky. 

i've been having nightmares about mt too. about hurting him and causing him pain. i never wanted to do that, it still doesn't make sense to me exactly that we aren't together, which is something i can not explain to anyone, nor will i try. i guess it's just that 3 years is a long time and i was used to seeing him every day. and now that i've said certain things i never thought i'd say to a person besides him, well, i guess that's thrown me off course. becuase i really truly mean it and it scares me. and i still feel things for mt, i know i love him.. but i'm not clear on what those things and i dont want anyone hurt or offended. because i really care about see, and i'm so happy that he feels the same way. i just need time i guess and that's something i haven't had. 

whatever, hopefully the nightmares will subside. at least the mfs ones should.i feel bad that he's ""hurt"", but i really can't take responsibility for that one so i have a clear conscience."

the thing is, i find myself thinking about other guys. even the one that is mean to me sometimes. the kid is just too controlling and can act like a real baby if things aren't going his way. he makes me laugh but he also made me cry a few times. m never really made me cry from being nasty. but i don't want to kiss him. at all really.

this class has been pretty crappy this summer and i think i'm going to do horrid on the final tomorrow. and i don't even care. i feel nothing towards it. i feel like a shell again and all i do is eat and suck up entertainment like comics and tv and books. if i'm not distracted i feel pretty sad and empty i guess. i think i can't figure out why i'm not attracted to m because i can't even be honest with myself about certain things. or tell him some things i've kept from him.

my sister's friend is dead. he was 17 and a routine heroine user. he committed suicide by oding on purpose. just the thought makes me sick and i can't imagine how a 15 year old can be handling that. it makes me want to vomit. i think when he did it he was on the phone with his boyfriend, a kid i know who is sweet and funny. it brings back memories that make me shutter to think how stupid i was and how half hearted things were and i wonder how fully this kid really wanted to die. if he really thought about how permanent it would be.. instead he left everyone thinking it instead.

things are stagnant right now and i'm unhappy but we all go through times like this. i try to fill up time with things but thoughts are nagging and i hate to be this way. i'm not supposed to be this way. i don't like how things turned out with j, and the whole ""liking me"" situation. now mt knows and is fully aware of what happened and i can't even tell if that is good or bad.. i just know it was hard not to tell him and i hope i don't regret him knowing. 

i just want things to work out for me. i guess everyone's that way but it sounds pretty selfish when i write it down here. i mean look at that kid's family and friends. they have it much worse than i do right now.. and yet i'm sitting here being self centered as usual. i guess it doesn't matter"

i'm 21. i want to see what else is out there. that sounds horrible. i don't know what to do. i love him so much, i really do. but i'm not attracted to his body anymore.. he sorta stopped taking care of it after we were together for like 6 months. i'm sick of the stuff he does. he says he is sorry for taking me for granted but it feels like he didn't even notice until someone told him that. someone suggested we go on a ""date"" this weekend and that just sounds awkward and horrible. i feel awkward and horrible. 

i have feelings for other people. and mostly for one person in particular and that is wrong. why am i looking around? that means something isn't right in the relationship. it's not us taking care of each other anymore. it's either me taking care of him and being resentful, or him being upset that i am angry with him. we have fun still sometimes but it's all a repeat. and maybe that's how it is with everyone and relationships should be limited to only 3 months out of a year. i couldn't say. what i can say is this: i just want to know what to do so i can do it."

and it sounds terrible. like we've almost hit three years and i just want to cuddle. i just want to get drunk and play spin the bottle so i can innocently kiss other boys that i have always wanted to kiss. i don't want to break up. nothing would tear my heart out of my chest worse than that. i don't want to date other people but i'm so fucking curious sometimes. i've never had another person like him. the one boy who wanted to be with me in high school lived in ohio and it just didn't work out. i think the furthest i got with him was 2nd base (if i even have those correct inside my head..) and that was that. i was 16 then. and inbetween then no one else really wanted to be my boyfriend, except one creepy kid i had to avoid like the plague. and then there was the boy i have now.

we had sex within the first 10 days of ""going out"" and it wasn't a mistake. nothing has really been a mistake between us in these 3 years. but i'm so confused. why don't i want to sleep with him anymore? i was excited.. excited he was leaving today because he's been staying at my dorm all week and i feel so terrible about it. so terrible to put that into words. but i guess i have to say something or i'll go insane. do i love him? yes, of course. but i don't fucking know what to do and i just hope that i want to have sex again eventually and that i stop thinking about what it would be like to see other people. because let's face it.. when people take breaks from each other to ""see other people"" they do not tend to get back together. and this is all making my stomach turn badly inside out.

i'm proud of myself. it took a lot to get to where i am now- taking a full load of courses, actually making friends, going to club meetings, not being afraid to step outside of my room to do things most people can take for granted. i guess what i'm saying is i want to say to all of you what i couldn't say to those other kids: please don't do anything rash. things may not get better for a really long time but they will. the year i almost gave up my father lost his business and was suicidal, my mom was afraid we were going to lose our home, i watched the world trade center fall down less than a mile away while people i knew were inside, and a variety of other things i don't want to go into. but i'm so glad i lived through it because things are okay now."

of course this is a terrible day- my family lost 2 people we knew and my boyfriend lost someone he knew since he was a little kid. but i don't think it's a good idea to just lay in bed all day because that probably wouldn't do anything good.

i've been feeling a little afraid in some of my classes w/social anxiety but i'm doing the best i can and i think that's good enough. i think zoloft is actually working (or maybe it's the klonopin?) because i was able to get a babysitting job and i've actually made a few new friends, which is very hard for me. i'm also able to go to shows, which is a very good sign for me. i just hope nothing terrible happens anytime soon that could throw me off course. i just want to stay really focused and just get through another year."

i don't want to see it as giving up. i mean, it took at lot for me to say i needed a doctor and a lot to get one considering i'm scared shitless of them at this point since i know they can mess up.. if i can just get through these next two weeks things could be peachy. i know it. i know i just have to give these oral presenations and sit through these classes a few more times before i don't have to anymore.. and take a few difficult exams. even if i don't do the best, i can just try my hardest. it's hard to concentrate but i'm trying. i feel like i'm crying less. which is always a plus.

i get worried about stuff with my boyfriend sometimes.. like that he'll grow tired of me. but i think it's just that i'm worried about everything and when that happens i think about the worst possible situations for all things.

my stomach is so nervous that it always feels like it's going to explode. why should every little thing be so hard? i just want to be laid back and cool. and calm. and collected. have times where my mind just is blank and other times when it can focus to important things. but instead it seems to just drift along the same patterns every day.. i'm scared. i'm worried. i'm a goddamn baby. shut up, leave yourself alone. no, grow the fuck up. deal with it. but i'm scared i'm scared i'm scared.  

i hate this. i want to be thankful and glad and feel safe. i want to feel purpose to my life. and reasons to keep going. but sometimes i can't see them. i can't see why i'm doing the things i'm doing or why i'm trying to make it through. i guess for me it feels like if you don't have anything to love then nothing is worth it anyway. i love mike and my mom and dad. my siblings too, even though they really don't like me very much at all. and one seems to think i'd be better off dead. maybe that's adolescence talking. i can't seem to have conversations with people. or feel intersting. or interested. i think i'm starting to get sad because i feel isolated and i know other people feel bad too and are afraid of social things and are afraid to go outside but i never talk to them. i know they exist but i can't see them so it doesn't help. i want to see them just to feel better. maybe i'll try to talk to the counselor at my school? i just don't want to fuck up. i don't want to ever hurt myself again and i don't want to hurt inside either. i want control but i guess people don't have too much of that anyway. 

honestly, i just feel like sleeping always and i know that is probably not a good sign."

"event","why do i have to be afraid of nothing? it's embarrassing to be scared to go outside and even if nobody knows.. i know. and i'm tired of it. i'm tired of feeling like an idiot who is scared to do things everyone else seems to do fine. i'm afraid to be alone. i'm so scared for mt to leave this school because it's like i'll be here all alone; i seem to feel more and more alone as the days pass just because i'm not able to talk to anyone. i don't try very hard to do so because it feels like my heart is going to punch a hole through my stupid chest. i don't want to be afraid to do things and to live my life. but it seems like i can't get away from that feeling. it always comes back when things are 'going well'. i'm away from my family. i'm not having migraines or feeling sick anymore. but it's like i always want something to worry about; i can't just live.. i have to sit back and be afraid of every moment. afraid of every person; that they're going to hurt me even if i don't know them. that something crazy is going to happen. like vehicles blowing up when i'm inside or buildings getting bombed. i have trouble going to the fucking meal hall to eat because i'm so afraid. i'm tired of being this way. and i can't seem to figure out how to fix it.

the doctor says medicine. but if i look at the past that didn't seem to work. or did it? is it the reason i was able to talk to mt? i really am not sure. i hate being afraid of teachers and other students who don't care about me or notice me in the least. i want to have it together. i want to do well. i don't want to be a baby about things and wish for my mom to save me everytime i'm scared. or for my dad to tell me what to do. i don't want to cry about this and sit in a chair shaking like a loser. cry about mistakes i'm probably making for my future. thinking already that i'll be unhappy no matter what- that can't be the right way to live. i'm just sick sick sick sick of it. sick of me. i want to like myself and take care of myself.. do all the things the other people seem to do. i want to call them kids. i want to be a kid. am i? i'm 20 and i don't know. i feel like i'm 10 and alone, lost in a dark parking lot. crying for someone to help me but scared of them too. i think i'm an idiot.

what if medicine just makes me tired and lazy and unable to work right? or changes my personality? or makes me worse. i don't want to be scared of people my own age. i even feel worried around little kids now.. and adults. it's just like i'm bad in every direction. i don't want to be a failure. or to feel like one, even if i'm not failing. i just want to cope and not be so goddamn needy because maybe that will push the one person i love more than anything away from me. who wants to wake up next to someone who is crying all of the time? or get a million frantic phonecalls about simple things no one else worries about. i just don't want him to wake up sometime and think: ""wow, she isn't really worth it"", i don't want him to get tired of putting up with things. he says he doesn't. maybe that's part of love, you put up with the bad because you remember the good. or you don't mind the bad you just wnat to help? i do'nt fucking know. i just don't want to destroy the good things in my life that are keeping me going."

it's dumb. i have these tests and i'm so fucking scared for them but having a hard time actually trying to get myself to study because all the words seem to mush together when i'm reading. when i think i'm stupid and can't do something that is what seems to happen.. i can't. i feel like the biggest asshole for taking a test in the center instead of in this class i can't breath in. i feel like a cheater/liar/thief just because maybe i was or am those things. i can't seem to say it's okay to take a test in a quieter area with less noise and more time. it feels like cheating, even if you are with the disability center and they are the ones that said it's okay. 

i feel scared about everything. because maybe i don't want to act like an adult and fix my own messes i make.. and i'm trying but i get really overwhelmed and i think i'm looking at life the wrong way or something.. because i've been unhappy. and it seems like when i am with the things that make me happy, for example spending time with m. all i can seem to do is want to cry to him and make him hold me.. like i'm this baby that just can't cope with taking care of myself. i like that we help take care of each other. i love it. but i'm also scared because he's going off to grad school and i'll still be here. i'm scared i won't really like my major after all. 

i'm scared maybe i don't love kids even though i always have. that maybe it went away. that maybe i'm doing all the wrong things and choosing the wrong things and this is why i don't like making decisions. i'm bad at it. i'm indecisive. and i take responsiblity but i don't like to because it seems like i've always had to. with things even when i was little that you aren't supposed to take responsibility for and now i just suck at it.

basically i'm scared out of my mind. and i'm afraid i'm wasting a ton of money at this school even though i wanted to go here.. now i feel really dumb about how much it costs. 

i need to get some self esteem back cause i think it's gone right now.. and if i could just tell myself again that i don't care what other people think and that i just want to get through things i'd be a lot better but i can't. instead i always tell myself i'm wrong about everything and stupid and ugly and not fun to be near and just annoying to those around me. i hate that feeling. i hate feeling like nothing because when i felt like nothing last year around this time i did terrible things to myself. and i don't want to ever again. 

i don't know. it feels like nothing is wrong and i'm complaining and at the same time everything is wrong."

it scares me that people can see everything on your computer even when there is  nothing to see. it scares me that spy ware even exists and that's nothing. it scares me when i go outside and someone makes the wrong face at me. it scares me when someone finds something out they aren't or weren't supposed to know. and that maybe i even told them. it scares me when i try to volunteer an answer because then i think i'm stupid. it scares me to use the wrong syntax/semantics. it scares me to look wrong. it scares me to be wrong ever. and so i try to do it to test myself maybe.

and i also over think everything. make up  meanings that may or may not exist. i hate trigger things but i like to read them. i want to know what other people did. i want to always help everyone but you can't. and i want to help myself and i'm terrible at it but i'm trying harder than ever.

i've always been the quiet person who was kind of weird and sick feeling who thought she was insane. i've always been the dork. or the person trying to attract attention when they've never had it. or the person who wants to give the answer so badly but can't. or the person who tries and fails miserably. 

i do things well. i can paint and draw okay. i take pretty pictures. i make nice things. i love someone. and somethings. i love people but they make me sad. i like hamsters. and cats. and lots of dogs. and birds a lot. i like my mom. i like my dad. i feel bad for them both. i feel bad for the whole world but you can't. not everyone cause you get really sick and crazy. when you think of each person. what are they going through? what are they doing right now? why? what do they think of me? did they see me? why did i make that face? i mean i can't do it. i can't live like that anymore every second.

i know we all do it. but i take it to weird extremes. like obsessing over nonexistant things. and getting weird. and i'm not so weird. i met kids in the hospital that thought i went to their school but then thought i was someone else but then insisted we did this or that. i met alcoholics and drug addicts. i mean i met them all. i didn't learn all of their stories. of course not. but i met them.

and i saw the people once in another country. they had nothing almost. i mean materially. but they seemed a lot happier in some ways. i think a lot smoked pot. but also no one got mad when you got stuck behind a cow or a person in a car. and they'd give each other rides w/out knowing one another. nothing was buzzing. i never heard a cell p. go off. i fixed a toilet. we got to use it. they had blue water. it was pretty. they played in it. the kids had toys and played with them on the beach. they seemed happier. they took naps. it was hot. some had fans or maybe ac even. but most people didn't need all that extra crap. i mean i like cell phones a little. i like calling from the train ahead and saying: come pick me up! but still. i guess i'm always confused about everything like everyone else is.

i promised i wouldn't make a private entry even when i feel like it. i think i'll keep it. despite weird fears that don't exist."

"event","um. my stomach is caving in. and it looks funny. i get scared people on fgbd will think i'm a bad person, which is REALLY lame. because honestly, i don't know how i got to under 140 all of the sudden or where it came from all of the sudden. and i got scared and stuff. i mean, it's not cute or something like in the movies? like bridget jones, always losing weight. fast and easy but then gaining back. it doesn't just.. go in at the right spots.

<lj-cut text=""i don't think this will upset people but i'll put it here"">
i mean the top is caving in weird but the bottom is still pretty the same. and my legs are pretty the same. it's like.. i'm sinking. and all i wanted was to lose weight this summer. it was most of what i cared about and thought about for awhile. how sweet it would be to weigh under 152 again. how i could weigh my ""normal"" 115-120 but i found these pics.. and you can see for yourself how sick i looked when i got to college. 

http://members.aol.com/quietneuf/worevlif.jpg

there are worse than that.. and i didn't put up the worst i own. i didn't want to and if you want to find the others i'm sure it's easy and i really don't mind you seeing. but the thing is i put these up for someone to see. because they thought maybe things were inadequate where they weren't. that they might be wrong when they were so fucking right about everything.

these pics are me.. sick. me feeling like shit. and i weighed the least i've weighed. i'm 5'3. i've weighed everywhere from 110 lbs-152. and that's not a lot. that's not a lot of span but it's something. and i know when i was sick. i was never anorexic in my life. i was never bulimic when i tried to be.. i couldn't. but the thing is.. i wasn't even happy. weighing the least amount in my life.

i weighed what they said i was supposed to. i fit size 4 abercrombie. i could shop anywhere and sometimes i can't anymore. i can't even FIT into japanese clothing at glamour hut very well prolly. i mean, i tried at a store and there size L was tiny. and maybe that is their bodies. 

but to see that people can't find clothes. to see that people can't have what they want just cause someone was too lazy and too fucked up to make it for them.. that they need 2 plane seats when i don't really think that's so fair. i mean, i don't know. i can't figure things out i guess. maybe you disagree. maybe you think it's okay to pick on fat people sometimes. like in heathers. i don't think you do. maybe you think it's okay that people have it so bad just becuase they look different. it's no different than making fun of someone for being black or white or asian or russian or latino.

honestly, it doesn't seem all that different to me than when my brother calls people kikes and things. when he tells me i'm fat and should burn in the ovens. he does too. it's really really weird.

my sister was never fat and yet she was bulamic for a year in 6th grade. she lost what my parents refer to as ""baby fat"". but she was never fat even. and if she was why should they treat her any less? she's still jenny. i mean why would they treat me different some years when i didn't even gain a lot of weight at all. imagine for the people that did! what their parents must have said, the shit they went through. that's all i guess. i feel like posting this everywhere, how i feel. i dunno why. i wish i could spread it around like butter on bread and tell everyone. but you can't. no one even cares how fucked they are in thinking. they think it's funny or cool or even cute. but it's so fucking lame and terrible. that people are picked on for their size when they never did something wrong ever.

i've seen people make fun on lj a lot. and i've seen people make fun of my friends' personal ads on the internet. i've seen people make websites DEDICATED to hating fat people because.. they are fat. that's it. i've seen my own friends write a love letter to a girl named kim, who was fat. and to make fun of her. it was fake. and i didn't say anything. i can't believe it. i learned from that.. a lot. to always say something to people after that and i did. but i'm sorry i didn't before.
yeah, this is targetted at no one in the world in particular. not really.



so to those of you that are fat. that get picked on like mad, that never did anything to deserve it. i'm sorry that the world is like this. i'm sorry that people who are the same as me do this. but they are not me and i know that you know this too. i'm really embarrassed for society in general i guess. and i shouldn't be since it's not really me at all. but i am... i'm embarrassed people are fucking assholes.

i really can't stop thinking these things. i make internet jokes too. i mean, i made one in a community the other day. but it's not the fucking same. it's never the same. because fat people should not have to take their fat off ever. just like black people can not take their blackness off. yes, you can bleach your skin and YES of course you can fucking lose weight. but why should you have to so people like you at all? it doesn't make sense to me ever. at all."

"event","i just keep crying and crying tonight. sometimes things all go to shit at once (usually for me) and it's scared me that i could regress, etc. etc. it's a weird babyish feeling when you know your mom and sister have probably heard you sobbing for the last hour but have ignored it. a weird unloved, silly stupid teenagerish feeling. and i'm embarrassed for it in a way.

a lot of things have been childish lately and causing me to act that way. my week has just been shit.

-mon: take exam

-tues: try to meet with prof to see what i got, she fails to show up for appt. get yelled at by guard at nyu for staying over too often completely cutting off your ability to see boyfriend anymore in dec. ride 2 subways to find a rat after failing to find one in 2 other pet stores that is suitable.

-wed get picked on by brother, get called a ""kike"" when you aren't even jewish by him along with cunt, fat bitch, ugly loser with no friends.. and the list goes on. sister leaves school early to go shopping instead.

-thurs  brother gets violent with a knife. then starts trying to fake stab himself. then squirts cleaner in his mouth and you have to fight over calling 911 or your dad and when you do call you get yelled at for not calling 911 first. and then the police are over. and your brother is full of revenge because you called. and they take him away in handcuffs in an ambulance. while this is going on sister is at concert called jingle ball with her 150 dollar ticket and 3 new shirts staring kelly clarkson and nelly and destiny's child and whoever else played there.

-fri parents discuss having brother come home early so he doesn't miss much school. freak out internally that he will attack you when he comes home.

-sat go to the dentist where they almost don't take you because someone cancelled your appointment. have sister start up on you. saying you have it easy and are a fat ugly bitch and stupid and lazy and nasty to her. yeah, especially after you picked up that rat for her, searching at least 4 pet stores again and again over a months time, and taking public transit to finally find one cute enough for her. spending 30 dollars in the process cause you just don't care about being ripped off anymore. her most cutting remark is something about what an ex friend's mother thinks of you and what they say about you since you aren't there. you feel sick and cry about it in secret. when sister points out that you are cruel to mom you point out her famous quote of the week: ""mom, i hope you die or get seriously hurt in a car accident"". why did she say this? because my mom wouldn't pick up a dress she was having altered a day early. then later on dad informs you that all of your tuition money is used up and good luck coming up with the rest.

so i guess i'll be dealing with fat issues, paying back loans for the rest of my life, recovering from parental damage, a brother's physical and verbal abuse, and having a sister who just makes you feel as though you are worthless. fuck it."

"event","tonight was the first time i've cried in so long for an extended amount of time. (over 10 minutes). the thing was that my glasses broke and it was like that last straw after hours of cramming (i retain info easily but i hate the time when i'm sucking it up) but i learn very fast actually.

it's just that so many teachers are trying to fuck over my boyfriend including one with a past of sexually harassing a female student. and didn't call up the woman mike works with at disabilities because the prof just didnt' care. 

and i'm so scared because i got housing and it's in the fucking building where i tried to commit suicide but the only other option is 7,000 dollars more and i can't afford that! it's not on the same floor; it's one up. and the room will be a single but i'm still scared. so many bad and good memories; both of which i do not wish to remember since the good makes me feel cruddy too. ie. remembering being best friends with 2 people who ended up really hating me while i lived there two different years. i'm scared people will hate me because i have one out of four singles in a building that holds over a thousand people. and my own bathroom. but i really feel that i'll be screwed without those things and that all of my phobias and problems will come flooding back without the right accomodations. maybe i'm just a spoiled bitch but i remember the paranoia i kept having and the social problems i couldn't handle at all; i really don't know. i don't know if i have a serious problem for real like everyone says or if i'm a drama queen. sometimes i guess you can't tell.

i'm also feeling sort of weird about a strange thing. when i first got this journal i hated how i looked. i hated how i felt. and those two things have subsided. because i felt better i began to excersize almost daily and i got some muscles which i am pretty proud of.. but then i started to lose weight. not rapidly or unhealthily but i finally started to feel okay; i mean about weighing more. and with myself. and i started reading up on acceptance issues and everything. but in the last few weeks i've gone from a little over 152 to 144 and i think i'm still going down. and when i started my goal was to get back to my normal weight of around 125.. but now i don't know. i'm not going to stop excerisizing due to weight loss but i feel sort of funny when people say i look much better or something. i mean, i want to look good and i want to be healthy but i guess i can't explain it at all. and i'm not making sense either. i just wanted to accept myself for myself and i'm scared i'm changing because i don't like how i am. i don't want to alter myself to look acceptable for everyone else and i don't want to feel like i have to change to make myself feel that much better either. but i do want to have muscles and be stronger and healthier. 


i'm very fearful of certain people, especially this one person who would totally recognize where i got my username (it's from a very specific place that she would know about and would probably realize it was me off the bat) and she has gotten a journal here. i really didn't mean to notice it but i did because she joined communities i joined on this journal. and i'm scared that she will find mine by seeing the name. i don't even use this one to post in those anymore; i'm too scared. i don't really hate her or anything but i'm pretty positive she really hates me, or at least strongly dislikes. i don't think about her too much anymore because we've been apart for too long and i really make it a point of not reading her personal journal at this point. of course i slip up at times but i do try because it makes me sad and nostolgic or jealous. i hope things don't get discovered. i don't feel i should have to make up a whole different secret journal just so she doesn't see these things and i'm not locking this. i don't feel like it or like i should have to. it's not about getting comments. (i'm not exactly the comment queen anyway.. and i don't care to be) i really don't know why i don't want to.

my eyes are tired from crying after studying and other stress but i'll be okay and with the heat on i'm sure i'll be asleep pretty fast.

also, i think i have a keloid on my nose and i'm really worried that it will scar or not go away."

"event","i don't know if this is terribly cliche or not but i know what i want to do a zine on if i do end up making one. i don't want it to be how cool or trendy suicide is or anything like that. i wanted to talk about different kinds of death. for example, dying of natural causes vs. an accident that happened at the ""wrong time"" on your social clock. or about the people i knew. i didn't care when my uncle phil died. it just wasn't a big deal; i was thirteen and never knew him. at the funeral i thought about how ""cool"" he looked. or with my aunt may, she had a still birth when she was full term. my mom's good friend lost her husband at the wtc.. and i saw it happen from a few blocks away so i could say something about that (probably also terribly cliche.. don't care). a girl named carrie in sign language only came once because she tried to kill herself after her father had an unsuspected heart attack and died suddenly. i also once tried.. and it's hard for me not to just refer to it as ""the bad thing"" but maybe that's not healthy.

i never got closure on my great uncle dave because my mom sent me to another country when he died. that sounds weird but it's true and i never went to his funeral, or my grandfather's, which was two days later. i still have so much regret.

in hs this girl named sylvia's dad died. and it was so frightening. because we were all so young and i remembered her the day before for some reason, even though we weren't friends. so carefree. nickoletta's dad shot himself in hs because he did something bad and was going to jail. and another girl's father died as well. i always thought mine would because he said it would happen since his dad died young.

my aunt jill died of breast cancer when i was young. her kids were really young too (around my age.. 6 & 9.. i was 8). they danced around at her funeral like it was a party. they knew she was dead but it just didn't really click in that for real sense.

i guess i'm thinking about all of this because my dwarf hamster died and i saw him die slowly in my hand. i think i ever helped him die faster (which i feel very mixed about). it was so terrible though to watch him suffer and although stupid it made me think a lot about my uncle dave and that night the truck hit his car and crushed the life out of him. because i sat there with this little animal and watched life leave another thing. i never really did see my uncle dead though.. so i suppose it is different. 

also stupid but i keep thinking about what donnie darko said.. about dying alone and his dog callie.. and how terrible it is if we really do all die alone. i'm not sure what i think but i feel very odd about it all.

i can't exactly say what it is but i don't want people in my ""real lj"" to know about this stuff. it feels.. dumb almost. i guess i just can't explain it but maybe you know what i mean. death is just such an odd thing that americans tend to fear and i guess i'm just one of many."

"event","i feel kind of sick after excersizing but i think it has to do with me drinking too much water in between things. i did 140 crunches (not at once of course cause i'd die of pain), 65 leg lifts (where you lift your legs and back in the air at once while laying on your back.. ow), 120 squats, and 60 push ups. plus mike and i walked a lot today to see a movie, and then it was sold out so we walked back. 

the thing is i'm not losing weight really (maybe 5 lbs or less) but i don't really care. i do still weigh myself. i mean, i guess it's a terrible habit that i can not break but i like to know a number for some reason. i can feel the muscles growing though, and that makes me happy. i have them in my tummy now, my arms, and definitely my legs. 

i was thinking of getting this tape that is some kind of big warm up for the nyc ballet dancers but then i thought maybe i'm not coordinated enough to do their steps and maybe it would bore me. but i do like classical music and i'd like to get even stronger, you know?

anyway, i think i'm dong pretty well and this is basically a happy update, which is great.. today i got a course book from the nyu intensive graduate study program that i took over the weekends for sign. i want to take 15 credits - 16 next semester if i live here. if they let me back i'd be so thankful. and if not.. well, i don't know what i'd do i guess cause then i could take sign II with tami manor and i'd be a little sad i guess. 

but you know what? i keep getting the rotten deal and i still make it so maybe it will be okay either way."

"event","i'm still feeling pretty good. i mean, of course i have my ups and downs but lately the downs haven't been so low,  if you know what i mean. i am definitely not depressed at this point in my life which makes me wonder about how right all of those doctors who said i could never make it without medications were. by the end they did nothing anyway, except make me ill. i'm not saying meds don't work but i think my time with them was over. i have been off since june, and not getting sick from withdrawel since late sept. and i have been feeling pretty good for the end of sept. and all of oct.

now, november is the month that worries me. it is my birthday and it is the month i seem to fuck up in. it's the month i got arrested. the month i was originally put on medications.. and now it's another year and i'm hoping that nothing happens. i don't know if i believe in luck or not but i think i must because i get superstitious at times about nothing.

i used to do this thing where i'd play snood and then if i got more than 1000 the answer was ""probably yes"" and less than was ""no"" and winning meant ""definitely yes"". i played this wtih solitaire too.. neg score = no, positive score = maybe, winning = yes. i've done this for years. and i ask it questions. only, i get different answers for the same questions at times. but before i went to go back to nyu i kept getting: no, they won't let you back and they didn't. haha. so i got really superstitious.

anyway, i've been having fun and i got really good grades so far. well, maybe not in human dev, which turned out to be an 86, but i'm hoping i ace all of the papers since i'm a good writer. and in sign i got a 90 midterm, 90 quiz, and 100 quiz. i dont know about speech in schools and i'm skipping tomorrow because i'm tired and lazy and don't want to commute. it will be probably the only time i miss it anyway this semester. 

anyway, i'm tired so i guess i'll stop here. not much to report i guess. and that's a very good thing."

anyway, sometimes i get the urge to try dieting again anyway. it's silly because now i feel like if i do i'm being an idiot and ashamed. and like it should be a secret. i even feel embarrassed for eating slim fast bars at times because their commercials are terrible and say things that just aren't true. 

instead of focusing on losing weight i'm now focusing on getting healthier instead. i've been doing about 100 crunches/leg lifts a night, and around 80 squats, and 40-60 push ups. i just want some muscle. and i try not to eat as much bad things cause it just isn't healthy anyway. 

i can't believe earlier this year i took tylenol pm so that i'd sleep instead of eating. i feel so stupid and ashamed about that. how foolish, ignorant, and dangerous.

my brother just got out of the mental hospital for the drug thing. i'm glad i guess but if he hits me i've decided i'll just call the police this time. my parents do nothing.

i think i got an a+ on my sign language midterm and an a-/b+ on human development. i have one left for tomorrow and i'm nervous and i hope i do well.

but i'm feeling much better these days, which is why i write less in my secret journal."

"event","i guess i've been a .little stressed out so i'll come write here. i only use this journal for that sort of thing anyway.

my brother got arrested. i thought it was weird that some people were getting mad at me for saying i'm glad it happened. one person said that it was mean because he could get five years in prison and get anally raped. my brother is 16 and it is his first offense. the drug was pot- not something big like heroine or crack. i doubt that this would send him to jail. i mean, he's already home. he was there for like a few hours.

i am glad. i don't care if people think that i'm a jerk for it. i'd rather him get arrested now than when he is selling coke and carrying a gun or something, because i'm sure most people start off with little things like weed or selling cigarrettes to junior high kids and making a quick buck. 

i'm tired of my brother beating up on me. he really hurt me two weeks ago when he threw me into that dresser and my wrist started bleeded after a lamp fell on me. he broke our telephone by smashing it into the floor. he's been acting nuts ever since he started taking and selling drugs. 

i'd rather him get in trouble as a minor who doesn't have too many connections. people who are saying: well, you shouldn't be happy about this just seem ignorant. perhaps they are drug users. maybe not. one kid said: weed is not a drug. of course it is. it just isn't as bad as cocaine. 

it's not like i want my brother to get in trouble at this point even. i remember how nice things were between us. i read him books when i was in hs and he was in junior high. we started that when i learned to read in elementary school. we played house together as kids and with action figures. my brother and i were really good friends until all of this started and then it went down the drain. i've been pushed and smacked around. and i don't want it anymore.

so no, i'm not sorry. and i won't be. if in some freak case my brother did get jail time (i don't think this is possible for a misdimeanor at 16) i would feel terrible. but he needed be arrested. he is so out of hand. i'm scared he's going to become an alcoholic and he already tried coke and i think lsd. yuck."

"event","it's so freezing in here and so i can't sleep or stop thinking. also, there is a lot of snoring going on which does not help at all.

today i felt it again.. the urge to taken something that didn't belong to me. it happened in the laundry room. some kid left their medium gray nyu hoodie on the table with other stuff. i wanted to take it so badly but then i remembered these cost like 50 + dollars and felt bad. i mean, people have taken my stuff out of the dryer before when i was 10 minutes late and it would've sucked if someone took something of mine. so i controlled myself. why do i constantly have these urges? i did take a chesire cat pin i found on the floor near my dryer, which was bad. but not as bad as taking that hoodie. so i look at it as a plus.

whenever i walk through a detector at a store my heart stops. and if it goes off for some weird reason ie. i have a video rental in my bag my heart leaps out of my throat and i have to vomit. it's almost like how alex would get so sick from seeing violence or hearing classical music in a clockwork orange. things he loved before (bad or good) made him physically ill, just like the thought of shoplifting or alarms makes me.

i had doubts tonight about school. i don't know why but all of the sudden my breathing became shallow and my heart was racing really fast. i just thought about how i have to meet with that dick of a doctor nyu hired and how he could turn me down again so easily. and how simple it would be to get fucked over. but i have finished my observation hours, taken a midterm, written one paper, almost finished another, gone to two of my eight in total sign classes, taken notes, and read what i was supposed to. so i guess that's progress. i mean, it's about half way through the semester and i'm doing okay with commutting and everything. it just gets hard.

man, mike sounds like a rhino or something. i wish he'd help me clean up sometimes. he does help carry the wash upstairs, which is nice of him. and he does let me stay over which i am so grateful for.. so i guess i shouldn't complain. it's just when i think about how we'll hopefully be together someday i wonder if he'll leave food and garbage wherever it falls like he does now. or if his clothing will be piled sky high until i clean it like he does now. i mean, my mom did everything at my house when my parents were married. she cooked, cleaned, made beds, did laundry, dishes, tucked in the kids, grocery shopped, bought everyone's clothing, etc. my dad never helped her and i'm scared that's how it would be with me and mike. but i guess if we talked about it things would be okay. anyway, i'm itchy as hell and i think i'll just sit here and scratch my legs for awhile."

"event","well, i keep trying to lose weight but nothing happens. it's sad i guess. i mean i drink slim fast instead of certain meals and i walked about an hour a few days in a row. maybe i'm supposed to be 30 lbs overweight. i don't know. i like how slim fast tastes anyway so i guess that's good. but i end up feeling guilty just for eating a roast beef sandwich or sushi and i shouldn't. i don't want to turn into those girls who go to ana websites and hate themselves so much. but i want to be myself and it hurts not to be. i guess i'm like every other american who just wants an easy way out. i'll keep trying.

tutoring is hard and i don't like it. it makes me question myself and what i'm doing which i don't like. i just want a good job and good money in my future. and mike. i keep thinking we're going to break up even though things are so nice because i'm so fucking unlucky about things and when i think this i just cry. that is pretty bad but it's true. like i'll wonder why he likes me and why i like him even though we hardly fight and have a great time together and snuggle and watch movies. what is wrong with me? maybe it's this time of  year. i mean last year i almost fucked things up for us for good right about now. i want to wash that away though and never think of it.

i shouldn't be so unsure of myself but i'm afraid to lose any happiness i get my hands on. seriously. i become bitter just thinking about losing it. i guess i'll just keep trying to work things out. i hope i can.

also, i wanted to steal the other day but i controlled myself. why jeapordize everything when i'm doing well? i wish i knew why i had the urge to take things that really aren't m ine. what the hell."

"event","i took a pregnancy test just to be sure even though i was pretty positive i wasn't and of course the stripe in the pregnant box did not appear or anything. i still feel better. you know, people pick on the pregnant teens community a lot but i would give them some credit because that can not be easy and i know i wouldn't be doing it. 

also, my dad wants me to switch therapists which is stupid because i don't trust them and why get a new one to add to the list. i really don't even have very much to say to the one i have at this point. and i need that note so what can i do. i just hope she doesn't pull that: i won't give one crap this time. because then even if she does it still shows that she did not want to. and that looks very bad.

i also wonder why i have lost no weight. i changed what i eat and i eat less and i walk places. why does it do nothing?"

other than that i'm feeling much better. i know it's dumb but i didn't want to post this in my real journal because i know people there from real life or i just don't want them to know and so i put it here. because this is my secret space after all."

"event","i went to therapy and actually talked a little. and it was very bad because i cried for a minute and i promised to never cry there again. but the idiot asked me about yesterday and i said i felt fine, that i didn't care. but then i slipped and said that some idiots wrote in the park: they're not really dead. like, to be all patriotic. but i thought that was stupid. and she said something all comforting like, which just makes me mad and a few angry tears slipped down my face. 

everytime i thought i was going to cry i said to myself: mike's mike's mike mike mike mike's mike. and i slowly calmed down. 

she acted like she'll never write a note. she fucking better. bitch.

but i didn't hate her as much and i guess it's just because time has passed by. but whatever. i guess i'll just keep going because i have to.

also, i think people are idiots about stuff that happened yesterday a year ago. like this girl who didn't even see it happen in nyc.. she lived somewhere far away but now lives in ny was like: oh, i cried so much! because i remembered what day it was! geezes, i saw it happen from less than a mile away. but i didn't squish out fake tears. i knew people that died. they weren't my friends but i knew them. i saw people walking uptown after it happened with pieces and fragments of the buliding all over them. but it's been a year so stop talking about it. i'm mad that i'm even mentioning it. i made sure not to in my other journal. or at least make it minimally. 

i hate idiots."

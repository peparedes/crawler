ABBOTT: Super Duper computer store. Can I help you? 

COSTELLO: Thanks. I'm setting up an office in my den and I'm thinking about buying a computer. 

ABBOTT: Mac? 

COSTELLO: No, the name's Lou. 

ABBOTT: Your computer? 

COSTELLO: I don't own a computer. I want to buy one. 

ABBOTT: Mac? 

COSTELLO: I told you, my name's Lou. 

ABBOTT: What about Windows? 

COSTELLO: Why? Will it get stuffy in here? 

ABBOTT: Do you want a computer with Windows? 

COSTELLO: I don't know. What will I see when I look at the windows? 

ABBOTT: Wallpaper. 

COSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software. 

ABBOTT: Software for Windows? 

COSTELLO: No. On the computer! I need something I can use to write 
proposals, track expenses and run my business. What do you have? 

ABBOTT: Office. 

COSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything? 

ABBOTT: I just did. 

COSTELLO: You just did what? 

ABBO TT: Recommend something. 

COSTELLO: You recommended something? 

ABBOTT: Yes. 

COSTELLO: For my office? 

ABBOTT: Yes. 

COSTELLO: OK, what did you recommend for my office? 

ABBOTT: Office. 

COSTELLO: Yes, for my office! 

ABBOTT: I recommend Office with Windows. 

COSTELLO: I already have an office with windows! OK, let's just say I'm 
sitting at my computer and I want to type a proposal. What do I need? 

ABBOTT: Word. 

COSTELLO: What word? 

ABBOTT: Word in Office. 

COSTELLO: The only word in office is office. 

ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows. 

COSTELLO: Which word in office for windows? 

ABBOTT: The Word you get when you click the blue ""W"". 

COSTELLO: I'm going to click your blue ""w"" if you don't start with some 
straight answers. What about financial bookkeeping? You have anything I 
can track my money with? 

ABBOTT: Money. 

COSTELLO: That's right. What do you have? 

ABBOTT: Money. 

COSTELLO: I need money to track my money? 

ABBOTT: It comes bundled with your computer. 

COSTELLO: What's bundled with my computer? 

ABBOTT: Money. 

COSTELLO: Money comes with my computer? 

ABBOTT: Yes. No extra charge. 

COSTELLO: I get a bundle of money with my computer? How much? 

ABBOTT: One copy. 

COSTELLO: Isn't it illegal to copy money? 

ABBOTT: Microsoft gave us a license to copy Money. 

COSTELLO: They can give you a license to copy money? 

ABBOTT: Why not? THEY OWN IT! 

(A few days later) 

ABBOTT: Super Duper computer store. Can I help you? 

COSTELLO: How do I turn my computer off? 

ABBOTT: Click on ""START"".............

Now on to other matters, i'm getting out another three books after finishing the last three books. These ones are Betrayal (Fiona Mcintosh), Sorcery Rising (Jude Fisher) and Medalion (Jennifer Fallon) We'll see how that goes.

Read some good books ""Magic Study"" (a definatly good read) and ""Shaman's crossing which like hamlet the man of inaction is your character and it's frustrating but it makes valid points. Anywho, time is money friend! (or so the internet cafe man says i have to pay him for it still...)"

"event","Hey! So a few days ago  we went to Moreton Island where we did Sand tobagganing, enjoyed killer waves (okay not killer but BIG waves), camping, and a brisk walk up to the biggest known sand hill in Australia (I think)
I'll upload photos soon! It was pretty fantastic. You know how you think that white sandy beaches only happen in movies? or the extremely colourful fish while your snorkeling? It's true! They're all there! it just amazes me, slightly, of course. It was sweet, but to be true a very salty and sandy experience. Snorkelling was a very intriguing opportunity as our snorkeling first was cancelled and then was back on but we had to share outfits (one group went in first and then we got the westsuits) I unexpectantly recieved really big flippers and couldn't kick in them, but a kind stranger lent me the right pair and I was out about swimming with colour fish. People are friendly!!! :)
As of right now I'm in a conundrum whether or not I want to visit Cairns. I want to see the Reef and the Rainforest but I also want to fo to Uluru (money is really the isssue). And I don't know how much travelling I really wanna do. If we do that we still have a week where I have nothing planned and that's a good thing. I'm thinking of upping my ticket and going home a week early because I have a lot of projects I'd like to get started onn when I get home. That is after everything else is planned out. Also I might be going to Vanuatu for a bit, but I can't count my chickens yet. I still have to see if I can get the full week off.
I miss you all~! Send me a text or something and tell me how life is, because working full time and waiting to go on trips is boring... perhaps next week dreamworld? or actually start poker? Maybe poker, yes that's it. It's kindda a long story as to why we haven't played poker down here and so BLAH!

Also, I was wondering if Katie is reading this, if she tried to send the Mytreat Card because I remember her or someone else mentioning they might, if so, it hasn't come and I was worried. And if not, then that's fine too! It's just been a worry on my mind and wondering if mail had messed it up.

And as Mandie puts it: ""Love and Fudge!""
I miss you all! And if you have any wonderful stories I'd love to hear, or rant too :)

ttyl!

I haven't been up to much lately - just saving and waiting. Today I'm going to find out why I'm being taxed more money than I need to be. *Sigh* I kindda know why but the gov't needs to explain it better.
Hopefully everyone had a good new years etc etc.
I just heard my asm is now an ASM! Craig is getting a store... something like Park Royal or yeah. I'm super happy for him! Go Craig!

I graduated, left home, currently am living abroad, had a few reality checks, realised how much i've taken for granted with friends and family. The people i do miss, and those i never think about. I really miss my family. I realize we're all getting older, and i wanna do something with them before time takes everyone too far away.

And i feel old. I'm almost 19 now. Responsibilities much? I can't blame it on bein' a teenager now, can't I? :P

Things are good, for now :)


I think coming here is good, gonna go dye my hair and cut it with Jess, a friend.

"event","Hey Everybody!

I must say I'm going to try and buy a fridge on friday and get it delivered. I've been thinking about how horrible I've been eating and it's time for a fridge. I really want SALADS despite everything. I hate the idea of being able to eat fruit but have nothing to do with vegetables except in my V8 drinks. Haha. Lame. Really.

Regarding my TFN as of right now, I know the number and they are mailing it to my address. I'm not too sure how to get the refunded money back so I shall ask Stephanie how to. However, I should be getting my full pay now.

Yesterday we went to Movie World. It's a small themepark, smaller than Playland and a shitload more expensive. If you think $30.00 is bad, this one was 52.00 plus being driven there and everything (22.00 each) It was expensive and not really worth it but they did have some cool rides. I'm probably not going to be doing anything else until after x-mas. I'm not even sure if my family expects presents. I'm just thinking of giving them all gifts when I get home. Right now it's expensive to send presents and they may not even arrive back in time. However I would like to call them on x-mas and if they're all at grandma's that would be fantastic. That's a hint, Laura ;)

Poker has turned out to be dead. Nobody is even bothering with the idea of actually wanting to come over and play. They all have to work or have other plans. It's kindda sucking.

Overall life is good right now. I'm hoping the same for everyone. I'll try and get a digital camera or something to show you what it's like here. I'm not missing Vancouver as much as I have been lately. Slowly getting used to the fact I'm down here and staying. Currently I'm a lot happier with working right now because I'm working at Shaundra's store. hehe.

However I still miss you all, Casey."

Wow.
I came back to find so many e-mails in that dratted box of mine! hahah, i was worried i'd run out of library time and have to pay for internet ;)
But thanks :) (and other too, such as mrs. mulder and janice, and others :P)
It was definatly a self esteem booster to hear from all of you. 
It's so hot here. I can't even begin to describe it :9 Well, i'll attempt at least.
You see, my dilemma isn't just the heat. It's my apartment. While it's got screen doors for the kitchen window and bathroom, it doesn't for the sliding doors. So, late at night the two bedroom apartment gets stuffy. So, i'll open the doors to get that refreshing breeze. The breeze is nice...but did you ever wonder what was equivelent to racoons and spiders? The doors allow the salamanders in. The salamanders climb my walls, and the move really really fast. They're harmless from what i can tell, just awkward to be around. The cockroaches on the other hand, are gross. I've found two dead in the last three days. One in my washroom and another one in one of the bedrooms. Eeep. Luckily, they've been dead both times. So the cockroaches are the spiders, and believe me, they're everywhere. Especially because of the humidity, they live all throughout the city, and when i say they're everywhere, i mean that food safe is shit here, and i know for a fact that they're in Myer centre and it's creepy. As half the center is a food court. 'Nuff said. Now, the racoons are what i would call the possums. My gawd, they climb through the gates, and even tried to get into the room. Yes, they do for a fact climb three flights of outside stairs to get to my flat. Well, yeah. fun.
Work is fun for me but unfortunatly two full time people are quitting :( boo. BUT, casey has been asked to work at my store for 2 days, and that means she'll be getting away from the store that's crazy :D.
Hmm, i finally got paid by starbucks! Yay...it went all to rent Xd so, next week (i think) we're gonna go either outlet shopping with Jenette? or Dreamworld or something, haven't decided :) Jenette is from abbotsford and hasn't been to any of the major theme parks yet, can you believe that!? so she's decided she's going to come with us. It's kindda quirky how many people are from B.C./Seattle area.
I would like to say i haven't spent all my canadian money, but yeah i had too because of the three/four weeks that i didn't make any money. My last bit of that money went to a monthly bus pass and two weeks rent. I'm trying to get ahead in rent so that when i do plan to do a 5 day scuba diving trip i won't have to factor in rent and stuff. That and the rainforests. The only two major trips i think i can plan for and have enough money for is Cairns (scuba and rainforest) and Kings canyon and Ares Rock. New Zeland and Tasmania is cutting it tight, i'd love to, but i wouldn't mind coming back, if only for a few weeks. Now all i gotta wait on is that TFN, i really hope it comes soon...
Poker hasn't started yet, it's still in the beginning phase, but soon enough, soon enough. Muahhahha, and Yes Curt, i will try to take their money, but you gotta factor in beginers luck...eeep :P


I'm dealing with bouts of lonliness, should you say. Nothing too big, it's just when you don't really know anyone, it gets lonly, and sometimes depressing. Nothing too bad ;) I'm making friends the slow way. And i've been reading a lot....

I bought a tv? That's new, or rather, i haven't mentioned it. A television and a dvd player. Rented the television series numb3ers. It was kindda fun to follow. They're behind here, a season or so, with a lot of television series such as house m.d., and music. Music that was popular when i left is now coming out, so is movies too. Kindda strange, if i say so myself. De ja vu like. 

Oh, i never told you guys about the Barrista Bears. You know how Starbucks always have those stupid bears that they dress up for different seasons? Well for Christmas they have them in the green apron saying Australia on them. They're so soft and cute, and i need to buy some.
My only wish gift is Toffee Nut syrup lol. They don't carry it here :( It's sad, i got addicted to it before i left. MMMm toffe nut hot chocolate...

Aww and Jeff (from starbucks) sent me SNOW photo's. Boy, i wish i coulda seen that much snow. It's been too long. Haha, Casey and Jenette were talking about snow and home and memories of how we use to build igloos way back when. I remember building one with Laura and Casey and Kristi. Scotty just looks at the two as they go on about snow and says ""Canadian's are weird""

And as always, i can try to plan out my adventure here, but in reality i know that it isn't possible, so what i do do and what i say i'm gonna do may be two different things ehehe ;) The only thing i kindda realised with a sad regret is the fact tbat when i go back to school (which i plan to be next January and September won't be available) is that i'll be 20 when i start school. That kindda hit me, and it hit me hard. 1 1/2 years of time off really takes a toll...
Well whatever :) I don't even really know what i want to do, i just wanna go to school, i want to do hospitality, but in some ways, i'm doubting it, i do want to do some psych. stuff too. Just learn me thinks. 
*shrug*
... I'm outta time my friends, 
Talk to you all later.
I hope this all made sence, sorry for the sence of urgency."

"event","So I hear it is snowing in Vancouver. I have seen some wonderful pictures of the snow and it makes me slightly homesick.
Work has been interesting. Actually, I'm not in the best mood to like it. Probably because it isn't like Vancouver. I'm kindda wanting to go home because I know how everything works there and not here. I miss my store manager(s) who were nice and kind and the people, who had characteristics and not just the normal party barista. I can't say my new manager really is nice. She's a mix of everything. Her barista's aren't trained properally and I point out their faults. I'm being trained wrong and I wish there was a way to make it so I'm not assimulated but change how the store works. Good luck with that, right? I hate it. I really miss home in that sense too.
After my TFN comes, I hope to go to Dreamworld with a few coworkers from Shaundra's store. Shaundra's store has people who have characteristics and aren't all girls. They are really nice, we're hoping to start playing poker with them... somethin' to do... right now all I'm watching are movies and tv because I can't think of anything else to do. I'm really low on money... like low low. So besides eating and paying rent doing anything is absolutely a no no. (need TFN) I'm at the library now, so that makes it a bit easier. I plan to phone home today, soon. maybe people will be home?"

Still in a drought and they are thinking of using recycles sewage water for drinking purposes. I'm not a fan of it at all. I don't know what else to say. I've been reading a lot due to the lack of not knowing anybody, or have a t.v., a frigde or a dvd player. My apt is bare. Um I read ""dragon Weather"" a 600 page book about revenge. A little tiresome really. I am at the library now (free intrenet, yay!!!)

I;m going to Steve Irwin's Zoo on Sunday! But for now, grocery shopping before work. It's a bit harder because I have to budget for food while maintaining my rent and buying nothing that can go bad if not in a fridge and obviously not mine because I don't have one.  I miss cheap fruit! and veggies. And snow and rain, haha but I'll see a lot of that when I get back. Not much money left I just need Starbucks to kick in.

"event","Hey hey.
Where to start? 
uh...
Hrm.
 So i left you guys in the middle of my hostel stay at the YHA brisbane, didn't i. They wanted 5 DOLLARS and hour to do internet. Currently, i'm at a cafe that charges 2 dollars an hour. :) woot.
So i found an apartment in Red hill. It's a suburb that's after spring hill. Don't ask me what that means. I just use it to direct people.
My apartment is spacious. It's got two bedrooms and it's somewhat funished. It honestly reminds me of Grandma's old funiture although we have a completly redone kitchen. The bathroom and the bathtub are in two completly different rooms, so you have to go to the other room to wash your hands. Geez, it's definatly been different. You really forget about the practical things that you need. And that's to say that I mean we arrive, only to realize there's no fridge, no bedding/pillows, and definatly no toilet paper. We needed to go shopping.
Suffice to say, i still don't have a fridge. But i do have powder milk. And eggs don't actually need to be refridgerated. You learn these things, when you don't have one. That's for sure. So yeah. Things are expensive. We're really lucky in B.C. because fruit and veggies are REALLY cheap there. it costs about 1.00 a fruit here. Yes, no kidding. They weigh everything in KG so the signs say things such as 11.95/kg. Not to mention everyone gets paid a lot more. Casuals (That's what they call us as were not part time nor full time, so we don't get those type of benefits, and thus, get paid more) get about 2 dollars more an hour, and they have an entire system based on age, and are really good about looking out for the common worker. So everything in relative perspective is more expensive. Sigh. I'm rambling, but yeah. Trying to put down as much as i can. Canadian money may be worth a LITTLE more, but with everything being more, it's really not. My bond on the apartment was 4 weeks of rent (@270/week) and i paid two weeks in advance. buh bye canadian money because i also had to buy work stuff and food to live on, it's been iteresting. I still have about half give or take of my money, but the big expense is over. Once my TFN comes back (it's the tax file number, upon if i don't have it the gov't taxes me at almost half my paycheck) i'll be able to make rent. Currently, i'm a sitting duck until i get that number as i won't make rent until they reimburse me and start paying me properly. ai ya ya. 
So i still haven't done anything in Brisbane because i can't really afford to be spending any more money until i can make rent. Supposedly there's some nice walks you can do, which is free, but it's so bloody hot! Well, i start tommorow! Woot :)
I'm  nervous about starting. They write things differently. Well, whatever. i'm happy to be doing something i somewhat know.
Oh, oh, oh. I've been reading a lot. I read the Anne Mccafrey book and the amber one, and now i'm on Poison Study. I have to say, of all three, the best reading is Poison Study, and i'm not even done. The Pern book was a little bit of a bore, until the end and the amber one was targeted to such a young age, connecting the dots weren't that hard, was it any fun to guess what was going to happen next. 
I found the library too. Yes, the library. A place that never changes. So we went there to find information on how to obtain a fridge. My god, it was hard, and by the end of it, i said all to hell with it, and am not getting a fridge yet. Well, they have radiorentals which can lend you a fridge for like 10/week but i haven't really decided on what action to do. I feel like a sitting duck. Guess what, the libraian was really helpful. He reminded me of Laura and Adrian and someone else in that he spent an hour finding things. At this time, i was rather pessimistic, and was like, i don't know what the hell i'm doing, and i'm bored out of my mind as i have no friends. He laughed at that, and offered a hand of friendship. Well, first he asked what friends we hung around and i almost said ""You know the products of society that aren't normal"" and decidely scapped that to say ""You know, gamers, my sister's a librarian. Laid back people."" 
It'll be nice to have someone show us around and get us out of the house. I go to bed so damn early, i feel like i'm old. 
ok ok enough pessimism.  

OOOH i need to tell you about the bush turkeys. YES, they're wild.
So when we went to ""inspect"" our apartment, we're walking up a street and there's this chicken, or so i thought walking across the street. No joke. It's head was bobbing and it mainly avoided us, but we could hear it. Odd. Then there's these birds that we wake up to in the morning that sound like a turkey but aren't. and they're loud, so loud. You know the bird that you hear in spring that does a high pitch then low pitch sound almost like a whistle. They're like that, but sound like turkeys. The turkey is called a bush turkey and this guy from the hostel laughed at us for being bewildered. I've seen a few coloured birds, no koalas or kangarooos. I plan to go to the zoo soon. Once i have some money. I use to tell jokes to people where upon i'd say. I'm just about to cook breakfast in my imaginary pan only to place it in my imaginary plate. I'm enjoing it immensly.
Uuuuuuh. What else?

CoNtAcT InFo:
Please don't call these too often, as i only have a limited amount of pay-as-you-go minutes.
Also, be reminded that you dial 0061+7+ NUMBER if you're calling from North America. Don't ask the operator to do it for you, as they will charge you about 11 dollars. 
So it's like this:
Shaundra: 0401949856 or if you're dialing it it's 006170401949856 i think.
Casey: 006170413205901
To dial australia you need the (+61), then the area code which is (07) although when dialling you don't add the 0 then the number.

Address:
7/22 Lemnos Street, Red Hill, Brisbane, QLD 4059

You would read this as: Apartment 7 of building 22. That took me forever. Ehehe.
And i really hope to send home some Christmas gifts, but lettme first work on getting enough to pay rent ;)"

"event","Where do i start?
So we boarded the vancouver plane destined for Korea then Singapore only to realise that the 18 hour flight would take a while... We met another traveller in the line-up (don't remember his name) but he was spending 6 months in Australia/New Zeland and going at different times. He had graduated University, and yet his mother was there with him, chatting us up for fear of what was going to happen. Well, he sat to the right of the woman from Perth, who was going home. She talked about how she was bringing her mom Maple Syrup from Canada every year because of how much it was worth it. The only reason we got on the subject was that Casey brought up Honey made in Australia has a different  taste because the bees pollunate certain flowers, leaving a beautiful aftertaste. Well, i do plan to buy some, so who wants some COOL honey? (Leave a comment dammit!)
So the seating was Casey<>Shaundra<>Jules (perth woman><serving ile<>dude going to Australia/New Zeland. 
It was fun, great people, great converstation, and did i mention GREAT AIRLINE. Singapore Airlines has amazing customer service. The seats all had mini televisions to watch movies and t.v. They had an on-demand movies and television shows that were over at least 80 different ones. The remote even let you play Nintendo, mostly Kirby, chess, and the water pipe game i used to play on my dads computer. it was the same time as chips challenge. The food, don't get me started. Delicious for airline food. They even served us red wine, white wine, screwdrives (and other vodka drinks), beer, Apple juice, Orange juice, Pineapple (i had this most of the time), and others. Lets just say they gave us a menu. Mmmmm amazing. 
Korea was kindda cool, i wish i could have explored it more... :( confined to the airport. 
Singapore. Ah, singapore, singapore, singapore. I never will go back. It's Thursday right? Guess what? I'm in Sydney, at my YHA in central downtown. You want to ask me why? Well yes, i'm gonna tell you dammit.
Singapore, was hell, in a handbasket. The only nice people were the taxi drivers. The hostel we prepaid for was in the RED LIGHT DISTRICT. Yeah, gross, discusting, and forms of a nightmare. We stayed ten minutes before realizing we're getting the fuck outta there. Our Taxi driver told us it was a bad place, we paid, so we went. Only to find RATS the size of my hand's fists clasped tightly together. Bugs everywhere, and people eyeing us weirdly. We grabbed another taxi to take us to a hotel, because right now all we wanted was some sleep. This taxi driver was cool, he gave us a little tour in the taxi around, saying that it's a safe place and such, and that we'll find somewhere. We ended up in their little india in a hotel that cost us 55 singapore dollars a night. it wasn't pretty, the shower had a weird pull off, and no shower curtain, the beds looked dirty (So right now, i'm thanking those that told us to bring a bed sheet and Kristi's blanket) and casey slept. I stayed up watching tennis, too depressed to do anything. It was 4:30am, and i wanted to call Tasha, to move our flight up. So we went downstairs, to talk to the woman at the counter and paid 10 singapore dollars for a card. We tried to dial the north shore, but couldn't get it and every time we did it wrong, the maching would take a dollar. Good times. The woman at the counter told us how to do it, but we didn't get it, and because she already told us once, she started yelling at us. Yelling. We stayed at the hotel for a total of 3 hours, as our plane landed at 11:30. Jules made sure we got our baggage and stuff, and was really sweet to us. She wanted to make sure we'd be ok. And because of her, everything went a little smoother. After leaving the hotel, we went directly to the Airport and had to wait three hours for Singapore something or other ticket moving thing to move up. We were leaving. Casey tried to call from the airport. She left her wallet on top of the machine, and got really mad (because at this point our self esteems and everything else was in a hole, and we were kindda depressed). She stormed off, i followed, leaving the two wallets behind. This was all of our singapore money, and all of casey's indentification other that her passport and birth certificate. She lost it all, as someone picked it up. That was the final straw, and we said to hell, and got our ticket bumped up to the 9:30 flight to sydney. Oh, it also had our ""My treat"" visa card in it as well. Bloody hell. As i write this, Casey is calling Visa to get it replaced. Sorry, there is not pictures, i haven't really had time. The flight to Sydney was alright. casey and me didn't get seats together, but enjoyed our time. I took this opportunity to try and sleep, but it didn't happen. I read ""Ember light"" or whatever, the entire plane ride and finish it. I liked it. The old indian dude that sat next to me was annoying, but talkative. The girl after him was from Paris, and doing her final schooling at Sydney Univesity, kidda cool! Ok, really cool.
So here we were, in the sydney airport, with out any cluuuuuuuuue as to what we were doing. The worst part yet was that i couldn't find the monkey that wasn't full of barrels. Or rather, my Sydney money. Oh, fucking great. We had no money. And no travellers checks, oh good times. (I'm gonna save the drama, i found the barrel this morning, so no worries, really!)

If you are reading this, leave the PROPER spelling (lol, whoops, learn2spell casey!) of your mom's name, and if she has the receipt from the Visa card. This is the only way we can freeze the account.
***************************************
You know what's really cool, the airport. They have an entire little booth/center dedicated to backpackers. This is where we started. We got our dates that were booked for the 6th-9th, bumped up, and are at our wonderful hostel. People are nice :)The showers didn't scare me, neither did the beds. And i slept well for the first time in 3 days. Now i'm off to go do something. We're thinking of taking the Sydney walking tour, and stuff. Well we're off, as it's 8:58 am, and i'm  just happy to be in a common wealth country. Singapore, never, ever again. Or maybe when i'm a little more traveller saavy, but that won't be for a loooong time.
See ya :)

"event","YO. Shaundra here.
Nothing comes to mind, but as much as that is said do i have as much to talk about. I think of all the things i've done lately, and they don't amount to much. Although, i am exited about the up and coming trip (4 days!!!) i'm also really happy i'm getting that break from work. Starbucks is fun yes, but after 6 days of being there i'm burnt out. Burned out to the point of making random drinks with my partners because of it. 

For some reason i looked up questionly and asked to Dan: ""I wonder what Strawberries and Chai would taste like...blended."" Dan looks at me queer and replies with : ""Probably not so good."" Jeff stands across from Dan because he has just gotten off and wants a drink. Jeff says: ""Why don't you just try it?"" With that, i look at both of them and blend it togheter. It was ... eh. Not bad. Not tasty. So it gets an Interesting slapped across it. 

Then, Dan decides that he's going to take all of our syrups (vanilla (sf as well) Hazelnut (sugar free as well), toffee nut, almond, peppermint, cinnamon, blackberry, raspberry, melon, coconut, valencia, caramel, classic (sugar water), cinnamon dolce, Chai, White Mocha, Chocolate Mocha, Matcha Powder *green tea*, Vanilla bean and chocolate chips.) and blend it together.  We try it. The response taken is, meh. but suddenly each taste hits a different part of the tongue sending revolts of tastes everywhere. It's after effects don't work too well on the stomache, either. 

As Dan made his experiment (and believe me, it took him like 4 minutes) Jeff and myself talk about blending pasty items. We look at each other, and with that, i pick up the Chocolate Peanut butter oat bar and dice it up, and shove it in the blender along with some coffee base and ice.  I take it out, pour three portions and we all try it. The only thing to come out of my mind was. ""Hmm. We need to find a way to get rid of the oaty part.""

That night shall go down as ""The blended Chocolate Oat fudge bar night""

Ummm, 

I quit wow. My gamecard just ran out and i feel no need to go online anymore. I've decided there's more to do in life than that game. So fuck the game.

I look at the money for Australia. It's ok, it's gonna be ok. We'll be leaving prolly a little later like late Oct/ or sometime Nov. 

Gonna go have a social life, me thinks.

However, it seems like fun because Mandy, Brendan, Craig (who's dad owns the place) Steph, and many others. Apparently there is a lake and we can swim. I don't have a bathingsuit, so I'll look into one. I'm not that confortable showing anything about my body as crazy as that sounds. I'm not okay with my figure. I know this, and one day I'll be happy with myself. Though, I still want a bathingsuit.

topic 3: Wow. We're playing it again. I'm not sure for how long. It sounds absurd b/c the guild is g disbanind and all the rest. I'm not sure where I will get with it, all I know  is that I want to catch up to hexor.

topic 4: LJ. Sorry if I haven't replied to your comments or anything else. Things keep me busy and I forget. I appologize.

I'm good. Time to read some manga~"

Being reading/gaming and other stuff to pass the time.

I need a second job.
Indigo. I have three people that i'm gonna ask for reference into the Indigo. If that falls thru, i just don't care anymore, i'll just not do anything. If i have money or not, i'll still be in Australia, doing something.

It's trippy and you don't have to be on anything to get tripped out! So looking for something, go watch that. I'm about to watch the Family Stone because of Rosea's reccomendation and then...well then i have no plans. Casey's heading off to work, and i'll either call some people or have a little downtime from doing so much with people. I've had an awesome week, especially with the weekend, and hope that it continues to be this cool. Today's Tuesday? Yeah, i'm no crazy, damn getting all the days mixed up XD

I am also going to the midnight showing of Pirates of the Carribean thursday duh duh duuuun.

Oh yeah! And you know what else is COOL!? The Australia Holiday's Workers visa (because i haven't mentioned it yet, but i've known for awhile) has extended it's 3-month visa to 6 months. So everyone, i'm gonna be gone for more like 6-7 months in Australia, plus the time in New Zeland and 2 weeks - 1 month in the Phillipines. If i have time, i'm gonna fit Fiji in there!~ It's gonna be awesome! I just wish i had more money to go with. It's looking like i'm gonna be about 3 thousand dollars shorter because Starbucks just can't give me and Casey enough hours :( but hell, we're still up for that challenge. I'm appin' for my Visa purdy soon, like today if i have enough time after the movie :D

Save money save money save money save money save mon...save money..save...


Have a good time, everyone. I hope your summer is rocking as much as mine :)"

It rocked. And when i say it rocked, it was amazing. there was 11 counsellor's and we all got along. That's rare. Sham was our Senior counsellor, she was cool. Then Mcduff (Craig), Book (Brenden), Nova (Mandy), Carebare (Alexandra), Tinkerbell (Jackie), Cobweb (Lara), Fry (Stephan), Buzz (amelia? Amelie?), Tardy (she was late so we gave her a nickname, Megan), and Cascade (Lynn) :D :D :D :D
I have some really cool campfire videos too :P
They were chaging the menu around, but i have to say the food for egetarians SUCKED. Once over half the schools left, the counsellors were so bad. ""rolemodles"" my ass. When only 1 school was left we dumped water on Fry and doused him. Muhahaha. Fry stuck a slug in Casey's hair and Tinkerbells too! hehehe. We even made plans after. We went to go see X-men 3, final stand. I have to say overkill on the Special effects. Then we were all crashing at Shams house, whereupon Nova drove us home :) I went to sleep feeling sore, and woke up sore and now i write this. I can't say i've had a better ODS experiance, other than being so tired from camping and that all the kids were french immersion. Not only that, it was 4 schools from the lower mainland. One from Squamish, Whistler, North Van, and Langley. Buzz, tardy and Cascade were all from one of the frenchy schools and yeah it was cool, other than i didn't speak french. :)

Now it's time to do some grusome homework. Ooooor not

A co worker of mine got close to her before she passed away on monday, and she's glad she did. She was doing the treatment for lukemia but it didn't go so well. The lady all told us she would depart from our world in under 6 months. We all knew, but we wish she could of stayed. She was a sweet woman who cared a lot about the people who worked at my location, and we all did too.
I found out last night, sadly enough. I decided not to go to David Badgers awake because the emotions of everyone would be overwhelming and I don't know much more than that. I'm not sure how to deal with death, but standing in a room full of people crying, isn't something I think I could do. I've never been to a funeral before.

Lawyers/clients
Public
Students
Dogs

So Mackenzie phoned him up and told Mr. Hockley we can't go...

So the places that have been robbed and never been on the news in the last couple of months:

Royal Bank (the dude came into wendy's. Rosea took his order. Then the cops came and they had to evacuate wendy's. They caught them)
Credit  Undion (NSCU) Was robbed less than a week after
Bank of Montreal was robbed. Then they hit chevron. 2 hits. one day.
The tanning salon beside Wendy's was robbed twice. Once before  RB and once during this time.
A&W was robbed. Dumasses you could see them counting their money from where people ordered.
Grandview Wendy's was robbed.
TD bank was robbed tooo. Dunno when that happen  but i heard about it from someone who works at Park and Tilford.

The only reason that every place has been robbbed and not wendy's is that i think that they're a ""regular customer"" and that if they robbed us we'd be able to easily identify them. That still doesn't mean we can't get robbed or immune. So umm...yeah. SCARY.

I noticed Earth Sea was based off the books by Ursula K. Le Guin and went to check her out on the web. All I read was: Sci fi channel fucked things up through racial differences, not sticking to plot line and some other stuff. The author was all bitchy about how it became was a slap in the face. Yeah dude when you sign for a deal with hollywood are they going to stick to plot line? fuck no. Also movies are done for the general audience and from the sounds of her books it was more 16 and older.
(Look at J.K. Rowling they aren't sticking to the books as much as they could, and Tamora Pierce she realizes that she could never sell her work to Hollywood because she knew she'd get fucked up the ass.)

I still  reccomend the movie that is, if you wanna sit down and just watch something that'll keep you entertained."

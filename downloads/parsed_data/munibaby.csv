hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails, 
I want to eat your skin like a whole almond. 

I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body, 
the sovereign nose of your arrogant face, 
I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,

"event","i have friends in several local florida bands.
all of these bands have sites and boards.

well one board got shut down.

other people started a fansite. with a board.
two brothers are getting blamed.
both are in bands here in florida.
good musicians.

they can play nearly any instrument that you put in front of them, and i respect them greatly. i may end up being in a band with one of them later next year.

and they're getting blamed for this.
fuckers.
they're being called fat cocksuckers, and the shit is so hitting the fan that it apparently nearly came to blows in the mall.

fucking stupid.

and i know who started this fucking thing. grrr.

hmm....these guys are playing near me soon.
maybe i should make a little visit.
with some fruit.

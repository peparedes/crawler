"event","Fall Out Boy Carpal Tunnel Of Love Lyrics 

We take sour sips from life's lush lips.
And we shake, shake, shake the hips in relationships.
Stop by this disaster town; You'll put your eyes to the sun and say ""I know.""
You're only blinding to keep back what the clouds are hiding.
And we might have started singing just a little soon.
And we're throwing the stones in a glass room.

Whoa ah oh, we're so miserable and stunning.
Whoa ah oh, far from the genuine becoming.

We keep the beat with your blistered feet.
We bullet the words at the mockingbirds, singing.
Slept through the weekend and dreamed we're sinking with the melody of the kiss of eternity.
Your pulse comes from a pharmacist, saying ""How you been?""
We might of said good byes just a little soon.
(Somehow this disaster town)
Our beliefs of kissing beats over this room.

Whoa ah oh, we're so miserable and stunning.
Whoa ah oh, far from the genuine becoming.
Whoa ah oh, we're so miserable and stunning.
Whoa ah oh, far from the genuine becoming.

It was icecream headaches and sweet avalanche when the pearls in our shells come out to dance.
This is what you get for abusing sweet love.
Take off your clothes, it hurts just right.
What happens I'm okay; diving into knives don't cut me.
Think you could call me when you get home?
Take your self apart find yourself with love.

Whoa ah oh, we're so miserable and stunning.
Whoa ah oh, far from the genuine becoming.
Whoa ah oh, we're so miserable and stunning.
Whoa ah oh, far from the genuine becoming.

You only hold me up like this
Cause you don't know who I really am
Sometimes I just want to know what it's like to be you
We're making out inside crashed cars
We're sleeping through all our memories
I used to waste my time dreaming of being alive 
(now I only waste it dreaming of you)

Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
Cause all of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase
Like I'll never be the same

You only hold me up like this
Cause you don't know who I really am
I used to waste my time on

Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
Cause all of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase
Like I'll never be the same

I've got headaches and bad luck but they couldn't touch you, no
I've got headaches and bad luck but they couldn't touch you, no
I'm not trying
You only hold me up like this

Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
Cause all of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains
Like I'll never be the same"

Black Mamba


We've got one chance to break out
And we need it now
'Cause I'm sick and tired of waiting
Sick of this fricken apartment

Love me or leave me or rip me apart
This is the voice that I was given and
If you don't like it take a long walk
Off of the shortest pier you can find
And I'll be singing it out I'll be singing...

Oh, Mr. Magazine
I never wrote one single thing for you
Or your so-called music scene
You don't mean a thing to me

Pick it up, pick it up, what you wanted
Pick it up, pick it up, you need it too
Pick it up, pick it up, what you wanted
Pick it up, pick it up

When they review the debut
What if the critics hate you
Don't worry cause they
Might just catch somebody off their feet

Well they can love it or leave it or rip it apart
We're living what we're singing
So I guess that's a step in the right direction
Clever composition and the honesty, honesty

Oh, Mr. Magazine
I never wrote one single thing for you
Or your so-called music scene
You both mean krap to me

Pick it up, pick it up, what you wanted
Pick it up, pick it up, you need it too
Pick it up, pick it up, what you wanted
Pick it up, pick it up

So save your breath and the money you spent
Go work in retail and spare the suspense
Just don't take chances on anything at all
Anything at all

So afraid of anything that may not come that easy
Too afraid of anything you may not have seen before
So afraid of anything that may not come that easy
Too afraid of anything that may not...

Pick it up, pick it up, what you wanted
Pick it up, pick it up, you need it too
Pick it up, pick it up, what you wanted
Pick it up, pick it up

So save your breath and the money you spent
Go work in retail and spare the suspense
Just don't take chances on anything at all
Anything at all

So save your breath and the money you spent
Go work in retail and spare the suspense
Just don't take chances on anything at all
Anything at all"

Drink down that Gin and Kerosene,
And come spit on bridges with me,
Just to keep us warm
Light a match to leave me be (light a match to leave me be.) 

I keep my jelousy close 'cause,
It's all mine.
And if you say this makes you happy,
Then I'm not the only one lying.

[Chorus: x2]
Keep quiet,
Nothing comes as easy as you.
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret
And your biggest mistake.
The hand behind this pen relives a failure every day.

I keep my jelousy close 'cause,
It's all mine.
And if you say this makes you happy,
Then I'm not the only one lying.

Drink down that Gin and Kerosene,
And come spit on bridges with me,
Just to keep us warm.
Light a match to leave me be (light a match to leave me be.)

[Chorus x2]

So wear me like a locket around your throat.
I'll weigh you down.
I'll watch you choke.
You look so good in blue.
You look so good in blue.
[x3]
[chorus x3]"

""Sugar We're Going Down""

Am I more than you bargained for yet
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(A notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
[x2]

Is this more than you bargained for yet
Oh don't mind me I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
[x2]

Down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And Sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down, down (down, down)
Down, down (down, down)
We're going down, down (down, down)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And Sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it"

"event","MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE LYRICS

""Disenchanted""

Well I was there on the day
They sold the cause for the queen,
And when the lights all went out
We watched our lives on the screen.
I hate the ending myself, 
But it started with an alright scene.

It was the roar of the crowd
That gave me heartache to sing.
It was a lie when they smiled
And said, ""you won't feel a thing""
And as we ran from the cops
We laughed so hard it would sting

Yeah yeah, oh

If I'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
Now will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learn a goddamned thing.

You're just a sad song with nothing to say 
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong, 
This never meant nothing to ya

I spent my high school career
Spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes
Sell a car on tv
Bring out the old guillotine 
We'll show 'em what we all mean.

Yeah yeah, oh

If I'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
Now will it matter long after I'm gone?
Because you never learn a goddamned thing.

You're just a sad song with nothing to say 
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong, 
This never meant nothing to ya

So go, go away, just go, run away.
But where did you run to? And where did you hide?
Go find another way, price you pay

Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah 

You're just a sad song with nothing to say 
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong, 
This never meant nothing to ya, come on

You're just a sad song with nothing to say 
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong, 
This never meant nothing to ya

At all, at all, at all, at all"
